The self absorption of wife is unreal.", "I wonder what their wedding was like", "So, this is my unwashed opinion and I could be very wrong, but this is how I\u2019m reading it.\n\nThe covert narcissist is different from the standard narcissist. The covert narcissist is deeply insecure and lashes out at others when their fragile ego is challenged. They also need to constantly be made to feel extremely special to compensate for their insecurity. When that doesn\u2019t happen, they blame everyone else around them. In their world things don\u2019t just happen, others are to blame. Then they challenge the reality of the situation by trying hard to convince the other person that the covert narcissist\u2019s view of the world is accurate. They are extremely good at gaslighting, and that is very abusive to the other person in the relationship.\n\nTo me this read very much like that type of situation: Fragile ego, not enough attention/attendance at the party, leaves to have pity party and the poor significant other believes that it\u2019s at least partly their fault and is distraught because they don\u2019t know what to do to fix it, much less even understanding what\u2019s going on.\n\nAgain I must stress: this is my interpretation of what I read in the OP.\n\nhttps://health.clevelandclinic.org/covert-narcissism/amp/", "Makes sense.

It\u2019s such bizarre, dysfunctional, mean-spirited behavior that I  think your wife might be the scapegoat of her family. That would mean that she was always celebrated less (or not at all) compared to her siblings or cousins. That could explain why she wanted a surprise party and envisioned people at it etc. Her behavior does seem child-like but if she\u2019s been the scapegoat since she was a child that could explain it. \n\nOf course she could have been the most celebrated child and she feels entitled to be celebrated but it\u2019s really unusual for families to turn against the golden child\u2026those dynamics tend to be really entrenched.", "Your wife is very immature for blaming you for the low attendance.

And yes YTA for putting your guests through that.", "Lol I had dinner with two friends recently for my birthday\ud83e\ude77. \n\nA third got me a lil hair pin. \n\nI feel very loved \ud83d\ude0d", "Look, I get feeling hurt if a bunch of people you thought would show up didn't, especially if she found out about the scheduling of the other party, which seems pretty deliberate. Running out on the guests who did come and getting mad at the person who planned the party is definitely not the way to handle that. NTA and I hope once she has the time to think about it she apologizes to you and the other guests. If my SO got 15 people to come to a surprise party for me, I'd be honored.", "How exactly does one ASK for their *own* SURPRISE party? Hmmm.\n\nNTA.\n\nShe was behaving like a petulant child and a spoiled brat... especially when it doesn't sound like you could afford it at the moment.", "NTA.  I would remove those extended family members from my life (the other party throwers). Zero tolerance for shit like that; cut them off entirely.\n\nI don\u2019t even blame your wife; sometimes birthdays are just sad as we get older. She should at least be grateful though.", "NTA, and the fact that after her ridiculous behavior your wife claims that **you** \"messed up big time\" moves her from immaturity territory to full-blown A H territory.", "NTA. Judging from your wife reactions/demands, I get why people chose to skip her \u201csurprise\u201d party. She\u2019s sounds like a bratty 5 year old", "Your wife is incredibly childish and rude. Crying and then literally driving home is ridiculous. She was blatantly rude to the guests who are there,\ufffc", "I always wonder how there can be grown ass adults that clearly have never experienced an actual trauma.  Like she burst into tears and didn't come back?  Life is HARD, how does anyone reach adulthood where this would even be a blip on the radar?\n\nYou are NTA", "Your wife was incredibly childish & rude. Crying & then literally driving home is ridiculous. She was blatantly rude to the guests who were there. 6-year-olds know not to behave like that. It\u2019s outrageous that an adult would behave that way. \n\nAnd she was horrible to you. You did not \u201cmess up big time.\u201d You did a lovely thing for her. You are NTA. But she is. A very ungrateful & self-absorbed one.", "NTA but I'm intrigued by this other family member that threw a competing party at the same time. What's up with that?  I have a feeling there's a lot more to this.", "NTA. You attempted to give your wife a lovely surprise party. The real AH of the story is the extended family that planned a party for the same night. The question is why. Were they not invited to your wife's party and acted petty? Do they have an issue with your wife? And for everyone to ditch out on your wife's party for the other one indicates extended family member has great influence or the issue might be closer to home. \n\nHave her siblings been able to give you an idea of what is behind this sudden party?", "NTA. It was not even a surprise party. You cannot ask for a surprise party. Anyway, I'm sorry there weren't many people there but on the other hand a birthday party is not a priority for people.", "Tell her about the family asshole who stole her thunder on purpose to ruin this for her.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your wife poo pooed on the 15 people who showed up to celebrate her. Do you think they will ever waste their time like this again?  If this is how your wife treats people, then it would explain the attendance.", ">Several key people cancelled at the last minute, and another person from her extended family scheduled a different family party in the same city at the same time and invited many of the same people (and refused my invitation/suggestion to join parties). This second party was thrown together in the last week while our party had been planned for four months.\n\nYou are NTA but that family member certainly is...", "NTA. What an entitled asshole, it's not the perfect party, who cares, you simply turn around walk out and blame everyone.\n\nIf a lot of people didn't come and many of the same people immediately changed to another party, combined with the way she reacted to people who spent time and money making a party for her, implies why so few people showed up. Your wife sounds like a bit of an ass and her family and friends have her as a low priority as a response. The people who helped with the party and saw her reaction will probably move her another notch lower after this.", "NTA your wife is beyond rude! I feel bad for the guests that did attend. I am not sure how you screwed up. You invited people who cancelled or didn\u2019t show you can\u2019t help that. Nor can you help that her family member planned a party for the same time knowing hers had be planned for months.", "The wife's reaction was terrible, but the assholes of the story  were definitely the family member who decided to throw a party the same day and the people who canceled.\n\nThere has to be a backstory here because throwing a party the same day as someone, that's just a d**k move straight out of a teenage movie. Also it's poor form to accept an invitation and at the last minute decline because something better came up. \n\nOP did everything he could, his wife should've just been happy to celebrate with the people who truly cared. I would've been sympathetic because it does sting/hurt to think that you have a lot of friends/family who care only to see most of them not show up for you, so I can give her a slight reprieve for her initial reaction but when she blamed her husband who put it so much effort she crossed into ah territory. \n\nNext time put on a smile and enjoy with the people who showed up then later have a cry at home about being embarrassed and fake friends. They could've commiserated together about how husband threw a lovely party and everyone missed out and sucked for not coming.\n\nNTA", "I don't even have 15 close friends that could be invited.\n\nMy surprise party, should it ever happen, would be \"big\" if there were six people besides my husband,  kids and MIL\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "As somebody whose birthday hasn't been a huge deal for years (my family is pretty much the \"odd one out\" when it comes to extended family. We're always depended on when Grandma needs some errands run or something, and we're always expected to attend everybody's parties, but none of them want to do anything for us or have parties with us), I'd be so thrilled to have just a few of my buddies do something cool with me on my birthday, even if it's just ordering pizza and putting on one of my favorite movies to watch with me.", "I see what you did there with 'surprise' ; )", "My wife indicated that she wanted a party but she wanted me to do all the work,... there I fixed it.", "Honestly, maybe I'm abnormal, but I can't identify with anyone over 18 being so invested in their birthday. Seems like it's something people throwing the party get more out of than the person being celebrated.  To me, birthday parties are for kids.", "Yep, there's more going on here. The date of this second party was completely intentional.", "> The wife's reaction was terrible, but the assholes of the story were definitely the family member who decided to throw a party the same day and the people who canceled.\n\nDebateable, that people switched kind of implies a lot of these people already have a problem with the wife. For all we know the wife asked for a surprise party on a day other than her birthday and picked a night of someone else's birthday deliberately.", "Nah that\u2019s not fair. She may have reacted poorly, but there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with someone expressing a desire to have a surprise party thrown for  them.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d never consider throwing a surprise party for someone who DIDNT express a desire for one.", "I\u2019d be heading over to the other party after the spoiled brat/birthday girl cried and left because her party was too small.", "It was probably just to take pics on socials.", "OP should have gotten his wife a mirror as a gift since that seems to be her main focus. What a peach", "Me too. You're not alone.", "It\u2019s not a surprise party if you ask for it. There is nothing wrong with asking for your spouse to throw you a party. But it is absurd to pretend it is a surprise.", "Sadly true.", "Funny that you should ask! OP felt the hair on his neck stand up the whole time, but it was a warm day? Super weird."]}
