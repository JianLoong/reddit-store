You were put in a bad situation by those people who threw competing party at the same time. I wonder if that was done on purpose, but surely a dick move. If you'd cancelled *maybe* more people would have attended. But let's be honest - some of them chose the other party which was announced later. You don't do that if you really like the person whose party you accepted first. \n\n\nThe reaction of your wife was truely horrible.

She didn't care about the friends being there to celebrate her, just for the numbers of people there? What shallow bullshit is this?", "NTA. \n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say the invitees skipped out because your wife is simply unlikable and that her reaction is an accurate representation of her personality a a whole.", "NTA. How is it your fault people didn't show up? Her reaction certainly doesn't show any appreciation for the people who did attend.", "NTA.  \n\nThe family member that knew of your plans and put together a last-minute event is though.  That seems really deliberate.\n\nThere is no way this is your fault.\n\nAlso, your wife's reaction was a bit over the top: she still had a party, just not as big as she wanted.  Crying and leaving because of the low turnout instead of being appreciative that you threw a party and people came is not very mature.", "NTA. Hold on...she envisioned the people at her 'suprise party'???\n\nLow attendance is for a reason. If that's her attitude I'm not 'surprised'\n\nYou went through all that trouble to pay for all that when you couldn't afford it and her first thought was 'me me me'??? Wow", "NTA- your wife is being ungrateful and sounds like a whiny child.", "NTA.\nBut your wife, regardless of how hurt she is, definite TA here.", "Ok, maybe it\u2019s me, but I think I would be quite happy if 15 of my dearest friends showed up for my birthday party. \n\nYour wife insulted the people who did show up like they weren\u2019t the good enough people.\n\nYou are NTA but your wife owes 15 people a very deep and sincere apology.", ">My wife indicated to me that she wanted a surprise birthday party. \n\nIf she knows about it, it isn't a surprise...", "NTA. Rookie mistake, you should have married an adult.", "NTA. How did you mess up? You went and did exactly what she asked. It\u2019s not your fault other people decided not to come in the end.

Im not surprise people went to the other party.", "NTA Your wife is being unreasonable and ungrateful. It's not a surprise party if she expects or asks for it, that;s just saying she wants a celebration but wants to forward the effort and cost of organizing it over to you.\n\nIf you're going through economic hardship, it's up to her to match her expectations to the reality she's in at the time.\n\nYou didn't mess up.

She gave a fuck that 15 people took the evening off to show up to her party. That OP did everything to make this party possible even though they don\u2019t have so much money right now. I bet every one at the party, even OP wished that they choosed the other party.", "Nta. I\u2019m curious why the AH family member had to throw a party on the same day at the same time?

It also sounds like maybe your wife's family may not like her too much if someone decided to throw a party at the same time after you already sent out invites.

The only reason I\u2019m saying NAH for now is that I wonder if the wife\u2019s family have a history of doing this and maybe she was just disappointed that it happened again, however that is purely speculation.

You invited a bunch of people and they couldn't come, why is she disappointed and hurt at *you* like *you* canceled on these people?\n\nWere you supposed to drag people to the party? Threaten them? Emotionally blackmail them? Make a pact with the devil to make sure they did attend?\n\nThat's insane, you sent out invitations, not summons.

If my husband got me a cake and invited 5 of my friends over to the house to celebrate my birthday I would be over the moon... If he planned an entire party and rented a space... I can't even imagine it. The fact that she's upset about things you had no control over (the attendance of the guests) makes me feel like she cares more about quantity than quality.

That or she has family and/ or friends who really hate her to schedule a party for the same date and time, in which case you and your wife have my sympathy.\n\nHowever, you and the other 15 people who showed up are NTA. Your wife's reaction and everyone else in this story are the AHs. Extra mega AH points to the malicious person planning a party for the same date and time when they knew better. As for the other people that didn't show up because they went to tacky party, cut them off. It's extremely rude to make plans and cancel like that. It would be one thing if they had to cancel due to some emergency or something that literally prevented them from being there (those people are also not AHs) but to cancel to go to another party. No, eff you, that tack AF.", "I totally get why people ditched to go to the last minute party. Who the heck would want to celebrate someone who asks for a surprise party?", "You nailed it!

Yes, the people that decided to go to the last min party probably didn't like your wife, honestly, I don't like her either.

She totally disrespected the guests that came, and left her husband in a really awkward situation.", "How is this indicative of covert narcissism? (Genuine, non-challenging question. Just interested in understanding.)", "Gotta agree with this. \n\nBad attitude. Odd family.", "Right?  The self absorption of wife is unreal.", "I wonder what their wedding was like", "So, this is my unwashed opinion and I could be very wrong, but this is how I\u2019m reading it.\n\nThe covert narcissist is different from the standard narcissist. The covert narcissist is deeply insecure and lashes out at others when their fragile ego is challenged. They also need to constantly be made to feel extremely special to compensate for their insecurity. When that doesn\u2019t happen, they blame everyone else around them. In their world things don\u2019t just happen, others are to blame. Then they challenge the reality of the situation by trying hard to convince the other person that the covert narcissist\u2019s view of the world is accurate. They are extremely good at gaslighting, and that is very abusive to the other person in the relationship.\n\nTo me this read very much like that type of situation: Fragile ego, not enough attention/attendance at the party, leaves to have pity party and the poor significant other believes that it\u2019s at least partly their fault and is distraught because they don\u2019t know what to do to fix it, much less even understanding what\u2019s going on.\n\nAgain I must stress: this is my interpretation of what I read in the OP.\n\nhttps://health.clevelandclinic.org/covert-narcissism/amp/", "Makes sense.
