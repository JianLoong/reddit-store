I personally, didn't attend both if a friend or family member was having both. Then when my sister and best friend (the people planning the shower) told me that a lot of the people who I wanted to come to my baby shower were going to make it for understandable reasons I decided to have a gender reveal party at a date that better suited the people who wanted to come celebrate my pregnancy but couldn't. \n\nMy husband was with this so we hosted it together at our backyard, nothing too fancy, people placing bets on what they thought the gender would be, a pink or blue dress code, a text/DM invite, and I made it explicitly clear that gifts were optional for this. I also thought that it would be really cute and fun to have mocktails in either pink or blue colors. I told people who were invited to pick which mocktail they wanted so I'd know how much to make plus a few extra. \n\nNow, to be fair, I didn't say that these drinks were mocktails but for both my gender reveal and baby shower I made it clear that I didn't want alcohol to served so I thought there was an understanding. Everyone who was invited came and I was so happy and we had a nice time. That was until Ted (45m) my cousin Jane's (32f) fianc\u00e9 started complaining about how \"weak\" his blue drink was and drank all the extra ones so he could feel a buzz that was never going to come. When it was explained to him that this was an alcohol free party he complained, left and then came back with a few cases of beer and shouted about how this party was saved. \n\nI thought that this was completely inappropriate and said something immediately and then Ted snapped back that it was completely controlling of me to demand that no one else drink just because I chose not to. My husband confronted him by saying that this was our house and if we didn't want alcohol in our home then there would be no alcohol. Ted started laughing and calling my husband whipped and no one was going to tell him what he could and couldn't drink. My husband and SIL then proceeded to pick up two of the cases that Ted had brought and tossed them out to the sidewalk. \n\nJane apologized and then left with Ted who then proceeded to send me messages about how much of a controlled witch with a b who wants the world to cater to me just because I'm pregnant and that I'm no one special. Right now I am definitely that extra sensitive pregnant woman even when I don't want to be and I know my family and friends love me too much to say anything while I've got my daughter inside me so to the strangers on Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1673192662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106m8s8/aita_for_wanting_mocktails_at_my_gender_reveal/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Either way I\u2019d just keep that in perspective for future events, and be much clearer about it being dry.\n\nThat being said, it is your house, your rules; and Ted should\u2019ve dropped the subject immediately.

But I'm feeling nice today. \n\nI want to be clear about something, since you seem genuinely concerned (at least enough to be asking strangers if you're an AH): literally NONE of this is about you being \"controlling\" or  even about the fact that you cannot drink because you're pregnant. You were having a BABY PARTY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON. While I suppose it wouldn't be inappropriate to have cocktails available IF you'd wanted to, or some champagne for a toast . . . honestly, WHO NEEDS ALCOHOL AT A PARTY CELEBRATING A BABY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON? Like, just the fact that Ted is acting like you did something weird or wrong is . . . super weird. \n\nWhen I think of a gender reveal or a baby shower I think of iced tea or lemonade for the guests, maybe some fizzy drinks (soda/pop, whatever you call it where you live), coffee and tea if you live where it's wintery or to go with desserts. I don't think of . . . beer? Or even really of wine or cocktails. \n\nYou are so much NTA, but Ted was so extraordinarily, deeply inappropriate, not only in his behaviour generally, but in his weird suggestion that people can't enjoy themselves unless they're tying one on. Most healthy adults have, you know, personalities. They can enjoy each other's company without needing to get tipsy. Ted needs rehab, and therapy. And again, you are 100% NTA.", "Gender reveal parties make everyone involved assholes.

But a baby shower/gender reveal doesn't scream rager to me.", "Yeah, that makes him look much worse. But I will ding you points for having a dress code. Nothing more annoying than having to find something in a particular color to wear.", "As a woman, I'm so incredibly glad to live in a country where this stuff is not a thing. Nor engagements, engagement parties, rehearsal dinners, bridal showers, or any other money-spending expedient that undoubtedly exists but I blessedly ignore.", "Agreed; I find the whole gender reveal/baby shower thing tedious and obnoxious.", "I'm with you on that. My baby shower lasted maybe an hour and a half at most and I was ready to leave half an hour into it.", "It was a three hour event with friends and family, how exhausting can that be? \ud83d\ude44", "I didn't say we're serving cocktails. I showed two pictures of different drinks that were pink or blue mocktails.", "It's almost like some guests forget that the event is not about them!", "It is possible to feel sorry for people who are making a poor decision.", "Haha Jane still has time to escape. I'd be pretty ashamed if I were Jane.", "Agreed. I thought baby showers were bad, but gender reveals are even worse.", "Didn\u2019t you also say that you didn\u2019t go to many of these events in the past? So some of those people maybe just not wanting to go for whatever reason (including that you skipped theirs) and you made that harder by saying \u201cwe\u2019re having a second party, just so you can attend since you couldn\u2019t make the 1st one\u201d \n\nAnd every baby shower I\u2019ve been to that had a \u201cno gifts required\u201d note, would still have a gift table, time set aside for opening them in front of everyone and some side eye for anyone who showed up empty handed. lol it\u2019s a social contract. Very few people are going to a baby shower (or a make up baby shower disguised as a gender review) without a gift.", "Just don't have a second party.  IF they couldn't make it, they couldn't make it.  What if some people can't make it to the second, will you have  3rd?  Not everyone can make a party and some will conveniently find a reason why they were busy just to avoid it.  1 is enough.", "I mean you had a dress code for gendered colors, kinda cringe imo but whatever. I don\u2019t see the need for a second party if you say you\u2019re against gender reveal parties? Sometimes people can\u2019t come to events. If you wanted to have a gender reveal party just say that lol", "You don't really need to explain why you had one to these folks. That's not really a material part of the question IMHO.", "Then have a party for no reason, not to celebrate baby genitals. It is the second grossest party people have centered around baby genitals", "Honey, you are not an asshole. That old man is. Anyone can have any party they wish. The people you invited couldn't make your baby shower, do you put on another party for them to come and celebrate. That was thoughtful.  Doesn't matter what the party was, if it was another baby shower people would call you greedy. How you and you husband feel is all that matters.", "They can share but if you have a big family, it gets so exhausting with a party for everything.  you lose time for your whole family.  What was wrong with a phone call or a big zoom call?  I loved covid because I had more time with immediate family.", "So you do have the 'if I can't drink, no one else can' mentality.", "Same, alcohol free home and dry wedding, of course the wedding was also around 10 am so most shouldnt feel the need to get drunk that early (we had recovering alcoholics and closeted ones). Though ironically a member of the wedding party made some potion looking bottles for decoration that contained alcohol and was instructed to not reveal until later -backyard wedding at parents home. My mom still tells me it was her favorite wedding out me and 2 of my sisters.", "Yeah, daytime child related event is different than nighttime party as far as alcohol goes. The last baby shower I went to actually had some booze, sangria or something, and almost no one touched it. They had to run errands or pick up their kids and shit.", "The dress code was more of a suggestion and wearing something as simple a pink wrist band or a blue hat would've satisfied the requirement.", "So NTA. If Ted can\u2019t make it through a gender reveal party without getting cranked,", " Not everyone can make a party and some will conveniently find a reason why they were busy just to avoid it.", "Extremely. As an introverted person I can only spend so much time around people I like before I need to recharge.", "Did they look like alcoholic drinks though?  Was there wording that they would be mocktails or alcoholic free?  If you stated that, NTA.", "But did you specify these were mocktails? The way you state this sounds like you were intentionally misleading them, and us. NTA and Ted is a huge alcoholic A-H, but don\u2019t be duplicitous.", "If they looked like cocktails and you asking how many people want before they even show up, your kinda being deceitful. I would have assumed there was alcohol in them as well. \n\nIt makes sense a pregnant person doesn\u2019t want to load up on a bunch of booze/have to worry about what to do with the extra since they can\u2019t drink themselves, and it\u2019s more expensive than typical drink ingredients. So getting a estimate of how much you may need makes sense. \n\nDoing the same for mocktails (when there\u2019s only two options) makes less sense to me. Did you ask how many of any other food/drink item at the party people thought they may want?", "If you don't want to make your guests comfortable and have a good time then don't throw a party.", "So everyone sucks because you don't like gender reveal parties?", "Everyone who said that they couldn't make it to the baby shower were at the gender reveal party. The baby shower is next and if the people who said that they could make it to that but end up not showing, then that's on them because I tried to accommodate everyone who wanted to be apart of the celebration.", "If you need someone to throw you a party so you'll feel better, I'll help. \n\nPeople can throw a party for whatever reason they like.", "Most of the people who said they couldn't make it, expressed being sad about it and asked if it was possible to change the date. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a date that worked for everyone hence the small (nearly and last minute) Gender Reveal party. My husband I and kept it simple and told people more than once that gifts were optional.", "How did I make sure I got gifts at a gender reveal party when I said that they were optional? I didn't say gifts were required nor did I bring up the fact that some people didn't even bring a gift.", "I don\u2019t have children. I\u2019ve never been to one. I wouldn\u2019t have one because I don\u2019t see the need to. But unlike your bitter ass, I\u2019m sure as hell not going to berate and judge someone for having such a party. Lavish weddings, bridal / baby showers are ok, but god forbid someone shares news with their closest friends and families whether they\u2019re having a boy or a girl? My god how miserable do you have to be for that to offend you?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Stop judging people for what they chose to celebrate or not. You want to zoom call to tell your family shit? Totally fine. Op wanted a party. Also fine.", "Exhausting for who? If you don\u2019t want to go don\u2019t go.", "If you hate strawberries, would you get a strawberry cake for your birthday because other people asked for it?", "I mean, same. But I don't use alcohol as a crutch to get through it, and I don't think parties need alcohol to be fun. In fact, as an introverted person, I find dry parties far less exhausting than parties where the fun is booze.", "Then you leave though.  You don't be obnoxious like Ted at any event.", "I'm sorry, are you implying that if this was a misunderstanding due to the picture that this behavior is ok? If you are SO disappointed by the lack of alcohol that you behave like this, you have a problem. I don't care what you thought was going to be provided.\n\nWhat she should have stated was that the party was alcoholic free. Then Ted wouldn't have been there.", "in the post she clearly stated beforehand she didn\u2019t want alcohol served at either event so anyone who showed up consented to that. if ted didn\u2019t know it\u2019s cause the cousin didn\u2019t tell him", "You're not at all required to attend these -- you do know that, right?", "I tagged after the other comments because I agreed with their ESH reasoning.  I also agree about GRP as being self absorbed, and stupid.", "Maybe they just said they couldn\u2019t make it because they didn\u2019t want to come", "Even that's gross.  Saying gifts are optional rather than just saying no gifts please.  Some people like close family are going to feel like they have to bring gifts to a gender reveal and then the baby shower.", "Some people actually like their families and some family members actually like celebrating with a party because they also like their family.", "Username checks out at least.", "That kind of says though that she's expecting some gifts.  No gifts please would be clear that it's not about gifts.", "You\u2019re working really hard to defend the OP all over this post but by her own admission, she was one of these judgmental people a few short months ago.", "Where did I say she shouldn't have one, if she wants one, she wants one.  But this is also a \"second shower\" she said because not enough people came to the first.   We're perfectly fine saying nope, can't travel 2 hours each way.    Sharing a viewpoint and that a party isn't the only option and ,my experience is not judging.  Look up the definition of judgement.", "That's not the same at all.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing about the alcohol situation. I\u2019m disagreeing with the dismissive statement about friends not being exhausting.", "No shit", "Ok, but if she also included pictures of what drinks that look alcoholic without specifying they were actually mocktails, then that's confusing. It's mixed messages, so it's not surprising someone made the wrong assumption. I mean, Ted's still an AH for his behavior afterwards, but it sounds like OP could have been more clear with the invitations.", "It reads like she made it clear to the people throwing the party for her, not the guests. \n\nIf she sent out quantity requests for any other food/drink, I\u2019ll give the benefit of doubt to OP that this maybe the confusion was not intentional. Otherwise I don\u2019t buy it. That was a lure just like the second party was a gift grab. Yeah you can write \u201cno gifts required\u201d, but social contract is to bring gifts to baby events like these, especially if you can\u2019t make the baby shower.", "Not really the point... She flat out said she didn't tell people that these were mocktails. She also said she didn't want alchohol at the parties, but didn't specify how she let her guests know it was going to be a dry event... Was it even on the invite? Sure your reason for having a party is yours. But the biggest part of hosting something is making your guests happy and taken care of.", "So what?? People can\u2019t change their minds about something? News flash, people tend to be hypocrites at times. Maybe OP didn\u2019t care for them before, but now that she\u2019s having kids of her own, her opinion changed.", "They can. I was just suggesting that you don\u2019t have to White Knight quite so hard particularly because from OP\u2019s comments, I believe she thinks that she has a Good Reason to have a party while everyone else that has a gender reveal is weird and selfish.", "Didn\u2019t think I was being a white knight. I personally don\u2019t care if OP has a gender reveal party. I myself wouldn\u2019t have on, but not because I\u2019m against them, simply because I feel a text message would suffice. I\u2019m against people being against gender reveals. No one can dictate what people chose to celebrate."]}
