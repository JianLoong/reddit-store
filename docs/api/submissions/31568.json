Not only did you go back on your word to watch the pup until he had a place that allowed pets, but the fact you couldn\u2019t even talk to him as an adult is manipulative and childish.", "YTA, I see why he was an unhappy child.", "YTA.\n\nYou bonded with the dog - but so did he. \n\nShe was his, and he didn't leave her behind out of neglect or not wanting her, he couldn't find a suitable place for her. Could he have tried harder at that? Maybe, I'm not sure of how easy or difficult that would have been. However it doesn't change the fact that you should have let him take his dog when he was able to do so. \n\nYour response was quite manipulative, albeit maybe unintentionally so. You should have spoken about it again when you felt calmer. I believe your son could have been more open about how he really felt, but this is fairly black and white. The dog was his, freely given by you, and you should have considered the impact of keeping her on him, not just how you felt. He will never get that time back with the dog, and that will always hurt him.", "INFO: How often did your son visit and interact with the dog while he lived elsewhere?\n\nYour initial reaction of not wanting to give up the dog is understandable, and that's probably why he so quickly gave up on trying to get the dog back. But that does't mean it was necessarily ok with him -- he probably was trying to be nice and/or avoid a fight. Once you had time to get over your emotional reaction, you should have talked to him about the situation.\n\nAs long as he hadn't done anything that felt like abandoning the dog, you should have made an effort to give the dog back to him. That was the agreement you previously made, after all.", "YTA\n\nIt was his dog. You agreed to look after it because he couldn't, you were doing him a favour but it was his dog.\n\nAnd when the time came you couldn't even have an adult conversation about it.", "YTA. It was his dog, he loved her and you took her away from him.", "YTA, my cat is my emotional support animal and if my parents wouldn\u2019t let me take him when I left their house I\u2019d be livid. You were being selfish and immature by placing your feelings and bond with the dog over his feelings and your agreement.", "YTA. It was his dog. You agreed to foster it until he could sort something better out, and you then decided your feelings mattered more.", "Honestly, yes, YWTA. It was your son's dog. You bought it for him, later, you agreed to take care of it until he had suitable accommodation, then when he did, you reneged on your promise. I understand that he did say they would get another dog but I think you could, and should, have taken a bit of time after that initial conversation. Ideally at that point you could have gone back to him and said something like \"It was a bit of a shock when you said you wanted to take \\[dog\\] as we've got so used to him and so close to him, but I wanted to check if you were really OK with us keeping him and you getting another dog, or if you said that becasue you could see I was upset. IF you want to take him, of course you can, he's your dog, and we'll still see him when you or we visit\" \n\nI think by holding him to something what was clearly him reacting to you being upset, you did take advantage and \n\nI understand you were attached to the dog too, and also that it's now too late to change things, but at the very least, I think you need to apologise to him and acknowledge that you should have let him have his dog back or at the very least, have checked back with him once you'd both had the chance to absorb the idea - you that he wanted the dog back and him that you wanted to keep it. Even if you were objectively right, it's clearly been weighing on him for a long time and an open and sincere apology could go a very long way towards meaning the relationship with him. Sometimes it is more importnat to be kind than to be right, and this is one of those times.", "YTA. Why would you do that to your child? My kid just left for college leaving behind a dog and bunny. We talked extensively ahead of time to be on the same page. I\u2019m taking care of them like my own, but they are not my pets. I\u2019m caring for them because my child loves them and has every intention of taking care of them in the future. I spare no measure of care, effort, love, attention and funds.  But when my kid is ready to to provide a home for them, you best believe they will leave with my kid.", "Yeah, I'm leaning YTA. You knew he would want his dog to live with him and instead of being gracious, you weaponized your emotions to blackmail your own son into leaving his dog with you. I'd be resentful too.", "Gently... YTA. I was your kid and I left my dog with my parents when I went to college. I'd rescued her from a horrible situation and begged them to let me have her, and eventually they did. My plan was to spend 1-2 years in college and then send for her, with my parents agreement. However, during that time, my parents bonded really hard with my dog, especially my mom who at that point had cancer. I was originally going to use my dog for search-and-rescue, but decided my parents could give her an amazing life and let them keep her. It was always hard to visit her, but it was a good decision for everyone. I ended up adopting my soul dog who I never would have met otherwise. However, it was a mutual decision. I would have felt really bitter towards my parents if we hadn't sat down and had an honest conversation about it. Your son should have spoken up more early on and you owed him a better conversation. I think you owe him an apology, but that doesn't necessary make you a horrific AH. You failed to communicate and took your kid's dog.", "YTA. It\u2019s his dog.", "YTA. \nSo if I'm getting the timeline right, your son, fresh out of college in the mid 2000s as austerity and recession are maxxing, manages to save enough money (in that economy?!?!?) to buy a house within two years (again: in THAT  economy?!?!?) presumably by living in kinda crappy apartments (y'know, because of *that* economy) and is ready to get the dog a house of its own! with two adults! And instead of being proud of and happy for your son for pulling off such an accomplishment in THAT economy, you keep his dog. :( \n\nYTA, again, when you didn't even think to sit down, talk about it, find a new pet maybe?? and instead just hand waved yr kid away. \n\n\ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\ude44 remember this when its time for hospice, old man", "Jesus, YTA\n\nIt was HIS dog. He had just moved out and didn't have a pet friendly environment for a couple of years and asked you to watch them.\n\nThen when he did, you refused? Screw that, I would have taken MY dog. He didn't abandon the pet.\n\nHe's right to be resentful and angry with you. That was 10 years they were meant to have together", "Boomer wonders why their child won't vist them.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t know why he was unhappy? The narcissism is real.", "YTA. The dog story just by itself would have me torn but the fact that you say your son was an unhappy child and you never knew why when it has no bearing on the story besides making him sound unreasonably emotional makes me think you tend to be a manipulative person.", "YTA. No wonder your son was an unhappy child. It's because he had a selfish asshole like you as a parent. Your son loved that dog too, and it was HIS DOG. But you showed him that you don't care about his feelings at all. All you care about is what you want. You're so nasty and selfish. And he was unhappy throughout his child but you didn't change how you treated him; I sense missing reasons that you've conveniently left out of the post. You're clearly not a good parent since your son was so unhappy for years and then you made him even more unhappy by refusing to give him back his dog.", "*He said he wasn't sure if he would be able to find somewhere dog-friendly and asked if* ***we would be willing to look after her until*** *he had somewhere sorted.* ***We told him we would***, and to ***let us know when he was able to take her***.\n\n.....\n\n***I don't think I did or said the wrong thing,*** *but my son is increasingly distant now.*\n\nYTA.

I made compromises so I could have a place where I could keep my dog. If it was his dog he\u2019d have taken her with him when he moved out regardless. Turns out despite buying the dog for him it wasn\u2019t actually his dog and this is a learning experience for him on what proper pet ownership is all about.", "NTA.\n\nI'm actually surprised at the number of people calling you out for this. It's pretty simple, you cared for the dog in his absence for years. You bonded with the dog and the dog bonded with you, without him.\n\nMany teenagers who become adults have to go through this exact thing, including me. The difference being I did not want my dog to be ripped from the only home he's ever known.\n\nYour son should be able to look back at this point in their 40's and rationalize the decision and not hold any resentment.", "I had a younger dog when I moved out of my folks house. Since I was working 12+ hours at times and him being used to being around my folks and their dogs, the decision was made for him to live with them. \n\nIt took 3 years for my life to stabilize enough to have him with me.

I can understand and sympathize with your emotional attachment to the dog, leading you to break your promise to your son. However, your subsequent reaction turned you into an AH. You couldn't even communicate with him to express your thoughts; instead, you started crying and refused to speak. From my perspective, this is a significant emotional manipulation tactic, making me question whether you've always been adept at using emotions to make him feel guilty and comply with your wishes, especially when combined with your statement that your son is never happy.", "NTA. It was a few YEARS people. If he\u2019d prioritized the dog, I\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve found a living situation in order to get it back. But he didn\u2019t. And it lived in the house for so long it\u2019s basically a family dog. \n\nThat said, I understand his resentment.

It was completely his, but he let you use it from time to time for errands. Imagine if, after college, he moves to an apartment without a parking space, so he leaves it at your place and continues to let you use it. Now that he has a home with a parking space, he wants to use his car again. It doesn't really matter whether you liked the car, be it the convenience, or it's comfortable, or fun to drive; it was never yours to begin with. Just because you bonded with his dog and looked after it, doesn't mean it was yours.", "NAH. This isn\u2019t about the dog. This is about trust and your son not feeling like your priority. This was a long time ago so there\u2019s nothing you could do to change it anyway. I think your son is just after a heartfelt apology. Not \u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt that way\u201d. Not \u201cI\u2019m sorry but you were always such a sensitive kid\u201d. Just \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to have hurt you.

My friend's sister was in a similar situation, both her and her parents really love the dog she brought, but she moved out and couldn't take him with her, so he stayed with her parents until she found a dog friendly apartment. By that time, her parents really bonded with her dog, and since the dog really loved all of them, they decided to share him - she has him for like a week, then her parents have him, or they take him out to their cabin, since he can run around there as much as he wants. Basically a shared cistody of a dog, and that little doggie loves it.", "NTA. The dog had lived most of her life with you as primary caretakers and him as an infrequent visitor.

It was hard, and he often spent a week at my parents\u2019 house because they loved him too, but I never abandoned him so I could buy a house. He was with me every step of the way until I bought a house ten years later, and a few more after that. \n\nIf your son was that concerned about the dog, he would\u2019ve have moved out without taking the dog with him.

If ever my younger brother would want to take him away, he'd have to ensure his quality of life would not be negatively impacted. For that, he's got to make sure not to just have the basics, but to also have access to love and people to care for the dog. Moving this dog out from a multi-family home over to a single or two-person would assure a quick trip to depress the critter.\n\nIt's not just your son or your feelings that need to be taken into account.

Along the way, I had 3 different landlords tell me that I would have to move out if I wanted a dog. \n\nIn my case, I had to buy my own house before I could get a dog. \n\nIt sounds like it only took OP's son 2 or 3 years to get there.

He was devoted to that dog until he had to move out on his own, and then wanted him back as soon as he could.

He's ALSO an adult and should have addressed it in the 10 years between the initial request and the death of the dog.\n\nThird of all, both of you suck because neither of you seemed to think about the welfare of the dog. Dogs have a hard time adjusting to new surroundings even if they are moving with their people. Maybe it might have been better that the dog stay with you, or maybe it would have done fine with your son.

You son doesn't get to leave the dog for 2 years or more and then come back claiming it's his. That's not how it works. \n\nAnd we also need to remember that dogs are not children.

What kind of melodramatic malarkey is that?!).  You told him to let you know when he was ready for her.  He had said he wanted to take the dog when he can swing an acceptable housing situation, so his intentions were clear, and you agreed.  \n\nSounds like he had to shut down his own needs to prioritize your feelings (tearing up in shock over something everyone had agreed was going to happen??

He should have said how deeply impactful this was, and you could have been presented an option to take that into consideration, but it sounds like it didn't happen.  No one did anything \"wrong\" here, it was just a poor outcome from a lack of communication.\n\nIf you can honestly say that you'd have let him take the dog with him, had he explained these things at the time, then truly you have nothing else to apologize for.
