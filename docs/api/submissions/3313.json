My comment stands.", "It sounds like the aunt is not close to the family and seized on a way to create drama from the connection.", ">because she crazy attention and caughtly the comes with being one!\n\nHit the nail on the head. Take my upvote.", "Thank you. If you were so triggered that even mentioning it was too hard, you doubt there'd be a Public Memorial and Statue about it. It isn't just a gravestone we're talking about.", "OK, OP didn't include in the post that the memorial was new. I see they added that information in comments. That changes things a bit.", "It wasn't \"her\" dead child.  It was a nibling whose immediate family had just announced the construction of the memorial.   The woman was overplaying here.", "What\u2019s the purpose of the memorial? Remembrance maybe? NTA", "NTA and the aunt is. If it's too painful for her to discuss then she should have said as much and been done with it. Going to the boss was way out of line.", "NTA - Dear OP - I wish more people would be like you!\n\nOne of the big side effects of grief and traumatic experiences is that people get afraid of it. They fear to say something wrong, they fear the awkwardness, they don't know what to say.... So they simply don't. They avoid you out of fear of doing something wrong, and you end up isolated and with noone to share memories, tears or hugs with.\n\nI'm a policeman, my wife's a trauma nurse. We have both dealt with many many people, who were sad, depressed, traumatised, grieving or a combination, and one of the most important things you can do, is dare to be there, dare to listen, let tears be tears and simply acknowledge that person and their grief, instead of pretending they don't exist.\n\nAll people are different. To the aunt your remark was an unwelcome reminder of her grief. For many others it would have been extremely heart warming. You did nothing wrong, and you had the best intentions.\n\nPlease don't change, you can make a big difference for someone else in the future.", "You essentially told her your intention to pay respects. I can't think of any culture where that's disrespectful ?maybe someone else can clarify that, but it's obviously well intentioned.\n\nThis NAH because you can't measure someone's grief as ever over. She could still be in a lot of pain and sometimes the work place isn't where some people can talk about stuff that ersonal. now you know don't ever ever bring it up with her.", "NTA\n\nJust the world we live in. Can't \"trigger\" people because they can't handle their emotions. Honestly idk how people like that get through the day being that soft.", "NTA.  There's really no winning here.  If you mention it, you could trigger her (but there's no way you could predict she would complain to your boss, which is ridiculous).  If you don't mention anything, she could complain that you're such a close friend of the family and don't even care to mention the loss.", "Jesus Christ \ud83d\ude44", "And posted it on their social media/online memorial. Frankly, they're looking for acknowledgement and want people to remember the child in a very public way.\n\nTheir actions are the very opposite of \"tiptoe around the subject\" and \"don't want it brought up because of grief\"", "That is by far the most ignorant thing I've ever read", "Yes, this. The nature of the business interaction may make personal comments inappropriate.", "Oops, I must have misread that part\u2026not sure how because it\u2019s so obvious now. Thanks!", "Of course I don't mention it at work. I contact them outside of work, or I wait until the end of the day when we're leaving. Of course I'm not going to drop that on them during their work day! They've got enough going on in their head and they're undoubtedly struggling enough to make it through the day as it is without me bringing it up in the middle of their work day. How heartless!", "That is not at all a comparable situation. It\u2019s unclear if OP is actually friends with the aunt (based on the fact that they would only see her at work, I think it\u2019s a no) or if the aunt had anything to do with the memorial (also feels like a no - I assume OP would mention if she was). If I was the aunt in this situation I would be extremely uncomfortable.", "I can see that this is really under your skin. Hope you can let it go. By the way, there's no mention of HR anywhere in the post.", "Why would you expect someone to be struggling through the day 2 years after her nibling passed?   To me, the heartless thing would be to ignore something the child's immediate family made such a big deal of.", "And the memorial was just recently put up. Which usually tends to bring up a fresh batch of grief in people.\n\nAnd you're welcome to assume that. But there are a hundred other reasons it could've upset her and the fact is, that's just an assumption.\n\nFor all we know, she could've been a godparent and the favorite aunt. She could've been watching him when he passed or it happened on her property/at her event. She could've been out of town and missed the funeral. Or a hundred different reasons.\n\nTo randomly assume that it's because she didn't feel like a real aunt??? When absolutely nothing indicates that??? Weird leap to make.", "But the memorial was recently erected and posted on social media!! None of this says it\u2019s too sensitive to discuss or mention. How can she not say to a family friend she felt bad about her mentioning it but went to her boss to do what?? Cause her trouble at work at worst to lose her job!?? NTA! Stay away from that lady.", "It\u2019s a sensitive topic that I\u2019d never mention in a public setting since I\u2019d expect the person might still be grieving heavily. I understand that others think it\u2019s NBD but I personally would never bring it up, especially at work.", ">For all we know, she could've been a godparent and the favorite aunt.\n\nWell we do know that none of that applied because the OP, who has known the family since before the child was born didn't mention it.  What she said was it was an aunt by marriage, implying that for whatever reason, she was *not* especially close to the child or family.   And she would also be in a position to know whether any of the other things you said would have applied.   \n\nYou seem to be particularly invested in creating scenario in which the aunt's behavior would have been understandable rather than what it was, totally unexpected.", "How was it unexpected? I genuinely cannot wrap my head around this. Her reaction seems completely normal to me!", "NTA.", "Totally NTA \u2026 I\u2019m sorry she went to your boss. I hope you didn\u2019t get in trouble", "NAH. I bet she didn't \"tell on you.\" Most likely scenario: you mentioned the beautiful memorial and that you'd like to visit it. She's good with that. Y'all go your separate ways. It's a memorial to a dead kid, to whom she was close, so obviously she cries. Someone sees her crying, tells boss, boss asks \"who are you crying? Are you okay?\" She says \"Oh, OP just mentioned the memorial and it made me cry.\" Not in any accusatory way, it's just why they're crying. Understandably. Either boss misinterprets it as OP trying to make them cry (doubtful), or boss doesn't want a crying person on the premises. So talks to OP.  Crying is fine. You lose someone close to you, especially a child, you don't get over it. You learn to live with it is all. And with time the good days start happening more frequently, and eventually you can think about the loved one and smile rather than completely losing your stuff. That takes a while.\n\nEveryone is right here. I see zero AHs. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Sending love to OP and the child's family. BTW OP, there is a memorial of my loved one. KIA. Still makes me cry, decade and a half later, when I'm asked about it. But it makes me HAPPY for people to ask. I am crying but I am GLAD when someone has seen it, because that means they're thinking about him. As long as he lives in someone's mind, he isn't gone. The more minds, the better. Yah you made her cry. Isn't necessarily a bad thing.", "I\u2019d like to hear the other side \u201cWhos family I\u2019ve known for over 25 years\u201d as friends? Or just know of? \n\nWhat industry does OP work in, was this conversation public and the aunt was trying not to make a scene? \n\nOP even says this isn\u2019t someone they\u2019d talk to outside of work setting, so while they might have meant well this was probably a very loaded topic.", "NTA - I assume that if family wants to post that stuff then they want comments and condolences etc. I don\u2019t even understand what she was hoping to have happen? Did she want you fired? Reprimanded? I lose sympathy real fast for people like this. We see posts where people get in trouble because someone was mad that no one congratulated them, gave them condolences or some of the form of recognition. We can\u2019t seem to win either way and we aren\u2019t mind readers. If they don\u2019t want comments or condolences then they shouldn\u2019t post stuff publicly or put things in public places where people will make comments and condolences. \n\nSecond, and I may be looked at as an asshole for saying this but I personally don\u2019t like seeing crosses and piles of teddy bears and other types of memorial stuff along the roadside or in public parks/places where somebody died. It\u2019s distracting and above all it\u2019s littering in my book. Most of it is never maintained and eventually looks awful. And before anyone says I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like, I do know. I lost my oldest sister when she was 17 in a car accident and we did not place anything at the accident site. Graveyards are meant for this kind of stuff. That\u2019s the whole point of a graveyard is to have a place to go to mourn your loved one. If everybody put statues and other crap places where people died at the roadside and other places (some being on private property which I doubt they got permission) our roads and parks would be littered with these. Where do we draw the line? I understand their pain but not everyone wants the countryside littered with reminders that someone died there.", "NTA.", "NTA. If the statue really triggers the aunt wouldn't she find a way to take it down???", "NTA They have created a physical, public memorial in a public place and made a public announcement. How then are the public to know that no public must mention their public displays? That is nonsensical.", "You come across as an incredibly cruel and callous person to so completely dismiss someone's grief over their deceased child as \"attention seeking\" and mock a memorial tattoo. I am hoping that you are not, but this comment comes across as entirely mean spirited.", "They she the aunt often at work, it's not like they hadn't seen her forever and this is the first thing that they said.", "But it's a public memorial? And the aunt wasn't a random coworker, OP had known the family for 25 years.", "I was thinking the same thing then saw your update and had to go back and re-read it as I missed it too.", "As the aunt, I don't think she had a say in how the parents memorialized *their* child.", "But did she even mention the child first? Like you could start this conversation with \"I heard about (Kid); I'm so sorry\" and then mention the memorial if the convo is going OK. It seems weird to lead with the statue being pretty.", "It most certainly is comparable.  The child's family publicized the construction of the memorial and the OP mentioned it to another family member.   In my world, it would have been extremely rude to *not* mention it.", "Did the aunt have anything to do with the memorial specifically? Does OP know aunt personally? If the answer to both is not yes than it seems completely bizarre to me.", "OP sees the woman daily.   And whether or not she had anything to do with the memorial, she sees  her [whatever you want to call it] to be seen as a reason to invalidate the family's wish to draw attention to the child's death through the memorial to the extent that she goes out of her way to complain to the boss.   That's what I would call bizarre indeed.", "You honestly think that it would be normal to for someone call up the boss and complain because someone mentioned that her extended family had erected a memorial their child (who died 2 years ago)?", "She might not have realized she was upset until later, and wasn't sure how to bring it up so chose to pass along a message. Being triggered by a death years after the fact is literally normal and it's incredibly cruel to refer to someone as a \"poor fragile delicate flower\" for not wanting to be blindsided by discussion of a dead relative.", "If I had an interaction at work that made me uncomfortable, and I wasn't sure what to do in the moment but later decided that I wanted to handle it, then yes! Telling a supervisor so the message can be passed on (OP wasn't in trouble, they were not punished) seems completely reasonable to me.", "NTA. My brother died last year. My hometown erected a memorial statue in his honor (we\u2019re from a small town and he was well loved). They received approval from my mother before commencing the process. We spoke at the unveiling. It was a very touching and sweet tribute. Sometimes people bring it up similar to the way you did because there was an article in the local newspaper. I couldn\u2019t imagine getting mad at that. I\u2019m certainly sad my brother died but I am so, so, so happy that so many people loved him so deeply that wish to continue to honor his memory in perpetuity.", "NAH in my opinion. I could totally see being the aunt in that scenario, nodding along at the time, being thrown off by the interaction, and saying to my manager \u201cI\u2019m sure OP meant well but I\u2019d rather not talk about this tragic death at work, do you mind passing that along?\u201d \n\nso, depends on the tone. OP you did nothing wrong though", "NTA! You are hurting too. It was a sympathetic gesture and a meaningful one to express how you felt about the statue. For her to contact your boss over something like this, makes her the AH. I get she's hurting, but to mess with your livelihood and possibly get you fired, is an AH move.", "As someone with a nephew that drowned at 2, almost 18 years ago, I appreciate any opportunity to ever speak of that sweet baby. It took a huge toll on me and it\u2019s nice to keep his memory alive. There\u2019s no way you could have known she wasn\u2019t open to speaking about it in a general way. \nNTA", "You approached her out of the blue at work to speak about this? YTA. Comment on the Facebook post. She probably wasn't expecting to be reminded of a tragedy that had 0 do with your work while she's trying to work. Time and place for everything and Facebook life should not intersect workplace life.", "NTA - it sounds like she has a personality disorder, so steer clear of her.", "Most people like it when a loved one is remembered.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss \u2764\ufe0f", "Or like, just be triggered and carry on. Not every upset you encounter in the day has to be addressed.", "Oh yes. Pointing out that a person only starts sobbing and lamenting when she has an opportunity to make more money from it. Yeah. Totally callous.", "They are posting it on the internet and then getting upset people talk about it? NTA", "NAH although close to Y T A. No real need to randomly bring it up with someone you don't know that well", "NTA", "Yeah it doesn't sound like OP got a \"strike\" on their record or anything, the aunt just didn't have the strength to have the conversation with OP and had the boss do it instead. Which I think is generally how these things play out. I guess she could've had a coworker do it instead but that dynamic could put the coworker in a weird spot if OP decided to shoot the messenger.", "Jesus, just an aunt?? I'd be quite upset about one of my nieces of nephews tragically dying. NAH in terms of OP", "Think it's reasonable enough. Bringing up dead family members is risky territory work wise", "It\u2019s NOT some hard to predict trigger, but this reaction is still baffling to me.\n\nI lost my daughter 7 years ago. People are more often than not afraid to mention her to me. They say they are afraid they\u2019ll remind me about her. As if I could my own child! I literally think about her every single day. \n\nNo, if anything, I\u2019m just freaking happy they remember her! I WANT people to mention her! If I had a memorial for my child, I would be thrilled and honored that someone asked about it and wanted to visit.\n\nThe fact that this is just an aunt who was \u201ctriggered\u2026\u201d I\u2019m almost want to say it\u2019s for one of two reasons - the aunt doesn\u2019t particularly like OP and was looking for a reason to get him/her in trouble. Or their aunt likes to be dramatic and wants to make kid\u2019s death all about her. Granted, I realize I\u2019m making some strong accusations knowing very little about this lady. But her reaction is very bizarre.\n\nEdited for auto correct", " \"Or there aunt likes to be dramatic and wants to make kid\u2019s death all about here.\"  \n\n\nThank you for explaining better than I could. This is my suspicion.  I've had similar behaviour on the part of someone, after my husband of 27 years died and this was my first thought.", "Oh my gosh, just now seeing my horrible autocorrects. Lol. Fixed now.\n\nBut yes, if the parents didn\u2019t want their child to be remembered and celebrated, they wouldn\u2019t have made a PHYSICAL PUBLIC MEMORIAL. The Aunt definitely has something else going on.", "Yeah I mean, call me crazy but isn't the whole point of a MEMORIAL to, you know... remember the person?", "But we should rise to the challenge.", "When did niblings get so downgraded? Especially now that most people only have about 2 kids", "Niblings haven't been downgraded.   The point was this aunt seems to be out of step with the immediate family, the people who constructed the memorial.  She's taken it upon herself to be more affected to the point that she is complaining to her boss because the OP mentioned something the family just did in her nephew's memory."]}
