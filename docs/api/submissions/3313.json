Her son overdosed) \n\nShe then proceeded to get a VERY elaborate, but sloppy, memorial tattoo down one arm that can only be described as a Doctor Bronners bottle...random images, rambling text...I am surprised any tattoo artist would even agree to it. \n\nAnd here we are 2 years later. She STILL uses every opportunity to cry on her bar to get attention, particularly people who aren't regulars because they end up tipping well.

Is one less of an aunt to a child because they are married to a parent's sibling, rather than a sibling, themselves? That's just minimizing her connection to the child,  and that's just shitty.  Strike Two.\n\nYou've known the family for 25 years. But you don't have any social relationship with HER, as you said you wouldn't have occasion to see her outside your job.
