For background, she makes twice as much as I do (for now, my boss told me he'll be almost doubling my salary two years from now). She generally works overnights and weekends (healthcare) and I work a 9-5. We essentially take turns taking care of the child while the other one is at work. I often leave work early or come in late to help accommodate her work and pumping schedule.\n\nShe has been breastfeeding and pumping since our child was born. Recently, her supply has dropped to the point where she's not pumping anymore but will still nurse the baby. This essentially eliminates hours of work from our day--hers from pumping, mine from cleaning the bottles and pumps every night. We did it, *she* did it, we made it, it's great. \n\nYesterday she told me that she wants to reward herself by going on an international vacation for a week with just her and her friend...this summer. \n\nHer arguments are that she deserves it, she's never been out of the country, and it's something she's always wanted to do and wants to do it before it's too late. I agree that she deserves it, but I think it's ridiculous that she thinks it's an acceptable thing to go to the other side of the world without her family for an entire week while our baby is still about 1.5 years old. I told her that it's one thing if she wanted to take a trip somewhere in the States, but to go to either SE Asia or Europe is entirely too big of an ask. \n\nFor me, it's the facts that our baby still needs her, this forces me to take a week off work, and the fact that she thinks it's appropriate whatsoever to do something like this. She's offered to fly her mom in for a week to help with childcare, which would help on my end but doesn't solve the issue. She says she doesn't feel like she should have to wait to save up enough to pay for both of us. \n\nI'm hurt she wants to go alone but understand she wants to reward herself, but I just think she's swinging for the fences at an inappropriate time. What happens if our baby gets sick? What if there's literally any kind of emergency? I told her if roles were reversed she would absolutely not approve of me leaving for an entire week to go on a vacation by herself. Am I the asshole for saying she shouldn't go on vacation?\n\nTl;dr wife just got done breastfeeding and wants to go on an international vacation without her family. I think it's a bad idea to go while the baby is so young\n\nEdit: guess I should have titled this \"AITA for not being thrilled she wanted to go on a solo vacation\".

Even with the extra help, it's a lot of work. Add in that you'd be using your vacation time for not-a- vacation and it just seems pretty unfair.

I don't think location matters as much as total time away.", "YTA. \n\nI'd say in general this is just a disagreement where no one is right or wrong. There is nothing wrong with a parent being away from their child for a week, and it is also okay to not want a parent to be away for a week when it isn't necessary at the moment. \n\nHowever, the fact that you think that you washing bottles is in any way a similar commitment to breastfeeding tells me all we need to know about you. When it comes to giving birth and breastfeeding, you didn't do shit. Cleaning a bottle is not comparable to being a literal food source for a living being. Your journey was not the same, not even close. \n\nThen, you don't know how she would feel if the roles were reversed. If she says no, you can't go away at another time for week, then she would be an AH, but she didn't say that. This was her idea, and something she wants to do, and you not wanting to do it or not asking in return doesn't create a valid argument as to why she can't go. \n\nAnd she has figured out additional child care so she isn't leaving you in a bind. If your child gets sick, you will deal with it. If there is an emergency, she will come home. And actually having one parent at home makes it so your baby is more likely to be fine than both of you going away together. \n\nYour wife has been physically attached to another living being first for 10 months creating and carrying your child, and then for another 16 months raising and breastfeeding. Sure an international vacation is not a necessary reward, but for two years she has not been free, and you DO NOT understand what that feels like, and your parenthood journey is NOT equal to hers.", "NTA because she expects you to use your vacation time so she can go alone.  You state she offered to have her mom help but in a comment you also state she expects you to still be there the whole time.

And you have way more concerns than that\n\nI think if that piece was coming from you this situation would be more iffy, but it sounds like it's something she would need you to do for her to be comfortable leaving for a week which is just...

I think some of your arguments are weak.  But I am sorry, I am a mother three times over and yes, having little ones is a lot of hard work, especially while working at the same time.  Been there.  But I assume she wanted this child.  It wasn\u2019t an unwanted surprise?  She hasn\u2019t done anything that  literally trillions of other women have done since the beginning of time, and under much worse conditions than she has suffered under.

A week isn't THAT long, and she probably needs the break. But then I would budget that amount of time so that I could go do something fun and of my choosing at another time.

For background, she makes twice as much as I do (for now, my boss told me he'll be almost doubling my salary two years from now). She generally works overnights and weekends (healthcare) and I work a 9-5. We essentially take turns taking care of the child while the other one is at work. I often leave work early or come in late to help accommodate her work and pumping schedule.\n\nShe has been breastfeeding and pumping since our child was born. Recently, her supply has dropped to the point where she's not pumping anymore but will still nurse the baby. This essentially eliminates hours of work from our day--hers from pumping, mine from cleaning the bottles and pumps every night. We did it, *she* did it, we made it, it's great. \n\nYesterday she told me that she wants to reward herself by going on an international vacation for a week with just her and her friend...this summer. \n\nHer arguments are that she deserves it, she's never been out of the country, and it's something she's always wanted to do and wants to do it before it's too late. I agree that she deserves it, but I think it's ridiculous that she thinks it's an acceptable thing to go to the other side of the world without her family for an entire week while our baby is still about 1.5 years old. I told her that it's one thing if she wanted to take a trip somewhere in the States, but to go to either SE Asia or Europe is entirely too big of an ask. \n\nFor me, it's the facts that our baby still needs her, this forces me to take a week off work, and the fact that she thinks it's appropriate whatsoever to do something like this. She's offered to fly her mom in for a week to help with childcare, which would help on my end but doesn't solve the issue. She says she doesn't feel like she should have to wait to save up enough to pay for both of us. \n\nI'm hurt she wants to go alone but understand she wants to reward herself, but I just think she's swinging for the fences at an inappropriate time. What happens if our baby gets sick? What if there's literally any kind of emergency? I told her if roles were reversed she would absolutely not approve of me leaving for an entire week to go on a vacation by herself. Am I the asshole for saying she shouldn't go on vacation?\n\nTl;dr wife just got done breastfeeding and wants to go on an international vacation without her family. I think it's a bad idea to go while the baby is so young\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Hell I was once told that me working in the yard  4 to 6 hours every week wasn\u2019t equivalent to my ex doing laundry every week (for the record, I did dishes every night, cleaned the bathroom every week, helped cook, buy groceries etc.). No matter what, you\u2019ll be told that what you do is nothing compared to her.\n\nThat said, she deserves a break and you should find a way to compromise\n\nTell your wife that you\u2019d prefer she wait another year or year and a half until the baby is older and that then you fully support her taking a vacation with her friend wherever, because she has earned it.

I don\u2019t tell you that to get back at her, but she should be ok with it. \n\nIf your wife refuses to wait, don\u2019t fight it. You can\u2019t do anything other than express your feelings.  But she should hear you and if she\u2019s not willing to compromise,i\u2019d recommend therapy to see what\u2019s really going on (she may feel resentful about something). \n\nFor the record,  anyone thinking I\u2019m an a~hole, my 2nd wife just finished grad school. She had internships all around the country. I had no issue supporting her dreams. I took care of the kids while she has away for several months  at a time. So I have no issues doing my part and supporting women. But when you have a kid, you have other priorities. Waiting year for the trip wouldn\u2019t be an unreasonable ask.", "YTA, none of the reasons you gave would actually require her to be there.

She is the one who was nursing your baby for so long, and she is the one who is the breadwinner in your family. I would encourage you not to compare nursing a baby (her job) to cleaning up his bottles (your job). She deserved this vacation, and it is not your place to tell her what to do.\n\nHer mother can look after your baby. I assume her mother can even take the baby to look after him at her own house.  So why do you need to take a week off work then? And why exactly do you think she will get mad if you will arrange the help for her and want to go on vacation for a week? Especially because it doesn't look like you are doing your share of parental job..\n\nIf the baby gets sick or if there are an emergency, you should handle it like any other responsible parent: take the baby to a doctor, give him medication, take him to a hospital if needed and handle all the insurance/pharmacy/health decision thingies.\n\nYour questions about it imply that all of it is her job.

She works overnights (healthcare) and at least one, sometimes both nights of the weekend so I'm more than used to taking care of the tiny human solo for 24-48 hours.\n\nShe's resistant to anything that costs money, and basically won't organize anything for herself.\n\nWhat are some things I could do for her so she feels she can take a night off?\n\nShe's said no to me getting her a hotel and spa day, since \"then I'm just pumping in a hotel room alone, and we can't afford it\". I've offered to take our son to a friend's house for the night, but then she's \"just pumping at home alone\". She won't take the initiative to ask friends to go do anything, and will usually shoot down any idea that I have for one reason or another. Her best friend she always went to the climbing gym with moved to Nevada for a travel nursing contract, and this person would usually babysit for free for a date night here and there for us, but we both live across the country from our parents and getting a babysitter is expensive so it generally means one person stays at home while the other leaves the house.\n\nAny ideas fellow dads?", "Honestly the roles reversing does not work in this situation because you did not birth this child and breastfeed and pump for over a year. Breastfeeding and pumping is already a full time job (literally. It\u2019s equivalent hour wise to a full time job when you include over nights and the first few months when babies cluster feed). She was pregnant for 10 months\u2014dealing with all the hormone changes, aches and pains, etc. Then she gave birth. She pushed a baby through her vaginal canal and dealt with the aftermath of that\u2014statistically most women tear and deal with pain and incontinence after childbirth if delivering vaginally. Recovery is even harder if she had a c-section. Hormones after childbirth and weaning from breastfeeding are a TRIP. Also, do you know how much money she saved your family by breastfeeding/pumping instead of using formula? A lot of money. \n\nSo yeah, you are the asshole for not letting your wife decompress the way she wants to after all she has done for you and your family. You are equally responsible for your child. You should both feel comfortable individually handling any and all tasks and emergencies that come up with your child. After having kids, moms can often feel like a shell of ourselves. We NEED to know we exist outside of just being mom and/or wife. If your wife is normally soft spoken or doesn\u2019t assert her needs, she will resent you for not letting her go.

But like how long is she supposed to be chained to this kid and never allowed to leave (because I kinda don't believe that he'd be okay with anywhere in the states either, but maybe that's just me)? \n\nIf this was a question just about the vacation alone I could understand - I wouldn't blame him if he was just miffed about missing out on the vacation. But framing it all in the context of BuT tHe BaAaAaAaByYyYyYyY is ridiculous. Just... figure it out, dude, no one gave her a magical secret book to know how to handle things, she just handles them.", "That's what I'm saying. Like I get that there are a lot of arguments that can be made about why he would object. I'm not at all saying that there aren't. What I am saying is that the objections he raised here just seem like bullshit, frankly, and make him sound pretty incompetent.", "Imagine climbing the cross and nailing yourself to it every time someone maybe suggests that pregnancy is not the hardest thing a person can endure.", "I have 3 kids and we always went away on solo trips.  I went away for a week when my youngest was 4 months old.  Their Dad looked after all 3 (5, 2.5, 4 months) on his own.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal.", "'What if the kidneys shut down? Babies have kidneys right?'- op, probably.", "Two points:\n\n1. Baby is actually a toddler and is probably sleeping through the night already (or at least getting close at this point).\n2. She works at night. So she's taking care of baby during the day and working her hospital job at night. There's no time for her to sleep.", "Happy cake day to you!", "I glanced through and saw he said kid was in bed by 8 and he had time to get some gaming in before midnight ...", "No, he did that all  by himself, no one made him look bad.", "But that\u2019s because of the long weekend shifts. When does she do 24-48 hours alone w the baby? He\u2019s not gone for that many hours straight. He does a shift, and he comes home. I am a wife speaking\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t want my husband to leave me alone w the kids for a week, and even when we only had one, no way I would have accepted him leaving me alone for even a weekend. Especially wouldn\u2019t have wanted him to save up money a vaca only for himself\u2026. \n \nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what this couple is arguing about\u2026 I don\u2019t think this is about division of labor. I think those things are being mentioned because he needs to come up with every practical reason why it wouldn\u2019t work. But\u2026in the practical sense, there is no reason why she can\u2019t go and why he couldn\u2019t handle it. I feel like he just hasn\u2019t been able to articulate what\u2019s really bothering him about it, but he gave a clue. \n\nI think it\u2019s because she wants to go without him, and doesn\u2019t want to wait to save up enough money for them to go together. She\u2019d much rather go now, with a friend instead of later with him. I wouldn\u2019t want my husband to do that. People are making this out to be about weaponized incompetence, and other common male behaviors when it comes to domestic things that are problematic\u2026 but I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s what this is.", "Wow, I'm amazed. If I don't get a pretty consistent 7-8 hours a night, I start picking up every cold and flu that goes around. That's a tough schedule!"]}
