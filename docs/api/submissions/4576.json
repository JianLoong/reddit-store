She hadn\u2019t seen them in years - and it was Thursday - Sunday to Budapest (we\u2019re UK based). Because of timings, she\u2019d be going straight to the airport from her office. \n\nThursday morning, I got a phone call from our son\u2019s (10) school saying that there\u2019d been an accident, and that it was most likely a broken arm. Of course I went right to school to pick him up and then we got triaged at A&E. \n\nNow at this point I made the conscious decision to not tell my wife - she\u2019d been looking forward to the trip for months and she hadn\u2019t seen some of her friends for 5 years or more. I also knew that if she heard about it she would panic and cancel the trip to help look after our kid. \n\nAnd in my view - the injury, while painful, was not life threatening or critical. To be honest, injuries like these are a part and parcel of growing up. \n\nSo when my wife video called us, me and the boy agreed not to mention it and held the phone at strategic angles so she\u2019s only see our faces. \n\nShe found out yesterday when we picked her up for the airport and upset we hadn\u2019t told her. But then she became even more upset when she learned it happened before she actually left the country. \n\nShe said what a bad mother she was that she wasn\u2019t there for her son.

I would totally expect to get shit when she got home, but you know your wife well enough to know she would cancel her trip. You were damned ether way. Getting the kid to lie... well that could be questionable. Might be worth having a sit down with both Mom and Kid to explain the rational.

I think you had good intentions letting your wife go on a stress-free holiday, but that is quite the thing to hide. But you\u2019re right, it wasn\u2019t life threatening, just painful.

You should have told her then. And you are even more the asshole for having a video call and lying to her. You are also the asshole for encouraging your child to lie on the video call.

First, you made a decision on her behalf that was rightfully hers to make. Then the bigger, worse fuck-up: encouraging your child to lie to her. You showed her an enormous amount of disrespect, you damaged her trust in you, and you set a poor example for your child.", "YTA.

Personally, I would have told her that night after she arrived and was squared away where she was staying - maybe too late to try to leave right away. Because while your heart was in the right place and you had everything under control, in her eyes the wonderful time she just had with her friends was all a lie. So she wound up worried anyway and can\u2019t enjoy the memories of the trip. \n\nI\u2019m glad your kiddo is ok!", "NTA...you were there and you took care of your son and yourself and ensured your wife had a guilt free good time.  \n\nWell done on being a good husband and a great father.", "Nta", "This is hard. I don't think you're the asshole because it came from a place of good intentions, but I do think you took away her ability to make decisions and I'm not sure how I feel about that. Even if the intention was good, you still manipulated the situation by lying. If I had a partner who did something like that, I would be upset about it. But I'm also the kind of person who would trust my partner if they said \"Everything is okay, please go enjoy your trip and let me call you if I need you to come back.\" If you've been together long enough to have a 10-year-old, you probably know her well enough to predict her reaction accurately, and that kind of reaction seems about as unhealthy as the dishonesty. So I think you ultimately made the best decision for everyone involved, but I hope you both can get to a place where you don't have to be dishonest about this kind of thing and she doesn't feel the need to panic and involve herself unnecessarily. Regardless, NAH.", "NTA Your son not just you wanted to make sure your wife had a wonderful trip, and both of you decided that her staying to worry about him when he already had you to take care of him would be sacrificing a lot for nothing more than the right to worry and obsess about an issue that had been handled.\n\nYes, every child needs his mother, but this NOT a \"need\" situation on anyone's part, unless she considers the right to worry as a need in a situation like this where she couldn't have done anything more but add more stress. Sometimes a kid can do just fine without mom's presence if Dad is around.\n\nBelieve it or not, many people including children do NOT like to be a source of pointless worry. It's not fun, and it makes the ill or injured person feel like it's now their job to make the \"needlessly worried\" person feel better about their condition taking away time they should be spending on healing.\n\nSo in the end, by the mom enjoying her trip the kid also avoided having his mother worrying about something that had been handled by his Dad already. He didn't have to spend time trying to make her feel better about his injury.\n\nYour wife's upset seems to me to be more about you usurping her \"caring\" role more than anything else, because there is absolutely NOTHING she could have done had she been there other than miss a great trip to worry about your son.\n\nTo be upset about this is truly the very definition of a \"a rich woman's worry\". There are literally multiple millions of women in this world would consider your actions to be that of a dream husband come true. There are literally millions of women who have no partner to depend on. \n\nYour wife should temper her \"personal\" feelings with a dose of reality around her. If she does, I'm sure she will find literally dozens of women who she has met and remembered who are far less fortunate than she is including women who are just as well off as she is and married albeit to a husband who would have called the airline and cancelled her trip for her so that she could stay home and take care of the boy, because they had better things to do and caring isn't a man's job.", "I'm going to say NTA. While a broken bone is serious, unless surgery is required to help fix it, most of the time you are sent right home with a cast. As for your wife, I feel like you were in a no win situation. Had you told her and she canceled her trip, she may have resented the fact she didn't/couldn't go after fact. As for your son,  I'm assuming he knew how much that trip meant to his mom.  Otherwise, I don't think he'd be as willing to go along with not telling her.", "NTA. Your son was fine and you were there. Telling her would have just worried her and ruined her trip.", "NTA but I understand why she is upset, it sounds like she's worried about how her parenting is perceived by others and that's obviously coming from somewhere, reassure her she's a great Mum, and it's her input that's made the kid able to handle a set back like this so well. Then maybe after a little time gently explore where those insecurities she has are coming from.", "Slight YTA. I understand why you kept it from her. As a mother I probably would have cancelled as well just because it really hurts to think our children are in pain without us there to help. I am glad she got to go on the trip but I also think she should have been told as soon as she had left for the trip. Having a child keep information from a parent isn\u2019t great.", "Gentle YTA. As a mom I would be livid that my husband took away my autonomy to decide if I want to be there for my child. That was her decision even though I know why you did it.", "YTA. A broken bone is a big deal and it wasn't fair to blindside her like that.", "Leaning toward YTA, but only softly. This is almost a NAH. I feel your wife should've been able to make that decision herself, but your intentions were in the right place and I see where both you and your wife are coming from. I wouldn't sweat this too hard, if you and your wife are both reasonable people this should be water under the bridge in no time.", "NAH at all. Your son and you were awesome for making sure she had a good time and as a mom I understand her feeling guilty after the fact.", "Nah\n\nI am sure she wanted to be there and feels guilty. \n\nBut as you said it\u2019s a broken arm. Another parent wouldn\u2019t change that. Your kid was OK without Mum. \n\nGood on you for letting her have a holiday. \n\nShe will calm down once she gets a handle on her guilt. \n\nI swear parenting is I feel guilty for doing too much for the kids swinging to I feel guilty for not doing enough. And continually swinging to both extremes", "Soft YTA. She had a right to make that decision for herself and you took that from her. Yes your heart was in the right place but the results kinda suck", "But telling the kid to lie to mom and showing him how to hide the arm on the video camera is  AH", "Yeah, she has a right as his mom to be upset no one told her that her kid was hurt, I don't think she should hold it against him though. As you said, his heart was in the right place amd everyone else posting mentioned he seemed to have a pretty solid handle on the situation so it's not like he mishandled care or refused to take his son to the hospital.", "[This is the post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhfmkn/aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_about_our_sons/) which is was very similar to this story.", "why?", "It happened at school.", "I see your point? But the boy is 10, and if this is the only/1st time that dad has ever suggested he lie to mom? I think they're OK. \n\nTo me his intention (as best as I can figure it out) is the most important reason for the exception. We're not lying to mom \"for her own good\" so we can get away with more stuff. But so that she can relax....", "Reddit users always find a way to make a mountain out of a mole hill", "Good point. \n\nBut I believe that OP knows his wife really really well. And he knows that she has a hard time relaxing, letting go, maybe even trusting him to care for kids/home.\n\nTo me the good that was done for OP's wife, and even for OP's child, outweighs his dicey choice to deny her agency. (The kid now understands that he is resilient and can get through something painful and hard w/o his mom.)", "Exactly. Once mom is off the plane or reachable then own up. Let her know the kid is fine, have them talk, and then reassure her one more time that you've got it handled and will keep the kid happy and on whatever painkillers the doctor suggested. \n\nBut asking the kid to lie to a parent? That's just never a good idea.", ">encouraging your child to lie to her.\n\nThis is what changed my mind from NAH to YTA.", "He did \"not tell his wife their son was injured\" because she didn't know. Therefore that statement is correct. Sometimes some little lies are beneficial because the mother may have been put through more stress and be upset that she couldn't go and see her old friends that she hadn't seen for ages.\n\nI'm not seeing any grooming here.. \"agreed not to mention it\" isn't grooming, you are jumping to conclusions. How do you know that OP didn't have a rational conversation with his son, and mutually agreed not to mention it. There was no \"instruction\" involved as far as either you or I know. Nor is there any disregard for the boy's need or preferences. I would argue that its quite likely that the boy did not need his mother as he said \"I don't care you weren't there\" that sounds like a normal kid to me, just at that age where boys distance theirselves form their mothers. There was nothing that suggested that the kid was told to say that.\n\nYou are jumping to conclusions on an astronomical scale. You have no way near enough information to make these judgements about a random guy on reddit.\n\nTherefore, I'm saying NTA.", "So similar. But those dynamics are very common?

Exact same...  down to the broken arm.", "Except in that post she was on a cruise with zero ability to rush home, I think. \n\nBut yeah, weirdly similar", "And ten dollars says you're a woman who likes to judge men and jump to conclusions without the facts. I have laid out a convincing argument countering your points, and you have replied trying to undermine my points by trying to insult me. I have yet to hear you disprove my points...", "You find it insulting that I assumed you were a man? That sounds dysphoric.", "Wow, way to intentionally miss the point. He didn't find it insulting you assumed he was a man, he find it insulting you tried to disregard his arguments because he's a man."]}
