She has been distant for a few months, to the point that I was just worried about her. But she came to our \"pre-wedding dinner\" (because we didn't want a wild party but rather something chill) and there she said that the reason why she was distant was because she got pregnant and was trying to learn everything about parenting to be ready for the baby. She is a very anxious person, so when discovered her pregnancy went into her \"I most know everything about this topic\" mode. But now she was calmer because her boyfriend is supporting her a lot, and is ready to announce the pregnancy, but that could still wait.\n\nShe is still not heavily pregnant, so it can be \"stealth\" with the right clothes, lucky her dress for the wedding is not tight so the belly wouldn't be noticeable unless you look very closely. I asked her if our parents knew, and she said \"not yet\" I just told her to \"not worry about it\" and \"I would take care of it\".\n\nSo, the wedding went great, my fianc\u00e9 looked so hot in his suit, gave me some sweet vows and a hot kiss after the \"I do\".  At the reception, I had a chance to give a speech. It was a normal speech, I dedicated a long portion of it to thank everybody to come, I had some word for my lovely new husband, and then I spoke about my sister, about how much I love her and appreciate having her as my best friend, and ended up by saying \"I can't wait to be an aunt\". She came to me crying, I put my hand at her belly before hugging her, and everybody knew what that means. She got a lot of congratulations for the rest of the night until it finished. I was happy for her.\n\nBut the moment the event ended and we got into our car to come back home, my husband started berating me. Asking What was that? The fuck was you thinking? Who's wedding is it? ours or hers?\n\nHe didn't calm down and was still angry that night and the next day he told me \"You made me a background character at my own wedding\"\n\nNow he is threatening to do not go to our already paid honeymoon unless I apologize to him and redo the reception (somehow), he is also angry that no one in his family is supporting him on this, so is taking it on me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685042507, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rqoyk/aita_for_announcing_my_sisters_pregnancy_at_my/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was his day and your sister\u2019s news took away from that. You should have had both of their consent to make an announcement like that. It sounds like your sister isn\u2019t upset but you do owe your husband an apology.", "YTA. announcing a pregnancy or impending wedding at someone else's wedding requires the consent of the people said event is honoring. You were only half of that equation, your husband's consent was just important as yours. It also doesn't sound like you even asked your sister if it was OK first and her consent should have been top of the list, although admittedly it doesn't sound as if she's upset about it ao that's good but I wouldn't blame her if she was. \n\nNow redoing the reception is a wildly unrealistic and unreasonable ask but also if that was his initial reaction it might have been more of an emotional response than anything, I'd start by apologizing sincerely and then have a discussion from there. Hopefully once he calms down a bit he'll realize that redoing it is just not feasible.", "What the fuck dude? How was that at all your info to share? YTA majorly", "YTA. You never actually got your sister's permission to announce her pregnancy. And you completely blindsided your new husband. At a minimum, you should have gotten the go-ahead from both of them. You did neither.", "YTA- I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d even think that\u2019s appropriate? You\u2019re a massive massive massive AH.\n\n\nThe ONLY people who should ever ever announce a pregnancy are the pregnant couple unless they\u2019ve specifically requested for someone else to do it and to do it in front of so many people when she\u2019s already struggling with the anxiety of becoming a mother is a vile thing to do. If my sister did that to me I wouldn\u2019t ever speak to her again or let her see the baby so you\u2019re lucky your sister reacted the way she did. \n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that 25% of pregnancies result in miscarriage in most countries with 80% of those happening within the first 3 months which is why a lot of women keep it low key as announcing the loss of your child is a traumatising thing to do.\n\nAside from how you treated your sister, you did also make your husbands wedding about someone else and I would be livid if my spouse did that to me. He\u2019s valid.", "Yta\n\nYou literally could have ruined your relationship with your sister. \n\n\nHow is this ok?\n\nYes, your husband is being extreme.  But you taking it upon yourself to announce news that wasn't yours to share makes you the biggest ah.\n\n\nI hope you have checked in with your sister to make sure she is ok. If she has anxiety, she might be overwhelmed with what you did. You took a massive gamble with your actions.\n\nYour husband also had the right for you to check with him as well. The couple should have known before hand and so should have your husband.", "YTA...\n\nThis whole thing sounded tacky... And you definitely took it to a next level. Hubby is in for a ride...", "So you just made yourself the main character in your sister\u2019s pregnancy. YTA.", "YTA. \n\nI agree with your husband even though I do think his response is a little immature. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t announce other people\u2019s pregnancies.", "YTA.

Seems like you were doing an odd bit of grandstanding.\n\nBut, at the same time, your husband sounds like an asshole.  I mean, just roll with it, man.  I definitely don't think he should be berating you.  Having said that, I can completely empathize with the feeling of having your thunder stolen by someone else's ***HUGE*** life-milestone announcement.\n\nHe's right that no one is supporting him.  Who would support someone acting so childishly?  At the same time, how did you make these decisions?  What was the thought process here?  Did you discuss the announcement with your husband?  Did it need to be done right there?\n\nIt's bewildering.\n\nESH (except your sister).", "ESH (not the sister)\n\nThis whole situation is strange.

Why didn't you tell your husband first?", "ESH. I'm not sure how he expects you to \"redo the reception\" but you do owe him an apology.

It's his wedding, too.\n\nYTA", "YTA", ">Now he is threatening to do not go to our already paid honeymoon unless I apologize to him and redo the reception (somehow)\n\nOk this is a concerning reaction. Very OTT. But OP, what if the parents wanted to announce their first pregnancy themselves? What if your sister anxiety got triggered by a very public announcement at your wedding that she wasn't expecting? You had the best intentions, but yeah, I am going to have to agree YTA. For future, the new parents usually like to announce these things themselves and you should have checked in with your husband.

Unless you talked to the groom about making the announcement at your wedding, you had no right to do so. Your husband's reaction is WAY over the top!\n\nESH!", "ESH. \n\nDemanding to re-do the reception makes no sense, but literally why did you do that? This was an occasion to celebrate you and your new husband, and you made it about your sister without discussing that with him first? Leaving him out of that decision is a bad note to start this partnership on.", "At last - a groomzilla!!!  YTA.  It wasn't your wedding  - it was yours and hubby's.  Hopefully,  it's just a lesson learned and y'all get over it.  You can apologize for not cluing him in before you did it.  Yes, he's overreacting by making threats and demands about the honeymoon.

That wasn't your news to tell. You are lucky your sister isn't upset but if someone else told people I was pregnant, I would blow my top. You don't get to do that. You don't get to pick when she tells either.\n\nAlso, it isn't just your wedding. You have a groom and it is his big day. You don't get to play the \"oh, he can't keep a secret\" card without clearing it with him.", "Ok in retrospect, yeah, you should have checked.

You had a whole day to shine and you ruined it for yourself and ruined something special for your sister.", "YTA. It wasn't just your wedding. There's a reason most brides don't like people announcing things at their wedding. Him being a man doesn't change that (I don't think people would be calling him a child if the roles were reversed.) Weddings are already heavily focused on the bride. Add a pregnant family member on top of that, I can imaging why he felt unseen.", "ESH-- except your sister.  You shouldn't have made that announcement without her explicit permission (that was her news to announce NOT yours.)  Your husband should have been included in the decision to  make the announcement after your sister agreed.  That said his over reaction -- refusing to go on the honeymoon unless you redo the reception ( seriously that's ridiculous).  Does he normally behave like a spoiled toddler?   The upside is it sounds like the rest of his family is pretty intelligent.", "ESH, You and new husband both suck. You should have talked to him about it first. You then talk to your sister and get permission to announce HER pregnancy. Big decisions should be made as a couple. He sucks for his on going hissy fit. You do owe him a BIG apology. A reception redo? Not sure how you do that. Not going on the honeymoon? Unless he feels this is a marriage ending event that seems pretty drastic.

You 2 sure aren\u2019t starting out too well with communication skills and boundaries.", "ESH apart from your sister. Wrong place to announce it, you didn\u2019t had sister\u2019s permission, it takes away from the wedding and the two of you and you husband didn\u2019t know about it.

Very.", "ESH except your sister. the way he\u2019s feeling is valid, but god the reaction is so immature. you should\u2019ve asked him what he wanted to do, it\u2019s his big day just as much as your\u2019s. you didn\u2019t have malicious intent, but still probably should\u2019ve thought it through more. that being said, him asking you to redo the whole reception is childish and unreasonable.", "I\u2019m 36 weeks pregnant reading this and I had a hard time announcing it to my friends, family, and socials. So, I can understand if your sister asked for help sharing the news and if she wanted it done soon. Not sure\u2026. You sound like a proud aunt very excited, but I hope your sister was aware of it being announced the way it was. I\u2019ve never seen someone announce a pregnancy at their own wedding, but it should have been discussed with fianc\u00e9 prior. Hopefully y\u2019all can resolve things and just chalk this up to a mistake and move on supporting your sister the ways she needs.", "ESH.. except the sister...\n\n1. Your husband is insanely juvenile. The groom is pretty much always a background character at the wedding. They show up in a rental tux, do the vows, do the congratulations, the cake and the dance and let their bride shine. It's the bride's day.\n2. That being said, why you think \"your wedding\" excuses announcing something as private as someone else's pregnancy, regardless of how hot your husband looked and how moist the kiss made you, confuses the shit out of me.", "YTA, but only a little bit\n\nThere is a rule about not proposing, announcing engagements or announcing pregnancies at weddings, but those rules generally apply to others, not the bride. So, it's definitely a gray area. That said, it was his wedding too and your sister's pregnancy was an unnecessary distraction. There was no need to announce it and no purpose other than to shift attention to her, and you to a certain extent. \n\nHis reaction seems strangely over the top. Like, really red flag over the top unless we're missing something. \n\nDo you still do other traditions like first dance, cake cutting, etc?", "NTA. Your new husband\u2019s reaction is a huge concern though. Berating you, the silent treatment, and threatening to skip your honeymoon are all extreme behaviors. Have you considered annulment?

Annul the AH, he sounds like a petulant toddler", "Nah, when people think of a wedding they think of the bride and the groom is a supporting actor in most weddings anyway. I think it's extremely rare for a groom to have input on a wedding besides 1 or 2 requests. Mostly they're like \"Do what you want babe\". So to think he would be upset is a little wild. But understandable. It was his day too, so you could have consulted him first. But I do think he is overreacting.

You also most definitely suck for not broaching the subject with your husband prior, it was his wedding too and big announcements should have been a joint decision with the two of you. \n\nIf you have kids will you even tell him before you announce it?", "YTA. That wasn't the time or place to announce something so huge. Also, it's up to your sister to do that. You took her spotlight and the spotlight off your entire wedding.", "YTA  It was supposed the wedding reception for bride and groom. You made it a party for bride and MOH. He got left out at his own reception. It wasn't something you'd agreed on doing.", "I really can\u2019t make a judgment because I\u2019m not sure what your speech was truly like and if your husband is normally this volatile when he gets upset. What I can say is it doesn\u2019t matter what we commenters say to you. What matters is your husband\u2019s feelings. You may not be married long if he continues to feel and act like you minimized him at his own wedding. I don\u2019t know if you really did or not. All I know is his reaction seems extreme, and you may have serious challenges with your marriage moving forward. You may need couples counseling if you don\u2019t break up over this.", "Did you have your sister's consent? If so, NTA.\n\nYour husband sounds like a big baby. Weddings are about family. He can't get over himself to be happy for his sister-in-law's exciting news? You were already married and on to the party", "Don\u2019t apologize to your childish husband. Instead, call his bluff about the honeymoon\u2026take your sister instead!", "YTA. It sounds like you wanted a wedding,  not a marriage. Why else would you think only of yourself and not your partner?", "How old are you guys?", "YTA.", "YTA\nYou should have gotten your husband's consent. It was as much his day as yours.", "Yta. His reaction is over the top and ridiculous but it wasn\u2019t your business to announce.", "YTA. Not a fan of wedding speeches myself but if you are going to do it it's supposed to be about the person you're marrying. You brag up your new spouse and give a nod to family not the other way around.", "Yta for not talk to you husband beforehand. It not just your wedding it's him too.", "YTA", "Omg you married a psycho. Good luck.", "Not to mention maybe sis wasn't ready to fucking tell anyone...and PROBABLY wanted to do it...I dunno...herself?", "Yeah I thought it went a different route. Took me by surprise. But OP, YTA. If you\u2019re going to announce something like this, you should\u2019ve talked to both your husband and your sister.", "She married him for looking hot, is my take. Who knows if this is gonna last, eh?", "(A small nitpick, but I am not OP.  LOL)", "Omg what? Apparently you can\u2019t keep a secret either.", "u/individualregret4195\n\n>Problem is my husband can't keep a secret\n\nSAYS THE WOMAN WHO; WITHOUT PERMISSION, ANNOUNCED IT TO A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE. WITHOUT THE OK FROM THE 2 PEOPLE INVOLVED. You are 1000000% a main character arent you"]}
