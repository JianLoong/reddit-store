Well she has pica and my brother(30M) will let her eat whatever. This includes chemical stuff like weed killers. She was recently hospitalized after eating plant fertilizer. He admitted to sitting there watching her do it. Now this isn't the first time something like this has happened. A has been hospitalized 5 times in the last 3 months because of drinking chemicals or eating some non food item. I(18M) called CPS because I didn't want her to get hurt because her father refused to do anything. My mother(56F) has had custody of her for the last 2 month months and she's doing a lot better. We've gotten her into therapy and I watch her closely so she doesn't eat any non food items. My mother thinks it was a good idea to call CPS but of course my father(57M) doesn't think so. He completely ignores everything and just like my brother thinks it's funny. I've caught him watching her eat used cat litter and laughing about it. I was in the shower so my mom was supposed to be watching her but she had to go somewhere. He think me and my mom are assholes for calling CPS saying she's just a kid. She was diagnosed with pica when she was 7.
