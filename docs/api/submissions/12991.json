Partially from how my sister in law treated her over Christmas. M didn't feel welcomed by my family and felt like an outcast.\n\nI can have empathy with her sentiment. Because my sister in law is a very honest person, and she doesn't really sugar coat stuff. I told her (and warned her) that my family can be thick skinned, unemotional and practical.\n\nShe also has a problem with my relationship with my mother. She says I overshare. And I will admit, I do talk to my mum about almost everything. But that's because she was my support system growing up, and it's just always been like that. I am who I am today because of her.\n\nNow, on to the main problem. M and I was supposed to visit my mum during Easter. But my girlfriend has to run a workshop for her company.\n\nThis workshop means a lot to M, and can really boost her career. But if we leave after her workshop, we will be driving when the road is at it's busiest on Easter. Its a 6-7 hour drive.\n\nMy mom suggested that I leave with a friend (28, F) (\"T\") the day before the workshop to avoid all that traffic. We will avoid traffic and save some cash on fuel costs. And then I will return with her after 5 days. \n\nWhen I told M about the new arrangements, she got upset because she haven't met T yet. T is an old highschool friend of mine that M just didn't have an opportunity to meet yet. She also asked me to let her come along, that she doesn't want to spend easter alone (she's not close to her family).\n\nShe also said that if I went on my own, I could stay longer (a whole week) instead of just 5 days with T.\n\nI called my mum to ask her opinion. But my mum won't allow me to drive on our pre-arranged day because of the horrible traffic. She just wants me to be safe and drive with T. Which is completely reasonable, I think.\n\n\nI told her this and she responded, verbatim \"Why do you need your mother's permission to not drive with this woman? You're 28 and a grown man, I don't get it.\" \n\nI told her its not about my friend, but about respecting my mothers wishes.\n\nMy girlfriend flat out told me that she doesn't want me going with that woman, and that this is a boundary she's putting.\n\nI get boundaries but I have never restricted her of spending time with her male friends. I told her she's way too controlling, and that this isn't a big deal. And that I won't allow her to stop me from spending time with family members.\n\nBut she started crying and shut herself in the spare bedroom. She's avoiding me and giving me the cold shoulder. She hasn't slept in our bed ever since, and it's been a few days since this happened.

Especially if they already don't seem to get along.", "YTA, not only you are willing to leave your GF on her own on a very important event, you actually treat your mother's words as more important. I wouldn't want to have a life with a person, who will always be a momma boy and do as she pleases disregarding the relationship with SO.

It seems like mom doesn't approve of M and wants you to bring T. But you're 28, I'm pretty sure you can drive yourself safely to your mother's house. \n\n\nI think M just feels a type of way bc you're gonna leave her on Easter bc she has to work to go spend 5 days with a girl your mom obviously prefers over her. She's not over emotional or anything. If she was close with her family and they said \"oh your bf can't make it? Bring a different man and come stay with us anyway with this 2nd man.\" It's weird. It'd be different if you went alone but the addition of another girl is weird.", "YTA.

I don't think you are as rational as you think you are. You are just doing what your mother wants, rather than what is rational. You think you going with T and avoiding bad traffic is reasonable but to me it looks like an emotional decision designed to cut out M who your mother dislikes. Basically if your mother says it's good or bad you think it's rational or reasonable but you presume your GFs decisions are emotional.\n\nI suspect the problem will be solved soon because your gf will break up with you (and with good reason) but yeah, YTA.\n\nAnd look, I'm someone who is close to her mother, so I get that. But what you are describing goes way beyond that. You aren't just over sharing, you also seem to be completely reliant on your mother to make decisions, and don't seem to be able to decide what you want. And that won't just be a problem for M, but for most partners.", "YTA. Your gf is right. You're an adult and can choose how you're going to travel. This whole situation sounds weird, like your gf isn't invited amd you're leaving her alone. Your mother for whatever reason really wants you to go with T because of \"Easter traffic\", which let's be honest is hardly any worse than usual traffic, it's not even a 3 day weekend. To me it sounds like your mother is trying to set you up with T but idk enough about the background to honestly make that assumption.", "YTA - your girlfriend is completely right. At 28 years old, why do you need your mother to tell you how to get to Easter? You decide what is important and do that. \n\nIf you are happy with your girlfriend, who has no family, being alone for the holiday so you can beat traffic, do it. But don\u2019t try to blame your mother like it\u2019s her decision.\n\nAlso, you rushed her away from spending time with her father who had a stroke. Just break up.

You brush this off as them being \u201cthick skinned.\u201d\n\n2. You over share personal details with your mom. Assuming this includes about your relationship, which your girlfriend has expressed discomfort with. Probably because she values her privacy, and you\u2019re not respecting that. \n\n3. Your mom is somehow forcing you to drive on a different day, with another woman, and leave your girlfriend behind. Taking advantage of your girlfriend\u2019s work commitment to try and get you to come along and drive a wedge between you and the GF she\u2019s treated badly in the last. \n\n4. Your GF asks, reasonably, why a 28 year old man needs his mommy\u2019s permission to travel, when and with whom. \n\nThis is clearly not about controlling you. It\u2019s about your family disrespecting her at every turn, and now clearly trying to set you up with someone else and leave her behind, and your complete lack of backbone.

Today is the day you grow up and start making your own decisions.\n\nYour GF is rightly frustrated because you seem incapable of traveling by yourself as an adult, and probably is irritated that your solution to your overbearing mother isn't to tell her to BUTT OUT but to catch a ride with some lady she doesn't know because you're too passive to assert your independence from your mother.", "Info: Why are you asking us when you're just going to do what your mom tells you to do?", "YTA, grow up and act like a man.

But my girlfriend has to run a workshop for her company.\n\nThis workshop means a lot to M, and can really boost her career. But if we leave after her workshop, we will be driving when the road is at it's busiest on Easter. Its a 6-7 hour drive.\n\nMy mom suggested that I leave with a friend (28, F) (\"T\") the day before the workshop to avoid all that traffic. We will avoid traffic and save some cash on fuel costs. And then I will return with her after 5 days. \n\nWhen I told M about the new arrangements, she got upset because she haven't met T yet.

I am VERY close to my son, so I understand where you are coming from but you aren\u2019t a child. This is an issue your girlfriend has spoken to you about before and even though you want to make this about a friendship it is about a much larger and more important issue: \nAt some point, you have to decide which family comes first, the one you have or the one you are making and what kind of future you want. This is just the first of many decisions where you will have to choose and it will hurt but if you want a future with a wife and/or children those are the people who come first- not your mother. \n\nIt\u2019s time for hard questions:\nIS this is the woman you see a future with?\nIS this the woman who is worth it? \nIf not, you need to let her go so she can find that person willing to put her first \nIf so, you need to show her that you do.\n\nI will share with you a personal example. I remember being a few months out of the hospital after a major surgery and experiencing a lot of pain. My oldest child was still young and I was breastfeeding. He was very particular about when he would eat and seemed sensitive to heat (we found out much later he has a medical condition). I had a great deal of difficulty walking and because of time in the hospital needed to be together to bond with my son. My husbands whole family was going on an outing together and of course wanted us there. I wasn\u2019t up to it. I was worried about walking distances, being able to feed him and him being willing to eat. My husband didn\u2019t want to say no. We fought and he finally mentioned my worries to his mother. The solution they suggested was taking the baby without me and letting him just have a bottle. In their minds: Problem solved! But that idea broke my heart. He could have a bottle true. I was the one who couldn\u2019t do long walks and my husband would have the whole family there to help. On paper it made sense, but feelings aren\u2019t on paper and mine were very hurt. He WASNT SUPPOSED TO TELL HER the problem, he WAS SUPPOSED TO TELL HER NO! I told him the baby was absolutely not going without me. He refused calling his mom again. He threatened to take the baby without me. I went. He insisted I was wrong anyway and \u201cit would be fine!\u201d\nIt was awful. I was in extreme pain. The baby wouldn\u2019t eat. Every prediction I made was true. I had no satisfaction from I told you so. We nearly divorced- because it wasn\u2019t the only time and the only thing. It wasn\u2019t about one trip. It was about US, and putting us first.\n\nMy second child was born. Now, my husband calls his mom and presents a UNITED front. WE aren\u2019t going, sorry mom. Her reply is almost always, \u201cok, maybe next time\u201d. He says it\u2019s no big deal and doesn\u2019t understand why it used to be so hard. \n\nA friend of mine, her husband insisted on going out with his friends even after their child was born. She needed help. He didn\u2019t want to tell them no. THEY went out so why couldn\u2019t he. his friends left their wives at home. Why couldn\u2019t he. She wasn\u2019t his friends wives, she was his. This wasn\u2019t his friends baby, it was his. It wasn\u2019t about his friends marriages- it was about his. They are now divorced and she is married to her 2nd husband, with 2 more children and yes he goes out to see his friends- when his family doesn\u2019t need him.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about driving with a girl. This is about respecting something and caring about something because a person you love cares deeply about it. It\u2019s about putting her and who you are together (\u201cus\u201d) first. You said you\u2019re \u2018just respecting your mothers wishes\u2019 and \u2018she won\u2019t allow you to drive\u2019 because of the traffic. Well- now you also need to respect your girlfriend\u2019s wishes and understand that she won\u2019t allow you to drive with your other friend.

And also...either way you would've went to visit your mom. So why try and cross your girlfriend's boundary if you were going to do what you planned regardless of what option you picked. \n\nHonestly, she deserves better. And you are a terrible boyfriend. You need to learn how to empathize and stop doing everything your mom says. You ALSO should respect your girlfriend enough to consider her feelings and do what's best for YALL not your mom.", "This story is super confusing. \n\nYour mom won't allow you to drive on heavy traffic day? So you're not okay with your gf telling you what to do, but okay with mommy telling what to do? \n\nAnd if she wants to come along, what's the problem?   Why can't you wait and drive with her, even if it's on heavy traffic and you'll spend 2 less? What's the big deal? \n\nAnd what the deal with T? Is she also coming to your family Easter? You didn't say it outright, but it's implied. Why is she driving 6-7 hours with you? \nAnd why your gf haven't met her yet? \n\nIt sounds like your mom is trying spesficly for you come with T instead of with your gf and you're falling for it.", "YTA - grow up. Talking to your mother and getting her opinion is one thing, but you need to think critically for yourself.", "YTA - good lord I hope ur girlfriend realizes it and leaves you", "YTA! \n\nNo one likes a mummy's boy", "Bro wtf. You're 28, not 8. All your mum needs to know is when you're arriving, with whom and for how long. You don't need her permission or approval for anything outside her own home. Get your shit together and grow up. YTA.", "YTA. If this keeps up your girlfriend won't be around much longer.", "YTA- you are aware that your sister is unpleasant(not honest, unpleasant) and rather than telling her to start being more polite, you told your GF to grow a thicker skin. Your mother is controlling and you overshare. You are consistently choosing them over your GF. You are 'respecting' your mother's wishes and leaving your GF to have Easter alone because your mother won't let you drive on another day. \n\nYou're married to your family. Cut this poor girl loose because she will never be a priority over your mom and your rude sister.", "YTA. And pathetic. Cut the umbilical cord man. This reeks of emotional incest.", "If youGF has reddit, can you give me her name? I'd really love to tell her what a wast of space you are and to aim higher.", "YTA you are in the FOG, you are a momma's boy. No GF likes momma's boy.  Why don't you go look on the JNMIL and see how many people take their mom's side over their partners side.   You need to listen to your girlfriend, because she is right. So many red flags her on your part not on hers. You remind me of the guy that got caught by his wife at their wedding in the closet getting breastfed from his mother.", "YTA your relationship with your mother is codependent to the point of being toxic.", "YTA, so you think your girlfriend is controlling but you need your mommy\u2019s permission on when to drive? You\u2019re never going to have a healthy relationship as long as you let mommy control your life.", "Yta. Put your pants on a sort yourself out.", "YTA\n\nHow have you been together for 4 years and she\u2019s never met this girl friend of yours?", "YTA... Your girlfriend's not controlling, your Mom is. The audacity to think she has more say over your holiday that is to be shared with your girlfriend than your girlfriend does... And the audacity of you to give her more say. You should just stay with your Mom and let this poor girl dodge a bullet. Heaven forbid you guys have kids together. Next thing you know your mom will be calling them her kids, calling CPS on your girlfriend and you'll be supporting it \ud83e\udd22", "ROFL - you want to drive 'home to mommy' with your friend 'T' who presumably will do all the driving and go back with you GF , who will presumably also do the driving for this long trip.  Both women will drive solo for one leg and you will pay less than either as your contribution to fuel\n\nI bet you listen to you mother when it suits you and it suits you in this case.  It saves you cash on fuel?  How cheap areyou !  'Respecting your mothers wishes' - I bet you pull that chestnut out when it suits you!!\n\nI can only imagine what goes on in your mothers house at Christmas!  \n\nI think GF needs to spend more time with her own friends and family.  She should avoid you and your mother and that strange dynamic.  Any man who calls his mother on a daily basis and tells her everything ALREADY has a GF\n\nGF isn't controlling - she is confused and thinks you need to be saved from your strange relationship with your mother but GF doesn't know you embrace this and she will never convience you its strange\n\nYTA", "I\u2019d break up with your mamas boy ass. YTA grow tf up", "You are 28 years old. You don't mom's permission to drive. Do want an adult relationship or not. Go to therapy to cut those apron strings.\n\nYta", "YTA - why is your mom dictating your relationship. Fix that before she leaves you mama's boy.", "YTA I bet your mom is using this to create a rift between you and your girlfriend- and mommy knows you well and how to manipulate you because it\u2019s working. I honestly have no idea why your girlfriend is still with you after being disrespected by your family and you since you don\u2019t choose her or stand up for her. I really hope she comes to her senses and leaves you to mommy and whoever she picks for you", "YTA. You don\u2019t even sound like you like your girlfriend. She deserves better than a mommy\u2019s boy who can\u2019t even make his own decisions at 28.", "YTA\n\nNothing I hate more than a mother's boy. Holy OP, you need to grow a spine and stop being so freaking weird. Next you're gonna ask her if you have her permission to have sex!", "Yta", "ESH\n\n>But my mum won't allow me to drive on our pre-arranged day because of the horrible traffic\n\nYou're 28, dude. She doesn't get to decide.\n\n>I told her this and she responded, verbatim \"Why do you need your mother's permission to not drive with this woman? You're 28 and a grown man, I don't get it.\"\r  \n\r\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nIf you want to decide to leave with T, do, but don't be cowardly and blame your mum. It's YOUR decision.\n\n>My girlfriend flat out told me that she doesn't want me going with that woman, and that this is a boundary she's putting.\n\nShe sucks too. It's ridiculous to try set the boundary on who you're allowed to drive with.\n\n\"You can't hang out with this woman\" isn't a healthy boundary you can set, it's controlling as all hell.", "YTAA, how can you not see that your mom\u2018s behavior is controlling? You see it as being respectful, so are willing to show your mom more respect than your girlfriend, when we can all see that your mom is being very controlling for a 28 year old baby man", "Oh  lol", "You couldn't leave early the following morning so that M could do her workshop *and* go with you?\n\nYTA.", "YTA FULL STOP! \n\nYour mum can express concern over driving in traffic and make the suggestion of driving with the friend but she has no right to stop a grown ass man making his own decision on when he will drive. \n\nYour consideration should be to your girlfriend and not your mother, otherwise just buy a ring and ask your mum to marry you. Ffs. \n\nYou told your girlfriend she\u2019s too controlling but have no issue with your mum controlling you??? What a joke.", "Yup. Wonder why the gf feels like an outcast...", "8 year old would be closer to the behavior", "Yup", "I've seen at least 6 hallmark movies with this exact plot point.", "In this case, since OP warned GF about one specific family member not that all of them sling insults as joke, I think thick skinned just means no one is willing to call her out on her assholery for fear of \"rocking the boat\" and to \"keep the peace\"", "For sure. I'm not saying the opposite", "They are asking op to think what he would feel if it was a male friend of his gf. They know it's a female friend.", "Don't say that, most 16 year olds are more rebellious than OP", "A 16 year old would be more likely to defy mommy than this dude.", "quadrangle, mom is trying to play matchmaker for son & T", "That's what really gets me. If she's such a close friend, wouldn't he want to introduce his partner to her right away?\nI introduced my gf to my gaming buddies after like a month, let alone close friends.", "and apparently lives close enough to swing by and pick OP up before an 8 hour drive.", "and takes him for ice cream after if he had to get a shot", "Saw them live in Boston once, good show"]}
