Partially from how my sister in law treated her over Christmas. M didn't feel welcomed by my family and felt like an outcast.\n\nI can have empathy with her sentiment. Because my sister in law is a very honest person, and she doesn't really sugar coat stuff. I told her (and warned her) that my family can be thick skinned, unemotional and practical.\n\nShe also has a problem with my relationship with my mother. She says I overshare. And I will admit, I do talk to my mum about almost everything. But that's because she was my support system growing up, and it's just always been like that. I am who I am today because of her.\n\nNow, on to the main problem. M and I was supposed to visit my mum during Easter. But my girlfriend has to run a workshop for her company.\n\nThis workshop means a lot to M, and can really boost her career. But if we leave after her workshop, we will be driving when the road is at it's busiest on Easter. Its a 6-7 hour drive.\n\nMy mom suggested that I leave with a friend (28, F) (\"T\") the day before the workshop to avoid all that traffic. We will avoid traffic and save some cash on fuel costs. And then I will return with her after 5 days. \n\nWhen I told M about the new arrangements, she got upset because she haven't met T yet. T is an old highschool friend of mine that M just didn't have an opportunity to meet yet. She also asked me to let her come along, that she doesn't want to spend easter alone (she's not close to her family).\n\nShe also said that if I went on my own, I could stay longer (a whole week) instead of just 5 days with T.\n\nI called my mum to ask her opinion. But my mum won't allow me to drive on our pre-arranged day because of the horrible traffic. She just wants me to be safe and drive with T. Which is completely reasonable, I think.\n\n\nI told her this and she responded, verbatim \"Why do you need your mother's permission to not drive with this woman? You're 28 and a grown man, I don't get it.\" \n\nI told her its not about my friend, but about respecting my mothers wishes.\n\nMy girlfriend flat out told me that she doesn't want me going with that woman, and that this is a boundary she's putting.\n\nI get boundaries but I have never restricted her of spending time with her male friends. I told her she's way too controlling, and that this isn't a big deal. And that I won't allow her to stop me from spending time with family members.\n\nBut she started crying and shut herself in the spare bedroom. She's avoiding me and giving me the cold shoulder. She hasn't slept in our bed ever since, and it's been a few days since this happened.

She's clearly the controlling one at your age.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nGF isn't wrong. You're a grown ass man. You don't need to run to your mommy for every decision. It's reasonable for your GF not to feel comfortable with your mom's proposal. Whether true or not, it comes off as your mom would prefer you were with your friend than with your gf. Especially if they already don't seem to get along.", "YTA, not only you are willing to leave your GF on her own on a very important event, you actually treat your mother's words as more important. I wouldn't want to have a life with a person, who will always be a momma boy and do as she pleases disregarding the relationship with SO.

It seems like mom doesn't approve of M and wants you to bring T. But you're 28, I'm pretty sure you can drive yourself safely to your mother's house. \n\n\nI think M just feels a type of way bc you're gonna leave her on Easter bc she has to work to go spend 5 days with a girl your mom obviously prefers over her. She's not over emotional or anything. If she was close with her family and they said \"oh your bf can't make it? Bring a different man and come stay with us anyway with this 2nd man.\" It's weird. It'd be different if you went alone but the addition of another girl is weird.", "YTA.

I don't think you are as rational as you think you are. You are just doing what your mother wants, rather than what is rational. You think you going with T and avoiding bad traffic is reasonable but to me it looks like an emotional decision designed to cut out M who your mother dislikes. Basically if your mother says it's good or bad you think it's rational or reasonable but you presume your GFs decisions are emotional.\n\nI suspect the problem will be solved soon because your gf will break up with you (and with good reason) but yeah, YTA.\n\nAnd look, I'm someone who is close to her mother, so I get that. But what you are describing goes way beyond that. You aren't just over sharing, you also seem to be completely reliant on your mother to make decisions, and don't seem to be able to decide what you want. And that won't just be a problem for M, but for most partners.", "YTA. Your gf is right. You're an adult and can choose how you're going to travel. This whole situation sounds weird, like your gf isn't invited amd you're leaving her alone. Your mother for whatever reason really wants you to go with T because of \"Easter traffic\", which let's be honest is hardly any worse than usual traffic, it's not even a 3 day weekend. To me it sounds like your mother is trying to set you up with T but idk enough about the background to honestly make that assumption.", "YTA - your girlfriend is completely right. At 28 years old, why do you need your mother to tell you how to get to Easter? You decide what is important and do that. \n\nIf you are happy with your girlfriend, who has no family, being alone for the holiday so you can beat traffic, do it. But don\u2019t try to blame your mother like it\u2019s her decision.\n\nAlso, you rushed her away from spending time with her father who had a stroke. Just break up.

You brush this off as them being \u201cthick skinned.\u201d\n\n2. You over share personal details with your mom. Assuming this includes about your relationship, which your girlfriend has expressed discomfort with. Probably because she values her privacy, and you\u2019re not respecting that. \n\n3. Your mom is somehow forcing you to drive on a different day, with another woman, and leave your girlfriend behind. Taking advantage of your girlfriend\u2019s work commitment to try and get you to come along and drive a wedge between you and the GF she\u2019s treated badly in the last. \n\n4. Your GF asks, reasonably, why a 28 year old man needs his mommy\u2019s permission to travel, when and with whom. \n\nThis is clearly not about controlling you. It\u2019s about your family disrespecting her at every turn, and now clearly trying to set you up with someone else and leave her behind, and your complete lack of backbone.

Today is the day you grow up and start making your own decisions.\n\nYour GF is rightly frustrated because you seem incapable of traveling by yourself as an adult, and probably is irritated that your solution to your overbearing mother isn't to tell her to BUTT OUT but to catch a ride with some lady she doesn't know because you're too passive to assert your independence from your mother.", "Info: Why are you asking us when you're just going to do what your mom tells you to do?", "YTA, grow up and act like a man.

If he had to keep asking if he is AH...he is an AH.", "Because the only workshop a woman could possibly be running is for a crappy MLM? \ud83d\ude44", "'get her out now' like she's a child jesus christ", "I admit I missed the part where she was running the workshop. So perhaps it is not.  \nThis was a lot of words and frankly kinda confusing.", "You clearly have never known anyone to lose thousands in an MLM", "oh please how the fuck do you know and even then it would give me no right to treat them as if they are a small child", "Found the hun", "no trust me i do hate mlm schemes and i think they're ridiculous and scam people out of lots of money but adults are allowed to be adults and he would have no right to stop her doing anything, plus the fact you jumped straight to her being part of an mlm instead of a business owner tells me a lot", "And I fully admitted that I missed the part where she was running the workshop. Therefore, I admitted that I could\u2019ve been wrong. Did you miss that part too? \nAnd yes, I do believe as her boyfriend and someone that possibly could marry her someday something involving financials. He definitely has a say in. Or are you one of those people that everything a separate and your money is your money?", "yes i am one of those people actually because i've seen the alternative growing up with a father that controlled everything and used that against my mother but i don't think that has anything to do with it, they aren't married and there's no mention of them sharing finances so therefore he has no say plus it sounds like she'll be breaking up with him soon anyway", "There\u2019s a difference between being controlling and actually sharing in a marriage. Your experience isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s experience and yeah, I hope she does break up with him because he\u2019s a whiny baby who needs to cut the cord."]}
