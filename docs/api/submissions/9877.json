He is currently taking classes online to earn a business degree. He has been with his current and first time girlfriend \u2018Tonya\u2019 (24f) for 2 years. \n\nTonya is also in college, goes to a local brick and mortar. As I understood a few months ago, Tonya gave my son a brand new Xbox series X which was a bit odd to me. It\u2019s important to note as Tonya\u2019s birthday approached, I gave Eli $200 to put towards a decent gift for her since she randomly gave him something expensive. Fast forward a few weeks, Tonya abruptly stopped coming over. They are adults, so neither my wife or myself pressed him as to why. \n\nEventually, Tonya calls my wife to explain that Eli is refusing to return her Xbox. She was a bit confused, Tonya said they didn\u2019t break up but had a fight before she asked for the Xbox back. She also claimed it was never a gift. We spoke to Eli, he assured us it was absolutely a gift as it was even wrapped. I felt they needed to figure things out on their own. \n\nLast weekend, Tonya came over and approached me in our garage. My son and wife weren\u2019t home at the time. She had explained everything, then handed me her phone to read their text history. To summarize, one of Tonya\u2019s three roommates stole from her. Two days later, the Xbox she had purchased was delivered. Fearing it would get stolen, she asked my son to hold onto it for safekeeping until she found a new place to live. \n\nAs a direct quote, \u201cI haven\u2019t even opened it yet, just sucks I\u2019m living with a thief. When I come over, let\u2019s set it up so at least you can use it.\u201d He acknowledged everything she had said. Aside from the entire Xbox ordeal, the more I read the more livid I became. The things my son said to her, speaking to her in such an extremely condescending manner. I was mortified, this is not the son I raised.\n\nI took her into his room and packed up the Xbox. I was in shock to learn about this side of my son I never knew existed. I was asking questions and learned the fight started after he forgot her birthday. Days later, she was very hurt and confronted him. In return, he tossed her a wrinkled up shirt that had a $10 price tag on it. She did so much for his birthday, helped his mom decorate and throw him a party. \n\nThey arrived home a few hours after she left. He just stepped over the threshold and I went off on him. It\u2019s not like I can discipline him anymore, but I damn sure wanted him to feel shame and guilt for his appalling behavior. He kept saying that I didn\u2019t understand, she\u2019s only telling her side. When I informed him the Xbox was gone, he completely threw a 5 year old tantrum. He called me a \u2018fucktard\u2019 and said I had no business getting involved in his personal relationship. \n\nHis mother agreed with him and asked what happened to them figuring things out on their own? Legally, she could have just gotten the law involved. Three days later he put a keyed lock on his door.

Your son is in the wrong.\n\nYour wife is enabling his behavior, which is something you two should communicate with each other about.\n\nETA: If they are adults who can \"figure it out on their own\", then they should act like it. Your son is acting like a kid, perhaps he should be treated like one in this scenario. If he can't act like an adult at the age of 23, it may be necessary for you to get involved so he can take some accountability for his actions before it turns into a lawsuit.", "NTA.\n\nIf he took your $200 and bought her a $10 t-shirt, then he's clearly capable of making up a story about it being a birthday gift.\n\nShe didn't just \"tell her side\" she showed you the texts.", "NTA\n\nThis was completely deserved, and you did your son (and yourself and your wife) a favor by keeping the police out of it.", "Was ready to say you were the AH based on the title, but after reading everything I would say NTA. Your son is a major AH and is a liar and thief (he tried stealing the xbox from Tonya,  and he pocketed $190 of the $200 you gave him to spend on a gift for Tonya).  Contrary to your wife's assertion,  Tonya tried to work it out between her and your son, but that got her nowhere when your son refused to give it back.  She only involved you as a last resort.  If you didn't help get her Xbox back,  which she was rightfully owed,  she could've started legal action against your son. Frankly I think you deserve props for acting like a good parent.", "NTA, possession of stolen property is illegal. You should tell your wife and print it for your son to read. What a child...", "NTA....You had stayed out of it until Tonya came over and talked to you directly. On top of it, she showed you the text exchanges between her and your son.   \nI would tell him to remove the lock from his door. If he doesn't pay rent, than that room is still yours.", "I may get shredded for this but NTA. Letting them \u201cfigure things out on their own\u201d should not include theft of property, and the possibility of a lawsuit. Disability or no, your son is acting like a selfish, sexist, immature jerk\u2026and it\u2019s time for him to be kicked out of the nest. The audacity of him putting a lock on a door *in your house* should\u2019ve been a clue that it\u2019s time for you to make him leave\u2014with a heavy dose of tough love. You\u2019re not helping him, you\u2019re enabling him.", "NTA. Your son lied about how he came about the XBox and is showing his true colours about how he treats people as evidenced by how he spoke to you and Tonya. You might not have raised him like this but unfortunately you can do your best and still raise children whose ethics and morals don't align with yours (though if his mother is on his side then that might be where he gets it from).\n\nTonya sent the Xbox to him thinking that she could trust him and he broke that trust. Getting the law involved doesn't mean she's going to get results or that her items will be any more safe.\n\nOver and above giving the XBox back, I would also tell him you want your $200 back.", "NTA, she did figure it out as an adult. She tried to work it out with him and then took proof to you as a next step. The step after that would have been the police. Seems pretty open and shut to me. Your son just does not like the consequences of his actions.", "NTA. Tell your wife and son that he's lucky she brought her evidence to you instead of the police.", "INFO: Are you sure this isn\u2019t the son you raised? These actions and his responses don\u2019t come out of nowhere. \n\nHe may be 23 but have you spoken to him about getting a remote job while he\u2019s studying? Or even someone kind of remote internship? They\u2019re all over LinkedIn. \n\nIt sounds like he has no real responsibilities and you even gave him money to help fund his girlfriend\u2019s birthday (at 23 yrs old too). \n\nIt sounds like he\u2019s always had his parents (you) take care of everything for him. There are many ways that jobs and internships can accommodate his disability, does he know how to research that and be armed with the information he needs? \n\nI\u2019m not saying he needs to move out (lord knows in this housing crisis) but it sounds like the ball was dropped when helping to guide him to independence. \n\nSo NTA for what you did but you may be the asshole for what you\u2019ve helped create.", "NTA\n\nCan you contact Tonya and ask her to send screen crabs of the messages to you and show them to your wife? Aside his attempts of stealing her xbox, they way he spoke to her in the texts. And ask her if she's OK with your son talking to women in that wat, and should you leave him alone about it?", "NTA-She handled it like an adult. Your son lied, was a thief and acted like a child when you addressed his behavior.", "NTA your son is a thief. Your wife is ok with this. Is that new or has she always enabled this self centered behavior in him?", "NTA\n\nSeems like once all of the evidence came out, it is pretty clear that she did not give him the Xbox, she was just keeping it at your house, and with that established, giving it back was the right thing to do.  As far as disciplining him, your right that he is a little old for that, but you are well within your lane to express to him how upset you are with the way he behaved, and even though he's an adult, he does still live in your house, so he needs to show some respect.\n\nINFO- You said your wife is agreeing with him... does she think he should have kept the Xbox even though it was clear from the texts that it was not a gift?  What does she think about him forgetting her birthday and all of that?", "I'm gonna go with NTA. \n\nHe lied, he tried to steal/keep something that was just given to him for safekeeping (quite ironic), treated his girlfriend like crap, ***and you saw the written evidence!***\n\nI'd freak out at that, too. Your son is also incorrect in that you only saw her side, we are talking about back-and-forth texts. \n\nYour wife may think her baby can do no wrong, but he is a man by now, and he needs to experience the consequences of his actions, which - in this case - hopefully means his girlfriend breaking up with him. \n\nOn the other hand, it's also perfectly okay of him to get a lock for his door. I can't say how doting you and your wife were as parents before, so while his behaviour towards his girlfriend was bad, you going off on him and taking away the Xbox might actually feel like a breach of trust to him.\n\nBut overall, I don't think that's how a mentally sound 23-year-old should act and react.", "NTA.  You saved your son from potentially facing criminal charges.", "NTA and he owes you $190.\n\nAlso, if you had let him keep this, you would\u2019ve also been committing a crime. Accessory after the fact. \n\nThose texts would\u2019ve stood up in court.\n\nYour son - is he usually this enabled by mom? Does she usually coddle him like that after he\u2019s clearly in the wrong? \n\nIf at all possible, ask for a copy of the texts again. Show your wife, explain to her with the evidence before her. She may have some kind of rose colored glasses on aboht your son.", "NTA, and if my kid put a lock on their bedroom door in my house without my permission, they'd lose the whole door.", "NTA, he would be out of my home by month\u2019s end.", "NTA.  Whilst your son would ordinarily be right to say you have no right to involve yourself in his personal relationship, he waived that right when he brought what amounts to stolen goods onto your property, effectively putting you in the crossfire of his relationship issues.  \n\nUltimately you may need to assert your rights as the homeowner if your son continues to be abusive to you and to other women - he may have a physical disability but that doesn\u2019t unconditionally entitle him to live in your home.  That\u2019s one for the future though - for now, you\u2019re definitely NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour son acted in poor judgment and taste. He showed he can't figure it out on his own with Tanya as he's acting like a child and holding property that you clearly read was not his.", "NTA- yea this is the time to squash his behavior before this solidified- I\u2019m glad she was confident enough to confide in you OP about the situation. And proud to know guys like you keep their kids in check. He\u2019s manipulating the situation to y\u2019all so that he can keep a gaming system? The entitled little B\u2026", "NTA. Your son behaved terribly. You corrected a wrong. Think it is time to explain house rules to your son if he is going to stay with you.", "NTA. Your a good father and protecting a young adult girl from a bad and possibly future abusive relationship. It sounds like your son is manipulative and lies to his girlfriend. Kudos to you for protecting that girl and possibly your future son from getting involed with the police for stolen property. If you son doesn't like it, he can move out. There are plenty of physically disabled people that live alone and thrive.", "NTA\n\nThough personally if my wife and kid acted like this I'd help the gf call the police and go that route :3 Now you're handling it like adults. :)", ">I was mortified, this is not the son I raised.\n\nSpoiler, it is.\n\nNTA and good luck with your shitty adult son who's still living in your house and throwing tantrums.", "NTA.
