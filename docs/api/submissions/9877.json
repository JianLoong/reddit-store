He is currently taking classes online to earn a business degree. He has been with his current and first time girlfriend \u2018Tonya\u2019 (24f) for 2 years. \n\nTonya is also in college, goes to a local brick and mortar. As I understood a few months ago, Tonya gave my son a brand new Xbox series X which was a bit odd to me. It\u2019s important to note as Tonya\u2019s birthday approached, I gave Eli $200 to put towards a decent gift for her since she randomly gave him something expensive. Fast forward a few weeks, Tonya abruptly stopped coming over. They are adults, so neither my wife or myself pressed him as to why. \n\nEventually, Tonya calls my wife to explain that Eli is refusing to return her Xbox. She was a bit confused, Tonya said they didn\u2019t break up but had a fight before she asked for the Xbox back. She also claimed it was never a gift. We spoke to Eli, he assured us it was absolutely a gift as it was even wrapped. I felt they needed to figure things out on their own. \n\nLast weekend, Tonya came over and approached me in our garage. My son and wife weren\u2019t home at the time. She had explained everything, then handed me her phone to read their text history. To summarize, one of Tonya\u2019s three roommates stole from her. Two days later, the Xbox she had purchased was delivered. Fearing it would get stolen, she asked my son to hold onto it for safekeeping until she found a new place to live. \n\nAs a direct quote, \u201cI haven\u2019t even opened it yet, just sucks I\u2019m living with a thief. When I come over, let\u2019s set it up so at least you can use it.\u201d He acknowledged everything she had said. Aside from the entire Xbox ordeal, the more I read the more livid I became. The things my son said to her, speaking to her in such an extremely condescending manner. I was mortified, this is not the son I raised.\n\nI took her into his room and packed up the Xbox. I was in shock to learn about this side of my son I never knew existed. I was asking questions and learned the fight started after he forgot her birthday. Days later, she was very hurt and confronted him. In return, he tossed her a wrinkled up shirt that had a $10 price tag on it. She did so much for his birthday, helped his mom decorate and throw him a party. \n\nThey arrived home a few hours after she left. He just stepped over the threshold and I went off on him. It\u2019s not like I can discipline him anymore, but I damn sure wanted him to feel shame and guilt for his appalling behavior. He kept saying that I didn\u2019t understand, she\u2019s only telling her side. When I informed him the Xbox was gone, he completely threw a 5 year old tantrum. He called me a \u2018fucktard\u2019 and said I had no business getting involved in his personal relationship. \n\nHis mother agreed with him and asked what happened to them figuring things out on their own? Legally, she could have just gotten the law involved. Three days later he put a keyed lock on his door.

Contrary to your wife's assertion,  Tonya tried to work it out between her and your son, but that got her nowhere when your son refused to give it back.  She only involved you as a last resort.

You\u2019re not helping him, you\u2019re enabling him.", "NTA.

You might not have raised him like this but unfortunately you can do your best and still raise children whose ethics and morals don't align with yours (though if his mother is on his side then that might be where he gets it from).\n\nTonya sent the Xbox to him thinking that she could trust him and he broke that trust.

Or even someone kind of remote internship? They\u2019re all over LinkedIn. \n\nIt sounds like he has no real responsibilities and you even gave him money to help fund his girlfriend\u2019s birthday (at 23 yrs old too). \n\nIt sounds like he\u2019s always had his parents (you) take care of everything for him. There are many ways that jobs and internships can accommodate his disability, does he know how to research that and be armed with the information he needs? \n\nI\u2019m not saying he needs to move out (lord knows in this housing crisis) but it sounds like the ball was dropped when helping to guide him to independence. \n\nSo NTA for what you did but you may be the asshole for what you\u2019ve helped create.", "NTA\n\nCan you contact Tonya and ask her to send screen crabs of the messages to you and show them to your wife?

Is that new or has she always enabled this self centered behavior in him?", "NTA\n\nSeems like once all of the evidence came out, it is pretty clear that she did not give him the Xbox, she was just keeping it at your house, and with that established, giving it back was the right thing to do.  As far as disciplining him, your right that he is a little old for that, but you are well within your lane to express to him how upset you are with the way he behaved, and even though he's an adult, he does still live in your house, so he needs to show some respect.\n\nINFO- You said your wife is agreeing with him... does she think he should have kept the Xbox even though it was clear from the texts that it was not a gift?  What does she think about him forgetting her birthday and all of that?", "I'm gonna go with NTA. \n\nHe lied, he tried to steal/keep something that was just given to him for safekeeping (quite ironic), treated his girlfriend like crap, ***and you saw the written evidence!***\n\nI'd freak out at that, too. Your son is also incorrect in that you only saw her side, we are talking about back-and-forth texts. \n\nYour wife may think her baby can do no wrong, but he is a man by now, and he needs to experience the consequences of his actions, which - in this case - hopefully means his girlfriend breaking up with him. \n\nOn the other hand, it's also perfectly okay of him to get a lock for his door. I can't say how doting you and your wife were as parents before, so while his behaviour towards his girlfriend was bad, you going off on him and taking away the Xbox might actually feel like a breach of trust to him.\n\nBut overall, I don't think that's how a mentally sound 23-year-old should act and react.", "NTA.  You saved your son from potentially facing criminal charges.", "NTA and he owes you $190.\n\nAlso, if you had let him keep this, you would\u2019ve also been committing a crime.

Whilst your son would ordinarily be right to say you have no right to involve yourself in his personal relationship, he waived that right when he brought what amounts to stolen goods onto your property, effectively putting you in the crossfire of his relationship issues.  \n\nUltimately you may need to assert your rights as the homeowner if your son continues to be abusive to you and to other women - he may have a physical disability but that doesn\u2019t unconditionally entitle him to live in your home.  That\u2019s one for the future though - for now, you\u2019re definitely NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour son acted in poor judgment and taste.

Your son was keeping a stolen item in your home. He and your wife should be glad Tonya came to you instead of the police.", "You let your son speak to you that way? I\u2019m almost 40 years old and even in a fit of rage in my teenage years I have NEVER swore at my parents. NTA but you need to discipline him better even in his 20s..", "NTA it was either you return it or call the police.\n\nAlso why havent you asked for the 190$ back since you gave him 200$ for a gift for her and he only used 20$.\n\nAlso its your house -he cant install a keypad you dont have the ability to open- you need to remove it immediately", "I learned from having my wallet stolen that, in my state, felony is over $500.  The thieves spent just over $490 on my credit cards in a matter of less than two hours and then stopped using them.  I asked the cop I reported the theft to about that and he said these were clearly experienced thieves because they knew to stop before hitting the felony threshold.", "Yup, I wonder where that $200 went if he \u201cforgot\u201d her birthday.", "The manosphere was my first thought too. NTA OP but your son needs serious help for his misogynistic and abusive/predatory tendencies.", "INFO: Did you tell your wife about the texts and the T-shirt? Seems insane she'd side with your son when you saw literal proof he was lying to you.", "I feel everyone else has covered the gf situation but are skipping right over the \"he put a keyed lock on his door\" part. Like all types of fuck no. 23 yo, steals from his gf and you, tantrum, thinks he can do whatever in your house...hell naw.", "NTA.  He lied and tried to steal.  You need to be prepared for his behavior to get worse, your wife is enabling him.  If he has a physical disability that's limiting him from independent living you need to look for a supportive group home.  Not throw him out, but be ready if his lying and stealing continues.  This will turn your him into a battlefield and knowing you have a backup plan helps.", "NTA. If you hadn\u2019t stepped in, your son could be facing legal trouble. And there would inevitably be a AITA post from Tonya\u2019s point of view. \u201cMy boyfriend stole from me and his parents enable him. AITA for calling the cops?\u201d\n\nYou should ask Tonya to kindly send you some of the screenshots from her conversations with your son. Show them to you wife. Have a discussion about it.  Then show then show them your son together. And have another discussion.", "NTA", "NTA. Him continuing to live with you should be contingent on him going to therapy. This behavior is unacceptable.", "NTA\n\n\nThe the most expensive $10 dollar shirt your $200 went into", "NTA. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Your wife though? Ooof. Definite AH for not giving two shits that her son is a theif. Was she so quick to overlook his wrongdoings as a child? Because that would explain a lot. \n\nIf I were you, I'd be waiting for the dust to settle and I'd be having a long talk with him about the way he treats women and why he thinks any of what he did was okay. Then I'd ask your wife the same questions. The fence sitting has to stop, especially when it's enabling a theif and a misogynist.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Idk how your son turned out so poorly if you have such a high moral standing. Maybe it's the babying mum does? Why are you letting your adult son put locks on doors in YOUR home?", "NTA. I would have slapped him into the next house.", "NTA she showed you evidence it belonged to her. It was absolutely right to give it back.", "I mean, as told here, NTA. \n\nBUT.\n\nBUUUUUUUT. I'd try to get ahold of your son's texts just to be 100% sure she didn't show you fabricated messages. Just saying. It wouldn't be that hard for her to have a friend text her that conversation back and forth and change the contact name. So just try to be extra certain that her story lines up IMO.\n\nFrom your son's reaction I'm inclined to side with the ex but JUST IN CASE..", "NTA.  \nAnd I would not allow the lock on his door after he has shown that he cannot be trusted. If he wants privacy, he can move out. I understand that there may be some concerns regarding his disability, but you mentioned that is only \"partially\" the reason he still lives at home.", "NTA she showed proof that he's being childish and treating her poorly and she had grounds to go to rhe law if she wanted your son deserves to be single to be fair", "If removing an item he stole in order to *return it to its rightful owner* feels like a breach of trust, it's pretty clear (as indeed it sounds from the post) that they've got much bigger issues to deal with than one Xbox.", "My parents supported me all the way to 23 and I did not turn out a thief, actually. What a shitty connection you try to make.", "Oh my gosh, fake texts. Yeah right and if dad and asked to see them you\u2019d be on here saying he is violating his privacy and he has no right to see his phone.", "the son is folloeing the tate brothers advices  wich, not all of thrm are that good.\nop is NTA. and the girls showed thr convo between them regarding the xbox, so it was both sides. \nentitled son annd rude... :(", "It is called conversion, when you originally have legal possession of an item that belongs to someone else (like a rented item, for instance) that you keep that item when the permission to do so has ended.", "$250 here.", "NTA, The adult thing to do would be to report the xbox as stolen so your wife should be grateful you stepped in", "NTA.  That sON of yours is not a man, but he wants to be treated like one. Time for him to move out and make his own way in life.\n\nIt's the only way he'll learn. Different kids learn different ways, unfortunately for you, this kid needs it the hard way", "NTA. Your child is clearly still acting like that: a child. You will always be his parent and it seems like he needs to learn a few things about basic human decency, which you can help with.\n\nIf she hadn't come to you for help, maybe I'd say YTA. But no. She clearly exhausted every other option before doing so.", "NTA and he doesn\u2019t have. The right it put a keyed lock on his bedroom door. It\u2019s not his home,  he\u2019s a legal adult and you allow him to stay there. Having said that,  I would not have gotten involved.", "NTA. That's got to be hard having a child who in his adulthood seems regressing. The only tactical error you made was not bringing in your wife before this confrontation, I understand this was an emotional outburst. \n\nShe may or may not be deluded about his behavior but she hasn't been given a chance. Although she might not be giving you a chance either.\n\nI would recommend you continue doing right. Try to take the high ground and don't do anything dramatic. He can learn from this.", "I can\u2019t believe your wife isn\u2019t with you on this. It honestly sounds like your son has some issues that need to be worked on. NTA, you did the right thing.", "NTA. You and your wife need to agree on what type of young man you'll be giving the world. If she can read the messages and still stand by your son...might be time to look at her and what she's been teaching him.", "NTA. I\u2019d also be asking for the \u00a3190 back as he didn\u2019t spend it on his gf and it was money given to him for that purpose. \n\nI\u2019d also suggest you talk to him about house rules. Swearing at you, having stolen items in the house should be breaking them. I\u2019d tell him if he does so again he\u2019ll be out. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s been  coddled because of his disability. Time to stop and help him grow up", "NTA but your son certainly is sorry you have to deal with that it sounds bad", "NTA- what did he do with $190? Cheap man.", "NTA\n\nP.S.  It's your house.  If you don't want a keyed lock on the door, he can't have a keyed lock on the door.  (Normally, I'm all for privacy and boundaries for adult children, but your son's behavior has been so awful -- keeping stolen property in your house, not returning it, taking the $200 from you and not using for his GF as planned, lying, calling you foul names -- that I'm not cutting him a whole lot of slack.)", "Lock on the door? Looks like rent is due on the first. \n\nNTA but your son is a loser and I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  You're a good dad.", "NTA and while your son is under your roof he can pay you back the $200 and remove the lock.", "NTA. Also putting a lock on his bedroom is out of bounds. Feel free to remove the door. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he can move out.", "Yup, wife needs to stop coddling the son. She's doing him a HUGE disservice for later in life.", "This would be a civil matter settled thru small claims court. OPs son is in the wrong, but didn't come into possession via stealing, and the Xbox was not stolen to begin with by his GF.", "Not just that but maybe time for the son to start living on his own", "Yeah some people really have nice parents and act like this.. coming from a messed up family this hurts", "It\u2019s stolen property in his home\n\nShe could have gotten the police involved, caused OP a world of trouble \n\nAlso the son took 200 dollars from OP for her birthday and spent 10 dollars, so where is the other 190?", "The son didn\u2019t just steal the Xbox and keep stolen property in Ops house\n\nHe also took 200 dollars for the Gfs birthday and only used 10 of it\n\nHe knew the whole 200 was for the GFs birthday, so where did the other 190 go?\n\nThe son stole from OP as well", "AND the little idiot pocketed the 200 dollars that was meant for a bday present for his gf!", ">Since it was a \"loan\" I don't think they'd get far criminally.   \n>  \n>There has been some instances where a woman has loaned a bride a piece of jewelry that the bride then refuses to return.  And in several instances people have stated in comments that the police generally won't get involved.  \n>  \n>I forget the specific reasons.  Along the lines of he said/she said on whether it was a gift.  \n>  \n>After all Son could claim that despite the texts, later she said keep it as a gift, or he could claim he paid her for it in cash. etc etc", "I don't think this situation would qualify as theft so no criminal charges would be possible. It would be a civil matter settled thru court, a la Judge Judy.", "Yeah, it screams manosphere.", "Enough with the man hate.", "That reminds me of the time I decided to learn how to pick locks. I was home alone, bored, 7 or 8 years old. Went outside with some paperclips and locked the door. I either didn't consider getting back in, or I was certain I could pick the lock (can't quite remember).\n\nEventually managed to shimmy back in through an unlocked window. I later told my uncle the story, and he said, \"Yep, locks only keep out honest people.\" Which, true enough, but dickish implication to say that to a kid about their own house.", "Especially with the physical challenges this guy has (I didn't really clock what the deal was, so speaking generically), a lot of manosphere messaging is targeted towards those that aren't feeling... empowered, for lack of a better word.\n\nIt's very seductive when someone claims to understand one's difficulties and offers a \"way out\". Especially when the alternative is usually therapy and lots of hard work, it's daunting.\n\nI hope OP can find a way to communicate and bridge the gap here. Might already be too late though, the blowup and the lock speak to someone doubling-down and shutting down. OP needs to contact someone with deprogramming experience at this point.\n\nThe guy could just be a AH, especially since he's triangulating. If it's both, yikes."]}
