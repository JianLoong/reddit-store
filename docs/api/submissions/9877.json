He is currently taking classes online to earn a business degree. He has been with his current and first time girlfriend \u2018Tonya\u2019 (24f) for 2 years. \n\nTonya is also in college, goes to a local brick and mortar. As I understood a few months ago, Tonya gave my son a brand new Xbox series X which was a bit odd to me. It\u2019s important to note as Tonya\u2019s birthday approached, I gave Eli $200 to put towards a decent gift for her since she randomly gave him something expensive. Fast forward a few weeks, Tonya abruptly stopped coming over. They are adults, so neither my wife or myself pressed him as to why. \n\nEventually, Tonya calls my wife to explain that Eli is refusing to return her Xbox. She was a bit confused, Tonya said they didn\u2019t break up but had a fight before she asked for the Xbox back. She also claimed it was never a gift. We spoke to Eli, he assured us it was absolutely a gift as it was even wrapped. I felt they needed to figure things out on their own. \n\nLast weekend, Tonya came over and approached me in our garage. My son and wife weren\u2019t home at the time. She had explained everything, then handed me her phone to read their text history. To summarize, one of Tonya\u2019s three roommates stole from her. Two days later, the Xbox she had purchased was delivered. Fearing it would get stolen, she asked my son to hold onto it for safekeeping until she found a new place to live. \n\nAs a direct quote, \u201cI haven\u2019t even opened it yet, just sucks I\u2019m living with a thief. When I come over, let\u2019s set it up so at least you can use it.\u201d He acknowledged everything she had said. Aside from the entire Xbox ordeal, the more I read the more livid I became. The things my son said to her, speaking to her in such an extremely condescending manner. I was mortified, this is not the son I raised.\n\nI took her into his room and packed up the Xbox. I was in shock to learn about this side of my son I never knew existed. I was asking questions and learned the fight started after he forgot her birthday. Days later, she was very hurt and confronted him. In return, he tossed her a wrinkled up shirt that had a $10 price tag on it. She did so much for his birthday, helped his mom decorate and throw him a party. \n\nThey arrived home a few hours after she left. He just stepped over the threshold and I went off on him. It\u2019s not like I can discipline him anymore, but I damn sure wanted him to feel shame and guilt for his appalling behavior. He kept saying that I didn\u2019t understand, she\u2019s only telling her side. When I informed him the Xbox was gone, he completely threw a 5 year old tantrum. He called me a \u2018fucktard\u2019 and said I had no business getting involved in his personal relationship. \n\nHis mother agreed with him and asked what happened to them figuring things out on their own? Legally, she could have just gotten the law involved. Three days later he put a keyed lock on his door.

Contrary to your wife's assertion,  Tonya tried to work it out between her and your son, but that got her nowhere when your son refused to give it back.  She only involved you as a last resort.

You\u2019re not helping him, you\u2019re enabling him.", "NTA. Your son lied about how he came about the XBox and is showing his true colours about how he treats people as evidenced by how he spoke to you and Tonya. You might not have raised him like this but unfortunately you can do your best and still raise children whose ethics and morals don't align with yours (though if his mother is on his side then that might be where he gets it from).\n\nTonya sent the Xbox to him thinking that she could trust him and he broke that trust. Getting the law involved doesn't mean she's going to get results or that her items will be any more safe.\n\nOver and above giving the XBox back, I would also tell him you want your $200 back.", "NTA, she did figure it out as an adult.

Or even someone kind of remote internship? They\u2019re all over LinkedIn. \n\nIt sounds like he has no real responsibilities and you even gave him money to help fund his girlfriend\u2019s birthday (at 23 yrs old too). \n\nIt sounds like he\u2019s always had his parents (you) take care of everything for him. There are many ways that jobs and internships can accommodate his disability, does he know how to research that and be armed with the information he needs? \n\nI\u2019m not saying he needs to move out (lord knows in this housing crisis) but it sounds like the ball was dropped when helping to guide him to independence. \n\nSo NTA for what you did but you may be the asshole for what you\u2019ve helped create.", "NTA\n\nCan you contact Tonya and ask her to send screen crabs of the messages to you and show them to your wife?

Is that new or has she always enabled this self centered behavior in him?", "NTA\n\nSeems like once all of the evidence came out, it is pretty clear that she did not give him the Xbox, she was just keeping it at your house, and with that established, giving it back was the right thing to do.  As far as disciplining him, your right that he is a little old for that, but you are well within your lane to express to him how upset you are with the way he behaved, and even though he's an adult, he does still live in your house, so he needs to show some respect.\n\nINFO- You said your wife is agreeing with him... does she think he should have kept the Xbox even though it was clear from the texts that it was not a gift?  What does she think about him forgetting her birthday and all of that?", "I'm gonna go with NTA. \n\nHe lied, he tried to steal/keep something that was just given to him for safekeeping (quite ironic), treated his girlfriend like crap, ***and you saw the written evidence!***\n\nI'd freak out at that, too. Your son is also incorrect in that you only saw her side, we are talking about back-and-forth texts. \n\nYour wife may think her baby can do no wrong, but he is a man by now, and he needs to experience the consequences of his actions, which - in this case - hopefully means his girlfriend breaking up with him. \n\nOn the other hand, it's also perfectly okay of him to get a lock for his door. I can't say how doting you and your wife were as parents before, so while his behaviour towards his girlfriend was bad, you going off on him and taking away the Xbox might actually feel like a breach of trust to him.\n\nBut overall, I don't think that's how a mentally sound 23-year-old should act and react.", "NTA.  You saved your son from potentially facing criminal charges.", "NTA and he owes you $190.\n\nAlso, if you had let him keep this, you would\u2019ve also been committing a crime.

Whilst your son would ordinarily be right to say you have no right to involve yourself in his personal relationship, he waived that right when he brought what amounts to stolen goods onto your property, effectively putting you in the crossfire of his relationship issues.  \n\nUltimately you may need to assert your rights as the homeowner if your son continues to be abusive to you and to other women - he may have a physical disability but that doesn\u2019t unconditionally entitle him to live in your home.  That\u2019s one for the future though - for now, you\u2019re definitely NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour son acted in poor judgment and taste.

And he\u2019s upset at you?", "Felony or misdemeanor, theft is theft.\n\nEdit: or somehow became it", "No idea where OP is, would vary by country and if it's the US, varies by state.", "I literally already commented saying I missed that part on first read.", "Of course the gf was trying to avoid his son. The boy is obviously nuts and she was probably afraid of him twisting the situation. The father was correct in immediately giving her back her property.", "Dad should have told her it's between her and his son.", "OP you're NTA at all and thank you so much for standing up for what you saw as unacceptable behavior for him to talk to a woman let alone his gf. She wouldn't have gotten that Xbox back and it was so awful of him to do that to her let alone all the other stuff he did. If he spends a lot of time online he has potentially been ingesting redpill shit which is why he is acting this way but if he's living under your roof you decide the rules especially as you and your wife are both helping him with housing, school and all other costs. \n\nI really hope you can turn him around and get him on the right track, best of luck.", "NTA and it's so refreshing to see a parent holding their grown child accountable. I thought this post was gonna go a totally different direction, hopefully he learns and feels remorseful.", "NTA.\n\nAnd seeing as this is your house you can take the lock off if you were so inclined as well...", "Excuse me? A KEY LOCK?! No way he can pack his Shit and rent his own apartment and lock the door there. He\u2019s 23, stole from his gf, effectively emotionally abused her and then proceeded to put a lock on his bedroom door IN A HOUSE YOU OWN?! I\u2019m all for privacy of course, but this is out right retaliation to the fact that he\u2019s been caught out, made a fool of and is now saying a big \u201cf you I can put a lock on my door\u201d it would be taken straight the f off due to the fact he can\u2019t be trusted not to have stolen property hidden in his room NTA he\u2019s lucky she didn\u2019t get the police involved because I would have.", "NTA\nAlso, he stole from you. That $200 was for a gift for her. He owes you $190.", "NTA - and I would recommend removing the door to his room", "NTA Your property, YOUR call to give someone back their stolen property being stored there!", "NTA and oh my goodness I hope you are getting the $190 too! \n\nI\u2019m willing to bet everything he is being even more awful to her right now and blaming her rather than thinking about what he did wrong btw", "NTA. I would also ask your son what happened to the remaining $190 out of the $200 you gave to him to buy her a gift. He needs to pay it back.", "NTA, time for him to move out...", "NTA.  Poor girl, she has thieves all around her.  What a luck on her!", "NTA.  Unless is paying to live there, I would be taking that keypad off and telling him he needs to pay back the $19\u201d he kept.   Sounds like your son has a lot of problems.", "NTA. His mother agreed with him? Geez. No wonder he's grown up so spoilt and selfish.", "NTA. At that point it was stolen property. She had proof & could have decided to take legal action. It wasn't about \"their relationship\" -it was about returning stolen property.", "NTA, you\u2019re raising a thief and a misogynist and your wife is enabling him.", "NTA.\n\nIf your son and your wife want to continue blaming you, can you contact the gf and ask her to print out the messages between her and your son? He's lucky she didn't go to the piluce.", "NTA she stole it. I\u2019m wondering if it was he who stole from her too and not her roommates. If Elijah isn\u2019t paying rent then it\u2019s time to let that bird free. He is entitled and a thief.", "NTA. Your son should be living somewhere else, though. He is lying and manipulating everyone.", "NTA. Your son should be grateful she didn't call the police. He should also be repaying you that $200, since you gave it to him to buy a gift for her, and that's not what he did. Your son is probably going to need some real life consequences to change, and the best thing you could do for him is to hold him more accountable than you have done.", "NTA - you read the text message so you have proof of what the situation was. It was never gifted to him, so it didn't belong to him. He is also living under your roof too, which you have more say about the property in your house than he does. It also sounds like your son doesn't know you read the text, so not sure why he thinks you misunderstand anything. I am sorry that he is manipulative and treating his girlfriend so poorly. I am wondering what he used the money on since it wasn't for a girlfriend's gift. It sounds like there is a lot going on. Wishing you the best.", "NTA. Based on all this I have a feeling he could have been the person who stole from her since he had no problem stealing her Xbox", "Your son is a liar and a thief.  You might want to rethink his continuing to live with you.  NTA", "NTA. And I would  take that lock from the door.", "info does he pay rent ? \n\nNTA your son stole from her", "NTA and I would tell son of he steals anything else you will break the door to get it back.", "Kick him out.nta.", "Take the door off the hinges. You've got quite an entitled A on your hands.\n\nWhen you explained to your wife what he said and did to Tonya, what did she say?", "NTA. Your son not only claimed a $650 device as a gift to him when it wasn\u2019t, he also didn\u2019t spend the $200 you gave him on a gift for his girlfriend, the whole reason you gave it to him to begin with. Sounds like his days living with you are now numbered, since he can\u2019t be trusted to be honest with you.", "Why is the shirt so wrinkled? Did he steal it from the store? Just speculation, but that seems like an odd detail.", "Not only that but where did the $200 you gave him go if it didn\u2019t go to GF\u2019s birthday gift? My parents would have thrown me out if I acted the way Elijah did", "NTA you did well to allow the owner to reclaim her property. \n\nI am concerned about the lock on his door.  He stole from her lied to you about it easily.  Then you gave him money for the purpose of buying her a present which it seems he did not so he stole from you.  What other stolen things are in his room?\n\n I'm all for privacy but this is an adult who is very comfortable with lies and theft.  You do not want stolen items in your home.  I would be very surprised if this is his first theft.  \n\nThere are lots of kids who try stealing something,  or maybe a few things,  realize that it is wrong,  grow up and are trustworthy people. BUT THIS IS AN ADULT.", "Wish I could up vote this more than once...", "Stolen property was in OP's house, so how is he not involved when he could be held liable should the ex choose to call the police?", "And the son took 200.00 dollars from OP and then never used it on Tonya.  What did he do with that money too?", "Depends on the area, in my state felony theft is 2,500 dollars or more. In this case it'd be classified as a class C misdemeanor.", "I'm anti-locks on the outside of the door (and without permission if not in your own home). Inside and old enough (and granted permission)? Fine, have all the locks you want. \n\nBut when I was six/seven, I accidentally locked myself in my room because the people who owned the home before us had outside locks on the kids' doors and my parents hadn't gotten around to changing out the knobs/hadn't noticed (it's been about 23 years since we moved to that old house so my memory's a bit fuzzy lol). They *did* hear me crying when I couldn't leave my room when they called me for dinner and immediately came running and got a new doorknob on the next day. \n\nSo yeah, long story short--locks on the inside and with permission? Good. Locks on the outside? What the hell is wrong with that person?", "My point is he doesn't know if its truly stolen. Like i said, there are apps to make up text messages. He should stay out of it. They are adults. Police likely wouldn't deal with the issue of an xbox. They would say its a civil matter.\n\nHonestly, the fact that he knows so much about his sons love life and relationship to me says hes a bit overbearing. Let him be an adult and face adult consequences.", "Say it with me man-ip-u-la-tion", "Not only that but the way he's been treating this woman too! Like, wtf?", "OP just learned a lot about what his son is actually like. $200 and he used it to buy a $10 tee.", "\u2026.okay\u2026? Lol Felonies are pretty serious", "Police don\u2019t get involved in theft of excess of 500+ possibly more depending on where you live? Yeh they definitely will..", "Son involved Dad when he stored stolen property on Dad's property. Dad had every right to give it back to the victim.", "Uh, are you not aware that stolen property falls under the purview of the police? Bc it most likely wouldn't just stay between her and the son if she chose to call the police on him for stealing her property.", "No, she handed it to him freely.   The police will say \"this is a civil matter\".", "That's not how that works. She lent it to him for a period of time, but didn't give it to him. Think of it like this: if you let your friend borrow your car as long as they bring it back before, say, five, and you call the cops on them at 4 (without aaking for the car back first), then you'll get in trouble bc you gave permission. But if you call the cops after five, the friend will get in trouble bc at that moment, they don't have permission. This is all assuming there's some record of the agreement, of course.", "We're not discussing something with title papers registered with the government.   We're talking about a game console she freely handed to him and now wants back.   The police would not involve themselves with deciding who has ownership of the console.   That's the purpose of civil court, not police.   Hence civil matter."]}
