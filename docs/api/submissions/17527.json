OP, I would simply not allow her near your child until she works out her issues.", "Since your MIL has made it clear that she is unwilling to be reasonable or respectful about her grandma name the  it\u2019s time to stop [JADE-ing (Justify Argue Defend Explain)](https://childdevelopmentinfo.com/family-building/jade-an-easy-mnemonic-for-difficult-family-members/#gs.j7s21h) yourself to her. You don\u2019t need her permission or approval in this matter, *so don\u2019t act like you do by treating this subject as if it\u2019s up for debate because it\u2019s not*. \n\nMost people have the urge to explain ourselves in a desire to be understood and to avoid potential hurt feelings. When you try to Justify/Argue/Defend/Explain why you made a particular decision to a regular respectful person they\u2019ll listen to your reasons, respect your decision, and move on. When you try to Justify/Argue/Defend/Explain why you made a particular decision to a pushy/unreasonable/boundary stomping person *they\u2019ll* see your reasons only as an opening for debate and something for them to argue against in order to change your mind to do what *they* want instead. **They don\u2019t care** what you want or what your reasonings are, ALL they care about is getting their way and they will use *any* bits of information you give them to try to manipulate, argue away, guilt trip, and brow beat you until until you eventually cave under pressure to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d. *It is pointless to JADE yourself to them* ***so don\u2019t!***\n\nStop engaging in discussions about this topic with your MIL, instead shut it down and change the subject every time. Keep your reply as a firm \u201cNO\u201d that contains no details/explanations for your MIL to argue against. Something like \u201cthat\u2019s not an option\u201d, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t work for us\u201d, \u201cour decision is final\u201d, \u201cthis isn\u2019t up for discussion\u201d, and the simple but classic \u201cno\u201d are all phrases that work great. \n\nThe next time she demands that you let her be called mamma: \u201c**No, that\u2019s not an option**.\u201d She don\u2019t need any more information from you than that (*because by now she\u2019s already heard everything you have to say and decided to argue again anyways*), so **do not elaborate further**. When she wants to know why you won\u2019t do as she says: \u201c**Because that\u2019s not an option.**\u201d Keep using a variation of that reply no matter what: It\u2019s not an option *because it\u2019s not an option*. Why is it not an option? *Because it\u2019s not*. Repeat ad nauseam. It shuts down the argument because there\u2019s nothing for her to latch onto to try and change your mind.\n\n*Be ready and willing to leave (or hang up) if she won\u2019t drop the subject after 1-2 shut downs*. DO NOT engage with her guilt tripping, accusations of \u201cselfishness\u201d, or sob stories. It\u2019s all just manipulation tactics and crocodile tears. Continue to firmly shut her down: \u201c***No.*** **I won\u2019t discuss this with you any further. Drop the subject or I will have to leave/hang up.**.\u201d Then *immediately* follow through if she continues to refuse to respect your decision: \u201c**I asked you to stop. Since you refuse to respect my request I\u2019m going to leave/hang up. Goodbye.**\u201d Then promptly walk away with the baby (or hang up) without letting her get another word in.  \n\nBoundary stomping requires consequences, you have to teach your MIL that if she won\u2019t respect you and your boundaries then you\u2019re not going to stick around to continue the conversation (and neither will her grandkid).", "Just rearrange the letters then and start calling her Ma'am.", "In the Southern US, it's respectful to call someone Miss First Name.
