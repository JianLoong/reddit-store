After a very traumatic birth with my elder one I decided that I'm not ready to go through that again. But we still wanted more children. So a five ago we adopted\n\n\nMy mother in law cares for our family. But she makes her preference for Malcolm is more than clear. To begin she was absolutely furious hearing that i would not be having another biological child and was instantly disapproving. After hearing we were going to adopt a child her anger turned into rage. She screamed about how we didn't know the parentage of the child and might end up bringing in someone who would disgrace her lineage. My husband was able to calm her down. Thankfully when she saw little Julia it seemed like this was all behind us.\n\nYesterday MIL decided to visit us, my husband was away on a trip so she was just helping around. I was absolutely exhausted so i asked if i could go down for a nap and she was more than agreeing. After a few hours she woke me up and informed me that she was about to leave. All was good, i was cooking in the kitchen and all of a sudden i hear a loud bang proceeded with a crying Julia, when i rush into the hall i see Malcom towering over her. \"You're not real! All of this is mine!\" He started screaming. Which was incredibly confusing to say the least \n\nAfter calming them down I asked Malcom what he meant. He then revealed that grandma Muriel had told him that he was \"mommy and daddy's real son\" this made me incredibly mad. \nI asked him what else grandma had told him and he told me all about how she had been telling him that Julia wasn't really his sister and how he should be extra attention for being \"extra special\", how he's always going to be grandma's favourite grandson, and so much more.  \n\nBlinded with rage i blocked Muriel on everything after sending her a text detailing her actions and how this was absolutely unacceptable and how she'd never be seeing her grandkids until they're much older and understand the situation so they wouldn't be swayed by her words. I probably overreacted to be fair, she is quite an old lady.\n\nAfter he returned we got into quite the argument, to say the least my husband disagreed. He adores his mother and told me that stopping her from seeing the kids is inhumane, she's simply old fashioned and she didn't know her words would bring this big of an impact or some such. We will be having a civil discussion about this later.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry i didn't clarify this earlier but both Julia and Malcom know that she is adopted. I've had the conversation with both the children, although i have had it seperately with the both of them. I think i might have to have this conversation once again and make sure Julia knows that it doesn't matter whether she's adopted or not.", "created_utc": 1684172705, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13iexcq/aita_for_telling_my_mother_in_law_that_shes_not/", "score": 498, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wants your daughter to be less than. She does not see her as part of the family. To your MIL, your daughter is nothing more than an interloper who needs to be put in her place, below all of them. The fact that your husband is OK with his mother, or anyone, treating his own daughter like this either means he feels the same way or is just not loyal to you & your children. His loyalty lays with his mother regardless of what she does to purposely hurt his daughter. \n\nIf this progresses to divorce, you are going to have to make sure custody limits her access to the children when he has them. Make sure she doesn\u2019t have either unsupervised so even if it\u2019s just her golden boy she has, she cannot fill his head with hate & disdain for his sister.", "NTA if anything you didn\u2019t react strongly enough. \n\nI\u2019d be looking into getting a restraining order at the least. \n\nheck child endangerment isn\u2019t of the table: her words are Directly responsible for your son attacking his sister.", "I have already commented but I think you need your husband to read these comments to understand how so very wrong he is & what an absolute witch is mother is!", "NTA. Document that and report it to cps or someone and make sure u keep tabs. Because let's say the worse happens and u divorce, they won't allow him to let those kids near her.", "NTA but your husband is fully on board to let his mother abuse your child. Do with that what you wish", "NTA Honestly I'd leave your husband if he insists on his mother coming anywhere near your children. This woman must never ever be left alone with them and must never ever be allowed to even communicate via text or social media to them.  You are a mother first, and you took on an extra special responsibility when you adopted. She is not old fashioned - she is dripping poison and is a danger around your kids. What she did to your daughter and the repercussions to her mental state in the future and also to your son by putting that poison in his mind is inhumane. There is no coming back from this ever.", "NTA. Your husband can't even put his family first? He can have his mother, I'd be leaving until he decided to actually act like a father", "1. First of all, NTA, not even in the slightest. \n2. While MIL is TA for refusing to accept your daughter as your daughter, and messing with your son's mind about all of this, your husband is also TA, since he dismissed what happened, and took her side on the matter. He is going to enable MIL to abuse your daughter throughout her life.\n3. If you want some help from people who deal with nasty MILs, I recommend checking out the JUSTNOMIL Subreddit. They are more than willing to help out.", ">I probably overreacted to be fair, she is quite an old lady.\n\nSo fuckin what. Like sincerely, so fucking what? Oh no, she's old, she's functionally braindead and doesn't know anybetter? Is that the logic here? She told a child his sister was a fake sister and that only he mattered and it led to him mistreating her. This sort of behaviour isn't complicated, these are things you don't say so screw her.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nStand your ground! MIL is being absolutely **toxic** to your kids. Hubs need to wake the hell up!\n\n If MIL continues planting all these \"*you're the only real child*\" ideas in an 8 yr. olds mind it will destroy your family.", "Take\nYour kids and run. Leave the husband with his mommy.", "NTA \n\nYour MIL is an absolute monster & her putting that poison in your son's head is such a violation.", "Your MIL knew exactly what she was doing.\n\nShe deliberately caused strife between your children.\n\nYour husband is a MAJOR AH for letting her get away with this.\n\nShe burned the bridge entirely to the ground, and salted the ashes.\n\nDo NOT let her get away with this.\n\nYou are NTA OP.  Your husband is, and triple that for your MIL.", "My question to your husband would be, \"If his mother didn't think her words would have a big impact why did she wait till you weren't around to say them?\"  She knew what she was doing.", "NTA.  I wouldn\u2019t let her near anyone\u2019s kids.", "She absolutely knew her words would have this big of an impact, that\u2019s why she said them, and that\u2019s why she left before you knew. NTA. Stand strong here. Your daughter doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated as less than. Your husband should be with you on this.", "NTA. She is big time.", "In the pettiest world, it would be excellent for your daughter to respond that you and your husband chose her, specifically, while he was just what y\u2019all got. \n\nBut in the real world it really, really sucks that they\u2019re fighting over who\u2019s the most loved. That\u2019s so deeply sad on its own and it never had to come to that. NTA, but you will be if you let your husband reinforce his Mom\u2019s delusions.", "As an adopted daughter, shes going to remember if you let the lady who is hurting her be around.  She will remember she is less because no one wants to hurt grandmas feelings.  Her feelings be damned.  \n\n\nLet your husband know that what he decides will decide how his daughter will treat him in the future.", "NTA I can\u2019t believe MIL and husband think it\u2019s ok to behave the way they do. Good on you for blocking mother in law, sounds like a toxic as*hole", "You have a goodbye husband problem. This is a hill to die on and he's making excuses for her abuse!

There aren\u2019t polite words to describe your MIL and if your husband doesn\u2019t fortify himself and stop catering to her hate he\u2019s just as bad as she is.", "NTA Sweetie, I'm probably near your MIL's age. She be an asshole, not old fashioned. They had adoption a looooong time ago. As for her son, the one who is kissing her on her bum, the apple fell right beside that asshole tree and still basks in its shade.", "You may as well divorce your husband and take your daughter away because her grandmother may mistreat her as long as she is in his head.", "What an absolute monster your MIL is. Does your husband not see it? Or was he so f\u2019ed up by her that he doesn\u2019t see how cruel she is?  I can\u2019t imagine as a parent being okay with my mother poisoning the mind of my son against my daughter.", "Agreed! Someone might have posted here on Reddit a while back about how his adoptive parents neglected him after they suddenly had a biological child after years of trying before and after adoption. He was contemplating disappearing from them and never going back. The same might happen here where the husband may neglect the adopted child and OP will have to step p and protect her, whether within or outside the marriage.", "Beautiful and powerful.", "This. I had very difficult pregnancies, and we considered adoption to expand our family. Ultimately we decided not to, because of our fears that my MIL would behave this way.", "Think that through.  If he wanted it he would get partial custody up to 50/50.  On his time, he can then expose the kids to his mother even more.  Not very likely a court would grant a no contact condition for the grandmother unless she was a tangible danger and I don\u2019t think this qualifies as that.  Dad would have to agree to that and it doesn\u2019t sound like he would.  Sometimes you can deal with an infestation without burning down the house.", "Document all of this, write a journal of past actions (as factual /dispassionate as possible), and document all future actions. With all of this, I would see if it's possible that all visitation with grandmother is supervised only in any potential divorce decree. I said this because I don't think you can stop him from seeing his mom if he doesn't see sense.\n\n\nNTA", "Please DOCUMENT. Anything you have in writing- texts, etc., dates of her visits, things your son says she said- record EVERYTHING moving forward. If you divorce, your husband will want partial custody, and he will not limit her access to the kids. You do it want this.", "well, I wouldn't jump straight to divorce or accusing him of abuse, that will just make him dig his heels in -  give him processing time before threatening anything like this, sometimes ppl need some time to accept that their family members did horrible things - but I agree that you should absolutely insist the MIL gets cut off, not let her near your kids & not budge on that for *any* reason (including if it leads to divorce).\n\nLike the toxic effect she's having on the kids is super duper obvious, this isnt going anywhere good. If you dont put a stop to it she's going to traumatize the girl & cause the boy to become a jerk.", "I don\u2019t have kids and am proud of your reaction. Stand your ground.", "If your MIL is such an old lady then she has had plenty of time to learn how words have consequences. I am so sick of old people getting a pass on being a POS.\n\nNTA", "You're a good mom!", "OP, show this to your husband.", "Exactly. What's next, he'll just shrug when the MIL refers to Julia as a bastard, illegitimate, an accident, a discard, etc? Best to shut that sh*t down NOW.", "Yup. As an adult I can understand my mom's comments about \"I didn't weigh x amount like you do until after I had kids!\" Was way more about her huge insecurities about her own body than anything to do with me, but that doesn't mean I'd let her say ANYTHING remotely close to that around my kids.", "Oh, she (MIL) understands, all right.  Anyone with a shred of empathy would. She just doesn't care.", "I am even beginning to wonder if the husband was really fully on board with the adoption. He might have put on a facade to please his wife.", "Yeah that is the thing that bothered me the most.\n\nFamily sticks together.\n\nDoesn't matter if you are blood related or not.\n\nMy best friend and I have been brothers for over 20 years.  He's my family.  His kids are my family\n\nWhat his mother did doesn't just affect the adopted child.  It permanently scars the biological child into thinking they are somehow better because they share the same DNA as their parents", "I have several younger adopted siblings. In my eyes, they are just as much my family as my older (full and half) siblings. I\u2019m aghast at the actions of OPs MIL, and her husband.", "No, there is an \"as it should be\" - children should know from the beginning that they're adopted. There should never be a time when they \"find out.\" This has been standard practice for more than 2 decades at this point.", "All her comments about lineage make me wonder if race plays a part and MIL is racist.", "Yes. MIL has put a wedge between those siblings that will likely never truly go away.", "so wait, the adoption agency requires that the parents tell the kids as soon as they learn how to communicate and possibly understand the situation?\n\ndude, there's no one way to parent children.  i'm not disagreeing with you that parents should tell their kids, but let them handle it the way they see fit.  obviously they're competent enough to adopt kids, they'll figure out how and when to tell their kids.", "That's what I picked up. Which is hilarious because she married into the family and it's not her lineage she's concerned with."]}
