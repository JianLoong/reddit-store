After a very traumatic birth with my elder one I decided that I'm not ready to go through that again. But we still wanted more children. So a five ago we adopted\n\n\nMy mother in law cares for our family. But she makes her preference for Malcolm is more than clear. To begin she was absolutely furious hearing that i would not be having another biological child and was instantly disapproving. After hearing we were going to adopt a child her anger turned into rage. She screamed about how we didn't know the parentage of the child and might end up bringing in someone who would disgrace her lineage. My husband was able to calm her down. Thankfully when she saw little Julia it seemed like this was all behind us.\n\nYesterday MIL decided to visit us, my husband was away on a trip so she was just helping around. I was absolutely exhausted so i asked if i could go down for a nap and she was more than agreeing. After a few hours she woke me up and informed me that she was about to leave. All was good, i was cooking in the kitchen and all of a sudden i hear a loud bang proceeded with a crying Julia, when i rush into the hall i see Malcom towering over her. \"You're not real! All of this is mine!\" He started screaming. Which was incredibly confusing to say the least \n\nAfter calming them down I asked Malcom what he meant. He then revealed that grandma Muriel had told him that he was \"mommy and daddy's real son\" this made me incredibly mad. \nI asked him what else grandma had told him and he told me all about how she had been telling him that Julia wasn't really his sister and how he should be extra attention for being \"extra special\", how he's always going to be grandma's favourite grandson, and so much more.  \n\nBlinded with rage i blocked Muriel on everything after sending her a text detailing her actions and how this was absolutely unacceptable and how she'd never be seeing her grandkids until they're much older and understand the situation so they wouldn't be swayed by her words. I probably overreacted to be fair, she is quite an old lady.\n\nAfter he returned we got into quite the argument, to say the least my husband disagreed. He adores his mother and told me that stopping her from seeing the kids is inhumane, she's simply old fashioned and she didn't know her words would bring this big of an impact or some such. We will be having a civil discussion about this later.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry i didn't clarify this earlier but both Julia and Malcom know that she is adopted. I've had the conversation with both the children, although i have had it seperately with the both of them. I think i might have to have this conversation once again and make sure Julia knows that it doesn't matter whether she's adopted or not.", "created_utc": 1684172705, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13iexcq/aita_for_telling_my_mother_in_law_that_shes_not/", "score": 3622, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are a great mother and you\u2019re protecting your children.\n\nPeople who keep on saying \u201caww they\u2019re old, they\u2019re so nice, they don\u2019t mean it\u2026\u201d, annoy me the most.\n\nIf you were a shitty person young, you\u2019re still a shitty person, just older. The difference is that you can get away with it.", "If you wanted to be generous you could let her see the kids under **your** personal supervision. If she makes any more comments about your son being more important than your daughter then she gets cut off completely. \n\nAnd make sure your daughter knows to tell you (not her father) if your MIL says anything like that again.", "I hope you and your husband can talk through this and work it out.  Bear in mind that if you split, you will have no control over her access to your children during his time with the kids.", "Please note: if/when you divorce, your husband will absolutely let his mother influence your son. Unfortunately.", "Why did they discriminate against him?", "My mom is around her age and would be absolutely appalled at this woman.  Her age has very little to do with her nasty views.", "My grandparents are in their 80s and adopted two children. Adoption isn't a new fad.", "INFO: how do his sisters think of/treat Julia? Do they know about this incident?", "Thought I recognized it, you're definitely NTA and she'd never see my kids again !!", "Full custody, no question.  Kids will suffer if she doesn't.", "Unfortunately, divorce won't help. Father will get partial custody at least and allow Mommy Dearest around his kids as often as he can. Couurts rarely consider emotional abuse and, as long as he is seen as a \"good father\" he will get partial custody", "Adoptees have trauma to begin with from being ripped away from their birthmother. \nYour MIL shouldn't be allowed to add to it.", "Things have settled down for now. I'm not going to jump to divorce until i know that if i do so my kids will be safe.", "His sisters adore Julia to no end, they treat her as they do Malcolm i haven't really seen any problem with them. But they aren't in contact as much so they haven't gotten to know about the situation just yet as it's fairly new", "G7", "It'll be interesting to hear their take, then. Good luck with everything, keep us updated when and if you can please!", "This doesn\u2019t feel real", "YWBTA If you let this continue. \nI was adopted from birth and my grandma was the same and always treated me poorly compared to my cousins. \nI've been NC for years, and LC with my mom because of it. \nDon't make your children grow up with that level of hate in the home or they'll grow to resent you also.", "Your actions were correct, and your husband is a big problem.  He is a namby pamby mama's boy who is more concerned over his witch of a mother's feelings than the damage she is doing to his own children and his marriage.  He is married to you, not his her.\n\nYour husband needs counseling, and so do you. You need to put and keep your foot down on this.  His mother is toxic, and she won't change.  She is his responsibility, not yours.\n\nYou should consider what a future with a man like this is going to be like, and he needs to grow a pair b***s and be a grownup.  If he continues to take his mother's side over you and his children, he ought to move back in with her.", "NTA. That is vile!", "NTA.  Your MIL is monstrous, and your husband is happy for her to abuse your daughter.  It may be necessary to divorce him and file for full custody to keep your children from harm.  Take him to therapy immediately, and let him know there that he must make a choice to stand with his family and protect his children, if he wants to remain part of your family.  If he stands with his mother instead, you must make sure he never has unsupervised contact with the children again.", "NTA... As much as I recognize that someone will always care more about their biological relatives, because that is how many people are, the things she told your kid are not ok. It was downright cruel to the other child. And it was never her place to tell those things to the kid at all.", "You married a momma\u2019s boy", "OP tell your husband that between being inhumane to a bigot  disgusting adult woman and an innocent young child you prefer the first option. Any day of the week. And every word he utters in her defense means he shares her disgusting point of view. And if he allows abuse for his daughter he can ride the same train his mother in and lose custody (I mean child services will have a party about a father of an adoptive kid allowing his mother and his bio son to mistreat the adopted child) NTA", "Her \" lineage\"??\nMy, isn't she the previous fucking flower...\nNTA", " Xzppqd to", "Omg... I can't imagine the horror this little girl must've felt when her big brothers did this to her. How terrified and confused she must've been. That's just heartbreaking. \nShe doesn't understand that he was manipulated by his grandma. He also doesn't understand that.\n\nI'd be worried if I were you because your husband made it very clear that he will NOT protect his family from his mother if it's needed. And now you know. I have no idea what kind of impact this had on your daughter but I bet it was traumatizing and I'd be worried about her mental heath if I were you. \n\nYou need to explain much much more to your son ok? He's old enough to understand. Cause even if he was manipulated by his grandma, he's old enough to know what's right and wrong and he's been with his sister since she was little. So what he did is disturbing. Meaning he might be been manipulated since he was a wee one. He needs to know that family isn't about blood.\nAnd I'd avoid having this conversation with him when the father is home. Cause you already know now that Julia's safety and mental health is not his priority.\n\nThat poor girl only has you now that will make her a top priority. So protect her.", "Your husband\u2019s mother is a vile, heartless creature. Your husband needs to remove himself from his mom\u2019s t*t, be a man\u2026 a FATHER and stand up for his children. \n\nHis mom can go kick rocks until she dies. What she did is vile and reprehensible. So damaging! Your children need to stay far away from her until her old ass shows remorse, compassion, and love.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your husband still puts his mommy\u2019s feelings first. You need to have some counseling with him if he thinks it\u2019s okay or something minor with how his mom treated your daughter and manipulated your son.", "NTA. What a horrible MIL and your husband... defending her. These comments are correct, he views this as ok and therefore agree with her comments. He does not view your daughter as important and isn't defending her. When the decision was made to adopt, it also comes with a responsibility of love and protection; he is showing neither to Julie right now. Just because MIL is old and \"old fashion\" doesn't mean she can say and do these things. She's teaching your son that its not only ok, but he SHOULD be treating his sister this way. Either get therapy immediately or start looking for a lawyer for divorce and get full custody with maybe supervised visitation rights.", "Nta.\n\nYou need to make it clear that grandma abused your daughter with her actions and is cut off so your husband understands.\n\nHe can visit her, just not in your home.", "Big man, bad guy! Good woman! Hooga booga! \n\nFfs the man loves his mother, he doest let her abuse", "I would add that my stepfather was born in 1916 and definitely had trouble remembering not to use old words eg said negro when he was in his 100s - but he was utterly not racist and he treated me wonderfully. Being old fashioned doesn\u2019t mean you are a shitty person. It means sometimes forgetting how to use an iPad or the correct modern terms.", "This is THE hill to die on.", "Ask him how likely it is he's gonna want to keep Malcom and have you keep Julia if y'all get divorced over this.", "What a terrible idea. Please do not have your son do this, it will mess him up thinking he is the wedge that drove grandma to be shunned. I can hardly believe this got so many votes, yikes.", "\"bonus grandchildren\" sounds so cute", "It may, but a lot of fundamentalists have a \"sins of the father\" viewpoint.
