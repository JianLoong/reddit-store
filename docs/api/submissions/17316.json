After a very traumatic birth with my elder one I decided that I'm not ready to go through that again. But we still wanted more children. So a five ago we adopted\n\n\nMy mother in law cares for our family. But she makes her preference for Malcolm is more than clear. To begin she was absolutely furious hearing that i would not be having another biological child and was instantly disapproving. After hearing we were going to adopt a child her anger turned into rage. She screamed about how we didn't know the parentage of the child and might end up bringing in someone who would disgrace her lineage. My husband was able to calm her down. Thankfully when she saw little Julia it seemed like this was all behind us.\n\nYesterday MIL decided to visit us, my husband was away on a trip so she was just helping around. I was absolutely exhausted so i asked if i could go down for a nap and she was more than agreeing. After a few hours she woke me up and informed me that she was about to leave. All was good, i was cooking in the kitchen and all of a sudden i hear a loud bang proceeded with a crying Julia, when i rush into the hall i see Malcom towering over her. \"You're not real! All of this is mine!\" He started screaming. Which was incredibly confusing to say the least \n\nAfter calming them down I asked Malcom what he meant. He then revealed that grandma Muriel had told him that he was \"mommy and daddy's real son\" this made me incredibly mad. \nI asked him what else grandma had told him and he told me all about how she had been telling him that Julia wasn't really his sister and how he should be extra attention for being \"extra special\", how he's always going to be grandma's favourite grandson, and so much more.  \n\nBlinded with rage i blocked Muriel on everything after sending her a text detailing her actions and how this was absolutely unacceptable and how she'd never be seeing her grandkids until they're much older and understand the situation so they wouldn't be swayed by her words. I probably overreacted to be fair, she is quite an old lady.\n\nAfter he returned we got into quite the argument, to say the least my husband disagreed. He adores his mother and told me that stopping her from seeing the kids is inhumane, she's simply old fashioned and she didn't know her words would bring this big of an impact or some such. We will be having a civil discussion about this later.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry i didn't clarify this earlier but both Julia and Malcom know that she is adopted. I've had the conversation with both the children, although i have had it seperately with the both of them. I think i might have to have this conversation once again and make sure Julia knows that it doesn't matter whether she's adopted or not.", "created_utc": 1684172705, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13iexcq/aita_for_telling_my_mother_in_law_that_shes_not/", "score": 1788, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Disclosing this secret is NEVER favored over incorporating the fact into the child's worldview from the outset. It's their life, their story, and they are entitled to know it instead of having their reality ripped from them at some point in their childhood when their adoptive parents decide for them that they're \"ready.\" I say all this as an adoptive parent myself who has read the above-referenced research.", "As an adoptee, I will say that if I had found out I was adopted when I was older, it would have shattered me. I was told when I was just shy of three years old. I don\u2019t remember a point in my life where I didn\u2019t know I was adopted. My adoptive parents got a lot of things wrong, but this they did right."]}
