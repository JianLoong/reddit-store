So NTA, your Dad was. Though I understand. Lol.", "How does your dad watching his game \" make you miss new years eve\" ? Midnight comes with or without a TV show countdown, and there are alternatives. You all had your phones, if you wanted to watch some celebrity count down to midnight and watch a ball drop, pull it up on YouTube. Midnight comes no matter what you are watching, you could have pulled up your clock app and counted down the seconds together. I've been to plenty of parties without TV on and we counted down together from a clock. It's about spending the turning of the year with your loved ones. If you all had counted down together, would your dad have yelled at you that he was watching the game? I don't follow sports, but if his eyes work, he could see the plays while hearing you count down. Next time, focus on those who want to participate in life's rituals, and don't give any of your energy to those who choose not to. You will go into the new year in a better frame of mind.", "There must have been an alternate way to watch the countdown? Online or something. I still think your Dad should have changed the channel since it was the majority that wanted to watch it and its NYE but it still seems odd there was no other way to watch it since you had time to prepare and could see that the game wasn't ending", "NTA \n\nThe whole reason for you coming was to watch the ball drop and ring in New Year together. He could have turned it for 2 minutes. I\u2019m in Georgia and that\u2019s what we did.", "My bfs dad did the exact same thing. I'm visiting from Scotland and he can't put the game off for thirty minutes so that we can watch the NYE party. I flew thousands of miles for this bs.

However, as your father was only 1/4 people that wanted to watch it, he should have changed it. \n\nI'm going to say NTA for your feelings and your dad is the AH. If he knew you guys wouldn't want to watch it and still chose his own wants over everyone else then he could've pulled himself away from the game at the end of the 3rd quarter. It wasn't even a championship game, it was the Peach Bowl which is a semifinal. I watched it though and wasn't sorry, but it's also my bday so I carried the vote. As an (American) football fan I recognize how hard not tuning in to a damn good game can be and I didn't even have any skin in that game. But my family comes before my hobbies.", "YTA - why not just watch it on your phone? Were you there to ring on the new year with your family or watch a ball miles and miles away drop on a tv?", "NAH unless you count the people who scheduled the college football playoffs that close to midnight. It was a great game and the end was definitely exciting and worth watching. You can celebrate New Years without seeing the count down on TV. I grew up in central time zone and we never watched the TV countdown. When I moved to Atlanta, a friend asked how we new it was New Years, I told her that we just looked at the clock. Also, does your family have just one TV?", "Is there only one TV in this house? No phone or computers? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re and AH for leaving but weird to be super upset when he told you advance and literally is it the countdown or just being together that matters more? FFS", "NAH \n\nI get everyone's perspective. The game going this late and being close isn't a common thing but he was clear he'd want to see the end. I feel like even if there's only one TV, y'all should have had a backup option ready by the 4th quarter or like 11:40pm at least just in case. Someone could've used a phone or computer or something. \n\nHe might be a big fan of one of the teams, he got to the TV first, he told y'all in advance what might happen and this particular game was extremely close and competitive to the end; you had time to adjust while it was on to figure out a way to stream it or something.\n\nIf it's usually your tradition and y'all carne for the Nye countdown I can understand why you thought he'd turn it on. So by the time you drove there you assumed you'd assume the normal routine but he did tell y'all otherwise. He could have been nice to turn it but probably would've missed the end of the game which would've been disappointing\n\nOp I'd also push back on feeling like it was a waste. You spent the first moments of the new year with people you live. It might not have been exactly how you wanted but still a moment together.", "Also, just for reference OP you have mentioned that you have watched this in years before but never had this issue. A game coming down to the literal last play as it turns midnight on NYE hasn\u2019t happened before. This isn\u2019t an instance that you would have experienced previously. And you can\u2019t put a game on hold and change channels so had he switched over he wouldn\u2019t have seen the ending. And someone else mentioned flying hours to miss the ball drop, just FYI they play the NYC ball drop again the next hour for CST midnight as well as other US midnight parties and then again when it\u2019s midnight PST. You can watch those and celebrate as well.", "NTA don't go there next time.

He was watching the game when they arrived, told them he would watch the whole thing and they made no other arrangement? They all had phones. Pull up the countdown on your phones! Instead of arguing and thinking it's ok for him to turn off a game he's been watching for hours, that came down to the wire and was an excellent game (I know because I watched it).

YTA", "NTA it's just footy, watch the reruns if it's so important isn't that the point of reruns?", "I'll pull out a Star Trek quote \n\nThe needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one\n\nNTA\n\nYou were there for New Years\nNOT a ball game\n\n And for the people going, \"Well, they could have streamed the ball drop.\" The game could have been streamed as well.", "Sports took precedent in my house growing up to the point my dad skipped family events to watch whatever game was on . As a result I don't give 2 shits about sports now and will walk away if they get turned on or even talked about.", "I\u2019ll get downvoted but it was a helluva game and I wouldn\u2019t have missed it either!  NAH", "NTA, your dad is the stereotypical sports dick. He can watch the replay of it later or watch it on his phone. I know my cable provider has an app where I can watch tv on my phone.", "NTA it was rude if everyone there wasn\u2019t interested. But as a UGA family we rang in the New Year watching the game!!! I loved it! I understand your perspective that it wasn\u2019t THAT important to people who don\u2019t care about football \ud83d\ude04", "NTA - we were watching the game (nail biter!) but turned it for the ball drop, then turned it back.  Your dad could have done the same.", "That game was wild. Honestly they shouldn't have had a game that started at 8 because it could go to the new year. I'm gonna say NAH. It's not his fault.the game went long snf the kick happened at the same time as the countdown. Your feelings are completely valid as well.", "As a fan of one of the teams playing in this game, NTA. I watched it on my phone while the family was doing NYE stuff. The game ended about 1 minute before the stroke of midnight too. \n\nSelfish. Every tv provider has an app or a website he could have streamed the game from. Or I\u2019m sure he had a 2nd tv in the house.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nALL of you had phones with the exact time on them. Stop being drama lamas, your dad did nothing wrong..", "Saying \u201cI\u2019m gonna kick you in the nuts\u201d in ADVANCE would be so considerate \ud83d\ude44", "This happened to me last night at a hotel bar!! People were watching the game and didn\u2019t want to change the channel. It\u2019s not a sports bar. It sucked actually. I was nice about it but secretly didn\u2019t like it.", "NTA 3 people wanted to watch the ball drop and one person wanted to watch the game but your dad felt his wants were worth more than his entire family\u2019s I would have been irritated too. Then to call you rude and insensitive really shows a lack of self awareness on his part.", "The game is way more important than watching the fucking ball drop again", "The Peach Bowl literally ended on the last play of the game being a missed field goal that would have won the game at 1 minute after midnight.  Did NONE of these people have a smartphone/tablet/computer?  Why can't they find another screen to put it on.   ESH.", "It should also be noted that the final play of the game literally happened as the day/year clicked over to midnight. The dad did watch the ball drop - in the game. Arguably one of the most exciting games of the year (or longer) with major implications for those that follow college football.", "OP was actually only able to tell it was New Years via sun dial", "I\u2019ve never understood watching other people celebrate.  It\u2019s like watching fireworks on tv - nothing like real life.  The game was awesome, just watch a replay of the ball drop.", "Yeah I don't understand their logic in that schedule at all", "Seriously- yeah he was there first but literally everyone else was outvoting him???", "Thanks for the feedback! I know NTA is in the lead right now, but you and others have made good points. It was an unfortunate situation. And yes, it seems like it was a crazy game.\n\nI do want to clarify one thing though: I think it was less about watching the ball dropping or whatever ridiculous antics they do on TV, and more about the act of counting down and celebrating together exactly at midnight. Changing the channel kinda functions as a signal meaning, \"we are now counting down to midnight.\" The ritual of celebrating exactly at midnight (together, as a family) was kinda made impossible by the game being on.", "No idea why they\u2019re downvoting you, I completely agree-\nAnd this is coming from someone who\u2019s birthday parties as a kid were always planned with football schedules in mind first, lol", "If watching the ball drop is your new year\u2019s tradition, it\u2019s time to find a better tradition", "No seriously it makes me so annoyed- my family are huge football fans, and *every* event in my life has revolved around sports for as long as I can remember.\n\nLike this year was sorry- no Christmas movies on Christmas Eve night, the game is on.\nMy birthday falls around playoffs, so my birthday parties with friends as a kid always had to be on a day when there wasn\u2019t football on, or at a place where a tv is available. \nIt kinda made me dislike football, it was put on a pedestal as this amazing thing and when I tried to watch it as a kid I realized it was extremely boring and not worth all this hype from them.", "It's so frustrating that people put so much stock into a bunch of people tossing around a weird-shaped ball.", "This wasn't a random quarter this was the final 9 seconds in a nail biter. Listening to it on the phone is a shit way to watch a crazy game.", "You forgot /s\n\nI actually think both things are boring, but the majority wanted to watch the countdown and not a stupid game.", "Idk, when 3 members of a family want to watch something else for a couple minutes I think that trumps what one person wants", "Someone else mentioned this, but is it possible he had money on the game? A lot of people did and that final play was a nail biter (and also cost a lot of people a lot of money.)", "problem here is the whole family, expect the dad apparantly, met up to celebrate NYE and usually you watch some sort of countdown. It's just egoistical what their dad did, and according to the comments, there seems to be a trend. He could've switched to his smartphone or tablet, while the majority does their celebration", "He was there first and told them he was going to watch the game. And one is much more exciting than the other. Put on the ball drop from any of the past 10 years and it's basically all the same.", "What an idiotic statement. Superbowl 2017 the falcons were starting to blow a huge lead to the patriots in the third quarter. And this wasn't the third quarter or a random field goal. This was a consequential game that was down to 9 seconds and it was a roller-coaster the whole game. Also this wasn't the super bowl so maybe be a little bit informed before you talk out of your ass.", "Does it though? if your watching a movie and right before the end other family members come in and request you change the tv are you going to or are you going to watch the end of the movie because that\u2019s what they are asking the dad to do skip out on the final play of the game after watching it for four hours", "I'm pretty confident that OP is somewhere in the British Isles. The phrase \"if I remember correctly\" is perfectly normal turn of phrase there, without any insidious double meanings.", "Right, so watch a football game from the past 10 years.  They're all the same.", "What an idiotic statement.   Some people just don't care about football.", "You know that watching a game on TV doesn't change the outcome right? Watch the replay. NTA.", "For something that\u2019s boring and happens literally every year", "Honestly changing that game to watch the ball drop should lead to criminal charges", "Google next time, not YouTube.", "I have great news! The ball will drop again next year, and the year after, and even the year after that", "He probably would have but I watched the game too it was the last 30 seconds of a game that was still undecides on a win. At midnight he was watching to see if Ohio State would make the fg to win.\n\nThese were two teams that aren't our normal team and we still didn't switch over because it was such a close game right at the end. If he moved over for the drop he would have missed the end of the game. \n\n\n\nNow given a majority maybe he should have but at the same time I do understand why he didn't want to miss those last few minutes. He didn't expect it to be an issue be an issue as he didn't expect the game to go to midnight, and be right at the end, and still close enough that it wasn't already decided", "Ohio state fans are die hard. I'm in a family full of them. This game wasn't just any game. It was to go to the championship.", "Couldn't you have put the countdown on your phone or a tablet maybe?", "No they must be in the Eastern time zone in the US because midnight is when Ohio State attempted a winning field goal & missed. It was am exciting game. I\u2019m going NAH because sure, the women were disappointed but I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to change the channel at that moment either if I was a fan of one of the teams playing.", "On the TV?", "The dad is the one who should have pulled out his phone. Making everyone else wait around for him on new years is asshole behavior. \n\nIf you\u2019re the only one who cares about the game, it\u2019s very rude to make everyone else cater to you. The same would apply if this was a ping pong match, chess tournament, pickle ball or even football and basketball. I understand some American sports fans cannot imagine everyone else is not as obsessed as they are. Imagine telling your family they can\u2019t watch the ball drop because you\u2019re watching a *really* important checker match. That\u2019s what the dad did.", "Or he could\u2019ve deferred to the majority and watched the game on his phone"]}
