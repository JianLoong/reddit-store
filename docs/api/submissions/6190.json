So NTA, your Dad was. Though I understand. Lol.", "How does your dad watching his game \" make you miss new years eve\" ? Midnight comes with or without a TV show countdown, and there are alternatives. You all had your phones, if you wanted to watch some celebrity count down to midnight and watch a ball drop, pull it up on YouTube. Midnight comes no matter what you are watching, you could have pulled up your clock app and counted down the seconds together. I've been to plenty of parties without TV on and we counted down together from a clock. It's about spending the turning of the year with your loved ones. If you all had counted down together, would your dad have yelled at you that he was watching the game? I don't follow sports, but if his eyes work, he could see the plays while hearing you count down. Next time, focus on those who want to participate in life's rituals, and don't give any of your energy to those who choose not to. You will go into the new year in a better frame of mind.", "There must have been an alternate way to watch the countdown? Online or something. I still think your Dad should have changed the channel since it was the majority that wanted to watch it and its NYE but it still seems odd there was no other way to watch it since you had time to prepare and could see that the game wasn't ending", "NTA \n\nThe whole reason for you coming was to watch the ball drop and ring in New Year together. He could have turned it for 2 minutes. I\u2019m in Georgia and that\u2019s what we did.", "My bfs dad did the exact same thing. I'm visiting from Scotland and he can't put the game off for thirty minutes so that we can watch the NYE party. I flew thousands of miles for this bs.

However, as your father was only 1/4 people that wanted to watch it, he should have changed it. \n\nI'm going to say NTA for your feelings and your dad is the AH. If he knew you guys wouldn't want to watch it and still chose his own wants over everyone else then he could've pulled himself away from the game at the end of the 3rd quarter. It wasn't even a championship game, it was the Peach Bowl which is a semifinal. I watched it though and wasn't sorry, but it's also my bday so I carried the vote. As an (American) football fan I recognize how hard not tuning in to a damn good game can be and I didn't even have any skin in that game. But my family comes before my hobbies.", "YTA - why not just watch it on your phone? Were you there to ring on the new year with your family or watch a ball miles and miles away drop on a tv?", "NAH unless you count the people who scheduled the college football playoffs that close to midnight. It was a great game and the end was definitely exciting and worth watching. You can celebrate New Years without seeing the count down on TV. I grew up in central time zone and we never watched the TV countdown. When I moved to Atlanta, a friend asked how we new it was New Years, I told her that we just looked at the clock. Also, does your family have just one TV?", "Is there only one TV in this house? No phone or computers? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re and AH for leaving but weird to be super upset when he told you advance and literally is it the countdown or just being together that matters more? FFS", "NAH \n\nI get everyone's perspective. The game going this late and being close isn't a common thing but he was clear he'd want to see the end. I feel like even if there's only one TV, y'all should have had a backup option ready by the 4th quarter or like 11:40pm at least just in case. Someone could've used a phone or computer or something. \n\nHe might be a big fan of one of the teams, he got to the TV first, he told y'all in advance what might happen and this particular game was extremely close and competitive to the end; you had time to adjust while it was on to figure out a way to stream it or something.\n\nIf it's usually your tradition and y'all carne for the Nye countdown I can understand why you thought he'd turn it on. So by the time you drove there you assumed you'd assume the normal routine but he did tell y'all otherwise. He could have been nice to turn it but probably would've missed the end of the game which would've been disappointing\n\nOp I'd also push back on feeling like it was a waste. You spent the first moments of the new year with people you live. It might not have been exactly how you wanted but still a moment together.", "Also, just for reference OP you have mentioned that you have watched this in years before but never had this issue. A game coming down to the literal last play as it turns midnight on NYE hasn\u2019t happened before. This isn\u2019t an instance that you would have experienced previously. And you can\u2019t put a game on hold and change channels so had he switched over he wouldn\u2019t have seen the ending. And someone else mentioned flying hours to miss the ball drop, just FYI they play the NYC ball drop again the next hour for CST midnight as well as other US midnight parties and then again when it\u2019s midnight PST. You can watch those and celebrate as well.", "NTA don't go there next time.

He was watching the game when they arrived, told them he would watch the whole thing and they made no other arrangement? They all had phones. Pull up the countdown on your phones! Instead of arguing and thinking it's ok for him to turn off a game he's been watching for hours, that came down to the wire and was an excellent game (I know because I watched it).

Watched the countdown with his family and then after a like 15 minutes of watching fireworks and hugs celebrating the new year he could have gone back to the game exactly where he left off and not missed a thing.", "What's so exciting about watching a ball drop in Times Square?", "Wait does the new year not happen if you don\u2019t watch it on TV?", "Your dad clearly was pretty invested in the game. It sounds like you were on him a bit despite knowing in advance he was heavily invested and seeing it was a very close game. Instead of trying to be excited and ring in the new year with him, you asked him to forfeit what he had been focusing on all night for a brief countdown. It sounds to me like you all need better communication skills. You didn't need a TV, you could have had any clock to countdown with together in the room with him but he couldn't have had any game. It sounds like YTA.", "Do your parents own just one tv?", "Unpopular opinion YTA - be an adult and use your phone. You don\u2019t always get what you want. Grow up!\n\nETA - were you with family? Do you have a roof over your head? Do you have food in your (parents) house?\nCongrats you have more than most! If watching a stupid ball drop on TV and watching other people talk about it is more important than spending time with your family, you have issues.", "nobody who says the word \"sportball\" deserves to have an opinion here", ">sportball\n\nCringe.", "Yeah but then he would have missed the missed field goal. I know I'm in the minority here but I would have been PISSED if I had missed that fg try. But then again, NYE does not mean as much to me as it used to. \n\nIf the rest of the family wanted to watch the ball drop, they could have either 1) turned it on a a different device, or 2) turn the game on for dad on a different device so he could have finished watching the game. Either way, everyone would have been able to see what they wanted. \n\nFor me, ESH.", "Being passive aggressive is not better than overt anger, so this barely matters. She caused an issue over it, everyone knew it, the issue is just whether one feels it was justified. Most of the responses here are basically 'I don't like sports, therefore he is wrong.' I'd say that if he was part of the plan for everyone to come over and watch the ball drop, then OK. But if everyone just showed up and expected him to not do what he was doing, that's lame and dumb.", "You could watch the New Year\u2019s Eve party in tv in Scotland. Why\u2019d you have to fly across the ocean to watch it?", "It wasn't silly to him.", "If you have that feature, but not everyone does. Don't know if that was an option for them.", "Oh, that's cute.  But, you're operating under a misunderstanding...  You think I care about your opinion.\n\nCongrats.  You're a weeb.  Just for men in tights, instead of cartoon girls.  Grow up.", "My husband had it set up on a laptop next to the TV with the ball drop. Worked out great for everyone!", "But didn\u2019t OP say he told them in advance he wanted to watch the game and didn\u2019t know when it would end? The advance notice is my sticking point. If it\u2019s about watching a ball drop then cool, but I think it\u2019s an overreaction to storm out about it if just being together at the turn of clock was what was most important. \ud83e\udd37", "The game was supposed to end 1 hour earlier. It went very long.", "Stop being dense, she obviously meant to spend time and ring in the new year with her partner\u2019s family!

I certainly don't \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You absolutely can put a countdown on hold. Whether you have cable or dish service, you have a cable box that will start recording at the push of a couple buttons. He could\u2019ve done that, watched the game with his family and gone back to watch the ball drop afterwards. It\u2019s not like anyone was going to spoil the ending for him in the house.", "It is also the dads tradition to watch important football games. Something he made clear to everyone.", "Ironic your entire statement is pretty contradictory. So many people don't see the appeal of watching others play sports. Lol personally I like watching sports, but the performances on NYE are also entertaining. You can also watch replays of games. This comment made me laugh though. So thanks and Happy New Year!", "/r/gatekeeping", "Ok so maybe this \u201ctradition\u201d means more to you than it does your father? Perhaps if you had communicated these feelings he would have acted differently. I mean that game was a rare occurrence to say the least and I get why he didn\u2019t turn it off, it was on where I was and the ball drop was on a laptop. I don\u2019t think either side is wrong, I think there was a breakdown in communication. That\u2019s just my opinion, Happy New Year.", "L", "Why couldent it have been op and others that who found another TV or screen to watch the ball drop? I mean he was on it to begin with.

The kick happened as the ball was dropping.", "Even the Michigan game went a little long", "I don\u2019t get this obsession over the ball drop, the time changes either way. missing an all time CFB moment over something that happens every year (and this year they couldn\u2019t even get drunk taking away most of the fun) is just something I wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to do.", "Beautiful", "Much like the 3 other people who admittedly had their faces in their phones. If it was so important they could have pulled up any number of ball drops", "It's far more difficult to stream a live sports game than to watch a clock go from 11:59 to 12:00. I know Reddit hates sports, but I don't know why a recording of Times Square is important either. The dad let his intentions to watch the game be known - it was possible to celebrate without him.", "That's true also", "That's true also", "Thanks! That was helpful", "Thats kind of your own fault. You put everything on him. You probably saw how tense and excited/nervous he was over the game. At 5 til? That's when you start pulling up other measures just in case. Not stare at your dad to silently pressure him to change the channel.", "They were both over 4 hours", "Oh FFS, Reddit doesn't hate sports. There are tons of subs devoted to sports and sports teams. Not everyone is slavishly devoted to sports. That doesn't equal a hatred. \n\nHe could have recorded the two minutes it would have taken them to watch the countdown, then. Simply put, he had commandeered the TV for hours at that point and made the choice to be an ass so he could watch a football game. People get sick of sports when someone is so obsessed that they inconvenience others. He could have put the last couple of minutes off so others could celebrate their holiday in real time in a manner that they're used to.\n\nEdit: I just think it's sad that the father prioritized watching a football game over celebrating with his family.", "That's also true.", "It\u2019s really telling who is a football fan in this thread. Who the fuck is changing the channel on the game deciding field goal", "god maybe I\u2019m the asshole but I\u2019m not even that big of a college fb fan and I couldn\u2019t even change the channel. me and all my friends had to watch that kick there was no way we were gonna miss it. a ball drop happens every year.", "But it\u2019s not a given that one lives till next year", "I have great news! There will be another college football game next week! Who the fuck cares about a football game, and I am a fan, I just don't think if my family is gathered around the TV for a specific yearly tradition that is known and established should be changed because a grown ass adult can't stop looking at dudes running around throwing a ball. Even if it was a \"important GAME\"", "The WOMEN? I'm a woman, and a Gator (rough year) so not a fan of either team and I was glued to the game. When Georgia scored and Ohio got the ball with 58 seconds to go, I went to get my husband who had wandered away and told him to get back and watch this incredible ending.We got the champagne poured and kept an eye on the clock, and at midnight Eastern time  Ohio lined up to kick a field goal for the win, and OH MY GOD THAT WAS AMAZING!\n\nOP missed the chance to share an experience with the dad and millions of others who witnessed something exciting and unpredictable because OP had to pout about not seeing something absolutely planned and predictable. Happy New Year, OP, you're TA.", "The most popular comment echos the \"sportsball\" sentiment that most of this site adopts. Yes, there are plenty of subreddits for sports, but just like The_Donald, femaledatingstrategy, or conservative, I would hardly consider it the prevailing opinion here.\n\nNot everyone has a DVR device. He invested 4 hours to watching this game and it is something he valued. The time was unpredictable; he didn't schedule the game to go that long. I'm not saying his priority was correct by any means, but I also think waiting for 2 minutes to celebrate a new year at 12:02am rather than to storm out would have been an equally gracious way of approaching this problem. Neither side is an asshole.", "It\u2019d be like changing the channel from the ball dropping to a game that\u2019s halfway through the second quarter", "Exactly, so why should dad have had to have changed one of the best college football games of the past decade?", "if the game didn\u2019t go down to the wire he would\u2019ve switched. It isn\u2019t just the context of it being an \u201cimportant game\u201d people turn off bowl games all the time.", "That's bit how that works unfortunately. Something like this has not happened.", "Agreed!  This is what I was coming here to say, though probably not as well as you did! \n\nThe ball drops every year but a game like this could be one in a lifetime.  And it's a lot easier to watch the ball drop on a phone or laptop then to watch a game with many players and camera angles from a small screen.  ESH", "The dad could've switched over to their smartphone or tablet, as the majority wanted to use the TV for their NYE celebrations. In my opinion - and I understand that people love sports - this was a clear priority for this evening and what their dad did was egocentrical. \n\nBut, in the end, it's just about watching something on TV, there are worse things in life. Our opinion will differ in what we think is more important and I stand by my point: at that evening, celebrating together was more important. I would've switched to something everybody wants to watch and would've simply rewatched or resumed watching the game shortly after. It's not the same, yeah, but it would've been a sensible compromise.", "Yeah or they could have taken an interest in the game and watched with their dad, who is clearly a big fan.", "And this was a huge game\u2014peach bowl this year is one of the semifinals for the championship game. Is there only one tv in the house, no one has a phone that can live stream the countdown, or even say\u2026a radio??", "Rather be cringey than watch sportsball.", "Because it\u2019s a family tradition to watch the ball drop and celebrate the new year, and the whole point why his daughters even came over. If the father wanted to watch the game, he could\u2019ve recorded it and watched it later. The game isn\u2019t running away from him but the switch from 2022 to 2023 only happens once.", "Imagine meeting up with your loved ones to celebrate NYE and you just have to watch the lord of the rings throughout the night. I mean, it's very important to you and therefore alright to do what you want, without minding the majority that clearly wants to watch something of common interest, right? Why won't they simply accept your interest in lord of the rings and watch it, join you even though they don't want to? It's clearly more important than celebrating together, your opinion and interests are the most imporant and it doesn't matter what the majority wants. You are more important and whatever you want, no matter the very specific and contraindicative circumstances, is more imporant than others.", "A clock would work too.", "OK, I'm not dragging sports in general--but you've got to admit the idea of 'this is an important game because it leads up to the actually important game!' is not really a persuasive arguement when the rest of the house wanted to watch something else as a family.", "You made that up lol, What section of the world says \"sportsball\"?", "Oh Jesus Christ they missed the thing that happens every single year for something that has literally never happened before. Boo fucking hoo", "Well I\u2019m of the opinion that putting a game, no matter how special, above your loved ones\u2019 happiness is rather selfish"]}
