So NTA, your Dad was. Though I understand. Lol.", "How does your dad watching his game \" make you miss new years eve\" ? Midnight comes with or without a TV show countdown, and there are alternatives. You all had your phones, if you wanted to watch some celebrity count down to midnight and watch a ball drop, pull it up on YouTube. Midnight comes no matter what you are watching, you could have pulled up your clock app and counted down the seconds together. I've been to plenty of parties without TV on and we counted down together from a clock. It's about spending the turning of the year with your loved ones. If you all had counted down together, would your dad have yelled at you that he was watching the game? I don't follow sports, but if his eyes work, he could see the plays while hearing you count down. Next time, focus on those who want to participate in life's rituals, and don't give any of your energy to those who choose not to. You will go into the new year in a better frame of mind.", "There must have been an alternate way to watch the countdown? Online or something. I still think your Dad should have changed the channel since it was the majority that wanted to watch it and its NYE but it still seems odd there was no other way to watch it since you had time to prepare and could see that the game wasn't ending", "NTA \n\nThe whole reason for you coming was to watch the ball drop and ring in New Year together. He could have turned it for 2 minutes. I\u2019m in Georgia and that\u2019s what we did.", "My bfs dad did the exact same thing. I'm visiting from Scotland and he can't put the game off for thirty minutes so that we can watch the NYE party. I flew thousands of miles for this bs.

However, as your father was only 1/4 people that wanted to watch it, he should have changed it. \n\nI'm going to say NTA for your feelings and your dad is the AH. If he knew you guys wouldn't want to watch it and still chose his own wants over everyone else then he could've pulled himself away from the game at the end of the 3rd quarter. It wasn't even a championship game, it was the Peach Bowl which is a semifinal. I watched it though and wasn't sorry, but it's also my bday so I carried the vote. As an (American) football fan I recognize how hard not tuning in to a damn good game can be and I didn't even have any skin in that game. But my family comes before my hobbies.", "YTA - why not just watch it on your phone? Were you there to ring on the new year with your family or watch a ball miles and miles away drop on a tv?", "NAH unless you count the people who scheduled the college football playoffs that close to midnight. It was a great game and the end was definitely exciting and worth watching. You can celebrate New Years without seeing the count down on TV. I grew up in central time zone and we never watched the TV countdown. When I moved to Atlanta, a friend asked how we new it was New Years, I told her that we just looked at the clock. Also, does your family have just one TV?", "Is there only one TV in this house? No phone or computers? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re and AH for leaving but weird to be super upset when he told you advance and literally is it the countdown or just being together that matters more? FFS", "NAH \n\nI get everyone's perspective. The game going this late and being close isn't a common thing but he was clear he'd want to see the end. I feel like even if there's only one TV, y'all should have had a backup option ready by the 4th quarter or like 11:40pm at least just in case. Someone could've used a phone or computer or something. \n\nHe might be a big fan of one of the teams, he got to the TV first, he told y'all in advance what might happen and this particular game was extremely close and competitive to the end; you had time to adjust while it was on to figure out a way to stream it or something.\n\nIf it's usually your tradition and y'all carne for the Nye countdown I can understand why you thought he'd turn it on. So by the time you drove there you assumed you'd assume the normal routine but he did tell y'all otherwise. He could have been nice to turn it but probably would've missed the end of the game which would've been disappointing\n\nOp I'd also push back on feeling like it was a waste. You spent the first moments of the new year with people you live. It might not have been exactly how you wanted but still a moment together.", "Also, just for reference OP you have mentioned that you have watched this in years before but never had this issue. A game coming down to the literal last play as it turns midnight on NYE hasn\u2019t happened before. This isn\u2019t an instance that you would have experienced previously. And you can\u2019t put a game on hold and change channels so had he switched over he wouldn\u2019t have seen the ending. And someone else mentioned flying hours to miss the ball drop, just FYI they play the NYC ball drop again the next hour for CST midnight as well as other US midnight parties and then again when it\u2019s midnight PST. You can watch those and celebrate as well.", "NTA don't go there next time.

He was watching the game when they arrived, told them he would watch the whole thing and they made no other arrangement? They all had phones. Pull up the countdown on your phones! Instead of arguing and thinking it's ok for him to turn off a game he's been watching for hours, that came down to the wire and was an excellent game (I know because I watched it).

I\u2019m biased because I enjoy watching college football and don\u2019t care about the ball drop on TV, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to make someone change the TV if they are already watching it. If someone is watching a TV I want to use, you ask them if it is ok to change the channel, and if they say no, you find a different way to watch what you want to watch.", "He could equally watch the game on replay or just find out the score.\nHe also knew what THEY wanted. \n\nAnd apparently yes, it was completely easy to stream the game.

Why did his preference matter more?", "It doesn't matter what it is, all that matters is that it was important to them and he chose to prioritize his own desires over the desires of his family.

He didn't care about what his family wanted, and that made him an asshole.", "Okay\u2026. YOU have a bunch of tvs in your house, but plenty of people don\u2019t.

Okay...", "I don't care about either the sports or the ball drop, but they were invited over to watch the ball drop.

They \u201cmade their way\u201d to the TV an hour before midnight, and dad didn\u2019t want to change it, indicating he was already watching the game. \n\n.. do you understand the ball dropping / NYE dynamic though? For a lot of families, and it sounds like OP\u2019s family is among them, watching the ball drop for the countdown is a given part of NYE activities. Which is WHY they all \u201cmade their way\u201d over. For this scheduled event that they watch every year at that time (which OP came home to participate in). The TV was already \u201cbooked\u201d for the countdown to midnight. And that\u2019s part of what he accepted when he invited people over for NYE / agreed to host NYE for the family.\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t matter who got to the TV first, because watching the ball dropping was already part of the scheduled programming for the evening. Given that it\u2019s midnight at NYE, it\u2019s actually the *main event* for the gathering.  It would be like if everyone was coming over for dinner at your house at 6pm, and one of the hosts sat at the table at 5:30 to spread out documents and do their taxes, and just refused to move at 6pm when people \u201cmade their way over\u201d to sit down and eat, and just shrugged and said \u201cI was here first.\u201d\n\nEven if there is a deadline for those taxes, that person would be an asshole. Because they KNEW the deadline ahead of time, just like dad knew the game was on, and they KNEW dinner was at 6, just like dad new the countdown is at midnight. So he should have set his taxes and paperwork up somewhere else. Just like dad should have planned to watch the game somewhere else.", ">Oh FFS, Reddit doesn't hate sports\n\nYou'd have a stronger argument if the top voted comment didn't reference \"sportsball bullshit\"", "Again, it really isn't easy to stream a game, especially if I asked my parents to. Try to find a stream for this afternoon's football games.\n\nI'm not judging the family at all, either. My argument is the dad made plans that were still in progress outside of his control. and he is not being an asshole by following through with that. It's unfortunate, but hardly malicious or even rude. Both groups would have been kinder to acquiesce, neither wanted to, and the losing party has the right to be upset they didn't get their way.

I just didn't realize there were that many families with only one TV", "god how hard can it be to appreciate the time with the family and celebrate NYE instead of watching a game, or merely pausing it for a few minutes .
