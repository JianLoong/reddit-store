I was finally getting my type writer!\n\nNext day comes, the family gathers to open gifts and no big box.\n\nOk, so it\u2019ll be under the tree tomorrow morning? I was over Santa but whatever. I waited this long.\n\nNext morning we\u2019re tearing open gifts and the place is a wreck and my grandma brings out two identical big boxes. \n\nOne for me. One for my sister.\n\nI rip the box apart like a wild animal and in the box was a shiny new set of Encyclopedias. Actually half a set. My sister got the other half.\n\nWe all laughed (my friend, my cousins, an aunt or two). \n\nI ended by saying (just to funny) \u201cAnd that\u2019s how your childhood dies.\u201d\n\nI guess that I pissed my grandma off really good.\n\nShe texted my mother (who was home sick with Covid) to tell her what an ungrateful shit I was.\n\nShe says nothing to me until a few days later and I get a message about how she will always love me but I really should adjust my attitude and not be such a brat. Apparently, my Uncles also think I\u2019m an asshole and my gramps is \u201cdisappointed in me.\u201d\n\nI apologized (not for what I said but for hurting her feelings which is not what she wanted to hear.) She\u2019s my grandma! I certainly didn\u2019t mean to hurt her feelings. I read those encyclopedias cover to cover so it\u2019s not like I hated them I just thought it was a genuinely funny, heart warming story about how funny my grandma is.\n\nI don\u2019t see how I am TA or how my apology was insufficient but if you guys think that I\u2019m at fault I will absolutely apologize \u201ccorrectly\u201d.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673164494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106dhz4/aita_for_sharing_what_i_thought_was_a_funny/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not accepting your apology, is that some power dynamic, I'm guessing she's older, is there some place that you threaten her?  \n\nWho knows.", "NAH - I don't think any worse of your grandma for having heard the story about the encyclopaedias. But maybe there's a back story behind them that we're not aware of? Maybe she slaved away saving for them?  Her reaction seemed more intense than what the situation warranted otherwise.

You told a funny story, however it painted her in  a bad light and so she took offense. You appologised and thats all that can be done. The rest will fade into the background over time. If you delivered the joke in a rude or pointed way thats one thing, however, it was obviously not intended that was so a sincere apology is all thats required. \n\nImo grams still owe you a typewriter", "NTA.

She may not have given you what you were hoping for but dang, those encyclopedia sets used to be expensive! Telling that story diminishes the gift she gave you and makes it seem like she killed your childhood . That's not a funny story.", "Yta. You just told a story publically where the moral of the story is that grandma ruined Christmas for you.  You embarrassed her. It was insensitive. She got you something you liked and you focused on what you hadn't been given... But the story isn't the point, it's the retelling of it, the message grandma received was, my granddaughter didn't appreciate my gifts I gave her,  is resentful about it, and thinks I ruined her future. It doesn't matter that you were 'only' joking because it had a truth to it.  Not a cute story. Remember that time when I hoped to get a x and you ruined Christmas, at it's core it's a funny story.", "Of course YTA. You hurt her feelings by \"joking\" a gift killed your childhood.

From your grandmother\u2019s POV, a set of encyclopedias was an amazing gift.
