I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would  also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating. \n\nHowever about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted  and was now lying on the floor unconscious.

On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class. \n\nAt the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong.

You have zero medical expertise. The school has a nurse to determine whether a child is sick and what to do about it. \n\nAnd if you're so certain that kids are faking sick to get out of your class, maybe think about why your class sucks so much. I didn't much like math, but I had several math classes I never would have skipped because I liked and respected the teacher and they made the subject interesting.", "INFO: what is your school's protocol when a child complains of feeling ill during class? If you followed protocol, then you're ok, but the school may have a bad protocol. If you did NOT follow protocol, then sounds like this is your error and you should have a refresher on the protocol.\n\nIn my children's schools, if a kid complains of feeling ill, the teachers usually just let the school nurse make the decision about whether to send him home or not. The nurse will have access to whatever disclosures the parents have made about the child's health conditions, and can handle it appropriately. You referred to paracetamol as Calpol which makes me think you are in the UK, and I'm not sure what is the protocol there, but it sounds like there does need to be a protocol so that teachers aren't left to make judgement calls about medical issues.\n\nI want to point out that if you had sent the kid to the nurse, he could have fainted on the way, so whatever changes you or the school make to the sick protocol, that should be accounted for. Sometimes it's better for the nurse to come to the kid than for the kid to be sent to the nurse. You don't want the kid to faint on the stairs and fall down the stairs.", "YTA. I was a kid who had migraines, and multiple times I had teachers not believe me. It was agony. If this kid hasn't been habitually leaving class and it was the first time bringing something like this up, you should have erred on the side of believing him. Mom had every right to be angry at you. The kid passed out. What if he ended up with a concussion from the fall? That's on you.", "I get not wanting him to skip math class but your dismissive behavior is truly appalling. He told you he had a migraine not just a headache. The fact that he specified what kind of headache should have clued you into the fact that something was wrong enough he needed to go to the nurse immediately. If he\u2019d fainted in the nurse\u2019s room odds are he would have been already lying down thus reducing his chances of being injured. By keeping him there you made it worse. YTA", "YTA.  As a teacher, this is insane.  It\u2019s not our job to assess if a kid is faking or not.  If he says he\u2019s feeling sick, write a nurse pass and send him to the nurse, and she\u2019ll deal with it.  Not only are you enormously negligent in this case, you\u2019re also putting the entire school, not to mention the student himself, at huge risk.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely bonkers that you didn\u2019t send him to the nurse immediately.  If he struggles in math and fakes an illness to get out of class, his grades will reflect that and he will learn the consequences.

I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would  also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating. \n\nHowever about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted  and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class. \n\nAt the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong.

It's often extremely hard to continue sitting up. \n\nAnd also, an important detail: OTC painkillers like paracetamol (Calpol is paracetamol, right?) tend to work best when taken as early as possible. Preferably before the pain properly sets in. The longer you wait, the less useful they're likely to be, if they'll help at all, and the longer the migraine will last.

I had 7 kidney infections in one school year because my teacher would never let me use the bathroom and outright accused me of just trying to get out of class, and admin didn't care. My parents should've moved me to the public school after that, but that's an entirely different problem.\n\nOne of the boys in my class tripped and fell during gym and knocked himself unconscious for a solid two minutes, and nobody bothered to call his parents. He had a concussion. A girl in my class fell off the playground equipment and hurt her arm and was ignored. She had actually *broken* her arm. Same school, same admin. The only thing that school cared about was making sure we went to church and said our prayers. They didn't care about our education or health. And my parents wonder why I say any kids I might have in the future will never go to a Catholic school.", "As someone who currently works in education, I can absolutely imagine this is real. Either you\u2019re covering serious ass right now or you just weren\u2019t paying enough attention because this does happen.

And let\u2019s be real, kids lie sometimes. Now, at our school there is one nurse and one assistant. The nurse isn\u2019t even there everyday. The teachers are given a \u201cfirst aid kid\u201d with bandaids and gauze and told only to send actual emergencies. Headaches get sent immediately back to class. They aren\u2019t allowed- per district and board decision- to do anything but take their BP and temp. Maybe this teachers school operated the same way. \n\nHere\u2019s food for thought though: where TF is this kids 504 plan if he actually has a medical condition. I\u2019ll answer: either mom isn\u2019t doing her job as a parent or the kid isn\u2019t actually diagnosed. Bc if mom did her the kid would have a 504 plan protected by law IF there is a medical diagnosis. That\u2019s how 504 plans work. And the kid would have been to the nurse in a heartbeat bc the law and because the teachers were properly informed of a medical condition.", "I\u2019m not advocating for kids to not get treatment. I was simply saying that I understand why he didn\u2019t immediately send the kid. Anecdotal? Yes. Do kids lie to get of class? Also yes. Can kids get migraines? Yes. Do kids repeat words adults say that they do not fully understand or actually relate to them? Again, Yes. Look, being a teacher is hard af. And teachers are humans too. They have faults and make dumb decisions just like literally everyone else. People need to stop expecting them to be perfect. Especially when so many parents are absolute trash at raising their own kids, yet run raging when a teacher errors. It\u2019s ridiculous. \nMy actual concern here is that, with all of the protections provided legally for kids with disabilities, why does this child not have a 504 plan? Why is his mother so concerned with her child\u2019s well-being only when the teacher makes a mistake yet she can\u2019t be bothered to EASILY get him accommodations for this disability he has?Quick answer: she can but didn\u2019t. Or he doesn\u2019t get migraines and there\u2019s something else going that she had t actually addressed. \nIf she had, he\u2019d have a copy of it, he\u2019d have known about the migraines and sent the kid immediately. \nI guess it\u2019s real easy to blame the teacher but parents get off Scott free for not doing their jobs.", "My brother was a very poorly baby so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find they started much earlier", "What a horrific thought.

If teachers are being asked to do a medical assessment of kids before allowing them to see the nurse, it's just an accident waiting to happen.
