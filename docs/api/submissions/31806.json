I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would  also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating. \n\nHowever about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted  and was now lying on the floor unconscious.

You have zero medical expertise. The school has a nurse to determine whether a child is sick and what to do about it. \n\nAnd if you're so certain that kids are faking sick to get out of your class, maybe think about why your class sucks so much. I didn't much like math, but I had several math classes I never would have skipped because I liked and respected the teacher and they made the subject interesting.", "INFO: what is your school's protocol when a child complains of feeling ill during class? If you followed protocol, then you're ok, but the school may have a bad protocol. If you did NOT follow protocol, then sounds like this is your error and you should have a refresher on the protocol.\n\nIn my children's schools, if a kid complains of feeling ill, the teachers usually just let the school nurse make the decision about whether to send him home or not. The nurse will have access to whatever disclosures the parents have made about the child's health conditions, and can handle it appropriately. You referred to paracetamol as Calpol which makes me think you are in the UK, and I'm not sure what is the protocol there, but it sounds like there does need to be a protocol so that teachers aren't left to make judgement calls about medical issues.\n\nI want to point out that if you had sent the kid to the nurse, he could have fainted on the way, so whatever changes you or the school make to the sick protocol, that should be accounted for. Sometimes it's better for the nurse to come to the kid than for the kid to be sent to the nurse. You don't want the kid to faint on the stairs and fall down the stairs.", "YTA. I was a kid who had migraines, and multiple times I had teachers not believe me. It was agony. If this kid hasn't been habitually leaving class and it was the first time bringing something like this up, you should have erred on the side of believing him. Mom had every right to be angry at you. The kid passed out. What if he ended up with a concussion from the fall? That's on you.", "I get not wanting him to skip math class but your dismissive behavior is truly appalling. He told you he had a migraine not just a headache. The fact that he specified what kind of headache should have clued you into the fact that something was wrong enough he needed to go to the nurse immediately. If he\u2019d fainted in the nurse\u2019s room odds are he would have been already lying down thus reducing his chances of being injured. By keeping him there you made it worse. YTA", "YTA.  As a teacher, this is insane.  It\u2019s not our job to assess if a kid is faking or not.  If he says he\u2019s feeling sick, write a nurse pass and send him to the nurse, and she\u2019ll deal with it.  Not only are you enormously negligent in this case, you\u2019re also putting the entire school, not to mention the student himself, at huge risk.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely bonkers that you didn\u2019t send him to the nurse immediately.  If he struggles in math and fakes an illness to get out of class, his grades will reflect that and he will learn the consequences.

So you could ignore your responsibility  to send an ill student to the nurse so the nurse can do the nurses job.  This is exactly why the nurse is there.  \n\nAnd you did this to an 8 year old child.  A child in your care.  You are directly responsible for his injuries, as sure as if you struck him down yourself.  \n\nI'm betting this is just the tip of the iceberg.

I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would  also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating. \n\nHowever about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted  and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class. \n\nAt the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong.

It's often extremely hard to continue sitting up. \n\nAnd also, an important detail: OTC painkillers like paracetamol (Calpol is paracetamol, right?) tend to work best when taken as early as possible. Preferably before the pain properly sets in. The longer you wait, the less useful they're likely to be, if they'll help at all, and the longer the migraine will last.
