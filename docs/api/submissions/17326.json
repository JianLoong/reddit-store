It could be she was encouraged/egged on by others and told things she mistakenly believed.  If that is the case, that relationship might be salvageable, but it might also not be and you could just find out she is even worse than your mom and go NC with a clear conscious.", "NTA\n\nWho kidnaps a person who\u2019s nearly 9 months pregnant and takes them to a livestock option? Wtf??\n\nI just don\u2019t understand why your mom seems to have so little respect for you?\n\nAlso your 16 year old sister needs some consequences cuz that shit isn\u2019t funny and it\u2019s super not okay. \n\nI might just refuse to get in the car with them or eat with them? They clearly do not respect your boundaries.", "NTA. I have a 16 year old who would never dream of doing something like that. She\u2019s learned that shorty behaviour from your ignorant mother who has zero respect for anyone. I think for your sanity you need to step back. They obviously are too self absorbed to realise how wrong they are because they\u2019re blaming you for your reaction to their actions. Still no lesson learned for them.", "Your mother has sucessfully turned your sister a bully like herself, and she is just 16 and bullies her older sis, just think what she will be when she is after a decade.\n\nYou must stay away from your sis and mom, they are litrally stressing u in ur pregnancy.\n\nGoing NC is best option for your peace of mind, let your sis keep crying\n\nNTA", "NTA but you do sound boring for not trying new things.", "NTA- I would cut them out to but I would have done it a lot sooner. But I would also be worried about how they would treat your kid as well. If they don't see anything wrong with how they have been treating, you while you're pregnant what kind of treatment would your child endure? You're allowed to decide what you want to do or eat without being tricked or forced. If your sister feels bad, then she should because she forced a pregnant woman to eat sushi. Sushi is highly unrecommended for pregnant women and she put you at risk of choking which would have put the baby at risk.", "YTA for getting in a car with this woman repeatedly, dumbass", "NTA. If someone shoved food in my mouth I disliked and held it shut while laughing I would reflexively start punching them in the face repeatedly.", "Plus aren\u2019t you supposed to not eat sushi when pregnant? \n\nThey sound insufferable, like those moms who don\u2019t believe in their kids neurodivergence or allergies or whatever and constantly just try and force shit on them. Some weird control thing.", "With the sushi, on top of mercury risk, there is also a risk of certain pathogens and parasites that in non-pregnant people would not even be noticed and would not cause disease,but to mother and unborn child can be devastating!", ">NTA and stop hanging out with them.\n\nPERIOD. FULL STOP. NO MORE NEEDS TO BE SAID.", "That\u2019s when you call the cops and get mommy dearest arrested for kidnapping.", "They have had more than enough opportunities to change their ways. NC w both. Never a grandmother nor an aunt. They have both lost the privilege of being in OP's life. Forever more.", "You know you aren't supposed to eat sushi when pregnant. You should tell you sister so she can at least be respectful to your baby.", "You\u2019re NTA, but ffs stop getting into the car with your kidnapper mother!", "Yes!\n\nThey are direct and immediate threats to the lives of the OP and if her unborn child!", "This is my understanding OP resents her mom for being a teen mom so now that mom is older shes trying to make up for OPs childhood and form some kind of connection and doing it wrong. Mom is an asshole sister too. But instead of talking to them OP let's it build up until she explodes so she's an asshole for calling them losers for wanting to have some kind of bond with her.", "Yep also mum shouldn't take her near livestock when pregnant either, I think it's sheep that are the problem? Especially when lambing but could be wrong. Just remember seeing signs for pregnant women to avoid the farm bit at a kids attraction I went to last weekend. \n\nNTA, I'd go low contact and never leave them alone with kid, they have zero respect for your boundaries or safety and quite honestly sound exhausting and annoying. Can't see much joy in spending time with them. Maybe no contact will teach them to respect others.", "Your understanding seems flawed. Literally forcing people to go places they do not want to go is not a wrong way to form a connection. It\u2019s kidnapping.", "***NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO EAT ANYTHING THEY DO NO WANT/LIKE.***\n\nFIFY", "Op was lied to about where they were going yes but she still got in the car and went and stayed of her own freewill nobody forced her to stay OP could have gotten an Uber or left or call fiance to pick her up so I wouldn't call it kidnapping. But your missing the point OP should have talked to her family before it came to the point where she had to explode on them especially because it sounds like op is pregnant and that stress isn't good for her so I stay by my ESH.", "OP is full of things she hates doing or trying. This whole post is nonstop I hate this, I don\u2019t do that. She\u2019s very rigid. It\u2019s going to be very tough for her when her kid wants to do things outside her comfort zone - of which there appears to be an abnormal amount of things. Most likely she will end up limiting her kid because she can\u2019t and won\u2019t expand her own extremely limited interests and likes. It\u2019s sad, really.", ">OP is full of things she hates doing or trying. This whole post is nonstop I hate this, I don\u2019t do that.\n\nI don't understand. The whole point is that her family is forcing her to do these things and she's tired of it. Would you have liked it if she offset it by listing things she *did* like even though it would have nothing to do with the post? Was her mentioning that she loves parks not enough? That's like if someone made a post about their roommate stealing their food and you complained that all they were talking about was that they hated their food being stolen. \n\n>It\u2019s going to be very tough for her when her kid wants to do things outside her comfort zone - of which there appears to be an abnormal amount of things.\n\nShe listed three things: auctions, farming, and deserts. In what way is that an abnormal amount? Are you telling me you don't have 3 things you don't like doing or places you don't like going to?", "What? Fish is fine during pregnancy.", "NTA. It's ok to cut ties with toxic people. Doesn't matter if they are family.", "I have explained my reasoning sufficiently. Have a good night.", "Sure you have"]}
