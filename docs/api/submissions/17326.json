OP, you\u2019re clearly an adult and you should definitely have a say in what you like and what you don\u2019t like. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to try something or don\u2019t like something, you absolutely do not have to try it and nobody should force you to enjoy things because THEY like it! That\u2019s just some narcissistic shit. Your mom and sister are disrespectful losers who have serious boundaries issues. Because shoving food into someone\u2019s mouth and making it so they can\u2019t spit it out is weird and disgusting. If you started choking on that sushi they\u2019d probably say  you\u2019re overreacting. \n\nSorry to say, your mom and sister are absolute clowns who need to have their boundaries tested soon.", "Nope. Nope. Nope. Never agree to go anywhere with them ever again unless you have your own transportation, at the very least. Had they pulled that trick on me, I'd be firing up that Uber app so fast they wouldn't even know I was gone until they looked for me.", "NTA. Stop hanging out with them.", "If she is able to. I have a similar phobia, it's a part of claustrophobia, where I can't deal with not being able to breathe. I can't snorkel, I can't use the CPAP they want me to use, I can't even wear a full-head Halloween mask. If someone put their hand over my mouth I would freak out. Part of the issue is I have problems breathing through my nose, so if I can't mouth breathe, I'm in trouble. I'd probably grab their hand and try to bend their fingers before I would bite or lick someone. I've heard that if someone is trying to garrote you (OK, I watch a lot of thrillers), don't try to put your fingers under the cord, which is what everyone instinctively does, you should try to attack the other person with your hands, as that will be more likely to save you. Except no one does it because it's instinctive to try to relieve the pressure. I suspect I'd be the same thing with my mouth.", "Man y'all are pretty passive about someone shoving food in your mouth and then touching your mouth with their hand afterwards I straight up with a punched her in the face. Lol", "The sister woke up looking for a fight and should be happy she didn't get a slap to the face. Girl needs to learn some boundaries.", "Yeah, that desert thing sounds like a plot from a horror movie.", "Your also advised to stay away from livestock when your pregnant.", "Only if it contains raw fish.", "Yeah. OP, at the very least stop getting into cars driven by any of them. If they complain, tell them you don\u2019t trust them and they can go pound sand.", "you shouldn't be torn when these people are physically forcing her to do things against her will", "Also a worthy and petty option.  A lick certainly ups the ick factor without it being a hurtful attack.", "Yeah, out to the desert or a livestock auction \ud83d\ude44", "Tell your mom if she lies again about plans she is drawing you into that you'll go from LC to NC.   Your mom's behavior is so disrespectful.  You sister is following her lead in disrespecting you and being a bully.", "Go NC for awhile and if they cared they\u2019ll change but if they don\u2019t then I guess continue being NC with them", "I was wondering if that was really the best place to be while pregnant.", "Sheesh. Op made the right choice blocking them", "pregnant women should not eat sushi. NTA.", "This is all working under the assumption that you're calm enough in the moment to think of this.", "She HAS spoken to her mum.\nOP Isn't posting just because of one incident.\n\nShe's had enough and too right!! OP you're preggers, focus on you and your new family.\nLC is the way!", "Oh for sure! I agree, I just meant for her to tell her she won\u2019t get in a car with her anymore if it happens again. Clearly her mum is not listening when she says \u201cno\u201d. If mum wants their relationship to continue, she needs to understand she can\u2019t keep getting away with that completely dismissive behaviour, ie, an ultimatum. \n\nBut I agree, she should focus on her and her new family and just go LC/NC if these conversations getting nowhere are too fatiguing.", "Yup. My OB basically said I could eat whatever I want except for fish. Most say to heat up deli meat or not eat it, only well done steak, etc, and she was like, don't worry, it's fine. Just no fish, especially not sushi. Which didn't bother me because I don't even like the stuff.", "Ditto", "Again? It's been two times already. Nope. Third time would be a mistake.", "*insert dancing panda gif*", "There's nothing wrong with fish. It's recommended for pregnant women, you only have to mindful of the mercury content. And not all sushi contains fish anyway.", "I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m getting these downvotes by agreeing with everybody? \nI agree that enough is enough. All I was suggesting was an ultimatum. Not getting in the car with her mum. But okay \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Raw fish/seafood could be iffy for a pregnant woman. \n\n It is worth checking where \\*cooked\\* fish/seafood comes from for heavy metals contamination,  industrial pollutants, etc.", "I think because you said \"if she does it one more time\" and everyone is saying she's done it enough already.", "You are not being downvoted? People are disagreeing with the idea of giving a third chance, onky that.", "Yeah ok, that\u2019s so fair. I meant that to suggest if she gave her an ultimatum. There would be no way to test out if she would actually change from that without giving one more opportunity. But I totally understand that enough is enough, maybe from now on OP could just refuse yo get in a car with her mum at all."]}
