And what do they call each of the other grandparents?", "This is a strange hill on which to die. You admit that you see him as a grandfather to your children, and that he\u2019s more active in their lives than the biological grandfather. It sounds like he loves your kids and is good to them. Why not give him this, and let him be \u201cPapa Fred\u201d? YTA", "Have you asked your kids if they'd like to give Fred a special name now that he is married to grandma and part of the family? Then you can approach him and let the kids tell him the name THEY picked for him. It'll be more special to him and then any time Mil tries to enforce the other name you just correct her.\n\nI'll leave this as an ESH because of the dynamic", "YTA. You\u2019ll take his money for their college, but he can\u2019t have a special name? You\u2019re being ridiculous.", "YTA. You view him as a grandparent, he is very involved with your child and he is generously contributing to the child\u2019s future. If you don\u2019t like papa Fred then choose something else or let your child choose a special name.", "You know what YTA.  Your husband on the other hand is definitely the bigger AH.  Someone is insecure as hell with the new family dynamic and should probably go to therepy.", "YTA- you seem more intent on sticking it to your mother in law, than in recognizing the very real efforts Fred is taking to foster and earn that grandparent relationship. Why do your children and Fred have to lose, just so you can make sure that your MIL doesn\u2019t win?", ">He clearly cares for our kids, is generous with his money for their future (contributing to college funds)...I very much so recognize him as a grandparent to my children. He is more active in their life than my husband\u2019s actual father.\n\nYTA. It's unbelievable that considering all that, you're harping about \"Papa Fred\"?  Do you constantly look for things to get upset about for no good reason?", "Seems you and your MIL are more alike than you think you are - both controlling characters", "OP, this is not at all like the situation you are conflating it with, where a stepparent starts insisting to be called \u201cMom\u201d or \u201cDad\u201d to force a relationship on a recently traumatized child. \n\nFred already has a grandfatherly relationship with your kid\u2026a kid who is 4yo and rightfully confused. When I was 4 I called my grandmother \u201cMom\u201d for a little while because I heard the adults calling her that and thought I had messed up. Your kid just wants clarification about someone already in their life!\n\nHeck, when all my grandparents died, my mom\u2019s Aunt and Uncle became our stand-in grandparents. After a few years we (sibling and I) were asked to start calling them Grandpa and Grandma, because they were that to us. It was fine! I am so lucky I had people who wanted to be in my life that way and supporting me. And there is no way in hell I would have just organically decided to name them that without someone suggesting we try it out. I was a kid. \n\nAll of this is to anecdotally say that your MIL started trying to make it happen early, but that doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t be Papa Fred now. Let him be Papa Fred, and try to give your MIL some grace. YTA.", "You said he loves your kids. He\u2019s contributed to your kids\u2019 college funds. You said he\u2019s more active than your husband \u201cactual father.\u201d Sounds like Fred has done more to earn some sort of grand parental role than your husband\u2019s dad. \n\nYTA", "YTA.  You say it\u2019s your mil trying to force it, but have you considered Fred is concerned with stepping on your toes as the kids mother and you potentially not letting him see them at all, if he were to try and say it? It\u2019s pretty messed up to admit you see him as a grandparent, take all the money he\u2019s being generous with and not giving into one tiny thing. If it\u2019s the actual name itself that\u2019s too similar pick something else? My husband alone has a Granny, Grammy, and and Nana Jo there\u2019s a ton of options.", "YTA - This sounds like you and your husband are trying to give your MIL a hard time for her past transgressions but the grandkids and Fred are collateral damage and you don\u2019t seem to care about that piece. \n\nNTA - Has anyone asked Fred what he\u2019d like to be called without MIL being present? If Fred said to you that he wanted the kids to call him Papa Fred, would that change things and/or then would you allow it?", "YTA (since you\u2019ve posted here asking for a judgement).\n\nThis person is more involved as a grandparent than most biological relatives would be. Let him have the fun name and choose another hill to die on. (And there will be others..!\n\nI think your thinking of the situation is clouded by your relationship with MIL, rather than the merits that Fred brings, which sound plentiful.", "I lean YTA because this all reads like you\u2019re so bitter against your MIL that you\u2019re refusing to allow a grandparent name for someone filling the role just to stick it to her. Is she even \u201cforcing\u201d it, or does she know it would mean a lot to Fred and he may feel awkward asking for it himself? \n\nAt the very least I think you should ask Fred what he would want to be called and what he\u2019s most comfortable with. \n\nIt\u2019s a bit messed up to acknowledge he acts more like a grandpa to your kids than your FIL but then be this resistant to your kids recognizing him as such by name.", "So you like him, he likes your kids and has set up college funds for them but because he isnt your husbands bio dad hes just Fred? Will having your child call him Papa collapse the fabric of the universe? (It wont, my grandfather is not related me at all, and yet since my birth he has been Granda, no collapse yet). If you think Fred wont be around for long don't have your kid around him, the abandonment will hurt with or without the title. If you arent worried about that then chillax and have an honest conversation with your kid, about MIL calling him Papa because since your sons birth he has been a grandfather, and using Papa show that your appreciate that and consider him family", "It sounds like he has earned the grandparent name. If you don\u2019t like Papa Fred can you sit down with them and come up with his own unique name. \n\nFreddy maybe?", "YTA Especially since they married. Fred needs his own fun grandparent name, he deserves it.", "NTA.  There's an odd imbalance at play. Fred is not asking the kids to call him Papa? The kids have not started calling him papa? It's your MIL who's pushing it on the whole family? It's like she has an idea and now everybody has to play along. \n\n\"Granpa\" is a title. That title gives a person authority in a family. Giving Fred that authority over your kids is a serious decision. If he's \"quirky\" and you're worried he might violate your children's boundaries start taking measure to ensure he cannot hurt your kids.", "I don't think you're wrong in any way. I just don't understand the resistance about Fred being called Papa Fred? Now, about him being your husband's dad? That's ridiculous. My dad passed away and I am not looking for a stand in - even if my mom gets a BF or a new husband. That's ridiculous to me. I had a daddy. Done deal.\n\nNTA. But, my parents did decide what my children would call them. I did not.", "ESH you mil for forcing it and not listening. You and your husband for treating him like a grandfather and TAKING HIS MONEY for your kids but not allowing him to be called Papa Fred.\n\nChoose a different name that denotes he is a special person to your kids, though don't really see why it matters. Both my dad and fil are Grandad [insert name] neither are offended!!", "NTA\n\nAny relationship but especially a step-family relationship has to happen organically. \n\nMiss Kay from duck dynasty, her grands just call her miss kay she doesn't have a grandma name\n\nBut then again I have at least 3 sets of \"grandparents\" that are not related whatsoever to me. Two of the sets are from growing up in churches, my dad was a clergyman so we knew lots of people from neighboring churches from when we would get together for special services. And one set is from my job, but the guy's grandpa name is \"spike\" so I just started calling him spike as that is what he is listed as in our computer system and it just kind of stuck with me.\n\nIt also seems to me that MIL is pushing for the name not so much fred but maybe think about getting him one.

You want everything Fred has to offer without calling him stepgrandpa. That's selfish. \n\nPeople often try to stop change from happening while it's unavoidable. Instead take the lead and work out boundaries. This man has a grandfather role in your kids live. If you don't want to give him a step grandfather title, that's fine but then maybe he shouldn't contribute financially, not this much at least. Or talk to grandparents about what would be a comfortable title for all of you. Which should have been done ages ago btw.", "I want them to continue to call him Fred. The other grandparent names were established by my oldest when he was learning to talk. He was introduced to them as Fred. If they wanted to call him something new I would support it. It is the fact that she is forcing it that bothers me.", "If the kids or him were the ones to say it I wouldn\u2019t be pushing back.

I am just having a hard time understanding how this person has a grandparent relationship but it is also important to you (or mainly your husband?) not to give him ANY grandparent name, he has to just be Fred. Since your children don\u2019t understand the family history, isn\u2019t it simpler to call him a grandparent name since they just see he\u2019s with their grandma? And now married to her? If you don\u2019t want it to be similar to FIL that part does make sense. But imo YTA for insisting on \u201cFred\u201d despite the relationship. My daughter very much understands that her Grandpa is her Grandpa because he\u2019s my dad and \u201cPoppy D\u201d is my stepfather (also recently married).

Literally any word. In any language. Language is learned from others. \n\nYou literally tell your kids what everything is called. Including \"mama\" and \"dada\".  YOU are what stopped your children from calling him Papa Fred \"organically\".\n\nThere's never been a person that sees a chair and goes \"Chair\" unless you repeatedly tell them what it's called.\n\nYTA You are happy to take his money and support and admit he's like a grandparent to your kids, but you don't want to call him as such? I have aunts and uncles I am in no way related to.", "I agree with the kids not understanding family dynamics. I guess I just feel it is like forcing a kid to call their new step-dad Daddy\u2026that should come with time when/if the child chooses to call them by the affectionate name. Idk.", "It sounds more like your child might be open to a new name, but you are telling them \"no, his name is Fred\". If this is right, your kids will not create an affectionate name. If Papa it too close to your FIL, then maybe suggest something else such grampa Fred. My nieces and nephews all call the grandparent different names that each adult chose for themselves, to make sure the kids knew what to call them from the start and to lessen confusion with multiple grandma's and grandpa's. Explain to your step-FIL the issue with Papa and ask him what else he might like to be called, it might turn out he himself prefers Fred and this is just a weird thing your MIL is trying to push."]}
