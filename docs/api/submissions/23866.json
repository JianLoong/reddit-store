She knows Grumpy has terrible behavior and still invites her to things. It sounds like no one respects your relationship including your husband.", "NTA\n\nBut I suspect you have a husband problem", "Nah, MIL wants to maintain a good relationship because it is better for the kids, and for her relationship with the kids, if everything with the ex-wife is copacetic. Yes it sucks for OP, but it will suck worse for her, and everyone, especially the kids, if OP feeds the drama at all, or if it turns into outright war. It\u2019s not that hard to keep it minimally polite, basic awkward stranger two word answers, and then walk away. You don\u2019t have to pretend to be bffs or try to win her over, just keep it plausibly civil, at the very least when you\u2019re at someone else\u2019s house.", "Grumpy may not be the DIL, but she's still the mama of MILs grandkids.  We may not think it's enough of a reason to root for Grumpy, but MILs likely trying not to lose out on visiting.", "They have kids together.

She's attending her kids' events, same as OP and the kids' father.", "Okay", "He didn't appease her with our wedding; he could tell her to stop and correct the kids until he's blue in the face but ultimately, he can't control what she says. Her saying it was enough for me to just throw in the towel in general. After we had our discussion before marriage (about 2 years ago now) he got a lot better. He doesn't tiptoe around the issue anymore but it winds up with awkward silence between them when she shuts conversations down.\n\nPersonally, I think she's a little bitter divorce wasn't as great as she imagined it would be and he didn't wait around for her so now she's just doing what she can to retaliate. I'll bring up the possibility of going for full custody with him.", "Ah that explains everything, being itchy always puts me in a bad mood", "Oh sorry I thought it was you who wrote the An* comment. I didn\u2019t realize it was one of those grammar police people. I\u2019ll delete my comment. Sorry for the misunderstanding", "So, here's the thing.  You ignoring her and all is giving her what she wants.  She's provoking this reaction/response from you.   You need to act like this woman is your BEST FRIENNNND!!!!!  Hug her when you see her, tell her it's been way too long since you've seen her last, ask her how she's doing, how is her boyfriend.   Because with you ignoring her, you are looking like the bad guy to other people.  And i promise you she is loving the way she's manipulating you and making you avoid her.  She's got a power high.   \n\n Play her game and fucking win it.  You don't have to invite her out to lunch or anything.  It doesn't have to leave the situation you encounter her in.  Just... create you a character so to speak and treat this woman like you love the shit out of her.  Show her pictures you've taken of the kids on your phone and act excited to share any tiny little tidbit about them with her.   Laugh a lot.  It'll annoy her.  But if she's complaining about you to any of your inlaws or whatever, they are going to say, \"Well (ex), she always seems so delighted to see you\".   \n\nNTA.", ">I'll bring up the possibility of going for full custody with him.\n\nHow is her relationship with her children?
