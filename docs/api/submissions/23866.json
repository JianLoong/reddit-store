I don't expect us to be friends or anything of the sort but I do expect for a grown adult woman to be able to hear \"Sorry I can't take the kids right now because I'm on my way to Razzmatazz's parents, I told you I'd be out of town for a couple of days.\" After our talk, he started using a co-parenting app to communicate with her so it was only about the kids. \n\nThe app worked until it came to wedding planning and making arrangements for the kids.

No answering questions, no responding to statements or her fishing for compliments or her playing nice in front of others. This last event was my in-law's anniversary party. Since the party was during Grumpy's custody time, they invited her. Once again, I ignored her. I guess my mother-in-law noticed because when the party was over she pulled me aside to tell me I had been rude to Grumpy and while she knows she can be a bit much, I need to be the bigger person so Grumpy and my husband can co-parent peacefully. \n\nMy husband feels its a damned if we do, damned if we don't situation so he has no problem with me ignoring her since I don't do it in front of the kids.
