Shortly after we began dating, his ex-wife, let's call her Grumpy, reached out to him about reconciling and getting back together. He refused.

Instead of \"We have plans for today\" he'd go \"I have these plans\". It got to a point I told him I felt like he was hiding me to appease her and was getting fed up with it. I don't expect us to be friends or anything of the sort but I do expect for a grown adult woman to be able to hear \"Sorry I can't take the kids right now because I'm on my way to Razzmatazz's parents, I told you I'd be out of town for a couple of days.\" After our talk, he started using a co-parenting app to communicate with her so it was only about the kids. \n\nThe app worked until it came to wedding planning and making arrangements for the kids. They started using phone calls and talking in person again and it started back up. Tipping point for me was her referring to our wedding as 'their father's big party'. Since the wedding, we've been at events with her four times. If the kids are right there, I speak to her as necessary but otherwise, I flat-out ignore her. No answering questions, no responding to statements or her fishing for compliments or her playing nice in front of others. This last event was my in-law's anniversary party. Since the party was during Grumpy's custody time, they invited her. Once again, I ignored her. I guess my mother-in-law noticed because when the party was over she pulled me aside to tell me I had been rude to Grumpy and while she knows she can be a bit much, I need to be the bigger person so Grumpy and my husband can co-parent peacefully. \n\nMy husband feels its a damned if we do, damned if we don't situation so he has no problem with me ignoring her since I don't do it in front of the kids.

You have no obligation to play nice with someone who obviously hates you.", "You know a healthy way to co-parent would be letting the dad bring the kids to his families events.
