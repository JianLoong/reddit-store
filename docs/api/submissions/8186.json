Rinsing it washes these vitamins away.\n\nThe need to rinse, or soak, rice also varies depending on the exact rice variety.\n\nETA: the preparation varies both by type of rice, and how it will be used.

Americans are not stereotyped abroad for knowing how to grill burgers, you're stereotyped for your guns, expensive medical bills, and racism.", "Heck, even for Americans and burgers, there is no single way to \"traditionally\" prepared a burger.  I've had burgers made with anything from plain, unseasoned ground beef (gross) to having onions, spices, egg and a starch (often breadcrumbs or cooked rice) mixed in before cooking.  Made thin or thick.  Well done, or rare on the inside.  Served on a plain white \"hamburger bun\" roll, on kimmelweck buns, on sliced bread of various types, toasted or not, with a wide variety of toppings (lettuce, tomato, raw or cooked onions, cooked mushrooms, avocado, etc) and a wide variety of condiments (ketchup, mustard, sweet cucumber pickle relish, mayonnaise, gravy, etc.)\n\nAssuming any given American knows the One True Way of making a hamburger is as ridiculous as assuming someone who is part-Asian knows a One True Way of making rice.", "Basically - rinsing rice is so largely *normal* around the world and America is new to the game because we\u2019re privileged to have packaged rice and don\u2019t need to check it as often for bugs or rocks, so we\u2019re like wth are these people doing! Not realizing the intent to wash rice differs but all cultures still wash rice.\n\nFor OP to generalize this normal method to just Asia isn\u2019t okay. And that\u2019s why she\u2019s the AH.", "OP is American and her son learned a technique that isn't common here. True the skill could come from watching content online (like how I learned about washing rice tbh), but it could have very plausibly come from the son's GF. While not unique to Asia, washing rice is something very common in Asia and done by Asian people. I really think it's a stretch to call that racist. It's literally just how people in Asia (and other parts of the world) cook rice.", "Honestly, I think America is doing a lot better than most places in terms of racism and race relations because of our unique history. Being built as a country of immigrants from across the world has forced us to acknowledge our own racist beliefs as a society and work to integrate everyone from every background together. What other countries have such a storied history in civil rights suffering and ultimately victories? I think other countries are seen as less racist only because they are not forced to confront such diversity on a day to day basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso we are 100% stereotyped by over-processed, unhealthy food. What better poster child than a cheeseburger?", "How do you know he learned it from her? That assumption is the racist part (along with the \u2018some part Asian\u2019 as opposed to actually saying her ethnic background/country of origin)."]}
