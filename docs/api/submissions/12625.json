Wow! Thats an expensive nursing degree when you can literally do most of it at a community college and then transfer for the last year or so! \n\nIf he was still going for Engineering, it makes sense to pay that kind of tuition, but not for a nursing degree. \n\nI agree with you on this one, so you are NTA", "Maybe try to get in touch with some of the professors that left. Maybe they can give him some insight. I think he wants to stay more for his friends. NTA. Maybe if he is told this program won't help him if he wants to pursue an advanced degree, he might listen.", "This went in another direction than i thought.\n\nNTA if the school is notoriously bad when it comes to nursing majors, then i understand you dont want to finance it.", "NTA.   You can get ADN to be registered nurse at most community colleges, and then get BS at night.  It is a luxury to pay 25K a semester for nursing.", "I\u2019m going through a program to get my MLT certification, and it\u2019s a dumpster fire.  Most of the original instructors left, so we pretty much have to teach ourselves at this point.  It will a miracle if any of us can pass our certification exam.  And without that certification exam, the degree is USELESS.\n\nDO NOT PAY FOR A FAILING PROGRAM.  If he can\u2019t pass the NCLEX, you\u2019ve spent tens of thousands of dollars for nothing.\n\nIf he wants to learn a very expensive lesson, he can take out loans himself.", "NTA   \nYou aren't telling him what degree or career he has to have. You aren't forcing him to go to college or to drop out. You aren't forcing him to a specific school of your choice. You just want him not to waste his time and you not to waste your money. That's a lot of money to spend on a program that is struggling with finding and keeping professors and has low graduation rates. Again, this is your money and you should have some say. I think your reasons are valid and fair. \n\nI switched my major from vet to occupational therapy when I was in school. Shortly after switching, the OT program director left and the program was a mess for half the time I was there. It made school so much more difficult and I felt cheated out of all the money I was paying.", "NTA. You have a very valid reason. It\u2019s your money. Whether he likes it or not, you have the final say. He can pay for it himself, it\u2019s not like millions of students don\u2019t already do that. So I don\u2019t think you are truly stopping him from doing what he wants.", "NTA if you're willing to pay for his nursing degree at another school. Why not suggest that to him?", "NTA that is a lot of money per semester and I think it is reasonable that he goes to a school that has a good program.", "NTA Like it or not, college is all about return on investment these days. I agree with you wholeheartedly. Nursing is a terrific profession with excellent opportunities, but he needs a good program. Going from engineering to nursing is an odd leap. I wonder what\u2019s driving his decision.", "NTA, which was not what I expected from the title.  \nGood for your son wanting to be a nurse. Good for you, being happy to pay for his college education to be a fine nurse. You're not wrong in wanting him to go to a college with a *good* nursing program. Show him the information and make clear you're happy to keep paying for him to get a nursing degree if he goes to a school where there is a *good* nursing degree. Direct him to where he can research that information.", "[Here is what happens when a nursing school closes.](https://www.wfsb.com/2023/02/16/stone-academy-students-forced-find-new-programs-after-nursing-school-closes-how-make-sure-youre-finding-best-one/) Those schools did not have sufficient teaching staff. It's not pretty. No one knows if any of those students are going to get their money back or be able to get a license. It's terrible. You're wise to encourage him to go to a reliable school.\n\nNTA", "Paying $200K for a BS in nursing would be the dumbest thing you can ever do with your money.\n\nAbsolutely NTA. Tell him you\u2019re not spending $200K when he could go to another school and leave as a nurse anesthetist with that much money.", "NTA - you want to make sure your money is well spent, and college isn\u2019t cheap. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re entitled to pay for his college\u2026 he seems to think you are.", "NTA\n\nYou have made excellent points. Is there another school close enough that he could still hang out with his friends that has a nursing program?", "NTA It sounds like you have no problem with your son being a nurse at all and you have no issue paying for his education. Your issue is that if you are going to pay  for it, you want to make sure he is a school that is good for that program and will afford him the opportunity for a the type of career he wants and that is 100% fair.", "NTA!!!!\n\n\nI taught at a school that had a failing program!!! TELL HIM I APPLAUD YOUR DECISION TO SAFEGUARD HIS FUTURE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES.  Also, if the program fails,  he could have to transfer for his senior year! And it is not a guarantee he'll get in his first choice school coming from a school with a bad reputation.  Tell him to run,  not walk away from that school's nursing program. \n\n\nCould he do his core classes at a community College? Most of my nurse friends started at CC. If he's passionate about nursing,  he should go to the best school he can get into (and that you can afford!).", "NTA, but this is no win. He won't see your side for 15 or 20 years.", "NTA. Put together the information you found that shows it\u2019s not a good nursing program, with info about other (good) programs. Maybe there\u2019s a good school nearby so he doesn\u2019t have to be far from his new friends, but also he\u2019ll make friends in his new program.\n\nExplain your reasoning and feelings as best you can to him, and it\u2019s generous of you to be willing to pay for his schooling.\n\nAlso, keep an open mind\u2014what if he can compile a list of nursing graduates from that program and what they\u2019re doing now, and it looks like there\u2019s no problem getting a job out of that program?", "Usually a parent cutting funding gets the y t a's here, I'm going NTA.\n\nYou want him to succeed, and are supportive of him in his chosen career field, you are still willing to pay for his chosen career field and want him to go to a school that did more than the bare minimum of squeezing by with accreditation.", "NTA\n\nExplain you fully support him going into nursing, but **he will not get any nursing jobs when he graduates from that college**.   And that will be a giant waste of his time and money as a result.\n\nI know he wants to stay with his friends.  But he has to make a hard choice.  Now.  Either he chooses his friends and ruins his entire nursing career, or he leaves his friends and ensures a possible nursing career for himself.  As you, I and most adults know, being an adult means sometimes making hard decisions.  This is one of them.\n\nSadly, as a 19 year old man, he won't listen to your solid reason.  If he's anything like I was at that age, he thinks he knows everything.  The Dunning-Kreuger effect looms large at that age (it does at any age but the less we know about life, the more so).\n\nAs much as I loathe ultimatums 99% of the time, this is a 1% case.  \"Either you change to a school whose nursing program isn't falling apart, or pay for it yourself.\"", "NTA\n\nIn nursing especially a shoddy education can lead to really serious ramifications. He should absolutely transfer to the best possible program he can get into.", "NTA. In my town there are 3-4 colleges that offer nursing degrees. The community college is cheap, but insanely difficult due to the program and professors being overall very disorganized and poor educators. (Not a dig at community colleges in general. This one just happens to have a weird nursing program). I have numerous friends and colleagues who managed to graduate tell me horror stories. I chose a nursing program at one of the private colleges; it\u2019s very expensive but the class sizes are small and I got tons of free help from tutors and my professors. Given that I\u2019ve struggled with late-diagnosed ADHD, the flawlessly organized curriculum and readily-available help is literally the only reason I was able to make it academically. Nursing school is hard; it\u2019s like drinking out of a fire hose as it is. Bad or poorly organized curriculums and educators costs the world too many otherwise amazing nurses. I got what I paid for and had an amazing experience. \n\nNothing wrong with paying more for a better college experience in my opinion, but paying more for an objectively bad, difficult time toward an already difficult degree? Nah, I\u2019m on your side here.", "NTA\n\nYou're not objecting to his decision to be a nurse. You're simply saying that you'll only pay for a decent program.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
