This one just happens to have a weird nursing program). I have numerous friends and colleagues who managed to graduate tell me horror stories. They hated their college experience there. I chose a nursing program at one of the private colleges; it\u2019s very expensive but the class sizes are small and I got tons of free help from tutors and my professors. Given that I\u2019ve struggled with late-diagnosed ADHD, the flawlessly organized curriculum and readily-available help is likely the reason I was able to do well academically. Nursing school is hard; it\u2019s like drinking out of a fire hose as it is. Bad or poorly organized curriculums and educators costs the world too many otherwise amazing nurses.
