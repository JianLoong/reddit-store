It is possible she was raised in a house with a similar mindset. \n\nI don't leave my toothbrush or contacts or tampons out, in the same way I wouldn't leave a pile of used towels on the floor when having company over. They shouldn't have to work around all my crap to wash their hands or get a tissue. It isn't like I'm hiding the fact that I own menstrual products, but I can live without them in arms reach of the toilet for a night.\n\nIt sounds like she was raised with a lot of shame around femininity and menstruation, and that sucks. It also sucks that she's potentially passing that fear and shame on to a kid. Those hang-ups are not your fault, she was def rude to you over it.", "NTA look at the bright side you just spent 3 years to avoid being married to your bf and his family this is a sign of a larger issue if he's not on your side.", "NTA.  Surprise, some people use tampons.  Why did she bring her kid without asking first?", "What the actual fuck? No, you are definitely not the AH. NTA. \nThat\u2019s utterly bizarre!

NTA", "She's a drama queen.  It's not like it was a sex toy or condoms or like they were used.  To me this is no different than someone freaking out over seeing a box of toilet paper sitting out in the bathroom.  Freaking out over the men seeing them is real icing on the cake too.  Some guys in sports even use them too, for nosebleeds.  NTA.", "NTA. That is your home, your bathroom. She sounds like she's got some internalized misogyny going on to think that a natural thing is so disgusting that you need to hide all traces that you menstruate.", "NTA - There's no universe where her actions are even a little bit excusable. I'd have thrown her out too.\n\nI'd also put a little pin in my assumptions about my bf if he thinks this was ok. Seems like a yellow flag at the least.", "NTA. No wonder she was going to be alone for Christmas. She's a drama queen. If she's so put off by a visible box of tampons, why would she bring them out and show everyone and freak out about it? She just wanted attention.", "NTA and I\u2019d rethink the relationship. I\u2019ve had emergencies where my husband had to grab tampons for me\u2026and this occurred when we were dating too. So, will he never buy tampons for you if you need them??!! All of these people need to grow up. She has a son, but he should also learn about periods in a few years\u2026it\u2019s dumb people don\u2019t teach boys about this too.", "Period troll", "jesus, wtf? why is everyone so afraid of periods? it\u2019s as natural as giving birth\u2026even more so because even if you don\u2019t want kids you still get it. when we treat it like it doesn\u2019t exist, it becomes even more shameful as time goes on. that\u2019s not fair at all!", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s a box of unused tampons, she was being a drama llama.", "NTA\n\nTampons are nothing to hide.

What an AH, your bf and his brother too.", "NTA.\nI find it funny when people are invited into someone else\u2019s home and then have the audacity to freak out about something like this.  She is a grown woman who acted like a child.  \n\nYou were not in the wrong for telling her if she didn\u2019t like it then she should leave.  Fact of the matter is, she wasn\u2019t even originally invited.  Her son wasn\u2019t invited nor supposed to be there.  You were gracious enough to open your home to her and her son, and she acted like a fool.\n\nIf I were you I would be very disappointed in Ian.  You should feel free to express yourself in your own home, especially when being attacked by someone you have only known for 3 months.  He should have stood up for you.", "NTA\u2014this stranger came to your house and insulted you. She\u2019s hardly a member of the family after 3 months of dating your boyfriend\u2019s brother. If she was genuinely concerned about her child seeing the tampons, then she wouldn\u2019t have walked out waving them in the air and screaming.", "Absolutely NTA. When I have guests over I make sure that there are some hygiene products out where women guests can get them if they have an emergency (just as I have extra toilet paper and hand towels). You weren't expecting a child there [also, a child would either not know what they are yet or would so NBD]. If the men have never bought any as part of the shopping list with/for their girl, they will... or at least they should. People who are performatively squeamish about something that happens for most of the life of half the population just want attention.", "NTA\n\nThey were unused and nicely in the box so there\u2019s nothing to get upset about. Had they been qtips would she have gotten all upset knowing that those also go inside people\u2019s bodies? Had they been all bloody and strewn about the bathroom I can understand her being upset but that\u2019s not what happened. \n\nAlso you said you\u2019ve been with your boyfriend for 3 years so I\u2019m assuming he knows what tampons are and what they do so that whole thing about \u201cleaving them out in front of men\u201d doesn\u2019t hold up. \n\nPlus it\u2019s your home and you can put the tampons where you want. I actually think that was being polite on your behalf. Your not supposed to dig through other people\u2019s drawers when visiting somebody else\u2019s home. What if Naveah had started her period? You graciously put the tampons out so she could use them if need be. \n \nI\u2019m doubting the kid even noticed them if he went in there as that\u2019s the last thing on a little boy\u2019s mind. But mom screaming about it will make him want to go check it out for sure.", "NTA", "WTF. What a weird scene to make. That girl is insane. NTA.", "NTA. She proceeds to bring the box out in front of all the guys and children.", "NTA.  \nIt wasn't an issue until she came raging out of the bathroom, and I'd be surprised if an 8 year old even knew what they were for.  \nSounds like someone had a repressed childhood.", "NTA You may want to reconsider the bf you have if he isn't willing to take your side on this. You are under no obligation to apologize or feel sorry for your actions. It was her choice to leave over a very stupid reason.", "NTA\n\nAnd not the asshole for having your tampons out. I don't understand why people (read \"men\") freaknout about tampoms, pads, sponges. Women wash their fuckin jocks! (I habe 3 brothers. Wayyy too many jocks in the wash!) And underwear! They got used to seeing tampons, etc., right quick w/ 3 sisters & mom!", "NTA. It's a completely normal thing to have at hand in your bathroom. If you apply the logic that tampons are gross because of what's done with them, by the same logic it's gross to keep toilet paper somewhere where people can see it. We do wipe shit from our arse into it after all.", "NTA. We\u2019re not in the era anymore where we don\u2019t talk about women\u2019s menstruation and forbid, someone\u2019s sensibilities are offended.  This isn\u2019t sexual, and deals with hygiene matters that occur on a monthly basis.", "NTA! That is some childishly creepy behavior.", "NTA. What does she do when she is in her period? Does her kid not know what is going on? I 100% knew that it was only for females at that age.", "NTA. Why didn't she freak out over the toilet paper? Internalized misogyny is so sad.", "NTA\n\nSIL sounds unhinged. Her reaction was crazy and excessive. It's not like you smeared a used tampon on her's child face.\n\nBESIDES, it's the second time I read about someone being invited and bringing unannounced choldren. Very rude, you always ask the host.", "NTA but everyone else is and if Ian would be my boyfriend, i would have a serious conversation about this. Wtf they are tampons and women need them.", "NTA But your bf, Jake and Naveah are. Who shrieks over unused tampons? If she can't handle being a guest (which includes not calling your host \"shameless\" and \"disgusting\" while creating a scene then yeah go the hell home.", "NTA there is nothing wrong with having tampons in your own house. Would she say the same about toilet paper? Band-aids? A toothbrush? It\u2019s all the same.", "Nta her reaction is so weird", "NTA. I don\u2019t know how she was brought up to have this reaction, because it\u2019s sad a woman would feel this way. But period shaming is disgusting no matter who it comes from.\n\nIf you felt so inclined, you may reach out to ask why she has such strong feelings against period products and advocate for a shame-free mentality. But you have no obligation to do so. \n\nThe men have no excuse. Who are they to opine about how you keep your own home, let alone how you handle products that have to do with a natural and unavoidable bodily function. You didn\u2019t elect to have a period monthly until menopause. There should be no shame involved with it. \n\nWas your BF upset at what he saw as poor treatment of a guest? Or at the period products? I hope it\u2019s the former, even though he would still be wrong. \n\nIs he ashamed of other reproductive parts of you also? Does he realize that a uterus may bless him with children one day? Does that bring him shame? Or is it only periods that must be deemed shameful. Sorry, I\u2019m now venting. Regardless, if he has a problem with tampons being out, though, that\u2019s a red flag, imo.", "NTA. If having tampons visible in a bathroom is embarrassing, isn't bringing said tampons into the living room for more people to see an even more embarrassing situation? It makes no sense that she'll make such a huge scene.", "I mean, if you had used ones lying around , that\u2019s gross. A box of supplies - NTA!", " Nta\n\nWhere i live it us common practice to put some tampons and or pads om display in the bathroom that guests will use. \n\nThis and a trashcan with a lid for discretion. \n\n\nYou\u2019re response could be considered a bit rude or direct, but she was being very rude too.", "NTA. Her reaction was absolutely ridiculous and it's not her house. If she had maybe approached you calmly and discreetly and asked you to just hide them from sight while her and her kid are there, maybe it wouldn't have been so bad.

Either way, NTA and she's a bit crazy.", "NTA your house your rules i don\u2019t understand how people don\u2019t get that. why should you be \u201csorry\u201d that the tampons were out your right easy access it also isn\u2019t obvious what they are. it makes me wonder how controlling she is with her kid i bless there heart. you did absolutely nothing wrong and if they have a problem you dealt with it correctly you asked them to leave. good job on you Op", "NTA", "NTA- anybody who thinks you're the asshole here are children with no experience with reality.", "NTA and she sounds seriously mentally unstable. Wow.", "You're NTA. Naveah wanted to have today be about her and she's succeeded. Also, politely ask Jake to leave so you talk to Ian about not having your back. If he's going to side with someone he's known for three months over someone he's dated for three years, he needs a damn good explanation. If he can't deal with the hygienic needs of a sexually mature woman I think he should probably not get any of the benefits either.", "NTA, it\u2019s a basic bodily function, she needs therapy.", "NTA, and that is from someone with two sisters and a mom who would get their periods at the same time. I knew from an early age what a period was and that girls get it. It wasn\u2019t a big deal and I always look at people with a side eye who act like it\u2019s a weird thing. Hell, more then once my mom would send me to the store to buy pads/tampons because they ran out. It wasn\u2019t embarrassing except their like a dozen different kinds and I had no idea which ones they wanted. In my opinion, she\u2019s raising that boy to think periods are this bad thing but that\u2019s on her. I wouldn\u2019t apologize and she over reacted in your house.

And if someone chucked them under my sink, I'd be pissed.", "Meanwhile I have things like that out for easy access to guests that may have an unexpected situation- it\u2019s a basic fact of life for half the population at some point in their life, unless we also need to hide the toilet paper and hand soap I think it\u2019s fine to have pads and/or tampons visible and anyone with that big of a reaction better not watch tv or video sites or walk through a store or they may put themselves in the hospital", "This is dumb.\n\nI leave hygenine products out for my period having friends so they don't have to come fetch me and ask if they are caught at my place, unaware and need a tampon/pad.\n\nWhich is worse, leaving products neatly in case my friends need them, or making my friends dig through my cabinets/drawers?", "Having tampons out for guest use is appreciated.", "Succinctly put \ud83d\ude00", "There is no reason that OP should remove her tampons from her own bathroom. The rest I agree with.", "I would never validate such a ridiculous reaction by acquiescing to her. That was unreasonable, and it shouldn't be reinforced by giving her her way.", "No need to keep the empty box. You can't really just let tampons run out. When they're gone, you buy more.", "I keep pads and tampons out in a basket in our guest bathroom. I don\u2019t want my guests feeling they have to search through my bathroom in an emergency in which they\u2019re probably already uncomfortable. I also keep lotion, hand sanitizer, and mouthwash. It\u2019s weird to me that other people find this uncomfortable.", "If they\u2019re unused, then they can be anywhere- good job making sure your AFAB guests have something in an emergency", "That\u2019s an awesome thing to do :) \nWe have a \u201cMenstruation Station\u201d at my work. Little shelf with products on and a sign saying \u201ctake what you need\u201d \nIt\u2019s a mostly female workplace, but I can\u2019t imagine the blokes causing such a scene about it, nevermind other women!", "Also it\u2019s literally your house?", "Right? They\u2019re basically just nicely packaged cotton balls.", "Maybe she doesn't menstruate, so has never known how it is. Or maybe she's bought into the myth that tampons are also sexual objects. If I had someone react that way, I'd make sure to leave a tampon box everywhere.", "She should hide the toilet paper too /s", "drama llama I like that 1", "Was there a reason she went to DefCon One, acting like she found a smoking crack pipe?\n\n\n\n\n> \n>", "Children that she didn\u2019t give a heads up about for the dinner count\u2026\n\nIDK why anyone would think someone screaming and shouting over unused bathroom products is good guest behavior\u2026 did she hide her kid\u2019s diapers back when they were being used???", "My thoughts exactly. If visible tampons are so terrible, why being more attention to them?", "Tampons?!?!? I\u2019m shocked, I tell ya, simply SHOCKED!!! \ud83e\udd23", "Ian is her BF.", "Anyone who throws a fit in my house is welcome to see their self out the door because I don\u2019t have any patience for that nonsense.  If she had been politely concerned vs screaming then it would be a bit excessive, but otherwise it was fairly restrained.", ">You could have handled it better.\n\nYeah, Op could have called the police on her or maybe called some sort of extraterrestrial/ alien removal experts to remove the strange woman. \n\nYes, I agree. Op could have handled it better. \ud83d\ude12", "I was aware of that. It\u2019s a spite move I was pushing for because there\u2019s no other reason OP would keep the box.", "I would get a large picture of a box of tampons framed and hung in a common area and then invited her back over. Make a bouquet of tampon roses and have them as a centerpiece. Make flip flops out of pads and wear them. Just go all out with feminine hygiene themed decor.", "The more boxes the better. Empty and full, lining the whole bathroom wall.", "Keep the box and use it to hold pens and pencils, loose change, whatever. Keep ALL the e pty boxes. Put flowers in them. Use them for decor.", "Hahaha I\u2019m just imagining her walking in to the bathroom and there\u2019s just tampons EVERYWHERE. Glued to the mirror, hanging from the lights. You can\u2019t even see the walls for tampons \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
