For several reasons but mostly for the baby, I have decided to wait until the baby is born to take SSRI anti depressants as I don\u2019t want to subject my newborn to withdrawals. \n\nI have been warned that the depression may get worse, especially after he is born. I will also be having a repeat c-section so I will be post surgery and starting on new medication which can take weeks to take a full effect. I also have an energetic 20 month old and I am self employed. \n\nMy husband was planning on going to his BIL to be stag (bachelor) party in Amsterdam about 5/6 weeks after the baby is born, initially just for one night. I felt somewhat ok about that, but now he has decided on 2 nights (& 3days). \n\nI\u2019ve really been struggling lately, and I have no patience with my toddler and on occasion have had to walk out of the room feeling like panic attacks are coming on, all symptoms of the depression. I dread spending time alone her and feel such horrible guilt about it and I also have pretty bad insomnia for the last 2 months so I\u2019m exhausted. \n\nMy main fear is that I just won\u2019t be able to cope with a newborn and toddler for 3 days without my husband. It isn\u2019t the same having my mom come over to help out. Anyway, my husband is mad now that I didn\u2019t tell him all this and he thinks I\u2019m just being insecure about him going to Amsterdam. I used to be that way but I\u2019ve changed, I\u2019m more worried about my ability to cope and the panic attacks are scary. Plus all the what ifs of this pregnancy.\n\nBTW his sisters and BILs wedding is 2/3 weeks after this stag in Spain so he will be going abroad for that but he will be bringing our 2 year old with him so I think it will be easier to cope then\u2026", "created_utc": 1673893862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dnd1u/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husband_to_go_away_for_3/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Check with your doctor now about weight limitations for lifting now.\n\nOne day and a night away seems reasonable, if you have other adult help in the house for most of that time. More than that seems risky.\n\nMaybe your doctor or some other health care professional can speak to your husband about exactly what your physical limitations will be after major surgery. He should be listening to you, but clearly he isn\u2019t.\n\nAnd even without the surgery, leaving someone alone with a new or and a toddler for very long is just not a good idea. Add a n your new diagnosis and it seems to me your husband is trying very hard to pretend everything is normal and all right, when clearly it is not.", "NTA. The first days and weeks post birth is prob the most important time of your marriage to be together and care for each other and your newborn. I can't think of almost any reason other than the death of a parent or another child as a reason why it would be acceptable to miss that time frame with your wife and child.", "You\u2019re NTA in the slightest, and honestly it\u2019s pretty shocking that your husband would even be considering this stag weekend in the first place.\n\nEven without the recovery time from your c-section and mental health complications, leaving you with a newborn and a toddler is really not on. Now that he knows you\u2019ll have a long post-op recovery and that you\u2019re also suffering from perinatal depression and are likely to have post natal depression, I\u2019m astounded that he hasn\u2019t already cancelled leaving you to go to the wedding.\n\nOP, the fact that you were scared to tell him is really concerning. He should be the first person you turn to for support, not someone you need to hide your feelings from.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019re going though, and I would urge you to tell someone you trust what\u2019s going on. I\u2019d also strongly suggest that you tell your midwife or doctor about your concerns - they may be able to refer you for some extra help both with your mental health and support in your home life.\n\nThe bottom line is that you shouldn\u2019t be going though this alone, and your husband shouldn\u2019t be adding to your stress and panic.", "NTA - Frankly it's really irresponsible if he leaves you alone at home for 3 days with a toddler and a newborn just weeks post-op. Just one night would be a different thing but seeing as he'll be away for what I'm assuming will also be a couple days to be at the wedding, he should get over it and stay at home with you. Of course it's sad that he'll miss the bachelor party but this is his time to step up and support his young growing family - plus there will be plenty of time to catch up and party with his BIL at the wedding and also when your kids are a bit older.", "NTA Surely at absolute minimum the first couple of weeks of a new borns life is \"all hands on deck\" time for both parents.\n\nEspecially when one parent is recovering from a procedure as serious as a c section", "NTA - at 5 weeks post op you don\u2019t even know if you can safely lift your baby, let alone a toddler.", "NTA\nHe needs to dad (parent) up.\n\nIf he's not going to prioritize u (which he should) he absolutely should prioritize his kids.", "NTA- he needs to support you and understand this isn't about you being insecure. This is about him doing what he's supposed to do to support his family. Going away when your wife just had a baby, will be struggling with her mental health, on top of healing from surgery AND taking care of 2 children is negligent on his part IMO. He needs to get over his desire to have fun, his family is more important. Are you seeing a therapist? If you are, I think it would be a good idea to have them explain to your husband how much him leaving will effect you, your mental health and your children. Unforatetly it sounds like he will not take it seriously coming from you but perhaps will if it's coming from a professional", "NTA, in the first week, will not be able to take care of yourself, imagine a toddler, this is a health risk for you both... What if you need to return to the hospital? Who will cook, bathe, and take care of the older child?

It doesn't matters if is a party with prostitutes in Amsterdam, or a mass with the pope... You should be the one being upset, very upset... He is providing by actions that he doesn't care about you.", "NTA.\n\nYou're already handling a lot and he can share some of that too. Being a parent is also learning to sacrifice wants. Your partner should realise sooner than later that wanting to go to a stag is not more important than supporting his family and partner. Best of luck OP.", "NTA.\n\nEven if you'd have had a fully natural birth with no complications and no emotional difficulties you'd still be exhausted - trying to deal with a small fragile creature that lives on something like a 2-hour lifecycle is not something you should have to do alone for even one night, and that's not even counting having to care for a toddler as well. I remember when my wife had our first child, she and I were shambling zombies for the first two or three months; there's no way I would have left her alone to deal with that.", "NTA. a month and a half is not enough for you to fully recover from such a traumatic procedure all while taking care of your baby and toddler and battling depression. and a LOT can happen in 3 days. his reaction is so disappointing, how clueless does one have to be to not figure out that you're not doing well, and that he has to step up to keep things in order? dismissing your worries like that is so disrespectful...", "NTA - but you are a small YTA for not communicating, all relationships require work and communication you must be open with him and him open with you. It's difficult but you must speak to each other. Having your molum help you is never the same but we made do because that's how humans work we push forward. \n\nYou will have dark days and that's okay too but please be open about them so your husband and family can offer you the support you need. \n\nI'm not a mum yet and I'm both dreading it and excited about it, because I am at higher risk for forms of depression as I already suffer from other mental health issues. \n\nRemember you are not alone, even in your darkest days", "Um, I\u2019m confused. It sounds like your mom could come and help, but it seems you are saying you need your husband instead. I\u2019m not sure I understand that. Why is your mom not good enough to help out? Honestly, I always preferred my mom\u2019s help over my husband with the kids. That\u2019s my personal choice, I understand, but if you have the option of getting help from your mom during that time, why reject it?", "NTA. If he does go anyway, I hope you have family or friends who can be around to help you. Dealing with a newborn and a toddler at the same time is a lot even in the best of circumstances.", "NTA if he insists on going, he should set up someone to stay with you for the duration he will be gone.", "NTA.  You already are losing patience with your toddler.  Toddlers are a nightmare of fight club, trying to do themselves in, and pushing every last button a parent has.  The only alternative so can think of would be can the grandparents take care of the toddler while he is gone?  I mean take the toddler to their house so it\u2019s only you and baby.  That would give you a bit of a break and time to focus on rest whenever you could get it and baby when needed.", "NTA - he is an equal parent and has equal responsibility. He doesn\u2019t get to just nope out for a party and leave you shoulder everything alone. You\u2019ve already sacrificed more than your fair share for the pregnancy, this is his turn.", "The question really is then for you, at what point will you and your husband be able to venture out on your own to engage in an activity?\n\nyou indicate 5-6 weeks after the baby is born he wants to go away for a couple of days\n\nyou're not talking about 5 or 6 days after", "YTA\n\nYeah, not a popular opinion it seems. But I think you are being unreasonable right now, probably because of the combined stresses of everything you are going through.\n\nIt's a weekend trip, months away, and you will have someone else there to help you while he is gone.\n\nBecause of your poor communication about how you are feeling, it really, really seems like you are making up an excuse to not let him go because you are worried he'll behave inappropriately in Amsterdam. *I'm not even sure* that isn't what this actually is, so I imagine for him it seems even more like that.", "[deleted]", "YTA, get this pregnancy remediated and rehome the first one.
