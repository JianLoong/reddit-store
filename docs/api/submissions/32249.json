So my short take in response to the early comments definitely lacks the nuisance of some of the more recent ones. I'd go to them and ignore this one personally, especially since more details have come out after I wrote this that give more on OPs character. \n\nFirstly, poor bio-daughter, sounds like she's going through a horrible time and it's nice his parents are helping here. While I stand by (in my personal opinion) that I view the initial part as a sort of sperm donation / faux adoption and therefore they shouldn't have gotten involved until the bio-daughter reached out of her own accord. It sounds like they are doing a great job for her at the present.\n\nOP, you seem to have a HUGE amount of resentment here which, to a degree, is understandable but the girl is going through a hard time so I'd try to show some empathy here. Your family has 100% gone team bio-daughter and if having her around at all breaks hard boundaries for you then move on. While I believe you have no obligation to be her father I'd say you do have an obligation to not make her life harder (like any child).\n\nUpdating my judgement above accordingly to NTA very early on in life, ESH on the night.

Nah, I don't think so but who knows\" type of thing. \n\nGiven that you've clarified that the \"she\" in the post is the kid, you seem to have a lot of hate and anger towards a 14 year old.... And your family (who presumably knows quite a bit more about you than reddit) seems to have very strongly aligned themselves with the kid, not you, which is telling. \n\nRelevant info that is needed: what was abortion access like where you lived 14 years ago? Was it safe legal and relatively destigmatized? You said you were 18, was your gf also 18 (if she was under 18, her parents might have played a role in the decisions she was able to make)?

You chose to attempt to freeze her out from them and to have no contact with a baby that you were ultimately responsible for making (the whole \"she got pregnant\" line was the first red flag in your post. She didn't do it by herself). You chose to make your family choose and they chose the person who wasn't being a world class AH. And why wouldn't they? Emotionally abandoning a child, even if it wasn't initially wanted, is pretty heartless. Even the most minor of interactions throughout her life (out for lunch occasionally, remembering to send a birthday present, etc ) would help make her feel wanted and valued as a person. But clearly what you want out of life is the only thing that matters. Forget that pretty much nobody gets exactly what they want out of life, or that responsibility exists whether you asked for it or not. Other than financially you turned your back on a baby, who is understandably bitter about that now that she's grown.

That kind of thinking was dumb (no birth control except abstinence is 100% effective and the pill has about a 10% failure rate, so if you *really* don't want kids, you should have doubled up by using a condom as well instead of making your gf solely responsible for prevention), but hey, you were 17/18, so being dumb doesn't make you an AH.

Your daughter definitely needs therapy given how you've treated her and that now her mother is so sick she can't even live with her, but damn - I think you might need it more, given that you're 32 years old and still have teenager-level resentment and antipathy towards an actual child.", "Stop the N--T-A''s HE IS THE AH, the kid lives with his parents because her mom is sick and all he can think about is 'nobody likes me' ofc nobody likes you, you're an awful person. \n\nThis kid is already in the world, you can't be childfree anymore genius, but ok, you don't want anything.

I agree, now that OP has lived through this experience, that a vasectomy is probably a good idea for him. People suggesting that he should have made that choice before he became a father at 18 is ridiculous.

People think they can tell you to be a parent when you don\u2019t want to be, then be mad at you when you don\u2019t behave like a loving parent when you don\u2019t love the kid? It\u2019s insane, I get there are people who will set themselves on fire to keep any child warm because \u201cchildren are innocent\u201d, but not everyone is like that, and that\u2019s okay. It doesn\u2019t make you a bad person no matter what the Reddit hive mind says. \n\nKeep paying child support as that\u2019s the right thing to do. I\u2019d also strongly suggest you tell her (not in person) that it\u2019s not her fault as kids tend to think that it\u2019s their fault mom/dad doesn\u2019t want me. Let her know that lots of people love her and want her. But your feelings aren\u2019t wrong.", "Yup. I fucking hate that. Sex is a 2 way street and women rightly get to choose whether they want to have a kid or not, but once that kid is in the world suddenly the sperm donor is responsible for a choice he didn't get to make. Every one of these \"he should've kept it in his pants\" people should be ashamed of themselves."]}
