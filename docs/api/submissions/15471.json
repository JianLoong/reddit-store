That is emotional abuse and not okay at all. There is something wrong there, how long have you been together? He embarrassed himself he started the fight you were helping him out and yet he still had the audacity to fight with you. His behavior was disgusting and meant to tear you down. I am worried for you honestly. How is he when he is at his maddest point with you?", "NTA and are you safe? \n\nPlease re-evaluate this relationship. You deserve better.", "Sounds like he is an AH and has a drinking problem. Run!", "NTA. This sounds like a relationship/person that you need to escape asap.", "NTA Your bf sounds abusive, though, due to him literally verbally & emotionally abusing you. Your plan made sense, but he threw a fit because he couldn't get more alcohol first, which also leads me to believe he's an alcoholic or at least has alcohol issues. There was zero need for him to behave that way. \n\n*You* didn't embarrass him. His behavior had a consequence, but not one strong enough to cause him any change. Instead, he's abusing you more because you didn't play happy for his family. \n\nPlease realize that you deserve better than this & get out of this relationship. This isn't how a good partner treats their partner nor how a healthy relationship should be.", "Sounds like you are being seriously disrespected. OP, I would reassess the relationship and set hard boundaries. NTA.", "NTA. Listen very carefully: He is an alcoholic and he is abusive. HE, at this point in his life, loves alcohol more than you and his children. I'm not going to say that you should leave, but you need to take a good hard look at this relationship and think about if it's worth staying with him until he realizes he's an alcoholic. IDK how long you've been together, but expect more of this before it gets better at all.", "NTA. This guy is manipulative and abusive, and will get worse.", "NTA your SO sucks major doody.", "NTA and you need to leave his ass", "NTA but why are you still with this a-hoke if this is a pattern of behaviour?! He sounds dreadful and you deserve better. You absolutely should have left and not gone back btw.", "NTA. Abuse and disrespect.  How long have you been with him, and how long do you want to be with him?", "NTA\u2014 but wow this partner of yours is an asshole. He speaks badly to you and then blames you for how that makes him look? What an ass.", "NTA\n\nWhy are you with him?\n\nYou should be pissed of at him for the way he acted!", "NTA. This is a ton of red flags and I suggest you tell him he needs therapy to deal with his issues and anger and leave him. Seriously. Leave him. He doesn't respect you and he clearly prioritizes himself over you AND the kids.", "OP, everyone so far feels your SO is an AH and not you. But you have added an edit that seems to defend or justify his behavior. Yeesh. No one thinks you were in the wrong, here.", "NTA at all. But you will be to yourself if you stay in this relationship.", "Honey, why are you still married to this abusive alcoholic?\n\nNTA, but please consider leaving him. This is not what a healthy loving marriage looks like.", "NTA. He is an abusive prick though.

Omg, he's literally berating you in front if his kids and even claims prioritizing his male child is \"undermining\" him! Listen to yourself! Does that sound like something a sane and rational parent would do and say? What is he bringing to the table that's worth all this abuse? You deserve so much better then this abusive alcoholic!", "NTA omg he is abusive dear..pls seek individual counseling.", "NTA. Girl, you gotta get out of this relationship.

That tells you *everything* you need to know about the type of man he *REALLY* is. Drinking just causes the mask to slip for a bit. Deep down, this is a man who sees you as beneath him, someone to obey his demands. And who feels that his booze is more important that his son.

He picked a fight over nothing and blames you when he is the one who embarrassed himself. Drinking doesn't change who we are. It just lowers our inhibitions. He is mean spirited all the time but controls it better when he is sober.\n\nHe is abusive verbally and mentally. He is someone that needs to be alone for the rest of his days.

I\u2019m worried he may become physical in the future, a lot of the time it just gets worse and worse unless they are made accountable! You need to keep track of your fights like this and go to him with these concerns and set boundaries and if he can\u2019t change you need to leave and show him you will not be in his life if he does not treat you with respect.
