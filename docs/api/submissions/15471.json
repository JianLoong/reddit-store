Because... nah, you deserve better", "Nta dude, sounds like he's abusive. Serious question: do you want this to be your life?

If he gets angry every time you choose to delay him procuring alcohol, I can\u2019t help but wonder when he\u2019ll go from loud to actually violent. \n\nHe needs help, and you need to leave him.", "NTA. you are in an abusive relationship. get out & call CPS for the kids sake. they\u2019re being emotionally abused too", "And you are still with this guy. Ok.  You\u2019re an asshole to yourself.", "Nta. You are being emotionally abused and should walk away. I'm sorry for your pain.", "Hey OP? Leave this guy.

His family knew right away that he did something to upset you, because it is apparently his MO to rage and abuse people around him. He literally got angry over NOTHING. He still got is alcohol, right? But because it was five minutes later than he wanted, he used that to rage at you and his kids. And yes, if he is raging at you in front of his kids, he may as well rage at them. They are traumatized either way.\n\nHe is one angry dude, and he\u2019ll use any fucking excuse to rage at you and make himself the victim. \u2018Undermining\u2018 just means he didn\u2019t get his way FOR FIVE MINUTES. Think about that. \n\nI don\u2019t know how long you have been with this man, but do you really see a future with him? Imagine dealing with this for ten or twenty years.

He will always have a reason to be angry, and you\u2019ll never know just when he decides to lash out and punish you for it.\n\nI hope his kids have other adults in their life besides their father.

But you teach people how to treat you and you're continuing to allow him to mentally and verbally abuse you in front of his children no less, why? Bc he hasn't hit you yet? Bc it's only when he drinks? \n\nNo he is an abusive man, who tells you how he honestly regards you when he has his drunk outburst, who believes you're too weak to leave.\n\nNot to mention you and he are doing a huge disservice by pretending your relationship is the norm to his kids. They are growing up thinking it's normal for ppl who are \"in love\" to hate and berate the other partner but it's ok bc they're drunk this time. \n\nReally sit back and think on this one.", "Dump him.

I adored his daughter and he and his ex were just a hit mess.  The little girl was a sewwt decent human being and just everything they weren't.  I stayed with him longer that i should have because I liked being a stable factor in her life.  I realized I was slowly killing myself and left.  It hurt to do it but  I had to.

He needs therapy and probably to quit drinking for a while. If he isn\u2019t willing to do this, you need to leave him for your own sake. Also, it isn\u2019t your responsibility to put yourself in a toxic, harmful situation for the sake of kids that aren\u2019t yours. That might seem harsh, but it\u2019s a good lesson to learn that you can\u2019t rescue everyone.\n\nFYI, someone does not need to be a daily drinker to have a drinking problem. If he behaves aggressively and says degrading things to you when he drinks, he has problems and needs to get help. Drunk words tell sober thoughts.

Better men and better relationships are out there. \n\nI know you feel bad for the kids, but you can\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep them warm.

This is the guy mind you, that can't wait 5 minutes for you to drive by a school before his next drink.  This is the guy that felt 'undermined' because you prioritized a child for FIVE minutes over him and his next drink.  You are NTA, and you did NOT embarrass your BF.  Your BF's family are enablers that think he is the funny mean drunk.  I'm guessing they are drunks also.  I'm a drinker of 40+ years and believe you need to get away from this person and this situation.", "And he knows that\n\nYou can be social with the kids even after you break up.", "Your bf is an alcoholic. Im not a doc, either- I\u2019m a nurse. \n\nAlso he\u2019s probably drinking more and you don\u2019t see it. \n\nRegardless, his behavior is a problem and he is choosing to drink and behave badly.

Normal people don\u2019t see a different opinion about what to do as a challenge to their authority (because he is not an authority over you- you\u2019re a grown ass adult!)\n\nIf you keep dating this guy, you are choosing these problems.
