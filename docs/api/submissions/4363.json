You are exactly right in your diagnosis of what he's doing I used to have a partner who always accused me of being indecisive but never once agreed with the decision I made it's a weird power play that some people do. So definitely go into this confrontation knowing you're right and try pointing out to him that you've made multiple decisions he didn't agree with so there's no way you could be labeled as indecisive he's just disagreeable.", "\"I am decisive. I decided on this, and I've told you. For some reason, you don't want that so it's on you to make a counter-offer.\" \n\nNTA.", "Wait, what???? He complains you\u2019re indecisive, yet when you work on yourself and make a decision, he nixes it AND your next decision? Then gets mad that you are \u201cmaking\u201d him do all the work? Honey, you do what you want to do, but don\u2019t tolerate that bullshit. He\u2019s playing you. If you stick around, this is what you\u2019re going to deal with unless and until he\u2019s ready to change. NTA", "NTA he is so childish maybe it's time for you to move on from him.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t being indecisive here. He sounds exhausting", "NTA. This was literally the polar opposite of indecision. You were very, very decisive. Tbh the way he\u2019s gaslighting you with this makes me wonder if you were ever that indecisive at all\u2026", "Nta. Sounds like you are being reasonable and have tried to compromise. I feel like anyone would have handled it the way you did. I'd confront him when you are calm and say it like you did in this post.", "NTA You have made multiple solid decisions. Definitely gaslighting. Is he like this a lot? He sounds like someone you should decide to leave.", "You gave him two options and he didn't like either  of them. At this point, it's not unreasonable to throw the ball to his side of the court \n\nNTA", "If you have presented two options which HE, alone, rejected, then he is the a-hole, as you are not being indecisive.  Him not liking the options does NOT mean you are indecisive.\n\nThe only possible exception is if those places have something in common that are previously identified as deal-breaker things.  But remember, deal-breakers should generally be material, on not superficial preferences, however.  Common deal-breakers might be:  the hotel is outside of your agreed-upon budget, or it's in a part of the vacation location that is unsafe, or it only gets 1 star on Trip-Advisor.  Preferences might be:  having a hotel with a continental breakfast, or free parking, or closer to a preferred beach.  Of course, preferences can be deal-breakers, but if you have not established that, then he cannot complain.", "Does he understand the meaning of decisive?

That being said, I also am indecisive re: hotels and have analysis paralysis.  I always book multiple hotels, make a spreadsheet with pros/cons and then whittle down the list.  I never book non-refundable hotels either!  I am ok with non-refundable airline tix, but being locked into a hotel freaks me out, lol.\n\nWhy not book a few options that can be cancelled that you are happy with in the event your boyfriend doesn't come through and you will be staying somewhere you will be happy.", "NTA. Your analysis is right. He wants you to plan it, then him veto all your decisions, then him act like it's your fault & you ruined everything. I bet this kind of behavior spills into other parts of your relationship, too. In my experienced opinion, it's better to be alone & do things with friends than be tied to someonewho treats you like this.", "NTA - you came up witu a suggestion, now it\u2019s his turn.", "NTA. He's being a pain in the ass, that's what's up. Sounds like you came up with ideas but he just can't consider anything he doesn't particularly like. People forget relationships need to be 50/50", "NTA- I'd say- dude- do you even know what indecisive means? I've picked several times and you reject all my picks.

How can you be indecisive when you give him several ideas, and he says no to them all?  Ask him, \"What do you want? Because every idea I gave, you shot down. That's not me being indecisive. That's you not liking what I suggested.\"", "NTA, he's gaslighting you. I'd think about whether he's done it other times. If he insists you make a decision, make reservations wherever you want to go, and tell him if he's not happy with your decision he can cancel the reservation you made and find somewhere else to go.

After he complained you were indecisive,  so you became very  decisive,  yet he ditched your choice, and your second choice... Damned right he's gaslighting you.\nHe's good at ditching your wants, ditch him.  Stay strong!

So the reason he is saying you are indecisive is because everything you put on the table, he does not want and you have to look at something else.

Are you actually indecisive or does he constantly makes you feel unsure of what you are choosing and yourself? Do you decide something but then question yourself after conversation with him? \n\nCause I know actual indecisive people because they are personally worried they will pick wrong and not choose the good thing they will actually like or have a FOMO moment. Then there are people that are indecisive because people around them question their judgment, choices and decisions. Then become extremely critical of them and when they are ready make the choice that makes them happy and making the \u201cindecisive\u201d person feel like shit. This can happen with people pleasers. \n\nAnywho fuck that guy start making decisions and if he doesn\u2019t like it decide to be with someone else."]}
