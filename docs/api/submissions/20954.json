If you don't stop all talk of my dad, I'm going to have to pump the breaks on our relationship becauae of your lack of respect of me and what keeps me in a good place.\"", "Wow I hadn't thought of this.", "A bit more context:   \n\n\nUntil a year ago he lived in another country and I'd only see him in the summer when he'd come home for a few months. last summer he moved home and told me his mother found an apartment--she lived in his house for the 10 years he was gone. i asked him where, and when he told me, I asked if there was underground parking because she can't walk up the concrete stairs in the winter. He responded with \"Me and my siblings know, but you can't tell your grandmother\". I was instantly confused and told him I'm not going to keep my safety concerns from my grandmother. He kept saying stuff like \"when you are tasked with finding her an apartment, you can tell her whatever you want\". and I just told him I was done with the conversation, and he wouldn't drop it. He kicked me out of the car because I wouldn't agree not to say anything to her. And then when I did get out, he acted shocked and convinced me to get back in. Then he just started again, and when I kept telling him to let me out and to stop the car he wouldn't. He did eventually stop, and then my grandmother came to pick me up. She already knew what was going on because he told her, and she was laughing a bit out of how silly he was being because she already knew about the stairs, and then she told me there is underground parking. For some reason when I asked if there was, he just completely ignored my question and started berating me.   \n\n\nWhen I saw him I told him \"If someone says a conversation is over, you have to drop it. if they tell you to stop the car and let them out, you have to stop\" and the only thing he said was \"you remember that\". Which I'm not sure why he said, because literally not once in my life has anyone repeatedly said \"this conversation is over\" to me. I've never been in that situation, not even with him.   \n\n\nAnd then I'm not sure how much later it was, maybe that night, or a few days later, i called him and it didn't go well. It ended with him calling me a teenager. And the I didn't talk to him for many months.   \n\n\nThe main thing that happened between us though, is that he was a prof at the university I went to. One day I saw him, and my pants were down a bit. He pointed at a random stranger and said \"why don't you go tell that guy you want him to \\_\\_\\_ you in the A\\_\\_\". Which is by far the most offensive and bigoted thing anyone has ever said to me. A few weeks ago when he tried to contact me out of the blue, my questions were about this thing that happened at his job and the school I went to. One of his responses was \"you are a child. grow up. it was a comment that you took badly, that wasn't my intention. When have you ever seen me try to shame anyone for their orientation or gender?\" and he went on in the same way. In the same email he said \"I was always there for you. I was always nice to you\".   \n\n\nIt's like he didn't understand the email he was responding to at all. I'll gladly accept that he isn't homophobic, but for some reason he won't accept that what he said was homophobic. He won't accept that what he said to me was not nice. etc. He said multiple times that it was a thing he read somewhere. I don't know what that means, but I take it to mean he read that when men have their underwear exposed it means they want gay sex. I really don't think he's homophobic, I just think he's a bit clueless.   \n\n\nBut, the main reason I go no contact with him is that he says these things to me, then wants things to just go back to normal. Only once in my entire life has he apologized to me and admitted he was wrong, and then the next summer when we started arguing he threw the last time in my face and made it out like it was my fault, even though he literally apologized.   \n\n\nFor me the things he's done that have upset me aren't that important, it's that when I try to set a boundary and tell him I'm not okay with what happened, he insults me. I'm just tired of being told to grow up and that I'm a child and that I have mental problems.", ">he didn\u2019t want to just drop you and leave you by the side of the road, which I don\u2019t really see as problematic tbh.\n\nYou got this wrong. It doesn't matter what he did or didn't want. He was essentially yelling at me, and when I kept saying the conversation was over he kept saying it wasn't. When I kept trying to get him to stop the car and let me out, he just kept berating me and telling me what I was and wasn't allowed to do. It was like it wasn't even registering to him I was telling him to stop and let me out, he was having a hissy fit because I was refusing to even entertain the conversation he was trying to have. The reason I was being like this is because from what other people have told me the best way to deal with him is to just cut the conversation off if he's not willing to actually talk about it. He was just being angry at me, essentially. \n\nYou don't think it's problematic to be told to stop the car and let someone out and then not do it? I'm an adult and if I don't want to be berated by my father, I think I have the right to demand to be let out of the car. I've put up with it for so many years, that I'm not doing it anymore. If he can't accept a conversation is over, then I'm removing myself from the situation. \n\n> He had already told his mother about the stairs and the underground parking\n\nI'm not sure where you got this from, but this isn't true. \n\n> It\u2019s childish to try to get out in the middle of nowhere just because you dislike the way a conversation went imo.\n\nIt wasn't the middle of nowhere. It was within walking distance of my apartment and his house. It wasn't just me disliking the way the conversation went, it was me not having any interest in the conversation and him not being able to take no for an answer. \n\nI don't think I should have to put up with him being angry and aggressive towards me, that's why I got out. I don't think I should have to listen to him berate me long after I say the conversation is over, that's why I got out. \n\n> The pants thing is more problematic of course, but to go no contact over a comment which you yourself admitted came from a place of cluelessness and not homophobia.\n\nThat's actually not why i went no contact. It's a small part of it. I went no contact because when I asked him why he thought it was appropriate to talk to me like that, he told me I'm a child and to grow up and that I have mental problems and that it was just a comment and I'm taking it badly and I need to grow up. I was also no contact with him before this as well, but I was trying to give him a chance. \n\nI don't care about the comment, I care that any time I express to him why I'm upset with something he's said or done, he insults me, he further berates me, he blame-shirts, etc\n\n>  but to throw away your entire relationship over the two incidents you have mentioned\n\nit's not two incidents. It's incident after incident after incident. I only gave the ones that are most recent. He was away for around 10 years, and every summer he was home things like this happened, and then we'd barely talk the rest of the year while he was away. \n\nThe issue from my perspective is that he has no respect for me, and when I've said things to him like \"I'm not okay with the way you talk to me and I'm not going to put up with it\" he responds with \"there is nothing wrong with the way I talk to you\".\n\nNothing I can say or do will get him to back off once he gets angry. If I tell him the conversation is over he starts telling me it isn't. I don't think it's childish to demand to be let out of the car if he won't back off when I say the conversation is over.\n\n> You\u2019ve said that he doesn\u2019t accept that what he said was not nice, but he literally said \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that to you.\u201d\n\nHe said \"you are a child. grow up. you have mental problems\" at the same time as he said he shouldn't have said it. Him admitting he shouldn't have said it at the exact same time as insulting me for expressing why I'm upset with him doesn't exactly make me feel better. Like, why can't he just say he shouldn't have said it and left out the bits about me being a child? and that I have mental problems. For some reason he knows he shouldn't have said it, but he also thinks I'm a child because I expressed why i'm upset with him and what would need to happen for us to have a relationship again. \n\nLiterally my only requirements for his response to that email was for him to not insult me. He couldn't do it, that's why I decided not to meet up with him like he wanted.", "Yea the comment he made to you was terrible and you have the right to go no contact.Seems like he can\u2019t take accountability for his actions when he\u2019s in the wrong.", "[removed]", "Tbh I think perhaps you should have left a lot more context for readers, though some were already willing for you to go no contact just from these two incidents. \n\nFor me it was dependent upon the relationship you guys had prior because two incidents is not enough in my opinion to go no contact, because people can act out of character. \n\nIf this is him in character and you just have tired of it, then by all means distance yourself.\n\nTruthfully I still vehemently disagree with your view of the side of the road incident, but it\u2019s based on opinion just like your view on it so it\u2019s not worth contending differences over as we cannot convince one another how to handle such a situation so I won\u2019t discuss that part further it would only be unproductive. \n\nI think including more context would be helpful in the future if the crutch of the problem is your fathers history of behaving in such a way, without the history, to me, it doesn\u2019t have the same pull. \n\nAnyways hope you find happiness and peace, with or without him. \n\nTake care", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

To me that\u2019s not appropriate passenger behavior. \n\nThe comparison between in a house, which is immobile and poses no risk of any sort, is rather disingenuous they aren\u2019t remotely the same idea. A house, sure, leave. A moving vehicle, is not the same\n\nYou also, of your own free volition got back in the car and then tried to get back out again, if you felt that strongly you should not have gotten back in, so it seems it was more you throwing a fit so he would shut up.\n\nYou say you know how your father is, yet continue on about how you would tell your grandmother anyways and cause more strife in the middle of a conversation, and then when he reacted, which you knew of course he would, you threw a fit and expected him to stop and let u out in the middle of nowhere.\n\nSometimes keeping something to yourself, isn\u2019t to give in to your father but to keep your own peace as he was the one driving. It would have served you in that moment to let that go, given what you know of your fathers behavior, and then do what you suggested you were going to as well.  It is to keep your peace, not to bend to him. \n\nSo while he is certainly wrong for his own behaviors. Some of his remarks about you behaving like a child, are not that far from the mark when you consider that you are a 34 year old man."]}
