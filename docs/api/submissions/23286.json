She asked me to just keep it between us  (she did not want her ex-husband or other kids to know).  8 months later when we actually called off the wedding, I had forgotten about these items as I had stored them in my childhood bedroom for safekeeping, and in the midst of moving across the country, I left the items behind which I am aware was careless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now and I recently learned that Anthony is engaged to Beth (30s) and my first thought was that I am really happy for them and wish them all the best.

I realize that you were trying to get to gift to your fianc\u00e9 in accordance with his late mother\u2019s wishes but that kind of went out the window when you and your ex called off the wedding.

At least you remembered about it. I don\u2019t know why his fianc\u00e9 reacted like that. It wasn\u2019t malicious. You had good intentions even though as they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I truly believe you did it with good intent. She reacted badly for a bizarre reason.
