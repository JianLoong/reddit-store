It was not specific to our wedding day but since she knew she would not be there she decided I should be the one to do it. She asked me to just keep it between us  (she did not want her ex-husband or other kids to know).  8 months later when we actually called off the wedding, I had forgotten about these items as I had stored them in my childhood bedroom for safekeeping, and in the midst of moving across the country, I left the items behind which I am aware was careless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now and I recently learned that Anthony is engaged to Beth (30s) and my first thought was that I am really happy for them and wish them all the best.  I then was thinking about our canceled wedding and his mom.

I then remembered Liz asking me not to share it with her other children or ex-husband and while I was unsure of the exact reason, I think it is because she had done the same for her other children but I am not sure who is holding on to their letters and gifts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI brought it up to my husband and explained how guilty I felt about still having these things and I just did not know what to do.

NTA and good fucking luck to his future wife.", "NTA - you were trying to fulfil his Mothers wishes. His fianc\u00e9 had the option of responding or not, you at least gave that option. It may have been a bit of a shock to receive the contact but if you accept that someone has a past you have to accept that sometimes that past may sometimes come into contact with your present.", "NTA. But i can see why you broke up, what a delightful guy..", "Based on what's been shared,  NTA. But it really depends on the details of the break up/post break up. If there was enough pain there,  may have been best to go through a third party.", "NTA and you seem lovely. I imagine you found a new guy immediately - much better than this ex", "NTA\n\nYou were doing your best to honour the wishes of his deceased mother. He's an AH if he thinks there is anything wrong with that, and so is she.", "NTA. But, you should maybe consider just giving them straight to Anthony. What if the letter says something about \"I'm so happy you're marrying Dense-Entrance, she's perfect for you\"?", "NTA. No good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA but you probably should have contacted your ex or even a friend of his instead of his fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t know you and because of that she has reason to believe that you\u2019re just trying to start drama. I realize that you were trying to get to gift to your fianc\u00e9 in accordance with his late mother\u2019s wishes but that kind of went out the window when you and your ex called off the wedding. You should have just sent him a message  informing him that you have a gift his mother gave you to give to him years ago that you forgot about and you\u2019ll be happy to mail it if he wants it.", "NTA.", "INFO: did you guys have a bad breakup? At least, would he say that you had a bad breakup? \n\nI can't really blame Beth. I think I would tell him as well because she doesn't know you and if you're being sincere or trying to cause drama.", "NTA, you were honoring her wishes, and if he can't see that then it's on him. You did the right thing and also it was thoughtful of you to carry her final wishes.", "NTA People are being too hard on you. Everyone involved is an adult and shouldn't be losing their mind because someone reached out to return some old sensitive belongings. Its not that big a deal.\n\nProbably should have just directly reached out to your ex though.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure it was not an easy time especially after ending an engagement. Especially one where you moved to the other side of the country and haven\u2019t spoken to him in 5 years. It clearly wasn\u2019t amicable. You were trying to do the right thing. At least you remembered about it. I don\u2019t know why his fianc\u00e9 reacted like that. It wasn\u2019t malicious. You had good intentions even though as they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I truly believe you did it with good intent. She reacted badly for a bizarre reason. I\u2019m guessing whatever he did to you he\u2019s done to her for her to react so bizarrely. NTA", "Hey man, you tried. NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut jeez must have been a bad ending between you guys for him to be pissed 5 whole years later after he has got a new fiance and everything.", "NTA but in retrospect if you have mutual friends that keep you updated, I would have gone with one of them. It was a nice gesture but you are a stranger to that woman and don\u2019t know what your ex has told her about you. Maybe if he doesn\u2019t want to retrieve the items, give them to a friend to gift him without you being involved", "NAH.You tried at this point send it to him or explain your reasoning and have some drop it off. Can appreciate you trying to keep his mom\u2019s word but at this point just hand the stuff over. She has every right to tell him you reached out, I would be weirded out as well. Your a complete stranger and his ex fianc\u00e9e as well. Good luck.", "NTA- I would.respond to the ex by saying, \"I will simply destroy the letter and gift from your mother since you feel I was out of bounds to contact Beth.  Goodbye.\" Then block him and destroy the letter and gift.", "YTA. You had a responsibility to give him this gift after the breakup. You forgot, that\u2019s fine, everyone makes mistakes. However going to his fiance puts her in a really awkward position. You\u2019re a stranger to her, you could be a crazy vindictive ex for all she knows. \n\nYou had to know she was going to tell him about all this, so why not just give the gift to him directly?", "YTA - you can\u2019t determine anything for another person\u2019s life after a breakup. You\u2019re acting on his mother\u2019s behalf but you don\u2019t know how his mom would have reacted to y\u2019all breaking up. You could have either sent the gift and letter anonymously or not sent it at all, but you determined by yourself that it was your place to involve yourself, and that\u2019s selfish. Bringing up his dead mom and talking behind his back to his fianc\u00e9 are pretty terrible things to do when you could have sent those items to him. Because if it were really important for you to deliver them because you want to honor his mom, you would have not forgotten about it until it was convenient to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have no idea what\u2019s inside it, but I figured she would want you to have it because I know her better than you. If you see my name or anything else personal, just cross it out and replace it with your name and such because I\u2019m sure your fianc\u00e9 and his mother think we\u2019re interchangeable. \n\nPs. Sorry ex for forgetting I had these very personal items. I quite simply forgot until I saw you were getting married to someone else years later.\u201d\n\nWhat part of that sounds charitable to Beth?
