She asked me to just keep it between us  (she did not want her ex-husband or other kids to know).  8 months later when we actually called off the wedding, I had forgotten about these items as I had stored them in my childhood bedroom for safekeeping, and in the midst of moving across the country, I left the items behind which I am aware was careless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now and I recently learned that Anthony is engaged to Beth (30s) and my first thought was that I am really happy for them and wish them all the best.

I realize that you were trying to get to gift to your fianc\u00e9 in accordance with his late mother\u2019s wishes but that kind of went out the window when you and your ex called off the wedding.

At least you remembered about it. I don\u2019t know why his fianc\u00e9 reacted like that. It wasn\u2019t malicious. You had good intentions even though as they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I truly believe you did it with good intent. She reacted badly for a bizarre reason.

You never got to meet your fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom like I did, and she gave me this very personal letter and gift. I have no idea what\u2019s inside it, but I figured she would want you to have it because I know her better than you. If you see my name or anything else personal, just cross it out and replace it with your name and such because I\u2019m sure your fianc\u00e9 and his mother think we\u2019re interchangeable.\n\nI know for sure that it was written when he was a child, she told me this much so I know for a fact my name was not in it.  Liz intended to give it to him on his wedding day but she knew she would not be there for it so she gave it to me.  I am not sure who she trusted her other children's items to but this was not a flex for me at all. Imagine if his 3 siblings receive these items in the future and he is the only one that doesn't because I decided I had a right to keep them from him. This was not about my feelings or Beth's feelings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Ps. Sorry ex for forgetting I had these very personal items. I quite simply forgot until I saw you were getting married to someone else years later.\u201d\n\nAs I have mentioned in a few comments, I moved 3 days after we called off the wedding, I have not been back to the house where my canceled wedding stuff is (my parents home) and I have been married to someone else for 3 years so, yes, I made a mistake in forgetting to return it at the time but I stull contend that my ex should not suffer because of my carelessness years ago.", "You could have told him all this instead of talking to his fianc\u00e9.

Or you could have even given them to his siblings who had or would have received similar gifts.\n\nI know I could have reached out to him or his siblings but not without spoiling his mom's plans.  She wanted him to have it on his wedding day from his wife. I was trying to honor her wishes.  I thought about all the possible scenarios and chose the one I thought most reflected what his mom would have wanted and also gave everyone a choice.  \n\nIf I told him, it ruins that moment between them, if I told a sibling, it steals their future moment, if I told his dad, I risked him not knowing about any of this and not following through, I thought about his mom's sister but I'm not sure what the status of that relationship is.  The only person I could think of that was in a position to not cause all that collateral damage is the person who is in my former position when the gift and letter were handed over."]}
