She asked me to just keep it between us  (she did not want her ex-husband or other kids to know).  8 months later when we actually called off the wedding, I had forgotten about these items as I had stored them in my childhood bedroom for safekeeping, and in the midst of moving across the country, I left the items behind which I am aware was careless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now and I recently learned that Anthony is engaged to Beth (30s) and my first thought was that I am really happy for them and wish them all the best.

I realize that you were trying to get to gift to your fianc\u00e9 in accordance with his late mother\u2019s wishes but that kind of went out the window when you and your ex called off the wedding.

At least you remembered about it. I don\u2019t know why his fianc\u00e9 reacted like that. It wasn\u2019t malicious. You had good intentions even though as they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I truly believe you did it with good intent. She reacted badly for a bizarre reason.

Maybe give the gift to a sibling of his.", "NAH - you had the right intentions, but I can also see why Beth might've been wary", "NTA\n\nI understand it is hard to get those items without ruining the surprise but his fiancee decided to blab to him about you.  Best to do is just fed ex them to him and give him a short note to explain why or how that happened.  That's about it.  You tried....you really did tried.", "NTA\n\nWhile moving some things in my parent\u2019s garage, I found some home video VHS tapes of my ex\u2019s father who passed away tragically when she was like 5. They were literally all she or her whole family had left of him (mom remarried and was the jealous type so everything else got thrown away). I knew she had me blocked, so I got on FB messenger and sent her mom (didn\u2019t answer), two brothers (also didn\u2019t answer), and her little sister (who biologically wasn\u2019t even related to the guy). My ex ended up texting me a few days later, absolutely blowing up at me that I should move on and leave her family alone. I told her why I was reaching out to them, and her response was \u201cI knew they were there, I left them there for safe keeping until I could get my own place! I don\u2019t have my own place yet, so just keep holding onto them!\u201d (At this point we\u2019d been broken up for over 2 years). I gave her the option of meeting halfway and giving them to her, or I\u2019d ship them to her mom (who I had found out was arrested and kicked out of her parents house, living with her new stellar fianc\u00e9 that none of them were too fond of). Needless to say, I met her halfway and that shit\u2019s off my conscience. \n\nWould I do it again? Absolutely. Not only do I NOT want the karma from a dead person on my hands, but that\u2019s someone\u2019s dying wish they trusted to you. You\u2019re responsible for giving them the option to take it, presenting it how you can. You tried the way that best fit his mother\u2019s hopes, and that didn\u2019t work out. I would at the very least mail it anonymously to him and leave it at that. He may be upset just because of who\u2019s delivering the message, which is blinding him from who it\u2019s actually from or what it is (like in my situation). Don\u2019t let him make a decision that will destroy something meant to be special and being his mother into his wedding, just because of his feelings for you.  \n\nGood luck navigating this, very few people know how hard this is on you, as well. I applaud you trying to act in maturity, feel free to reach out if you need suggestions or help.", "His future wife doesn't seem like such a nice person either considering she told him.

But it's been years since his mom passed away and you guys split up. After this much time has elapsed, your focus shouldn't have been on preserving the surprise anymore... you've both allegedly moved on, Liz is long passed, and you're in possession of gifts that were ultimately intended to be passed from a mother to her child.

I honestly wanted to mail it to her, give it to her, give it to him, give it to a friend, whatever she was comfortable with.  I mean no matter how I attempted to go about this, it causes drama.  If I reach out to him, that's disrespectful because he is engaged, if I call a mutual friend, I am pulling them into this, if I contact his sibling/family member, drama.
