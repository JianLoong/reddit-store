She asked me to just keep it between us  (she did not want her ex-husband or other kids to know).  8 months later when we actually called off the wedding, I had forgotten about these items as I had stored them in my childhood bedroom for safekeeping, and in the midst of moving across the country, I left the items behind which I am aware was careless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now and I recently learned that Anthony is engaged to Beth (30s) and my first thought was that I am really happy for them and wish them all the best.

I realize that you were trying to get to gift to your fianc\u00e9 in accordance with his late mother\u2019s wishes but that kind of went out the window when you and your ex called off the wedding.

At least you remembered about it. I don\u2019t know why his fianc\u00e9 reacted like that. It wasn\u2019t malicious. You had good intentions even though as they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I truly believe you did it with good intent. She reacted badly for a bizarre reason.

They were literally all she or her whole family had left of him (mom remarried and was the jealous type so everything else got thrown away). I knew she had me blocked, so I got on FB messenger and sent her mom (didn\u2019t answer), two brothers (also didn\u2019t answer), and her little sister (who biologically wasn\u2019t even related to the guy). My ex ended up texting me a few days later, absolutely blowing up at me that I should move on and leave her family alone. I told her why I was reaching out to them, and her response was \u201cI knew they were there, I left them there for safe keeping until I could get my own place! I don\u2019t have my own place yet, so just keep holding onto them!\u201d (At this point we\u2019d been broken up for over 2 years).

I would at the very least mail it anonymously to him and leave it at that. He may be upset just because of who\u2019s delivering the message, which is blinding him from who it\u2019s actually from or what it is (like in my situation). Don\u2019t let him make a decision that will destroy something meant to be special and being his mother into his wedding, just because of his feelings for you.  \n\nGood luck navigating this, very few people know how hard this is on you, as well.

Also, this note and gift\u2026.it\u2019s probably going to be about YOU and your ex, you\u2019ll at least be mentioned in the letter.

And you\u2019re surprised that he in fact views this as inappropriate?\n\nThis really smells fishy to me. Deciding his mother would care more about it being a wedding night surprise for him than about the fact that it\u2019s a completely different wedding and you disregarded her wishes for five years is a STRETCH. It\u2019s possible that you\u2019re extremely naive and thought you were clearly doing right, but it\u2019d have to be really naive to not think for a moment about the appearances. \n\nIt\u2019s also questionable that he apparently views his mothers death as THE major factor in your breakup, but it didn\u2019t occur to you that bringing up her final wishes would go badly. Quite likely from his perspective, you didn\u2019t care about his mothers death when it happened, but now you feel entitled to act on her behalf?
