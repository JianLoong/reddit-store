You have guaranteed that your youngest will never get a pet when they are older at least.", "YTA", "That\u2019s a crappy Christmas present that you pretended was for the kids, but it\u2019s really for you. YTA", "Choosing a dog without the input of your children was a dumbshit thing to do. Just for that, YTA. \n\nDogs have personalities, and it sounds like you and your partner picked one out and sprung it on the kids. And then you discovered that all dogs are not interchangable and there is a good reason why most people don't want pets being adopted on a whim. Or for christmas.\n\nAs a first time dog owner, choosing a big dog with a lot of energy was... an interesting choice. Not judging, because I would also get a rottweiler (or mix) given the opportunity, but I am curious if you amd your wife did any research on the breeds before deciding to adopt.\n\nThere is a right and wrong way to go about things and you have so far been muddling through with the absolute worst possible choices.\n\n1) Choosing a pet should involve the whole family, even if the choice (to get a dog) is one not everyone is enthusiastic about. And whether the adoption is done by a rescue or via a breeder, every member of the family should have met with the dog, and agreed that this particular dog is the one they wanted.\n\n2) springing this on the kids was a bad choice. They are not the ones who had wanted a dog, you were. They had not indicated they wanted a pet, or specifically a dog, so framing this decision as getting \"the kids\" a dog is unfair. You got yourself a dog, and lied to your children about it being \"for them\" so you could feel better about your decision. Not cool.\n\n3) Dogs aren't for christmas. You did this puppy a huge disservice by introducing it on a day full of excitement and not part of the regular routine. You planned this more as a \"surprise\" for the kids and not as \"bringing home a new family member\". The dog's first introduction to your daughter happened when everyone was hyped up and excited and the puppy reacted with puppyish enthusiasm, it is almost certain that the puppy behaved poorly during a christmas introduction, which may have poisoned the well of your daughter's regard. And it is likely that the puppy was chewing on her new toys, the ones she got for christmas, the ones your daughter actually wanted and asked for.\n\n4) trying to force your daughter to be involved in the dog's care is unreasonable. She does not like the dog, she does not want to interact with it. Why is it important that you force this issue?\n\nLook, getting rid of a dog because you are inconvenienced would be a dick move. But that is not the issue here. The issue is that your daughter isn't ambivalent or uninterested, she is actively repulsed, scared, and those feelings will not just disappear. The puppy is going to need a lot of care, training, and guidance. It is going to grow big,  really quickly. I think getting a puppy was a mistake, as an older dog is much easier to handle as a first time owner. \n\nI think you should either seriously consider rehoming the dog, and perhaps discuss trying again (with a hypoallergenic breed, for your other kid) with a better method of selecting a dog for your family. But at the same time, you have had time to become attached. If you do decide to keep the dog, you need to dogproof your home and put some protections in place to prevent your daughter having to deal with it, and also you need to talk to her about this situation and apologise for not taking her concerns and comfort into account when making this decision. If I were determined to keep a dog that I knew my child didn't like, I would probably ask whether she wanted a pet of her own, like a hamster or bunny, something that could stay in her room and which would be kept separate from the dog. It may not be what she wants, some kids don't like animals at all. But it is also the only thing I can think of that might mitigate some of the damage here. \n\nAnd don't give her dog-related chores. There are three dog-enthusiasts in your home, and plenty of chores that need doing.
