Just for that, YTA. \n\nDogs have personalities, and it sounds like you and your partner picked one out and sprung it on the kids. And then you discovered that all dogs are not interchangable and there is a good reason why most people don't want pets being adopted on a whim. Or for christmas.\n\nAs a first time dog owner, choosing a big dog with a lot of energy was... an interesting choice. Not judging, because I would also get a rottweiler (or mix) given the opportunity, but I am curious if you amd your wife did any research on the breeds before deciding to adopt.\n\nThere is a right and wrong way to go about things and you have so far been muddling through with the absolute worst possible choices.\n\n1) Choosing a pet should involve the whole family, even if the choice (to get a dog) is one not everyone is enthusiastic about. And whether the adoption is done by a rescue or via a breeder, every member of the family should have met with the dog, and agreed that this particular dog is the one they wanted.\n\n2) springing this on the kids was a bad choice. They are not the ones who had wanted a dog, you were. They had not indicated they wanted a pet, or specifically a dog, so framing this decision as getting \"the kids\" a dog is unfair. You got yourself a dog, and lied to your children about it being \"for them\" so you could feel better about your decision. Not cool.\n\n3) Dogs aren't for christmas. You did this puppy a huge disservice by introducing it on a day full of excitement and not part of the regular routine. You planned this more as a \"surprise\" for the kids and not as \"bringing home a new family member\". The dog's first introduction to your daughter happened when everyone was hyped up and excited and the puppy reacted with puppyish enthusiasm, it is almost certain that the puppy behaved poorly during a christmas introduction, which may have poisoned the well of your daughter's regard. And it is likely that the puppy was chewing on her new toys, the ones she got for christmas, the ones your daughter actually wanted and asked for.\n\n4) trying to force your daughter to be involved in the dog's care is unreasonable. She does not like the dog, she does not want to interact with it. Why is it important that you force this issue?\n\nLook, getting rid of a dog because you are inconvenienced would be a dick move. But that is not the issue here. The issue is that your daughter isn't ambivalent or uninterested, she is actively repulsed, scared, and those feelings will not just disappear. The puppy is going to need a lot of care, training, and guidance. It is going to grow big,  really quickly. I think getting a puppy was a mistake, as an older dog is much easier to handle as a first time owner. \n\nI think you should either seriously consider rehoming the dog, and perhaps discuss trying again (with a hypoallergenic breed, for your other kid) with a better method of selecting a dog for your family. But at the same time, you have had time to become attached. If you do decide to keep the dog, you need to dogproof your home and put some protections in place to prevent your daughter having to deal with it, and also you need to talk to her about this situation and apologise for not taking her concerns and comfort into account when making this decision. If I were determined to keep a dog that I knew my child didn't like, I would probably ask whether she wanted a pet of her own, like a hamster or bunny, something that could stay in her room and which would be kept separate from the dog. It may not be what she wants, some kids don't like animals at all. But it is also the only thing I can think of that might mitigate some of the damage here. \n\nAnd don't give her dog-related chores. There are three dog-enthusiasts in your home, and plenty of chores that need doing.

I got over my fear, and I grew to like him.  This change happened very very slowly over time, I\u2019m talking years of time.  Don\u2019t force your daughter to care for the dog and give her space, don\u2019t belittle her feelings.  Also, train the dog!", "YTA. Step it up and take care of your own dog.\n\nYour daughter didn't want it and still doesn't.

If you don't have time or you don't feel like it you can pay a dog walker. \n\nCrate train them and crate them when you aren't watching them. Use baby gates to keep them out of off limit areas like where the kids toys are being kept. Mistakes happen, but your dog shouldn't have ever been given the opportunity to destroy belonging that just builds bad habits.\n\nTake some time to actually train it to stop a barking and being loud and if you can't do that on your own, pay a trainer. \n\nYour daughter is not there to be a \"dog parent\" she's just a kid. You're there to be a parent parent. Act like it. Take a bit of responsibility for your poor decisions.", "YTA\n\nYikes, it sounds like you got the dog *you* always wanted, you didn\u2019t get your kids a dog. \n\nHas this dog had any training?

If your daughter recoils away from the dog maybe she is scared of it/has a phobia of dogs. If this is the case, you probably shouldn\u2019t take care of the dog anymore, or have it so that she would never have to come in contact with it, either by keeping it in a separate room while she is in the house or in some other way. \n\nIf the reason why the dog not going away is not an option because you think her opinions aren\u2019t as important as the rest of the family\u2019s, then you should rethink that choice because she is only 8, and while you might think it\u2019s not a big deal, it clearly is for her..\n\nEdit: YOU SHOULD REALLY PUT THAT YOUR DAUGHTER IS ALLERGIC TO THE DOG IN YOUR OG STORY- if your daughter is allergic to dogs and is very clearly suffering, why are you even having a dog?", "YTA for raising a daughter than doesn't like dogs. haha", "YTA\n\nA dog is a family pet, yes.

Dogs don't just grow out of that behaviour when they turn a certain age.\n\nI suggest take your dog to obedience puppy classes, and then obedience training with positive reinforcement.

The dog should not be allowed to have free reign to destroy your house and your daughter's belongings.  I had that experience and I had to eventually  give my mother an ultimatum about her dog that practically destroyed my house and furniture.  Either train the dog and insure him (he was a big dog, too smart, and felt he ran the house being an intimidating bully) or he has to go because he was too much of a liability and someone was going to get hurt.  She had to get rid of him because she did not want to spend the money or take the time out to train him herself.  Everyone else walked him.  I am taking anxiety medication to this day because of that dog and other factors that had happened.  Yes, the puppy will grow into a dog and still destroy things if you don't take action now to stop it.  No, your daughter does not have to take the responsibility to walk him.  You always wanted a dog, YOU WALK  HIM!", "NTA", "YTA. You wanted a dog so you \u201cgifted\u201d it to your daughters, even though from her reaction I doubt at least the youngest one never mentioned wanting a dog. So it was just a present to you. And then you expect them to take care of and do chores for the dog that neither of them agreed to", "YTA. It's your dog, not hers. She has absolutely no responsibility for it. You should be proud of her for standing up for yourself - how about telling her that *when you apologise*?\n\nKeep the dog out of her stuff. Replace the things that can be replaced, and make sure she can securely shut the door of her room.", "YTA and you\u2019ll be in trouble in about a year. You will have a HUGE teenager puppy with a lot of strength who will think it\u2019s absolutely hilarious to scare a child. That\u2019s how big, energetic puppies are. They are not bad, they are dogs. \n\nIf your kid won\u2019t interact with puppy, puppy will probably not learn to respect her. It will take child\u2019s toys by force and keep chewing them. Again: that\u2019s how puppies are. What happens if child tries to fight back? They will be about the same size and only one of them have big teeth. \nThat\u2019s how you get \u201daggressive\u201d dogs. Dog will not know how to do better. \n\nShe needs to train it and feed it to learn how to command the puppy, but NEVER without an adult who knows what they\u2019re doing. Are you sure you can be that adult? \n\nYour kid and that puppy are already communicating. She\u2019s afraid because she has some sense in her head. She sees that this puppy is already walking all over her and her stuff. It will not get easier. Please stop acting like it\u2019s not your responsibility to make them understand each other if not like. That is not a task for a child.", "NTA - Chores teach kids basic responsibility and respect I don\u2019t meat but as a kid it didn\u2019t refuse to wash the stuff used to cook the meat on or take the rubbish out if there was meat trays ect in the rubbish. Same concept with the dog although the chores aren\u2019t outlined I wouldn\u2019t say feeding the dog is a crazy expectation. \n\nPlus there is so much research showing that kids with pets have stronger interpersonal skills. Your daughter might be a bit uncomfortable at the moment but this is your chance to work with her to over come this", "YTA. Ditch the pooch.", "If also not like it's hard to know when your kid is afraid of dogs.  My kid went through a dog phobia phase at about 3.  He's now at a stage where he's learned to trust particular dogs but still freezes up if a dog barks or jumps. The dog he actually trusts the most is my neighbor's big old newfie because the dog is slow and patient and lets my kid come to him.", "For me the banger is that the older kid seems to be allergic to the dog, but OP doesn't care about that either.", "NTA????   Really?  You\u2019re calling him out on his behavior but he\u2019s not TA?", "How does an 8 year old suck for being uncomfortable?", "Involving a child, in an age-appropriate way, in the care of a family pet, is completely normal. If parents dropped their kids\u2019 involvement in anything the kid was even mildly opposed to, they wouldn\u2019t learn or develop correctly.", "**Please don't have the hypocrisy to pretend you got that dog for anyone else but yourself.** \n\nYour 8 year old doesn't want a dog and your 14 year old is allergic. That should be enough to re home the dog. \n\nYou are a selfish b\\*sterd and a hypocrite, YTA!", "You got a large dog notoriously hyperactive and destructive breeds crossed together and one daughter is allergic , the other wants nothing to do with it. \n\nIf you do want to have a dog your best option is to return the current dog to its breeder ( a reputable breeder will always take a dog back ) and all of you pick a hypoallergenic breed together that is smaller in stature and less of a handful, maybe an older less active dog to start. However as this is obviously yours and your wife\u2019s dog all the chores such as poo picking and baths etc should be squarely on yourself, not the kids.", "So you're forcing the dog on the kid who doesn't want a dog and the kid who's allergic to the dog... parent of the year...", "Your daughter shouldn't be asked to help out at all! She didn't want the dog and still doesn't want it. If you were living with a roommate and that roommate got a pet boa constrictor, and then told you not only are they going to let the thing roam free in the apartment but that they expect you to help them look after it and feed it and clean up after it, would you be happy about that situation? Because that is exactly what you are doing to your poor daughter. Frankly, I find keeping the dog KNOWING your daughter is afraid of it abusive. What kind of parent prioritizes their own desire to get a pet over their child's wellbeing?", "YTA \n\nTell me you know nothing about dogs without telling me you know nothing about dogs\u2026and kids apparently!", "What shitty parenting and bad dog ownership. The kid's didn't ask for this dog, why are you making them clean up after YOUR pet? Your kids are not extensions of yourself, they are not your servants there to clean up after your messes. This is YOUR dog that YOU wanted, no one else should be forced to do anything with it.", "I had to go back and re-read that. OP wanted a dog so they got their kids, at least one of which definitely does not want a dog, a dog for Christmas. And now they're complaining that the kid who didn\u2019t want a dog but got a dog anyway isn\u2019t doing the dog related chores OP forced on them. What on earth is wrong with you OP.\n\nYTA /u/Miserable_Park2349, very YTA. Dogs are an obligation, not a gift, and getting your kids a present because you wanted it is disgusting. This is homer\u2019s bowling ball, if not worse.", "Except if it\u2019s not a gift for the kids then OP can\u2019t have the dog while making them responsible for taking care of it.\nIf OP has to take care of the dog then that sounds like work for OP.\n\nWho is very much TA for that.", "This when we got a dog we talked about breeds, expectation, responsibility etc in advance it was somethingwe were all on board with but when we get any pet i get it under the assumption that I am the adult and ultimately it is my responsibility! \nDid this kid even want a dog? OP needs to make sure that the kids toys are safe, maybe put up some baby gates and make sure the kid has a safe space away from the dog!", "Also, the older kid seems to be allergic according to another comment.", "Yeah.\n \"My older daughter has been sniffly and sick almost since we got the dog and she's still happy to help out with him.\"", "Or even the allergy shots!!! Anything!!", "SMH yup, OP is TA", "Are you seriously suggesting they put their daughter on meds until the dog dies?? Dogs stick around for a while, and that'd be 10+ years of constant medication.", "Over the counter allergy meds often make people drowsy so you're suggesting that the eldest essentially be a zombie while she still lives at home?\n\nAllergy shots don't work for everyone either.\n\nShe is a minor and she may also want the dog it's the parents responsibility to put her health first over having a dog.", "And another of his children is allergic!", "\u201c10+ years of constant medication\u201d\n\nYou realize some medications are meant for and safe for long-term use? Allergy meds are one of them.\n\nParents should\u2019ve known if their kid was allergic to dogs before the dog came home, but this is a pretty treatable allergy, and this isn\u2019t even the kid who has issues with the dog. I loved my family dog and took meds because my allergy developed _after_ we\u2019d had him for years\u2014to the point that I now have an epipen in case of a severe exposure. \n\nBut even with an allergy that has the potential to get that bad, I can still manage it with meds. That\u2019s freedom, not being chained to medication."]}
