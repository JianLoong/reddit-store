You got a dog that YOU wanted and expect 3 other people to do most of the work, when 2 definitely had no input? Then, instead of getting a small, gentle breed like a Pomeranian, or a teacup Yorkie, you get a large dog mix that can be aggressive and chews up her things? Then you tell her, \"You take care of this monster that scares you.\" Shame on you.\n\nMy daughter would beg me for a cat or a dog, but my son is terrified of animals, with good reasons due to prior incidents. I ended up getting a parakeet, which we would sometimes take out of the cage. My son wanted nothing to do with it. One day it landed on his shoulder, my son took it and threw it on the floor. The parakeet was fine, but it was clear as day that my son would not get used to it and was scared of even this tiny bird. He is better now, but still doesn't care for pets. Don't force it.
