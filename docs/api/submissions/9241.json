Just for that, YTA. \n\nDogs have personalities, and it sounds like you and your partner picked one out and sprung it on the kids. And then you discovered that all dogs are not interchangable and there is a good reason why most people don't want pets being adopted on a whim. Or for christmas.\n\nAs a first time dog owner, choosing a big dog with a lot of energy was... an interesting choice. Not judging, because I would also get a rottweiler (or mix) given the opportunity, but I am curious if you amd your wife did any research on the breeds before deciding to adopt.\n\nThere is a right and wrong way to go about things and you have so far been muddling through with the absolute worst possible choices.\n\n1) Choosing a pet should involve the whole family, even if the choice (to get a dog) is one not everyone is enthusiastic about. And whether the adoption is done by a rescue or via a breeder, every member of the family should have met with the dog, and agreed that this particular dog is the one they wanted.\n\n2) springing this on the kids was a bad choice. They are not the ones who had wanted a dog, you were. They had not indicated they wanted a pet, or specifically a dog, so framing this decision as getting \"the kids\" a dog is unfair. You got yourself a dog, and lied to your children about it being \"for them\" so you could feel better about your decision. Not cool.\n\n3) Dogs aren't for christmas. You did this puppy a huge disservice by introducing it on a day full of excitement and not part of the regular routine. You planned this more as a \"surprise\" for the kids and not as \"bringing home a new family member\". The dog's first introduction to your daughter happened when everyone was hyped up and excited and the puppy reacted with puppyish enthusiasm, it is almost certain that the puppy behaved poorly during a christmas introduction, which may have poisoned the well of your daughter's regard. And it is likely that the puppy was chewing on her new toys, the ones she got for christmas, the ones your daughter actually wanted and asked for.\n\n4) trying to force your daughter to be involved in the dog's care is unreasonable. She does not like the dog, she does not want to interact with it. Why is it important that you force this issue?\n\nLook, getting rid of a dog because you are inconvenienced would be a dick move. But that is not the issue here. The issue is that your daughter isn't ambivalent or uninterested, she is actively repulsed, scared, and those feelings will not just disappear. The puppy is going to need a lot of care, training, and guidance. It is going to grow big,  really quickly. I think getting a puppy was a mistake, as an older dog is much easier to handle as a first time owner. \n\nI think you should either seriously consider rehoming the dog, and perhaps discuss trying again (with a hypoallergenic breed, for your other kid) with a better method of selecting a dog for your family. But at the same time, you have had time to become attached. If you do decide to keep the dog, you need to dogproof your home and put some protections in place to prevent your daughter having to deal with it, and also you need to talk to her about this situation and apologise for not taking her concerns and comfort into account when making this decision. If I were determined to keep a dog that I knew my child didn't like, I would probably ask whether she wanted a pet of her own, like a hamster or bunny, something that could stay in her room and which would be kept separate from the dog. It may not be what she wants, some kids don't like animals at all. But it is also the only thing I can think of that might mitigate some of the damage here. \n\nAnd don't give her dog-related chores. There are three dog-enthusiasts in your home, and plenty of chores that need doing.

I got over my fear, and I grew to like him.  This change happened very very slowly over time, I\u2019m talking years of time.  Don\u2019t force your daughter to care for the dog and give her space, don\u2019t belittle her feelings.  Also, train the dog!", "YTA. Step it up and take care of your own dog.\n\nYour daughter didn't want it and still doesn't.

If you don't have time or you don't feel like it you can pay a dog walker. \n\nCrate train them and crate them when you aren't watching them. Use baby gates to keep them out of off limit areas like where the kids toys are being kept. Mistakes happen, but your dog shouldn't have ever been given the opportunity to destroy belonging that just builds bad habits.\n\nTake some time to actually train it to stop a barking and being loud and if you can't do that on your own, pay a trainer. \n\nYour daughter is not there to be a \"dog parent\" she's just a kid.

If your daughter recoils away from the dog maybe she is scared of it/has a phobia of dogs. If this is the case, you probably shouldn\u2019t take care of the dog anymore, or have it so that she would never have to come in contact with it, either by keeping it in a separate room while she is in the house or in some other way. \n\nIf the reason why the dog not going away is not an option because you think her opinions aren\u2019t as important as the rest of the family\u2019s, then you should rethink that choice because she is only 8, and while you might think it\u2019s not a big deal, it clearly is for her..\n\nEdit: YOU SHOULD REALLY PUT THAT YOUR DAUGHTER IS ALLERGIC TO THE DOG IN YOUR OG STORY- if your daughter is allergic to dogs and is very clearly suffering, why are you even having a dog?", "YTA for raising a daughter than doesn't like dogs. haha", "YTA\n\nA dog is a family pet, yes.

Dogs don't just grow out of that behaviour when they turn a certain age.\n\nI suggest take your dog to obedience puppy classes, and then obedience training with positive reinforcement.

Picturing your toddler being such a good helper is so heartwarming!", "The \u201cdog parent\u201d thing would be stupid even if the kid liked the dog! At most a kid that age should be a \u201cdog big sister\u201d even if they are into it.", "YTA. One kid is allergic and the other hates the thing. You better have bought them real presents or this will be the Christmas they think about when they go no contact with you.", "Ima go with soft YTA this is my soloution she doesnt have to take care of the dog but shes not allowed to do special things with the dog this fixes the issue. as far as the dog chewing up her toys and her wanting the dog gone make her understand that life isnt fair and the dog is here to stay", "INFO: Did your younger daughter want a dog in the first place, or did you just disregard her wants?", "YTA.\n\nLook, I get wanting a dog, but if you get one, it it YOUR responsibility. Not your daughter's.\n\nMy husband and I are planning on getting a puppy in two years. But that will be OUR responsibility. Not our kids unless they want to be.", ">Growing up I always wanted a dog\n\n>We got the kids a dog for Christmas.\n\nThat ain't it. \n\nYOU wanted the dog. Do not get it for your kids as a Christmas gift. \n\nYTA", "The chores make it YTA, if you force her to take care of a pet that she didn\u2019t want.", "YTA. For one, why are you letting the dog chew her toys? Basic dog training says that if puppy is a chewer, then you swap the thing it CANT chew, for something it can chew. Id be pretty pissed if my stuff was getting trashed and its not going to warm her to the dog is it.  If the dog is too loud, that would suggest there is a barking problem, which can also be trained out of them too, so do better there. Why should she be expected to \"get used to it\". She is making it perfectly clear that she doesnt like the dog, doesnt want the dog etc. I suspect she can also see that you are putting the dog that YOU wanted, I mean I cant see anything in this post that suggests the kids wanted a dog, over her right to feel safe and comfortable in her own home. Given your comment about your elder daughter also been sick since the dog arrived, it would suggest that this breed REALLY isnt right for your house. You know have one sick and one unhappy child! Not sure you called this right", "YTA. It's obvious that you didn't get the kids a dog for Christmas, you got *you* a dog for Christmas. Plus, you're clearly ignoring the fact that your eldest is allergic to the dog.\n\nYour youngest is obviously scared of and annoyed with the dog. She shouldn't have to pet him or talk to him, and caring for him shouldn't be part of her chores, and you expecting her to is an AH move. She didn't ask for her, and she doesn't want it, so how about you take care of your pet? Or really, you should be considering getting rid of it because making your kids live with a pet that one is allergic to and the other is afraid of sounds like hell.", "YTA.\n\nSo just because you personally wanted a dog growing up doesn't mean everyone does. She isn't a dog person. She might \"get used to it\" but you can't force that option on her. Downplaying her reasons because you accept those as acceptable penalties of dog ownership and assuming everyone should accept them the same way is not okay and isn't going to get you anywhere. \n\nNow that you are in this situation you should not force the issue. She shouldn't have to care for the dog as part of the chores and if she doesn't want to pet him or talk to him she shouldn't have to and you should stop expecting it. She is your child, not the dog. You should apologize and stop acting like the dog is more important than she is. You are the adult who decided to bring the dog into the family, it's your responsibility to care for him. She isn't going to suddenly like him after being forced to care for him, she's going to resent him and you. \n\nKeep the dog but create some boundaries so she can decide how close or far she wants to be. Gate off the bedroom areas, especially while he's a puppy so he doesn't destroy personal items. Give him some crate time during dinner and other times when she is out with the family so he's not all over the place. You and anyone who wants the dog be the caregivers and give your daughter the choice of whether to interact. I'm guessing that part of the resentment and anger over the dog is that she was forced into this and he's destroying her stuff and being forced to care for a dog she never wanted. Some of that anger is being shifted to the dog when it's really about you and your choices.", "Take \"caring for the dog\" off her chores list-- this is a living being, and if the kid isn't into doing the dog-chores, then you shouldn't be risking they might not-and-say-they-did or anything. And if the dog can't avoid chewing things right now, you need to tell your kids to keep their toys, when not in use, in xyz rooms that have the door closed when they're not present until you can trust the dog not to chew. And you need to train the dog to chew only on his own things, he will only \"not do it forever\" if you teach him not to. I also highly recommend crate-training your dog.\n\nYwnbta to not get rid of the dog because your daughter doesn't like him, but you should accept the dog is yours and not hers and let her have space from him, and if you don't train him correctly ywbta.", "YTA, you wanted a dog then you gifted your kids a puppy and expect them to take care of it. Did either of them ever want a dog? Did you get a dog either of tjem said they'd like or is it just 'i get the dog, you get the chores' type situation? I doesnt even look like your older daughter wanted the dog, she just doesn't mind taking it on her runs. Sounds like you dumped a huge responsibility onto your kids so yeah, YTA.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nIn England, all of the dog shelters refuse to re-home dogs around Christmas time because of people like you and your wife... \n\nA DOG IS LIFE, NOT JUST FOR CHRISTMAS!\n\nYour daughter clearly doesn't want to be involved with the dog, and that's okay. Hell, she may even resent the dog a little because it may have eaten some of her toys, and that is okay too.\n\nTrain the dog like responsible dog owners and she may grow to like the dog as it calms down and gets older.", "I'm not saying your shouldn't keep the dog. However, if the child never wanted it, then you should not make her take care of it. I also recommend getting a baby gate for her room. That way she won't have to worry about the puppy coming in and chewing on her stuff.", "YTA for making your daughter care for an animal she doesn\u2019t want!! She didn\u2019t ask for the dog.
