Most places won't hand a script to just anyone, usually it has to be the person that it's for.", "It doesn't even matter that it was birth control specifically or that he's in a relationship with her. This is something I'd do at the drop of a hat for a roommate or friend, even a coworker. Refusing to do this for a partner shows such a blatant disregard for the people in your life.", "And he has to move his lazy ass body even less", "I just imagined her literally picking him up and putting him in a rubbish bin and setting it out for the garbage man.", "Umm... Not much anymore. We went hiking once and a few times to the cinrma, but as he doesnt work he doesnt have a lot of money nor does he want to ask his parents.

Applying for jobs is stressful I admit but stopping it for an hour because a person you claim to love asks you to do something for you is not that inconvenient. I'm sad for whoever you are/will be because it sounds like they can't rely on you.

Got tired of that quickly and noped out", "I'm in my late thirties and I don't have a license.  I'm also working full time and in school full time with a 3.95 GPA.

The problem is that fact that OPs bf expects OP to drive him around because he has a car. \n\nIt's the rest of the issues that's the problem, like you said he still hasn't found a job despite plenty of places hiring, he's lazy, unhelpful and wasn't willing to take a 15min bus ride to pick up medication for OP that benifts the both of them while expecting OP to chauffeur him around everywhere in her car.", "It's the same in the UK, as long as you have the person's name, post code etc then someone can pick up your prescription for you.", "Sounds like Mr Wolf's Pancakes.

I'm pretty sure that he enjoys the sex too, without the responsibilities of a baby. So it's not even a favor too, nor only her responsibility.
