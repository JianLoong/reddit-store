My dad's side of the family were forced to assimilate upon migrating which led to them losing their connection to their culture but my dad made sure that we kept up with Mongolian/Kazakh issues and culture.\n\nI have a classmate Jordan who's usually a very nice girl, but she's like a huge internet social justice warrior stereotype. We had heritage day on Thursday which is essentially where you show a family tree and explain your family history to the class.

Anyways I briefly mentioned that and then moved on to my mom's side of the family where I explained who the Y\u00f6r\u00fck people were and stuff.\n\nAfter my presentation, Jordan told me that I shouldn't have lied about my family's enslavement since \"only Black people were enslaved\" and claimed that I was Sinophobic. She then went on to say that white people have never faced oppression in history and it was \"low-key racist\" of me to use my \"25% Asian heritage\" to paint China as the enemy.\n\nI told her that it was just history and I wasn't painting China as the enemy and to educate herself on history. I said she was the one being low-key racist by invalidating my family's experience simply because I look white.\n\nShe then said that while there might be \"some\" Asian in my family, it doesn't matter because I look white therefore, the amount of Asian in me is insignificant and I shouldn't refer to myself as Asian because I don't face \"Asian problems\".\n\nI called her a racist and reported her to my teacher which caused a huge intervention in class on Friday. Jordan was called to the principal's office suspended for a week with this incident being put on her permanent record.\n\nJordan's mother reached out to mine and she was furious. She said that I ruined her daughter's future over a small disagreement I don't regret going to the teacher but I do feel bad that this was put in her permanent record cuz apparently universities are notified by things like this and as far as I know, this was her first time acting like this so it seems a bit extreme to me.\n\nAITA for causing this to escalate?\n\nEDIT: Jordan's mother didn't contact me she contacted my mom, sorry for the confusion.

Lol. She could end up in big trouble some day. The last thing the world needs is more racists.

They are the real racists.\n\nEdit - spelling", "NTA\n\nAnd she isn\u2019t a social justice warrior. She\u2019s racist. She made negative assumptions about you based on your race.  That is the definition of racism.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if this is the first time for her. She made a choice to do it. And hopefully she learns from this. She can educate herself and grow as a person. That could look good to a college.\n\nBut that all is certainly up to her and not on you. Really, if she was ignorant about the subject - truthfully, I never knew about this either and a quick Google history didn\u2019t reveal much - she could have spent some time looking it up.\n\nAnd she is VERY wrong on only black people were slaves- Native Mexicans, indigenous peoples of all kinds, Asians, whites, etc have all been enslaved or worse because of their race or who they were. The Romans took other \u2018white people\u2019 as slaves, too. \n\nHopefully, she come back with a new realization. But hon, that is up to her. It\u2019s like saying I don\u2019t look Romani, my other sisters look it. Yet we had family that fled before the Holocaust ramped up, but only Jewish people died right? And I don\u2019t even look Romani - there\u2019s more Irish in my family, my mom\u2019s dad was Romani- so I couldn\u2019t suffer like they did, so I must be antisemitic.\n\n\nJordan needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\n\"Only black people were enslaved\" lmao, this girl's an idiot and a racist one at that.\n\nTalk about r/USdefaultism", "NTA. Her comments were racist. The fact that she dismissed your heritage is racist. It's good that you stood up for yourself and reported the issue. \n\nIf she had simply apologised and gotten better informed nothing would've happened. The consequences of her actions are on her. \n\nNot to mention that if this was her first offense, and there was an actual conversation with the principal I have to wonder how she behaved in that conversation. If she'd shown remorse they probably wouldn't have suspended her. That's usually not an action schools take lightly.

It's not okay and only prove to show they didn't learn their lesson. No doubt she will be in even worse trouble after that.", "NTA. She and her mother sound exhausting! She was using her extremist social justice beliefs as an excuse to over inflate her narcissistic sense of self importance. The extremist ideology she ascribes to is toxic and runs counter to historical realities.\n\nYou tried to educate her and she doubled down, this is a FAFO.

The Slavic people, to this day, are a white ethnicity.\n\nIf you get any more nonsense, point them in the direction of Dianne Abbott, she did the same thing and the backlash from her job was ferocious since there were some anti-Semitic statements in it too.
