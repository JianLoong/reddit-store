However, I did make it clear to him that his proposal could have been planned out better. Of course, he got upset and began to say that \u201cmaybe the next guy will get it right\u201d.\n\nTo give some backstory, my now fianc\u00e9 and I have had some issues pertaining his family. Often, his family would make comments at my expense usually about my weight and how I cannot speak Spanish fluently even though I am also Hispanic. He has since apologized for them, but has never really said anything to his family about how they hurt my feelings. I have tried to get over it because I do love my fianc\u00e9 and it should be about our relationship more than theirs..right?\n\nAnyways, my fianc\u00e9 decided to propose to me in the house that is being built for us that we are buying together. He invited his family to be there as well as mine. On the morning of the proposal I was dressed in sweatpants, a simple tee shirt , and with no makeup since we were planning on just seeing the progress of our house. Also, my sinuses were really bad and I could barely breath out of my nose so I felt horrible. My fianc\u00e9 was aware of this.\n\nWe made it to the house and he had rose petals on the floor and I looked around and only saw his family behind us. I looked at him and he was already on one knee asking me to marry him. I felt like everything was happening so fast and we did not even get to have one second alone together because his parents were coming out from the hallway. However, I did say yes because I do love my fianc\u00e9 very much. A little later, I saw some of my family come out as well and they were happy and wanted to take pictures.\n\nAt this point I still felt horrible and I felt that I looked horrible as well. It was not how I imagined my proposal would go. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I talked about what I would like  to happen at the proposal, prior. I told him it was ok to have our families there IF we could have a nice moment together. I also told him that he had to make sure I was dressed nice. Also, I would\u2019ve have thought that it was obvious that I needed to NOT be sick.\n\nWhen I explained this all to him he got very upset and explained that \u201che needed to get it done before we went on vacation\u201d and that he had already told his parents that we were doing it that day so he couldn\u2019t change it. This was very confusing to me. It felt like he cared more about his family\u2019s feelings more than mine and that this proposal happened to please his parent and not me. \n\nHe told me that if I wasn\u2019t happy with how things went, then what was he supposed to do..propose again? Of course, I said no and that I love him and want to marry him but I just felt like the actual proposal could\u2019ve have been better because ultimately I did not like it.\nAm I the Asshole in this situation?", "created_utc": 1687798833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jmska/aita_for_getting_upset_about_how_my_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 534, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or tell you to get all dolled up to go look at progress on a house?

Some probably say no, she sure does lol.

For better or worse, a proposal and marriage are some of the biggest moments in a woman's life, at least culturally for Americans. Girls fantasize about their wedding day and the proposal from young ages, it is meant to be a flashy, romantic, or otherwise special moment that fulfills a fantasy. It is viewed as a life accomplishment. It feels disrespectful to have this cultural context, knowledge of his fiance's wishes (to be dressed well, to be healthy and feeling her best) and to fumble the bag like this.

I don't think that's too much to ask.", "Had your husband asked you if you wanted a nice, \"big gesture\" type proposal, and you'd said yes (and had many conversations about this fact), but he'd then ended up ignoring what you'd said and doing it his way instead, wouldn't you have been upset?

Some people want a big gesture, some people don't. OP wanted that, told her boyfriend, and he ignored her. \n\nThe problem isn't the actual proposal. I think it's more about the fact that OP said she and her boyfriend talked about how she would like the proposal to go, and he ignored everything she said. If OP cared more about the \"picture perfect engagement\", she'd probably be demanding another one, or she wouldn't have said yes. To me, this looks like she's just upset that her boyfriend ignored her feelings and opinions and just did whatever he wanted to instead. Even if he \"couldn't change the day\" because of his family (prioritizing his family over his girlfriend's feelings, just like he apparently has been doing for so long), how hard would it have been to make something up to get OP to dress nice?

A happy and healthy 20 year marriage, for sure - it's clear as a day the proposal does not matter that much.\n\nBut when there are already some cracks and issues, those relatively, seemingly insignificant things become prickly thorns. Case in point, a five year relationship where OP already feels like her partner has let his family repeatedly mistreat her without interfering, then a proposal where OP feels her wants are being ignored because of his family becomes something that is difficult to shake off.", "What a selfish take to complain about a proposal because you didn\u2019t look good. Is it about the proposal or about social media pics?", "What is it he didn't listen to, exactly? Her dressing nicely for the occasion? That's the only argument in which you could make, and even then, that's not a valid argument to say she's reasonable in being upset. \n\nYou're arguing that because she didn't dress well enough for the proposal, she's justified in her actions here?", "This is a two wrongs don't make a right situation. Maybe he was wrong in his delivery and the proposal was underwhelming for the OP and her expectations but it didn't demand the OPs response because now the take away from the guy is \"don't even bother to try, she will nitpick etc. Nothing is good enough, etc.\" and he will behave accordingly. If she had handled it better, it could have been a positive yet a learning experience for the guy and something more of a net positive overall. Now it is just a bad memory for both of them that has the possibility of being fatally cancerous for their relationship.", "You claim he wasn't romantic or wasn't romantic enough, which is false. \n\nYou also claim he was thoughtless about what she wanted, which is untrue. As I highlighted, he did most of what she desired. \n\nHe showed adequate consideration for her needs. For you to argue otherwise is foolishness. \n\nHe proposed in their dream home, which most would argue is a romantic gesture. Not only this, but she didn't complain about the engagement ring. That shows he bought her the ring she desired. \n\nThe family was there, both his and hers; celebrating the couple\u2019s special moment with rose petals at her feet. \n\nI fail to see how he was putting her second to his family during the proposal.

At first, I laughed, because I agreed with him. Once I read the situation, it\u2019s very clear that the OP was not in a healthy state of mind for the proposal. And they already discussed how she wanted to do it and he completely ignored her wishes and chose a time that worked best for him and his family and didn\u2019t give a shit that she was:\n\n1.  Sick. \n2. Not dressed nice.\n3.  Unable to have a nice moment with her husband.\n\nAll things she said she wanted. \n\nBut apart from that; it\u2019s a red flag that he still has contact with his family when they make disparaging remarks about his wife.
