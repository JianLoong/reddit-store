However, I did make it clear to him that his proposal could have been planned out better. Of course, he got upset and began to say that \u201cmaybe the next guy will get it right\u201d.\n\nTo give some backstory, my now fianc\u00e9 and I have had some issues pertaining his family. Often, his family would make comments at my expense usually about my weight and how I cannot speak Spanish fluently even though I am also Hispanic. He has since apologized for them, but has never really said anything to his family about how they hurt my feelings. I have tried to get over it because I do love my fianc\u00e9 and it should be about our relationship more than theirs..right?\n\nAnyways, my fianc\u00e9 decided to propose to me in the house that is being built for us that we are buying together. He invited his family to be there as well as mine. On the morning of the proposal I was dressed in sweatpants, a simple tee shirt , and with no makeup since we were planning on just seeing the progress of our house. Also, my sinuses were really bad and I could barely breath out of my nose so I felt horrible. My fianc\u00e9 was aware of this.\n\nWe made it to the house and he had rose petals on the floor and I looked around and only saw his family behind us. I looked at him and he was already on one knee asking me to marry him. I felt like everything was happening so fast and we did not even get to have one second alone together because his parents were coming out from the hallway. However, I did say yes because I do love my fianc\u00e9 very much. A little later, I saw some of my family come out as well and they were happy and wanted to take pictures.\n\nAt this point I still felt horrible and I felt that I looked horrible as well. It was not how I imagined my proposal would go. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I talked about what I would like  to happen at the proposal, prior. I told him it was ok to have our families there IF we could have a nice moment together. I also told him that he had to make sure I was dressed nice. Also, I would\u2019ve have thought that it was obvious that I needed to NOT be sick.\n\nWhen I explained this all to him he got very upset and explained that \u201che needed to get it done before we went on vacation\u201d and that he had already told his parents that we were doing it that day so he couldn\u2019t change it. This was very confusing to me. It felt like he cared more about his family\u2019s feelings more than mine and that this proposal happened to please his parent and not me. \n\nHe told me that if I wasn\u2019t happy with how things went, then what was he supposed to do..propose again? Of course, I said no and that I love him and want to marry him but I just felt like the actual proposal could\u2019ve have been better because ultimately I did not like it.\nAm I the Asshole in this situation?", "created_utc": 1687798833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jmska/aita_for_getting_upset_about_how_my_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 3750, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For better or worse, a proposal and marriage are some of the biggest moments in a woman's life, at least culturally for Americans. Girls fantasize about their wedding day and the proposal from young ages, it is meant to be a flashy, romantic, or otherwise special moment that fulfills a fantasy. It is viewed as a life accomplishment. It feels disrespectful to have this cultural context, knowledge of his fiance's wishes (to be dressed well, to be healthy and feeling her best) and to fumble the bag like this. I would be extremely disappointed as well. It's like if someone graduated from university and you showed up to the ceremony in sweatpants.

I don't think that's too much to ask.", "Had your husband asked you if you wanted a nice, \"big gesture\" type proposal, and you'd said yes (and had many conversations about this fact), but he'd then ended up ignoring what you'd said and doing it his way instead, wouldn't you have been upset? I think it's sweet and funny the way you got proposed to, and it clearly works for you, but a proposal is (hopefully) a once in a lifetime experience. Some people want a big gesture, some people don't. OP wanted that, told her boyfriend, and he ignored her. \n\nThe problem isn't the actual proposal. I think it's more about the fact that OP said she and her boyfriend talked about how she would like the proposal to go, and he ignored everything she said. If OP cared more about the \"picture perfect engagement\", she'd probably be demanding another one, or she wouldn't have said yes. To me, this looks like she's just upset that her boyfriend ignored her feelings and opinions and just did whatever he wanted to instead. Even if he \"couldn't change the day\" because of his family (prioritizing his family over his girlfriend's feelings, just like he apparently has been doing for so long), how hard would it have been to make something up to get OP to dress nice?

At least she would have either dressed nicer or brought another set of clothes!\n\nHonestly, he could have just put a set of nice clothes in a gym bag in the trunk for the pictures afterwards.", "So... he wanted OP to be sick and for her to look bad?", "This shift was 100% necessary!", "Lol I don't get it, your guy had rose petals and set up an actual big surprise, and you didn't like it, this person tells you it was just in a parking lot by the highway and it's beautiful to you.. \n\nI do agree, the fact that he couldn't wait another second is romantic as hell and would make me feel amazing if someone said that to me!", "I think this might one of those instances where if everything else in the relationship is good and you're in a good place together, then a relatively insignifianct issue can be just that - insignificant. A happy and healthy 20 year marriage, for sure - it's clear as a day the proposal does not matter that much.\n\nBut when there are already some cracks and issues, those relatively, seemingly insignificant things become prickly thorns. Case in point, a five year relationship where OP already feels like her partner has let his family repeatedly mistreat her without interfering, then a proposal where OP feels her wants are being ignored because of his family becomes something that is difficult to shake off.", "What a selfish take to complain about a proposal because you didn\u2019t look good. Is it about the proposal or about social media pics?", "What is it he didn't listen to, exactly? Her dressing nicely for the occasion? That's the only argument in which you could make, and even then, that's not a valid argument to say she's reasonable in being upset. \n\nYou're arguing that because she didn't dress well enough for the proposal, she's justified in her actions here?", "This is a two wrongs don't make a right situation. Maybe he was wrong in his delivery and the proposal was underwhelming for the OP and her expectations but it didn't demand the OPs response because now the take away from the guy is \"don't even bother to try, she will nitpick etc. Nothing is good enough, etc.\" and he will behave accordingly. If she had handled it better, it could have been a positive yet a learning experience for the guy and something more of a net positive overall. Now it is just a bad memory for both of them that has the possibility of being fatally cancerous for their relationship.", "You claim he wasn't romantic or wasn't romantic enough, which is false. \n\nYou also claim he was thoughtless about what she wanted, which is untrue. As I highlighted, he did most of what she desired. \n\nHe showed adequate consideration for her needs. For you to argue otherwise is foolishness. \n\nHe proposed in their dream home, which most would argue is a romantic gesture. Not only this, but she didn't complain about the engagement ring. That shows he bought her the ring she desired. \n\nThe family was there, both his and hers; celebrating the couple\u2019s special moment with rose petals at her feet. \n\nI fail to see how he was putting her second to his family during the proposal. That makes little to no sense to me.", "This is the problem. Women dream about the wedding, not even thinking about the most important factor, the mate.  Marry your best friend, for Pete's sake.  This is why there is such a high divorce rate. Big waving red flags long before the I do's....People don't change because of marriage. It's so much easier to marry someone who you adore, warts and all.

At first, I laughed, because I agreed with him. Once I read the situation, it\u2019s very clear that the OP was not in a healthy state of mind for the proposal. And they already discussed how she wanted to do it and he completely ignored her wishes and chose a time that worked best for him and his family and didn\u2019t give a shit that she was:\n\n1.  Sick. \n2. Not dressed nice.\n3.  Unable to have a nice moment with her husband.\n\nAll things she said she wanted. \n\nBut apart from that; it\u2019s a red flag that he still has contact with his family when they make disparaging remarks about his wife.

Figure that out soon.", "NAH\n\nThis one hits a chord with me because I had this discussion with my wife before about people being not happy with the way a proposal not going down the way the wanted, but the planner still spent a lot of time setting something up. I realize it's a big moment and a lot of times people want to be looking their best. But also, they need to realize a proposal that is more than just impromptu has actual planning to it - a lot of times, scheduling, reservations, people, etc - all these things need to align and it's really hard to call off if something doesn't go as planned. It's also incredibly hard to have a proposal be a surprise but also try and make sure your significant other is 'proposal ready' without tipping them off. It sounds like in your case, he opted to surprise you so of course he couldn't ask you to get dressed up to check on the house or you would know something's up. (He could have asked someone to bring your makeup bag and a nice clothes for you to get dressed afterwards for pictures, but that is some NEXT LEVEL planning that not many people would think of).  I myself was sick when I proposed to my wife but I didn't call it off because just too many things had to be rescheduled/redone (undecorating and then redecorating the house again so she wouldn't know in between what was going on when she came over, scheduling another dinner, getting another flower arrangement since the original one would have wilted, come up with a reason to cancel our currently planned plans, etc). Sometimes A LOT of work goes into the proposal that is a HUGE pain/expensive/or sometimes impossible to undo and redo and I think people getting proposed just need to understand that. This is a moment that takes work and it is rather disheartening that after all that work, to know your significant other is not appreciative or didn't like it.\n\nI would also say that your feelings are valid and of course you want to look amazing for your proposal pictures and feel amazing when getting proposed to. Nobody wants to be sick during such a big occasion. But please try to also realize that your fiance sounds like he put some effort into this with the roses, the families getting together, etc. Could he have called it off when he found out you were sick? Sure, but then it sounds like you were going on vacation soon and he wanted to do this before then. Perhaps it's because he wanted to spend that time as an engaged couple instead of worrying about the proposal. Perhaps it's because afterwards, the house would be built further and the location he wanted to use wouldn't be quite right any more. Or maybe it was hard to get everyone there on a particular date. \n\nI do think the way both of you expressed yourselves could have been different. Instead of complaining afterwards about the proposal, perhaps you could have thanked him for setting it all up - mentioned how much you love him and how happy you are to be engaged to him. And then bring up since you were sick, how about going to a professional photographer later to get engagement photos? Maybe you could even stage the proposal again to have some nice pictures on the wall. His response of 'maybe the next guy will do it right' sounds like a low blow (unless he's typically sarcastic like this) and if he feels unappreciated, he could express himself better.", "Why do so many guys I know do that same thing?  \n\n\n\"You don't like me joking about something disgusting, fine i'll never joke with you again\" type of stuff, such emotional manipulation.

It's supposed to be one of the happiest moments of your life and you ruined it. Perhaps with vanity, perhaps with societal pressure of a perfect proposal.

Besides how the proposal went, what jumped out at me was that he has not addressed your feelings with his family. My ex did not stand up for me with some of his family members, and it is hurtful.

He didn't even buy the ring he bought the 14k band.\n\nAfter that, I had a s***** bridal shower, and a s***** baby shower. He really took \"surprise\" seriously. After the first time, I told him he should lie and say that he was taking me out to lunch or something.\n\nFor my bridal shower he told me we were going to Home Depot to buy paint and paint the living room. I was un-showered in paint-stained jeans and a baggy ripped t-shirt with a ponytail and no makeup. I wanted to leave, but all the people were nice and I didn't want to hurt their feelings.

If he had given me a list of things to consider for his comfort, it might have taken the romanticism right out of it.\n\nTo take a kind view to it, your partner didn\u2019t care about making it perfect.

This future marriage is already doomed. \n\nIt seems as if you\u2019ve already looked past some major red flags so this shouldn\u2019t have been a super surprising thing to you - *rose colored glasses* \n\n1) he lets his family disrespect you and hasn\u2019t ever told them to stop \n2) he doesn\u2019t take your wants and feelings into consideration \n3) he considered his family\u2019s feelings before yours when it came to this proposal \n4) he lacked every level of tactfulness when it came to this proposal. It was insanely inconsiderate and you would have to be so shitty at reading rooms to propose to someone while they not only don\u2019t feel physically their best to want to be seen but are sick\u2026.doesn\u2019t that also put both of your families at risk of getting sick too?? \n5) he makes rude comments like *maybe the next guy will get it right* that\u2019s insanely rude and hurtful. \n\nHe lacks consideration and meaningful thought.  \n\n\nIf my fianc\u00e9 did any of these things, I would have alarm bells ringing through my entire body.
