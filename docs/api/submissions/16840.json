What that apparently means at least the way they use it, is they prefer to not wear clothes if they don't have to. That means they're naked or almost most of the time they're at home. I say they because she got our dad into it after they married.\n\nThey don't have guests over very often, because according to her \"I have to get dressed to visit my friends to make them comfortable, I get to be comfortable in my own home\" which she maintains even when I come over. I tried few times to just ignore it, but I guess I'm prudish, because it was just too weird for me.\n\nSo I basically told my dad that if he wants to see me, he's gotta come over to my place. He thinks I'm bsing unreasonable, and says I need to stop overreacting. He's even got my sister calling me and asking why I don't want to visit any more (She's kinda getting in on the whole thing as well).

I'd be completely weirded out by this myself if I wasn't raised in a household like that. Why would I want to see my parent(s) nude?", "NTA: it's weird to me when people want to force their level of comfort on someone else.  Maybe he should just \"get over\" needing to be balls out all the time.  If he wants to see you he can put on some clothes.", "NTA. Being naked is not a default state in our society and you are 100% right not to want to see your father's penis, even casually. If he cannot respect that, that's on him.\n\nIt's like smoking in a room with a non-smoker but worse.", "NTA for choosing for YOU to be comfortable. Good grief. He can't be taken seriously when he says you are overreacting; I'm sure he gets dressed to go to the doctor or the store or like, anywhere else in the world outside his home.  The icky inference is that you aren't important enough to put clothes on for, so you rate right below the mailman.  Has he always been this narcissistic and 'my way or the highway'? I mean, it's disturbing to me that he's saying 'you can't visit with me unless I'm naked', but I have the feeling there's been other situations where he has dismissed your concerns. That said, let him know that your offer still stands-- you are glad to visit at a coffee shop or go out for a meal, but seeing them naked is a hard now.", "NTA\n\nWhile everyone has the right to live their life how they want, that doesn't mean they get to force it on others. If your stepmother and father want to be naturists in their own home, that's their decision. But they should also respect that not everyone is comfortable with it and should be willing to put on some clothes when they have guests over. It's perfectly reasonable for you to not want to visit their home while they are naked or almost naked. It's not an overreaction to have boundaries and expect them to be respected. You have offered a compromise by inviting your father to your place instead, so it's up to him to decide if he wants to maintain a relationship with you or not. Your sister is still a minor and may not fully understand the situation, but that doesn't mean you should give in to her or your father's pressure. Stand your ground and continue to communicate your boundaries clearly and respectfully.", "\"I'm not comfortable with casual nudity. I'm trying to be respectful since--of course--you are allowed to set the dress code for your home. The fact remains that your dress code makes your home too uncomfortable for me to visit. I'm not asking you to change, I'm not trying to pressure you to conform to the rules of the overall society, I'm just clearly establishing my own boundaries. I would still like to have a visit with you, but since we can't do that at your house without violating my boundaries, I am inviting you over to my house. Or we could meet at a public place to have a visit. But I'm not comfortable going to a place that has nudity, and I need you to respect that.\"\n\nNTA. It would have been N. A. H.

You have expressed that to them and they are essentially choosing being naked over seeing you... that's not just you being unreasonable, they are also refusing to do anything to accommodate you.  If they want you to come over, there's a pretty damn easy solution, they just need to put some clothes on for a couple of hours.  Or they can come visit you.", "NTA. (Close call with NAH)\nThey have the right to live the way they want, you have the right to be uncomfortable with them being naked, and it is very healthy that you are setting boundaries. Seeing them outside their home, with clothes on, seems like a reasonable compromise .", "NTA. You\u2019re respecting them wanting to be nude in their own home by not asking them to put clothes on in their home, so they need to respect the fact you don\u2019t want to be around them when they\u2019re naked and they need to go to your place. They can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA I would not want to see my parents like that ether your comfort is also important", "NAH. They're free to not wear clothes in their home and you're free to be uncomfortable with it and not visit. \n\nTBH, I wouldn't visit my mother and her partner either if they were naked and my sons wouldn't visit me if I was naked.", "NTA. If they want to visit they can come to your house where no one has to be uncomfortable.", "NAH. They get to choose how they dress at home, you get to choose not to visit. It wouldn't bother me any, but you tried it and were uncomfortable, so they'll have to decide if it's worth the effort of getting dressed to have you visiting.", "NTA.  Stand your ground.  It\u2019s ok for you to have boundaries in your relationships.  If this makes you uncomfortable you don\u2019t have to subject yourself to this.", "NTA, honestly, the nudist lifestyle isn't for everyone and they shouldn't impose that on guests or relatives. It may be their home, but it's important to make guests feel welcome and comfortable too. With that attitude, it's SUPER not surprising that they don't have guests over very often", "NTA. I had friends that were naturists. It took a awhile before I felt comfortable being in their home. But eventually it was no big deal. It\u2019s not like i was staring at their T&A all day. They weren\u2019t sitting in provocative poses or anything. \n\nBut I couldn\u2019t imagine ever feeling comfortable around a step parent and parent that were nude. That\u2019s just not right to me.", "NTA\n\nYou are respecting their preference to be undressed at home.
