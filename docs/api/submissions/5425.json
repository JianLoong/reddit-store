He seemed to find it hilarious, but it was pissing me off.\n\n\nWhen we got back home I told my friend that she should just bring everything in and I would help her.

He went on and on all morning. My husband and I were both apologetic and I really do feel bad.\n\n\nWhen they were leaving he said they wouldn\u2019t be back until we got security cameras and that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how\u201d we can \u201cstand\u201d living somewhere so \u201crisky\u201d and I just snapped.
