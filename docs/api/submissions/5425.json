I told them again to just bring everything in because I read that there were some vehicles broken into at the mall this past week and they told me it was fine.\n\n\nI convinced them to bring in a few of the bags from the backseat and they moved stuff out of the back window. I tried taking a few more bags inside, but they told me not to and then they laughed and told me I was \u201cparanoid\u201d because I live on a quiet street.\n \n\nLater my friend\u2019s husband told my husband about how I \u201cpestered\u201d them and made jokes all night about me needing a \u201cnight patrol\u201d whatever the fuck that means. He seemed to find it hilarious, but it was pissing me off.\n\n\nWhen we got back home I told my friend that she should just bring everything in and I would help her. She told me not to worry about it and then had the nerve to ask if I was \u201cokay\u201d because I seemed \u201cstressed\u201d.\n\n\nI woke up this morning to my friend\u2019s husband yelling for her. Their car was broken into and everything is gone. Luckily most of the stuff is replaceable, but his work laptop and phone were both taken.\n\n\nWhen he got off the phone with the police he ranted about us not having security cameras and that we should have told them what the \u201csituation\u201d was like in our neighbourhood. He went on and on all morning. My husband and I were both apologetic and I really do feel bad.\n\n\nWhen they were leaving he said they wouldn\u2019t be back until we got security cameras and that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how\u201d we can \u201cstand\u201d living somewhere so \u201crisky\u201d and I just snapped. I told him we don\u2019t need security cameras because we aren\u2019t dumb enough to leave shit in our cars overnight and that I told them to bring their stuff in and that they are lucky more stuff wasn\u2019t stolen because I made them bring it inside.\n\n\nHe seemed shocked and just got into the car while my friend hugged me goodbye. Earlier I texted my friend to ask if they made it home alright and that I feel awful that their car was broken into. She responded that they made it home and that \u201cthese things happen\u201d.

Your friends are dumb and entitled. They are the one who were dumb enough to leave important stuff in their car even though you insist it is not safe and even had to call you paranoid. And they have the guts and entitlement to tell you, you should've offered to pay?", "Right? I don\u2019t even leave my work computer in my car at work when I visit other job sites. I carry my backpack inside. I don\u2019t know anyone who leaves their work computer in the car. It can get you fired at many places.", "Exactly. People around here have cameras. They often post videos of their cars being broke into on Nextdoor. The crooks are seldom identifiable.\nDon't leave stuff in your car!", "Totally. Also, money to replace a work laptop? For someone else's work? C'mon.", "i think it's also worth keeping in mind that they were actively making fun of OP as well.\n\nNTA. what the hell? your friends are a whole circus. the fact they're playing the \"real friends\" card here makes it a million times worse.\n\ne: words", "Correct hes behind that last text too \n\nOnly last message and go no contact \u2018hmu solo when you come to your senses\u2019", "Totally!", "I don't even leave coins visible in the car.  desperate people will break the window to get the coins", "You forgot\nDudes wife: a true friend would replace the items we practically asked to be stolen", "OP should tell them they don't have cameras because they aren't \"paranoid\" lmao", "I\u2019m honestly wondering if Dude texted that from her phone.", "NTA,  this guy left a work computer in a car. \n\nSeriously who does that, cyber security negligence of the highest order. \n\nYou don't owe them a cent. You warned them enough of times", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t give them a cent. \n\nYou warned them. \n\nThey mocked you. \n\nYou can\u2019t help stupid. \n\nYou didn\u2019t say anything wrong, and you didn\u2019t even begin saying anything until he went off at YOU for what HE did.", "NTA they are trying to shift the blame to anyone but themselves. You told them the risk, they refused to listen. They aren\u2019t your friends, just a couple of assholes.", "A security camera is no replacement for a functioning brain and a pair of ears.\n\nWhy on earth you are devoting so much as a second of your time and energy on this pair of dimwits is beyond me. \n\nHow many times do you have to tell them not to leave stuff in a car a couple of days before Christmas? Even worse, they mocked you for your caution and then had the temerity to ask you to pay for stuff you tried to protect.\n\nIf this is typical of their general behaviour, I really hope they have a miserable Christmas. Idiots.\n\nNTA and enjoy your Christmas in the certain knowledge your idiot friends are having a miserable one", "NTA.   I\u2019d find new friends.   These two are immature jerks.", "NTA\n\nI normally say \"I told you so\" never helps so is never right.  In this car where they are claiming you didn't earn them,  when in fact you warned them multiple times - entirely justified\n\nTrue friends don't bail others out for their own stupidity.\n\nTrue friends, do take the warnings from their friends seriously and don't ridicule them.", "NTA, your friends and husband are though.  The audacity to think you should offer to pay for replacements after you expressed concern multiple times and offered to help carry pkgs in.", "NTA. I don't know what he thinks cameras would do. Having video won't help, they'll likely be unidentifiable and there's very little chance the police will care enough to do anything other than take a report and close it. People will break into your car for the change in your ashtray, I can't believe he'd leave a phone and computer in there on his own, much less after a warning!", "NTA", " 1- sometimes people make choices that make it seem like they want bad things to happen. Unless you have a medical reason or some sort of condition person should leave a laptop in a car no matter the neighborhood. \n\n2- no way on earth I would let them make **one** comment about how they weren\u2019t warned.  \n\n3- their car their risk. \n\n4- people like this make bad choices and then it\u2019s always someone\u2019s else\u2019s fault. Why would you even want that friendship.\n\n **NTA**", "Nta. Lol. I live in a very nice area, my car looks like it's.. well, from '95. It doesnt look like one thatd have anything valuable in it. It's still been broken into. Quiet streets are the perfect streets. People leave their cars unlocked and valuables are forgotten because, well, they can be replaced easily. \n\nPersonally, I never EVER leave my computer in my car. Anything over 20$ is in my hand or my bag. They're idiots for leaving anything expensive in their car. You warned them multiple times, if they cared that much about the presents they'd have brought them in.", "NTA, for sure!", "NTA - Whilst I can't understand people living in areas with high crime rates, you did everything you could to mitigate the circumstance and it really wasn't a big deal to bring everything inside. \n\nYou handled it well, they handled it poorly - likely because of the stress.", "NTA ..... these people are eej!t$ ! Can't believe the cheek of expecting you to replace their belongings !! Entitled much !!", "You told them to move their stuff twice and they're mad at you? NTA op. Maybe don't rub it in next time though, it was definitely unnecessary, if understandable", "It is INSANITY that they would expect you to reimburse them. I would literally cut them off and never speak to them again. You went above and beyond to inform them of the situation, and they threw it in your face and chose not to listen to you even though you literally offered to bring in the bags for them (they wouldn't even have to do any work to keep their belongings safe). Not only that, but when your warnings manifested, they decided to blame you and shame you (no security cameras) and guilt trip you for getting mad at their downright rude and ridiculous behaviour and ask you to PAY FOR THE STUFF YOU WARNED THEM TO KEEP SAFE **REPEATEDLY**. I cannot emphasise how crappy these people are. NTA", "NTA. \"Real friends would not put the blame on us for their mistakes, especially when they were advised against leaving things in their cars.\"", "NTA, you did tell them not to leave stuff in their car, but they proceeded to mock you. You snapped because he put the blame on you even though you gave plenty of warning, not because you felt the need to remind them you were right.", "NTA at all. 100% not your fault.\n\nOn the other hand, you may want to reconsider how \u201csafe\u201d your neighborhood is evaluated in your mind. Seems like you somewhat recognize the true nature of it.", "NTA\u2026 you told them again and again and again. They REFUSED to listen. Their car was broken into and their shit got stolen. They did it to themselves because they were too damn lazy to bring their stuff in. Then the dude wanted to blame you. You warned them again and again. Actions have consequences. He is suffering his own consequences brought on by his lack of actions. Not your fault.", "NTA NTA NTA!!! Your friends suck! Get new ones. They even had the audacity to mock you when you told them to bring their stuff in side...", "Damned if you do and damned if you don't. NTA", "NTA you warned them, several times and they chose to ignore you and mock you. Common sense says you don\u2019t leave valuables in your car - shoot every workplace has a training telling you NOT to leave your work phone/computer in your car\u2026 \n\nThese things can happen anywhere. Celebrities with eight and nine figure homes get their homes broken into. Not to mention, any news station in the USwill tell you crime is up exponentially, especially theft/car break ins.", "NTA Who leaves a phone and a laptop in a parked car? I live in the safest place possible but still know that\u2019s unwise. They have some nerve asking for money in any case but especially after mocking you for repeatedly giving them sound advice.", "Lol NTA. They both sound rude, lazy, and obtuse. Maybe they'll learn from this mistake that is entirely their own, but it doesn't sound like it.", " NTA, Replace their stuff??? This guy left his WORK laptop in a car overnight and thinks it's on You? After mocking your concern? Ridiculous.", "I can think of no reason a rational sane person would ever leave a laptop in a car unless they are trying to get it stolen from some kind of social science experiment.", "I know someone who got fired for laptop being stolen from his car.", "Even without the risk of it getting stolen, depending on what the weather is like where they, it\u2019s a stupid idea to leave the laptop in the car.

Replacing the laptop is cheap compared to the time that will be spent on the resulting cybersecurity incident.", "My friend was an external auditor and was at a client. She was in the room provided by the client and some guy walked in and said they needed the room for an hour to clean the carpet. She secured the laptop (attached the cable around something and locked it into the laptop) and went for an early lunch. She got back the cable was cut and laptop stolen. Her office said she was negligent and on the hook for the laptop. She countered the client let the guy into the office and how was she supposed to know he wasn't the carpet cleaner. Her office backed off after that.", "Thank you for summing it up. How incredibly unintelligent these entitled hanyacks are to think that op should replace the stuff they decided to leave in their car?

The OP should be glad they won't ever come back!", "Not to mention\u2026 how fucking unbelievably audacious to try and imply that OP lives in a criminal neighbourhood like it\u2019s a poor life decision. \n\nFirst, people who live in neighbourhoods with high crime rates generally can\u2019t afford not to. \n\nSecond, many affluent areas have car break-ins because criminals from OTHER neighbourhoods (sometimes even other cities entirely) travel to neighbourhoods where they\u2019re more likely to get a payoff (like where some morons think they\u2019re immune from bad fortune and leave a laptop and phone in the car).\n\nI\u2019d have stopped being apologetic or sympathetic the moment they began making fun of me the night before. Saying sorry in a situation where you\u2019re being unfairly blamed for something only fuels them because it validates to them that you believe you have done something wrong. I would have just been calm, deadpan. That\u2019s all that works when someone is being ridiculous. Show them how ridiculous they\u2019re being by not engaging. \n\n\u201cI refuse to take abuse because you feel embarrassed you didn\u2019t listen. Cameras won\u2019t do anything to prevent crime or get you your stuff back. If you\u2019re willing to stop yelling at me, or blaming me, and act like an adult who can take responsibility for the consequences of their own actions, I\u2019ll try and help you sort things out. Otherwise, like you said, you can feel free not to return in future.\u201d", "Thank you, I\u2019ve tried explaining this to people. Don\u2019t leave stuff in your car, reinforce entry points to your home. Cameras can get footage of thieves unlikely to be identified. Better to prevent than to work with footage after the fact.", "The only situation in which in would be appropriate for the friends to ask OP to reimburse their stolen items is if OP actively told them not to bring their things inside as they were attempting to do so or told them they were not allowed to do so. Even if OP didn't warn them about the circumstances, that still wouldn't be grounds for reimbursement as it's not her fault and anyone dumb enough to leave important work items in the car deserves what they get.", "Even worse. \n\nOP: don\u2019t leave stuff in the car. \n\nDude: _leaves stuff in car_\n\nOP: _warns dude several times not to leave stuff in car_\n\nDude: Haha, you\u2019re so paranoid.", "I had someone break into my car and steal a USB drive, worth like $8. They left a hand print and got identified.
