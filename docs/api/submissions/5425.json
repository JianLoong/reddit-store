He seemed to find it hilarious, but it was pissing me off.\n\n\nWhen we got back home I told my friend that she should just bring everything in and I would help her.

He went on and on all morning. My husband and I were both apologetic and I really do feel bad.\n\n\nWhen they were leaving he said they wouldn\u2019t be back until we got security cameras and that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how\u201d we can \u201cstand\u201d living somewhere so \u201crisky\u201d and I just snapped.

Unbelievable how careless people can be with things they didn't pay for.", "Same.", "One friend would leave her vehicle unlocked because in her former neighborhood vehicle break-ins happened a lot, her window was still smashed in to steal a Garfield plush attached to a back window, all thief had to do was open the door.", "I\u2019ll trade you my wallet back for a costco sized container of tums. That was my car break in penalty this year. It does shake your trust to have things stolen but you made off about as well as possible from the experience", "Lol love it when they leave shit behind. Moms car was broken into a while ago. They stole a few dollars of change but left their cigarettes which definitely cost more than what they took.", "It's -27 here, -33 with wind. Or uhhhh what is it in American... -17F, wind -27. I get worried carrying my phone around!", "I get worried opening a door at this point.  I live in the Southern US, I don't deal well with cold.", "Oh I absolutely did!! There were a lot of important and expensive things that could've been taken (we were in the middle of unloading the car for a visit with family at Christmas time). I'm honestly amazed that that was all they took and with all seriousness I know/knew how lucky I was and how much worse it could've been. At the moment I was less than amused since I just finished eating a very spicy dish and had horrendous heartburn (remember I was heavily pregnant and not thinking as rationally as normal). Thankfully my husband went and got more quickly and cleaned all the places we thought they may have touched since I was then also grossed out that a stranger touched our things. \n\nI'm very sorry to hear you had your wallet stolen that's terrible in general with how much work it is to replace anything(what you're even able to) but scary since the person then has your address and personal information."]}
