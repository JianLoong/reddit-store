I told them again to just bring everything in because I read that there were some vehicles broken into at the mall this past week and they told me it was fine.\n\n\nI convinced them to bring in a few of the bags from the backseat and they moved stuff out of the back window. I tried taking a few more bags inside, but they told me not to and then they laughed and told me I was \u201cparanoid\u201d because I live on a quiet street.\n \n\nLater my friend\u2019s husband told my husband about how I \u201cpestered\u201d them and made jokes all night about me needing a \u201cnight patrol\u201d whatever the fuck that means. He seemed to find it hilarious, but it was pissing me off.\n\n\nWhen we got back home I told my friend that she should just bring everything in and I would help her. She told me not to worry about it and then had the nerve to ask if I was \u201cokay\u201d because I seemed \u201cstressed\u201d.\n\n\nI woke up this morning to my friend\u2019s husband yelling for her. Their car was broken into and everything is gone. Luckily most of the stuff is replaceable, but his work laptop and phone were both taken.\n\n\nWhen he got off the phone with the police he ranted about us not having security cameras and that we should have told them what the \u201csituation\u201d was like in our neighbourhood. He went on and on all morning. My husband and I were both apologetic and I really do feel bad.\n\n\nWhen they were leaving he said they wouldn\u2019t be back until we got security cameras and that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how\u201d we can \u201cstand\u201d living somewhere so \u201crisky\u201d and I just snapped. I told him we don\u2019t need security cameras because we aren\u2019t dumb enough to leave shit in our cars overnight and that I told them to bring their stuff in and that they are lucky more stuff wasn\u2019t stolen because I made them bring it inside.\n\n\nHe seemed shocked and just got into the car while my friend hugged me goodbye. Earlier I texted my friend to ask if they made it home alright and that I feel awful that their car was broken into. She responded that they made it home and that \u201cthese things happen\u201d.

And they have the guts and entitlement to tell you, you should've offered to pay?", "Right? I don\u2019t even leave my work computer in my car at work when I visit other job sites.
