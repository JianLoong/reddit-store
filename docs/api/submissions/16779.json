You\u2019re not a bad guy here, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a bad person either.

How about telling this girl - your friend - that it was too much for you, before you just lost your shit on her?

You're not her soundboard. You're not her therapist. No one wants to be around a person who is always complaining and miserable, and yet not taking steps to improve their situations in life (however best they can).  \n\nDon't second guess yourself on this. Being around a person who is constantly negative is draining and bad for your own mental and emotional well-being. It's good for you to stand up for yourself.

It's up to her to solve her problems and not take your friendship for granted. \n\nBased on the information you've given, I wonder if the reason you  feel conflicted is that you wish you'd offered warning shots or put up  'soft' boundaries first. If you had already said things like 'can we keep it upbeat today' / 'listen Sarah, I'm trying to build a more positive outlook right now so I'd appreciate it if we don't use our hangouts to moan' etc etc and she kept doing it, then its absolutely time to take a step back from the friendship.
