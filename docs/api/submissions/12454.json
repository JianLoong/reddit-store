I had honestly been insecure giving him a used gift - I was hoping it wouldn't come off like I was regifting old junk from my shop, but I figured it'd be fine since it was a more expensive tool (like $500 new) and all my friends know I've sworn off shopping new. \n\nBut I was honestly surprised how it went - I went to my friends party and gave him the welder, and it was by far the gift he was the most excited about and he was saying how it was way too nice of a gift, I shouldn't have, and that on top of me teaching him to use it? \n\nI was like \"Omg it's fine - honestly it's not new, and I'm just happy someone would use it because I haven't been! And joked that if he really felt like he owed me, he could learn how to use it on this fence I've been meaning to fix or replace.\" \n\nI started drinking with a bunch of my friends there and his girlfriend came up to me later saying \"she knew what I was doing getting him that gift\" \n\nI was fairly drunk and unserious and was like \"What, trying to bribe my way into getting my fence fixed?\" \n\nShe got mad and said that it was super inappropriate to get a guy in a relationship a really expensive gift, it was hundreds of dollars and she couldn't afford that kinda gift. Plus one that meant he was gonna hang out with me one on one? \n\nI was like \"girl when have you ever met a straight girl who likes welding? Like not to stereotype but... Look at me, do you really think I'm into your man?\" \n\nShe called me purposefully ignorant, and that it was just basic common sense to not get a guy friend a elaborate gift when he has a girlfriend. And not with a note asking to do something alone. \n\nI got mad and was like \"I didn't fucking say alone! You woulda been welcome if you asked literally any other way!\" \n\nShe said she didn't want to hang out when we welded my fence, she wanted me to back off and that \"every girl knows\" these rules about what's appropriate around taken guys. And I was like \"I dunno, that sounds like some straight people shit, I ain't always thinking about gender like that\" Which was honestly kinda petty of me, but that really made her mad. \n\nAITA for the gift I gave my friend, and how I reacted to his girlfriend?", "created_utc": 1678982901, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11syc3x/aita_for_getting_my_friend_a_more_expensive/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she's insecure over what a lesbian gives her boyfriend then she needs to take a hike.", "NTA. This gal sounds super insecure. As a straight guy, I would hope someone would warn me if a girlfriend was acting like this. What kind of insane stereotype does she believe in?", "NTA\n\nSomehow I dont think you'll have to worry about her by the next birthday", "NTA. That's not even straight girl shit. That's immature, insecure, attention-seeking, controlling, narcissistic girlfriend shit.", "NTA that must suck for her to be so insecure. \n\nYou sound like a wonderful friend!", "NTA. She should be excited that her boyfriend has this opportunity. He wants to learn how to weld and now he can, even if he can\u2019t afford the expensive equipment to get started. Her reaction is pure insecurity and the opposite of how a loving partner should react. It\u2019s also kind of homophobic, like she\u2019s denying that lesbians who are not attracted to men really exist.", "NTA for two reasons. \n\nA. His gf is insecure as hell. Tbh your sexuality shouldn\u2019t even be a part of this. You either trust your partner or you don\u2019t, and she clearly doesn\u2019t.\n\nB. Regifting/recycling something that you weren\u2019t using AND the other person will appreciate and get use out of is WONDERFUL! As a society we need to do more of this, and anyone who gets stuck up on the initial (ie sunk) cost of the item is completely missing the point. \n\nYou\u2019re a great friend, and I have a feeling that the gf won\u2019t be around much longer anyway with that kind of attitude.", "NTA - Her insecurities are her own. You gave your friend a nice gift. That's it, end of story. Why do people have to think there is always an ulterior motive.", "Lol NTA she is insecure as hell. What a nice gift. That\u2019s awesome.", "NTA.\n\nShe's showed a lot of her own insecurity there. It's not as if you've been wildly extravagant either; you've given him something you don't use.\n\nI gave my buddy a PA speaker, mixing desk and a set of lights that I don't use, but neither of our wives are chucking accusations at us!", "Absolutely NTA- full stop. If it was an inappropriate gift he would have refused the gift.", "NTA - She sounds massively insecure though. Wow. You did something super thoughtful and kind for your friend.", "Nice to meet you, I\u2019m a straight girl who likes MIG and TIG welding \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA at all, she sounds insecure \n\nMost of my mates are male, my husband is fine for us to hang out as he knows I\u2019m only interested in him romantically", "Absolutely NTA, an awesome friend though. GF is being weirdly insecure and taking it out on you", "NTA and happy welding to you too.  That's a great gift and way to keep things from being tossed.  The likely soon to be ex has major insecurity issues.", "NTA - Is his GF in high school? Because that would be super inappropriate.", "NTA. You gave a thoughtful gift to a friend. The girlfriend is insecure.", "NTA. This is not a rule that every straight person knows, because it\u2019s bs made up by a very insecure little girl. \n\nMy ex boyfriend was super into Lego and I bought him an expensive Lego set for Christmas. We ended up breaking up in December and agreed not to exchange gifts, and I planned to return it but forgot about it and missed the window. I ended up gifting it to my best friend\u2019s boyfriend who was the over the moon because he also loves Lego. And she was delighted that he got something that made him so happy, because, you know, she\u2019s a cool person and a nice girlfriend.", "NTA\n\nMaybe I'm purposefully ignorant too but i didnt know it was the girlfriend's responsibility to get the most expensive and well received gift. \n\nThe gf is jealous and it's not a good look", "NTA\n\nYou're right- That does sound like some straight people shit.", "Woman here. I didn\u2019t know \u201cthe rules\u201d. You\u2019re fine. You\u2019re a great friend who gifted a friend something thoughtful. She\u2019s insecure about not bei by able to afford pricy stuff, and she\u2019s taking it out on you. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nI gift my male friends expensive stuff sometimes. Their partners haven\u2019t made a fuss about it.", "I'll start with NTA. But... I'm a straight woman and I love welding. Hahaha! But seriously, the GF sounds like an insufferable child. I feel sorry for your friend. I hope he enjoys learning to weld and fixes your fence. Lol", "NTA\n\nIt didn't cost you anything, and it's a great gift to give a good friend. \n\nHer homophobia and jealousy is showing, and that's none of your business she needs to work that out with a therapist.", "NTA. She's just incredibly insecure and dumping that onto you. \n\nThe fact she confronted you instead of her own boyfriend, is rather telling: she knows she's being ridiculous and that if she would come to him with this complaint, he wouldn't respond positively, hence why she decided to go for you.", "Wow, sooo NTA. Your friend\u2019s gf sounds extremely insecure. She should be happy he has friends that care about him enough to give thoughtful gifts. If there was a rule about this I\u2019m certainly not aware of it lol", "Lmao NTA - you sound like a great friend. She sounds beyond insecure, if she is concerned that her boyfriend is going to chase after a lesbian then she has way bigger problems in her life. Like, what is she concerned about?", "NTA- um not any rules that I've heard of.  My friends buy each other what we think they will like/use and enjoy.  I do NOT wonder how much their partners are spending on gifts.\n\nThat girl needs to check herself and quit trying to start things where there is nothing to start.", "Lol NTA! I am also a woman who\u2019s partner is into wood working. I would love for his lesbian friends to gift him shop tools!", "NTA\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an expensive gift in terms of how much money you spent. You regifted something you don\u2019t use. \n\nThat\u2019s was 100% just an act of kindness, and maybe that\u2019s what really bothered her. You clearly were very thoughtful in your gift and it seems like she may be insecure that you had a more intimate type of gift. But you\u2019re a lesbian, I\u2019m curious how she\u2019d respond if a guy friend got this. \n\nAlso, im a lesbian too and you had me cracking up. I know queer women and I know women who weld\u2122\ufe0f,sure enough, that venmo diagram is a circle lmfao", "NTA. I don't know what \"rules\" she's talking about. It's BS. You were his friend before she showed up and will be his friend after he gets tired of her nonsense. You gave your friend a gift he will use and appreciate, like a good friend would.\n\nHer high school drama is childishly insecure and very self-centered. I'd let your friend know about the way she is treating you. He doesn't deserve to get blindsided by some petty jealous rage out of her.", "No, you are NTA. You gave a friend a thoughtful gift that you already had and weren't using. It's not like you took out a mortgage to buy her guy a gift. You were just being thoughtful and resourceful (and eco-friendly - good for you!). \n\nHis girl sounds really insecure. If she feels this threatened by an obvious lesbian ( I'm taking your word here that it is obvious) it really says more about how she feels about herself as a girlfriend than it does you. My guess is that she knows she really isn't that considerate of him, or that affectionate, or something... there has to be a reason for her insecurities, but they are not your fault.", "NTA - Her insecurity and possessiveness aren't your problem, and she's going to find out the hard way that trying to build walls between a dude and his friends is a good way to end up single again.", "NTA.  Her insecurity is not your problem.  You simply got your friend a gift that he likes.  His girlfriends financial issue and her inability to get a gift that\u2019s more expensive is not your concern or problem at all.", "NTA. She's insecure. Since you offered to teach him how to use it (probably the real reason she's upset) maybe ask if she would also want to learn. It's awesome that you have this skill, and there's nothing better than building up other women. If she isn't interested, then move on, but it might alleviate some of her feelings of jealousy.", "NTA.\nThis seems like an amazing gift. You give something really meaningful, you *don\u2019t* have to spend hundreds to do it, and you are being sustainable.", "NTA. She's insecure financially or in the relationship or both. If my partner got something they were excited for sure I'd be secretly sad that I couldn't top it but that would be immediately outweighed by how happy I am for them. It has nothing to do with how any of you identify in your sexuality and all to do with her not caring that he was happy to get something for his literal birthday. He should be questioning a life with someone that will be cautious and analytical of every success he has.", "NTA. Like you said, its something used that your friend wanted anyways. I can see if you went out of your way to purchase it and had 0 idea how to use it but its a tool thats lying around. It her insecurities that are the problem.", "NTA for the question of course. Straight girl here and don't understand the notion of gender having anything to do with who you're friends with. Hopefully your friend will see that he can do better than Miss Posessive.\n\nBuuut you are a tiny bit of an AH for the comment about straight girls and welding. Sadly I don't know how yet, but have wanted to learn for ages. I think you were probably being jokey about it, but please can we all stop it with the gender prejudices? (And it's something that gets shoved down our throats all our lives, so it's not easy to check ourselves.)", "Info: did your friend hear this interaction or say anything about it after? NTA of course", "NTA, I want a lesbian friend that gifts me tools as well!", "NTA, although I would back off if your friend intends to stay in a relationship with this women. Demote both of them to acquaintance. Hang out with them in a group setting if you want, but never one on one, and do the welding yourself. \n\nRemaining in his life could just make this unreasonable  girlfriend more unreasonable, and cause problems for both of you in the long run. I\u2019d say it\u2019s time to just let it go and cut ties. Surround yourself with drama free people who don\u2019t do this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not that you\u2019d be trying to steal him (obviously!) but just seems over the top and unnecessary.  But it was something you had sitting around and weren\u2019t using! Still very nice and generous of you, but totally different.", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis girlfriend would not be saying this if you were a dude-bro giving him the cast-off mig tool. Unless this is a pattern of how she treats you specifically; it rather sounds like the normal cis-hetero bullshit. \n\nLike if you weren't gay, a more thoughtful gift by hetero girl would/could be seen as intent to horn in. That would still be wrong assumption by her even if you were a straight girl bro to your friend. It quite possibly could be a bit more understandable coming from an insecure woman. But most certainly not for a controlling woman.\n\nI think you did just fine.

He mightn't have realized that his GF is quite so insecure.", "NTA. She's from planet insecurity.", "Lots of straight women weld. But NTA for buying the gift.", "NTA! \nShe's so insecure it's crazy. There are a bunch of unwritten social mores about gift giving. Which is why you felt nervous about giving a used gift.  But it is some BS on her part to come at you like that- because \"no one should give a gift that their romantic partner could not, or  that is more well received.\" Is certainly not one of them!\n\nShe's just pissed not to be the center of his attention on his birthday. \n\nThis isn't some everybody knows/girl code bs. Would she have a leg to stand on if you'd gotten him something intimate - possibly - but we're talking about a welding rig. Not a sex toy. Her insinuation that you were trying to do something by giving him a freaking welding tool?  Your response of \"what, get my fence fixed?\" Was totally on point. And you were right to jump to - do I *look* straight to you? Because she was implying you were trying to steal her man. \n\nIf she's got a problem with the gift you gave her boyfriend and seeing some weird plot in it? She should be addressing her concerns with her boyfriend. If she's insecure about you spending time with your friend, even *gasp* alone - again she should be talking to her boyfriend. \n\nThis strikes me as not just insecure, but possessive on her part. Yikes.", "I would love someone to teach me to weld!\nDo I need to question my sexuality?", "NTA. It's a great gift. It's thoughtful and something he would use. You're obviously not trying to seduce him; you're not interested in that. Would she have had a fit if a man gave him that? That's just sexist and ridiculous. His gf needs to get over herself.", "Nta.

It was an expensive looking piece of equipment but OP didn't even buy it. She owned it and decided to give it as a gift to her friend who would make use of it. It's the GF who's apparently insecure enough to think there were any ulterior motives\u2026 after being upstaged by a thoughtful gift.", "Yeah sorry about that, I was being too stereotyping. \n\nThe trade school I went to was literally all straight men and gay women, but yeah that's not universal so thanks for calling me out a little!", "Totally apropos!!!
