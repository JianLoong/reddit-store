If she's insecure over what a lesbian gives her boyfriend then she needs to take a hike.", "NTA. This gal sounds super insecure. As a straight guy, I would hope someone would warn me if a girlfriend was acting like this. What kind of insane stereotype does she believe in?", "NTA\n\nSomehow I dont think you'll have to worry about her by the next birthday", "NTA. That's not even straight girl shit. That's immature, insecure, attention-seeking, controlling, narcissistic girlfriend shit.", "NTA that must suck for her to be so insecure. \n\nYou sound like a wonderful friend!", "NTA. She should be excited that her boyfriend has this opportunity. He wants to learn how to weld and now he can, even if he can\u2019t afford the expensive equipment to get started. Her reaction is pure insecurity and the opposite of how a loving partner should react. It\u2019s also kind of homophobic, like she\u2019s denying that lesbians who are not attracted to men really exist.", "NTA for two reasons. \n\nA. His gf is insecure as hell. Tbh your sexuality shouldn\u2019t even be a part of this. You either trust your partner or you don\u2019t, and she clearly doesn\u2019t.\n\nB. Regifting/recycling something that you weren\u2019t using AND the other person will appreciate and get use out of is WONDERFUL! As a society we need to do more of this, and anyone who gets stuck up on the initial (ie sunk) cost of the item is completely missing the point. \n\nYou\u2019re a great friend, and I have a feeling that the gf won\u2019t be around much longer anyway with that kind of attitude.", "NTA - Her insecurities are her own. You gave your friend a nice gift. That's it, end of story. Why do people have to think there is always an ulterior motive.", "Lol NTA she is insecure as hell. What a nice gift. That\u2019s awesome.", "NTA.\n\nShe's showed a lot of her own insecurity there. It's not as if you've been wildly extravagant either; you've given him something you don't use.\n\nI gave my buddy a PA speaker, mixing desk and a set of lights that I don't use, but neither of our wives are chucking accusations at us!", "Absolutely NTA- full stop. If it was an inappropriate gift he would have refused the gift.", "NTA - She sounds massively insecure though. Wow. You did something super thoughtful and kind for your friend.", "Nice to meet you, I\u2019m a straight girl who likes MIG and TIG welding \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA at all, she sounds insecure \n\nMost of my mates are male, my husband is fine for us to hang out as he knows I\u2019m only interested in him romantically", "Absolutely NTA, an awesome friend though.

The likely soon to be ex has major insecurity issues.", "NTA - Is his GF in high school? Because that would be super inappropriate.", "NTA. You gave a thoughtful gift to a friend. The girlfriend is insecure.", "NTA. This is not a rule that every straight person knows, because it\u2019s bs made up by a very insecure little girl. \n\nMy ex boyfriend was super into Lego and I bought him an expensive Lego set for Christmas.

I ended up gifting it to my best friend\u2019s boyfriend who was the over the moon because he also loves Lego.

I feel sorry for your friend. I hope he enjoys learning to weld and fixes your fence.

She's just incredibly insecure and dumping that onto you. \n\nThe fact she confronted you instead of her own boyfriend, is rather telling: she knows she's being ridiculous and that if she would come to him with this complaint, he wouldn't respond positively, hence why she decided to go for you.", "Wow, sooo NTA. Your friend\u2019s gf sounds extremely insecure. She should be happy he has friends that care about him enough to give thoughtful gifts. If there was a rule about this I\u2019m certainly not aware of it lol", "Lmao NTA - you sound like a great friend. She sounds beyond insecure, if she is concerned that her boyfriend is going to chase after a lesbian then she has way bigger problems in her life. Like, what is she concerned about?", "NTA- um not any rules that I've heard of.  My friends buy each other what we think they will like/use and enjoy.  I do NOT wonder how much their partners are spending on gifts.\n\nThat girl needs to check herself and quit trying to start things where there is nothing to start.", "Lol NTA! I am also a woman who\u2019s partner is into wood working. I would love for his lesbian friends to gift him shop tools!", "NTA\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an expensive gift in terms of how much money you spent. You regifted something you don\u2019t use. \n\nThat\u2019s was 100% just an act of kindness, and maybe that\u2019s what really bothered her. You clearly were very thoughtful in your gift and it seems like she may be insecure that you had a more intimate type of gift. But you\u2019re a lesbian, I\u2019m curious how she\u2019d respond if a guy friend got this. \n\nAlso, im a lesbian too and you had me cracking up. I know queer women and I know women who weld\u2122\ufe0f,sure enough, that venmo diagram is a circle lmfao", "NTA. I don't know what \"rules\" she's talking about. It's BS. You were his friend before she showed up and will be his friend after he gets tired of her nonsense. You gave your friend a gift he will use and appreciate, like a good friend would.\n\nHer high school drama is childishly insecure and very self-centered. I'd let your friend know about the way she is treating you. He doesn't deserve to get blindsided by some petty jealous rage out of her.", "No, you are NTA. You gave a friend a thoughtful gift that you already had and weren't using. It's not like you took out a mortgage to buy her guy a gift. You were just being thoughtful and resourceful (and eco-friendly - good for you!). \n\nHis girl sounds really insecure. If she feels this threatened by an obvious lesbian ( I'm taking your word here that it is obvious) it really says more about how she feels about herself as a girlfriend than it does you. My guess is that she knows she really isn't that considerate of him, or that affectionate, or something... there has to be a reason for her insecurities, but they are not your fault.", "NTA - Her insecurity and possessiveness aren't your problem, and she's going to find out the hard way that trying to build walls between a dude and his friends is a good way to end up single again.", "NTA.  Her insecurity is not your problem.  You simply got your friend a gift that he likes.  His girlfriends financial issue and her inability to get a gift that\u2019s more expensive is not your concern or problem at all.", "NTA. She's insecure. Since you offered to teach him how to use it (probably the real reason she's upset) maybe ask if she would also want to learn. It's awesome that you have this skill, and there's nothing better than building up other women. If she isn't interested, then move on, but it might alleviate some of her feelings of jealousy.", "NTA.\nThis seems like an amazing gift. You give something really meaningful, you *don\u2019t* have to spend hundreds to do it, and you are being sustainable.", "NTA. She's insecure financially or in the relationship or both. If my partner got something they were excited for sure I'd be secretly sad that I couldn't top it but that would be immediately outweighed by how happy I am for them. It has nothing to do with how any of you identify in your sexuality and all to do with her not caring that he was happy to get something for his literal birthday. He should be questioning a life with someone that will be cautious and analytical of every success he has.", "NTA. Like you said, its something used that your friend wanted anyways. I can see if you went out of your way to purchase it and had 0 idea how to use it but its a tool thats lying around. It her insecurities that are the problem.", "NTA for the question of course. Straight girl here and don't understand the notion of gender having anything to do with who you're friends with. Hopefully your friend will see that he can do better than Miss Posessive.\n\nBuuut you are a tiny bit of an AH for the comment about straight girls and welding. Sadly I don't know how yet, but have wanted to learn for ages. I think you were probably being jokey about it, but please can we all stop it with the gender prejudices? (And it's something that gets shoved down our throats all our lives, so it's not easy to check ourselves.)", "Info: did your friend hear this interaction or say anything about it after? NTA of course", "NTA, I want a lesbian friend that gifts me tools as well!", "NTA, although I would back off if your friend intends to stay in a relationship with this women. Demote both of them to acquaintance. Hang out with them in a group setting if you want, but never one on one, and do the welding yourself. \n\nRemaining in his life could just make this unreasonable  girlfriend more unreasonable, and cause problems for both of you in the long run. I\u2019d say it\u2019s time to just let it go and cut ties. Surround yourself with drama free people who don\u2019t do this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There are a bunch of unwritten social mores about gift giving. Which is why you felt nervous about giving a used gift.  But it is some BS on her part to come at you like that- because \"no one should give a gift that their romantic partner could not, or  that is more well received.\" Is certainly not one of them!\n\nShe's just pissed not to be the center of his attention on his birthday. \n\nThis isn't some everybody knows/girl code bs. Would she have a leg to stand on if you'd gotten him something intimate - possibly - but we're talking about a welding rig. Not a sex toy. Her insinuation that you were trying to do something by giving him a freaking welding tool?  Your response of \"what, get my fence fixed?\" Was totally on point. And you were right to jump to - do I *look* straight to you? Because she was implying you were trying to steal her man. \n\nIf she's got a problem with the gift you gave her boyfriend and seeing some weird plot in it? She should be addressing her concerns with her boyfriend. If she's insecure about you spending time with your friend, even *gasp* alone - again she should be talking to her boyfriend. \n\nThis strikes me as not just insecure, but possessive on her part. Yikes.", "I would love someone to teach me to weld!\nDo I need to question my sexuality?", "NTA. It's a great gift. It's thoughtful and something he would use.

NTA.\n\nI would have called her immature for not being able to handle her BF having a close friend who is a woman alone, but the fact that you are a lesbian makes it downright comical.

Like really, a freaking idiot.\n\nNTA - aside from cleaning it up the cost of the gift was $$ ZERO $$\n\nWhat g.f. is tripping about is the boy's enthusiastic reaction, probably much more than to anything she gave him, and that you chose an excellent present which demonstrated that you know him better.", "As a straight woman, I can\u2019t imagine getting mad at one of my husband\u2019s friends for giving him a thoughtful gift. NTA.", "NTA and not even CLOSE, I\u2019m second-hand embarrassed for the gf\u2019s future self reflecting on her reaction LOL. Toxic AF.\n\nThat was an incredible gift for your friend and i think you handled the gf\u2019s weird ass reaction beautifully!", "NTA OP and I love the petty answers! :D I think it was super sweet of you and girlfriend should just be happy for your friend", "NTA\n\nIt's her insecurities that she needs to work on. You didn't did anything wrong by giving your friend a thoughtful gift like that", "\n\n10/10", "Somehow I dont think you'll have to worry about her by the next birthday", "Wow. She\u2019s one insecure sloppy bag of crap. NTA. Great gift.", "Haha, of course she is mad. You just exposed her as a shitty GF. \nNot because of your very thoughtful gift, but because of her reaction to it. She should be happy for him or at least fake happy and keep her jealousy to her self.\nNTA, and as a sidenote, I hope that her openly ugly behaviour was mostly caused by intoxication and that she apologizes to you later.", "Nta even if you were straight", "I did this accidently once. I won a whole signed music set from a guy friend's favorite band. Saved it and gave it to him for his birthday. His girlfriend smiled but the kind of smile that doesn't meet your eyes type smile. For me it was giving away something I had gotten for free. For her, nothing she could give him would have measured up. I wasn't trying to show her up. It just worked out that way.", "NTA. It sounds as if she is afraid you are trying to turn her boyfriend lesbian, which suggests she is a little confused about life.", "That's a great gift!  Hopefully, one day, he'll get a girlfriend who isn't a complete biotch.", "Birthday gift giving isn't a contest \n\nBut if she wants to act like a loser? Let her. \n\nNta.", "This cracked me up so hard ahahahhahhahaha \u2764\ufe0f", "This is some straight people shit. I have seen a birthday party go to hell because one female friend of ours got an overly personalized cake for the birthday boy whose gf had already gotten a nice enough cake. The gf was mad. As na objective observer, I would say the gf was right. What the other girl did looked really odd. It\u2019s was just a get together and drink kinda party. That cake would take days or weeks of pre ordering. She was definitely trying to show off she cared more. She also kept talking about stories with the birthday boy where his gf was not present or was not yet his gf. Very weird night overall to witness. At a point I quietly started drinking with another group of strangers.", "That's not straight people shit though, it's insecure people shit. Straight people don't have to be pathetic bags of paranoia and innuendo, that's a special bonus from the gf."]}
