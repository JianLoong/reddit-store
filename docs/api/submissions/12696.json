If she wants to name her Crystal, name her Crystal. She tried to explain to me why the x's are there and I just told her it does not matter. She's naming a human, not a dog.

I told my sister she was being either selfish, stupid, or an incredibly strong combination of the two if she thinks her daughter will want a stupid name like Krxstxl. We got into an argument and I told her I already see her and her husband as shitty parents for using their kid to be off-brand with her name and left right after. \n\nMy sister is not taking it well at all and my mom is furious with me.

The name sounds like it's from a video game, and you probably just let out anger that was in you onto them because of your name, and you didn't fully mean what you said. You already made it clear you don't support them and stated why using your examples. I would say your parents are only slight assholes, but it's not really something they even realize. They need to change their naming style, but you won't change their minds. On the topic of changing names, maybe you didn't have enough money or your parents didn't give you any to help with that. Also, when you're \"Krxstxl's\" age you can't change your name. That can affect someone's life from the start, even if it's changed eventually. Really, you're all somewhat an asshole in this situation, and you need to get your mentality fixed too, because everyone was acting on impulse in the specific situation you're talking about. Just get your emotions in check before you do anything else, because it sounds like your brain is going bonkers because of your name and what it did to you.

If and when you niece is annoyed by hers, tell her she can when she is an adult, and you will help her.  4) when she is born, come up with an adorable uncle only nickname for her.  \u201cNiecelet\u201d, \u201cItsybits\u201d, \u201cBean\u201d, whatever, something innocuous that you always call her, that any rational person thinks is cute.

The only way for your sister to back down on the name now is to admit she was being a shitty parent before even giving birth, which is much harder to do than just change your mind about a name.

You put your 2 cents in where it wasn\u2019t wanted, thankfully this younger generation doesn\u2019t seem to care too much about names. If you\u2019re named Applebeighz, Weighleigh or whatever crazy name the parent chose they\u2019ll still be okay.", "YTA. yeah, it\u2019s a bad name, and you have a right to an opinion, but this isn\u2019t your child and you definitely shouldn\u2019t be calling your sister stupid and shitty", "Unfortunately YTA. This is a bit of an essay, but I have a good amount of experience with childcare and education so I have some points to go over.\n\nKeeping the criticisms to the name only would have landed you as N/T/A, but I've worked with kids for 7 years now and I've met plenty of kids with names in that category of \"ridiculous\" who come from incredibly loving and devoted households to their child's growth and needs. Especially with calling a kid's name \"off brand\" while complaining about kid's names being used as fashion statements, where's the consistency with that? You want kids to have \"on brand\" names but don't want kid's names to be making a statement?\n\nUnfortunate newsflash: every name is a statement, especially in a kid's eyes. I once had a classroom a few years back of around 27 kids and FIVE of them were named Emily. Do you have any idea how that effected the esteem and self perception of some of those Emilys? Very unfortunately, it was not good. **I have seen kids bullied for overly unique \"fashion statement\" names. I have seen kids bullied for having names that come from their culture that aren't typical in the US. And I have seen kids bullied for having extremely common and \"normal\" names. I have literally heard children bullying the Emilys, Emmas, Jordans, and Liams around them saying that their parents must not care about them or must have 0 expectations about them to name them something after googling for 2 minutes. THAT is the cruelty of children.** Giving a child a \"normal\" name, you have to look very very carefully at that kind of idea because even a name considered to be \"normal\" by adults can still end up with the kid being bullied over their name. Would you also argue that parents have to go ahead and formally change their last names as well if they're easily mockable by children?\n\nYour anger over the poor treatment you received over having a feminine name should be re-directed at least a bit at the people who treated you poorly. Yes your parents didn't give you a strong hand, but you could have very well ended up like my classroom full of Emilys, where most of them one by one spoke to me privately about what changing their name would look like and voicing fears taught to them by other kids that their parents didn't even care enough about them to give them a \"special\" name.\n\nAlso, that name bullying varies greatly depending on the community you live in. There were huge issues of name bullying at the last place I worked at before I moved to my new community. And that's when I learned something fantastic about children: **When more children than not are raised correctly and respect the teachings of the adults around them, name bullying isn't an issue.** I have a young student right now who has a name with not one but TWO apostrophes in it. I've been working with this kid for months now and not once have I ever heard a single targeted insult or tease his direction over his name. Kids simply learned his name, and went with it. He's not the only one with an overtly unique name in this pool of kids. All of the kids I work with now, in comparison to the last crowd I worked with, take the time and effort to learn a name properly and respect that. All the way down to the first and second graders. We do have girls with traditionally masculine names, and vice versa. I haven't heard a second of teasing over their names here. I haven't gotten any complaints from the kids of this happening when I'm not looking and believe me they will come sprinting to me if they feel the need over some very minor conflicts. **So if your concerns are genuine, take a look at the community this kid will grow up in to make a more grounded case for why this shouldn't be her name.**\n\n**If you truly can't live with your first name, there are legal processes to formally change it. I've done it.** It's often recommended for people who grow up in unhappy households because it helps alleviate the \"baggage\" that comes with hearing their own name. **If you think your name has caused you nothing but problems and there's not a single positive facet to find in the first name you were given, you can change it.** While I can't say I like the name your sister has chosen *at all*, the same avenue will be available for her own child. It's also wrong to take out your resentment on a set of people other than your parents for the name you were given and those who treated you poorly for it. You could have also come at this constructively in a way to \"protect\" the child, like suggesting that name become her middle name and she be given a first name that can help her \"mesh\" better with her peers. Instead, you blew up and insulted their overall ability to parent which will most likely cause them to double down in their decision making further. **The unfortunate reality is, no matter how right you are, if you're seeking to change a stubborn mind you have to approach that conversation calmly and constructively in order to make progress.**", "I\u2019m sorry you never got over your name, I suspect your future niece will, but experience similar problems. Thing is man, YTA, unfortunately even though you\u2019re looking out for her, you\u2019re not the parent.", "YTA\n\nIt's pretty obvious the name is pronounced Crystal.

I'm from a small German community in southern USA, comprised of a small number of German families who emigrated together and made a small community. Everyone knows everyone, and some people still speak German, (some grandparents speak only German!). It's so insular that many people don't even follow current events or watch the news.\n\nMy twin brother and I were both named after our father and his twin sister, who were named for their father and their father (you get the idea).   We have a lot of twins in my family.  Apparently every male in my family, going back 9+ generations (we can only count 9) and many of the daughters have been named Adolf and Eva. They say Adolf a lovely name and we shouldn't let 1 person ruin a lovely family name.\n\nIf they don't think a name can instantly doom a kid to being a social outcast and merciless bullying, trying changing your name to Adolf for a month and see how many friends you lose! Pairing it with Eva, especially as a twin when many assume names are intentionally paired, is, ... unfortunate. To say the least. Adolf used to be a very popular name in Germany until WWII, when the name suddenly dropped off (can't imagine why!!). Eva is still a popular name around the world, even today, so I got off lightly on bullying, until people learned about my twin brother. \n\nIt affected my relationship with my twin as well! While we were very close, and often each other's best friend (and often only friends), he accuses me of trying to hide him sometimes, and I'm sure his feelings are still hurt about it. To be honest, I did sometimes. It was so nice to have a friend.... for a few days ... until the unfortunate \"don't you know who her brother is?!?\" gossip started, and no amount of explaining can undo \"Adolf and Eva\". Even when I could explain it, once their parents found out about us it was all over. I never ever once had a friend sleep over at my house, for example. Who's going to let their kids sleep over at the home of Adolf and Eva?  \n\nPeople instantly assumed I, as his twin sister, was also a racist/ white supremacist, along with my poor brother. I'm pretty sure my teachers hated us too. Because of our small community, elementary school was okay. But middle school joined us with some other elementary schools, and it all went up in smoke. Suddenly our friends from kindergarten didn't want to be seen with us which was really painful. He was my only friend. We ate lunch together everyday.\n\nHigh school was the worst. The absolute worst. Both our homeroom teacher AND the most popular kid in school were Jewish and made it their mission in life to make us pay for the Holocaust.  Of course we tried to explain the reason why I was Eva and he was Adolf, but any explaining just seemed to make things worse. I'm sure that teacher made sure we were in separate classes or senior year. Every. Single. Class. Even lunch. That meant we both ate alone. Except when someone would sit with us as a prank.  I knew it was a prank but was so happy for the company I didn't care.  It was lonely and painful.\n\nOur father claims he was never bullied. I wonder if he's either being truthful and was surrounded by racists, or if he was just incredibly oblivious.\n\nOUR STORY HAS A HAPPY ENDING!!\n\n Our parents told him that if he changed his name, ending a long standing and cherished family tradition, they would disinherit him and never speak to him again. (Not that there's much to inherit.) He didn't care, especially because I promised him of course I would split everything equally with him, if there's anything, my much loved brother and best friend. \n\nSo.... On his 18th birthday, he legally changed his name to Adie (his nickname growing up to sound different from our dad who as mentioned was also Adolf.). \n\nAfter college he went backpacking. He met a lovely Israeli girl (also a twin!), who I assume was also very understanding. He changed his name again, met her family, got married, moved to Israel, and has a set of twins himself! \n\nHe said they'd name them ... ANYTHING but Adolf and Eva.\n\nNTA: Your child is a human being, who will likely live past you and carry that name until the day they die! Make a poor choice, and they will pay! You can't change the world with a name. They wanted to believe they could change the world's opinion of a name and show it was more than just 1 hated man, but in the end they just made their children miserable!!", "Fahrvergnugen, is that you?", "I went to school with a girl whose name was \"C-Aira\".\n\nNot pronounced like Cara or Caira. Her name was actually supposed to be pronounced as \"Sierra\".", "Seems Welsh lol", "It\u2019s hilarious to me that you used the examples of Ulrike and Xochitl! My sister was friends with a German foreign exchange student when she was in high school. She was at our house a lot and I adored her! I also happened to attend high school with a great gal by the name of Xochitl! That\u2019s such an odd choice of names you used! Thanks for the flood of happy memories!\n\nThe topic brought up by OP is dear to my heart. My parents gave my youngest brother what had become a girl\u2019s name by the time he was born. He, too, was bullied over, just as I had told my parents would happen. It\u2019s the only thing I never forgave them for. \n\nThe name OP\u2019s sister has chosen is going to do the same, but for a different reason. The kid is going to be harassed over it all of her life, unless she decides to change it. Teachers, I guarantee, will hate the name because you can\u2019t easily tell how to pronounce it, and once you know how to pronounce it you won\u2019t remember how to spell it. It isn\u2019t clever, special, or cute. It\u2019s an albatross. I might add as a college professor I\u2019ve had a number of students with \u201ccreative\u201d names that hated their names. When I asked if they\u2019d consider changing it most said that they didn\u2019t want to hurt their parent\u2019s feelings. A couple planned to change once the graduated. Once choice to go by her middle name professionally as her first name was so \u201cbabyish\u201d and cute. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, OP, that your family has belittled your concerns over the years. That sucks. I hope your sister wises up.\n\nThat said, you could have been much more diplomatic. Your anger shut them down, I\u2019m afraid. You should, at least, apologize for getting so angry and for cussing. You don\u2019t need to apologize for disagreeing with their name choice. Just call your niece Kris, Chrissy, or some grown up nickname that\u2019s compatible with her given name. You\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to say \u201cI warned you\u201d and to commiserate with your niece. Who knows? With luck maybe people will be over teasing people about their names by the time she\u2019s in school!", "To be fair, I'd love to be named Brunhilde.
