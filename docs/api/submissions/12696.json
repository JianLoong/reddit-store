The name sounds like it's from a video game, and you probably just let out anger that was in you onto them because of your name, and you didn't fully mean what you said. You already made it clear you don't support them and stated why using your examples. I would say your parents are only slight assholes, but it's not really something they even realize. They need to change their naming style, but you won't change their minds. On the topic of changing names, maybe you didn't have enough money or your parents didn't give you any to help with that. Also, when you're \"Krxstxl's\" age you can't change your name. That can affect someone's life from the start, even if it's changed eventually. Really, you're all somewhat an asshole in this situation, and you need to get your mentality fixed too, because everyone was acting on impulse in the specific situation you're talking about. Just get your emotions in check before you do anything else, because it sounds like your brain is going bonkers because of your name and what it did to you.

She isn\u2019t gonna get bullied for it.  Relax.  3) legally change your own name.  If and when you niece is annoyed by hers, tell her she can when she is an adult, and you will help her.  4) when she is born, come up with an adorable uncle only nickname for her.  \u201cNiecelet\u201d, \u201cItsybits\u201d, \u201cBean\u201d, whatever, something innocuous that you always call her, that any rational person thinks is cute.

The only way for your sister to back down on the name now is to admit she was being a shitty parent before even giving birth, which is much harder to do than just change your mind about a name.

You put your 2 cents in where it wasn\u2019t wanted, thankfully this younger generation doesn\u2019t seem to care too much about names. If you\u2019re named Applebeighz, Weighleigh or whatever crazy name the parent chose they\u2019ll still be okay.", "YTA. yeah, it\u2019s a bad name, and you have a right to an opinion, but this isn\u2019t your child and you definitely shouldn\u2019t be calling your sister stupid and shitty", "Unfortunately YTA. This is a bit of an essay, but I have a good amount of experience with childcare and education so I have some points to go over.\n\nKeeping the criticisms to the name only would have landed you as N/T/A, but I've worked with kids for 7 years now and I've met plenty of kids with names in that category of \"ridiculous\" who come from incredibly loving and devoted households to their child's growth and needs. Especially with calling a kid's name \"off brand\" while complaining about kid's names being used as fashion statements, where's the consistency with that? You want kids to have \"on brand\" names but don't want kid's names to be making a statement?\n\nUnfortunate newsflash: every name is a statement, especially in a kid's eyes. I once had a classroom a few years back of around 27 kids and FIVE of them were named Emily. Do you have any idea how that effected the esteem and self perception of some of those Emilys? Very unfortunately, it was not good. **I have seen kids bullied for overly unique \"fashion statement\" names. I have seen kids bullied for having names that come from their culture that aren't typical in the US. And I have seen kids bullied for having extremely common and \"normal\" names. I have literally heard children bullying the Emilys, Emmas, Jordans, and Liams around them saying that their parents must not care about them or must have 0 expectations about them to name them something after googling for 2 minutes. THAT is the cruelty of children.** Giving a child a \"normal\" name, you have to look very very carefully at that kind of idea because even a name considered to be \"normal\" by adults can still end up with the kid being bullied over their name. Would you also argue that parents have to go ahead and formally change their last names as well if they're easily mockable by children?\n\nYour anger over the poor treatment you received over having a feminine name should be re-directed at least a bit at the people who treated you poorly. Yes your parents didn't give you a strong hand, but you could have very well ended up like my classroom full of Emilys, where most of them one by one spoke to me privately about what changing their name would look like and voicing fears taught to them by other kids that their parents didn't even care enough about them to give them a \"special\" name.\n\nAlso, that name bullying varies greatly depending on the community you live in. There were huge issues of name bullying at the last place I worked at before I moved to my new community. And that's when I learned something fantastic about children: **When more children than not are raised correctly and respect the teachings of the adults around them, name bullying isn't an issue.** I have a young student right now who has a name with not one but TWO apostrophes in it. I've been working with this kid for months now and not once have I ever heard a single targeted insult or tease his direction over his name. Kids simply learned his name, and went with it. He's not the only one with an overtly unique name in this pool of kids. All of the kids I work with now, in comparison to the last crowd I worked with, take the time and effort to learn a name properly and respect that. All the way down to the first and second graders. We do have girls with traditionally masculine names, and vice versa. I haven't heard a second of teasing over their names here. I haven't gotten any complaints from the kids of this happening when I'm not looking and believe me they will come sprinting to me if they feel the need over some very minor conflicts. **So if your concerns are genuine, take a look at the community this kid will grow up in to make a more grounded case for why this shouldn't be her name.**\n\n**If you truly can't live with your first name, there are legal processes to formally change it. I've done it.** It's often recommended for people who grow up in unhappy households because it helps alleviate the \"baggage\" that comes with hearing their own name. **If you think your name has caused you nothing but problems and there's not a single positive facet to find in the first name you were given, you can change it.** While I can't say I like the name your sister has chosen *at all*, the same avenue will be available for her own child. It's also wrong to take out your resentment on a set of people other than your parents for the name you were given and those who treated you poorly for it. You could have also come at this constructively in a way to \"protect\" the child, like suggesting that name become her middle name and she be given a first name that can help her \"mesh\" better with her peers. Instead, you blew up and insulted their overall ability to parent which will most likely cause them to double down in their decision making further. **The unfortunate reality is, no matter how right you are, if you're seeking to change a stubborn mind you have to approach that conversation calmly and constructively in order to make progress.**", "I\u2019m sorry you never got over your name, I suspect your future niece will, but experience similar problems. Thing is man, YTA, unfortunately even though you\u2019re looking out for her, you\u2019re not the parent.", "YTA\n\nIt's pretty obvious the name is pronounced Crystal.
