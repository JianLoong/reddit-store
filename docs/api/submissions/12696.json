I am a man who was given a woman's name at birth. A good example is naming your son Alice. It's not what my name was but it's close. My parents are hippies and gave their oldest son a girl's name to \"stick it to the man\" and  I will never forgive them for it. That name caused me to be bullied and damaged my professional life in ways I cannot describe. \n\nMy sister is pregnant with her first child. A girl. She and her husband are ecstatic, it just sucks that she inherited my parent's stupid propensity to see their children as fashion statements. Last night, she revealed to the family the name of her daughter.\n\nIt's Krxstxl. She wants to name her daughter Krxstxl. Confused, the name is pronounced Crystal. I already don't like that name but it's at least appropriate. I was not surprised to learn that my mom helped come up with the name.\n\nWhen she told me, I told her it was a terrible idea. If she wants to name her Crystal, name her Crystal. She tried to explain to me why the x's are there and I just told her it does not matter. She's naming a human, not a dog. I don't care what kind of fashion statement she's trying to make, this is a person who will have to live with that name until they die or has it changed. \n\nShe and my mom brushed me off as just complaining because I was never able to accept my name. I told my sister she was being either selfish, stupid, or an incredibly strong combination of the two if she thinks her daughter will want a stupid name like Krxstxl. We got into an argument and I told her I already see her and her husband as shitty parents for using their kid to be off-brand with her name and left right after. \n\nMy sister is not taking it well at all and my mom is furious with me. I'm starting to wonder if I was too harsh. I will not change my opinion on that incredibly stupid name.

The name sounds like it's from a video game, and you probably just let out anger that was in you onto them because of your name, and you didn't fully mean what you said. You already made it clear you don't support them and stated why using your examples. I would say your parents are only slight assholes, but it's not really something they even realize. They need to change their naming style, but you won't change their minds. On the topic of changing names, maybe you didn't have enough money or your parents didn't give you any to help with that. Also, when you're \"Krxstxl's\" age you can't change your name. That can affect someone's life from the start, even if it's changed eventually. Really, you're all somewhat an asshole in this situation, and you need to get your mentality fixed too, because everyone was acting on impulse in the specific situation you're talking about. Just get your emotions in check before you do anything else, because it sounds like your brain is going bonkers because of your name and what it did to you.

This is a bit of an essay, but I have a good amount of experience with childcare and education so I have some points to go over.\n\nKeeping the criticisms to the name only would have landed you as N/T/A, but I've worked with kids for 7 years now and I've met plenty of kids with names in that category of \"ridiculous\" who come from incredibly loving and devoted households to their child's growth and needs. Especially with calling a kid's name \"off brand\" while complaining about kid's names being used as fashion statements, where's the consistency with that? You want kids to have \"on brand\" names but don't want kid's names to be making a statement?\n\nUnfortunate newsflash: every name is a statement, especially in a kid's eyes. I once had a classroom a few years back of around 27 kids and FIVE of them were named Emily. Do you have any idea how that effected the esteem and self perception of some of those Emilys? Very unfortunately, it was not good. **I have seen kids bullied for overly unique \"fashion statement\" names. I have seen kids bullied for having names that come from their culture that aren't typical in the US. And I have seen kids bullied for having extremely common and \"normal\" names. I have literally heard children bullying the Emilys, Emmas, Jordans, and Liams around them saying that their parents must not care about them or must have 0 expectations about them to name them something after googling for 2 minutes. THAT is the cruelty of children.** Giving a child a \"normal\" name, you have to look very very carefully at that kind of idea because even a name considered to be \"normal\" by adults can still end up with the kid being bullied over their name. Would you also argue that parents have to go ahead and formally change their last names as well if they're easily mockable by children?\n\nYour anger over the poor treatment you received over having a feminine name should be re-directed at least a bit at the people who treated you poorly. Yes your parents didn't give you a strong hand, but you could have very well ended up like my classroom full of Emilys, where most of them one by one spoke to me privately about what changing their name would look like and voicing fears taught to them by other kids that their parents didn't even care enough about them to give them a \"special\" name.\n\nAlso, that name bullying varies greatly depending on the community you live in. There were huge issues of name bullying at the last place I worked at before I moved to my new community. And that's when I learned something fantastic about children: **When more children than not are raised correctly and respect the teachings of the adults around them, name bullying isn't an issue.** I have a young student right now who has a name with not one but TWO apostrophes in it. I've been working with this kid for months now and not once have I ever heard a single targeted insult or tease his direction over his name. Kids simply learned his name, and went with it. He's not the only one with an overtly unique name in this pool of kids. All of the kids I work with now, in comparison to the last crowd I worked with, take the time and effort to learn a name properly and respect that. All the way down to the first and second graders. We do have girls with traditionally masculine names, and vice versa. I haven't heard a second of teasing over their names here. I haven't gotten any complaints from the kids of this happening when I'm not looking and believe me they will come sprinting to me if they feel the need over some very minor conflicts. **So if your concerns are genuine, take a look at the community this kid will grow up in to make a more grounded case for why this shouldn't be her name.**\n\n**If you truly can't live with your first name, there are legal processes to formally change it. I've done it.** It's often recommended for people who grow up in unhappy households because it helps alleviate the \"baggage\" that comes with hearing their own name. **If you think your name has caused you nothing but problems and there's not a single positive facet to find in the first name you were given, you can change it.** While I can't say I like the name your sister has chosen *at all*, the same avenue will be available for her own child. It's also wrong to take out your resentment on a set of people other than your parents for the name you were given and those who treated you poorly for it. You could have also come at this constructively in a way to \"protect\" the child, like suggesting that name become her middle name and she be given a first name that can help her \"mesh\" better with her peers. Instead, you blew up and insulted their overall ability to parent which will most likely cause them to double down in their decision making further. **The unfortunate reality is, no matter how right you are, if you're seeking to change a stubborn mind you have to approach that conversation calmly and constructively in order to make progress.**", "I\u2019m sorry you never got over your name, I suspect your future niece will, but experience similar problems. Thing is man, YTA, unfortunately even though you\u2019re looking out for her, you\u2019re not the parent.", "YTA\n\nIt's pretty obvious the name is pronounced Crystal.

I am a man who was given a woman's name at birth. A good example is naming your son Alice. It's not what my name was but it's close. My parents are hippies and gave their oldest son a girl's name to \"stick it to the man\" and  I will never forgive them for it. That name caused me to be bullied and damaged my professional life in ways I cannot describe. \n\nMy sister is pregnant with her first child. A girl. She and her husband are ecstatic, it just sucks that she inherited my parent's stupid propensity to see their children as fashion statements. Last night, she revealed to the family the name of her daughter.\n\nIt's Krxstxl. She wants to name her daughter Krxstxl. Confused, the name is pronounced Crystal. I already don't like that name but it's at least appropriate. I was not surprised to learn that my mom helped come up with the name.\n\nWhen she told me, I told her it was a terrible idea. If she wants to name her Crystal, name her Crystal. She tried to explain to me why the x's are there and I just told her it does not matter. She's naming a human, not a dog. I don't care what kind of fashion statement she's trying to make, this is a person who will have to live with that name until they die or has it changed. \n\nShe and my mom brushed me off as just complaining because I was never able to accept my name. I told my sister she was being either selfish, stupid, or an incredibly strong combination of the two if she thinks her daughter will want a stupid name like Krxstxl. We got into an argument and I told her I already see her and her husband as shitty parents for using their kid to be off-brand with her name and left right after. \n\nMy sister is not taking it well at all and my mom is furious with me. I'm starting to wonder if I was too harsh. I will not change my opinion on that incredibly stupid name. But I'm wondering if branding her as a shitty parent was too far.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
