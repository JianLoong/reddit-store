We were fortunate enough to be given some money to invite extra guests, so we decided to expand the wedding and have some of our second cousins and their kids, and some friends that we otherwise don\u2019t get to see as often.\n\nWe are on a budget, so we decided to keep the \u201cfancy\u201d cake (the cutting cake for the pictures, not the real cake) for immediate family and the pastor and a few members of the wedding party that we have known for the longest. We gave them the cake in boxes to take home though so they wouldn\u2019t be eating it in front of everyone else.\n\n(Minus the pastor because he flew out from a ways and he is vegan so he couldn\u2019t eat the dinner and we wanted him to have something to eat before it got too late.)\n\nWe got a couple sheet cakes. One was vanilla and buttercream with rosettes and then there was another sheet cake of pineapple chocolate chunk especially for Josh\u2019s side of the family (because they spend a lot of time in Florida).\n\nWe found out from talking with family that there was a lot of full slices left behind on people\u2019s plates of the pineapple cake. (Which the servers would not take home with them, so we noticed you can see it in a lot of the pictures.) We were having too much fun to notice at the time, we loved catching up with all our guests!\n\nApparently Josh\u2019s family did not like the cake like we thought they would and there have been some unkind words behind our backs. We got a text from Josh\u2019s uncle that wasn\u2019t meant for us to see and it really stung.\n\nWe are unsure where to go from here and what to say. The cake did not go off like we hope but we think they are being unnecessarily mean.\n\n(By the way, there was a full dinner, three kinds of cheese\u2014 even Monterey Jack\u2014 available, and an open bar that didn\u2019t close until late. So I feel like we were pretty good to our guests on a shoestring budget!)\n\nTLDR: we gave out two different flavors of cake at our wedding.

Plus the reasoning that you chose pineapple because of Florida sounds like a bs excuse to them because Florida is known for citrus - oranges, key limes - not pineapple.\n\nYes, people should be happy with whatever they get, sure.

That\u2019s all that matters", "I don't think the complaints were about you serving sheet cake - which is totally common at weddings - but rather about the flavor combination of chocolate and pineapple.  Feels like you made a random choice based on an bizzare assumption of what people eat in Florida (according to my husband who used to live in Florida,  chocolate pineapple is not a Florida thing) instead of asking the guests you were trying to cater to. And it sounds like you served the pineapple chocolate cake only to Josh's family instead of asking what they wanted.  \n\nYou're not the asshole for having two cakes but if you didn't give guests an option and then got upset when the cake you thought they wanted wasn't eaten,  then yes you're the asshole.\n\nEdit: From your comments,  it's clear that you decided who got which cake and expected them to trade plates if they weren't happy.  So, yeah, YTA", "YTA you didn\u2019t get a vegan meal for your pastor who flew a long distance to officiate. You openly distributed three cakes which very clearly were of different levels and chose who got what. You served one side of the family before the other.

Usually when there are multiple dessert options at a wedding people get to choose. You could have had the servers ask people what they wanted, or serve the cake from a buffet table. Granted, you would have run out of vanilla buttercream anyway because chocolate pineapple is such a strange flavor combination. The problem isn\u2019t your flavor choice as much as it is forcing it on half your guests. \n\nFamily sucks because they shouldn\u2019t have let their complaining get back to you though. \n\nAlso, not having a real meal for your pastor was shitty, caterers offer vegan options.", "YTA you fed your pastor non-vegan cake, managed to \u201cconfuse\u201d veg and vegan to the caterers, expect strangers to \u201ctrade cake\u201d if they didn\u2019t like what they were served, and for some reason assume people from Florida eat chocolate pineapple cake??\n\nLike, the cake is the least of your problems but it\u2019s still a super odd assumption to make?

I lived in Florida for almost a decade, and I can tell you with complete confidence that there is zero connotation between Florida and pineapples. I think you're confusing Florida with Hawaii.... lol. But beyond that, the combo of pineapple and chocolate just sounds yucky, and I think that's likely what people are speculating on. Honestly, I wouldn't sweat it. Everyone will forget about it shortly, I'm sure. What matters is if you enjoyed your wedding.", "Info- did you decide which cake each person would get chocolate pineapple or vanilla buttercream or did they get to pick which one they wanted?", "Okay I don't care about any of this but I'm so curious as to why you mentioned Monterey Jack by name line is some kind of fancy cheese and not something you can buy in any grocery store for like $5 \ud83d\ude02", "Pineapple chocolate sounds very weird and niche for cake. I'm sure the in laws thought it was something against them they got a very strange flavor ( that has nothing to do with Florida by the way) and your family was served first and got a normal safe flavor. Next time you host, make sure there's a vegan option for the vegan and enough safe flavors for everyone. Regular chocolate would have been better. You're probably going to get pineapple jokes for a very long time. When is Monterey Jack fancy? I can buy it for cheap at the grocery store. I think you need to do research before hosting again. People who do not know each other are not going to trade plates, especially if half the trade sounds and probably tastes weird.", "ESH.\n\nYoubased on the fact that you served one cake to one family and the other to his. Just slice them and set them out. Pjneapple chocolate is a an unusual and bold choice. It would have taken less effort to set all the options out for people to choose instead of sticking a whole side with what was prett clearly an unwelcome flavor.\n\nBut really this is petty shit and they need to move on. Its onr more wedding with meh food and lots of booze. Time to find a hobby if that's all you have to discuss after a few weeks.", "YTA.  Nothing wrong with 2 kinds of cake or even having the special cake for your wedding party. Giving your side one flavor first and then the groom's another later is just poor taste.

Why? \n\nI mean.... WHY?\n\nNTA, you can have whatever cake you want, but ... pineapple and chocolate.... why?!!!!", "I think The issue here is that people KNEW there were different cakes. Most places will keep the sheet cakes in the back so nobody knows that anybody\u2019s getting a \u201ccheaper\u201d cake. \n\nPineapple chocolate chunk also just sounds like a very specific kind of cake that wouldn\u2019t be liked by most. But if it\u2019s your favorite kind of cake then I guess have it? Every wedding I\u2019ve ever been to has had vanilla chocolate and maybe red velvet, but that\u2019s about it. I\n\n don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for trying to stretch your budget. I just think maybe it wasn\u2019t executed super well.

It sucks that your family is trash talking you behind your back, but wow you're a bad host. \n\nNo vegan meal for the pastor because you got vegetarian and vegan mixed up, but gave him a very not-vegan cake to make up for it?? Pineapple and chocolate?? Monterey Jack is fancy??\n\nI think I'd probably be trash talking right along with them.", "YTA. You can serve whatever flavors you want but you literally had people assigned flavors. Your family got to eat first and got a classic/normal cake. His family got fed second and got (I\u2019m sorry to say) a really weird cake. If you had made it an offering then sure, it would have just sat untouched. But you assigned cake. To say you expected them to trade cake with someone else is just weird. \n\nI honestly can\u2019t tell if this was the worst executed attempt to do something special or if that\u2019s the excuse you\u2019re using after realizing how differently you treated your family vs his.", "The REAL asshole here is whatever baker agreed to make a motherfucking pineapple chocolate cake because that sounds absolutely heinous \ud83d\udc80 \n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry but the cheese comment is hilarious, I can\u2019t even call you an ass because this is so surreal", "YTA for giving the best guests special cake in boxes and YTA for choosing cake flavors for your guests.", "I need to know what the text said.

Plenty of couples have wasted money on gross wedding cakes. You would not be the first.\n\nHowever, It is completely bizarre that you segregated the cake flavors. Weddings are about bringing two families together - not engaging in a cake apartheid. \n\nYou can expect this to be a standing joke for awhile.

Apparently she decided on chocolate pineapple for his family because they\u2019re from Florida and they\u2019re healthy eaters! She also emphasized how fabulous the buffet was because it included Monterey Jack cheese. This is either a troll post or she was dropped in her head as a baby.", "My best guess is that they felt like op did it on purpose to be petty or passive aggressive since all her family got a normal flavour and his family got the oddball choice.", "The problem is that most of the groom's family was served the weird cake and there wasn't enough common flavored dessert for everyone. And the OP didn't let them choose. Groom's family was served second with the lesser and dud dessert in favor of OP's family.", "If there were any poetry to the universe, they would be a really runny Camembert and Venezualan Beaver Cheese.", "I was thinking Kraft singles and some lovely slices of Velveeta.", "Can of American cheese flavor spray cheese not the fancy Sharp Cheddar kind.\n\nAnd Club crackers", "Ah yes, the famously successful ice breaker of begging strangers to trade cake\u2026.", "Who did you think was going to trade for  the pineapple chocolate?", "If there\u2019s a good cake and a weird cake, no one is going to trade.\n\nAlso your family was served first and would be finished before the crappy cake was passed out", "How could they have traded cakes (which is not a normal thing) when the vanilla cake was discreetly boxed up for your side to take home? They can't trade something they weren't supposed to see. Were they expected to ask people, hi can I trade my unusual cake for the one you are hiding?", "Hi there person I don't know but the bride wants me to mingle with, I have a piece of really awful cake here, yours doesn't look awful, do you want to trade cakes with me? I'll even give you a piece of plastic cheese to go with it!", "Part of the trouble with the meal is I accidentally said \u201cvegetarian\u201d instead of \u201cvegan\u201d to the caterers and we did not really realize until after the wedding we had criss-crossed the two. \n\nNothing that can be done about it now. I am unsure if I should let the pastor know now it may have had dairy.", "Came here to say something about the Monterey Jack. I wonder what the other two were: Kraft and Babybel?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Aussie here. Love pineapple lumps. Yummo", "Even then if OP really needed to put pineapple in cake she should have went with a vanilla cake with a pineapple filling or maybe a coconut cake, still not the most popular, but the pineapple chocolate chunk(?!) was certainly a choice.\n\n\nGonna take this opportunity to also say that canned pineapple chunks are disgusting.", "Marathon Key here, I assure you, you won't find any chocolate pineapple cake in the Keys", "What in the world? You basically forced Josh's side to have an odd flavor cake because of where they spend time and because they ear less and are health conscious? What is healthy about chocolate pineapple chunk cake? \n\nAlso, people do not generally trade cake slices and on top of that, very few people are going to trade their classic vanilla with buttercream for some weird cake creation. \n\nYTA for that. And for posting about the Monterey jack cheese as if it a delicacy.", "Okay yeah after reading that people didn't get to choose a flavor and that Josh's family got stuck with that crappy flavor choice without an option, I'm changing to YTA.  That was a TERRIBLE choice to begin with, but to make it not a choice and favor one family over the other is kind of a shitty move.", "So you gave your family all vanilla buttercream and then moved to his family and when the buttercream ran out they got chocolate pineapple.\n\nNTA for 2 cakes , AH for how it was distributed\u2026selecting your family first. \nWhy not do 2 sheet cakes the same flavor, especially since chocolate pineapple isn\u2019t a common flavor. \n\nAlso, I hope your were discreet with distributing special cake select people got to take home. Otherwise Josh\u2019s family that wasn\u2019t immediate saw boxes of cake going home to certain people and that there were 2 flavors of cake and they got served last.", "YTA for serving your family first, I\u2019ve never seen that happen at a wedding and it sounds super weird. Also even having a chocolate cake and a vanilla cake would be very questionable if people did not have a choice, but having a crappy garbage cake that 99% of people would never eat was extremely poor judgment", "I work wedding receptions almost every weekend. Almost every wedding cake has multiple flavors. We use a small cocktail tray and have a few slices of each flavor on the tray and then offer that to each table. Then each guest has the choice. \n\n Why wouldn't the servers just have small trays with both flavors available to be offered to each table?? \n\nOr even just have slices available on a table for guest to select for themselves??", "This is the weirdest logic I've ever heard.\n\nYTA", "I still don\u2019t think your an AH. Just a little misguided. But you didn\u2019t do anything offensive. You tried to make everybody happy. Things got messed up. Make a joke of it. Get a laugh telling stories about it for the years to come.", "If this was my wedding, great-great-grand relatives would be talking about it at my funeral, at 98.  And probably put a chocolate pineapple cupcake in my casket, lol.", "Are you from Florida?", "Pineapple and chocolate together is amazing -- if done well! If done poorly then anything can be terrible.\n\nHow about... vanilla layer cake, pineapple curd filling, with the cake masked in milk chocolate fudge frosting and topped with a brunoise of both fresh and caramelized pineapple compote...\n\nI should go make that cake.\n\n\n(source: I am a pro pastry chef)", "Uh, no.", "Lmao \u201cnot even Monterey Jack\u201d is absolutely going to be my new thing", "We went to a wedding like that. It was a dinnertime reception and it was extended family. They insisted we bring the kids. Invite said that food would be served. Turns out it was mostly a \"cake and punch\" reception (again, at dinner) with a few appetizers and I do mean a few. Enough for about 1/8 of the guests. \n\nWe left early, with hangry young children in tow and stopped at a drive thru. Throw chicken nuggets at most toddlers and they are happy. I felt bad for the other kids who had to stay and were visibly hangry and upset when we left.", "We went to a wedding about 10 years ago- church service started at 1030am. All good, had a light breakfast beforehand (didn't want to be too full and bloated for our nice clothes). Service was an hour and a bit. Reception venue about 15 mins drive from the church. Arrived there midday ish. Bride and groom were off doing photos. A cup of tea and a biscuit were served. We waited. And waited. And waited, not knowing what was going on, whether we should sort our own lunch or what. The meal was not served until 6pm. There was nearly a riot!!!", "I am fully convinced that no one cares about anything at a wedding or other party except how good or bad the food is (and maybe if there was no bar, an open bar, or a cash bar). For most events I've attended, I really can't remember the centerpieces or the party favors or any of that. But I do remember which ones had terrible food and which ones had amazing food. So if I were to advise a young person with a limited budget, I'd tell them to invest in good food, make sure there's enough of it, and try to pick a few \"plain\" options to satisfy the greatest number of guests possible.", "Man, you feasted!  The first wedding I went to, in Texas, we all went to a hotel ballroom to wait for the wedding party.  After an hour, the staff put out jugs of ice tea.  After 2 hours, enough cheese cubes for about a quarter of the group - I thought there was going to be fist fights over them.  After 2 1/2 hours of just sitting and staring, the bridal party finally showed.  20 minutes later, we were shown the door.", "That's not good.", "Came here to say this.", "That could possibly work if it were double fudge chocolate (a flavor \u2019many like!). But pineapple chocolate chunk?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Boxed display cake was different than the two sheet cakes people are", "You didn\u2019t make sure the cake was vegan before serving it?

YTA", "Oh, that's too bad.", "Easy there, Mr. Moneybags.", ">Even then if OP really needed to put pineapple in cake she should have went with a vanilla cake with a pineapple filling or maybe a coconut cake,\n\n \n\nPls, yall sleeping on pineapple upside down cake \ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude05", "Like having Monterey jack was supposed to forgive all", "Everyone was discreet expect the Pastor because we did not want him to feel like he needed to hide and eat his cake in a corner when we knew he had just been on a long plane ride.", "We didn\u2019t see it as a \u201ccrappy garbage cake\u201d, we thought it would make them feel special. Like a signature cocktail but in cake form.", "If OP is lucky, she\u2019ll only get some god awful cake forcefully served at her at every family event for the next 20 years \n\nYou spend a lot of time in Arizona! here\u2019s a prickly pair and mint cake!\n\nYou visit seattle a lot? Here\u2019s a coffee and IPA cake!\n\nYou live in the Midwest? Here\u2019s a funeral potato and ambrosia salad cake!\n\nYou summer in Maine? Here\u2019s a Lobster and blueberry cake!", "Now I\u2019m hungry", "I'm laughing at the thought of a cheese-based fist fight.", "And they were served after her entire side. So by the time they wanted to switch, likely anyone willing to trade would have partially eaten their cake.", "Pineapple chocolate cake is a waste of chocolate and pineapple.", "Lol", "Hey, if you get the Babybel at Costco, you can get two different kinds AND in the big bags. It's the one tip wedding planners HATE.", "Exactly! \n\nI would have gagged if someone served me a chocolate pineapple cake. I don't favor chocolate cake as it is but pineapple chunks in it would be a dealbreaker. I wouldn't be mad because I can live without dessert but I would be upset to see others being served a traditional cake flavor and look down to see the cake monstrosity on my plate. It would definitely be a \"Oh, we are less than\" moment. \n\nThere are plenty of tropical leaning cakes that don't mix these two flavors. Or just choosing a basic cake like chocolate with a berry or custard filling would have been great.", "Then you weren\u2019t discreet. It was very obvious and YTA.", "So you gave your immediate family and only a few members of the wedding party the fancy cake and asked them (minus the pastor) to hide it in a corner?  Maybe with their extra Monterey Jack?  Sorry, but I\u2019m just picturing this all in my head and laughing. Also, how did you get a caterer/bakery to actually bake a chocolate pineapple chunk cake?  Did you taste it before you chose it?", "Can you explain why you chose chocolate to be paired with pineapple??", "Then you should have picked a better cocktail. Chocolate and pineapple sounds disgusting. You would have been better off with one vanilla cake, and one chocolate cake, then let people take which ever they preferred.", "Did anybody on that side of the family ever say they liked chocolate pineapple?\n\nOr did you think \"They come from Florida! They must like chocolate pineapple!\"", "No offense, but that\u2019s a crappy cake most people wouldn\u2019t eat \n\nIt\u2019s like pepperoni pizza for one family and veggie for the other (it\u2019s actually worse than that )", "Then why didn\u2019t you eat that cake", "I didn't know what funeral potatoes or ambrosia salad were. The first one sounds pretty good. The second.. not so much, to me at least. But I'm always happy to learn about new foods!", "I\u2019m having trouble not reaching, TBH. And I like pineapple on pizza!", "Like at least choose vanilla or coconut lmao.", "It\u2019s like a good local place pepperoni for one side and frozen tombstone anchovy M&m for the other."]}
