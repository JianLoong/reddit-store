We were fortunate enough to be given some money to invite extra guests, so we decided to expand the wedding and have some of our second cousins and their kids, and some friends that we otherwise don\u2019t get to see as often.\n\nWe are on a budget, so we decided to keep the \u201cfancy\u201d cake (the cutting cake for the pictures, not the real cake) for immediate family and the pastor and a few members of the wedding party that we have known for the longest. We gave them the cake in boxes to take home though so they wouldn\u2019t be eating it in front of everyone else.\n\n(Minus the pastor because he flew out from a ways and he is vegan so he couldn\u2019t eat the dinner and we wanted him to have something to eat before it got too late.)\n\nWe got a couple sheet cakes. One was vanilla and buttercream with rosettes and then there was another sheet cake of pineapple chocolate chunk especially for Josh\u2019s side of the family (because they spend a lot of time in Florida).\n\nWe found out from talking with family that there was a lot of full slices left behind on people\u2019s plates of the pineapple cake. (Which the servers would not take home with them, so we noticed you can see it in a lot of the pictures.) We were having too much fun to notice at the time, we loved catching up with all our guests!\n\nApparently Josh\u2019s family did not like the cake like we thought they would and there have been some unkind words behind our backs. We got a text from Josh\u2019s uncle that wasn\u2019t meant for us to see and it really stung.\n\nWe are unsure where to go from here and what to say. The cake did not go off like we hope but we think they are being unnecessarily mean.\n\n(By the way, there was a full dinner, three kinds of cheese\u2014 even Monterey Jack\u2014 available, and an open bar that didn\u2019t close until late. So I feel like we were pretty good to our guests on a shoestring budget!)\n\nTLDR: we gave out two different flavors of cake at our wedding.

Plus the reasoning that you chose pineapple because of Florida sounds like a bs excuse to them because Florida is known for citrus - oranges, key limes - not pineapple.\n\nYes, people should be happy with whatever they get, sure.

That\u2019s all that matters", "I don't think the complaints were about you serving sheet cake - which is totally common at weddings - but rather about the flavor combination of chocolate and pineapple.  Feels like you made a random choice based on an bizzare assumption of what people eat in Florida (according to my husband who used to live in Florida,  chocolate pineapple is not a Florida thing) instead of asking the guests you were trying to cater to. And it sounds like you served the pineapple chocolate cake only to Josh's family instead of asking what they wanted.  \n\nYou're not the asshole for having two cakes but if you didn't give guests an option and then got upset when the cake you thought they wanted wasn't eaten,  then yes you're the asshole.\n\nEdit: From your comments,  it's clear that you decided who got which cake and expected them to trade plates if they weren't happy.  So, yeah, YTA", "YTA you didn\u2019t get a vegan meal for your pastor who flew a long distance to officiate. You openly distributed three cakes which very clearly were of different levels and chose who got what. You served one side of the family before the other.

Usually when there are multiple dessert options at a wedding people get to choose. You could have had the servers ask people what they wanted, or serve the cake from a buffet table. Granted, you would have run out of vanilla buttercream anyway because chocolate pineapple is such a strange flavor combination. The problem isn\u2019t your flavor choice as much as it is forcing it on half your guests. \n\nFamily sucks because they shouldn\u2019t have let their complaining get back to you though. \n\nAlso, not having a real meal for your pastor was shitty, caterers offer vegan options.", "YTA you fed your pastor non-vegan cake, managed to \u201cconfuse\u201d veg and vegan to the caterers, expect strangers to \u201ctrade cake\u201d if they didn\u2019t like what they were served, and for some reason assume people from Florida eat chocolate pineapple cake??\n\nLike, the cake is the least of your problems but it\u2019s still a super odd assumption to make?

I lived in Florida for almost a decade, and I can tell you with complete confidence that there is zero connotation between Florida and pineapples. I think you're confusing Florida with Hawaii.... lol. But beyond that, the combo of pineapple and chocolate just sounds yucky, and I think that's likely what people are speculating on. Honestly, I wouldn't sweat it. Everyone will forget about it shortly, I'm sure. What matters is if you enjoyed your wedding.", "Info- did you decide which cake each person would get chocolate pineapple or vanilla buttercream or did they get to pick which one they wanted?", "Okay I don't care about any of this but I'm so curious as to why you mentioned Monterey Jack by name line is some kind of fancy cheese and not something you can buy in any grocery store for like $5 \ud83d\ude02", "Pineapple chocolate sounds very weird and niche for cake. I'm sure the in laws thought it was something against them they got a very strange flavor ( that has nothing to do with Florida by the way) and your family was served first and got a normal safe flavor. Next time you host, make sure there's a vegan option for the vegan and enough safe flavors for everyone. Regular chocolate would have been better. You're probably going to get pineapple jokes for a very long time. When is Monterey Jack fancy? I can buy it for cheap at the grocery store. I think you need to do research before hosting again. People who do not know each other are not going to trade plates, especially if half the trade sounds and probably tastes weird.", "ESH.\n\nYou based on the fact that you served one cake to one family and the other to his. Just slice them and set them out. Pineapple chocolate is a an unusual and bold choice. It would have taken less effort to set all the options out for people to choose instead of sticking a whole side with what was pretty clearly an unwelcome flavor.\n\nBut really this is petty shit and they need to move on. Its one more wedding with meh food and lots of booze. Time to find a hobby if that's all you have to discuss after a few weeks.", "YTA.  Nothing wrong with 2 kinds of cake or even having the special cake for your wedding party. Giving your side one flavor first and then the groom's another later is just poor taste. They shouldn't have to trade to get what they'd prefer especially because the pineapple cake sounds awful.", "I don't think it's that you had two different flavors of cake, it's that you paired pineapple with chocolate. .... Why? \n\nI mean.... WHY?\n\nNTA, you can have whatever cake you want, but ... pineapple and chocolate.... why?!!!!", "I think The issue here is that people KNEW there were different cakes. Most places will keep the sheet cakes in the back so nobody knows that anybody\u2019s getting a \u201ccheaper\u201d cake. \n\nPineapple chocolate chunk also just sounds like a very specific kind of cake that wouldn\u2019t be liked by most. But if it\u2019s your favorite kind of cake then I guess have it? Every wedding I\u2019ve ever been to has had vanilla chocolate and maybe red velvet, but that\u2019s about it. I\n\n don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for trying to stretch your budget. I just think maybe it wasn\u2019t executed super well.

It sucks that your family is trash talking you behind your back, but wow you're a bad host. \n\nNo vegan meal for the pastor because you got vegetarian and vegan mixed up, but gave him a very not-vegan cake to make up for it?? Pineapple and chocolate?? Monterey Jack is fancy??\n\nI think I'd probably be trash talking right along with them.", "YTA. You can serve whatever flavors you want but you literally had people assigned flavors. Your family got to eat first and got a classic/normal cake. His family got fed second and got (I\u2019m sorry to say) a really weird cake. If you had made it an offering then sure, it would have just sat untouched. But you assigned cake. To say you expected them to trade cake with someone else is just weird. \n\nI honestly can\u2019t tell if this was the worst executed attempt to do something special or if that\u2019s the excuse you\u2019re using after realizing how differently you treated your family vs his.", "The REAL asshole here is whatever baker agreed to make a motherfucking pineapple chocolate cake because that sounds absolutely heinous \ud83d\udc80 \n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry but the cheese comment is hilarious, I can\u2019t even call you an ass because this is so surreal", "YTA for giving the best guests special cake in boxes and YTA for choosing cake flavors for your guests.", "I need to know what the text said.

Plenty of couples have wasted money on gross wedding cakes. You would not be the first.\n\nHowever, It is completely bizarre that you segregated the cake flavors. Weddings are about bringing two families together - not engaging in a cake apartheid. \n\nYou can expect this to be a standing joke for awhile.

Nothing wrong with cheddar but I wouldn't highlight \"we had cheese available\" as if it was anything special.", "It does remind me of The Solomon\u2019s from 3rd Rock. \ud83d\ude02", "EVEN Monterey Jack!  That cracked me up too.", "Yellow and White, so both kinds!", "Yeah, some commenters aren't being very considerate. Monterrey jack, Colby jack, cheddar cubes... Those seem like pretty common items for a wedding... They're not fancy, but people are usually pretty content to eat on them, and I thought she was just trying to illustrate that. Especially since the cake was experimental.", "That\u2019s what stood out to me the most. He traveled and they didn\u2019t even provide a meal for him that he could eat. I\u2019m assuming if you couldn\u2019t ask the caters to provide a vegan milk, she didn\u2019t provide a vegan cupcake or cake to him.", "I'm gonna tell you a little secret. You can buy a cake for no reason. No one at Costco will know you're going to eat it by yourself", "yeah my idea of a shoestring budget wedding is a fraction of that lol", "*uncakeable", "As a kid, Monterey Jack was one of the only cheeses I knew, because it came shredded in bags. I discovered Jarlsberg and ch\u00e8vre decades later. I now want my own cheese cellar.", "I grew up very food insecure and while I kinda get the vibe, I also get an innocent clueless type feeling as well.\nLike, I'm not even American and wouldn't associate pineapple with Florida. Also the vegan/vegetarian thing.", "Me too! I was like you didn't get your pastor a vegan meal? After he traveled??", "Ope!\n\nOshkosh native here, moved to CO in 1999 bc fuck the cold and dreary winters. But even still- I\u2019m missing out on what\u2019s so notable about Monterey Jack cheese. \ud83d\ude02", "Have some compassion for the child labourers working on cheese mines for your cheese greed.", "It\u2019s like bragging about serving a mild cheddar or something", "In Australia, \"tasty cheese\" refers to a moderately mature cheddar. I moved here as a kid from England and it confused me, at first, lol. You see it on packaging at supermarkets -- \"Bega Tasty Cheese\".\n\nWhile the cheese culture isn't as diverse here as it is in Europe, it's pretty good and you can buy all kinds of nice, specialty cheeses at certain supermarkets and independent grocers. We might be the arse end of the world, but even we'd be confused by someone praising a Monterey Jack as something special, haha.", "WHAT ARE YOU DOING", "Oh hell no you didn't just try to pull that  on a Wisconsinite!", "Hmm do you have a recipe for this nothing cake? I am curious and want to make it now", "Just because they're cats doesn't mean they get to live in sin! Mr Fluffles Whiskersworth *will* be marrying Lady Mittens D'Snootenboop, and that is that."]}
