We were fortunate enough to be given some money to invite extra guests, so we decided to expand the wedding and have some of our second cousins and their kids, and some friends that we otherwise don\u2019t get to see as often.\n\nWe are on a budget, so we decided to keep the \u201cfancy\u201d cake (the cutting cake for the pictures, not the real cake) for immediate family and the pastor and a few members of the wedding party that we have known for the longest. We gave them the cake in boxes to take home though so they wouldn\u2019t be eating it in front of everyone else.\n\n(Minus the pastor because he flew out from a ways and he is vegan so he couldn\u2019t eat the dinner and we wanted him to have something to eat before it got too late.)\n\nWe got a couple sheet cakes. One was vanilla and buttercream with rosettes and then there was another sheet cake of pineapple chocolate chunk especially for Josh\u2019s side of the family (because they spend a lot of time in Florida).\n\nWe found out from talking with family that there was a lot of full slices left behind on people\u2019s plates of the pineapple cake. (Which the servers would not take home with them, so we noticed you can see it in a lot of the pictures.) We were having too much fun to notice at the time, we loved catching up with all our guests!\n\nApparently Josh\u2019s family did not like the cake like we thought they would and there have been some unkind words behind our backs. We got a text from Josh\u2019s uncle that wasn\u2019t meant for us to see and it really stung.\n\nWe are unsure where to go from here and what to say. The cake did not go off like we hope but we think they are being unnecessarily mean.\n\n(By the way, there was a full dinner, three kinds of cheese\u2014 even Monterey Jack\u2014 available, and an open bar that didn\u2019t close until late. So I feel like we were pretty good to our guests on a shoestring budget!)\n\nTLDR: we gave out two different flavors of cake at our wedding.

Plus the reasoning that you chose pineapple because of Florida sounds like a bs excuse to them because Florida is known for citrus - oranges, key limes - not pineapple.\n\nYes, people should be happy with whatever they get, sure.

That\u2019s all that matters", "I don't think the complaints were about you serving sheet cake - which is totally common at weddings - but rather about the flavor combination of chocolate and pineapple.  Feels like you made a random choice based on an bizzare assumption of what people eat in Florida (according to my husband who used to live in Florida,  chocolate pineapple is not a Florida thing) instead of asking the guests you were trying to cater to. And it sounds like you served the pineapple chocolate cake only to Josh's family instead of asking what they wanted.  \n\nYou're not the asshole for having two cakes but if you didn't give guests an option and then got upset when the cake you thought they wanted wasn't eaten,  then yes you're the asshole.\n\nEdit: From your comments,  it's clear that you decided who got which cake and expected them to trade plates if they weren't happy.  So, yeah, YTA", "YTA you didn\u2019t get a vegan meal for your pastor who flew a long distance to officiate. You openly distributed three cakes which very clearly were of different levels and chose who got what. You served one side of the family before the other.

Usually when there are multiple dessert options at a wedding people get to choose. You could have had the servers ask people what they wanted, or serve the cake from a buffet table. Granted, you would have run out of vanilla buttercream anyway because chocolate pineapple is such a strange flavor combination. The problem isn\u2019t your flavor choice as much as it is forcing it on half your guests. \n\nFamily sucks because they shouldn\u2019t have let their complaining get back to you though. \n\nAlso, not having a real meal for your pastor was shitty, caterers offer vegan options.", "YTA you fed your pastor non-vegan cake, managed to \u201cconfuse\u201d veg and vegan to the caterers, expect strangers to \u201ctrade cake\u201d if they didn\u2019t like what they were served, and for some reason assume people from Florida eat chocolate pineapple cake??\n\nLike, the cake is the least of your problems but it\u2019s still a super odd assumption to make?

I lived in Florida for almost a decade, and I can tell you with complete confidence that there is zero connotation between Florida and pineapples. I think you're confusing Florida with Hawaii.... lol. But beyond that, the combo of pineapple and chocolate just sounds yucky, and I think that's likely what people are speculating on. Honestly, I wouldn't sweat it. Everyone will forget about it shortly, I'm sure. What matters is if you enjoyed your wedding.", "Info- did you decide which cake each person would get chocolate pineapple or vanilla buttercream or did they get to pick which one they wanted?", "Okay I don't care about any of this but I'm so curious as to why you mentioned Monterey Jack by name line is some kind of fancy cheese and not something you can buy in any grocery store for like $5 \ud83d\ude02", "Pineapple chocolate sounds very weird and niche for cake. I'm sure the in laws thought it was something against them they got a very strange flavor ( that has nothing to do with Florida by the way) and your family was served first and got a normal safe flavor. Next time you host, make sure there's a vegan option for the vegan and enough safe flavors for everyone. Regular chocolate would have been better. You're probably going to get pineapple jokes for a very long time. When is Monterey Jack fancy? I can buy it for cheap at the grocery store. I think you need to do research before hosting again. People who do not know each other are not going to trade plates, especially if half the trade sounds and probably tastes weird.", "ESH.\n\nYoubased on the fact that you served one cake to one family and the other to his.

Nothing wrong with 2 kinds of cake or even having the special cake for your wedding party. Giving your side one flavor first and then the groom's another later is just poor taste.

Why? \n\nI mean.... WHY?\n\nNTA, you can have whatever cake you want, but ... pineapple and chocolate.... why?!!!!", "I think The issue here is that people KNEW there were different cakes. Most places will keep the sheet cakes in the back so nobody knows that anybody\u2019s getting a \u201ccheaper\u201d cake. \n\nPineapple chocolate chunk also just sounds like a very specific kind of cake that wouldn\u2019t be liked by most. But if it\u2019s your favorite kind of cake then I guess have it? Every wedding I\u2019ve ever been to has had vanilla chocolate and maybe red velvet, but that\u2019s about it. I\n\n don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for trying to stretch your budget. I just think maybe it wasn\u2019t executed super well.

It sucks that your family is trash talking you behind your back, but wow you're a bad host. \n\nNo vegan meal for the pastor because you got vegetarian and vegan mixed up, but gave him a very not-vegan cake to make up for it?? Pineapple and chocolate?? Monterey Jack is fancy??\n\nI think I'd probably be trash talking right along with them.", "YTA. You can serve whatever flavors you want but you literally had people assigned flavors. Your family got to eat first and got a classic/normal cake. His family got fed second and got (I\u2019m sorry to say) a really weird cake. If you had made it an offering then sure, it would have just sat untouched. But you assigned cake. To say you expected them to trade cake with someone else is just weird. \n\nI honestly can\u2019t tell if this was the worst executed attempt to do something special or if that\u2019s the excuse you\u2019re using after realizing how differently you treated your family vs his.", "The REAL asshole here is whatever baker agreed to make a motherfucking pineapple chocolate cake because that sounds absolutely heinous \ud83d\udc80 \n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry but the cheese comment is hilarious, I can\u2019t even call you an ass because this is so surreal", "YTA for giving the best guests special cake in boxes and YTA for choosing cake flavors for your guests.", "I need to know what the text said.

Plenty of couples have wasted money on gross wedding cakes. You would not be the first.\n\nHowever, It is completely bizarre that you segregated the cake flavors. Weddings are about bringing two families together - not engaging in a cake apartheid. \n\nYou can expect this to be a standing joke for awhile.

In the grand scheme of things, is not a big deal, but you better be ready to forever be the weirdo with the gross cake to that side of the family.", "Nope. Having different cakes at a wedding isn't weird, but YTA for choosing a \"special\" flavor for just *his* family while serving *yours* a normal one & also for serving them BEFORE his family. It's tacky to begin with on *how* the order of serving went. Add that you also chose to give them a flavor that most would find disgusting & it just looks plain terrible on both of your parts. It's been years since my wedding & people still talk about the salad we served because they loved it. I can only imagine how long his family's going to bring up your \"signature\" cake because I'm sure it won't ever be forgotten. You only have yourself to blame, too, for not choosing a simple cake to serve everyone.", "You're not helping your case, chocolate pineapple ANYTHING sounds vile", "If it was meant to be a special signature cocktail type cake, how would they have decision paralysis?", "Please. Josh's family that got the special cake 100% told everyone else after you gave them that random and quite frankly disgusting sounding cake. They're talking about it.", "Why not provide a vegan meal for him then?", "\ud83d\ude02", "As an Australian I'm confused too! Isn't that a type of... um... tasty cheese? So curious to know the other cheese types! Also I've never heard of pineapple chocolate cake, despite having plenty of pineapples here.", "Oh god this is starting to feel like bananas up in your trolley if you are single and ready to mingle. Bananas down if you want people to piss off. (Or is it the other way around?)", "Tray bakes tend to be very shallow so the pineapple to cake ratio could be a bit off. I'd still eat it though because upside down cakes are awesome.", "If anything it probably has more sugar", "That poor man probably had the absolute worst flight home!!", "OP said he ate the meal, but OP chose to not tell him it wasn\u2019t vegan.", "Did the winner get the Monterey Jack?", "This is the real question", "Coffee and IPA cake sounds amazing", "\ud83d\ude02", "Well, you have your preferences, so at the least you have the pallet of a *discerning toddler* lol", "now i\u2019m imagining a pineapple chocolate cocktail\u2026 gag.", "Same & same!", "This cheese lampoon is better way better than the vapid cake drama.", "My fruit expertise starts and stops w pineapples unfortunately, so idk. Although actually when I was looking it up for reference apparently the cake is also some subtle swinger signal lol", "He wasn't provided a meal because she requested vegetarian instead of vegan so he couldn't eat it. So his meal was cake which likely had animal products in it anyway.", "Ambrosia salad is one of the best things on earth. There's lots of different recipes for it but I highly recommend you try making it one day.", "Yes I always eat my spray cheese in my fancy Elsa dress.\n\nIt deserves no less.", "Same! There are so many fruits that go well with chocolate, but pineapple isn't one of them at all!", "Pineapple on pizza is divisive enough, I dunno why did OP think pineapple with chocolate is a great combo. I'll only give a pass to pregnant mums cos they have the weirdest cravings. OP and her hubs just seem to lack the most basic social awareness if I'm being quite honest.", "This post is so weird. I love it.", "Facts", "r/brandnewsentence", "I'd like that on a t-shirt, thanks", "I came to see who else commented about the Monterey Jack line. What other cheese were offered that made Jack the \u201cstand out\u201d cheese lmao? Pre-packaged Kraft singles? Cheese wiz?", "Gold \ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd23", "OK, I'll try most foods at least once! It was just my first impression based on the ingredients.", "Strawberry and banana are two that come to my head first, but still not for forced wedding cake.", "I freely bequeath any claims to this copyright to all.", "Ikr, like you're trying to get them to leave and they think you want them to stay for more than dessert. I think I'm cancelling our baking experiment"]}
