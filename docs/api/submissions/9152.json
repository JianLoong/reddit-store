We are also in a split home situation with both our older kids (we each entered our marriage with a kid already), so I completely understand your reasoning.

We had to lay down some serious rules when we got her a vehicle, explaining to her that until she's 18 & can own the car, we are responsible for whatever happens with that vehicle & maintaining the value of it. However, if it would benefit your daughter in some way for her mom to financially contribute, find a way for it to happen that doesn't give her part ownership. Maybe she can give you the amount of the increase for car insurance for the next year or 2. Or she can contribute to the gas/maintenance expenses. Something so that she feels she has contributed & daughter can see you are both providing that need in some way. Apologize for potentially coming off abrasive.

Used cars are expensive even the basic cars. \n\nNot wanting your daughter to have to share or be a chauffeur is valid. But not wanting it to be a co parenting issue does make you a bit of the AH.
