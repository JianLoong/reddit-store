My husband agreed as this is his brother's son and he feels an obligation to help out.\n\nHe has been with us for 3 months now and things are coming to a head.  While we don't necessarily need him to pay us rent, I didn't expect to feel like I had an extra child in the house. I feel taken advantage of in my own home and do not enjoy being around him. \n\nWe have tried to address things subtly without success. For example, my husband asked him to join him at the grocery store and suggested he purchase some items for himself. He bought a few things but has not eaten any of them. Instead, he sits around playing video games/browsing social media waiting for us to cook for him and then eats way more than his share of the portions. He often only appears only once the food is on the table.  He also never eats while he is at university and instead comes home famished and raids our fridge/freezer.\n\nThis morning when I thought he was sleeping, I started telling my husband that we need to have a conversation with him to change the expectations going forward.  At 22, he should be contributing to his own living expenses and being more independent. He should not need to wait around for us to take care of him. For example, we can clear a shelf in the pantry/freezer for his foods so that way he can make his own meals when we are not home rather than waiting for us to return to cook for him.\n\nMy frustrations relate partly to the additional costs we are incurring by feeding an extra adult, but also because we are enabling inappropriate adult behaviors by not encouraging him to take care of himself more independently.\n\nI feel bad that he overheard me venting, but also don't because this is going to force a conversation that needs to happen.

Your husband should have stepped in a long time ago instead of trying to be subtle. This is a college kid. Most of us were really self-absorbed at that age. Let him know directly what the expectations are going forward. He can decide if he wants to follow them or move out.", "NTA. Are you also doing his laundry, washing his bedding, etc. No reason nephew can't also be doing some household chores.  Most definitely he needs to act like an adult and contribute.", "NTA - But whatever their age, most people who have only lived with their parents? They will likely not buy food, pick up after themselves or help with anything around the house, etc. They have always had their parents to act as servants, and they will expect their hosts and roommates to serve in their stead.", "NTA, He needs to learn to do things for himself or he will always expect others to do things for him, What income does the nephew get?, You and your husband need to talk and come up with a plan that works best for you both, If the nephew does not become more self sufficient then maybe its time he finds somewhere else, If hes not working then maybe get him to find a part time job and contribute in the house for things he uses, food/gas/electric/internet and anything else you may be paying for him to use.", "[deleted]", "NAH. No assholes **yet**.\n\nYou should have set some expectations and ground rules before he moved in. But I don't fault you for not predicting the problems, because you have never done this before. You assumed that he would act like a grownup and he assumed that you would be his substitute parents. \n\nBut now you need to set a new set of rules moving forward. The longer you wait, the harder it will be. Don't blow up at him like crazy. Remember this is partly your doing! He's not a mind reader and kids often assume things will be like they were when they were with their parents. He could become an asshole too if he simply refuses to change.\n\nThis feels like a delicate, potentially explosive situation. Good luck!", "YTA. He\u2019s not a mind reader. You guys clearly have all these expectations that were never communicated to him and then you\u2019re getting mad he didn\u2019t read your mind. \n\nYou need to lay out clear expectations and you should\u2019ve done this before moving a human being into your house.", "NTA", "NTA -  what part of 22 is hard to understand . either he\u2019s an adult or a child - if he\u2019s a child he can go mooch off his own parents and let them teach him manners,  if he\u2019s an adult he can act like one and be a considerate guest who pays their own way and does not cause extra cost and aggravation to the people nice enough to house him for free.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You sure can tell the other Gen Zs and their god damn entitlement by calling you guys assholes for not laying down expectations.  Bullshit, he is 22, he knows what needs to be done.\n\nI would first call the brother and explain this isn't working unless his entitled child doesn't change his ways.  That will get the ball rolling much faster than talking to the brat.", "NAH. This is definitely a frustrating situation, but it also sounds a little premature to fight about it yet or give an ultimatum. The behaviors he\u2019s exhibiting are juvenile and need to be rectified if he\u2019s going to continue living in your house, but he should also be given a clear set of expectations and a chance to change the behavior once he\u2019s been explicitly told what he is expected to be responsible for. He should at 22 know that this isn\u2019t acceptable, but nonetheless he may just need called out on it directly for a little reality check. If after you\u2019ve addressed it with him head-on the behaviors don\u2019t change, then it may be time for him to find other arrangements. But I would also make the responsibilities more clear ASAP and give him a chance to start stepping up. As far as him overhearing, if you genuinely didn\u2019t intend for him to hear and were just having what was supposed to be a private conversation with your husband about how to address the situation, then that\u2019s not really your fault, just unfortunate if it now makes things awkward. Good luck!", "YTA for the addressing subtly. You need to tell him directly - these are your chores, this is what you will be paying for, this is how you will behave or this is the door. Set expectations and hold him to them. Otherwise you are setting and he has no idea why.", "You all are (a tiny bit) the AH. First of all, as others have pointed out, there was a need from the beginning to have a conversation about how his stay would look like. Now, I would also assume that an adult would take responsibility for themselves, but I would still think it's important to give him a shelf, show him the laundry room and how to turn on the washing machine etc. because we all have different experiences and expectations. There is a need to state where the line is drawn, i.e. when he would get kicked out (e.g. no smoking indoors). This obviously shouldn't be stated in a threatening manner (unless he is incredibly rude) and should be agreed upon and stated from you both. \n\nAs he's an adult, he is an AH for relying on you to support him with the mindset of not helping out, especially since he is staying there rent free. Only coming out when it's time to eat, shows that he probably doesn't intend to help out with dishes or anything else. \n\nThe last thing that I would also mention is that there is still a chance to have a grown up conversation about this and could be a continuous one over his stay. Give him another tour of the house to show him his \"shelves/spaces\" within the house for him to use. You could do this by saying \"Hey Nephew, I have something to show you! We have organised some things for you\". And while you are at it, encourage him to ask questions, because that's a way for him to show he is beginning to take responsibility.", "ESH.  I get it being a last minute decision because he had nowhere to live.  That should have clued you in that you need to be clear in your expectations.  You should have had a conversation of how things would work.  You need to do that now.  And if he doesn't like it he'll need to make different living arrangements for next year.  (Or semester if he still has time to find somewhere else to live).  Bare minimum he needs to be paying for his groceries and his share of the utilities.  He also needs to be taking his turn cooking.", "NTA but didn't you set ground rules at the beginning?", "NTA, but stop pussyfooting around him by doing things like taking him to a grocery store and suggesting he buy food.  Sit down with him and tell him he has to start being responsible for himself.  He can get his own dinner during week and eat with you on weekends for example.  He should also keep his room clean, and if he's not paying rent, he ought to be doing things like cutting the lawn, shoveling snow, etc.", "My 22-year-old son lives in a house with others in a very HCOL area; pays rent that is almost as much as my home mortgage, works a full time job, is in online school full-time, and does multiple acting and commercial auditions every week. HOWEVER, when he was home, he was a slug. Room was a mess, messed up the house, didn't do dishes, and so on. It was a difference between adulting on his own, and taking advantage of his folks while at home. His bad habits needed to be disrupted, and now he is adulting fabulously.\n\nYour nephew is entitledly treating your house like his own instead of treating it like he is a responsible adult guest. He needs to be informed that he is a GUEST and as such, he is not entitled to anything; there are certain expectations tied to the fact that he gets a free place to stay. Then offer him a list of these expectation. If he chooses not to fulfill them, then he can find a new place to stay. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, and what I would do is to yell both at my nephew and my BIL, this last to check what has exactly been told to nephew about his living rules (example, if they're giving him money for rent or not etc)", "The short answer is no. It was a last minute request because he had no where to live so we agreed.  We did let him know there is a grocery store within walking distance where he could grab some items for himself, but we never explicitly said that he should make his own meals with his own groceries when we aren't home.", "My husband and I talked about encouraging him to get a job.... we aren't sure this is really our responsibility given he's not our child but I'm going to think about it some more.  Certainly if this were my child and he was lazing around a significant amount of time, I would want him working and contributing.", "Right? I never expect to feed myself when I'm staying with someone for months/years. What's next? Will they demand the nephew take showers and clean up after himself? Maybe even wash his clothes? Madness.", "So you think that it is entirely normal for a 22 year old to expect to be treated as OP's teenage child with no responsibilities to offset costs or at least ask how they can contribute? You think that this is entirely on the OP because she has the audacity to expect an adult would behave like a considerate guest? He did not spell out his expectations for her in as many words, so why aren't you faulting him for behaving like an utter mooch?", "Thank you. This articulates very well how I am feeling. I genuinely didn't expect certain things needed to be stated at the beginning because I thought by fourth year university he would be acting like more of a grown up.  Given where we are now, we need to address it directly to give him a chance to step up more.", "Yes. \n\nOP is disgruntled because the Nephew is failing to meet the expectations that were never set.", "Okay, I get how that happened. I\u2019m going  with YTA because you\u2019re getting mad at him for not doing things you never said you expected him to do. He probably thought it was going to be just like living at his parents\u2019 house where he just ate what was in the fridge. \n\nI would have a calm conversation with him where you spell out, clearly, what you expect of him while he stays with you. Then if he still doesn\u2019t comply, kick him out.", "under your roof you need to have boundaries for him to follow while living with you, him having a job might help you and your husband and kids have that more alone family time.", "He's 22 but you seem to think OP typed 12.", "Nope, I saw how old the nephew was.", "For some bizarre reason I'd think a grown adult should be grateful for living rent free in a home that's not his parents, instead of acting like a child. That's just me personally though \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I agree that he SHOULD be doing more. It sounds like he went straight from his parents\u2019 house to his aunt and uncle\u2019s house, though. Since no one sat him down and explained what the different expectations were, I can see why he would have thought the rules about food were the same as at his parents\u2019 house.", "Igwym. Though, he should be perfectly capable of understanding that it's **not** his parent's house. It's common sense that if you're staying somewhere that's not home, you don't eat all their food, and if you're there for an extended period of time, you pitch in. That's just human decency. Hopefully OP sitting down and talking to nephew will resolve the problem."]}
