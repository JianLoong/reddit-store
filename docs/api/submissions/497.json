So during lockdown my husband and I were looking for  a project to keep us busy and we saw a local auction coming up for a flat. We decided to go along as why not. We ended up winning a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom flat which was in horrible condition for \u00a37000. We spent all of lockdown renovating it together and more than once we nearly gave up and cut our losses as it was a nightmare but we recently completed it and I love it.\n\nDuring the tail end of lockdown I also fell pregnant with our first child and we now have a daughter. We decided it'd be a good idea with how things worked out for the flat to be hers. We'll rent it out until she's 18 all the money going into a trust fund for her to help towards her future and if she's not quite ready to leave the nest as soon as she turns 18 that's all good it can continue to be rented out for her. I know some of you will wonder what if we have future kids and how that's not fair but that's not going to happen. The birth was so bad that on my Doctors recommendation I had my tubes tied so there will be no future children who could feel left out. \n\nOur family of course know of this project we've been working on and that we're planning to rent it out soon and my Aunt reached out two days ago asking us to rent it to my 20 year old cousin as he's looking for his own place. I have hesitation over this as renting to family seems like it could be messy as they may feel they can be more lax about the rent or get too comfortable and not want to leave when she's older and may want it herself. I talked it over with my husband and he agreed he'd rather it go to someone who isn't family. I didn't want to be rude so didn't voice these exact concerns to my Aunt and cousin I just said we already had some potential renters lined up which is a white lie but I felt it better than laying out my concerns as they'd get offended and deny this. \n\nMy Aunt is upset over this thinking i'm being \"spoiled\" and not sharing my good fortune with the family and how I should put family above strangers. She has even tried to get my parents to convince me to rent to my cousin as if i'm a little child they can tell what to do which is laughable. I do feel sorry for my cousin but this isn't just a property I want to rent out to bring in a little cash but an investment for my daughters future. Am I perhaps being too harsh though? I don't want to cause further friction but i just feel renting to family is a bad idea.", "created_utc": 1667095563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yh1vb0/aita_for_refusing_to_rent_my_daughters_flat_to_my/", "score": 402, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They've never been anything but respectful, and if anything we have a stronger relationship than before.\n\n\nThere's no way I'd consider renting to them in OP'S situation because of the complete disdain for their boundaries the aunt is showing.", "That\u2019s terrible! I\u2019m sorry that happened to you.", "and you just *know* \"family rate\" will soon turn into \"why should we pay you when we're family?\"", "EXACTLY!!", "Good point. Why do they want YOUR flat?", "That\u2019s not an if, that\u2019s a when.", "No I didn't miss a 0, it was basically derelict and in an auction. No one else really wanted to take the chance on it. We had to rip it apart and replace everything.", "Does \"flat\" mean an apartment or a free-standing house?  Just trying to picture it.\n\nBTW good job on investing for your daughter's future and NTA. :-)", "Around here you can get a home that cheap. Not in good condition. My home was 27K, my sibling bought a 15k home, and the two story three bedroom home down the street from me sold for 20K. They are out there but if it's less then 15K the house probably needs a complete renovation", "When you decide to have a management company to deal with the property, you count on the fact that these people get the hint. The problem is, they will just go straight to the point and tell you to deal with them directly because you are family.", "\ud83d\ude25", "By this I mean it's not a side hustle where the money is going to me and my husband which is just extra income.

There's likely a local landlord association that has sample leases and can help get you set up on doing this legally, as well as your obligations to your tenant.", "Was it structurally sound?", "In the UK a flat is an apartment, ie one unit stacked with others. Sometimes purpose-built as a block of flats, sometimes a larger house that has been carved up into fully separate units.", "No worries at all, it's a small town so property values are funky here already at the best of times. I'm glad I could help you understand", "It will be leasehold - so you don\u2019t own the land. If there aren\u2019t many years left on the land lease then it will be cheap.", "For sure, and congrats to you on a good deal."]}
