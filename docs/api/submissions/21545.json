She's caused a few arguments between us, some due to my own insecurities (like me finding out he was still seeing her much more recently than he initially told me), and some because of the lack of respect he shows me when it comes to her (like going behind my back to speak to her).\n\nI (21F) have stuck by him because he's explained that he's reluctant to cut ties or set stricter boundaries with her due to her poor mental health.\n\nRecently, she called him because she was feeling extremely depressed. She ended up going over to his house, where I had been staying, and he kicked me out because of how urgent it was. They went to A&E, and although I was initially upset about how emotionally dependent she was on my boyfriend, I supported him through it.\n\nAll I asked was to be kept in the loop and tackle it as a team, rather than feeling like an outsider in my own relationship. \n\nAfter her A&E trip, she went back home but decided to stay with him instead. I asked where she'd be sleeping and he said his bed. I asked if this meant that he'd be sleeping on the couch, and he said that he just wanted to sleep and he was too tired to have this conversation.\n\nI pleaded with him to sleep on the couch, because the whole situation was hard for me, but this small gesture would be very reassuring. He refused, and said I was being irrational, when he just wanted to be comfortable, even though he was sleeping on a pile of shirts while there were plenty of pillows on the couch.\n\nI'm upset that he couldn't understand why I was hurt by this.

But this is going even beyond that. Kicks you out of the house? Sleeps in the same bed as her and tells you off about it because you need a small amount of reassurance? What you've asked is super reasonable. You're hurt by it because he's replaced you. Maybe not intentionally, maybe he doesn't even realize it. Young people can be pretty stupid after all.

It\u2019s fine that he\u2019s being supportive of a friend. But the issue is he\u2019s disrespecting you to do it. If the tiles were reversed I bet he would t be on with it. I bet YOU wouldn\u2019t be ok with it. If it was your ex and still friend going through these things , how would you go about helping them while showing respect to your partner. Your not making him choose, he\u2019s choosing. He chose and continues to choose her. You are not a priority. He might care for you but he loves her. Maybe he\u2019s my still with her bc of her issues and your a good gf who he can control so this way he can have both.  Love yourself more, respect yourself more. I\u2019d break up with him or ask for time apart. How he acts during this time is important, be dispassionate on how you view things from here on. Love can be great when it involves respect , without it- it\u2019s very painful. He will probably try to blame you for making him choose, he will say you don\u2019t trust him him, he will say she\u2019s going through a very difficult time and your being immature and selfish. If he does at any point do this: just say ; ya know you might be right. I\u2019m selfish enough to want my boyfriend to not be involved so intimately with his an ex girlfriend. I\u2019m selfish enough to want a man to put my emotions and feeling and needs before another woman whoever she is. So it appears we\u2019re incompatible and it looks like there\u2019s no point in continuing g this cycle. He can look for a naive girl who\u2019ll put up with that relationship or get back with the ex. And you can look for someone who can value, respect and love you. Good luck ! \n\n(Break up!!!!! Fingers crossed)", "INFO: Have you always been this gullible or has he made you like this?\n\nHonestly girl, NTA, but you need to straighten that crown \ud83d\udc51 of yours and walk the hell away!
