My older sister has always borrow my things which only started becoming an issue when I noticed she would take care of her clothes and shoes that she wore, but when I came to wearing my stuff after a few wears they would be damaged. I have had to throw away a couple shoes because of this. \n\nIn the past when she would wear something of mine a lot of times, I just gave it to her as I rarely got to wear them because of her. I then noticed that the moment I gave it to her, I\u2019ve never seen her wear it. \nShe rarely wears her own clothes and shoes, always wearing mine. \n\nShe recently started wear a pair of pastel trainers (sneaker) that was hard for me to find for a good price and I allowed her to wear it until I saw a small crease. At this point she has worn the trainers a lot more times than I have. I decided to hide it in a shoe box and kept it as the back of my closet. She asked where it is and I told her I sold it. I felt bad about lying but it had to be done. Even though I got the shoes for a good price, they were still expensive. \n\nAnother scenario is a silk baseball cap. As a black woman with 4c hair, this silk cap is is perfect for my hair and I don\u2019t have to worry about it damaging it. A literally holy grail find! She discovered it and wears it all the time! To the point that once again, she has worn it more than me! The other items, when she wears it, she asks beforehand or let\u2019s say she wants to wear my jacket, she\u2019ll put it on then ask if she can wear it before she goes out. However, with my cap, she has stopped asking to wear it and sometimes when I\u2019m about to head out of the house, I notice it\u2019s gone and see her with it on. Like she owns it. \n\nFor me personally, if I borrow something a few times and really like it, I buy it myself. She earns a lot more money than me so I know money isn\u2019t the issue for her to buying things she really wants. \n\nI am now contemplating hiding the hat as well.

It's nice to be able to borrow each others things while first asking, taking good care of the item, and returning it promptly after it use, but that isn't being done.  You are under no obligation to share your items, particularly items you've bought yourself.  I'd explain the situation to your parent(s), let your sister know she's no longer welcome to borrow your items and get a lock for your door.", "NTA but it\u2019s unclear if you\u2019ve ever actually spoken to her about this. If you haven\u2019t, you should start", "NTA, but I'm also wondering if OP ever talked to the sister about this."]}
