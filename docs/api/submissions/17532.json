My best friend who I met about 7 months ago recently went through something very traumatic with a boyfriend that abused her. Her boyfriend went to jail and the place where she was living had a roommate that began to be very emotionally abusive to her. I wanted to be a good friend so I told her she could come stay with me for about a month until she was able to save up for her own apartment in my complex. So she came to stay with me and I told my boyfriend about it. This is where I feel I might be TA. He says I just made a decision on my own without considering his feelings or his daughter's or even giving him a chance to discuss this with me, but I knew if I had discussed it with him, he would have said it's a bad idea because he doesn't like her and I didn't want him to talk me out of it because I felt like I was doing the right thing.

While it's important to consider your boyfriend's feelings, he does not have the final say in this matter since you don't live together.

Have you met the old roommate?
