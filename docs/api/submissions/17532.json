I find that when someone is continually \"abused\" by everyone around them... they are actually often the narcissist in the situation. Not saying your best friend is one, just be cautious about who you let into your heart and home... there are a lot of people out there who live on drama and will make you regret it. \n\nNow the boyfriend, you've known him 8 months, and he does not live with you? He has no rights over your home nor income. You did not owe it to him to discuss anything with him and this is another red flag. So, while I sort of agree with him about this move I'm afraid he has no rights here. \n\nPlease know this from someone twice your age who has lived through some crap... this \"best friend\" could be trouble. Narcissistic people are drawn to empathic people, they feed off of your energy and this could be a huge mistake. Take this free advice for what it is.", "NTA, this is your life and your living situation. \n\nIt's a concern that he thinks you should discuss all your decisions with him first, even though you're not at a stage in your relationship where that would be appropriate. Why is he bringing his daughter into it?", "personally, i wouldn't have her move in simply bc you've only known here a little over half a year and you haven't had time to really see how she moves. that being said, you're NTA for making a decision about your own home.", "NAH", "NTA whatsoever. You just wanted to help your friend through an extremely tough and traumatic experience. Your boyfriend should at least try to be more understanding of that. Also, why is he so upset?

What about your family?\n\nThe age gap between the two of you is a potential red flag, and his behavior here is several very bright red flags.\n\nIf his objection were that you have not known this friend long enough to trust her as a roommate, that would be one thing -- but that's not his objection.\n\nHe's mad that you didn't ask for his *permission*, about something that does not concern him AT ALL.\n\nHe doesn't like the person you call your best friend and he's trying to make you think your friend is \"flaky\", and probably criticizes other things about her... which sounds like he's trying to isolate you from your friends, which is textbook abuser 101.\n\nYou say you've only known this friend for seven months but you call her your best friend (which is totally valid -- sometimes you just click with someone right away).\n\nDid you have other friends or another best friend but something happened and you stopped being friends? And if so, was your boyfriend involved, directly or indirectly, in whatever happened that ended the friendship?", ">He comes to see me on the weekends sometimes with his daughter\n\nDoes he come over without his daughter? \n\nIf he doesn't want his daughter around your roommate, why can't you go visit him at his place on this weekends (instead of making your roommate pay for a hotel for an entire weekend, especially when she's trying to save money so she can get her own place)?"]}
