I find that when someone is continually \"abused\" by everyone around them... they are actually often the narcissist in the situation.

He has no rights over your home nor income. You did not owe it to him to discuss anything with him and this is another red flag. So, while I sort of agree with him about this move I'm afraid he has no rights here. \n\nPlease know this from someone twice your age who has lived through some crap... this \"best friend\" could be trouble.
