We have a custody agreement and I pay child support. I've never had any issues with it. I pay on time. I want my daughter to have a good life wherever she is so if the mom asks for money, I'll send extra as well .We've never had issues with that. We have a pretty friendly relationship and we don't argue. We'll be connected in someway forever so we keep it cordial. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI make good money but I'm no millionaire or anything like that. But my daughter stays with me so I have things that she'd like here. I have games and a pool. I don't really care for swimming but she enjoys being in a pool. I don't do anything ridiculous like buy her a pony or make large purchases without consulting her mother. But we go to fun events and I've taken her to Disneyland. I've taken her to see animals. Disneyland was probably the most expensive and big thing but that isn't common. I just listen to what she says and do things she enjoys. We make sure that she can't get away with things here or behave less disciplined depending on what house she is at. She has to be in bed at a certain time, do school work, chores etc. Punishment and rewards are the same no matter where she is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer mother has been serious with this guy. They seem to argue a lot and yell at each other. I haven't seen it this is just from what my daughter told me. That is one reason she enjoys being at my house because even if they aren't yelling at each other if they are upset there will be tense energy between them. Also they never seem to take what she wants into consideration. This is a problem that I faced when I was with her mother. If we're driving home and want to stop to get some quick food. She'd never take what our daughter wanted to eat into consideration. I'd always tell her that not every time she has to \"win\" but sometimes just deal with eating at place you don't like for her. Our daughter hardly asks for anything, she's not one of those kids. So the rare times she asks to go out and get a milkshake, I go out and get a milkshake. Her mother says she doesn't like being at her house and that I am spoiling her. She keeps bringing up how I took her to Disneyland one time like I do that every week or something. I don't think taking your kid to a zoo every now and then is spoiling.  I asked her if our daughter has said this ever but i guess she can just tell that she'd rather be at my house. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur daughter has always been a quiet kid and her mother knows this. So it's not hard to just listen to what she says. When she is really interested in something she'll speak up about it. If her mentioning she has been watching videos of people drawing things and then later buying her some paper and drawing materials is spoiling, then sure, I'm spoiling her.", "created_utc": 1673567307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10aeven/aita_for_spoiling_our_daughter_and_making_her/", "score": 360, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Once she builds a rapport with her therapist, she might speak more freely about what, if anything, is bothering her. Even though you're her dad, she might feel guilty if she talks too harshly about her mom/the new BF to you because she loves her mom too, and won't want to be talking badly about her.", "NTA if spoiling is spending time, you're spoiling her ... and good for you for doing it! If she prefers one parent / house to another, that's her prerogative. Everyone is allowed to have their likes and dislikes.

If it were me, I'd continue checking in with your daughter about it because it may escalate and/or continue to impact her more and more.", "NTA! Can you be my dad? ;)", "NTA. You\u2019re a really good dad!", "NTA. You're not spoiling your daughter by supporting her interests, asking for her opinion on things that impact her - like what food she wants to eat, and doing special activities that kids enjoy. You're ex is making it a contest (which she's losing) and you're just being a parent.", "NTA From what you describe it does not sound as if you are spoiling your daughter. You expect her to follow the rules, do chores, etc. \n\nAs for preferring to be at your house... where would any of us prefer to be in a house where the adults scream at each and there is never ending tension or a house where the atmosphere is quiet and predictable?", "NTA . At this point I'd consider moving her in with you if that's what she wants . Arguing is draining whether you are the one yelling or having to hear it . \nHer mother sounds bitter broke and jealous .\n If mother is mad that your daughter gets to experience joy , shouldn't be living with her imo\n\nOr try for custody if it isn't doable rn because of court reasons", "NTA. Paying attention to and spending time with your child is not spoiling her. Mom needs to step it up and quit her arguing in front of the kid. Don't pull back on the way you are raising your daughter  because the mom can't help but be miserable..", "NTA\n\nThere is a difference between providing a wonder life experience to your children and spoiling them. Spoiled kids turn rotten. If you kind is still kind, respectful, and an overall good human your doing a good job.", "NTA. You have fun with your daughter on your time. She doesn\u2019t sound spoiled at all. I do all those things with my kids and they\u2019re not spoiled. I would probably without judgment bring up that your kid is affected by the fighting at their house. Just say, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you had an argument in front of her or whatever, I get it, just wanted to let you know she was a little upset.\u201d It seems self explanatory obviously but maybe she needs a gentle nudge about keeping their disagreements away from your daughter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't think what you've laid out is unreasonable or spoiling, my daughters are similar and I take a similar approach. NTA", "NTA . You\u2019re being a father and a damn good one at that. Listening to her and obliging on things she has earned or deserved it great. I was a quiet kid and got in trouble for asking for things. That stuff still sticks with me to today. Don\u2019t change anything. Your daughters your number 1 and her mom needs to step up.", "You're NTA. You sound like a great dad.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you are doing exactly what a good dad should be doing.", "NTA - Is the mom struggling financially? The Disney trip in particular seems to rankle her and that's an expensive, once in a lifetime experience for most people. Maybe she's irked that she wasn't the one to give your daughter those memories. Something that I've noticed with divorced or separated parents is that the parent with the day-to-day custody always feels inferior to the parent who swoops in for a weekend packed with fun stuff.\n\nRegardless of your ex's feelings on your visitation activities, your daughter is the priority. It's worth having a sit down with the ex and talking about the atmosphere at home and how you're concerned for your daughter. If your daughter is exceptionally unhappy, it might be tie to revisit the custody agreement.", "NTA\nYou are taking your daughter\u2019s wishes into consideration when making a decision, wishes it sounds like she doesn\u2019t make often. You are still co-parenting (punishments and rewards being the same both places) effectively and are being an attentive and dedicated parent. \nYour ex\u2019s new relationship seems to have a lot of issues and as such there is tension in that household - tension your daughter has picked up on and doesn\u2019t appreciate. If your ex wants to see your daughter happier while at her house there are steps she needs to take to see that happen and it\u2019s not on you to fix her relationships.", "Honestly sounds like you are the dad I wish I had!", "NTA, You\u2019re investing in your daughters interests and showing that she\u2019s loved even with little gestures like a milkshake. It seems as though she\u2019s grateful that you\u2019re paying attention to her and giving her the validation that a child so dearly needs from a parental figure in their life. Ex is definitely jealous that she\u2019s facing the consequences of ignoring your daughter. I would assume the arguing is all a reason why she prefers your home over the ex, ex fails to reflect on herself and is looking for a scapegoat for her insecurities. You are not a bad father for showing your daughter affection, even if it is in the form of gifts.", "NTA it is mom, or more likeley the boyfriends behavior that is making her want to spend more time away from moms place", "NTA. Be sure to keep an eye on the situation with that guy her mom is seeing. That could be causing more issues for your daughter and part of what's motivating your ex to react against her preference for you.", "NTA. Your daughter prefers your house, not just for the extras, but because there is a peaceful environment. Unfortunately, that is something the ex will never understand.", "NTA. You are a good dad.  \n\nIt's sad that treating a child like a normal human being can be considered spoiling them.", "NTA your ex needs to look a little bit closer for why your daughter prefers staying with you.", "NTA", "I was ready. I was so ready to call you our, but I can\u2019t. You are definitely NTA. You sound like a great dad. Your daughter is lucky to have you. Your ex better get her act together, because as the mother of two adult daughters the teenage years are rough on that relationship. If she\u2019s not listening to her and taking her wants into consideration now it\u2019s going to get ugly for her in few years, you\u2019re going to swoop in and be the hero with milkshakes for your daughter and your ex will really get on you then.", "NTA.  It sounds like things were amicable after the split, but the balance has been thrown off since the new boyfriend has become a factor.  You can\u2019t control your ex\u2019s love life, but I don\u2019t think you can completely wash your hands of it either.\n\nIt sounds like your ex is deflecting.  If your daughter doesn\u2019t like being at her house, it must be because you are spoiling her.  The reality is pretty obvious that her boyfriend and their relationship is the root of the problem.  I\u2019m sure your daughter picks up on any new tension between her parents, which isn\u2019t your fault.\n\nNot sure how receptive your ex would be to family therapy, but I think that would be beneficial.  It would be an uphill battle trying to convince your ex to consider how her boyfriend is contributing to the problem.  You really need an unbiased third party to address the dynamics of the adult relationships and the effect it is having on your daughter.  Good luck.", "NTA. I love pools and ponies. What time's dinner?? \ud83d\ude09", "Nta. Sounds like your wife is more focused on her toxic relationship than her child, and kids pick up on that kind of thing. Keep being a great dad.", "Nta.

You are being a parent.", "She prefers dad because dad gives her something mom doesn\u2019t, love.", "I hope that dad advocates for his daughter even better and gets primary custody of his daughter wants it.

Absolutely NTA.", "Nta... you're a fantastic dad. Wait until she's 12... get custody. Your daughter deserves more", "NTA\n\nThis doesn't sound like spoiling. It sounds like you are giving your daughter a way to enjoy herself and not think about what she has to return home to.", "I'd like to clear up that this COULD be a n a h situation; sometimes one split parent is just in a better situation to \"spoil\" the kid (read: afford to let them do things) and it's just the unfortunate way the cookie crumbles. Parenting is hard, and not every parent who struggles to keep up with their kids wants is inattentive.\n\nIt sure sounds like your wife is, though, and she wants you to stop giving your daughter what she wants not to help the two of them bond but to stop highlighting that she won't bond with her daughter. NTA.", "NTA. Keep being a good Dad and putting your daughter first, and most importantly, listening to her. As long as you are not actively bad mouthing the mom to your daughter, then the Mom is making her own bed there. Your daughter will make her own choices.", "You seem like a great dad. It also seems like she prefers your house not because of your bank account but rather the environment and tense atmosphere at her mother's. She seems to have been fine with the schedule before the moms boyfriend came into the picture. The older she gets, the more resentful she is going to get about her mother not respecting her wants, needs and interests. I wouldn't be surprised if she wants to move in with you full time and would look into contacting  a lawyer about getting primary care or full custody. I wouldn't pay attention to what your ex is saying. I think it's coming from the fact that she can't provide the same way you can and that's not your fault. As well as a place of jealousy about your relationship with your daughter. Keep doing what your doing, it's working.", "NTA You aren't spoiling her. You're doing a thing called good parenting. You give her attention and show that you listen to her. You make her feel welcomed and loved. You're a good dad, be proud of that.", "it sounds like the problem has more to do with what\u2019s going on at your ex wife\u2019s house than what\u2019s going on at your house. if your daughter is saying that she doesn\u2019t want to be there because of the fighting, maybe you should encourage her to speak up or tell your ex to talk to your daughter. sounds like nta and mostly excellent coparenting even", "You remind me of how my dad treated me when I lived with my mother.

He protected me as much as he could from the bad situation at my mom\u2019s. Eventually I got old enough to decide to move in with him full time.

It\u2019s really because it is so damn uncomfortable in your ex\u2019s household. \n\nPoor kid.", "NTA, it sounds more like jealousy on your exs part. your daughter enjoys spending time with you more than she does her because she's not put on the backburner with you and gets some peace and quiet at your house.", "NTA, you need to be documenting this stuff. Her mom is at least being less than kind and at worse allowing your daughter to be exposed to a hostile and angry relationship between her and this guy!", "NTA... you have precious little time before she is too busy to do things with her. Enjoy this time. Build memories.  You will need this to get through the tougher years", "I do want to say your an ah for not buying her a pony! But really, NTA", "Don't forget she also doesn't have to listen to a scream fest either at her dad's.", "NTA. You are being an awesome parent. Keep it up and keep placing your daughter first. \n\nI would also recommend that you start documenting everything you can related to your ex's household that is affecting your daughter. Also keep a very, very close eye on what is going on there. Hopefully things will settle down but if not, you may need to revisit the custody agreement if things don't improve. Or at the very least get your daughter into therapy so that she can develop some coping skills in her other home's environment. \n\nIf you do decide on the therapy route, find one that the courts in your area approve. That way, if your daughter reveals something that needs to be addressed in court, the therapists report will go a very long way in helping you/your daughter and will eliminate the need for her to have visits with a court approved therapist that she hasn't developed a rapport with previously. This is why I recommend finding a therapist that is already approved by the courts.", "Nta\n\nFor the record - my mom took me on bigger trips including to disney.\n\nMy dad actually paid attention to my needs and what I wanted and spent quality time with me.\n\nGuess who is still in my life. (It's my dad) I honestly don't really have positive memories of my mom because taking a kid somewhere while emotionally disconnected from them doesnt create a happy memory with the kid.  I have happy memories of some of the places, because even from fairly young my mom kind of ignored me while there, but I don't remember a *single* time my mom actually interacted with me in a healthy way.\n\nIt isn't disney. It's the caring for your daughter's well being and even if the most you could manage was playing in the living room, it would be enough for your daughter to prefer the person who respects her.", "NTA\n\nYou're doing fine OP, don't let your ex make you doubt your parenting. Material things are not spoiling your child, ex just sounds jealous.\n\nMy neighbor/friend spoiled her two grandkids with clothes, toys, didn't yell at them or was harsh with them.

You\u2019re not spoiling her, you\u2019re being a good dad who genuinely cares about her needs and interests, and gives her a safe space. Is there any way you can fight for more custody? Because you seem like the healthier and safer option for your daughter.", "Have to laugh a little bit. Literally a Disney dad. \nNTA unless you are prying or trying to encourage her to not like being at mums. Do you have a partner? If not she\u2019s probably enjoying the one on one attention. Keep being fun but don\u2019t turn her against her Mum.", "NTA", "NTA but I\u2019d keep my eye on that situation with the mom and new bf fighting a lot.  If that continues your daughter might want to come live with you or you may feel it\u2019s too unhealthy for her to be there.", "Nta!", "At first I thought it was N A H, but it's NTA.\n\nYou are a good dad.

Sounds like your ex is eager to get started on martial problems - even before the wedding!", "NTA!\n\nYou sound like an amazing dad. As you mentioned yourself, you listen, and your daughter notices that you're paying attention to her and her wants.
