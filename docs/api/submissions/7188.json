We have a custody agreement and I pay child support. I've never had any issues with it. I pay on time. I want my daughter to have a good life wherever she is so if the mom asks for money, I'll send extra as well .We've never had issues with that. We have a pretty friendly relationship and we don't argue. We'll be connected in someway forever so we keep it cordial. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI make good money but I'm no millionaire or anything like that. But my daughter stays with me so I have things that she'd like here. I have games and a pool. I don't really care for swimming but she enjoys being in a pool. I don't do anything ridiculous like buy her a pony or make large purchases without consulting her mother. But we go to fun events and I've taken her to Disneyland. I've taken her to see animals. Disneyland was probably the most expensive and big thing but that isn't common. I just listen to what she says and do things she enjoys. We make sure that she can't get away with things here or behave less disciplined depending on what house she is at. She has to be in bed at a certain time, do school work, chores etc. Punishment and rewards are the same no matter where she is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer mother has been serious with this guy. They seem to argue a lot and yell at each other. I haven't seen it this is just from what my daughter told me. That is one reason she enjoys being at my house because even if they aren't yelling at each other if they are upset there will be tense energy between them. Also they never seem to take what she wants into consideration. This is a problem that I faced when I was with her mother. If we're driving home and want to stop to get some quick food. She'd never take what our daughter wanted to eat into consideration. I'd always tell her that not every time she has to \"win\" but sometimes just deal with eating at place you don't like for her. Our daughter hardly asks for anything, she's not one of those kids. So the rare times she asks to go out and get a milkshake, I go out and get a milkshake. Her mother says she doesn't like being at her house and that I am spoiling her. She keeps bringing up how I took her to Disneyland one time like I do that every week or something. I don't think taking your kid to a zoo every now and then is spoiling.  I asked her if our daughter has said this ever but i guess she can just tell that she'd rather be at my house. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur daughter has always been a quiet kid and her mother knows this. So it's not hard to just listen to what she says. When she is really interested in something she'll speak up about it.

The Disney trip in particular seems to rankle her and that's an expensive, once in a lifetime experience for most people. Maybe she's irked that she wasn't the one to give your daughter those memories. Something that I've noticed with divorced or separated parents is that the parent with the day-to-day custody always feels inferior to the parent who swoops in for a weekend packed with fun stuff.\n\nRegardless of your ex's feelings on your visitation activities, your daughter is the priority. It's worth having a sit down with the ex and talking about the atmosphere at home and how you're concerned for your daughter. If your daughter is exceptionally unhappy, it might be tie to revisit the custody agreement.", "NTA\nYou are taking your daughter\u2019s wishes into consideration when making a decision, wishes it sounds like she doesn\u2019t make often.

It seems as though she\u2019s grateful that you\u2019re paying attention to her and giving her the validation that a child so dearly needs from a parental figure in their life. Ex is definitely jealous that she\u2019s facing the consequences of ignoring your daughter. I would assume the arguing is all a reason why she prefers your home over the ex, ex fails to reflect on herself and is looking for a scapegoat for her insecurities. You are not a bad father for showing your daughter affection, even if it is in the form of gifts.", "NTA it is mom, or more likeley the boyfriends behavior that is making her want to spend more time away from moms place", "NTA. Be sure to keep an eye on the situation with that guy her mom is seeing.

If your daughter doesn\u2019t like being at her house, it must be because you are spoiling her.  The reality is pretty obvious that her boyfriend and their relationship is the root of the problem.  I\u2019m sure your daughter picks up on any new tension between her parents, which isn\u2019t your fault.\n\nNot sure how receptive your ex would be to family therapy, but I think that would be beneficial.

Parenting is hard, and not every parent who struggles to keep up with their kids wants is inattentive.\n\nIt sure sounds like your wife is, though, and she wants you to stop giving your daughter what she wants not to help the two of them bond but to stop highlighting that she won't bond with her daughter.

It also seems like she prefers your house not because of your bank account but rather the environment and tense atmosphere at her mother's. She seems to have been fine with the schedule before the moms boyfriend came into the picture.

I wouldn't be surprised if she wants to move in with you full time and would look into contacting  a lawyer about getting primary care or full custody.

Keep it up and keep placing your daughter first. \n\nI would also recommend that you start documenting everything you can related to your ex's household that is affecting your daughter. Also keep a very, very close eye on what is going on there. Hopefully things will settle down but if not, you may need to revisit the custody agreement if things don't improve. Or at the very least get your daughter into therapy so that she can develop some coping skills in her other home's environment. \n\nIf you do decide on the therapy route, find one that the courts in your area approve. That way, if your daughter reveals something that needs to be addressed in court, the therapists report will go a very long way in helping you/your daughter and will eliminate the need for her to have visits with a court approved therapist that she hasn't developed a rapport with previously.
