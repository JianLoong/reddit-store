I simply didn't want to drag my 8 y/o son with me through the country.\n\nI initially wanted to ask my mother to watch my son as she usually does, but she was out of town herself and I only have my sister (24F) in the city that I live in. So I left my son with my sister and her girlfriend (30F).\n\nI would occasionally call and check on my son through the trip, and I told him several times that he should listen to his aunt. He is a very well-behaved young man and an absolute sweetheart.\n\nWhen I came back, I went over to my sister and her GFs place to thank them. My sister told me that while running around in the house, my son had broken a vase. That is quite unlike my son, he's never been naughty or ran in the house before even when he was a toddler.\n\nFor the record, before my sister moved in with her girlfriend, she lived in a normal house. Her GFs house is nothing short of a museum, with many expensive decorative fragile objects and has several collections. My sister told me me son had run around the house into the table that contained the vase, and then it had fallen down and been shattered into pieces. I told my sister my son was a very well-behaved boy and he would never run inside the house, let alone break something. \n\nI asked her what he had broken and it turned out to be an antique from Africa that cost about 900$. Her GF told me I shouldn't worry about replacing it (the cost is not AT ALL considerable for her but would be hard for me to pay) but maybe I should have a conversation with my son because they had explicitly asked him to not run around.\n\nI asked my son when I got home and he told me he had nothing to do with the vase being broken, and he said my sister was the one who broke it, when she had a pretty bad fight with her GF. \n\nSo I called my sister, told her what my son had told me and called her out on using my son to get away with her bad behavior. What they did was absolutely distasteful. She told me I was not being logical at all and that I needed to accept that my son was a kid and had simply made a mistake while he was running to the garden instead of accusing her. I said maybe she shouldn't have lied then. She doesn't answer my texts now.\n\nAITA in this?

An 8 year old is not going to good at judging risks. Honestly I find it more weird that your son *isn't* running in the house.\n\nIf you consistently have the perspective that your son can do no wrong then he could easily have learned that he can avoid responsibility by lying.\n\nOn the other hand your sister may have had a big fight with her SO and broken the vase.

Your son has never been naughty or run in the house for 8 years? Never? Not once? I realize I am relying on anecdata here, for all that's worth, but even as a kid who had so much to lose from misbehaving, I still did sometimes. Usually not intentionally: Kids can be clumsy and forgetful and sometimes they have to make a run for it to the bathroom. \n\nNTA for believing your kid in a he said-she said situation, but I think you seriously need to remove the rose-colored glasses before the consequences of refusing to believe your kid is anything other than perfect are greater than a broken vase.\n\nEdit: grammar", "I don't really want to make a judgement here. What I want to say is this ...\n\nNo matter what happened, going forward your sister should not be on the list of \"possible people to watch my kid.\" Either they have a house which is so fragile that a kid who is only low-key rambunctious got himself into trouble and broke a vase, or your sister and her wife had an argument which ended in a broken vase that your 8yo was present for or aware of (and that your sister/her wife then lied about).\n\nThis is not a good place to leave your kid no matter which option is true. This is not a good babysitting situation.", "YTA\n\nYou think your sister and her GF broke the vase during an argument.

Unless your sister and GF have a long history of narcissistic or strange behavior, you've picked a totally improbable series of events over the very probably possibility that your 8yo was acting out a bit in a new and different environment without his dad around.\n\nEDIT: Or do you think your sister is lying to everyone? And in that case why the \"What they did was absolutely distasteful.\" statement?", "It's a hard situation of he says/she says. Hard to know who's telling the truth.", "YTA. Your son may not be the perfect angel you think he is. Kids do dumb stuff all the time and accidents happen. I\u2019m not saying he broke the vase but I wouldn\u2019t discount the possibility he did.

This is standard golden child mentality.\n\nYour kid obviously broke the vase. Your sister wasn't seeking compensation, so she had no reason to lie. You're an asshole for not believing for your adult sister over a child. Kids misbehave and lie. He's 8, of course he's running in the house.", "YTA\n\n>Her GF told me I shouldn't worry about replacing it but maybe I should have a conversation with my son because they had explicitly asked him to not run around.\n\nBefore taking your son's side, you should have followed back up with the GF. \"Did you and my sister have a big fight prior to the vase being broken?\" If not, this isn't a he said / she said situation. It's two adults with a consistent perspective vs. your son saying something completely different.", "YTA you don't know how your kid is when you're not around.

Ugh.", "ESH. \n\nLet's clarify though, your child is not perfect or immune to being 8 lol. \n\nAll kids make mistakes, run, and break some rules. All of them.

You\u2019d have to believe that they conspired to frame your kid then broke off the relationship to back up that effort. Kids under stress, like those staying in unfamiliar situations and houses, tell adults the things they want to hear. It doesn\u2019t feel like a lie to them. It feels like they are fulfilling the expectations of the parent. I think your position doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.", "Need more information, though I\u2019m leaning toward NTA, only because the GF said you didn\u2019t have to pay for/replace the vase.

Hiding a fight by accusing his son of something? Makes no sense.", "or the adult wants to hide something. By not telling, what really happend and close the case as soon as possible. Even forgetting the compensation.", "Honestly if I didn\u2019t expect to get paid back for it why would i mention it? It\u2019s done and over and a nonissue if kid is on his way home why even bring it up? To make him feel bad?", "Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I took that to mean the apparent domestic dispute they had that was worth almost a thousand dollars of property damage, in front of an eight year old. If I found out that took place with my eight year old in the home, I\u2019d be furious.", "Lying is a developmental stage. Very young children lie partially because they cannot always tell the difference between truth and fiction, and because states of being (such as time and distance) are malleable to them, resulting in \"lies\" such as: Yesterday I went to Disneyland and won a million dollars! No,  really! (Translation: over the weekend, they went to a theme park with their family and won a carnival prize.) Over time, these lies become more intentional, as children begin to realize the difference between fact and fiction and learn they can impress their peers or authority figures with exaggerations. Then the social consequences of lying begin to catch up, and most children adjust accordingly.\n\nBut all children lie. It is a sign of imaginative development.", "Paraphrashed/partial comment stolen from: /u/Mbdwrxdd \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nkhmz/aita_for_calling_my_sister_out_because_she_lied/j6agaib/\n\nBot Reported.", "Maybe ended up not asking from his response.", "Most kids now arent going to be running around especially if they arent playing with other kids.

In a he said/ she said scenario it\u2019s only obvious you side with your son.", "Young man?!? He's eight!!", "I\u2019m leaning YTA right now. It wouldn\u2019t make sense for your sister to lie and say your son broke it unless she was requesting payment. Kids act a lot differently when they\u2019re not around their parents, and no offense but your description is biased because he\u2019s your child. Talk to the girlfriend and ask if he broke it. Honestly the way your sister handled it makes me think she\u2019s telling the truth. She didn\u2019t freak out, she wasn\u2019t mad, and she didn\u2019t see it as a big deal. She didn\u2019t ask that he be punished or anything, she just asked that you would talk to him about running around someone\u2019s house when they tell him not to. While I\u2019m glad you\u2019re an advocate for your kid, you gotta realize this is a he said she said situation, kids tell lies all the time and maybe he was, maybe he wasn\u2019t. All I\u2019m saying is the way you jumped to conclusions too fast, and you owe your sister an apology for accusing her of something so fast.", "While I do think you are kind of cool to talk with and listen to your son, I want to go with ESH.   \nWhether or not she lied about what happened or your son did, you didn't need to go fight her over this. It wasn't like she was demanding compensation or a punishment. You could have just kept it in mind that she may blame your son for things and not have her look after him in the future.", "YTA. Your scenario doesn't even make sense. Why would they lie about him breaking it but not ask for repayment? And you seriously expect us to believe that he has \"never been naughty or run in the house\" even as a toddler? Your sister is being very reasonable - he is a kid, and kids make mistakes. The question you should be asking is why he doesn't feel safe having you know that and what you need to do to help him feel safe about being home with you. YTA", "NTA No 8 year old would be creative or clever enough to come up with this specific story. He says the women fought and sister broke it out of spite after the fight and then blamed him. That doesn't sound like a fabrication a child could concoct. Also, the explanation of how the vase broke and that it so completely shattered also doesn't necessarily sound completely true. While some things would shatter on impact, that's rare and requires a precise set of circumstances. It's more likely to break into at least a few larger pieces with smaller pieces in between. To completely shatter sounds more like it being thrown into the floor.", "NTA.", "That seems like a pretty specific explanation of what happened from your son, not the sort of thing an 8 year old would make up. NTA. I think your sister tried to blame him so her GF wouldn\u2019t know she had a rage fit.", "NTA, most parents know what their kids do, but it is possible his behavior changed in a new environment but I would tend to believe my kid if they had never lied about something big.  The story the eight year old told was so specific and unusual.  I know my son at that age would never have had the experience to make up a lie like that.  Very elaborate if untrue vs. the adults saying the kid was running around and broke something is pretty easy blame, but the question is why? The story definitely sounds like the women were both there when it was broken in his story.  Strange.  Maybe they thought he would offer to pay?  Not sure but I will say it is good to believe your kid.", "And he has apparently never run in any house before in his life. Even as a toddler.\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t buy that.", "I'm with you. If the sister was asking OP to pay for the vase, I'd be more willing to believe the son because then the sister would have motive for lying. As it stands, though, her only possible motives for lying that I can see are \"wanting to make OP think poorly of his son/punish his son\" (which makes no sense) or \"wanting to cast doubt on the story about them fighting and her breaking the vase\" which makes a little more sense I guess if she's trying to cover up relationship problems or stop OP from thinking poorly of her for breaking a vase during an argument while his son was over- which is possible but doesn't seem super likely. Meanwhile, the son has a super strong reason to lie- he doesn't want to get in trouble or have his dad be mad at him.", "**Or maybe they didn't want to pay for a $900 vase**\n\nI don't why it is so hard. They broke the vase, the vase looks expensive and unique, possibly even knew it was a souvenir from Africa, so irreplaceable. Aka, costs quote a bit of $$$ and they assumed OP has some attachment to it. Easy to blame a 8 yo kid, since at that age it is unlikely they'll have to 'pay back' or face long term consequences.\n\nIt's so logical that I'm baffled by the upvotes and the whole spiel about 'its not your sis unless you think she purposely broke it and blamed on your son because she's a narcissist'. No, you don't have to be a narcissist to know that a parent will easily forgive their just 8 yo child, with only the possibility of taking electronics away for a week or so. And $900 is a lot of money.", "There hasn't been another occasion where he broke something but yes he is an honest boy", "My sister. Never did any of that\n\nAlso one kid I was an au pair for 3 years. He didn't misbehave, he did argue or would be stubborn, but he never did something he knew he wasn't allowed. The difficulty was to get him to do something he doesn't want, rather then NOT to do something he wants.\n\n\nKids have different tempers. Some take rules very seriously, my sister was a fucking snitch and also cried if she did something 'bad' before my parents even knew.", "> I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019d leave my kid with them again after this.\n\nPretty sure tossing a nuke into your sister\u2019s relationship effectively destroyed the possibility of that ever happening again, pal.", "How would lying about the son breaking a vase help cover up anything?", "Your kid has NEVER broken anything, in his 8 years of life? That sounds like quite a reach.", "Yep, lying and blaming someone else is distasteful.\n\nIf anything, your narrative makes even less sense. Distasteful is not a strong word, aka not strong enough to describe your scenario of the sister purposely breaking it and conspiring to blame OP's son, this would be abhorrent, not distasteful. Aka, OP doesn't believe sister broke it with some master plan in mind.", "The toddler thing is very unbelievable honestly. Toddlers don't know not to run. They don't know right from wrong at all so they will do things they are not supposed to do", "To be fair, he probably really remembered his mother being angry at what happened if hats all he said and that was his only takeaway because kids young are not going to say everything that happened even when they absolutely should", "Because it's so important to know?
