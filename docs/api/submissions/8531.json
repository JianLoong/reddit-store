So I left my son with my sister and her girlfriend (30F).\n\nI would occasionally call and check on my son through the trip, and I told him several times that he should listen to his aunt. He is a very well-behaved young man and an absolute sweetheart.\n\nWhen I came back, I went over to my sister and her GFs place to thank them. My sister told me that while running around in the house, my son had broken a vase. That is quite unlike my son, he's never been naughty or ran in the house before even when he was a toddler.\n\nFor the record, before my sister moved in with her girlfriend, she lived in a normal house. Her GFs house is nothing short of a musem, with many expensive decorative fragile objects and has several collections. My sister told me me son had run around the house into the table that contained the vase, and then it had fallen down and been shattered into pieces. I told my sister my son was a very well-behaved boy and he would never run inside the house, let alone break something. \n\nI asked her what he had broken and it turned out to be an antique from Africa that cost about 900$. Her GF told me I shouldn't worry about replacing it (the cost is not AT ALL considerable for her but would be hard for me to pay) but maybe I should have a conversation with my son because they had explicitly asked him to not run around.\n\nI asked my son when I got home and he told me he had nothing to do with the vase being broken, and he said my sister was the one who broke it, when she had a pretty bad fight with her GF. \n\nSo I called my sister, told her what my son had told me and called her out on using my son to get away with her bad behavior. What they did was absolutely distasteful. She told me I was not being logical at all and that I needed to accept that my son was a kid and had simply made a mistake while he was running to the garden instead of accusing her. I said maybe she shouldn't have lied then. She doesn't answer my texts now.\n\nAITA in this?

An 8 year old is not going to good at judging risks. Honestly I find it more weird that your son *isn't* running in the house.\n\nIf you consistently have the perspective that your son can do no wrong then he could easily have learned that he can avoid responsibility by lying.\n\nOn the other hand your sister may have had a big fight with her SO and broken the vase. She then might be motivated to lie to preserve her relationship with her SO.\n\n\\---\n\nINFO: Did your sister say that she was happy to care for your kid while you were away?", "As someone who grew up with an abusive parent, I am a huge proponent of believing children because I've lived the consequences of society believing the adult is always right.\n\nHowever, you strike me as a particularly unreliable narrator. Your son has never been naughty or run in the house for 8 years? Never? Not once? I realize I am relying on anecdata here, for all that's worth, but even as a kid who had so much to lose from misbehaving, I still did sometimes. Usually not intentionally: Kids can be clumsy and forgetful and sometimes they have to make a run for it to the bathroom. \n\nNTA for believing your kid in a he said-she said situation, but I think you seriously need to remove the rose-colored glasses before the consequences of refusing to believe your kid is anything other than perfect are greater than a broken vase.\n\nEdit: grammar", "I don't really want to make a judgement here. What I want to say is this ...\n\nNo matter what happened, going forward your sister should not be on the list of \"possible people to watch my kid.\" Either they have a house which is so fragile that a kid who is only low-key rambunctious got himself into trouble and broke a vase, or your sister and her wife had an argument which ended in a broken vase that your 8yo was present for or aware of (and that your sister/her wife then lied about).\n\nThis is not a good place to leave your kid no matter which option is true. This is not a good babysitting situation.", "YTA\n\nYou think your sister and her GF broke the vase during an argument.

Unless your sister and GF have a long history of narcissistic or strange behavior, you've picked a totally improbable series of events over the very probably possibility that your 8yo was acting out a bit in a new and different environment without his dad around.\n\nEDIT: Or do you think your sister is lying to everyone? And in that case why the \"What they did was absolutely distasteful.\" statement?", "It's a hard situation of he says/she says. Hard to know who's telling the truth.", "YTA. Your son may not be the perfect angel you think he is. Kids do dumb stuff all the time and accidents happen. I\u2019m not saying he broke the vase but I wouldn\u2019t discount the possibility he did.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your sister was telling the truth and your son has lied to you more times than you think/know because you believe him every time.", "YTA. This is standard golden child mentality.\n\nYour kid obviously broke the vase. Your sister wasn't seeking compensation, so she had no reason to lie. You're an asshole for not believing for your adult sister over a child. Kids misbehave and lie. He's 8, of course he's running in the house.", "YTA\n\n>Her GF told me I shouldn't worry about replacing it but maybe I should have a conversation with my son because they had explicitly asked him to not run around.\n\nBefore taking your son's side, you should have followed back up with the GF. \"Did you and my sister have a big fight prior to the vase being broken?\" If not, this isn't a he said / she said situation. It's two adults with a consistent perspective vs. your son saying something completely different.", "YTA you don't know how your kid is when you're not around. Kids are often a lot different in different environments and with other adults.

Ugh.", "ESH. \n\nLet's clarify though, your child is not perfect or immune to being 8 lol. \n\nAll kids make mistakes, run, and break some rules. All of them.

You\u2019d have to believe that they conspired to frame your kid then broke off the relationship to back up that effort. Kids under stress, like those staying in unfamiliar situations and houses, tell adults the things they want to hear. It doesn\u2019t feel like a lie to them. It feels like they are fulfilling the expectations of the parent. I think your position doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.", "Need more information, though I\u2019m leaning toward NTA, only because the GF said you didn\u2019t have to pay for/replace the vase.

I'm getting old I guess lol", "I've heard hundres of explanations from 8 year olds for many of their misbehaviors, as I was a teacher, and not a single one included two adults having a fight as the reason of their misbehavior. Kids lie about different stuff.", "I don\u2019t think that is a strange lie by the kid if it is one.  My problem with thinking the sister lied is that she could instead have said nothing about it, and OP wouldn\u2019t have known any about it. They didn\u2019t want money so why say anything about it unless it was true?", "ya, but that's an adult trying to blame a problem or allegations known to the other adults on a child specifically to avoid blame themselves and/or be compensated for their own mistake. But in this instance, there were no allegations, sister and GF brought it up in the first place.\n\nOP is being informed about a vase he didn't know about and not being asked to replace it. If anything, the sister and GF bringing it up makes it MORE likely OP would learn about the vase/fight if it happened. It just doesn't seem likely in this specific scenario that the adults would be lying.", ">I've heard hundres of explanations from 8 year olds for many of their misbehaviors\n\nUsername checks out :(", "Depends. If it was a violent fight with things being broken, in front of the child, then the parent is absolutely going to hear about it. They might just be trying to get out in front of the inevitable disclosure. Though in this case I agree, seems more likely the kid broke it.", "No, it doesn't."]}
