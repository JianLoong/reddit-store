Why would she even ask? Her telling you that she \"wanted to know if yours was an option too\" is ridiculous because of the difference in height & size. Most wedding dresses are fitted to the wearer, so there is very little leeway for letting it out. And she's 6 inches shorter? Nope.", "NAH, she\u2019s not an AH for asking, you\u2019re not an AH for saying no.", "NTA. She sounds painfully fake", "NAH so far. She's not an asshole for asking, and you're not an asshole for saying no. She'd only be the asshole if she refused to take no for an answer.", "NTA\n\nIf she's so loaded, she can afford her own dress.", "NTA, \"I don't want to\" is all the reason you need in this situation.", "NAH. You haven\u2019t written anything to suggest that she\u2019s pushing the issue at all. All she did is ask if using your dress was an option. Honestly, I find it somewhat interesting that you feel the need to repeatedly question their financial situation here.", "NTA for not loaning out your wedding dress. That's weird. \n\nYTA for your way of saying no.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your wedding dress, and your choice about what to do with it, including keeping it as a memento or whatever else you want. It's definitely weird that she would want to borrow your dress if she supposedly has so much money to burn. I could understand if part of it was an heirloom or something (I've heard of veils being passed down to be used by daughters when they grow up), but it isn't.", "NTA. It\u2019s your dress, do what you want with it.", "NTA alot of people keep their dress for life. Also why would you want to wear the exact same I find that very strange", "NTA. But isn't the whole point of keeping a wedding dress is so you can give it to someone you love?", "NTA.\n\nIs your sister Anna Delvey by any chance?", "NTA she can buy her own for her elopement. No Is an acceptable answer", "Offer to go wedding dress shopping with her.", "Absolutely, I had the exact same reaction as you", "Wow it's almost as if you know my sister. The boundary stomping is her jam", "I didn't want to offend her. It's not very nice to say something like that (right? Idk)", "If money is no object for her, she could buy the same dress in her size. At least that was my train of thought", "Haha \ud83d\ude04", "This is my view.\n\nWhen I read the title I was expecting a tantrum or something.\n\nAn accepted no was not one of them.", "This wedding dress thing is the straw that broke the camel's back. She has repeatedly taken advantage of me financially. She will do stuff like invite me to an expensive restaurant and then conveniently forget her wallet. I realize that the financial comment makes sense to me with all the history we have, but it may not have been relevant here. I'm not sure.", "Thank you kind stranger", "Agreed, I wouldn't say that!  But I would say that no, I was planning on keeping my dress unaltered but would be happy to tell her where I got it, style it's called or whatever.   I have a daughter so my excuse would be so she can have it someday.\n\nETA NAH, and I agree with another commenter, she's only TA if she doesn't take no for an answer", "It's not offensive if it's true. She might get defensive or upset but it's the truth.", "Fair point. I was wondering if maybe your dress in particular holds sentimental value for her.\n\nAnd you mentioned this in your post--what if the wealth is a front? You never know if the wealth isn't as much as it seems. And you're already having doubts on that \ud83e\udd14\n\nAlso, this *might* be a stretch, but I just had another thought: this might be an indirect way of her trying to get your support for this marriage. She might sense your doubts and is trying to connect with you and keep you invested because she cares about you.", "That is very fair. Conveniently forgetting your wallet isn\u2019t necessarily reflective of financial struggle though, so much as general asshole behavior. You can be rich and still be an asshole.", "That blows my mind...you're absolutely right", "NTA make sure she doesn't have access to the dress", "NTA she can get a copy of yours on poshmark in her proper size and alter it for her height if she likes it so much.", "NAH. She asked, you said no, and she only replied she wanted to know if it was an option. \n\nWe don't know why she wanted it, maybe she admired you in it, maybe she couldn't hide a dress for elopement, and maybe she wanted to live up to \"something borrowed.\" Either way, I don't see the conflict here.", "NTA...", "NTA.", "op=NTA\n\nYou certainly don't ever have to loan out your clothes(okay, if someone's in your home and your baby pukes all over it, then offering a t-shirt is obviously the \"Right\" thing to do).\n\nI agree, that your sister's situations sounds a bit off.  I would stay completely out of it.  Be on the lookout for requests for loans.  Something like.  My assets are tied up in a long term yadda yadda, could you front me $X.", "NTA. Entitled much, Lil' Sis?", "NTA.  I don't think she has options. Her answer sounds like saving face.  Anyway, it doesn't fit her. Enough said.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t want to loan the dress out, it stays in your closet.  It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s rich or not. As said many times before, \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence.", "NTA", "Based on the information you have provided, I don't think you're the asshole (NTA) for not letting your sister borrow your wedding dress. It's understandable that you wouldn't want the dress altered or potentially damaged, and it doesn't seem like a practical option given the size difference.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that your sister's financial situation shouldn't necessarily factor into the decision. Just because someone has money doesn't mean they're entitled to borrow or have anything they want. It's your dress and ultimately your decision whether or not to lend it out.\n\nThat being said, it's possible that your sister may be disappointed or upset by your refusal. It might be worth having a conversation with her to explain your reasoning and perhaps suggest some alternative options (such as shopping for a dress together or offering to help cover the cost of a new dress). It's ultimately up to you how to handle the situation, but I don't believe you're in the wrong for saying no.", "NTA. Apparently this is another in a long line of grifting you attempts which is why you're annoyed. I understand.", "NTA. If you loaned your dress to her, she would alter it and it would not fit you anymore. Many people save their dresses in case they sometimes have a daughter who wants to wear it and you don't know how tall your daughter will be.\n\nShe can get her own dress.", "NTA. \n\nI suspect sister is either doing a power play (trying to see how many boundaries she can get people to agree to let her cross) and/or a compulsive shopper that literally wants to window shop all the options.", "Whenever i read about a \"can i borrow your wedding dress\" story i always, ALWAYS think of that one scene i think in 27 dresses where one sister was \"borrowing\" their dead moms dress and basically butchered the ever living shit out of it, but kept scraps, and therefore ruined the other sisters chance to wear it. NTA. Your wedding dress. Doesnt matter if it's just sitting there so long as you're okay with it. Even if you tou trusted her, a lot of stuff could happen in transport, day off, etc.", "NAH. There's no harm in her asking (compared so some aita on here this pretty mild!), but also perfectly reasonable to say no!", "NTA\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t fit her so it\u2019s not an option even if you were willing.\n\nShe can go buy one.", "NAH\n\nI don\u2019t get how so many people are saying your sister is an asshole. Borrowing a wedding dress from a family member is fairly common. I don\u2019t see what the big deal is with her asking. She asked, you said no, and she apparently accepted it.\n\nI don\u2019t even really understand what the conflict is.", "NTA, it would have been one thing if she thought it would be sentimental or something but it sounds like she either wants it to overshadow your use of it or alter it to wreck it or the final option like you suspect her fiance isn't a multi millionaire but after that little comment about seeing if yours was an option lol miss me with that attitude.", "NOPE Nta.  \n\n\nYour dress, your decision. No is a complete sentence and you don't even have to mention the height/weigh difference to justify your decision.", "INFO: Why didn\u2019t you just ask her why? Why did you immediately bring her fianc\u00e9\u2019s finances into it? \n\nIt\u2019s a strange request but my first thought wouldn\u2019t have been to interrogate about finances. \n\nFrom your comments, your sister doesn\u2019t sound so great but honestly, neither do you. You sound jealous and she sounds like she boundary stomps.", "It's your wedding dress, and your choice about what to do with it, including keeping it as a memento or whatever else you want.", "Her answer sounds like saving face.", "NTA\u2026I wouldn\u2019t want someone to alter my wedding dress either.", "She lives 2,583 miles away from it, but good tip \ud83d\ude09", "What about this post makes you think OP\u2019s sister would do something to her dress?
