Why would she even ask? Her telling you that she \"wanted to know if yours was an option too\" is ridiculous because of the difference in height & size.

Nope.", "NAH, she\u2019s not an AH for asking, you\u2019re not an AH for saying no.", "NTA. She sounds painfully fake", "NAH so far.

That's weird. \n\nYTA for your way of saying no.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your wedding dress, and your choice about what to do with it, including keeping it as a memento or whatever else you want. It's definitely weird that she would want to borrow your dress if she supposedly has so much money to burn.

I realize that the financial comment makes sense to me with all the history we have, but it may not have been relevant here. I'm not sure.", "Thank you kind stranger", "Agreed, I wouldn't say that!

I was wondering if maybe your dress in particular holds sentimental value for her.\n\nAnd you mentioned this in your post--what if the wealth is a front? You never know if the wealth isn't as much as it seems. And you're already having doubts on that \ud83e\udd14\n\nAlso, this *might* be a stretch, but I just had another thought: this might be an indirect way of her trying to get your support for this marriage. She might sense your doubts and is trying to connect with you and keep you invested because she cares about you.", "That is very fair. Conveniently forgetting your wallet isn\u2019t necessarily reflective of financial struggle though, so much as general asshole behavior.

Entitled much, Lil' Sis?", "NTA.  I don't think she has options. Her answer sounds like saving face.  Anyway, it doesn't fit her. Enough said.", "NTA.

It's understandable that you wouldn't want the dress altered or potentially damaged, and it doesn't seem like a practical option given the size difference.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that your sister's financial situation shouldn't necessarily factor into the decision. Just because someone has money doesn't mean they're entitled to borrow or have anything they want. It's your dress and ultimately your decision whether or not to lend it out.\n\nThat being said, it's possible that your sister may be disappointed or upset by your refusal. It might be worth having a conversation with her to explain your reasoning and perhaps suggest some alternative options (such as shopping for a dress together or offering to help cover the cost of a new dress). It's ultimately up to you how to handle the situation, but I don't believe you're in the wrong for saying no.", "NTA. Apparently this is another in a long line of grifting you attempts which is why you're annoyed. I understand.", "NTA.

NTA. Your wedding dress. Doesnt matter if it's just sitting there so long as you're okay with it. Even if you tou trusted her, a lot of stuff could happen in transport, day off, etc.", "NAH. There's no harm in her asking (compared so some aita on here this pretty mild!), but also perfectly reasonable to say no!", "NTA\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t fit her so it\u2019s not an option even if you were willing.\n\nShe can go buy one.", "NAH\n\nI don\u2019t get how so many people are saying your sister is an asshole.
