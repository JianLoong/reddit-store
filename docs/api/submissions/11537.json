Why would she want a wedding dress \u201cso basic\u201d if she could get anyone she wants, IF her husband to be is that wealthy? Keep your wedding dress.

For me it isn\u2019t about how much money they have but more about not wanting to have someone significantly alter my wedding dress.", "I can imagine your wedding dress would hold a lot sentimental value for you!

Why would she even ask? Her telling you that she \"wanted to know if yours was an option too\" is ridiculous because of the difference in height & size. Most wedding dresses are fitted to the wearer, so there is very little leeway for letting it out. And she's 6 inches shorter? Nope.", "NAH, she\u2019s not an AH for asking, you\u2019re not an AH for saying no.", "NTA. She sounds painfully fake", "NAH so far. She's not an asshole for asking, and you're not an asshole for saying no. She'd only be the asshole if she refused to take no for an answer.", "NTA\n\nIf she's so loaded, she can afford her own dress.", "NTA, \"I don't want to\" is all the reason you need in this situation.", "NAH. You haven\u2019t written anything to suggest that she\u2019s pushing the issue at all. All she did is ask if using your dress was an option. Honestly, I find it somewhat interesting that you feel the need to repeatedly question their financial situation here.", "NTA for not loaning out your wedding dress. That's weird. \n\nYTA for your way of saying no.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your wedding dress, and your choice about what to do with it, including keeping it as a memento or whatever else you want. It's definitely weird that she would want to borrow your dress if she supposedly has so much money to burn. I could understand if part of it was an heirloom or something (I've heard of veils being passed down to be used by daughters when they grow up), but it isn't.", "NTA. It\u2019s your dress, do what you want with it.", "NTA alot of people keep their dress for life. Also why would you want to wear the exact same I find that very strange", "NTA. But isn't the whole point of keeping a wedding dress is so you can give it to someone you love?", "NTA.\n\nIs your sister Anna Delvey by any chance?", "NTA she can buy her own for her elopement. No Is an acceptable answer", "Offer to go wedding dress shopping with her.", "Absolutely, I had the exact same reaction as you", "Wow it's almost as if you know my sister. The boundary stomping is her jam", "I didn't want to offend her. It's not very nice to say something like that (right? Idk)", "If money is no object for her, she could buy the same dress in her size. At least that was my train of thought", "Haha \ud83d\ude04", "This is my view.\n\nWhen I read the title I was expecting a tantrum or something.\n\nAn accepted no was not one of them.", "This wedding dress thing is the straw that broke the camel's back. She has repeatedly taken advantage of me financially. She will do stuff like invite me to an expensive restaurant and then conveniently forget her wallet. I realize that the financial comment makes sense to me with all the history we have, but it may not have been relevant here. I'm not sure.", "Thank you kind stranger", "Agreed, I wouldn't say that!  But I would say that no, I was planning on keeping my dress unaltered but would be happy to tell her where I got it, style it's called or whatever.   I have a daughter so my excuse would be so she can have it someday.\n\nETA NAH, and I agree with another commenter, she's only TA if she doesn't take no for an answer", "It's not offensive if it's true. She might get defensive or upset but it's the truth.", "Fair point. I was wondering if maybe your dress in particular holds sentimental value for her.\n\nAnd you mentioned this in your post--what if the wealth is a front? You never know if the wealth isn't as much as it seems. And you're already having doubts on that \ud83e\udd14\n\nAlso, this *might* be a stretch, but I just had another thought: this might be an indirect way of her trying to get your support for this marriage. She might sense your doubts and is trying to connect with you and keep you invested because she cares about you.", "That is very fair. Conveniently forgetting your wallet isn\u2019t necessarily reflective of financial struggle though, so much as general asshole behavior. You can be rich and still be an asshole.", "That blows my mind...you're absolutely right"]}
