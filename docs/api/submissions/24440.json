NO!\n\nI totally get why you would change flights. It makes sense and helps to avoid confrontation that you dont need.\n\nBuy why oh why did you tell her about it? You should have just said things got changed at the last minute, you had to reschedule EVERYTHING, and would not be home for several days.  If you have to say anything at all, just keep it simple that things changed. Telling the cousin the truth before it all goes down just gives her the opportunity to turn it all on you and say you are petty for what you did.\n\nYou chose the passive aggressive solution, but then telling cousin just eliminates the passive.", "NTA.

I would have done exactly the same thing as you did, but probably told her at the last minute. \"*...as a seasoned traveller I can help her settle and occupy their baby on the flight\"* is crazy talk.

BTW NTA", "I've never been a doormat.   I had so much help with my baby when I was diagnosed  with Lupus and COPD.   Families sacrificed for me.   Friends sacrificed for me.    I spent 31 days in the hospital.  Friends and family gave their time, their vacation days, and in ways that most couldn't imagine.  I pulled myself up and went into remission.  You better believe that I gave back.   Of course,  I gave up my sleep for new mothers.   I kept their children because they were overwhelmed.   My husband was at my side the entire time of ups and downs with my health.   That was thirty some odd years ago.   My best friend was the only match for my kidney.  Yes, she did.   I've been at their side in their time of need. Absolutely I've flown half way across the world to help them with their babies.  I flew to Giessen, Germany  to help.   I believe in paying it forward.   \n\nI've been married fifty years.    Pay it forward...   Inconvenience yourself because you care.    It builds character."]}
