I was in his wedding party as an usher. I didn't know it at the time but Rachel was bulimic. She struggled on and off since she was in college and the stress of the wedding planning and made it out of control. Not long after the wedding Rachel was hospitalized. She went to inpatient rehab for a while. Last week she was one year clean from bulimia.\n\nMy brother said Rachel wants to redo their wedding pictures. I didn't know this was a thing but Rachel had something called bulimia cheeks. I didn't realize it at the wedding. But looking at Rachel now vs. back then it was obvious. My brother said she's embarrassed and hates those photos. I thought he meant that him and Rachel would get dressed up in their wedding clothes and get new photos.\n\nRachel wants not just them, but their immediate families and wedding parties to. She knows she can't get all the guests to come back to do it and the pictures with guests in them will always exist. But she wants the families and wedding party to wear the clothes they wore to the wedding and go to the church and then the banquet hall to redo the pictures. Even the ones of everyone at the altar during the ceremony. I think this is ridiculous.\n\nThe church and the banquet hall are booked up evenings and weekends. So we can only do it on a weekday. I'd have to pay to rent a tux again, drive almost 4 hours one way and spend almost the entire day or at least several hours posing for photos, doing the formal portraits and standing/sitting at the altar of the church and the head table. The church and banquet hall said we have to be out before 12am (church) and 4pm (banquet hall). I would also have to get up before 5am to get there on time. It's worse for the women. They have to pay to get their hair, makeup and nails done the same as they were at the wedding. It's ridiculous.\n\nI love my brother and I wanted to do whatever I could to give him the wedding he wanted. Him and Rachel wanted to save money so the wedding parties helped them a lot. We printed the invitations and printed the envelopes too and stuffed them. They had 364 guests. We made the centerpieces for the tables at the reception. We made Rachel's and the bridesmaid's bouquets. We decorated the banquet hall ourselves and then took them down after the wedding. And about a hundred other things. I didn't complain but it was exhausting. I had use so much time for wedding stuff.\n\nI said I'm not doing it. My brother says I'm being an asshole and this is important to Rachel. He's angry because Rachel got upset I said no. He's putting pressure on me because she's part of the family and was sick back then. I do love Rachel but I don't want to take yet another day off work for this Am I right or is he right that I'm the asshole?

Honestly, to me, it would make more sense for them to renew their vows at 5 years, have a party, and get new pictures.

Why risk a second disappointment instead of waiting a little while and creating a new set of memories.", "NTA, if she wants it so bad, she needs to pick up the bills for everyone.

Have a new party and celebrate her good health. \n\nIt's almost as if she's trying to pretend that she had never been sick.

No. Unless the families are millionaires that can spare the expenses.", "That's why I said there should be compromises on having everything exactly the same.

Its her sign of being satisfied with her appearance (a big step towards improvement), and will most likely give her closure and an escape from her disorder. Also, if this isn't done, she might end up associating her wedding day, something that's meant to be joyous, to her bulimia, something she struggled with and is not so pleasant. The portraits are fine, since they are an individual decision.\n\nThe wedding party... not so much... because it involves so many other people. Other adults have their own problems and schedules.

This is something even I could do on a picture or two; there's no way a professional photographer wouldn't be able to do it. I don't know if it's that they were unreasonable with the photographer or if Rachel just really needs this re-do, but no fucking way did several photographers say it was impossible.\n\nMaybe she's doing this because she really wants to feel loved and supported by family and friends right now, and this feels to her like that - but it's not. It's just the image of the thing, not the thing itself, and it's going to do nothing to scratch that itch. (Yeah, my absolutely-no-psych-training ass is absolutely dying to talk about how this might tie in to her illness, but that is not what we're here for.) If that's what she wants, a \"getting better\" party, or a big bash for her next bday, or a family vacation would all be much better ideas.\n\nBecause, to be frank, this is just an absolutely bonkers, *completely* off the rails request. It's reasonable for her to want her face re-done to reflect her in a healthier state, but asking everyone else to retake their pictures too? Renting out the venues and everything? It's wild. Is she trying to get a do-over for the entire wedding? (Next she'll ask you all to bring gifts!) \n\nShe is wasting her own and everyone else's time, money, and energy trying to create the mirage of a perfect past. She really needs to be talking with her therapist about why she feels the need to go to such extremes here. She's obviously trying to fill an emotional need, but I really don't think this will do it, and she may need even more support once she realizes that. I worry that when this *doesn't* fill that emotional gap, she's not going to turn inward for answers, but will instead try to blame you and anyone else who wasn't able to be perfect. \n\nThis sounds like something that started off being a stepping stone on the recovery path, but is now becoming a hurdle.

Hasn't anybody involved ever heard of Photoshop?", "I agree that retaking all the wedding photos again sounds dumb, but I would like to add something to consider:  \nassuming I had a SIL struggling with bulimia and winning - I would have arrangeed a party to celebrate this milestone. this is actually a hugh thing.  \nAnd if she want to celebrate it by new wedding photos - so be it. (of course, I'd still consider my financial ability, and won't spend on it more than I would have spend on such party)", "NTA, because they are expecting you to pay. \n\nHonestly, if you weren\u2019t going to be out of pocket my vote would be different because sometimes we should do stupid, inconvenient things  - like making an eight hour return trip to reenact wedding photos on a work day - to make someone we love happy. It\u2019s good for us and them. This, and not blood or marriage, is what makes people family. \n\nBut them expecting everyone else to pay their own expenses is not reasonable. If they are insisting on this it\u2019s only right that they should pay for it.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s a lot to expect of people to do.", "Can\u2019t they just photoshop her cheeks fuller?  Also, why should everyone be paying for all this all over again?  They want it done, they should offer to pay for the tuxes, hair being redone etc", "NTA, and this is the most ridiculous thing I've heard of (at least today!). I'm sorry your SIL has been ill but it sounds like she needs more therapy to understand what an impossible and pointless task this is.", "NTA. Photoshop and therapy would be much cheaper and way less hassle for everyone.", "This is neurotic behaviour.  The should just take some anniversary pics of themselves. Imagine asking all those people to go to all that effort! I'd never have the nerve. The cheek of some people ( see what I did there?).\n\nNTA", "NTA I was going to say NAH because it\u2019s nice your brother wants to support his wife\u2019s recovery and I\u2019m sorry she feels so bad about her pictures/illness. BUT then I read where they\u2019re being entitled jerks about it. \n\nIt\u2019s totally unreasonable for them to try to recreate history at great expense to everyone else. I also notice they\u2019re not offering to throw a redo dinner or reception\u2026or in any way show appreciation for everyone participating in this. \n\nAnd I refuse to believe that the original photos can\u2019t be edited\u2026if not to change her cheeks, then to cut her out of the original and replace her with HER redo photos without making the entire wedding party spend $1,000s on this.", "Also, they wanted to save money the first go around, but they\u2019re willing to go to this extreme expense for this foolishness. What does that say about all the help that was given to them the first time ??????", "NTA Honestly she seems like she is still struggling hard with body image issues. As someone who used to have Bulimia I get it, but it doesn't do her any good to go down this road for her. Her body acceptance needs to come from within herself.", "NTA. What an absurd thing to ask of someone. Also, I\u2019m no expert but this plan doesn\u2019t feel particularly healthy. She\u2019s going to such lengths because her face looks puffy in photos? It seems like someone in ED recovery shouldn\u2019t be so focused on something appearance based.", "NTA", "It's gotta be easier to pay someone to touch up the couple dozen photos she actually needs than to reorganize an entire shoot, take photos, and then do editing anyway.", "A bride and groom are going to be the front centre of all group photos, it should be easy enough to photoshop. They\u2019re either lazy or lack the photoshop skills. There will definitely be someone out there who can amend the photos for them.  (Speaking as a Graphic designer)", "I find it hard to believe the original photos can\u2019t be edited, either to cover up the issues or swap her face out from a newer photo that might just require her getting the hair and makeup done.\n\nIt may very well be time consuming, especially if there\u2019s a lot to do, so she would likely need to pay, but it shouldn\u2019t cost more than getting everyone to come back and pose for photos. I certainly wouldn\u2019t go and retake them unless she covered all costs (fuel, tux rents, hotel, etc\u2026) and even then I probably wouldn\u2019t do 8hr drive plus 1/2 a day spent retaking photos.\n\nMaybe you could suggest she posts 1 of the photos to somewhere like /r/PhotoshopRequest along side a recent image for reference and state she has X photos that need doing that she will pay Y amount for if she\u2019s happy with how it looks?", "This is what makes them massive assholes to me! They\u2019re asking a HUGE, *expensive* favor of you (and everyone else). And they\u2019re acting ENTITLED to it. It\u2019s one thing to do this for the wedding, it\u2019s another to spend another $1,000 on gas, hotel, tux rental, (not to mention time and hassle) so she can rewrite history. And they don\u2019t seem at all aware of that, or trying to mitigate that. \n\nYou should ask where the open bar and free fancy dinner is since that was there last time, too\u2026 ;)", "YTA. It's not like this is just vanity, eating disorders literally kill people every day. She's lucky to be alive, and it would cost you one day. I hear that you think it's silly, but have you never wanted anything silly in your life? Your brother could have lost his wife, they want to celebrate that she's alive and it's...too much for you.", "NTA.   \n\nRachel is still bullemic; she just isn't expressing it with food. It's like a dry drunk, when alcoholics don't drink but are still a h's.\n\nRachel needs a lot more therapy and you don't need to cater to her mental illness.", "NTA.  If your brother and Rachel want this so bad of their bridal party they need to pay for everyone's fuel, hotel room, nails, hair.   I am betting you're not the only person who expressed concern or is saying no.   Probably some friends are not saying it to them but thinking I don't want to do this and will lose contact with them after it.", "She can dress up and take new pictures. A good photographer can swap her head on to the original - no reason to do all this plus it will be extremely expensive to rent everything again. Thought they wanted to save money ????? Have everybody come and do all that just for her vanity/ mental illness doesn\u2019t make any sense at all This is going to be a difficult marriage I\u2019m predicting.", "I\u2019d tell your brother you can\u2019t afford it but if he is able to rent the tux for you and pay your gas you\u2019ll come for the day. Nta", "NTA. I can understand Rachel wanting to redo the pics, but she and your brother should understand how unreasonable is to reenact everything to the letter. They should just accept to make new pictures with similar clothes but without all the details.", "NTA\nIt seems weird to me for your bro and SIL to \"recreate\" their wedding pictures to erase evidence of her condition in the past. Expecting the extended family to dress up for the erasure photo shoot is unrealistic. \nIt's great that she is in a healthier place now. That doesn't change her past and her history. It seems unhealthy that she, and your brother, think this is both a good idea and reasonable to impose on others.\n\n You don't deserve to be the target of their frustration because you have boundaries against participating in her erasure charade. Sticking by your decision and refusing to engage in argument is the best tactic. \"That doesn't work for me. Best of luck to you.\" Then, \"I'm not doing that. Is there something else you'd like to talk about?\" Then, a flat \"no\" and end the conversation.", "NTA, does your brother and Rachel know that Adobe Photoshop exists?", "&#x200B;\n\nNTA.\n\nI have never had ED, but I can sympathize. Being reminded of a bad time in your life every time you look at your wedding pictures...so yeah, I can understand her wanting to get them retaken.\n\nBUT! You can't retake all of them. And if people have moved on with their lives and actually MOVED, that's going to be inconvenient for everyone. Some folks don't have time or money for that.\n\n(at first I was going to suggest just have a renewal of vows and take pictures then, but then I took in that the original wedding was 18 MONTHS AGO. 18 years? okay. Months? That makes this even MORE of an NTA.)\n\nOooh, who suggested professional photoshop? That is indeed a thing they could do.", "Do they know of a miraculous thing called Photoshop? Paying someone to retouch all of her pictures is much more cheap and easy ....", "If they want this done, they need to cover all the expenses. I would not participate in doing this insane thing.", "NTA. Maybe let the both of them get some pictures with each other for some personal memory and to keep and showcase in their house. Don't bother everybody else.", "NTA. If Rachel and your brother want to re-do the pix, they should do it. The two of them\n\nI guess we all can see that Rachel wants to re-do the wedding b/c she's at a much better place now, and Kudos to her for getting treatment! But asking everyone in the family/wedding party to make the trip, do all the prep\\~is asking too much, IMO. \n\n  Your brother & SIL are upset because they want this, not because you're unreasonable.", "Well let's break it down - 1 day off work easy, rent a tux, easy drive 4 hours easy. I see they are asking you to combine 3 easy things to please them and you're saying no. Then again her hating her pictures is kinda a her problem. To be honest whatever you decide to do it's a NTA ultimately your decisions and whatever you decide you have to live with, just know this, shall you refuse the consequences will be long lasting whereas if you inconvenience yourself for a day it will be over before you even know it.", "NTA. Let them know the cost of flights, accommodation, tux rental, and reimbursement for your time, and ask them if they're going to handle the admin or just send you the money. They will soon put this to bed.", "They should save their money and in five or ten years time, go abroad somewhere nice and renew their vows.", "Yeah if it was local and OP had to just put on a suit and show up for a couple of hours I would say he should just deal with it but this is insane. Bride and groom should just have the original pictures edited", "Right?  OP would lose a day's work, pay for a tux, drive 8 hours roundtrip, and spend a day posing. (I'd find it hard to smile and look happy if I got bullied into doing this.)  On top of all this, OP was instrumental in saving them a ton of money the first time. Printing invites, making bouquets, and setting up and cleaning the venue.\n\n**OR,** Rachel can pay for some photoshopped pictures. \n\nNTA.", "willing to bet brother isn\u2019t willing to pay for OP & the others expenses in recreating this stunt but OP MUST do it cuz he\u2019s FaMiLy.", "That's what I'm saying.  Now multiply that by everyone else involved in the photos and we're talking a major expense and great effort...with them already understanding everyone can't be there anyway.      \n      \nGet a handful of the original pics professionally edited, hide all the rest, regift the new ones and then take lots of happy-healthy-now pictures so people see her as she is now and don't ever think about the past her that only she doesn't like anyway.  This is all still a \"her\" issue about how she looks.  She's only a year recovered and clearly has a long road to go.  We can't be too hard on her but we also shouldn't let her be unreasonable.", "You have absolutely hit the nail on the head here. She will inevitably move on to something else when this fails to fulfil the emotional need she has regarding that time in her life. This is completely becoming a block and not a step towards healing and no one should be entertaining this.\n\nAn anniversary party or similar where you all dress up again would be much more appropriate. \n\nOP good luck and stand your ground. You are NTA.", "They clearly do not care about their guests at all."]}
