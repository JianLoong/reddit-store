I was in his wedding party as an usher. I didn't know it at the time but Rachel was bulimic. She struggled on and off since she was in college and the stress of the wedding planning and made it out of control. Not long after the wedding Rachel was hospitalized. She went to inpatient rehab for a while. Last week she was one year clean from bulimia.\n\nMy brother said Rachel wants to redo their wedding pictures. I didn't know this was a thing but Rachel had something called bulimia cheeks. I didn't realize it at the wedding. But looking at Rachel now vs. back then it was obvious. My brother said she's embarrassed and hates those photos. I thought he meant that him and Rachel would get dressed up in their wedding clothes and get new photos.\n\nRachel wants not just them, but their immediate families and wedding parties to. She knows she can't get all the guests to come back to do it and the pictures with guests in them will always exist. But she wants the families and wedding party to wear the clothes they wore to the wedding and go to the church and then the banquet hall to redo the pictures. Even the ones of everyone at the altar during the ceremony. I think this is ridiculous.\n\nThe church and the banquet hall are booked up evenings and weekends. So we can only do it on a weekday. I'd have to pay to rent a tux again, drive almost 4 hours one way and spend almost the entire day or at least several hours posing for photos, doing the formal portraits and standing/sitting at the altar of the church and the head table. The church and banquet hall said we have to be out before 12am (church) and 4pm (banquet hall). I would also have to get up before 5am to get there on time. It's worse for the women. They have to pay to get their hair, makeup and nails done the same as they were at the wedding. It's ridiculous.\n\nI love my brother and I wanted to do whatever I could to give him the wedding he wanted. Him and Rachel wanted to save money so the wedding parties helped them a lot. We printed the invitations and printed the envelopes too and stuffed them. They had 364 guests. We made the centerpieces for the tables at the reception. We made Rachel's and the bridesmaid's bouquets. We decorated the banquet hall ourselves and then took them down after the wedding. And about a hundred other things. I didn't complain but it was exhausting. I had use so much time for wedding stuff.\n\nI said I'm not doing it. My brother says I'm being an asshole and this is important to Rachel. He's angry because Rachel got upset I said no. He's putting pressure on me because she's part of the family and was sick back then. I do love Rachel but I don't want to take yet another day off work for this Am I right or is he right that I'm the asshole? I'm asking because a lot of people seem happy to do this for her and think people who aren't are assholes.", "created_utc": 1684032740, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h0j7x/aita_for_not_wanting_to_participate_in_my_brother/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly, to me, it would make more sense for them to renew their vows at 5 years, have a party, and get new pictures. Trying to recreate something to the extent they are is never going to come out the way they want. It's staged pictures, not an actual wedding. Why risk a second disappointment instead of waiting a little while and creating a new set of memories.", "NTA, if she wants it so bad, she needs to pick up the bills for everyone.  How well do you know the women?  For them to take time off work, pay for hair, nails and makeup again.  If the dress does not fit to have it altered.

In the lightest possible way YTA. Yes it is absolutely a lot to ask. But this is ONE day. One day of your life to ensure your SIL whom is your family, and you love that she can look at her wedding photos and not feel shame, or regret. I think you could all compromise on some of the details, like getting makeup, hair, and everything exactly the same. But I think it's okay to spare one day.

If the photographer they used can't do it, they should be able to find a pro photo editor to do it for them.", "This is it exactly! How far she has come in her life journey!

Have a new party and celebrate her good health. \n\nIt's almost as if she's trying to pretend that she had never been sick.

No. Unless the families are millionaires that can spare the expenses.", "That's why I said there should be compromises on having everything exactly the same.

Its her sign of being satisfied with her appearance (a big step towards improvement), and will most likely give her closure and an escape from her disorder. Also, if this isn't done, she might end up associating her wedding day, something that's meant to be joyous, to her bulimia, something she struggled with and is not so pleasant. The portraits are fine, since they are an individual decision.\n\nThe wedding party... not so much... because it involves so many other people. Other adults have their own problems and schedules. They aren't obligated to do this.

This is something even I could do on a picture or two; there's no way a professional photographer wouldn't be able to do it. I don't know if it's that they were unreasonable with the photographer or if Rachel just really needs this re-do, but no fucking way did several photographers say it was impossible.\n\nMaybe she's doing this because she really wants to feel loved and supported by family and friends right now, and this feels to her like that - but it's not. It's just the image of the thing, not the thing itself, and it's going to do nothing to scratch that itch. (Yeah, my absolutely-no-psych-training ass is absolutely dying to talk about how this might tie in to her illness, but that is not what we're here for.) If that's what she wants, a \"getting better\" party, or a big bash for her next bday, or a family vacation would all be much better ideas.\n\nBecause, to be frank, this is just an absolutely bonkers, *completely* off the rails request. It's reasonable for her to want her face re-done to reflect her in a healthier state, but asking everyone else to retake their pictures too? Renting out the venues and everything? It's wild. Is she trying to get a do-over for the entire wedding? (Next she'll ask you all to bring gifts!) \n\nShe is wasting her own and everyone else's time, money, and energy trying to create the mirage of a perfect past. She really needs to be talking with her therapist about why she feels the need to go to such extremes here. She's obviously trying to fill an emotional need, but I really don't think this will do it, and she may need even more support once she realizes that. I worry that when this *doesn't* fill that emotional gap, she's not going to turn inward for answers, but will instead try to blame you and anyone else who wasn't able to be perfect. \n\nThis sounds like something that started off being a stepping stone on the recovery path, but is now becoming a hurdle. Regardless of what you do, she's not going to get whatever she's looking for from it, so be prepared for the fallout.", "Not going to lie, I'm not sure Rachel is entirely thinking this through.\n\nI'm very happy she's been free of her bulimia/ED for a year, but the stress of RE-CREATING THEIR WEDDING could very well cause her to relapse.\n\nMy sister's friend lived with us for nearly 10 years and she had very bad bulimia/ED (to the extent that she nearly died twice while living with us.) She had stress triggers and we had gotten her to a point where her life was as free from those certain triggers as we could make it. She was about 3 years since her last bulimia relapse when some stuff with her family caused the stress triggers, and she relapsed again. Three YEARS after her last relapse.\n\nThe stress/attention of Rachel's wedding is literally going to be played out AGAIN, to a certain extent. \n\nI'm not saying she'll 100% guaranteed relapse, but if I were her, I would be VERY careful about literally re-doing the wedding in part.\n\nI don't know how you could try to tell your brother that, as it isn't your place to bring that sort of thing up IMO, but I personally would not want to participate in an event that WILL stress your SIL out again and COULD lead to her relapsing.\n\nNTA.", "That alone makes them massive gaping AHs", "Trust me, no one is happy to be doing this for Rachel.", "im pretty certain i can use a deepfake generator to do it for a smallish amount and i have no artistic skill at all you just feed video/photo and headshot into the tool.
