I was in his wedding party as an usher. I didn't know it at the time but Rachel was bulimic. She struggled on and off since she was in college and the stress of the wedding planning and made it out of control. Not long after the wedding Rachel was hospitalized. She went to inpatient rehab for a while. Last week she was one year clean from bulimia.\n\nMy brother said Rachel wants to redo their wedding pictures. I didn't know this was a thing but Rachel had something called bulimia cheeks. I didn't realize it at the wedding. But looking at Rachel now vs. back then it was obvious. My brother said she's embarrassed and hates those photos. I thought he meant that him and Rachel would get dressed up in their wedding clothes and get new photos.\n\nRachel wants not just them, but their immediate families and wedding parties to. She knows she can't get all the guests to come back to do it and the pictures with guests in them will always exist. But she wants the families and wedding party to wear the clothes they wore to the wedding and go to the church and then the banquet hall to redo the pictures. Even the ones of everyone at the altar during the ceremony. I think this is ridiculous.\n\nThe church and the banquet hall are booked up evenings and weekends. So we can only do it on a weekday. I'd have to pay to rent a tux again, drive almost 4 hours one way and spend almost the entire day or at least several hours posing for photos, doing the formal portraits and standing/sitting at the altar of the church and the head table. The church and banquet hall said we have to be out before 12am (church) and 4pm (banquet hall). I would also have to get up before 5am to get there on time. It's worse for the women. They have to pay to get their hair, makeup and nails done the same as they were at the wedding. It's ridiculous.\n\nI love my brother and I wanted to do whatever I could to give him the wedding he wanted. Him and Rachel wanted to save money so the wedding parties helped them a lot. We printed the invitations and printed the envelopes too and stuffed them. They had 364 guests. We made the centerpieces for the tables at the reception. We made Rachel's and the bridesmaid's bouquets. We decorated the banquet hall ourselves and then took them down after the wedding. And about a hundred other things. I didn't complain but it was exhausting. I had use so much time for wedding stuff.\n\nI said I'm not doing it. My brother says I'm being an asshole and this is important to Rachel. He's angry because Rachel got upset I said no. He's putting pressure on me because she's part of the family and was sick back then. I do love Rachel but I don't want to take yet another day off work for this Am I right or is he right that I'm the asshole? I'm asking because a lot of people seem happy to do this for her and think people who aren't are assholes.", "created_utc": 1684032740, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h0j7x/aita_for_not_wanting_to_participate_in_my_brother/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also \u2014 good photoshop skills could probably modify the originals.", "NTA  Yes, it sucks that she was sick back then but you know what? Lots of people are sick on their wedding day.  Some have cancer, some have X, Y, Z. That doesn't mean they get to go back and get a redo on their life at other people's cost and expense because they can't deal with the reality.   \n\nYour SIL and your brother are not being reasonable.  This is NOT a reasonable ask.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know about anyone else but the way they\u2019re going about trying to recreate the moment in photos to pretend she wasn\u2019t sick seems really unhealthy. Like others have said, Photoshop exists. Or do a couples photoshoot. Or bring the whole wedding party but let them dress how they like and take photos in a studio or pretty outdoor venue. This should be about how far she\u2019s come and not rewriting history.", "They need to contact their original photographer and see if it's possible to edit the photos of the bride. That's definitely less expensive than re-creating the wedding! \n\nYou're NTA.", "I am curious what the masses will opine on this one. \n\nMy sympathies go out to you, your brother, and sister-in-law. I can appreciate why she would want new photos. She must have been suffering and to look at the wedding photos must be a painful reminder. She\u2019s not an asshole for the purpose of this forum even though her demands are\u2026 rather extreme. And I get that she\u2019s upset. \n\nYour brother is obviously incorrect, you are  not an asshole, not after the efforts you have already made and the logistics involved for you in participating in the redo. So, NTA, you. \n\nI would say no assholes here except your brother does not qualify. He\u2019s looking out for his wife but taking shots at you, after your efforts, given the demand that\u2019s on the table\u2026 sphincter territory.", "NTA. My heart goes out to your SIL, but this is a huge ask of you and everyone else.", "Your brother and Rachel will always know these are the redo pictures. It isn\u2019t reasonable to ask people to come back on a random weekday at the exact same location.\n\nThey could do this at a reasonable location, maybe over a holiday.

Sorry.\"\n\n\"You are being unreasonable. I have said no. I understand where she is coming from but the answer is still no.\"\n\n\"My answer is no. I have a life to lead just as you do and i have already helped you out enough for your wedding. This is more than I can handle.\"", "NTA It would be a big no from me as well. If the couple wants to redo their photos that\u2019s fine but you have better things to do with your time and money than do fake wedding photos.", "NTA. I would not do this. It's an unreasonable ask. I'm sorry she was sick but retaking these pictures is for what? How often are they going to look at them? You will all know they're reshoots. \n\n364 guests and you all worked your butts off to make that happen. They need to do a vow renewal locally and take pictures of that. They can throw you all a nice little party in exchange for you all dressing up for that.", "This is a really sad situation. Taking a day off to participate in the photoshoot would be a kind thing for you to do. However, it would also be kind of your brother to cover your tux rental. \n\nYou could also ask if they are open to being a big more flexible on what guests can and can\u2019t wear, within reason. For example, a dark suit you already own (not jeans).", "NTA.  I can appreciate her wanting to redo pictures of her and her husband, but the complete recreation of the wedding is extreme and using her illness to hold people emotionally hostage is just another way for mental illness to take control.  This whole thing is not an expression of recovery but finding new ways for her illness to express itself.  When you lose things, you do better to not lose it again.  Honestly, they should wait five years and do a vow renewal and get pictures then.", "NTA\n\nJust because someone wants something doesn't mean they're entitled to it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even considering asking people to do this is pure fucking insanity.\nThe cost to recreate the photos is astronomical and I\u2019m guessing that they\u2019re not offering to cover the price for everyone. Not to mention travel costs. \n\nIt\u2019d be easier to photoshop her out and in the pictures.", "NTA.  Congrats to Rachel for her progress.  But our struggles and our falls make us who we are.  It sounds like she is trying to erase what happened when that seems more dangerous to me.  I think it's totally fine to retake her and her husband because those may be up for display.  But she should keep those old pictures too so she can remember how easy it is to fall.  \n\nI also think it's ridiculous to put everyone out like this.", "NTA. Honestly, to me, it would make more sense for them to renew their vows at 5 years, have a party, and get new pictures. Trying to recreate something to the extent they are is never going to come out the way they want. It's staged pictures, not an actual wedding. Why risk a second disappointment instead of waiting a little while and creating a new set of memories.", "NTA, if she wants it so bad, she needs to pick up the bills for everyone.  How well do you know the women?  For them to take time off work, pay for hair, nails and makeup again.  If the dress does not fit to have it altered.  For the guys to be expected to rent a tux again.  Stick to saying no.  IF there is a group text say why, renting tux, full day off work, long drive there and back.  It may cause others to back out as well.", "NTA that\u2019s a big ask. At this point, it might be better to have the photos professionally edited. Has anybody asked about this possibility?", "Eh, not sure it rises to the level of TA, but I would absolutely have done this for one of my brothers if they were in a similar situation. Yes, it's a big inconvenience, but plenty of things are inconvenient in life - if your family is truly important to you, then suck it up and do it for them.", "I'm going against the grain here. In the lightest possible way YTA. Yes it is absolutely a lot to ask. But this is ONE day. One day of your life to ensure your SIL whom is your family, and you love that she can look at her wedding photos and not feel shame, or regret. I think you could all compromise on some of the details, like getting makeup, hair, and everything exactly the same. But I think it's okay to spare one day. Unless you're in danger of losing your job, then I totally understand not being willing to take the day off work.", "NTA that\u2019s outside the realm of reasonable", "As a photographer I agree that the brother should just pay to have them shopped. If bet they could get the original photographer(s) to do this (I'd do it if they were my clients). Yes, the photographer might need to take some new pics of her to incorporate into the old photos, but at least everyone else can stay home for it. If the photographer they used can't do it, they should be able to find a pro photo editor to do it for them.", "This is it exactly! How far she has come in her life journey! Rewritting history though often tried never really holds up. She can retake new photo's as a celebration of overcoming her challenge but it does not change the fact of what she was! NTA", "Respectfully disagree. In all honesty, it would be much, much better if Rachel simply accepted the fact that she had been sick then, and now she's better. \n\nLet's celebrate that!  Have a new party and celebrate her good health. \n\nIt's almost as if she's trying to pretend that she had never been sick. It's as if they are trying to create an alternate reality that makes what really happened- not exist. \n\nI know some people seem to think that's the way to go, but I do not believe that that is a healthy response.\n\nRecreating those pictures is a ridiculous waste of time and energy, and I am completely with OP. He is NTA.", "not exactly \u201cone day\u201d when these people already had a wedding day ( when they already relied heavily on their loved ones to plan the wedding*)  \u2026.", "We had family pictures done a while ago, and the photographer did a head swap on a picture I otherwise loved but my husband looked a little \u2026 goofy \u2026 in. Afterward it was perfect. No one would know his head was from a totally different image.", "If it were me I'd have someone digitally alter the photos. And I agree with a new party, that's a great idea.", "They aren't re-planning the wedding though. One day. Take some pictures. You do a huge solid for your loved ones. You say this like one day is all people get to rely on family.", "One day and a shit ton of money. No. Unless the families are millionaires that can spare the expenses.", "That's why I said there should be compromises on having everything exactly the same. Like I said above, if it were me I'd have a professional digitally alter the photos. So I agree with you that spending all that money is a no. But that doesn't mean it needs to be a hard no to everything"]}
