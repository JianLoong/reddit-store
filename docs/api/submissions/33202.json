NTA darlin. Though it is true, by federal law men have a few, FEW, less rights at the moment and it needs to change. Equal rights across the board, and socially things are tough because change is tough and people need to learn to be better to one another. It's not wrong for him to stand for men's rights but the problem is it doesn't do any better to downplay what women go through. BOTH have it tough and he's being petty... seriously, anemia is a serious thing to have, \"men have it harder\" is no where near the sphere of conversion regarding someone having anemia. Which by the way I am sorry you're suffering that, hon. Hope it gets better for ya. Again, NOT... THE... AHOLE", "My only thought is good for you.

If you catch my drift.", "NTA at all. Everybody has their own struggles, but your brother seemed to put other men that he doesnt even know above you and your struggles. \n\nYour mom should have told him to STFU too.", "NTA. Your brother could have spoken up about harassment of men and the relative lack of sympathy towards male victims, without saying \"it's not so bad\" when referring to female victims. There was no need to dismiss women's problems like that.", "Some people are so low in self-esteem they need to hate on others in order to feel good about themselves. Your brother seems to be one of them. It's easier to hate others than to have to do some self-reflection into why it is they're unhappy, or why people don't like them. \n\nInstead of trying to reason with him, I suggest making a show of pitying him. Whenever he starts going off, make comments like \"it's so sad to see you hate yourself so much that you have to hate on others in order to feel better\", or \"it's such a shame your self-worth is tied to how much you can blame others for your problems\".\n\nIt won't solve anything, but it could be fun to see the different shades of red his face turns.

You rightly acknowledged sometimes men have it harder too.\n\nWe don't choose when we get to breaking point. Unfortunate timing but not your fault at all.\n\nI'd tell hin to stfu too. Maybe if one of your parents had done it when it started you wouldn't have had to.", "NTA.  Unlike women walking down the street in revealing clothing, he was asking for it.", "NTA, your brother needs to stop consuming red pill content and grow the fuck up, the target audience for this kind of brainrot are 15 year olds, he's way too old to actually put stock in this kind of thinking.", "I would suggest trying something along the lines of, \"No, Sweetie, you want to know why men sometimes have a shit time of it? Because people like you get all into how oppressed they are, but then use it only to shit on others and negate any criticism. If life as a man is that bad, do something about it. Volunteer. Write to a senator. Start asking your mates about their feelings. There's plenty you can do but you don't, and you won't. That's why.\"", "NTA. He probably needed to stfu. \nBut I do wanna point out, this is exactly how men felt when women fell down the women\u2019s right rabbit hole a few years ago. Like literally verbatim of what you said in your post lol.", "NTA.", "NTA, your brother sounds like the insufferable epitome of toxic masculinity. Keep an eye on that one and start recording the shit he says. Send it to every girlfriend he has. Protect women from him at any cost. He sounds like Elliot Rodger and Brock Turner are his role models. \n\nAs a married woman waking up in her femininity, I can acknowledge that men struggle through things quietly and in ways women don\u2019t always see. I know he has his own difficulties and I try to be aware of it so I can empathize with him. Men and women have painful experiences that the other can never fully comprehend. But a real man will never diminish what difficulties a woman has nor be vocal about them like your brother is.", "Definitely NTA... it sounds as if your brother has discovered the Andrew Tate rabbit hole. If he starts banging on about how Chess is a great metaphor for life then bingo !!!\n\nIf this is a pretty recent thing then he is probably going through his 'newly enlightened' stage where he feels he needs to preach what he has 'learned' to anyone who will listen... IE... he's become a bore :)", "NTA \n\nHe can believe what he wants but he has to be prepared for the reactions to his bs. Maybe your mother should sit down with him and set him straight instead of blaming you for reacting appropriately.", "~~ESH~~  \n\n~~he's clearly feeling left out of society, and probably your female dominated family, but snapping at people because the world's not fair only contributes to... more unfairness. you shouldn't scream at people for the same reason.~~\n\n~~your outburst at him, coming from a woman in a group discussion about women is only going to reinforce his shit. something about \"shut the fuck up\" tells me you havent engaged with much empathy~~\n\nbased on further comments, NTA", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's in a political gray area though, and you might not like some of his other stances on things, he can be unpopular.

I asked if he's ever had an experience like that, or what he thought, and if he had anything to add. He just gave one word answers and looked at his phone. \n\nI blew up because people were sharing tough stories, it was kind of an emotional conversation, and he gave a very rude response. \n\nI know I probably shouldn't have, but I was kinda at the end of my rope.", "unfortunately you do seriously have to have ironclad patience to get people out of things like redpill, the ideology thrives on confrontation. Any kind of pushback or resistance they get from women reinforces the whole system that they're victims, women are manipulative, etc... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will definitely change my opinion here though, if he was being a little shit the whole time while people were opening up, he definitely had it coming lol."]}
