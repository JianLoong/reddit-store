And people who are interested in getting them done should not have financial expectations of others. Worst case scenario: You help her financially and she is unhappy with the result or something goes wrong.", "NTA...\n\nIt sounds like this girl has some issues...\n\nAnd the whole thing started with her giving you a \"pity date\"...?  Jeez dude...\n\nNo offense but you should probably call off the engagement and head for the hills...\n\nThis sounds like the kind of girl that's gonna end up cheating on you the second she runs into a tall rich dude that'll buy her new tits...\n\nUnless you can get her into some therapy I don't see this situation ending well...", "NTA. Her parents are only trying to get you to pay so they don't have to.", "NTA. Doing to much seems excessive and there are so many risks. Especially for anything regarding the face. My friend's friend just had something done and my friend is horrified.", "NTA. Tell her save up. It's an I want. Not a must have.", "NTA completely for me. I can possibly see some AHishness if the surgery was to correct, I don't know, scarring or something like that, but lip filler? Trying to look \"more beautiful\" is way different from someone's attempt to correct something that's \"really\" wrong. Even with that, I'd never say you should be forced to pay for something, so it would highly depend on what the surgery would be to me before I'd move into AH territory.", "NTA\n\nLip augmentation is *disgusting*.", "Nah, 31 is beautiful, as is 40,50,60 to 100. So is gray hair. She needs to take Justine Batemans advice for young women. Get off social media and rock your age and your looks. No need to try to turn back time.", "NTA.  No, you aren't responsible for her elective cosmetic surgery, and tbh I think she needs mental health help if she \"needs\" surgery to feel better about herself in the absence of a significant deformity of some kind.  Addiction to plastic surgery is a thing.", "NTA\n\nYou find her attractive. You find her beautiful. You have told her time and time again she is absolutely beautiful in your eyes. Yes she can and has influence from the fake world of instagram. 90% of those people are photoshopped, starved, or otherwise fake or harmed to get that appearance. They are not well.\n\nYes. It is valid to explain to her you were in a similar situation, and now (I assume) feel better about yourself. asking her to do self reflection is not a bad idea. Some people can feel defensive because if they start reflecting, then they might open doors they didn\u2019t want to see behind. Perhaps this could be partly why she doesn\u2019t?\n\nPlus, cosmetic surgery can be expensive. It sounds as though she wants to get multiple as well. That isn\u2019t fair of you to help her when she won\u2019t accept her own beauty. When will the surgeries be enough? They probably won\u2019t be.\n\nNo. You\u2019re not the asshole. Yes, self reflection is good. I would just talk to her and explain that you find her beautiful, instagram is fake, and confidence will come.", "NTA.  Reconsider whether you want your finances legally tied to someone who is so obsessed with their appearance that they're opting for unnecessary surgeries.  This dissatisfaction isn't ever going to go away.  The results of these surgeries rarely meet expectations, and your fiancee will always find something else in need of correction.  Consider finding someone who didn't date you out of pity and stay for the money.  Your fiancee's ambition is to be a trophy wife, and I don't get the impression that you want one of those.", "NTA,  Its not like she was asking for help in paying the car insurance, this need to turn yourself into a plastic Barbie is not healthy and she probably has other issues that cosmetic surgery isn't going to fix,  And running to her Mommy to tell on you....WOW!!!  Buddy you have your work cut out for you, Good Luck!", "NTA. If this were a medically necessary surgery, it would be different. But these are very expensive elective cosmetic surgeries. Now there's absolutely nothing wrong with cosmetic surgeries. If it makes her feel better and more confident about herself, she should get the surgery and you should support her decision. But it shouldn't come at your expense. The fact that she threw a fit at you for not wanting to pay thousands of dollars for a surgery that she just wants and doesn't need seems a little unhinged. Sounds like she needs therapy, not cosmetic surgeries.", "NTA", "NTA. Women are naturally beautiful. All these augmentations are distracting and sad in a way. The only thing you could\u2019ve done better, is tell her how much you love the natural her.", "NAH\n\nnot your responsibility to pay for someone else's cosmetic procedures, even just in part and even tho you're married\n\nechoing what others have said to help support her to feel more confident - I personally got a lot happier when I didn't follow or see beautiful women on socials (subreddits like instagramreality helped too). saw yr comment about therapy n socials which are good first suggestions, but might be nice if you showed how you think she's gorgeous in other ways if you dont already. when you're with someone a while, it can often go unsaid - maybe continue show how you think she's beautiful in meaningful ways she'll appreciate\n\nI do think you could have been kinder when she said you don't know what it's like - tbh you don't know what it's like to be a woman and have certain expectations regarding a woman's appearance.", "This is a little more complex than I originally thought. Couple of thoughts:\n\n1. You tell her to work on her self confidence. Have you tried offering to help her? I know it must come from the inside, but there are more than enough tricks that you can remind her of. Self confidence is very much a matter of \"fake it til you make it\"\n2. INFO: Cosmetic Surgery can be a slippery slope. Does she often use makeup, try to to keep on top of trends etc?\n3. I have seen more than enough cases where a little cosmetic help has transformed a person's confidence\n4. You really do not know what it's like. Women are under a lot more societal pressure to look good etc. and it's much more work for them to distance themselves from The Gaze.\n\nAll in all, NAH, leaning a slight YTA because you seem to rather harshly do away with how she feels.", "Let\u2019s be honest with each other and call a spade a spade: if you really thought she was gorgeous as is, you\u2019d tell her that and not help enable her belief she needs plastic surgery.", "I think it depends on what your finances are like. \n\nIf your money is combined and everything is split 50/50, then yes, you're kind of the AH. It's not fair for you to tell her that she can't spend money on things because you disagree with it. I'm sure you buy things that she would find useless. I would also say it depends on if you guys can afford the surgeries. I would say she is selfish if her getting lip injections comes before putting food on the table. \n\nIf you have separate finances and she just wants you to front her money to pay for expensive surgeries, then I would say that is a red flag. Especially if she won't help you pay for anything that is important to you.", "Very soft YTA, because you do have a point about source of healthy self-confidence, and she\u2019s not there yet. But. You\u2019re telling her that her desires are invalid. That\u2019s kinda crappy. Maybe tell her that the most important thing for you is that she feels happy and confident. And while cosmetic surgery can do that for some people, others regret the choice afterwards. Ask her if she\u2019d consider working with a therapist to uncover the reasons she feels bad about herself, and tell her that if she still feels that these procedures are the best choice for her afterwards, you\u2019ll participate in the cost.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Cosmetic surgery is a personal choice, as well as a personal expense.  The only time I don't think that is in the cases of breast cancer or life effecting scaring.

I also had a big nose (that is a familial trait).\n\nMy husband has offered to pay to have my stomach muscles tightened so that I have a flat stomach - being pregnant had caused it (so he felt partly responsible) and it wasn\u2019t \u201csomething I was born with\u201d. \n\nHe NEVER offered to pay to have my nose reduced as that is \u201cpurely cosmetic\u201d (I had a bad accident and shattered my nose - it didn\u2019t heal properly and I ended up getting a nose job on the NHS so it is now smaller anyway).

It USED to be that before cosmetic surgery for \"enhancement\" (as opposed to reconstruction) you DID have to seek help from a therapist first.  This was way back in the 70's before cosmetic surgery became de rigeuer and flaunted by practically everyone who is \"anyone\" (note: we are ALL SOMEBODY and have value and worth).  You may want to ask her why she is refusing to seek therapy, it's a valid question.  If she is having self esteem issues because she is comparing herself to all the people on insta, maybe pull up some kind of report that shows how photoshopped all those pictures actually are.  Even without photoshop, there are still a lot of filters people use that can change the way the photos look.  She needs to understand that REAL people are NOT photos, and social media IS NOT REAL LIFE, it is merely a PROJECTION of what people WANT YOU TO SEE.  Self worth is not defined by how photogenic someone is, nor is it defined BY OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS.  I really hope she can understand this, it's really sad that people compare themselves like this and it's poisoning so many people inside and it's not even REAL.", "While this is obviously true, I care about my partner\u2019s desires, because I love them. It\u2019s a part of being in a healthy relationship, in my opinion.", "Someone seeking cosmetic surgery in an effort to recieve external validation from others isn't exactly part of a healthy relationship either"]}
