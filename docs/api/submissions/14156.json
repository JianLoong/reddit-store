I can possibly see some AHishness if the surgery was to correct, I don't know, scarring or something like that, but lip filler? Trying to look \"more beautiful\" is way different from someone's attempt to correct something that's \"really\" wrong. Even with that, I'd never say you should be forced to pay for something, so it would highly depend on what the surgery would be to me before I'd move into AH territory.", "NTA\n\nLip augmentation is *disgusting*.", "Nah, 31 is beautiful, as is 40,50,60 to 100. So is gray hair. She needs to take Justine Batemans advice for young women. Get off social media and rock your age and your looks. No need to try to turn back time.", "NTA.  No, you aren't responsible for her elective cosmetic surgery, and tbh I think she needs mental health help if she \"needs\" surgery to feel better about herself in the absence of a significant deformity of some kind.  Addiction to plastic surgery is a thing.", "NTA\n\nYou find her attractive. You find her beautiful. You have told her time and time again she is absolutely beautiful in your eyes. Yes she can and has influence from the fake world of instagram. 90% of those people are photoshopped, starved, or otherwise fake or harmed to get that appearance. They are not well.\n\nYes. It is valid to explain to her you were in a similar situation, and now (I assume) feel better about yourself. asking her to do self reflection is not a bad idea. Some people can feel defensive because if they start reflecting, then they might open doors they didn\u2019t want to see behind. Perhaps this could be partly why she doesn\u2019t?\n\nPlus, cosmetic surgery can be expensive. It sounds as though she wants to get multiple as well. That isn\u2019t fair of you to help her when she won\u2019t accept her own beauty. When will the surgeries be enough? They probably won\u2019t be.\n\nNo. You\u2019re not the asshole. Yes, self reflection is good. I would just talk to her and explain that you find her beautiful, instagram is fake, and confidence will come.", "NTA.  Reconsider whether you want your finances legally tied to someone who is so obsessed with their appearance that they're opting for unnecessary surgeries.  This dissatisfaction isn't ever going to go away.  The results of these surgeries rarely meet expectations, and your fiancee will always find something else in need of correction.

Buddy you have your work cut out for you, Good Luck!", "NTA. If this were a medically necessary surgery, it would be different. But these are very expensive elective cosmetic surgeries. Now there's absolutely nothing wrong with cosmetic surgeries. If it makes her feel better and more confident about herself, she should get the surgery and you should support her decision. But it shouldn't come at your expense. The fact that she threw a fit at you for not wanting to pay thousands of dollars for a surgery that she just wants and doesn't need seems a little unhinged.

Couple of thoughts:\n\n1. You tell her to work on her self confidence. Have you tried offering to help her? I know it must come from the inside, but there are more than enough tricks that you can remind her of. Self confidence is very much a matter of \"fake it til you make it\"\n2. INFO: Cosmetic Surgery can be a slippery slope. Does she often use makeup, try to to keep on top of trends etc?\n3. I have seen more than enough cases where a little cosmetic help has transformed a person's confidence\n4. You really do not know what it's like. Women are under a lot more societal pressure to look good etc. and it's much more work for them to distance themselves from The Gaze.\n\nAll in all, NAH, leaning a slight YTA because you seem to rather harshly do away with how she feels.", "Let\u2019s be honest with each other and call a spade a spade: if you really thought she was gorgeous as is, you\u2019d tell her that and not help enable her belief she needs plastic surgery.", "I think it depends on what your finances are like. \n\nIf your money is combined and everything is split 50/50, then yes, you're kind of the AH. It's not fair for you to tell her that she can't spend money on things because you disagree with it. I'm sure you buy things that she would find useless. I would also say it depends on if you guys can afford the surgeries. I would say she is selfish if her getting lip injections comes before putting food on the table. \n\nIf you have separate finances and she just wants you to front her money to pay for expensive surgeries, then I would say that is a red flag. Especially if she won't help you pay for anything that is important to you.", "Very soft YTA, because you do have a point about source of healthy self-confidence, and she\u2019s not there yet. But. You\u2019re telling her that her desires are invalid. That\u2019s kinda crappy. Maybe tell her that the most important thing for you is that she feels happy and confident. And while cosmetic surgery can do that for some people, others regret the choice afterwards. Ask her if she\u2019d consider working with a therapist to uncover the reasons she feels bad about herself, and tell her that if she still feels that these procedures are the best choice for her afterwards, you\u2019ll participate in the cost.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It USED to be that before cosmetic surgery for \"enhancement\" (as opposed to reconstruction) you DID have to seek help from a therapist first.  This was way back in the 70's before cosmetic surgery became de rigeuer and flaunted by practically everyone who is \"anyone\" (note: we are ALL SOMEBODY and have value and worth).  You may want to ask her why she is refusing to seek therapy, it's a valid question.  If she is having self esteem issues because she is comparing herself to all the people on insta, maybe pull up some kind of report that shows how photoshopped all those pictures actually are.  Even without photoshop, there are still a lot of filters people use that can change the way the photos look.  She needs to understand that REAL people are NOT photos, and social media IS NOT REAL LIFE, it is merely a PROJECTION of what people WANT YOU TO SEE.  Self worth is not defined by how photogenic someone is, nor is it defined BY OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS.  I really hope she can understand this, it's really sad that people compare themselves like this and it's poisoning so many people inside and it's not even REAL.", "While this is obviously true, I care about my partner\u2019s desires, because I love them.

She can go surgery and still be insecure.\nI'm not sure but for having cosmetic/platisc surgery they need a psycologist evaluation precisely saying the person is psycologically ok to have surgery.

There's no reason for you to help someone you're not married to with elective, cosmetic surgery.", "NTA.\n\nSetting the money issue aside, if the confidence problems and the want for cosmetic surgery  is recent, it might be a good idea to slow down a bit and consider other options, before jumping into anything irreversible. Many images in Instagram are altered and set an impossible standard, and it could be that the surgeries may not actually resolve the body-image issues but make them worse.\n\nI would advise your girlfriend to postpone the surgeries for a year, and take that time to both save some money and work on the confidence issues (possibly with a therapist) so that if/when she ends up getting the surgeries they will be the icing on the cake, and not the cake itself. In the meantime, she can experiment with less invasive options like fillers or permanent make-up.", "NTA tell her if you wanted to play with plastic you would have bought a barbie doll. she is beautiful enough for you and doesn't need to change any thing on her", "Nope.

Small changes in your appearance are not going to make you a better or happier person.

No amount of surgery will make her a beautiful person.", "NTA: You\u2019re spot that she should take some time away from social media and do some real self work before going in for elective surgeries and procedures. I\u2019ve been put through the ringer with non elective surgeries and procedures and any sort is not to be taken lightly. A lot of folks underestimate the recovery process and the risks.

Like, a little cosmetic work might be good.  But lots of alterations piled on top of each other just looks unnatural (think Madonna at the recent Grammys).\n\nSo, no, your fiancee's plans for a lot of cosmetic work probably won't work well in the long term.  And it won't solve her underlying mental health issues.\n\nGiven the fact that your fiancee tattled to her parents and that they are hassling you, you should probably put any wedding planning on hold.
