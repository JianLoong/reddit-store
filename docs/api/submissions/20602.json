It\u2019s nice enough. My parents and dad take the main bedroom, and my sisters (21f and 23f) and me (25m) each have our own rooms.  \nWell this year my dad invited our grandma to come with us (didn\u2019t consult the family before doing so). She\u2019s had some health issues lately so he\u2019s trying to spend more time with her, which I totally get. But here\u2019s the problem.  \nHe wants to put her in my bedroom. I have always stayed in the guest house (right off the main house) since I don\u2019t get along with my sisters and need space. My dad thinks his mom should have my room since it\u2019s the only one that has a private bathroom. That means I need to sleep on the pull out couch in the living room, which offers 0 privacy and is uncomfortable.  \nObviously I have a huge issue with this. My parents told me to speak to my sisters about figuring out an arrangement that seems fair to all of us since \u201cwe\u2019re all adults.\u201d But my sisters are total brats and will not agree to give up their rooms.  \nMy suggestions were that either they put my grandma on the couch since she probably doesn\u2019t care and will be happy just to be invited to our family vacation. Or that my parents give up their bedroom since they were the ones who invited her and not me. When I told my dad this, he told me that since he pays for the trips, he makes the rules, and if I don\u2019t like it, I should go on my own vacation. I\u2019m unable to work due to anxiety issues and he knows I can\u2019t afford to pay for my own vacation. I told him that and he said \u201cwell you don\u2019t have to go then!\u201d I found that very disrespectful since I think everyone deserves to have a vacation!

I have a friend who can work but absolutely refuses to drive.

Everyone else drives her to places, or she spends a ton of money on Uber (really bad public transportation in our city). \n\nShe's tried therapy but doesn't want the meds.

Not wanting to pursue help because other people enable the disability is real. Bills need to be paid somehow. It's possible OP lives at home, and the parents aren't pushing him to seek help. Dad pays for everyone's vacation.

I appreciate it.\n\nHowever, when you're telling the story of your friend, I'm not seeing it in the same way. You say that she's refusing to work on herself, but then you list all the things she's trying. Isn't it still working on yourself if it doesn't work out? She tried driver's ed, but it didn't work for her. She tried medication, but it didn't work. She tried therapy, but telehealth didn't work. She tried again but it was too expensive, and the negatives of outdoor therapy outweighed the positives. Even though none of those things worked, she still tried them. To me, that says that she was working on herself, but realized her capabilities just don't match what the expectations of her are. If she can still function and live in a way that is fulfilling, does it really matter that she needs a little extra help to do so? \n\nI think that forcing people into doing things that they don't have the capacity for is a recipe for disaster. If a person is asked to carry a weight that's above their limit, they may be able to do so for short stretches, but doing so on a long term basis may very well result in an injury that ends up being more debilitating for them than if they never carried the heavier weight to begin with. I think it's the same for mental disabilities. \n\nI don't think that giving a person with a mental illness the help that they need is enabling. It's just taking care of them. At the same time, a person with a debilitating mental illness can contribute in other ways than what is standard. Someone with debilitating social anxiety may be able to take care of household chores. Someone with clinical depression may be able to be a good listener when you need them, or be able to tell a great story. There are ways that people carry weight in their communities that are not directly seen.\n\nThere are also a lot of different ways that things like anxiety manifest. Maybe OP's anxiety is specifically related to social interactions. At that point, maybe a vacation isn't anxiety inducing because he can still spend a lot of time alone, but in a different location. You just don't know, you know?\n\nI think it's a mistake to assume OP is lying or over exaggerating about his disability just because he's an ass. You can be an asshole with anxiety the same way you can be an asshole without it. He's just a person, anxiety or not. In fact, I think being anxious about your sleeping space and being asked to sleep in a common area may very well make someone with anxiety act like an ass. He's more worried about his own comfort than his sick grandma's, which makes him an asshole, but his idea of comfort is so specific BECAUSE of his mental illness. He's anxious. He's also being rude. Both of those things can be true. \n\nI just think that assuming someone must be faking or exaggerating an illness because they're acting selfish is a dangerous thing to do. It leaves room to discriminate against people for being the \"wrong\" kind of disabled.", "Have you ever gone through the process of applying for disability payments? It's really not as simple as filling out a form and then suddenly getting paid, especially for a mental health issue. I'm US based, so I can only speak to that, but applications take a long time to process. I've seen estimates of eight months just to review paperwork that you were, by the way, only given two weeks to complete. On top of that, mental health disability claims are usually rejected on the first go around, which means you have to get a lawyer to file for a review. All of that is INCREDIBLY stressful, which can be hard or even prohibitive for someone struggling with anxiety. \n\nAnd even if you DO get approved, it's for a paltry amount, definitely not enough to live on your own, AND you're not allowed to save more than $2000 dollars at a time. How do you save for a deposit on an apartment? Or for if you experience sudden car trouble? Or, in this case, for a vacation?\n\nI'd also like to point out that NOWHERE in the post does OP say he's NOT getting disability payments. And even if he's not, does the government really have the final say on what constitutes a disability? If you're disabled, you're disabled, regardless of whether its \"official.\" You're making a ton of assumptions based on nothing. \n\nAnd yes, OP is an asshole.

How people respond to anxiety is varried, just like how people's response to anger can be varried. There is no one standard way that people respond. There are responses that are more common, and there are responses that are less common. OP is expressing his anxiety in a way that reads as entitlement. He's wrong to do so, but that doesn't mean that he's not anxious. Being worried about sleeping in a common space, or worrying about sharing with your sisters who are mean to you, are both things OP does because he is presumably feeling anxious. Deciding that there's no solution that benefits him and therefore someone else should suffer is what makes him an asshole. \n\nOf course, I don't actually know OP, so I can't say for sure.

Long story short, she's told us that she doesn't drive because everyone else will drive her around, so she doesn't want to bother with it. That was a while ago, and we've all dropped the subject at this point. \n\n\nGenuinely great person. She's a fantastic member of the community. Anxiety has not won in the majority of her life. It's just the driving thing at this point. \n\nCBT therapy is so important because it allows the individual to reframe their thoughts and see that not everything is bad and world-ending. It takes a lot of hard work and conscious efforts on both the client and the therapist for this to work.\n\nExposure therapy has helped so many people because when we face the fears we have, we see that there is life after the fear, that the fear isn't as bad as we've created it to be, and that the fear isn't going to kill us (and for clarity bc this is the internet, this is only used for things like listening to barking dogs or go through a crowded room, getting rid of a fear of deadly animals should not be worked through via exposure therapy).\n\nWhen someone has anxiety, it's so easy for everything to feel worse immediately. My therapist has to really work through my fears and my anxieties because once that anxiety wins, it's really difficult to climb back up and out. It's how you eventually have a depression apartment where utensils haven't been cleaned for weeks and you have no clean clothes. You need to make a conscious effort because that's how fighting mental illness works sometimes. \n\nIt sucks and it's unfortunate, but when we choose not to do anything about it, the mental illness wins. \n\nI'm not a licensed anything at all. I really can't make a diagnosis from anything in this post. Something that we can all agree on is that too many people simplify a lot of really complicated mental illnesses to explain certain behaviors. (\"I need to make sure that I do my make-up every morning because I'm really OCD about it.\"\" Or \"ugh, she's such a narcissist. If you don't ask her how her weekend was, she'll be annoyed.\" That's what I mean. Co-occuring disorders exist, but lots of symptoms present themselves in multiple things. I thought my obsession with making sure the doors were locked was ADHD because I felt like I was doing too many things that i forgot to check the door, but in reality, it's anxiety.)\n\nMaking reasonable accommodations and ensuring that someone doesn't have an anxiety attack or a panic attack is helping them, and it's great and obligatory. \n\nBut again, there's usually less entitlement with someone who has that level of debilitating anxiety. Yes, someone with anxiety can definitely be a jerk.  \n\nIf the anxiety is socially based, then yeah, a vacation could be debilitating. Being away from their safe space. Having to be around family that he doesn't have a good relationship with. Maybe that guestroom was the solution, and now the solution is gone. Okay, either suck it up or stay home. There is no other reasonable accommodation in that situation. You either need to sleep on the couch or stay home. \n\nIt's just the way everything is written and phrased in his post. Had he said, \"I can't work, I have really bad anxiety. I've tried to get disability and the process is a nightmare.\" Okay, I'd buy that. \"I have really bad anxiety. I either can't hold down a job or showing up the first day is triggering.\" I'd buy that too. \n\nThere's usually humility, and I'm not seeing that here. Dude just seems like an asshole who is using a mental illness to excuse bad behavior. \n\nI could be totally off base (and I hope I am). I'm not a licensed anything. I work in HR, and we require a ton of documentation for accommodations, so I'm used to paper trails. He just gives off bad vibes.\n\nIt's the complete lack of self-awareness that make me think he's an entitled prick who has been handed everything in life and doesn't want to work because he's never had to and now work is an inconvenience for him.\n\nAgain, I could be off base, and I hope I am.", "You know, I think we actually have very similar viewpoints. \n\nIt's just that I think that it's never a guarantee that someone with a disability acts the way you expect them to. You know, maybe you buy a homeless person McDonald's and expect them to be grateful but they throw a fit instead. Doesn't mean they don't need help, or that they're not being an asshole, but it could mean that they really need something else, and their experiences are causing them to lash out. Maybe they really need a blanket, but no one will give them cash because they assume they'll spend it on drugs, so they can't get a blanket. If you buy them McDonald's, it doesn't satisfy that need. They're still cold. You just never know.\n\nI think there are people with anxiety who can't show humility. They just don't have the self awareness. People can have other comorbid illnesses that could prevent an accurate understanding of themselves. Or they could just be young! Is there a young person out there who truly understands themself?\n\nWithout knowing OP, I can't say either way. Based on this post, he hasn't done anything particularly horrific. He's just asked for an accomadation that is wrong to expect. He's not being considerate. He's being a jerk. He could still be disabled, however.\n\nMy issue with the original comment is that it seems like the commenter expects that OP can work while disabled exactly like they can, and that by not doing so, OP is putting his family in an awful position. OP could just as well be genuinely disabled and unable to work. It really doesn't matter in the question of whether he's being an asshole. However, to say that because he's being an asshole, he can't be disabled hurts disabled people as a whole. Should \"being nice\" be a necessary qualification to get food from a food bank? Who are the people proving that you're nice? Is there any bias based on something you cant control anywhere? It just feels wrong to expect.\n\nBut again, I think we're mostly viewing things the same way. I'm just giving OP more benefit of the doubt than you are haha", "love your responses!!!", "No he said he doesn\u2019t get along with his sister and wants his elderly grandmother to sleep on a fold out so he can enjoy privacy and luxury at his parents expense. This ain\u2019t anxiety by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nAnxiety isn\u2019t a mental disability. You said yourself \u201cit\u2019s an emotion\u201d. \n\nRegardless of whether OP has it or not, it\u2019s hardly appropriate to label it the cause for his behaviour. He literally explained why he didn\u2019t want to give up the room and only mentioned anxiety at the end when trying to defend his unemployment.", "You are so incredibly wrong, and in such a way that it makes it hard for me to view your comment as anything but facetious.  Anxiety IS the cause of OP's behavior.  You're also twisting my words. I'm not going to entertain this comment further than that. Try considering other people's viewpoints instead of just your own. \n\nAnxiety is a mental disability. You're just an asshole."]}
