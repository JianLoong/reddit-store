Ex has not been involved in Mackenzie\u2019s life since she was 3 months old. She lost parental rights when Mackenzie was 1. Shortly after, I met my now wife. She has 2 girls from a previous marriage, Alyssa (8) and Josie (5). We got married a year later and my wife adopted Mackenzie.\n\nMy wife is the type to post everything on social media. Alyssa and Josie\u2019s dad is an ass who is barely around. She constantly drags him on Facebook and goes into excruciating detail on him. She also shares every small detail of Alyssa and Josie\u2019s lives, the good, the bad, etc. Even stuff that makes them look bad, like tantrums or bad days. I\u2019ve told her before I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. She waves it off as they don\u2019t have social media. I set the boundary early that she not do that with Mackenzie. For awhile, she respected it.\n\nMackenzie\u2019s bio mom recently started causing some trouble. She doesn\u2019t want to see her but is doing some other stuff that\u2019s frustrating for both myself and my wife. We have been in family and couples counseling to help us blend the families, which helps. \n\nMy wife recently began venting about my ex on Facebook. She started going into great detail about the reasons she lost custody. I told her several times I do not feel comfortable with Mackenzie\u2019s story being out there without her consent. My wife and I went back and forth on this. Even the therapist told her this wasn\u2019t healthy. So, my wife deleted it. \n\nLast week, we got the good news that the court granted our request for a restraining order against my ex. The next day, I see my wife was posting about this, once again sharing all the terrible things my ex had done. I told her to delete it. She said she would. When I went on her profile last night, it was still up. We share an iPad and it was logged onto her  Facebook. I deleted the post and let her know I had done so. She got mad and said I had no right to delete anything off her account. I told her she can vent to friends, family, me, the therapist, etc but I do not want this story out there. I told her if it happened again, I\u2019d report her.\n\nShe grumpily agreed she\u2019d never do it again but said I\u2019m censoring her.

Your wife needs to mature quite a bit.", "NTA. Airing private family business like that, especially when it's really not your business to share it, is just plain trashy. Your wife is showing that she has no respect for your boundaries.", "NTA. All that info can, and probably will, sadly, be used against your family!", "NTA. She seems to continually violate your boundaries regarding your daughter. You need to talk to her about that and she needs to start respecting them before it causes a larger issue.", "NTA. Lol, censoring her???? She needs to get a grip.\n\nIt's super unhealthy to feel the need to post everything going on in your life on social media. Even social media influencers that make a ton of money doing share their *entire* lives. Just blips of it. Because that's healthy. Perhaps suggest a SM break to her? And a hobby lol.", "NTA, and yes, you are censoring her, as you should. You should stay in counseling with your wife and, and bring up her dangerous addiction to posting personal stuff on facebook every single time. She needs to STOP.", "NTA, I know someone who does this with their kids and I always felt like it'd be embarrassing for the kids if they ever get their own facebook/are told about it when they're older. No one wants their private business blasted on facebook.", "NTA.  This is your story to tell, not your wife's.  \n\nLet's face it...  when we post on FB, we're looking for attention.  How many likes.. how many comments, etc.  It's really sad that she is using your daughter's story to seek attention for herself.", "NTA. She needs to respect those boundaries because they are completely justified.  Some things should not be shared with hundreds of other people. Yikes.", "I'd usually say y t a, but in this case it's an easy NTA.\n\nIt was a post about your ex and about your daughter. You have been clear on the boundaries and she insists on breaking them.\n\nBtw, it's possible she does it again being more careful not to leave the account logged off. You can report the post to facebook. I don't know how long it takes for them to act but hopefully not very long.\n\nAnd you need to have a (another) deeper conversation with her (maybe with the therapist as well). At this point it's not even a matter of whether it's healthy or not. It's not her dirty laundry to wash online.", "NTA but threatening her with being reported is stepping right up to the line. \n\nNone of the kids' lives should be up on social media. It's silly and dangerous. I never understood why people feel the need to post their lives on social media, but I guess your wife is one of the people that do. You need to draw a line with all the children. Not just m. If you make the argument about all of the children it has more impact. Not just your bio daughter.", "NTA. She\u2019s a massive idiot. Posting all details of your kids life on social media is asking for trouble. As is dragging your ex, whom you are in court with. \n\nNext time she does it close her damn account and really teach her a lesson.", "My mom has always been one of those people who thinks their kids' lives are theirs to share.  Before social media, thank goodness, but it's still annoying.  If I want someone to know that particular private thing *I'll* tell them.\n\nThe result of this will be that her children will stop telling her private things.  \n\nI know you say you don't have a say when it comes to the steps, but I assume the therapist is advising her not to do these things.  Holding her accountable to the advice of a therapist that you are seeing together is something you can and should do.", "NTA. Your wife is posting every bit of the kids' lives online. In the future, this can lead to resentment and unsafe situations from and for your kids. This is not a healthy way to release frustration, and it disrespects your boundaries.\n\nShe is the AH here.", "Whooooboy, you have a problem. Your wife has NO RIGHT to share the lives of your daughters, any of them, on social media. This is violating their privacy. I\u2019m fully aware parents can do whatever they want but just because she can, does not mean she should.\n\nYour step daughters will eventually get social media, it\u2019s inevitable. Your wife will be lucky if her daughters stay in contact with her after they turn 18. NTA", "NTA- Your personal life is not your wife\u2019s fodder for internet clout. She can suffer the consequences of putting her children in the internet in a little over a decade when they don\u2019t talk to her anymore. The next time she brings your daughter into it, consider divorce since the therapist isn\u2019t someone she listens to. Your daughter comes first.", "NTA\n\nYou set your boundaries and she disrespected them. She knows you don't want any posts on your daughter, so when she did post about your daughter, you have every right to delete it.", "NTA. She is an annoying over sharer on facebook. While I often enjoy indulging in the drama these type of people post, I also have a lot of second hand embarrassment for them. I wouldn\u2019t put up with this either. She probably needs to quit social media altogether for a while to reset her brain.", "NTA. She's using social media to share stories about other people's lives, not her own. These stories are damaging or embarrassing to those people, not to her, so she's being very rude and disrespectful. There's something very wrong with your wife that she can't recognise the difference between what is acceptable to show the public, and what she needs to keep private (i.e amongst loved ones), or even what needs to be kept to herself entirely. Your wife needs to recognise that what happens on social media, does not just stay on social media, and her behaviour could get her (and by extension you) into a lot of trouble. \n\nConsidering how social media is being used these days, especially by celebrities, I'm not surprised she's lost perspective. You should bring this up again in counselling, and keep bringing it up until she realises that what she's doing could have serious consequences in your lives. People have lost jobs and been taken to court over stuff on social media, it also makes great evidence in a court case or custody dispute.", "Just take a moment when she is not angry to discuss your children's digital footprint. New employers look up names on social media before employing. Does she really feel its OK to put all that stuff on there from when they were young? Does she not understand that once it's out there, you can't take it back?", "\"I told her if it happened again, I\u2019d report her.\"\n\nBut for this I would be more troubled. NTA.", "Is your wife a 15 yr old in high school? The concept of keeping someone else\u2019s private business off social media is not up for debate. Id report as many posts as possible and it may lead to an account suspension. \nYour wife is immature and a drama queen \n\nNTA", " NTA - normally logging into someone\u2019s profile, etc is always a no but your wife is completely out of like for sharing all of this. She needs to stop as she\u2019s in no way helping the situation and likely, is hurting it.", "YTA for marrying someone that has no respect for her kids (this includes her bashing her ex, her kids do not need to see that ever, they live with being abandoned, and not allowing them privacy), for you (disrespects boundaries and posts stuff about you, your ex, and your child) or for your kid (deserves privacy and should not be seeing posts about her birth mother).  How you can not divorce your wife over all that is amazing.  I don't know how you justified in your mind that your wife adopting your daughter was a good thing, but you were wrong.  You do know that she can post stuff and block you from seeing it, right?  You have broken picker syndrome.  You pick out people for relationships that you should have run from long ago.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One of which is not biologically mine. I made it very clear to her mother when we got together that being her dad was not only for putting food on the table and clothes on her back. I do all of the things that a father does. Including making decisions on things like this. I feel like when families are blended there is this idea that the kids are somehow still separate. You house them, feed them, clothe them, play with them, hug them when they're sad, look after them when they're sick, and help with homework. I could go on but you get the point. You are their dad. If all of that is true then you also have a say in this. When you ask a man to step in and be a dad you don't just get the help, you have to take the opinion too. \n\nThat's why after thirteen years my eldest daughter still calls my house home four years after her mum left. She's still here and gets the same treatment as my bio kids. Because she got the same treatment all the way through. It's why her mum still sees me as her dad. We raised that kid together.", "I feel it should be said that people that over share will weaponize the information to a narrative. Being completely off social media myself, I can't imagine the stress and total lack of respecting boundaries. \n\nI don't know if you can, but if your daughter is legally adopted, I don't think you can force her to stop. She's legally her daughter and there's no laws on over-sharing a minor's life.

I treat them the same as I do Mackenzie, but please do not try to tell me what the dynamic is when you are not in it. \n\nAgain, we\u2019re all in therapy to help us find our groove and hopefully get to that point.

She said she'd do it anyway. Nothing that wasn't suppose to happen took place\n\nNTA", "Yeah, you do see that. But the reason that is so prevalent is that a lot of step-parents are quick to overstep on discipline but weak on affection. I'm not a stepdad to my daughter. I'm her dad.
