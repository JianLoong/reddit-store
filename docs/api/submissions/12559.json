I got angry at my friend when she exposed me\n\nMy friend danna and I got in an argument over something that I did that had an outcome that is not good. \n\nThe thing is that we were at a party, some guy asked me to dance with him and I did. we started flirting and I was very into him, so when he proposed me to leave i accepted. I went over to tell my friends (danna included) that I was leaving. Danna then asked me if I was leaving alone or with someone, i pointed at the guy who was waiting for me. She then told me \"doesn't he have a girlfriend?\" I said I didn't know, but either way we were leaving. I said goodbye and left. \n\nWell some days after that I get a text from an unknown number and the person was blaming me for breaking her relationship and saying things like she knew I slept with her boyfriend and such. I didn't even reply, I just blocked her.\n\nAfter that I was hanging out with danna and three other friends. I showed them the texts and I said I was wondering how that person got my number and who she may be. Well danna told me that it was one of her classmates, she recognized that the guy I slept with was her boyfriend (she saw them both together later) and she told the girl what happened. Her reasoning is that the guy sucks for cheating and that she didn't felt good with herself if she just ignored this. I told her that it's reasonable that she would feel the need to expose him but she didn't had to give this girl my number so she could harass me too because I don't deserve it. She should've said that she saw the girl's bf with another girl but didn't had to expose me (my other friends agreed on this). She said that she tried to tell me that he had a girlfriend but I didn't listen to her, and that cheaters deserve to be exposed. \n\nLater I was talking with another friend (who didn't know what happened) and he said that it was indeed shitty that I got exposed but that I deserved it and danna was right.
