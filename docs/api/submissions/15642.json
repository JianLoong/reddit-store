She should have your dad's number in your file if she really wants to talk to him. Seems like asking was an intimidation tactic. I don't know if you technically have to give it according to the rules of your school, but I feel that is a different matter. This has the same energy as those who refuse to give their ID to the police when they ask illegally. It is not about being disrespectful. It is about standing up for yourself. They may have a level of power over you, but that doesn't mean they can do whatever they want. Ideally when using this tactic though you want to try and be as respectful as possible.

If you refuse to complete in class essays and instead put your head in your friend's lap, you will face repercussions.

She just is homophobic and wants to find something to punish OP over. So to avoid any questioning or being found out by administration, she thought this would be easier.

It appears also that there is a push this year to expand it further. Public sentiment is pushing very hard against publicizing homosexuality. \n\nIt is a fact with 100% certainty that OP's teacher has access to a phone number for OP's parent/guardian. They do not *need* OP to tell them a phone number to contact the parent. Therefore we can infer from this that the teacher asked for the number as a threat to manage the behavior in the classroom. While this act in and of itself is homophobic, and I do think the teacher is homophobic, I believe it was motivated more by a desire to protect their job.\n\nPublic school teachers have a high degree of public scrutiny and accountability. They are scrutinized by parents, by the public, and the media, and they are accountable to state and local laws plus the school board.\n\nThe Don't Say Gay law has behind it a strong public sentiment that parents and lawmakers (and therefore the school board, very likely, since they are also elected officials) are sensitive and hateful toward the existence of appearances of homosexuality in the classroom. This concern does not exist for straight students, because it's publically accepted.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nBack to the teacher having OP's parent contact info: the teacher probably knows that calling OP's parent will raise a flag that the teacher is discriminating against OP. Regardless of Florida's shitty laws, there are Federal Laws against discrimination. Contacting the parent for singling out two female students holding hands when they have no such policy against mixed gendered students holding hands is clear discrimination and has an incredibly high chance of being escalated to Admin. So they cannot contact the parents and the threat is an empty one.\n\nAnd yet the teacher has on the other hand if it got out that the teacher was queer-friendly, a public outcry could cost them their position in the end. Laws don't have to be broken for parents to pressure the school board to terminate a teacher.\n\nSo instead, the teacher tries to stop the PDA in-house so it doesn't get to either point: an empty threat results in OP's hand being forced, and their discrimination is not shared. \n\nIt was Theatre (no pun intended). It sucks. This country sucks. But I think that's why they did what they did. When the state laws and voters are homophobic, the state employees will have to abide by them. In this case the teacher leaned pretty hard into it. The ethical way for the teacher to mitigate their concerns would be to ban all PDA in their classroom, not just same-gender PDA. In that sense, they are homophobic themselves.\n\n(NTA, I'm very sorry this happened to you. Regardless of your father being very busy, I'd at least talk to him about this, OP)", "Well that's good!

Yea, I know it would have been much worse \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "Absolutely, it was a scare tactic by the staff member imo", "Ugh. I\u2019m sorry. I grew up in Miami, and I can\u2019t recognize my state anymore. It makes me so sad and *so* angry that these fucking teachers are emboldened by DeSantis.", "The whole damn South enters the chat", "It's basically doing her best imitation of a Mafia extortion speech.\n\n\"Nice un-abused life you've got there.  Sure would be a shame if someone told your parents something they thought could get you kicked out of the house or beaten.  Maybe it's best you just go along with what I want to make sure that doesn't happen to happen.\"", "I went to high school in Miami back in the early 90s. And same. I don\u2019t even recognize the state anymore.", "Just a statement of fact. It's fucking scary what they're doing there", "The staff member is a rat", "Go to college outside of Florida for your own sake, please. You need to know there are other parts of the world that will embrace you. Chicago is cold but loving.", "Is the record keeping so bad she couldn't get the info herself?  Like really, I want to talk to a parent so I ask the kid...  I was in HS in the 90s, they knew how to contact my parents, they didn't ask me.  \n\nSorry rant about the basic stupidity of your teacher.", "I am flabbergasted that a theatre teacher is homophobic lol NTA", "NTA!\n\nBut your that got your back! \nAsk him if its okey to gived to her the next time, and if he can make her uncomfortable", "OP, this teacher's behavior is unacceptable, not yours. She is discriminatory and homophobic. She is not a good teacher. You did not cause a scene, you stood up for yourself.\n\nIf a teacher ever did this to me, all three of my parents (mom, dad, and stepdad) would have been waiting at her doorstep when she got home. She would have had way more than their phone numbers. In fact, my mom did confront a few teachers over the years for the way they treated me, lol.\n\nNTA in any way, and do not accept homophobic behavior from others.", "NTA your parents should report her.", "Your teacher should be fired!", "NTA\n\nIf she's a teacher, she has access to your parents' contact information. It's in your records and she can access it whenever she wants. The exception to that would be if your parents didn't fill out the beginning of the year paperwork properly. There's not usually a reason to ask a student you teach for their parents' contact info unless the number on file has been disconnected or changed.", "NTA. If a teacher wants to contact a parent / guardian they can go to the admin office and get it.", "NTA, but it sounds like your dad is on your side, in which case you should give her his number so he can yell directly into her ear. Or you can suggest he come in and he can embarrass her in front of the whole class.", "NTA.  It seems pretty clear what this woman's agenda is.  You were not being disrespectful - she was by saying your affection for your friend isn't normal, and it sounds like the only person in the class who's \"disturbed\" by your affection with your friend is her.  \n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself.  And honestly, if your teacher is that upset by same-sex affection, theater was a weird-ass path for her to choose.", "And she knows it.   There's a reason she asked op directly instead of going through normal school channels.", "You parents should be contacting the school. This is definitely a parents job. As you have experienced, they aren't going to take you seriously at all.", "I wholeheartedly agree NTA. Stay strong and stand your ground the way you have.\n\nWhile quite crass, the first thing I thought was the teacher thought your dad was hot and was using you as a way to get to him. But then the homophobia and bullying of a student. \n\nAt the very least she needs to go for an intensive refresher course on bullying and respect.", "Contact the superintendent. The superintendent and school board are elected officials and don\u2019t want anything to mar their term and chance at reelection. A principal is hired as a job so they have less concern. \n\nWhen I had issues at my kids school I always went to the school board to get things done.", "\u201cbest teacher\u201d who runs a judgmental improv class? this district\u2019s bar is on the floor.", "Yea, have someone or you record next time, blast it online and then we\u2019ll see just how much she\u2019s worth.

Dad agreed with OP.", "Or Texas, isn't Texas the \"we can call CPS on you if you support your kid's gender identity\" state?", "Just reading the title and not the content I thought the teacher might have the hots for the dad.", "It unfortunately probably would fly. OP is in Florida.", "You need to pay attention, especially being in Florida. I'm not trying to scare you, but things are truly dangerous now and it's only getting worse.\n\nYou did the right thing by not giving her your dad's number. Stay strong and please start voting when you turn 18.", "Bullshit.\n\nThe teacher has stated her issue is with her behaving in a certain way that is only a problem because it's a same sex behavior The behvior is not deemed problematic when it's displayed by hetero couples, and the issue of her participation in class isn't even mentioned by the teacber. \n\nThe appropriate response to skipping sections of assignments is them being graded as a zero. But that is not even in the realm of what the teacher said she is having issues with.", "A theater teacher who is homophobic? Highly unlikely. \n\nThe teacher could have readily looked in the student's file for the number. \n\nI'm sorry...but this story doesn't seem true.", "NTA - If there was an issue she needed to discuss, she could have arranged it though the office to contact your dad. She probably didn't do that because she'd have to justify her homophobic tendencies.", "Why did the teacher not go to the office and get a parents number. What kind is going to give someone a phone number to yell about him. The patent need to go over her head about trying to control who he is friend with.", "NTA. Your parents should go to the principal and complain about theater teacher's homophobic behavior. The guy who stood up for you, the one with the GF, clearly also noticed the double standard which can only be explained with homophobia. I bet other class mates would support you, too.", "At first I was thinking \u201cif you\u2019re not participating in a part of class, I mean yeah you\u2019re going to get in trouble, although I feel like the teacher calling your dad directly is weird\u201d, but then it devolved into her not liking you being affectionate with a fellow female student? Yeah NTA.", "NTA, however your teacher is a smoking hot gaping homophobic AH who wants to Un-gay you by being a tattletale, more power to you for standing your ground!", "Write down all these things and document everything!! \n\nIf she wanted his number so bad she could have went to the office and got it. She just wanted to open her mouth and yap homophobia.", "Go to the school board. NTA", "That's only if OP lives in the US. In most other countries it's not that easy to drag someone to court. \n\nHowever if OP really does not live in the US I'd suggest going to the (yellow) press.

Then however she would be wise to switch classes if possible...", "shout out to the student who spoke up, ally with capital A!", "OP lives in Florida. They won\u2019t get anywhere trying to sue while living in a state like that.", "Please define bigoted and explain how you think it relates to this comment.", "NTA she\u2019s obviously homophobic and that needs to be addressed ASAP. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be a teacher with that attitude. If that was my kid I\u2019d be raising hell at that school. I\u2019d be threatening lawsuits and everything else under the sun. You don\u2019t get to treat people like crap because they live differently than you.  That\u2019s disgusting behavior on her part and it\u2019s discrimination.", "Also the school has parents contact details on record. She doesn\u2019t need to ask any student, she just checks on their records if she has to contact a parent. I think she was angling for a personal mobile number and on the records there is just the main contact details or email and she wants to discuss something \u2018off the record\u2019. Creepy and against the rules most likely. OP is NTA.", "I'm sorry this is happening. It's not ok. One, your dad is great and I'm glad he's supporting you. \n\nYour mom on the other hand...it's unfortunate that she's bought into women being less than. That having a point of view and that others' comfort matters more than yours. \n\nNTA and please continue to seek support and know that you have a right to safe, supportive relationships. I'm sorry your mom is failing at supporting you.", "As the others have said, threaten with a lawsuit. Draft up an email (preferably with a lawyer) about pursuing legal action over their inability to take action against blatant homophobia and discrimination. Then send that email to admin and *everyone above admin*. Admin exists to protect the school, not the students unfortunately. Going above will put pressure on them to take action and they can't just claim they didn't know anything was going on.\n\nThen if they still don't take action then follow through and file a lawsuit and then also contact local news. Most will definitely be interested in blasting a school to show their loving support for the LGBTQ+ community.", "Consider contacting the ACLU for advice/help. A lesbian couple did that in my state and the ACLU helped them sue the school and file a complaint with the Dept. of Education. The state DoE launched an investigation and the school was eventually put under a close scrutiny review thing (can\u2019t remember what it was called), administrators were demoted, money was donated to LGBTQ+ organizations of the girls\u2019 choosing, etc. \n\nThings that were perhaps considered more egregious than what the theatre teacher is doing happened in this district but even if you don\u2019t have enough for a lawsuit in your case, there might be collectively. The ACLU keeps records of complaints/contacts and others may have had issues with the school district.", "Same tho", "Please pay attention; both drag and being trans are now pretty much punishable by death in Florida. It's becoming extremely unsafe", "NTA talk to your guidance counselor or another person in authority and explain what\u2019s going on", "Absolutely do not give out personal phone numbers to teachers/colleagues. \nIf she wants to speak with your parents, she can use the proper channels to request that. And she *should* know this, tf is wrong with her?", "NTA. I faced this in middle school. This one yard duty lady who was the mother of one of my classmates and conservative (she ironically looked very butch) asked me and my friend who were holding hands if we could \"just link arms or something instead\" like wtf is wrong with people. We were like why?? So funny how conservatives are always trying to sexualize things while crying that everyone else is a sexual predator", "NTA OP. I would have snatched the phone back and told the principal about the teacher\u2019s homophobic behavior.", "She is being very unprofessional.  First, she should not be discussing this in front of the whole class. Second, she it putting her personal views forward rather than any kind of balanced analysis.

What exactly makes Florida \"scary\" for non-white, non-straight, non-republicans? \n\nLike some book can't be checked out in a middle school library or something? Damn.

Listen to your teachers child", "No one apart from the teacher thinks u r TA. What ur mom meant was, u should have let ur dad put her in her place instead of giving her more ammunition to prove u r a problem child. Either way, NTA all the way.", "NTA.

It was nice of that young man to have your back.", "...If your dad is willing to tell her off, give her the number.
