You\u2019re very affectionate with *friends name*(15F) and it\u2019s disturbing the class\u201d the only thing we do is lean on each other or hold hands, rarely ever though. \n\nBefore I could even reply, someone I didn\u2019t know well interrupted. He asked why it was a problem for me to be affectionate with my friend when he\u2019s way more affectionate with his girlfriend. \n\nShe said that my situation was \u201cdifferent\u201d and that is wasn\u2019t normal for me to be this affectionate with a female friend.

I also look like a stereotypical lesbian, so I think she thinks we are dating, can\u2019t be sure though) She once again asked for my dads number so I said \u201cNo. if you want it that bad, look online.\u201d I might have said it in a disrespectful tone but I was upset. \n\nShe told me I wasn\u2019t allowed to sit with the rest of the class because I was being disrespectful and put me across the room and took my phone. \n\nI told my dad and he said that my teacher had no right to talk to me like that but my mother was on a call with him and said I should have just gave her my number and sat back down and not caused a scene. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682425568, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yhw2g/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_dads_number_to_my/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s not even the first step to handling any type of behavioral concern in a school. And teachers certainly don\u2019t get parental information from students. Sounds like they were trying to tattle and cause the most direct harm to you. A teacher who was genuinely concerned about behavior would raise the issue with the school. Your teacher may be wanting to avoid proper protocols that would reveal you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. \n\nYour mom may be conditioned by a culture instilling women to just do what they\u2019re told.

Regarding your level of affection towards any other human - it\u2019s none of her business unless it\u2019s violating school policy/rules.  So make sure you\u2019re within the bounds of student conduct.  If her harassment persists you may need to have your parents schedule a meeting.  Let your parents take the helm in this if you can because it sounds like this teacher abuses authority.", "NTA imo. It sounds like she is being homophobic and just mean to certain personality types. She should have your dad's number in your file if she really wants to talk to him. Seems like asking was an intimidation tactic. I don't know if you technically have to give it according to the rules of your school, but I feel that is a different matter. This has the same energy as those who refuse to give their ID to the police when they ask illegally. It is not about being disrespectful. It is about standing up for yourself. They may have a level of power over you, but that doesn't mean they can do whatever they want. Ideally when using this tactic though you want to try and be as respectful as possible. It definitely becomes grayer if you were a jerk about it, but I stand behind you for the principle of it.", "The teacher can get this information from the main office. Why did she ask you?

Being respectful is usually more effective, especially for women. That is the main reason I stress it. Abusive authority will use your emotions to punish you. So while trying not to snap is smart, it in no way makes you TA. She absolutely seems the type to use emotions against you.

Why would she need you to tell her, when she could have got it elsewhere, pretty easily? And if there's a problem, why hasn't she done that since? Very peculiar.", "Might start taking a micro recorder to class and recording all the convos.  Not your phone because they can take those - but a recorder like college students used get for classes to record the lessons and lectures.  I think they are called digital voice recorders.

You say your dad was not pleased with your interaction with the teacher, so I'm a little baffled as to why he hasn't contacted the school himself. Especially, since there's a distinct whiff of homophobia from the teacher in your post.", "Teachers don't investigate. They already have the contact information for the guardians of their students. Believe me, I had teachers who seemed to have my mom's number on speed dial. \n\nYou are doing something wrong. You have refused to participate in certain aspects of the class. That's not how this works. You don't get to choose to skip assignments, quizzes, presentations, or the improvisational classwork. \n\nI know that you're a kid and it shows. You're refusing to take responsibility for your inaction and are instead pointing blame outward. Rather than admitting that you're intimidated by the improv sessions, you are blaming your classmates for being judgemental. Does this mean that you are refusing to get on stage all together? Either way, you aren't doing the work.\n\nYou are also assuming that your appearance and perceived orientation are the reasons that you're being treated \"unfairly.\" Teachers aren't omnipotent. They often enforce rules and punishment unequally, sometimes because of inherent bias and other times because they simply missed it.  Have you considered that there is a perfectly valid reason for your teacher to comment on your affectionate behavior? You're sitting in the back of a possibly darkened theater actively avoiding having to participate in classroom activities all while performing public displays of physical affection with your friend. That would be infuriating to any teacher and it would indicate that you're in their classroom for the wrong reasons. \n\nIf you refuse to run laps in gym class and instead give your friend a massage there will be problems. If you refuse to complete in class essays and instead put your head in your friend's lap, you will face repercussions. If you refuse to complete labs in chemistry class and instead slow dance with your home girl near the eyewash, you're going to hear about it. If you refuse to take quizzes in precalc and spend that time playing footsie with your bestie your behavior will be called out. \n\nYou are using classroom time inappropriately. Drama class isn't social hour and it certainly isn't the proper venue for physical displays of affection.\n\nEdit: YTA", "He hasn\u2019t had time, if he were to contact the school. And I don\u2019t know what she wants to investigate."]}
