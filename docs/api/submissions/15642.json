She should have your dad's number in your file if she really wants to talk to him. Seems like asking was an intimidation tactic. I don't know if you technically have to give it according to the rules of your school, but I feel that is a different matter. This has the same energy as those who refuse to give their ID to the police when they ask illegally. It is not about being disrespectful. It is about standing up for yourself. They may have a level of power over you, but that doesn't mean they can do whatever they want. Ideally when using this tactic though you want to try and be as respectful as possible.

Either way, you aren't doing the work.\n\nYou are also assuming that your appearance and perceived orientation are the reasons that you're being treated \"unfairly.\" Teachers aren't omnipotent. They often enforce rules and punishment unequally, sometimes because of inherent bias and other times because they simply missed it.  Have you considered that there is a perfectly valid reason for your teacher to comment on your affectionate behavior? You're sitting in the back of a possibly darkened theater actively avoiding having to participate in classroom activities all while performing public displays of physical affection with your friend. That would be infuriating to any teacher and it would indicate that you're in their classroom for the wrong reasons. \n\nIf you refuse to run laps in gym class and instead give your friend a massage there will be problems. If you refuse to complete in class essays and instead put your head in your friend's lap, you will face repercussions. If you refuse to complete labs in chemistry class and instead slow dance with your home girl near the eyewash, you're going to hear about it. If you refuse to take quizzes in precalc and spend that time playing footsie with your bestie your behavior will be called out. \n\nYou are using classroom time inappropriately.

But this isn\u2019t really appropriate behaviour for a class environment, theatre or no. I know every year there are some students, and frankly it does happen *way* more often with LGBT students, who are quite physically affectionate in a way that is honestly uncomfortable for others around. Sometimes even whispering to one another and pretty much cuddling. \n\nThis is sometimes more normalized in theatre spaces, but frankly it\u2019s one of the things that made me uncomfortable in theatre spaces even though I loved acting. I just don\u2019t see school classrooms as somewhere that you need to be holding hands and \u201cleaning on each other\u201d during class time. \n\nI get for lgbt students that it is a way to assert yourself in public spaces and often home might not actually be somewhere that you can be close and affectionate, so maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s so much more common with these kids. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong except a time and place issue most of the time.  \n\nThe thing is, I have seen both sides. I have seen pervasive subtle discrimination and prejudice at work when lgbt students express themselves or are affectionate in public spaces in schools, and I\u2019ve seen teachers be homophonic and nasty. But I have (frankly way more often in the last five years, granted I live in an area where rights are NOT being challenged) also seen lgbt students perceive discrimination where there is none, or made a deliberate and consistent show of affection unlike anything their heterosexual classmates ever do, and then jump to accusing people of homophobia over politely averting their gaze or simply not wanting to be in a group with the couple who won\u2019t stop sitting in each other\u2019s laps. \n\nI\u2019m not sure where OP\u2019s situation falls without context from other parties. \n\nEvery now and then adults do it too, like my sister had her boyfriend at the time over and they couldn\u2019t not be touching somehow for the entire two hours of dinner and visiting with our parents. Not enough to be outright rude but it definitely made for an awkward evening. \n\nAnd I am *by no means* a prude. Home hands in the street, kiss at the park, get your freak on at home. That\u2019s life, live it. Enjoy each other. \n\nBut whether or not it is discrimination in this case frankly depends on whether or not their heterosexual counterparts in class are regularly leaning on each other and holding hands and their parents are *not* contacted. \n\nI would hope in this situation the teacher would actually have taken OP aside and just gently remind that being affectionate in a classroom space just isn\u2019t the right vibe, before jumping to claiming they\u2019re somehow disrupting the entire class and contacting their parents. I would even say that asking their guidance counsellor to have a word before contacting parents is a good idea, especially with lgbt kids when it is unclear how supportive parents might be. \n\nIf the teacher didn\u2019t do any of this, then I would venture to suspect something off with the teacher as well.  \n\nI\u2019m just also very, very aware at how unreliable and selective teenage narrators can be when they feel they\u2019ve been done dirty.\n\nI think it would be a good idea for admin, the teacher, the student, and the parent should meet to get this story straightened out.", "I\u2019m not entirely sure how it works but that was my first question too. Usually the school has that information in case of emergencies. It\u2019s suspicious to me that she went to the child to try to pressure the information out of them then punishing them, rather than bringing it up to administration. My guess is, she knew she didn\u2019t have any good grounds and reason to get the info to contact their parent because OP truly wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. She just is homophobic and wants to find something to punish OP over. So to avoid any questioning or being found out by administration, she thought this would be easier. If she had any true issues/concerns that needed to desperately contact OPs parents over, she could have gone straight to the principal to handle it once OP refused.", "Right??

I'm not telling you to do this, but I'm not telling you not to either.  they don't Believe you because the teacher is \"the best teacher\" or whatever right? When I was in highschool math was my worse subject and I hated it. My senior year when they did open house the teacher told my mom how I could ask any questions and he would try to help me and blah blah blah. The class was pretty bad. It was loud, there were tons of conversations going on and none of them about the class, some of the other kids were pretty bad (and not to mention I never felt comfortable asking questions because of how he responded to some of the students ... Granted a majority of it were the students that were going off on different conversations but still). I told my mom about the class one day, and she didn't believe me either. So what I did was I had my phone out on record and put it on my lap and just recorded to show my mom later. She definitely believed me after that, though I did have to convince her not to go to the teacher or principal or anything.

School board!", "If it\u2019s a teacher in your high school she should have access to your family\u2019s phone numbers anyway in their attendance system. Can you talk to the student that spoke up for you and go to admin with them? Power in numbers help with admin in my experience.", "Maybe look into civil rights organisations to help you.", "Also\u2026most teachers have their parents numbers or can access them through the office. This was a power play, get OP to give her the number to get OP in trouble.", "I know you don't really like drawing attention to yourself, but loudly saying \"Oh she's homophobic\" every time you hear her name will eventually lead them to doing something. And if they try to say something to you about it, call them out for their inaction and how they're lucky you haven't sued them for THEIR discriminatory behavior.", "Your dad can certainly do meetings if they're important to the wellbeing of his daughter.

Nothing has happened so it wasn\u2019t a very good power move. If OP reported this to me as a parent, I wouldn\u2019t be waiting for a call from the teacher. \n\nTeachers don\u2019t need to request any information from students.

You even have a witness", "It doesn\u2019t have to have OP in trouble. It\u2019s the high the teacher gets in lil old students giving her their parents numbers for teacher to call. \n\nEven if she never calls dad, the lingering additional threat, as well as OP knowing Op gave the number\u2026adds more emotional heft to it. \n\nTeacher knows what she\u2019s doing (she\u2019s a homophobic AH) but she knows the emotional threat of what she\u2019s doing.", "oh god, you're in Florida. \ud83d\ude2c stay strong, kiddo - and sounds like that dude that spoke up is one to know better. he was great standing up for you against that teacher", "Have you tried contacting the media? Also, since you live in Florida, couldn't it be argued that it is illegal for her to talk about your sexuality with you so you could try getting her on that?", "I\u2019m not disagreeing with you but I\u2019m also not getting that feeling. Teachers are the authority figure in the classroom, they don\u2019t really need or have the time to play head games with individual students (based on my own experience). Either there is a problem or there isn\u2019t.\n\nThis is a disciplinary or fireable action for this teacher. If the other kid who jumped in witnessed this conversation then both OP & that kid should be sitting in the main office right now to report this conversation. If the administration ignores them, then call the superintendent\u2019s office. It they ignore them, call the ACLU. There are lots of ways to resolve this & to protect OP\u2019s rights.

Good job, and NTA!)", "What about an email? There\u2019s usually some kind of admin email on a school\u2019s website. I work with parents who sometimes have to fight for school services and I highly recommend emails because the concerns are now documented. The school can\u2019t later say they didn\u2019t know. There\u2019s the added bonus that you can write the email whenever it\u2019s convenient for you (or your dad) and you can take your time to word it the way you want and include the details you want.", "I mean, yeah, that. Not many people have the money to buy a micro recorder, especially when you're in HS.  Not only that, but you also live a two party consent state. So, you would not only need your own permission to record your teacher, but you would also need her permission as well. Otherwise, it would be illegal to record her and you having a conversation.\n\nAlso, I think you're NTA. That's highly inappropriate for the teacher to do.", "I couldn\u2019t care less about who OP dates or has as friends. Kids are in school to learn... the classroom is not the place for PDA. For anyone. I would tell my kids the same. No one needs to hold hands with anyone to pay attention & if you\u2019re doing that you\u2019re probably not paying attention. \n\nI\u2019m a Mom, I own my own business & I\u2019m probably older than most people on this post. So you\u2019re not going to get me onboard with the holding hands thing. It\u2019s just not necessary. No one goes to work & holds hands with someone during a meeting. Doesn\u2019t happen.", "Public (or even private) school isn't employment. The dynamics of work or college don't apply to grade school unless the course is a college-level course. \n\nA key benefit and purpose of schooling that you just dismissed is to socialize the kids. A key reason there was such a big push to open up public schools at the start of the COVID pandemic was the grave concern that the students losing school would impact their overall emotional and social growth as people, not just learning their core curriculum.\n\nDeveloping socially post-puberty will invariably lead to some romantic relationships. While I myself never dated in high school, none of the kids bat an eye at hand-holding of any kind (other than boy-boy, read, homophobia). When teenagers get a job, the managers can limit their PDA all day long."]}
