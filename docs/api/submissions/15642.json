She should have your dad's number in your file if she really wants to talk to him. Seems like asking was an intimidation tactic. I don't know if you technically have to give it according to the rules of your school, but I feel that is a different matter. This has the same energy as those who refuse to give their ID to the police when they ask illegally. It is not about being disrespectful. It is about standing up for yourself. They may have a level of power over you, but that doesn't mean they can do whatever they want. Ideally when using this tactic though you want to try and be as respectful as possible.

If you refuse to complete in class essays and instead put your head in your friend's lap, you will face repercussions.

My guess is, she knew she didn\u2019t have any good grounds and reason to get the info to contact their parent because OP truly wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. She just is homophobic and wants to find something to punish OP over. So to avoid any questioning or being found out by administration, she thought this would be easier.

Granted a majority of it were the students that were going off on different conversations but still). I told my mom about the class one day, and she didn't believe me either.

It appears also that there is a push this year to expand it further. Public sentiment is pushing very hard against publicizing homosexuality. \n\nIt is a fact with 100% certainty that OP's teacher has access to a phone number for OP's parent/guardian. They do not *need* OP to tell them a phone number to contact the parent. Therefore we can infer from this that the teacher asked for the number as a threat to manage the behavior in the classroom. While this act in and of itself is homophobic, and I do think the teacher is homophobic, I believe it was motivated more by a desire to protect their job.\n\nPublic school teachers have a high degree of public scrutiny and accountability. They are scrutinized by parents, by the public, and the media, and they are accountable to state and local laws plus the school board.\n\nThe Don't Say Gay law has behind it a strong public sentiment that parents and lawmakers (and therefore the school board, very likely, since they are also elected officials) are sensitive and hateful toward the existence of appearances of homosexuality in the classroom. This concern does not exist for straight students, because it's publically accepted.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nBack to the teacher having OP's parent contact info: the teacher probably knows that calling OP's parent will raise a flag that the teacher is discriminating against OP. Regardless of Florida's shitty laws, there are Federal Laws against discrimination. Contacting the parent for singling out two female students holding hands when they have no such policy against mixed gendered students holding hands is clear discrimination and has an incredibly high chance of being escalated to Admin. So they cannot contact the parents and the threat is an empty one.\n\nAnd yet the teacher has on the other hand if it got out that the teacher was queer-friendly, a public outcry could cost them their position in the end. Laws don't have to be broken for parents to pressure the school board to terminate a teacher.\n\nSo instead, the teacher tries to stop the PDA in-house so it doesn't get to either point: an empty threat results in OP's hand being forced, and their discrimination is not shared. \n\nIt was Theatre (no pun intended). It sucks. This country sucks. But I think that's why they did what they did. When the state laws and voters are homophobic, the state employees will have to abide by them. In this case the teacher leaned pretty hard into it. The ethical way for the teacher to mitigate their concerns would be to ban all PDA in their classroom, not just same-gender PDA. In that sense, they are homophobic themselves.\n\n(NTA, I'm very sorry this happened to you. Regardless of your father being very busy, I'd at least talk to him about this, OP)", "Well that's good!
