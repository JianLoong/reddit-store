You are not selfish. HE IS!!! Of course he doesn\u2019t care because he\u2019s getting his sleep. You should be mad at him not him mad at you!!! He\u2019s literally not caring about your well-being and that totally sucks. \n\nI\u2019d advise waking him up every time he snores, with that much sleep he\u2019ll go get more help. Very selfish of him to disregard your thoughts and feelings AND your health.", "Nta. It is selfish. If he has sleep apnea it could be deadly. It can literally kill you. He\u2019s being selfish by not getting it treated.", "You are NTA, this is a medical problem that is currently affecting your sleep but could affect his sleep/life one day (sleep apnea).  He should have a sleep study done and consider a cpap machine.  My sister uses one and it's pretty quiet, so you should be able to sleep.\n\nIf not, can you sleep in another room?  You need your sleep!", "NTA he needs to see somebody if it\u2019s this bad.  It could easily be sleep apnea or a deviated septum.  Both which cause heavy snoring.\n\nHealth aside he would still be an AH.  He knows it\u2019s messing with your sleep and he\u2019s not willing to do the next step to help.  He is selfish.", "He refuses to see doctors for any reason, literally ever. It's infuriating tbh. I could sleep on the couch but I feel like HE should, considering he's the one that's causing all the discomfort and could asleep anywhere lol.", "NTA. Your husband needs to do a sleep study, because he may have sleep apnea which increases his risk of stroke and heart attack. Otherwise, I heard this trick recommended for snoring - get a tshirt with a pocket and put it on backwards before going to bed. Put a tennis ball in the pocket. This will prevent you from sleeping on your back, the position in which most snoring occurs. If he refuses both of those, he can sleep on the couch. He\u2019s causing the problem but refusing to do anything about it.", "NTA - similar situation.. I snore and have severe sleep apnea. Unfortunately the cpap solution does not work for me and after evaluation it was determine I\u2019m not a candidate for surgery. It\u2019s also not weight related. So the solution for us was unfortunately to sleep separately. She sleeps in another room so that she can get good rest. While we both miss sleeping together we both recognize the importance of her getting sound sleep and good rest. I also didn\u2019t hesitate to get evaluated and do a sleep study as I was not having restful sleep and the sleep apnea was causing me to have a significant drop on my blood oxygen levels due to the frequent gaps in my breathing and waking up gasping for air. \n\nYour husband is foolish for avoiding medical care. I don\u2019t know his rationale for this but in this case he should do it for you as well as for himself. \n\nIf you don\u2019t currently have a spare bedroom it may be time to evaluate finding another place that can accommodate that. Sleeping on the couch may get you a good night sleep but unless your couch is super supportive it isn\u2019t good for your body as it is not designed well enough as a long term sleeping solution. You may start having aches and soreness or lower back problems over time. Get a suitable bed so you can have a sound comfortable night sleep. Or alternate with your husband so that you are not the one always sleeping on the couch. \n\nWishing you the best.", "NTA\n\nHave you recorded him snoring? Maybe he doesn't realize how bad it really is and needs to hear it for himself. \n\nIt is possible that once he hears himself snoring, he will do something about it. \n\nHe should be the one to sleep on the couch if he doesn't want to fix his issue.", "\"I'm not going through all that\" is typical of the silly shit I said before \\*my\\* sleep study. A CPAP machine changed my life. He owes it to himself to get checked.\n\nThree hours sleep? Have you thought of waking him every time he wakes you? He's being a arse. You - NTA. Him - unable to admit when he's wrong", "NTA\n\nSounds like he's either doing the macho, \"I don't need a doctor!\" routine or just doesn't care since it doesn't impact his sleep - which is completely selfish.\n\nPerhaps if you also wake him up, fully, each time his snoring wakes you he might get an idea of what you're going through.", "Him refusing to go seek medical treatment is telling. He obviously has some breathing issues, sleep apnea would be my guess. But I am not a doctor. Having insomnia is a bitch, and working 12 hour days, does not leave a whole lot of down time, nor rest. He is the selfish one in this narrative. If you don\u2019t get the help you need soon, something is going to give; and it won\u2019t be pretty. \n\nNTA", "Yeah, he could have sleep apnea and that is potentially dangerous. He needs a sleep study to see if he needs a cpap machine.", "NTA\u2026nope.  If it were me, and he was already asleep, I would sleep in the couch.  Or honestly, I would hold off on \u201cplaying scrabble\u201d until he sees a doctor.   It could be an easy fix.  He should care enough about you to do so.  You should also see someone about your sleep issues as well.", "Nah dawg, a marriage is a partnership where you should both be putting each others needs and interests first.  If you\u2019re coming to him desperately asking for help on such a basic human need, he should be trying to go out of his way to help you with it.  Maybe he is failing to put himself in your shoes, idk, but exhaust all your efforts and if he doesn\u2019t pull his weight in the situation, just take control and look out for yourself since he\u2019s refusing to help.", "NTA. i had a similar issue with my ex. i eventually forced her to sleep on the couch but she was so pissy about it. thankfully she\u2019s my ex", "op=nta\n\nIf he has sleep apnea, it's actually a hazard to his health and he REALLY needs to get it checked out.\n\nYou could end up finding a corpse on the sofa--if he doesn't resolve this(yes this is the worse case scenario).  Or you could get a sleep deprivation pyschosis and unalive him.\n\nMore likely, is that YOUR lack of decent sleep will degrade YOUR health(diabetes, weight gain, mental fog, etc etc)", "Name calling of any kind is immature and puts a rift between you. Next time he wants to tell you something wonderful he\u2019s done or thought or gotten, he\u2019ll say to himself \u201cI wonder if she\u2019ll think that\u2019s selfish?\u201d Then gradually you\u2019ll start thinking how he never talks to you anymore and wonder why.", "NTA\n\nSleep is SO important, especially when working those long shifts and weird hours. Please sleep on the couch until he gets himself to see a doctor and figure it out.\n\nMy spouse and I have bought suffered from insomnia for different reasons and sometimes I'll come out and sleep on the couch when mine acts up and I don't want to wake her with my tossing and turning. It's the polite thing to do. Your spouse should want you to get a good night's sleep!", "NTA. He needs medical evaluation but probably won\u2019t get it.   If his snoring is as bad as my ex\u2019s was, one of you will have to sleep elsewhere.", "You are NTA and your husband should respect how important it is for you to get enough sleep - this is true for everyone but extra true as you work long shifts. However, it sounds like you guys need to figure out a long term solution that means you can sleep in different rooms without one person being \"banished to the couch\" (which makes it seem temporary and like that person is in the wrong). If you have a spare room that's ideal, but if not, setting up some kind of bed in the living room could work too. Even if your husband did see a doctor, doctors can often be bad about sleep related issues and there's no guarantee the problem would get fixed, plus you can't really force someone to see a doctor in the first place. You might have to work around this problem for your whole marriage and sleeping separately might be the only way you can both fill your sleep needs, meaning you'll be able to have a better relationship in the hours that actually matter, when you're awake.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
