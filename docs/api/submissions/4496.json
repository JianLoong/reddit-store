I explained that I don't care what she does, but I don't want to deal with her pregnancy and I especially don't want to deal with a new born in my house. \n\nEmma was crying and said she has no where to go.

She took advantage of that and now wants to extend this to her boyfriend. \n\nShe isn\u2019t your daughter and you isn\u2019t your problem. Charge her market rate for the room, and get her to move into her boyfriends mothers basement.", "NTA, good on you for providing a reality check.

When I was pregnant with my twins I did EVERYTHING I would normally do. I didn't have a cat so that wasn't an issue. You know the hardest thing? Little buggers gave me crazy motion sickness. Even moving my head too fast made me feel sick. I still worked, mowed, took rubbish out, drove even though it made me sick, cleaned and did laundry. She is incredibly immature and is using being pregnant as an excuse. I'm glad you aren't allowing her to manipulate you", "NTA. Your daughter and her friend can go get a place together if they want to be mad about it.", "NTA\n\nBut you shouldn't had her move in in the first place", "NTA.

She is not your responsibility or concern.  Even less so now she is suggesting you allow her freeloading boyfriend to move in too.  As for your daughter, tell her to go rent a place with her friend if she wants to help so much.  Guessing she won't like that idea.\n\nThese people are like fungus - spreading and causing problems.", "NTA. If she thinks she\u2019s ready for the responsibility of taking care of a baby, then she better start taking care of herself first.", "NTA. Her crap decisions are really not your problem.", "NTA she\u2019s not your child and not your responsibility.

Get her out before that kid comes out because in a lot of places it gets way more complicated when there\u2019s a baby.\n\nIf your daughter fights, sit her down and explain how tenancy works. If she still fights it might be time to kick her out (short term) too.\n\nEdit: forgot the sidebar: don\u2019t let a pregnant woman deal with a litter box, could kill the unborn and if the mom wants to keep that\u2019s not cool.", "NTA, but a pregnant person should not be cleaning out a litter box under any circumstances.  Your other complaints are totally valid, though.", "NTA. She is an adult, making adult decisions, and she can take adult responsibility for them. She's taking advantage of you, and you don't owe her anything.", "NTA, she has her own parents she can move in with or to go live with her BF and his parents.  Emma really needs a reality check.\n\nAlthough, the way you phrased it was not a good idea.  It should have been regardless of whether you keep the baby, you need to move out in 60 days.", "NTA I can\u2019t understand parents who don\u2019t plan to take care of their kids before having them.", "NTA. It sucks when two people who shouldn't be having a kid have a kid, but it's not your responsibility and the two of them are gonna have to figure out how to adult real quick.", "NTA\n\nThat's some entitled shit from a mom to be whose baby daddy can't even afford to support her, let alone a child. Jesus christ", "NTA. Contact Emma's parents. Let them know what she's been up to and let them know that in 60 days Emma will be out of your house. If they feel compelled to help, they'll make the trip to your place. Next, talk to Lisa privately. Inform her that she can move out with Emma if she feels you're bring unfair. If she chooses to stay, things will be very different going forward.", "To be fair, she really shouldn\u2019t be cleaning the cat box while pregnant. Toxoplasmosis, ugh.\n\nNevertheless, you are 100% NTA!", "Why are you even asking? Of course you're NTA. If Emma is ready to be a parent, she is ready to be independent. Not only do you have no obligation to support her and her child, you will be exploited for doing so, and have less for your own daughter. Kick her ass to the curb, because PREGNANT.", "NTA. You sound very kind. Maybe too kind. Emma sounds like an absolute brat. 60 days is a fair amount of time. Why was a 21 year old still living at her parents\u2019 house anyway? She and boyfriend should already be living independently. Especially if they\u2019re going to welcome a child into the world.", "Kids need to be accountable for their actions. Not you.", "NTA \n\nBut you need to serve her a legal eviction notice ASAP. \n\nOtherwise, you will have serious problems trying to get her out, as she has already legally established residency at your house.", "NTA  - no good deed goes by unpunished, eh?", "NTA, you're a saint to put up with her and even more by giving her 60 days. I would have given her 30 days. The 1 thing you need to say is that regardless of what she decides, she still needs to move out. This way no one can accuse you of trying to force her to get a abortion.  \nTell your ungrateful daughter if she doesn't agree with your decision she is free to also move out as she is an adult. She can rent a 2 bedroom and all of them including her BF can move into and she will be paying for the majority of the bills.", "NTA \nYou were giving her a cushion to get herself together and she overstepped", "NTA. But your tone is harsh. Can\u2019t really blame ya.", "NTA for not wanting to live with a newborn or wanting bf to move in. N T A for expecting both girls to do chores and definitely N T A for super cheap rent (for future maybe it should have been tied to enrollment in school).\n\nThat being said, as someone who is current pregnant, I do think it\u2019s ok to be flexible on what sort of chores she does. I don\u2019t do the trash when I can help it be a the smell and exertion make me barf. I do lots of chores though, just other things.", "NTA by any means. One thing though and this is not in anyway validating the girl...it is a big thing for pregnant women not to clean litter boxes. Health risks for the child, etc. Everything else, nope. You have been way more than generous and enough is enough. Good call. She needs to go.", "NTA. \n\nI would only talk to them so many times. These are delusional and uninformed young people that don't fully understand responsibility, financial management or how the real world works. And you definitely don't want to deal with their drama and with a newborn added in. \n\nYou don't want her claiming domicile rights. Check your state laws for the proper process to get a temporary compassion stay or renter out of your home when they won't leave on their own.  Maybe they won't be awful and try to refuse to move out but I know people that had to deal with relatives that pulled this move once they got too comfortable.", "NTA", "Absolutely,  without a doubt,  you are NOT the A. NTA. NOT... seriously. They are taking advantage of you.  Make this your hill to die on.  If you even give an inch,  you will never get these leeches out of your house.  Good for you mom!", "NTA, stick to the 60 days. The real issue here is that Emma moved into your house with no plan to ever leave and grow up, and is choosing to have a child because she thought that would get her out of doing work. And she's been using being pregnant as an excuse to not do work, and trying to move her boyfriend into your house as well.\n\nUnless you are really prepared to put her stuff out on the porch, she isn't going to leave and she's going to keep disrespecting you in your home forever. Your moral responsibility is to protect yourself from being used", "NTA - I would have drawn the line at no school or full time job. Way past due in my opinion. It is not your responsibility to house and raise her, much less the BF and now a baby! No thank you!", "NTA.  If she already has pregnancy induced lazy-ass syndrome it definitely won\u2019t get better with time and definitely won\u2019t get better once the baby is born.", "Absolutely NTA. Time for these people to take some personal responsibility. Could you have been nicer about telling her she needs to move out? Sure, but pretty sure is he just as frustrated, especially after her having the audacity to suggest her loser boyfriend move in.\n\nTime to think about the legality of the situation here. I assume no lease, but since she\u2019s been living there a while, local eviction laws will apply. Look into them and give her written notice with plenty of warning. \n\nGood luck OP and don\u2019t cave on this due to guilt!", "NTA", "NTA, not your kid, not your grandkid, not your responsibility. Though quick PSA: no pregnant person should be cleaning out a cat box! Not because it's too hard or whatever, cat feces can carry dangerous disease which could make her sick and impact the fetus. It's called toxoplasmosis, if you wanna Google it. The rest of her \"restrictions\" are rediculous, though.", "NTA", "NTA\u2026however, one thing Emma said she cannot do because she is pregnant is actually valid. Cat litter dust is bad for pregnant women. You are supposed to stay away from cat litter when you are pregnant.", " ETA. \nNTA 60 days notice is fine", "ESH. She and Clint are obviously total assholes. Your phrasing of 'if you plan on keeping the baby' was really tacky, though.
