I would have given her 30 days. The 1 thing you need to say is that regardless of what she decides, she still needs to move out.

These are delusional and uninformed young people that don't fully understand responsibility, financial management or how the real world works.

Check your state laws for the proper process to get a temporary compassion stay or renter out of your home when they won't leave on their own.

NTA. NOT... seriously. They are taking advantage of you.  Make this your hill to die on.  If you even give an inch,  you will never get these leeches out of your house.  Good for you mom!", "NTA, stick to the 60 days. The real issue here is that Emma moved into your house with no plan to ever leave and grow up, and is choosing to have a child because she thought that would get her out of doing work. And she's been using being pregnant as an excuse to not do work, and trying to move her boyfriend into your house as well.\n\nUnless you are really prepared to put her stuff out on the porch, she isn't going to leave and she's going to keep disrespecting you in your home forever. Your moral responsibility is to protect yourself from being used", "NTA - I would have drawn the line at no school or full time job. Way past due in my opinion. It is not your responsibility to house and raise her, much less the BF and now a baby! No thank you!", "NTA.  If she already has pregnancy induced lazy-ass syndrome it definitely won\u2019t get better with time and definitely won\u2019t get better once the baby is born.", "Absolutely NTA. Time for these people to take some personal responsibility. Could you have been nicer about telling her she needs to move out? Sure, but pretty sure is he just as frustrated, especially after her having the audacity to suggest her loser boyfriend move in.\n\nTime to think about the legality of the situation here. I assume no lease, but since she\u2019s been living there a while, local eviction laws will apply. Look into them and give her written notice with plenty of warning. \n\nGood luck OP and don\u2019t cave on this due to guilt!", "NTA", "NTA, not your kid, not your grandkid, not your responsibility. Though quick PSA: no pregnant person should be cleaning out a cat box! Not because it's too hard or whatever, cat feces can carry dangerous disease which could make her sick and impact the fetus. It's called toxoplasmosis, if you wanna Google it. The rest of her \"restrictions\" are rediculous, though.", "NTA", "NTA\u2026however, one thing Emma said she cannot do because she is pregnant is actually valid.
