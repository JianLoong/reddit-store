Her food was missing, from all the spots we keep it in. But not her food bowls. Her litterboxes are missing, but not her litter because it was stored in my room. \n\nMy sister (17) was supposed to move out soon, I wasn\u2019t sure what day but she is now driving and she is far according to Life360 my parents made her get.

My mother finally responded, she froze my sisters funds and will not release them until return of my cat.

I have nova. My sister apparently disowned my mom and now she is sobbing, I still feel like I was the asshole even though I never wound up calling the cops.

Does your 17 year old sister agree that you're the owner? I hate to say it but just because you've paid for the cat's care doesn't necessarily mean she believes you're the \"owner,\" especially if your sister is only 17 and didn't have any money.", "With regards to people saying it is a waste of time to contact the police, they (probably) aren't heartless, they are just warning you of the reality of the situations, that if you call the police and tell them that you think your sister may have stolen your cat when she moved out, 99.9% chance they are not going to get involved or do anything about it, especially considering your sister is a long distance off and you don't even know for certain that she has the cat.  It's just not the kind of thing that they are going to take seriously, they may nod their head and jot down a report, but it will never get followed up on and that is the last you will hear from them. \n\nSo, the point is, if you want the cat back, you are better off directing your energy towards finding/getting in touch with your sister.  \n\nYou wouldn't be an AH for calling the police on your sister because there will be no more consequences for her than if you reported her to a wall... nothing will happen.

You still can work this out within the family to determine where the cat is and to negotiate its return. Don't take the nuclear options before trying other things. I get that you're upset and you aren't getting the answers you want immediately, but don't call the police about this.

That said it does create a paper trail. I'm trying to come up with the best sequence here that will serve you the best as maybe calling them isn't the best NEXT step. Which is frustrating with everyone ghosting you currently. How long has the cat been missing? A couple of hours it may be worth continuing to try and contact your parents and other siblings, maybe call up some local shelters incase she legit got out while the sister was packing or something. Maybe give it until evening. If it's been over a day I'd go get the police report going (though would let nearby shelters know with a picture and that they're microchipped).\n\nFrom my personal experience, the fact the micro chip is in YOUR name might actually be enough for the police if they find the cat in her possession, but I'd still say temper your expectations.  \n\n\n(ETA: as pointed out I missed the part where the other cat gear is missing, which does point to the cat being taken vs escaped, but I'll also add that the first thing the cops will ask is \"have you checked local shelters?\" and \"How do you know it's your sister that took the cat?\" if they even get that far)", "ESH.

Where I live they will only come if someone is actively attacking or has a weapon. If it was an attack that's over already they might come a few days later to get the security footage. If it's a cat, they would not be coming.", "NTA.\nIf that was my cat, I'd have hunted her down myself,  if necessary.", "I'm imagining an action movie chase scene where the cops are trying to catch the sister and save the cat. Yeah I don't know if police are really different in different places but whenever I call the police they ask if the person has a weapon and if not they don't come.", "With it being chipped, wouldn\u2019t they be able to locate it?", "I think perhaps you need to read more on OPs comments. Which you SHOULD have done instead of being an AH and commenting this now.", "Maybe college?", "Oh duh of course.", "absolutely NTA. that is theft. sis can deal with some community service.", "NTA. Glad you got her back.", "NTA\n\nShe stole you cat and I'm glad you have her back. Whyd she steal it in the first place?", "NTA.\nI don't care who you are, if anyone even dares to take my dog, someone will be eating out of a tube for the rest of their life.\n\nYou did right by calling your parents first. And I'm glad your mom was on your side.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is irresponsible and doesn't deserve poor Nova! Give her lots of pets and love!", "NTA I wouldn't have blamed you for calling the police. She stole your cat. That is a terrible thing to do. Good on your Mom for making sure you got it back. \n\nDon't feel bad. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA she took everything except the poop, the nerve", "CAT TAX!", "I sprayed her bed in catnip and gave her lottts of treats, she is being pampered as much as she will tolerate anyways\ud83d\ude05", "I don\u2019t think she did it out of malice to hurt me, she loves Nova. That\u2019s probably why.", "Have you ever tried catnip bubbles, messy as all get out but some cats find them interesting.", "Never even heard of it but that is definitely going on my list of things I need to get\ud83d\ude02 that sounds awesome", "19 was for college yes", "This made me laugh, I use litter liners and she actually left the liner with all the litter in it but took the litter box\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 literally everything but the poop", "Lmao", "It\u2019s fine she has other daughters. Lots of parents lose a kid. At least you got your car back", "I do not understand the N T A comments.\n\nYou state it was your sisters cat, she found it and looked after it until old sister comes home, presumably has more money and authority and essentially took her cat away and decided it's 'yours now because you came home'.\n\nYou even say in your edit that she never agreed the cat was yours just because you wanted it. \n\nIt's her cat, I hope the police laugh at you when you call them about this.\n\nYTA", "NTA. I'm happy you got Nova back in the end!", "NTA i would first try other means to get my cat back but if that didn't work within 24 hours , I would call the cops 100000000%", "So because there seems to be confusion and I don\u2019t want to make the post any longer, some clarification: Nova is My cat, Not my sister\u2019s, although both my sisters love nova very much. This isn\u2019t a my sister took the family pet situation, she\u2019s My cat who I do all the scooping of litter and feeding and bathing and brushing her teeth and all of it, in addition to paying for things she needs for that as well as vet care and any expenses the cat has. My sister works and did not do these things. The Entire family was on the same page about her being my cat, I had thought she(17 sister)was as well but evidently she was not. The sister(19) who originally found her and was originally paying for all of her care for only two months, which I have been for about a year now, agreed that she was my cat as well. She (17 sister) was told multiple times if she wanted to be able to say that nova was also her cat she needed to do at least something to take care of her. She never did. I didn\u2019t come here to argue over ownership of my cat, I came here because I wanted to know if I was an asshole if I called the cops which thank god I didn\u2019t wind up having to, and to find out what else maybe I could do besides that course of action. She\u2019s also nearly an adult, not a toddler. She literally moved out.\n\nSo no I did not Steal a Cat from a Child\nMy teenage younger sister Stole My Cat.\nI\u2019m just happy I have her back now.", "YTA because it sounds like she was your sisters cat FIRST, until you pretty much simply showed up and took over - so if anything, it sounds like *you* stole *her* cat. If you wanted a cat, you should have gotten your own instead of overtaking this one that was already being cared for.", "I\u2019m so glad to see that comment. I thought exactly the same when I read the post, and when I saw all of the NTA I thought I was taking crazy pills.\n\nWho just comes home and takes over a cat that someone else has already been taking care of for *months* at that point!? OP should have gotten her own cat, if she wanted one.", "I have absolutely no authority over her, she has more money than me she literally just moved out, and I didn\u2019t \u2018decide\u2019 I ASKED to take responsibility and ownership of the cat when I moved back in to an absolutely disgusting litterbox I had to use a hose to get clean and her food bowl being filthy, and it had been a month of Only me taking care of her and buying food and litter already after I moved back in with nobody asking me to, no one else doing it or telling me they would. You\u2019re assuming shit you have no clue about. She\u2019s my cat, my sister did not adequately care for her and I was under the impression everyone in my family had agreed she was mine I was not aware of the disagreement until my cat was literally stolen. She didn\u2019t necessarily like it because she had to leave the cat and I understand that. I didn\u2019t like leaving my ex\u2019s dog when I had to move out but I understood that even though I pet him and love him, my ex paid for his dog food and fed him and walked him and got him his toys and that is his person and I can\u2019t take the dog with me just because I love him. And from what I understood she understood that she had to leave the cat here, because nova is not her cat, for the exact same reasons.", "Clearly you can\u2019t read. For the millionth time, MY SISTER DID NOT CARE FOR HER. When I moved in she had already been being neglected and I took care of her by myself for a month before I said hey this should be my cat if I\u2019m doing all of the work for her. And as far as I was aware everyone agreed. All my sister did was to give her pets, which is not nothing she does love the cat but she does not have responsibility or ownership of her. That is My cat.", "Where do you get \u201cupwards of $1500\u201d from? Unless that was some fancy breeder cat, a cat from Humane Society etc does not cost nearly that much.", "I know it's a typo but it's 4am and I'm giggling at the mental image of a car being flung through a front door", "NTA I'm glad your mom has your back.", "Eating donuts and creating new made up laws to arrest people with", "We all know there's only one kind of acceptable catnapping, and it's currently why I can't get up out of my seat. It'd take one hell of an emergency to make me remove the cat from my lap before he wants to leave.", "She loved her, but not enough to take care of her properly.  It sounds like there was a lapse in communication with her.  When you were taking over care and ownership there should have been a more clear conversation and agreement from BOTH your sisters that you were doing so.", "Post this in original post.", "It depends on location. In most places in the US, the cops will tell you this is a civil matter because it is two people from the same household fighting over the ownership of the cat, which means you have to go to small claims court for a judge to work out who owns the cat. OP would bring their documentation showing they\u2019ve paid for the cat for the past year, and the judge would most likely say the cat must be returned to OP."]}
