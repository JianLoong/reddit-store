My daughter is Skye and my niece is Robyn. My sister is Amy. So Amy was married to Robyn's dad for 5 years and he died when Robyn was 6 (they got married after Robyn was born). My sister struggled with the idea of being single and ended up dating a lot. In that time Robyn and Skye grew very close. The two are the best of friends and see each other more as sisters than cousins. Amy ended up in some shitty relationships after Robyn's dad and Robyn never liked any of them. Then when Robyn was 13 Amy met Jim and they got married 6 months in. Robyn acted out a lot at home at the time so Amy brought her to a therapist. When the therapist asked Amy to wait at least a year to get married to Jim she ended the therapy sessions and went ahead with the wedding. Robyn told her mom she never loved her dad and she was disgusted by her and she should just let her go somewhere else because she'll never play happy families with her and Jim.\n\nThings got worse when Amy and Jim had a baby when Robyn was 13 and another a few months ago.\n\nRobyn has not developed any relationship with her half siblings, she is standoffish to Jim, she's standoffish to Amy and Amy has told Robyn that she has a dad again and siblings and should be happy. Robyn told Amy that Skye is the only person who she'd ever call her sister and that Amy's kids are just her spawn, not her siblings and not her family.\n\nAmy approached Skye a month ago and asked her to talk Robyn around and told her she should be a good cousin to all three. Skye told Amy she did not want to fight with Robyn and wouldn't want to push anything on her. She asked about the younger cousins and Skye told her that her loyalty was with Robyn. Amy then went to Skye again and told her that she has so much power and that she would take Robyn away from her if she did not do what she asked. Skye agreed to bring it up to Robyn. Robyn told her she did not want to have anything to do with her half siblings and didn't want to talk about them. So Skye told Amy she'd do no more. Amy kept adding pressure to Skye which is when Skye told me. Skye said she had not wanted it to be a big deal. I told her I would take care of it.\n\nI told Amy I knew she had approached Skye and told her to leave my daughter out of it. Amy told me I should be telling Skye to get involved and why does nobody care about the younger two and only care about Robyn. I said she was not putting that on the shoulders of my 15 year old. Skye told me Amy tried again and I told Amy to leave my daughter alone. Amy repeated the same things as the previous time which is when I told her she could not use my daughter to make up for her poor decision making. Amy told me I was trying to punish her for moving on just like Robyn is and she told me I had no right to judge.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687460396, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gbrgu/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_not_using_my/", "score": 213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like you said, it's not the job of a 15 year old child to fix your sister's family issues. Protect your daughter and keep supporting your niece, who needs someone looking out for her in this situation.", "NTA. Your sister needs to deal with her family issues within her family and not drag your daughter into it. Robyn is 13, which is the absolute worst age for girls. No surprise here that she is acting out. Her mother should really have her in therapy to work through her emotions instead of pressuring her to embrace a new family. There could be many reasons for Robyn\u2019s decision. How do we know the new stepfather didn\u2019t do something? Robyn needs therapy and support from her mother.", "NTA your sister is a damn mess, her daughter just wanted to grieve in peace and have her mother there supporting her but she just refused", "NTA . Your doing the right thing . Amy is TA", "NTA - Your sister can\u2019t make a good choice. It\u2019s embarrassing for her daughter to witness. Robyn has zero trust in her own mom and never will. Poor kid.", "You can't force someone to like someone else.  If that other person is a good and decent person, maybe it will come in time.  Maybe it won't, particularly given the circumstances.  If they aren't, hopefully Robyn can still count on you and Skye to be her emotional support humans.  NTA.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like she's the one that's 15 years old, running around trying to manipulate things and get what she wants. Poor Robyn - I hope she has access to another therapist at some point soon because this is going to be some significant trauma her mother has hit her with.", "NTA. \n\nShe was wrong for involving your daughter without talking to you and then trying to manipulate you into doing the same once you found out what she did.  She should let Robyn be instead of putting pressure on her, it'll only make things worse.\nHer canceling therapy for Robyn raises questions honestly, I hope that she doesn't follow through with the threat she made about keeping Robyn away from Skye.", "NTA. Amy has already lost Robyn through her own shitty actions and will be one of those people wailing later on about how \"her daughter never talks to her and didn't invite her to her wedding.\"", "NTA. She should have waited like the therapist asks and she should have let her daughter continue therapy.", "**NTA**\n\nSend all of our love to Robyn, OP. What her mom is doing is pretty crappy and is showing Robyn how little she is respected in her own family. I can't believe that she wouldn't put the wedding off for a year to help Robyn grieve and accept that her family was going to change.", "NTA.", "OMG! How DARE Amy use and pressure a 15-year-old to make the amends for the misstakes she made when rushing into this marriage and rapidly producing babies even after being warned by her therapist. She knew how it was going to affect Robyn, and now a 15-year- old must fix it?\n\nNTA\n\nBut Oh my God your sister!!!", "NTA. Tell Amy that Robyn's feelings are her fault because she mishandled everything and ignored a therapist because she only cared about getting what she wanted instead of what is best for her daughter. That she should have been a better mother and now it's too late.", "NTA - you're totally right for telling Amy off. She shouldn't be threatening and manipulating a child to win over another child. \n\nI do think it'd be beneficial if you tried being a bit more sympathetic towards Amy though. It sounds like she is really trying to fix what she believes is a broken family. Trying to understand her perspective could help ease the tension.\n\nThink of how you'd feel if Skye suddenly lost her father. You could easily feel desperate enough to look for another person to help keep your home life functioning. \n\nThat's what my own mother did when my dad had an affair. She re-married someone that I believe is a total ass, but she did it partly because she believes that I deserve a father figure. Even though the person she chose is a poor excuse for a father, she is right. Children typically grow up easier when they have two supportive parents. \n\nAmy's sadness and loneliness is probably blinding her from the fact that Jim might not be the right person to fill the empty role in her home. Sympathizing with her feelings of grief and confusion could help steer her towards the realization that you can't force a child to accept someone else at their father.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
