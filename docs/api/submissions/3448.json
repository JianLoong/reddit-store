He usually did all the cooking for holidays and was a really good cook. \n\nThis year his family decided everyone would make a dish and bring it. MIL sent a group text to organize what everyone was bringing. My husbands sister immediately said she would be making the stuffing from her dads recipe. Everyone called other dishes by the time I got to the text I was assigned green beans, cranberry sauce , and sweet potatoes. \n\nMy husband loves this cornbread stuffing I make we were hoping I would get to make it this year. We are both sick of his sister always getting her way and no one consulted me I was just assigned whatever was left. I asked if I could make the stuffing instead but his sister said she really wanted to make the stuffing recipe . MIL asks I just bring what was assigned. I decided screw it my husband wants it so I decided to make my stuffing anyway. \n\nI showed up with my stuffing and at dinner we had a lot of stuffing, rolls, turkey, liquor and dessert. \n\nMIL was upset with us for not bringing what he were assigned and thanksgiving dinner was mostly stuffing. As we were leaving MIL asked why we couldn\u2019t just go along with things this year but I feel like I should have been consulted about what I wanted to make just because his sister needed to have her way.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You don't have to ruin the first Thanksgiving since FIL does over it", "YTA. Her first thanksgiving without her dad and she wanted to make his stuffing. Clearly to feel close to him and have a part of him there. \n\nYou WERE consulted, not assigned. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s fault you didn\u2019t get the text message in time to pick what you wanted. \n\nAnd lastly, you ALSO didn\u2019t bring what you were asked to bring. \n\nYou\u2019re the Grinch who shat all over an already hard Thanksgiving. Your poor MIL, she\u2019s probably absolutely exasperated with you.", "YTA, you were asked to bring specific things so there wouldn\u2019t be a ton of one thing. It\u2019s the first year without their father, of course they want his recipe. You were selfish and just made yourself look like an AH. You legitimately ruined the dinner, and don\u2019t even feel bad. That\u2019s unbelievable.", "YTA for your shitty communication", "YTA\n\nYou didn't bring what you were assigned and decided to make something else. At the very least, you should have brought the assigned dishes too. So now they are short 3 dishes but have 2 stuffings which are unnecessary. Why didn't you just make a stuffing and leave it at home?", "YTA you could have made your stuffing and enjoyed it at your own home. This family just lost their father and the daughter wanted to make his stuffing recipe.", "YTA\u2026 you could have made the stuffing in addition to the other dishes if it was really that important to you. You were aware others were expecting the assigned dishes. Sometimes that\u2019s part of the holiday. If everyone is helping out that\u2019s what you do. What you were assigned. It\u2019s called being family. Yes it\u2019s more work to make one more dish but really people may have appreciated your stuffing if they had the other dishes as well. You were petty and small about this.\n\nEdited for clarity on number of dishes*", "They were grieving their family member who always cooked the thanksgiving dinner\u2026by making a recipe that would taste like his cooking, which can be a massive comfort when grieving. You didn\u2019t have a single thought about the fact that they\u2019re grieving over the holidays for the first time, huh? YTA.", "Why not just make what you were asked AND the stuffing?  \n\nInstead you made it all about you getting your way. This was neither the time nor the place to pull some weird entitled flex move.  \n\nYour husbands family is grieving, YTA", "YTA. If you had made the dishes assigned to you and the stuffing, that would be fine. Instead, no one made those dishes because they expected you to do your part. You could have at least said you weren't going to be bringing those dishes. This was just childish.", "YTA You do realize the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you and what you want, right??", "YTA. You could have made your stuffing at home for husband. You could have made your stuffing AND your assigned dishes. You could have showed a little grace since your SIL wanted to make your deceased FILs recipe at the first thanksgiving without her dad! There are a lot of ways you could have made this better.... you chose not to. That makes you the AH", "YTA. Who wants to go to a Thanksgiving with no cranberry sauce or sweet potatoes??? You effed up Thanksgiving for everyone. You suck OP", "YTA. You should have made the things you were assigned and the stuffing if your husband wanted it", "YTA. If you weren\u2019t going to bring what you were assigned you should have said so. Childish.", "YTA. You were given 3 rather important side dishes of a thanksgiving supper that you didn\u2019t bother to make or even tell anybody you weren\u2019t making. You didn\u2019t kind of ruin dinner, you really did. Stuffing, stuffing, and rolls alongside the Turkey. That\u2019s a pretty crappy thanksgiving, on top of FIL being gone. You should have let SIL make her father\u2019s recipe. You\u2019re a guest in their home and you wanted to throw a fit over what? Stuffing. Strange hill to die on.", "YTA if you didn't make the dishes you were assigned as well as the stuffing.\nAnd super selfish to make this about SIL \"getting her way\" instead of, you know, mourning her father. And for basically blowing off your MILs request. And the text for long enough for \"everything else to get called.\"\nBasically all the way around.", "yta your FIL passed away and this was the first thanksgiving without them would it have killed you to just go along with it this year? did you really have ti cause drama over stuffing? make the stuffing and eat it home if your husband really wants it.. or at the very least make the rest of the stuff you were supposed to make and the stuffing if you felt the need to cause problems. you didn\u2019t exactly tell them you weren\u2019t going to listen and do the stuffing anyway  you whining about them\nnot consulting you well you are no better at consulting them then they were you.", "Yta. You\u2019re selfish.", "YTA \n\nYou WERE consulted, you were just too busy to notice until it was too late. \n\nYour SIL (who you seem to hate) is grieving her dad. \n\nYour MIL is grieving her husband. \n\nYou? You\u2019re just behaving like an insolent child.", " yta an in the words of tyra \u201cI WAS ROOTING FOR YOU. WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU.\u201d", "Yta  not for bringing the stuffing, but for not bringing the sweet potatoes. \n\nHad you brought your staffing and then taken home the leftovers in addition... \n\nWhere was your husband in this? He could have taken over the green beans. They aren't too hard.", "YTA. You were asked to make green beans, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce, but instead made stuffing and nothing else. So the others were deprived of the full, traditional Thanksgiving meal they were looking forward to. They were counting on you for those dishes, and you let them down because you wanted to show up your SIL because you're jealous of her. If you had made the assigned dishes as well as the extra stuffing you would be NTA. \n\nThe first holiday after a family member dies is difficult, and re-creating that loved one's favorite recipes is a comfort to the bereaved. You showed them his memory isn't important to you.", "YTA. This was mean-spirited and set everyone up to have a Thanksgiving without the dishes they expected. There was absolutely nothing in the universe preventing you from making the stuffing your husband likes and ... eating it with your husband. A borderline okay solution would have been the stuffing in addition to the meals you were assigned. You asked if you could bring stuffing instead and were specifically asked to bring the items assigned. \n\nAlso not sure why you feel like you should be consulted about your in-laws' way of grieving the loss of your father-in-law. Your SIL can maybe get her way. Your husband wasn't even cooking, so it isn't like he has some huge horse in the game besides apparently just not wanting his sister to have anything she wants.", "YTA \nRight you wanted to make your stuffing. Fine, there could have been two. But why didn\u2019t you make the other stuff too? You made sure everyone else went without? That\u2019s AH behaviour right there. \n\nYou got your own way but at the cost of everyone else.", "ESH :  The family is asses for not really consulting you and dumping you with stuff no one wanted, but you are the asshole for kinda screwing everything up for your own ego. if you had brought stuffing \\*in addition to\\* the things you were assigned you'd be in a much stronger position here, op, but as is you're probably the biggest ass, because you screwed everyone over to do what you wanted, the same thing you claim the SIL did to you.", "[deleted]", "ESH\n\nIf you absolutely did not want to bring what you were assigned without being asked you could have decided not to go, make what was assigned, heck even store bought and brought your stuffing in addition to. \n\nAll the choices yet you choose to be an AH.", "YTA. You could have brought all three, but decided to make it about you. I have baked professionally, but because I'm 'one of the grandkids' I was always assigned a vegetable dish. I was a little salty about that and took it as a challenge to make veggies that people don't typically like into some pretty fantastic concoctions.", "YTA. \"Gosh, they're all behaving as if this first Thanksgiving without their beloved patriarch and his traditional meal is about honouring HIM, or something. I mean, what about ME? Huh? Wouldn't this be a a great time to assert MYself? Maybe get some petty revenge? Me me me, with a side order of me!", "Yea this solution seems so obvious and easy that OP absolutely had to know that making her own dish would create drama and make the holiday all about her. It's a classic \"mean girl\" move. It's especially disrespectful and selfish because it's the first holiday after the FIL death. \n\nYTA", "Absolutely this. Also, if the stuffing was so important to you and your husband that you just *had* to bring it, why didn't you bring it along with the other items you were assigned? Or at least told your MIL that you'd be bringing stuffing instead and tough shit for SIL? That way, they'd at least know to assign someone else to those dishes. Your husband could even have talked to his mom about your bringing your stuffing but it should have been *in addition* to what you were assigned. It's too bad you didn't get to the text quickly enough; perhaps next year, you can have an agreement with your husband that he should respond with what you want to bring so this doesn't happen again. That is, if you're invited. If not, you'll be happy to know that you can make your husband's favorite stuffing for yourselves. In fact, you could have done that this year, too. Go to Thanksgiving, eat what is available, take home some leftovers (sans stuffing) and then make your stuffing for the two of you to enjoy with your leftovers. See how easy that is? Instead, you decided to make the hill you die on the one where your husband's grieving family wants to honor FIL by taking over his job and making the dishes that help them remember him on a special holiday. YTA and so is your husband for not stepping in to prevent upsetting his family for something so petty.", "Yup. Same. She really needed to make the assigned dishes in addition to the stuffing. YTA op.", "exactly. if OP had brought the stuffing as well as the sides they were supposed to bring, it probably wouldn\u2019t have been an issue to have 2 stuffing options.", "And MIL\u2019s words tell me this isn\u2019t the first time OP has been unnecessarily petty or difficult. \u201cWhy we couldn\u2019t just go along with things this year.\u201d", "this! It would be one thing if OP made what was required AND stuffing, but to not even half heartedly bring their share....", "not enough salt.", "Yeah, exactly. This was their first Thanksgiving without your FIL, and his daughter wanted to make *his* recipe to honor him. It's not about her \"getting her way\" or whatever. If she really had her way, her dad would still be there to make the food, but you made it about *your* way because you think your stuffing is better--as if that matters at all.\n\nYTA.", "LITERALLY no vegetable, unless there was pumpkin pie. Smh. Also, happy Cake Day!", "Exactly - and she was consulted. She was just the slowest to read the group text and got what was left. I\u2019m pretty sure if she made what was requests (the easiest dishes by the way) no one would have been annoyed if she also brought another type of stuffing.", "Disagree that\u2019s a completely normal way of assigning who brings what.  Also she was assigned relatively cheap items comparatively.\n\nI think whoever brought turkey good enough.  We don\u2019t know how many desserts were brought and who brought how many.  They can also get expensive.", "Did you read the whole post? She also decided not to make what she was assigned, which are also thanksgiving staples, which the whole family then had to go without.  There\u2019s never too much stuffing and multiple options are great, but wtf. OP made a spite move. She\u2019s an asshole and messed up thanksgiving.", "It wasn't just that there was double stuffing; they didn't bring the other dishes they ended up with. Maybe actually read the post first", "Ohai bot who just stole my comment! First time it's happened, I suppose I should be flattered?", "Bot. Comment stolen from u/shoereader"]}
