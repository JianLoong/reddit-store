He usually did all the cooking for holidays and was a really good cook. \n\nThis year his family decided everyone would make a dish and bring it. MIL sent a group text to organize what everyone was bringing. My husbands sister immediately said she would be making the stuffing from her dads recipe. Everyone called other dishes by the time I got to the text I was assigned green beans, cranberry sauce , and sweet potatoes. \n\nMy husband loves this cornbread stuffing I make we were hoping I would get to make it this year. We are both sick of his sister always getting her way and no one consulted me I was just assigned whatever was left. I asked if I could make the stuffing instead but his sister said she really wanted to make the stuffing recipe . MIL asks I just bring what was assigned. I decided screw it my husband wants it so I decided to make my stuffing anyway. \n\nI showed up with my stuffing and at dinner we had a lot of stuffing, rolls, turkey, liquor and dessert. \n\nMIL was upset with us for not bringing what he were assigned and thanksgiving dinner was mostly stuffing. As we were leaving MIL asked why we couldn\u2019t just go along with things this year but I feel like I should have been consulted about what I wanted to make just because his sister needed to have her way.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was bummed, but I went all out and had some of the younger kids who asked to dress as waiters serving everyone as they arrived. The drinks looked amazing. Just make the best out of what you get.", "Don\u2019t forget Romeo and Julienned Potatoes.", "Garbage green bean casserole\n\nLol", "Info: i guess you showed SIL huh? Congratulations, was it worth it?", "You messed up the second you didn\u2019t make the other dishes you were asked to make.\nYou could\u2019ve made the stuffing while also bringing the dishes you were asked to make. It\u2019s not difficult. And because you didn\u2019t, that makes you an AH.", "We see you complaining about her always getting her way, but your actions say you doth protest too much. \n\nYTA.", "Spoken like someone that has never planned a giant potluck for a holiday dinner.", "This what I was thinking first holiday season with out FIL who did all the cooking so a way to have him be apart of the feast was his stuffing \n\nYTA", "The big joke at thanksgiving this year was if anyone asks what they can bring, say vegetables! I made the turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes & gravy. I bought enough vegetables for 2 people. 4 more got invited. We have plenty of food. Including dessert! But definitely not enough vegetables!", "Some of us don't want to eat food that's been shoved inside a dead bird. (I'm a vegetarian and I love stuffing.)", "Do we even know her husband actually cares about who makes the stuffing though?", "This is the one for me, that's the worst part of the whole thing lol.", "Cornbread stuffing is delicious!! Try it if you ever get the chance(if you like cornbread that is) OP you were consulted, you either didn\u2019t respond right away, or were too busy etc to answer, what\u2019s that old saying \u201cyou snooze you loose?\u201d If you had made the other stuff as well maybe you would have gotten a pass, but for the sake of the family grieving the loss of a loved one? Too keep his food alive is awesome, sister wanted to do her dad proud, you and your husband should support that, whether or not she \u201calways\u201d gets her way, also would it have been to hard to call mother in law and say I\u2019m also going to bring some cornbread stuffing, I don\u2019t want to step on anyone\u2019s toes, but your son really wants this as well. YTA", "Hahhahah I\u2019m so happy to be apart of this Reddit inside joke", "Like Phoebe and the cups and ice lol", "Way to ruin the first Thanksgiving Dinner without your FIL. Those firsts are always difficult. \n\nWhy didn't you bring the other items you were assigned to bring? Your husband could still have eaten your cornbread stuffing, while the rest of the family ate the stuffing from FIL's recipe. Then you could have taken the cornbread stuffing leftovers home so hubby could eat it the rest of the week.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  You were late to the group text, so you didn't get to choose.  You should have made your stuffing IN ADDITION to cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes, and green beans.  Those 3 vegetables would have taken what, 60 minutes?  Then all the dishes would have been covered and you could have made the stuffing for your husband.  \nYou could also make the cornbread stuffing for your husband the other 364 days of the year!  \nYou didn't want to be consulted - you wanted to make cornbread stuffing and you didn't want your SIL to be able to choose what she wanted to make.  You should have stayed home.", "They didn't ask it to be fancy. She could have brought canned cranberry sauce or made husband do it since it's HIS family. She got the easy stuff. Mom deciding daughter could bring stuffing is not SIL \"getting her way\". This is why I'm glad in my household we don't do turkey. I go to the butcher the day before and get the best filet mignon for my husband and kid, a lobster for my husband and me, and an additional salmon for myself, and make asparagus, baked potatoes and  a homemade mac and cheese. It's expensive and we don't have leftovers unfortunately but that's how we do it at home. If I was showing up at family Thanksgiving, I'd bring what I was asked. If I wanted to bring something ADDITIONAL it would be fine. If someone asked for something super fancy someone didn't know how to make, then it would be ok to complain. I don't know where OP gets off going behind backs and asking MIL to tell HER daughter not to bring dad's stuffing simply cause brother's wife is throwing a hissy. Thanksgiving goes alot smoother if you try to get along. It's not like these people are sitting down to dinner with someone who molested them as a child or tried to break up their marriage. All this is over a side dish.", "I personally call it stuffing (not stuffed into anything but my belly) because so many people look at you funny if you say dressing (the other word I would know to call it). I find it quicker & easier to use the wrong term sometimes, vs taking the time to explain the meaning of the correct word. But that\u2019s just my personal experience.", "The pot-luckiness just has to do with time, effort, and kitchen size.  A lot of families have one person cooking the entire meal.", "I attend two family Thanksgivings, one with my husband's family on Thursday and one with my family over the weekend (so everyone else can also go to their partners/other side of the family's Thanksgiving).\n\nBoth Thanksgivings have potlock aspects. My husband's side of the family everyone makes and brings things and my side of the family the host does most of it but several people bring specific things (like uncle so-and-so makes the pies). In my family we do do a rather traditional meal with a turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie, etc. My husband's has no turkey, it's all the proteins people like and volunteered to cook or bring (they don't like turkey). I've also been part of several friendsgivings or work thanksgiving potlucks.\n\nWhat I've never been part of is a group Thanksgiving where someone told me what I HAD to bring. I do find that somewhat odd and rude. However, I do think OP was oddly sneaky about it. Like, if they didn't want to cook things they were assigned (again, weird to me) by their husband's family they should have just said no. Not said nothing and cooked something else and brought it? This gave no one a chance to bring these things themselves thinking OP would make them.\n\nAlso, yeah, it seems to be on OP to cook for her husband's families meal. Did OP's husband not know or notice she wasn't making those things? Did it not occur to him to do so?", "This. Sheesh, play the long game. You are gonna be married to this person for a long time; you've got many years to get to make the stuffing.", "Yeah, it doesn\u2019t matter what it\u2019s called really. It\u2019s kind of a savoury bread pudding type of thing and it sounds fine. I definitely cook mine in a bird, but really that\u2019s partly for the convenience! You don\u2019t need a recipe and it always turns out that way.", "Or make stuffing and just eat it at home with your husband if you want it so bad. OP could have still taken her assigned dishes to the family dinner and not make this all about her.", "Yes, you don't get it. What does OP care about a dead old man. I mean only bc it was her husbands dad and a beloved member of the family she is invited for thanksgiving doesn't mean the world should stop revolving around her, doesn't it? Her life mantra obviously is me, me, me, so why do you expect someone like OP respecting the grief and wishes of her inlaws when HER wishes obviously were more important?", " Because none of those sides are overly complicated. A turkey would take way longer to prep and cook than the sides. Stuffing is also a complicated recipe unless OP is making packet stuffing which seems likely.", "Cranberry sauce is literally opening a can and heating it. Green beans is beans and garlic, sweet potatoes too, just season them and stick them in the oven. If you've ever stepped foot in the kitchen you'd realise that not all dishes require and equal amount of effort. The person cooking the turkey has the hardest job. Stuffing too can be complicated depending upon the recipe. OP was literally given the easiest dishes to make.", "She could have even made it in addition. But either her or her husband needed to cook a can of green beans and bring some cranberry sauce.", "But then you don't make the fancy cranberry sauce. You buy the type in the can so you can make green beans. Or maybe you just steam the green beans so you have time to make Auntie's sauce. \n\nGreen beans are pretty simple, and cranberry sauce can be. We also don't know that everyone else only got one dish. Hell, even SIL may have claimed more than one.", "Ok. But was anyone else asked to bring three dishes? I literally just want to know the numbers I don't know why this is making people upset", "The stuffing thing is so weird to me but your comment finally helps me understand.  When we cook the bird the stuffing is stuffed inside, so making the stuffing is just part of cooking the bird... I didn't get the logistics of 2 different people bringing stuffing to an event with 1 turkey (plus how long would everyone then have to wait for the turkey to cook?)\n\nEditing to add info, as I think I am offending people: I'm in Australia. We don't do thanksgiving but many British  traditionalists (eg my partner's family) will cook a turkey for Christmas day, and the turkey will usually have some sort of stuffing inside to make the meat more flavoursome and tender.  I had never heard of eating the stuffing separately before reading reddit, but it sounds like it is a different type of dish than what \"stuffing\" means here in Australia.", "These are really all of the easiest dishes IMO.", "> I can just imagine OP\u2019s post if she brought the only stuffing and it wasn\u2019t FIL\u2019s recipe that everyone was expecting.\n\nExactly what I was thinking.  Totally YTA.", "He just died this year. God forbid SIL want to make a sentimental dish on her first thanksgiving without her father. Jfc.", "Yeah, they do a thing where they essentially make a savoury bread pudding and call it \u201cstuffing\u201d.  Sounds lovely; not how I make it. There\u2019s a lot of Thanksgiving drama on Reddit now for obvious reasons, and as a Canadian I do make a big Thanksgiving dinner in October, but it seems different somehow\u2014a lot more just using up the last harvest to come out of the garden.\n\nWe (in my group) also tend not to do the cultural thing where guests bring food they cooked to my house for dinner. Usually, if I invite people to dinner, I cook, because it\u2019s my dinner, and nobody (friends or family) has ever tried to show up with food to my dinner party. Reddit has shown me there are really different cultural expectations around this (that often cause unexpected offence!). Some families think it\u2019s rude to show up as a guest to someone\u2019s house without having brought something you cooked\u2014to the point where they will bring something even if it gives offence and people beg them not to. Some people expect their guests to be sous chefs and will email out lists of who is bringing what (like OP\u2019s family\u2014and because that seems to be the cultural expectation here, I decided OP was TA for not following it even though I personally would be flabbergasted to receive such a text from my own family members). Some people like to plan their menus to the last detail and are deeply offended if somebody brings as much as a bottle of wine to their party.\n\nI think in disputes like these it is important to know how deeply rooted the \u201cguest/host/collective eating\u201d rituals are in a family or a culture, and that a little patience and indulgence is needed if people from two different expectation groups marry. There will always be feelings of taboo as you break your host/guest social norms.", "Speaking of, I've heard there have been vicious family divides between whether Ham-let or Turkey Andronicus is the proper traditional main feature.", "Besides, OP could make the stuffing some other time. It's not a rule that you can't make stuffing on days other than Thanksgiving.", "Also note that stuffing and dressing are the same thing, except when they aren't. English makes no sense.", "Made me laugh.", "OMG I always claim drinks at get togethers, I love making festive cocktails and mocktails and using fun glasses and ice!!", "Lol. Anyone got a link?"]}
