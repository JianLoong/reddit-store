She\u2019s a perfect little girl and I was so excited to have my family meet her. I have three older sisters who all have kids as well. A fun tradition that my family does is to have a small get together once the baby is about 2-3 months old. We don\u2019t announce the baby\u2019s name until after the birth to make it a surprise. At the little party we give the parents a bunch of little gifts that have the new baby\u2019s name on them. My grandmother always quilts a beautiful baby blanket and embroiders the baby\u2019s name. She\u2019s done this for all my sisters and cousins. The issue is the name my husband and I chose for our daughter. \n\nFor context, my grandma has a unique history with her own name. She was born as \u201cLucille\u201d but from the time she was 8 she told every single person she met that her name was Barbara. She did this for years until even her family called her Barbara. She even got her name legally changed. When I was a child I always asked her why she changed it. She simply said she liked Barbara better. It became a family joke, but she never seemed upset about it and always laughed with us. \n\nMy husband\u2019s grandmother raised him from when he was a baby to when she passed away when he was 19. Her favorite celebrity was Lucille Ball. She and my husband used to watch \u201cI love Lucy\u201d all the time together. He misses her very much and said that he would love to honor her in some way. Her name was Mary but we chose to have that as our daughters middle name. We decided that Lucy is a name we both loved and would honor his grandmother and maybe make mine chuckle a bit. \n\nAfter I gave birth me and my husband were FaceTiming my entire family when we announced the name. A few of my relatives laughed and said it was cute but my grandma was dead silent. When I asked her what was wrong she demanded to know why I chose Lucy. I was shocked and confused. I began to try and explain but she suddenly hung up. This greatly dampened the mood. My grandma wouldn\u2019t answer any calls from me afterwards. I asked my oldest sister and she said that my grandma was apparently offended and thought we were mocking her. She said she\u2019s not coming to the party in a few weeks to meet my daughter in person and that she\u2019s not giving the baby quilt to us unless we apologize and change our daughters name. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s escalated so much. My grandma has always been kind. I have no idea what to do. Births in my family are always celebrated and happy events but this has ruined it. I almost feel like some of my relatives are ignoring me because they don\u2019t want to \u201cpick sides\u201d but I don\u2019t even understand why there\u2019s a fight. Dealing with this along with my newborn has been incredibly stressful. My family is puzzled as well but most of them are saying I shouldn\u2019t have chosen a name I knew my grandmother disliked or at least asked her about it first.

Change your childs name to appease a woman who wont explain and wont be around long, or name your child what you want and not have a quilt or good will from your Grandma.\n\nIt could be that in time your Grandma will settle down, but perhaps she wont ever.\n\nIts your choice, but whatever you choose youre Not the Aholes.", "You asked her why she didn\u2019t like her original name, all she said was she liked Barbara better.

It's also 100% out of line for her to demand you change your daughter's name.", "NTA. This name holds a lot of meaning for you and your husband. I also think your daughter will be happy to learn about the origin of her name. :) Your grandmas strong reaction indivates that she probably strongly disliked her old name Lucille, but how could you have known? She needs to communicate her feelings, but since she's ignoring you, well, she's kind of the AH a little bit. Her feelings may be justified, but she needs to realise that this is hurting you and your relationship to her. I don't understand why your family is on her side here. Just because your grandma hated having that name doesn't mean she has to hate for someone else to have that name. Stay strong. When she's ready i'm sure she'll contact you, so you can talk it out. :)", "NTA\n\nWhat you & your husband choose to call the wean is up to you, if your grandma has an issue that's on her.\n\nHer actions I'm guessing come fae some sort of trauma associated with her real name but if she won't explain what that trauma is then she can't expect you to change the weans name, keep the name you chose and leave it up to her to change her mind and see her great grandchild or continue to be stubborn and never meet her.", "NTA.  This unreasonable and over-the-top reaction from your grandmother doesn't make sense.  She will need to either get over it or at least come up with an explanation for it.

Neither of my grandfather's or my grandmother's go by their names. 1 went by their middle name, 2 went by shortened names, that are also names in their own right, and 1 went by a name that someone gave him as a joke and it stuck.

It\u2019s not subject to a veto by others.", "It makes me sad how little compassion there is here.  As several people have pointed out, to have such an extreme reaction to this announcement, along with the avoidance of explaining her name change, it strongly suggests some profound trauma for the grandmother associated with the name. \n\nDoes this mean OP has to change her baby's name? No. But it also is unfair to label the grandmother as childish, ridiculous, an asshole, horrible, etc. without understanding her context. By OP's description, it sounds like this is very out of character for her, which strengthens the likelihood that there's deep pain behind this outburst.\n\nNAH unless further info suggests otherwise. I feel for OP because it's clearly been hurtful, but I'm quite worried about the grandmother's wellbeing and hope someone (perhaps not OP in the first instance) checks in on her", "NTA you and your husband can name your daughter anything the two of you agree on.

NTA  on your part - you chose a name without any malice and this is a curve ball to you.  Grandma needs to communicate a little at least to allude to why Lucille or even Lucy is such a horrible reminder of her past she cannot look at your daughter without that being the first thought she has.\nTBF not blaming grandma here either without further info - just a different way of dealing with things - that generation tends to push down the negative memory (however horrific) and pretend it never happened. Certainly not healthy but guessing she is late 70s / 80s? Not going to change now", "NTA but there's probably some trauma there for your gran, I hope you're able to talk to her about it properly and reconcile.", "NTA my paternal grandmother hated my name so much when I was born she called me \u201cbaby\u201d for a year before getting over it. Bottom line is it\u2019s not her kid not her choice.", "So I have a similar story but it\u2019s about my name.\n\nMy Grandpa had a sister who had been abused by their parents and suffered terrible mental health and my grandpa cared for her until he had to go to WWII. She suicided while he was on duty.\n\nHe never said her name again, my grandma never knew she ever existed. It was simply too painful for him.\n\nWell I\u2019m born many decades later and my parents tell my grandparents my name, which, by chance, is his sister\u2019s name, and my grandpa had what looked like a stroke and went catatonic and was in hospital.\n\nThe story comes out, but by this time my name is announced, everyone knows it etc. grandpa was in his 80s - he was not capable of processing his trauma really.\n\nThe works around in my family was my Grandpa chose a name for me. It was added as a middle name, and everyone on my mum\u2019s side of the family called me by that name in grandpa\u2019s presence.\n\nWhen I was little I was told my mum\u2019s family used my Norwegian name, while dad\u2019s family used my Irish name. When I was a bit older I was told the full story. Grandpa and I were very close, and although he never called me by my name, when he was dying and mentally not all there he called me \u201clittle bird\u201d and \u201cdarling sister\u201d, so while he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say her name, the fact that I had it made him identify with me in a special way.\n\nHonestly NAH, because it\u2019s clear your grandma has some kind of deep trauma, but you did nothing wrong.", "NTA.\n\nThe name hold special meaning for your husband and is great story.  And Lucy is a beautiful name. \n\nIt's not even Lucille which was your grandma's name until she changed. She always felt like Barbara that is great and it's great she was able to choose that for herself. But she cannot choose names for other people. \n\nPerhaps her reasons are deeper than you know and  that is where the reaction stems from. Maybe not.

Not everything has to do with her. People really need to get over themselves.", "NTA\n\nI named my daughter Elizabeth. She now goes by Liz. I found out my FMIL\u2019s husband had an affair with her best friend named Elizabeth. She went by Liz. \n\nThe woman was a racist and didn\u2019t want any half breed asian grandkids, so I ignored her. I was equally petty when naming my son a few years later. \n\nShe demanded that her 5th grandson (yes 5th) should be named after HER father. My child also had to have a biblical middle name, but there was one name he wasn\u2019t allowed to have. So after I found out my husband volunteered me for a tubal ligation at her behest. I was literally in labor when I found this out. I filled out the birth certificate, hubby was at lunch with his family. He\u2019s named after my dad but goes by the biblical name she hates, Jacob.\n\nYes, I knew they were both asshole moves. But he started knocking me around during the 1st pregnancy, his mom knew, and it didn\u2019t stop until my parents got involved. Then he cheated during the second pregnancy.", "NTA. Commission a quilt from a local quilter. Grandma can go pout and refuse to deal with her own issues in a corner.", "NTA. Firstly, Lucille isn\u2019t the same name as Lucy. If your grandma felt so strongly about the name then she should have told you earlier, rather than just saying she liked Barbara better. Your grandmother is behaving appallingly. If she has genuine reasons, she should talk to you like an adult, rather than creating a family drama and making threats", "NTA, but there\u2019s something bothering Grandma. There\u2019s obviously more to the story that she hasn\u2019t told any of you.", "NTA\n\nShe is not telling you something. I have a feeling she was teased by the name Lucille and changed her name because of it. Or she had an issue with someone with that name. Maybe she thinks it is lower class or something. You need to talk to her. Ultimately though she will have to get used to the name and deal with it.", "There is something going on with your grandma and the name Lucille.   I\u2019d go have a Frank talk with her.", "Your grandma never said why she didn't like the name. You had no idea it would effect her like this. This is not your fault. Obviously, your grandma didn't tell the truth. There is a reason she doesn't like that name. It's not a reasonable reaction. It makes me wonder why she all of the sudden wanted a new name, maybe she didn't want to be herself anymore. It would also be a reason for such a strong reaction. And a reason for not admitting the real reason she changed her name. I'm sure you know where I'm going with this. I don't mean to upset you. It's just a good reason for her reaction. She doesn't want to hear a name that she associates with something terrible. An 8 yr old doesn't just up and change her name. There is more to it. Back in my day, we didn't tell anyone the bad things that would happen to us. We learned to deal with things the best way we could. You should talk to her or write her a letter.  You may even consider changing your baby's name or at least tell her you did.  This is just my opinion.", "NTA\n\nBut I'm going to hazard a guess that when Grandma said she \"liked Barbara better\" what she meant was Lucille reminds her of some traumatic abuse she has never wanted to share.\n\nGo have tea with your grandmother.\nTell her you are sorry for the hurt, that you absolutely had no idea she disliked Lucille so much. That she always said she simply preferred Barbara. And gently say, you can tell there's more to the story. \n\nMaybe she will tell you, maybe she won't, but she needs to know you love her and care to figure out how to handle it, and you and your husband will keep talking and figure it out.", "Info: how did you NOT realize this would be a problem? \n\nLike im sorry, I get that you just didn\u2019t realize, but HOW did you not realize? Do you not like her? Is there something more?", "Just like the first comment says, there's something about that name that bothers her that she isn't sharing, maybe she was assaulted or something happened and by changing her name, she feels like another person and is able to separate from her older self? I'd change it out of respect simply because there's something happening here.", "You don't seem to be grasping that there's a 'hidden' backstory to the whole Lucille name that neither your Mom or Grandma are willing to discuss and it's obviously a sore subject for the two of them.  While you're NTA for naming your kid whatever you want...KNOWING Mom legally changed her name, you should have explained to her what you were considering and/or if this would cause consternation.  It's obviously caused a problem...good luck navigating things from here.", "No one is the AH here.  The name means something special to your husband.  But something happened to your grandma when she was 8 years old. Whatever it was it was a major trauma that made her want to change her name and reinvent herself.  Someone needs to talk to her so she can get the help she needs; it does not matter as she most likely has PTSD from this.", "Question for OP:\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you communicate with your grandma at all that you were going to name your daughter with a version of her birth name? Of the name she abandoned when she was 8?\n\nOf course you\u2019re NTA for choosing the name; however, not even communicating with grandma about it was not necessarily the respectful way to go about it.\n\nI can understand her thinking it\u2019s weird and wondering.\n\nEDIT: I understand the family has a tradition about not announcing the name until after the birth. That tradition doesn\u2019t preclude discussing it with a family member who was born with a version of that name and then changed it for personal reasons.", "NAH- I'm surprised you felt comfortable enough to use the name without digging further into why your Grandmother changed it. Seems like a sensitive topic. It's certainly tongue in cheek. Misunderstandings happen in life.", "Gut feeling is NTA and overly dramatic Grandmother.\n\nQuestion - Did you know she didn't like the name?  Why does she assume the name has anything to do with her?", "NTA. Grandma hasn't chosen to share any reason why she dislikes the name. Apparently, she's never even said that she dislikes it, only that she likes another better. If that's the case, then her reaction is dramatic and ridiculous. \n\nMy parents shared the name they had chosen for me before I was born. My grandmother threw a fit because it wasn't the *same*, but was *similar* to my aunt's ex that my grandmother hated (note that my aunt didn't care). Like, for example, if his name were Carlton and they wanted to name me Carla. My mother gave in and changed it to keep the peace - and then I had to hear about how salty she was because she \"didn't just name *my* baby what I wanted to!\" for the rest of her life.\n\nThat said, based on the reaction seeming to be so out of character, if Grandma shares the true reason why she hates the name, and it's due to some terrible trauma, it might be worth considering a name change. Her suddenly wanting a different name at age eight could be a coping mechanism in reaction to an assault or other abuse.", "NTA but I have so many questions.  You don\u2019t tell anyone the baby\u2019s name until they are 3 months old?! What are they calling the baby until then?! You aren\u2019t using the baby\u2019s name in front of them?", "Mail her a letter explaining why you and hubs chose the name, how you didn\u2019t intend to give the impression you were mocking her, and how confused and hurt you are by her response.

You cannot control if she comes around or not and there\u2019s likely something surrounding her name that she hasn\u2019t shared with you.\n\nEither learn to quilt/embroider and make a blanket or splurge on one. If you make it, make one for Lucy\u2019s baby down the road and carry the tradition through you. If you buy one, buy two and leave the name on the second one blank. When Lucy is older you can have her baby\u2019s name embroidered on the blanket that matches the one she had as a baby. It can be special this way even if it\u2019s purchased. \n\nDon\u2019t converse with family about it, don\u2019t feed into it, just mail a thoughtful letter, breathe, and enjoy these moments with baby.\n\nNTA, but continue to be gentle in your response moving forward.", "INFO: does your grandma have a lisp? I know it might not sound like a big deal to a lot of people. But I have one and I have a \u201cs\u201d in the middle of my name and was relentlessly teased about it growing up. It got to a point where I was embarrassed to say my name out loud.", "NTA\n\nWrite a social media post on why the name was chosen just like you told us it was for \"I love Lucy\". It was a connection for your husband and his family.

Write grandmother a letter about how the name came about, how it isn't fair for her to take her trauma out on an infant, and how she has hurt your and failed you as a grandmother. Make a copy for yourself.\n\nIf your family isn't willing to wade in for your precious princess, then maybe change the guest list to only those friends and family that are willing to stand up and protect your infant.

She was a revolutionary and may your daughter be just as awesome.", "I'm so sorry that this is happening. I think other comments are correct, and there is likely trauma associated with the name for your grandma.\n\n Maybe a compassionate handwritten  letter that she can read in her own time would be a good move. You and your partner can explain the deep connection that he had with his grandmother and your reasons for choosing the name for your beautiful baby. And you can tell your grandmother how much you love and value her (because it sounds like you truly do, and that is such a beautiful thing), how saddened you are that she is hurt by this, and also how hurt you are by how this has played out. Write it from your hearts and fill it with compassion and love, do your absolute best to avoid judgements and accusations.\n\nI really hope that this turns into an opportunity for you to learn more about each other, become closer, and for her to understand how much you love her. \n\nYou have a lot going on at the moment, and I know this is the last thing you need to be dealing with.

That in no way is the name that helps your partner feel connected to the amazing woman that raised him, is a slight against her. \n\nFor some reason, my grandmother went by her middle name, Wilma, rather than her first name, Stella. I find Stella to be a much more beautiful name, but I also know that my great grandmother was not a great mother to her. And I only slowly found this out with little stories and comments she would occasionally share. I also assured my grandmother that if I had ever met her mum, I would have put her in her bloody place! I remember when I told her that, she grinned and said she bet that I would have. Agh, I miss that woman. But she also had many faults, just like yours. \n\nI'm sending you all of the love, support, and hope that I possibly can.\n\nGive Lucy a little kiss on the head and let her know she is loved xx", "NAH  your grandma hates her name so much she came with a different name and legally changed it.

If she said \"Nope.\" then you can blast the family with \"Well I spoke with grandma on xyz day at xyz time and she said she had no problem with the name\".

I do say, since it\u2019s your grandma visit her and reassure her you love and respect her and would never intentionally do something that hurts her. Ask if she feels comfortable sharing why that name is so hurtful to her. I agree with another commenter that there\u2019s trauma there to illicit such a response.

This story is hilarious to me because my grandmother hung up the phone on my mom when she told her what name she and my dad had chosen for me.

She\u2019s a perfect little girl and I was so excited to have my family meet her. I have three older sisters who all have kids as well. A fun tradition that my family does is to have a small get together once the baby is about 2-3 months old. We don\u2019t announce the baby\u2019s name until after the birth to make it a surprise. At the little party we give the parents a bunch of little gifts that have the new baby\u2019s name on them. My grandmother always quilts a beautiful baby blanket and embroiders the baby\u2019s name. She\u2019s done this for all my sisters and cousins. The issue is the name my husband and I chose for our daughter. \n\nFor context, my grandma has a unique history with her own name. She was born as \u201cLucille\u201d but from the time she was 8 she told every single person she met that her name was Barbara. She did this for years until even her family called her Barbara. She even got her name legally changed. When I was a child I always asked her why she changed it. She simply said she liked Barbara better. It became a family joke, but she never seemed upset about it and always laughed with us. \n\nMy husband\u2019s grandmother raised him from when he was a baby to when she passed away when he was 19. Her favorite celebrity was Lucille Ball. She and my husband used to watch \u201cI love Lucy\u201d all the time together. He misses her very much and said that he would love to honor her in some way. Her name was Mary but we chose to have that as our daughters middle name. We decided that Lucy is a name we both loved and would honor his grandmother and maybe make mine chuckle a bit. \n\nAfter I gave birth me and my husband were FaceTiming my entire family when we announced the name. A few of my relatives laughed and said it was cute but my grandma was dead silent. When I asked her what was wrong she demanded to know why I chose Lucy. I was shocked and confused. I began to try and explain but she suddenly hung up. This greatly dampened the mood. My grandma wouldn\u2019t answer any calls from me afterwards. I asked my oldest sister and she said that my grandma was apparently offended and thought we were mocking her. She said she\u2019s not coming to the party in a few weeks to meet my daughter in person and that she\u2019s not giving the baby quilt to us unless we apologize and change our daughters name. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s escalated so much. My grandma has always been kind. I have no idea what to do. Births in my family are always celebrated and happy events but this has ruined it. I almost feel like some of my relatives are ignoring me because they don\u2019t want to \u201cpick sides\u201d but I don\u2019t even understand why there\u2019s a fight. Dealing with this along with my newborn has been incredibly stressful. My family is puzzled as well but most of them are saying I shouldn\u2019t have chosen a name I knew my grandmother disliked or at least asked her about it first.

If there is a trauma behind the name Lucille, it is incumbent upon grandma to explain that. She doesn\u2019t even have to share the details. Just say that there was a deeply hurtful trauma in her past, associated with Lucille or even Lucy, and that simply hearing either name just brings it all back.\n\nMost people, hearing even that limited explanation, would do everything they could to not retraumatize Grandma.\n\nEdit a misspelled word", "There might be a big significant reason why your gram hates that name.

That\u2019s all I was saying.", "I didn\u2019t, OP said the family has teased the grandmother about it for her entire life. \u201cIt became a family joke, but she never seemed upset about it and always laughed with us\u201d  and A lot of people laugh when uncomfortable and to keep peace. \n\nTo cut contact with someone implies it\u2019s there\u2019s a DEEP meaning behind it all. Then grandmother specifically told the sister they made a mockery of her. Seems this was her final breaking point. \n\nOP honestly seems more upset about not getting the blanket.. over the fact that she hurt grandmother.", "Yeah, you'll get caught in a reddit loop where all nuance is lost, and they'll want for OP to divorce the Grandmother and burn all quilts.", "She has just given birth and her grandmother blows up over this. Accusing her of being malicious (making a mockery would be malicious). Maybe, just maybe she hasn\u2019t got the energy for this drama right now? Maybe she should have spoken to her afterwards and explained why she was upset?\n\nBut she hasn\u2019t. She has cut them off and refused to rejoin the family group unless they change their newborns name - which has been picked with meaning. And will not explain. Just says they are mocking her. It is making other family members withdraw. \n\nIt is so overwhelming and stressful being a new mum. There was a family tradition - now scuppered, the name has been sullied, and her grandma is refusing contact unless she acquiesces. So they are upset, confused, hurt and annoyed. And stressed. All on top of having a newborn and all the stress that goes along with that. \n\nI\u2019d say the grandma was TA. Not the kindest thing to do was it?", "\ud83d\ude02 you are right", "For me, I value the people I love so\u2026 a variation of the name someone has legally separated from would never make my name list, ever. That\u2019s just common decency if you care about the relationship. \n\nBased on the extreme reaction, there\u2019s a deeper meaning. But I don\u2019t think people that feel disrespected generally care about respecting the other parties feelings ya know. It turns into you hurt me so I\u2019ll hurt you type of thing. Sometimes space helps so cruel words aren\u2019t spoken."]}
