You don't owe Mia loyalty, at least in the way she's referring to.  You explained clearly where you stood at the beginning of the whole thing and you stood by your word.  Loyalty with friends isn't having their side under any conditions.  Loyalty to friends is about being there when things are going sideways and they're having a rough time.  I would go so far as to say a loyal friend will call out their friends when they're wrong, which you sort of did, in a very gentle manner.   She's being immature, petty and manipulative and Jon needs to give her a reality check and he should probably tell Fay what's going on so Mia doesn't pull some significant BS in an attempt to end their relationship.", "NTA. You stated your boundaries clearly and didn\u2019t let Mia cross them. She knew this and is feeling pissy now because your boundaries haven\u2019t changed. Fay holding her own didn\u2019t help, but that\u2019s not your problem either. Fay needs a bit of maturing still.", "NTA, she's deflecting her anger on you because her biased and jealous behavior has no other place to express itself.\nBeing a friend does not mean supporting idiotic behaviors, on the contrary.", "Backed her for what? She's being an asshole to someone, who sounds pretty decent, because she's angry over a past relationship. This has nothing to do with loyalty. You're not going to badmouth someone you have no issue with because Mia is jealous. NTA. \n\n [This sounds like geek fallacies territory.](https://plausiblydeniable.com/five-geek-social-fallacies/)", "Not her proudest moment at all \ud83d\ude2d the worst part is she\u2019s actually a really great gal (not just saying it). Despite my shit eyesight, I can clearly see without my glasses that she might be a bit in love/infatuated with Jon and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s handling it well but also I REALLY just don\u2019t want to get involved.", "Yeah. Look I was in Fay's position once. And the Mia of that situation went after me relentlessly and sometimes kinda brutally, while continuing to deny she had any feelings for Jon, despite that being painfully obvious to everyone including Jon. and ugh it was suuuuch a mess.\n\nJust sooooo uncomfortable for everyone involved. \n\nPersonally, I'd say something to Mia about how unfair her behaviour is, and that it's pretty obvious where it's coming from, and that it isn't ok to take it out on you, but that's just me. There's no easy way to handle the situation, so maybe staying completely out is less messy, but it doesn't seem like Mia is going to let you do that either."]}
