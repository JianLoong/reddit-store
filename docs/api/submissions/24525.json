He will not go down without a fight, being cut out will mean he loses control and he will hate that with every fibre of his being, so brace yourselves for every tactic in the book.

It would take lawyers to have him removed and that\u2019s not happening right now. \n\nNo if he had paid she could not have kicked him out. \n\nSo unless you have something official stating how your right and I\u2019m wrong stop tagging me."]}
