Some background info, my brother and SIL have been dating on/off since they were 13/12 (they broke up in HS and got back together when they ended up working at the same company, different departments) and I\u2019m very close to both of them, they have often cooked for me, done movie nights with me etc. \n\nI\u2019d previously had discussions with my other sisters and SIL about how awful proposals at other peoples weddings are and even joked when I was chosen as a bridesmaid how I was the \u201canti-proposal guard\u201d.\n\nA work friend of my bro and SIL, we\u2019ll call him Alex and his GF Sophia had been together for a few years and were invited to the wedding. Later in the reception, I noticed him quietly talking to another guest and showed him a ring, to which if I hadn\u2019t joked about being \u201canti-proposal guard\u201d I wouldnt have paid much attention to it. About 10 mins later, sure enough he starts talking to his girlfriend and goes to kneel.\n\nThis is when I may be the AH; seeing this, I swoop in and grab his collar and say \u201cyou better not be doing what I think you\u2019re doing, freakazoid\u201d and he quickly stands up, to which I say something along the lines of \u201cthis is really rude to my family and I\u2019m happy for you but i\u2019d appreciate if you didn\u2019t do this here\u201d. He called me an AH but nothing else happened.\n\nTwo days later they got engaged and apparently told people the story because friends of Alex (I assume) started messaging me on instagram saying that what I did was rude and it wasn\u2019t my place, Alex particularly said I ruined the surprise and made a comment about me being a \u2018foolish autistic child\u2019. Sophia however said she was glad because she hated public proposal but said I was patronising to her fianc\u00e9. \n\nI feel a little awful about what I did but I was just doing as told and wanted this day to be about my brother and SIL.\n\nso AITA?", "created_utc": 1702436111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18h6rng/aita_for_stopping_an_engagement_before_it_happened/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They'll get over it. Do not message back. Whatever the F other people think, you did your designated job. Also, proposing on someone else 's wedding is just tacky. Way to steal the couple's thunder and use their paid wedding flowers, guests and location to make your proposal look good on social. Sry, but you did a good job.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nProposing at another person's wedding can only be done with explicit permission from the bride and groom. Absent that it is super rude and tacky. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nHonestly who cares what Amy of them think, what did your brother and SIL think? Their opinion is really the only one that matters.\n\nOn top of that it is kind of funnier to me that this is just some coworker and not even a relative, like buddy unless the whole workplace is there you are outnumbered by people who don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care about your proposal at their relative\u2019s wedding.", "NTA and I need to start incorporating \u201cfreakazoid\u201d into my regular vocabulary", "NTA\n\nProposing at someone else's wedding is unbelievably disrespectful.", "Yeah, you\u2019re a great sister, NTA. \n\nYou\u2019ve only heard from people that have heard the story from Alex and it sounds like he probably made it sound more dramatic than it was.", "NTA and \n\n>\u201cyou better not be doing what I think you\u2019re doing, freakazoid\u201d\n\nthis line absolutely destroyed me. You are the wedding hero everyone needs to ensure that the couple gets to celebrate their day without anyone else trying to ride their coat tails. His own gf/fiancee even said she was glad because she doesn't like public proposals and honestly, she probably would have been super embarrassed if he'd gotten to complete the proposal at someone else's wedding.", "**Info** \\- What does SIL think?", "NTA. Good job.", "NTA. It was not their day.", "NTA who thinks that stealing someone else\u2019s thunder is a good idea? I\u2019d be extremely embarrassed  if I was proposed to on others\u2019 big day. It\u2019s about them.", "NTA. You\u2019re a national hero in my book.", "NTA, it's already weird when family members piggyback the location (ambiance, classy clothes) and attention but work friends?!\nDoes your brother know about the whole situation? Being harassed online on top of that by grown people is so wrong. You did good standing up and speaking up!", "NTA\n\nIn my personal opinion, it's incredibly rude for anyone to propose at someone else's wedding, unless the people getting married and the one proposing already agreed on it beforehand. From the sound of it, you were protecting your brother and SIL's special day because others decided they wanted the attention instead.", "NTA. \n\nTrying to hijack someone else's wedding day for your proposal is unbelievably tacky and rude. This shit deserves to be nipped in the bud whenever it crops up (unless specifically and explicitly condoned by the bride and groom), and you did a fine job of it. \n\nTaking the high road means not responding to Alex's friends, but I personally am petty and might respond with something about how you saved Alex from looking crass and cheap by proposing at someone else's wedding, *which everyone knows you shouldn't do.* (And if you want backup on that, just google \"proposing at a wedding\" and pick any one of the thousands of articles that crop up saying \"Holy shit, don't do this.\") \n\nYou did good. I don't know why a certain kind of bonehead keeps thinking \"someone else paid for this party, so I'm gonna make it my time to shine!\" but responses like yours get the correct message across.", "This should become a new wedding role: Anti-Proposal Guard\n\nThey have the sacred duty of preventing heinous attention-seeking proposals.", "NTA - you were a teeeeny bit aggressive but, I get it.

Anything which detracts attention from the groom and bride at their own wedding, unless they agreed to it, is rude. Don't let them bully you into thinking you were wrong. I wish I had a sister like you to interrupt BS like that!", "NTA and it\u2019s hilarious you called him Freakazoid", "NTA. It\u2019s amazing they\u2019re still not embarrassed after getting busted and then double down by trying to use a diagnosis (whether or not it is a diagnosis you possess) as a pejorative.

You were an unsung hero.  In fact, you probably saved the work place friendship between your family and that freakazoid.  If the proposal had been successful and stole the wedding\u2019s thunder, there\u2019s no way your brother and SIL would have forgiven him", "**Absolutely 100% NTA.**\nIf Alex had wanted to propose at your family\u2019s wedding, he should have asked the bride and groom. Manners dictate such courtesy be given as an engagement overshadows the primary event.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a spur of the moment decision, he planned it and deserved to be called names for being such a selfish AH.  \n\nGood job!!", "NTA and a hero \ud83d\ude0a", "Somewhere between NTA and maybe could have been handled better. You were right to stop the proposal. Not sure how loud and public you were about it. If you went in with guns ablazing, could have been handled better. If you were as circumspect as you could be then good job. \n\nHe on the other hand definitely the AH. Not only for the act but also using autistic child as an insult. Definitely an AH move.", "NTA and if their blatant ableism didn\u2019t tip it off it is the fact that you knew that your SIL didn\u2019t like proposals at weddings and you protected her. That is clear NTA behavior", "ESH but you take the three tier cake. Seems like you deputized yourself as the proposal police. You grabbed the man\u2019s collar and called him a freakazoid. Man shouldn\u2019t have taken the knee, but you were out of line how you handled it.", "Op I hope it will be a relief that You are not the only asshole here.  \nYou both are in the wrong. \nWhat he did was definitely rude . No doubt about it . \nBut what you did is definitely not worth being proud of.  \nI hope you understand.\n Nevertheless nothing can be done about it now. So don't dwell on it .", "Soft ESH leanings towards NTA. Its not your place to stop your work friend from proposing, even if its an inappropriate time and your work friend is also an asshole for not just thinking it\u2019s okay to propose at someone else\u2019s wedding but also then weaponising your actions against you. I understand why you stopped him but I think it would\u2019ve been much more sensible for you to talk to him well before this all happened or to just let him propose and let him deal with that idiotic decision because I find it extremely difficult to believe that the rest of the wedding party would\u2019ve been okay with it.\n\nEdited to change brother to friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
