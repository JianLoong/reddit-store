Some background info, my brother and SIL have been dating on/off since they were 13/12 (they broke up in HS and got back together when they ended up working at the same company, different departments) and I\u2019m very close to both of them, they have often cooked for me, done movie nights with me etc. \n\nI\u2019d previously had discussions with my other sisters and SIL about how awful proposals at other peoples weddings are and even joked when I was chosen as a bridesmaid how I was the \u201canti-proposal guard\u201d.\n\nA work friend of my bro and SIL, we\u2019ll call him Alex and his GF Sophia had been together for a few years and were invited to the wedding. Later in the reception, I noticed him quietly talking to another guest and showed him a ring, to which if I hadn\u2019t joked about being \u201canti-proposal guard\u201d I wouldnt have paid much attention to it. About 10 mins later, sure enough he starts talking to his girlfriend and goes to kneel.\n\nThis is when I may be the AH; seeing this, I swoop in and grab his collar and say \u201cyou better not be doing what I think you\u2019re doing, freakazoid\u201d and he quickly stands up, to which I say something along the lines of \u201cthis is really rude to my family and I\u2019m happy for you but i\u2019d appreciate if you didn\u2019t do this here\u201d. He called me an AH but nothing else happened.\n\nTwo days later they got engaged and apparently told people the story because friends of Alex (I assume) started messaging me on instagram saying that what I did was rude and it wasn\u2019t my place, Alex particularly said I ruined the surprise and made a comment about me being a \u2018foolish autistic child\u2019. Sophia however said she was glad because she hated public proposal but said I was patronising to her fianc\u00e9. \n\nI feel a little awful about what I did but I was just doing as told and wanted this day to be about my brother and SIL.\n\nso AITA?\n\nedit for INFO:\nI was diagnosed autistic at 11, my brother didn\u2019t tell him this, I had made a post last year about my diagnosis. \n\n\u2018Freakazoid\u2019 was the actual word I used.\n\nThe joke about me being the Anti-Proposal Guard was because what I lack in conversational skills, I make up for in observational skills.
