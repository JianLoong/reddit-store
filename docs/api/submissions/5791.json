So I suffer with bipolar disorder and my husband is a recovered alcoholic. We got together  when we were at our complete lowest, I was going through my first manic episode and he was in the depth of his addiction. We were a mess but multiple rehab and psych ward visits we are now 35 and he is 10 years sober and I am medicated and stable. \n\nSo although we\u2019re both in a very good place in our lives we do have a 0 alcohol in the home for obvious reasons. My meds under no circumstances can not mix with alcohol and my husband obviously can\u2019t drink it so we prefer to keep it away from our home to prevent the risk of him relapsing. This being said we obviously don\u2019t care if people around us drink or if we go to events with alcohol it\u2019s just not in our home. \n\nNow for Christmas my parents usually host but for the past 3 years one of my siblings has hosted instead (there are 5 of us). This year I was asked to host and was fully up for this. We have a beautiful home and can afford to cater to everyone. Now I did say from the get go that I don\u2019t mind hosting but there can not be any alcohol in my home and if this was going to be a problem then we should just do it else where as I don\u2019t want to risk anything. This may be dramatic but when you live with a recovered addict you have to be as cautious as possible. No one said anything and I assumed everything was fine and that they were all okay with the no alcohol rule.\n\nWhen Friday rolled around my sister called me asking if it was okay if she brought a bottle of Prosecco for her and her husband and that she knows I\u2019m strict about the no alcohol rule but it would just be for her and her husband. I told her no and we ended up getting into a huge fight. I told her that if she wanted alcohol then we could host at her place but by no circumstances was there being alcohol brought under my roof. She said I was being dramatic. \n\nAfter speaking to my mom she said it was too last minute to change arrangements and is one day of alcohol really going to affect much. I personally feel like my sister brought it up so last minute to try and force me in a corner but I just said that if they want alcohol they\u2019re not coming into my home with it.\n\nThey ended up not coming for Christmas and held it at my sisters without inviting us. I had a lovely quiet Christmas with my husband but now none of my siblings, parents and grandparents will speak to me. I felt as though I didn\u2019t do anything wrong but I\u2019m starting to think maybe I should\u2019ve offered to pay to eat out or something instead so everyone could have a drink? \n\nAlso before anyone asks my husband was also against any alcohol in the home and called my sister himself to explain why it\u2019s so important to us and mine and my husbands well-being is my personal top priority in the situation.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1672171026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwogn9/aita_for_refusing_to_have_alcohol_at_my_home_when/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

None of this is your fault.", "No, nope, not at all, NTA.  100%.  Had you not mentioned beforehand that it was a no-alcohol house, that would\u2019ve been maybe slightly inconsiderate, esp if family tradition includes drinking.

It\u2019s your house, your rules. \n\nOnce your sister asked and you said no, that should have be the end of it. Her continuing to push and fight over this, given both of your histories, is wild AH behavior. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like your sister knew about your rule and deliberately picked a fight with you to invoke this outcome.\n\n> After speaking to my mom she said it was too last minute to change arrangements and is one day of alcohol going to affect much\n\nHow is your sister *not bringing a bottle of Prosecco over* too last minute? Just leave it at home? Your mom is also an AH for being an enabler to your sister. \n\n> They ended up coming for Christmas and held it at my sisters without invited us. I had a lovely quiet Christmas with my husband but now none of my siblings, parents and grandparents will speak to me. \n\nThat tells you all you need to know about their character. They couldn\u2019t respect one house rule without being dramatic, in the house of a recovering alcoholic and someone who is on medication. I\u2019d honestly go low to no-contact with them. They aren\u2019t your support system.", "NTA. It's your house. If they don't like it, let them host their own celebration.", "NTA : recovery is a long road and easily slipped. Sorry your sister has a drinking problem and can\u2019t go one night. \nIt is OK to stay away from people who are toxic. Even if they are your family if they cannot respect your wishes that\u2019s not OK and that\u2019s not love and it is not in any way shape or form support for your mental and physical health.", "NTA - First, congrats to you and your husband and how far you\u2019ve both come. Y\u2019all are so blessed to have found each other!\n\nAnd seconds you are in no way an AH! It\u2019s your home and you\u2019re allowed to have rules in your home that make you and your husband feel safe. You shouldn\u2019t be forced to compromise that. You were very upfront about your rules and made it clear that if it was an issue, the gathering could be hosted elsewhere. This was absolutely a problem of *their* own making and they wanted to bully you into a corner so you\u2019d drop your boundaries.\n\nThe fact that they abandoned you over this is appalling. I\u2019m glad you and your husband were still able to have a nice quiet Christmas together, it was probably more drama-free that way. Don\u2019t sweat the rest of the family giving you the silent treatment over this, they are behaving childishly.", "NTA\n\nYou need to set some major boundaries with your family.  They all just showed how little they care about you and your husband.  I am a social drinker and I will never understand how people cannot go without a drink or can't seem to celebrate without a drink!!  It sounds like there are many more alcoholics in your family if they can't give it up for 1 day.", "NTA.\n\nFirstly, your house, your rules.\n\nSecondly, you told them all beforehand that you wouldn't allow alcohol in your house, if they had a problem with it, they should've said so at that time, not waited until the last minute.", "NTA and your family sucks. The fact they changed venues and didn't invite you is just horrific. a bottle of california champagne mattered that much to them.. just wow.", "First of all, congratulations on your journey. That\u2019s a very big thing to be proud of when you have successfully recovered from an addiction of any sort. You\u2019re also a great spouse for supporting your husband through this and watching out for him to avoid situations where he may be tempted to relapse.\n\nDo not feel bad at all for standing up to your family. If they can\u2019t respect your wishes and can\u2019t be empathetic to the reason why you won\u2019t allow it in your home, they don\u2019t deserve to be there. This is *your* safe place. This is your home. Anyone who tells you otherwise is an asshole.\n\nNTA.", "NTA you have them ample warning that alcohol would not be permitted in the house, and if that was a dealbreaker someone else should probably host. It\u2019s not the biggest deal to go a single night without drinking. It\u2019s like asking a Hindu to host thanksgiving and then being pissed there\u2019s no roast beef. What did you think was gonna happen??? \n\nAlso as someone who can\u2019t drink for health reasons and has seen alcohol negatively affect people I care about, I gotta say it\u2019s messed up how much of a grip alcohol has on our modern society. people can\u2019t even have a fun get together without alcohol. I\u2019m not religious but maybe the Mormons and Muslims are onto something.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nYou have clearly enough reason to not have alcohol available in your house, even if none of that was the case it should not be expected of people to ensure it is in the house. Lots of people don\u2019t drink alcohol for a myriad of reasons (myself being one of them), I don\u2019t have alcohol in my house since I don\u2019t drink it. If people want it, they bring it themselves - I think this should just be the case in society anyway.", "NTA. I saw a similar post like this where everyone insisted the OP was some stick in the mud for enforcing a no alcohol rule, but I think that's ridiculous if you can't go one family get-together without a drink. And your husband is a recovered alcoholic! Absolutely not, there is no need to bring that around him. It's just cruel.\n\nYour family is petty if they won't speak to you over asking them to skip the drinks for one day (or at least to go drink after the dinner at your house, just not then). Especially because you even said your sister could host if they wanted alcohol that bad. You quite literally warned them when it was first decided that it would be held at your house, and either no one cared or believed that you would follow through with that. It's not your fault.", "\u201cShe said I was being dramatic.\"\n\" and is one day of alcohol really going to affect much\"\n\nIt's concerning when people can't handle a day without alcohol.\nTalking about drama, they reorganised the dinner and uninvited you are you're the one being dramatic...\n\nAlso this issue with alcohol is very accepted in society. If you say no tobacco in my house are people going to make a big deal about it?\nBut alcohol is a much more socialy accepted *drug* in many parts of the world.", "Nta. Your husband works hard everyday to stay sober and if they can't go one meal without alcohol then maybe they have a problem, his house is his safe spot and for all you know seeing the stuff in the house might be a trigger for him. I already told my fianc\u00e9 when we get married I don't want alcohol at the wedding (we don't drink) because my dad died from it basically and I don't want to be triggered at wedding and if someone can't go without booze for a bit then I don't need them around me", "NTA. They had a fair warning. Well in advance.", "NTA, but your family sure are jerks. I'm glad you and your husband had a nice quiet Christmas together.

Totally valid.  Some recovered alcoholics don't mind having it in their homes and others do.  Everyone is allowed to set their own boundaries. \n\n2) You were very upfront about your stance and even suggested someone else have it if having a dry Christmas would be an issue for them.\n\n3) Your sister was manipulative and so was your mother. The amazing thing to me is your mother's comment that it was too late to move it to someone else's house. The fact that they did precisely that without inviting you is next level.\n\nNext year host a Dry Christmas Eve party and invite friends, and neighbors.  You can have a good time without alcohol and there are lots of people who would appreciate it.", "NTA\n\nYou were clear and upfront from the get go and have every right to have an alcohol free home (and I don't think that's dramatic, as you put it!). If they are this upset about going one day without alcohol - even a few hours without it - that's on them and not you.", "Absolutely NTA. Everyone knows the rule of your home and accepted it in the beginning. I do think perhaps the plan was to try and get it passed just this one time....which is not ok whatsoever. \n\nThem changing the celebration to your sister's and not inviting you two is a grade A asshole move. If I'm 100% honest they would not get an opportunity to speak to me as I would have immediately blocked them. I'm just so glad you and hubby had a lovely time together!", "**NTA**\n\nI don't understand how your family doesn't understand the reasons for you not wanting any alcohol in your home.  It's pretty clear that it is a major issue for you and your husband and you made that very clear up front.\n\nYour mother commented that one day of alcohol might not really affect much.  But what the hell?  If this is her mindset, then going one day WITHOUT alcohol shouldn't affect much either!!  They seriously overreacted and have now created this rift in your family over alcohol.  \n\nDo you see what booze does to people?  This isn't even about somebody doing something stupid while drunk!  Alcohol is such a poison and your family made a huge deal over this when it should not be a big deal to just go a single day without it to be able to have Christmas at your house. \n\nYou set the ground rules and then people wanted to change this very important rule last minute.  Not cool.", "NTA - they\u2019re exactly right, one day shouldn\u2019t be a big deal \u2026 that being - one day of no alcohol for everyone else. Your house, your rules.

Your family is in the wrong completely.", "> is one day of alcohol really going to affect much. \n\nThe correct response to this is \"is one day of no alcohol really going to affect much?\"\n\nNTA    your family is being ridiculous, and if they can't go without alcohol for 1 day, they have an unhealthy attachment to alcohol.", "NTA. You gave them fair warning. They had their chance to change plans.

You have every right with an addict in the house to set that boundary. Shame on them. You have nothing to apologize for. This is the risk of setting boundaries. Some people won't take it well.

You gave them an out to have someone else host. You were completely upfront. The passive-aggressive sister asking last minute is wrong!

You don\u2019t want alcohol in your home because of addiction and mental illness. This shouldn\u2019t be up for debate. The fact your family refuse to even acknowledge why, and instead choose to berate and isolate you, is really telling that they do not support you and your husband. They are selfish. It doesn\u2019t matter if they feel that you should just be ok with it for one evening, you have been clear that you are not.

Also... is one day without alcohol that bad for your family?\n\nThe risk of alcohol being in the house is so high with zero reward for you or your husband, just potential for misery and pain. \n\nPeople should've spoken up sooner too when you brought up your no alcohol policy.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. I enjoy a cocktail or two on the holidays (at least before this damned hiatal hernia), but when my SIL who usually hosts decided a few years ago that she no longer wanted alcohol in her home, I respected her wishes without argument. It is sad that OP\u2019s family prioritizes alcohol above family.", "Hahahaha! This is very similar to a story from a few weeks ago! I\u2019ll play along and say NTA, but you really should have just declined to host.", "Yeah--if the sister and her husband can't have a single dinner without drinking alcohol, why not? Are they afraid they're going to go into DTs if they can't drink prosecco with their turkey? Because if so, sorry to say, OP's family have bigger problems with alcohol than OP or her husband.", "I\u2019m disgusted that her family seem to refuse to even acknowledge why they don\u2019t want alcohol in their home. It\u2019s not even a secret or new thing, and they still asked them to host and refused to accept that this wouldn\u2019t change.", "I think the \"too last minute\" bit is about who was hosting Christmas. Although it clearly wasn't too last minute as they all went somewhere else instead.", "They did", "Completely agree with hosting a dry party.  Your home, your \"tribe.\"  Sorry that your family are assholes.  Happy New Year anyway!  P.S. I am also a non-drinker and have fallen in love with some of the new craft ginger beers.", "100% this is my suspicion.  It sounds like they didn't understand no alcohol means \"no alcohol\" and were maybe always intending to bring their own (\"You're not buying it yourselves so it's fine!\")", "Happy cake day!", "Love \"Castle Doctrine\"!", "Hey I do see what you mean but at the same time I feel as though our home is our safe space and the one place we can be alcohol free. I do think maybe I can be slightly paranoid but I the thought of alcohol in my home makes me feel uncomfortable that\u2019s all.", "I feel like allowing this would open the door for more issues than it\u2019s worth. \n\nPeople might bring much more alcohol than they can drink and forget it when they leave. It doesn\u2019t seem worth the temptation. Guests could easily go out beforehand and do some pregaming if they need it that much.", "Hey do I fully understand your point and I think it\u2019s just about boundaries for me. It\u2019s just a boundary I\u2019ve set for my home that I\u2019ve put into place. I also think there\u2019s a subconscious fear that it may accidentally be left in the home and may cause impulses. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just paranoia but it\u2019s just how I feel for my home.", "not necessarily.  i never asked anyone to not drink in my presence just because i couldn\u2019t.  life is full of alcohol, learn to live around it or fail in sobriety", "Yea, I was just thinking that. I was NTA on that one and this one too, but I don't understand the changing positions.", "Yeah, I kind of remember that.  I think it all comes down to 1) wording and 2) what the first few votes are.\nAt least this isn't one that came down to gender\ud83d\ude06", "Hahah! Probably cause it\u2019s that time of year when drinkings at its peak lol. I didn\u2019t straight up decline as I do love my family and would\u2019ve enjoyed to host but I did put it out there that if they did want a few drinks then let\u2019s host it else where. Everyone was fine with me hosting and fine with my rules until last minute. But in future I\u2019ll take this advice and just decline.", "Loads of posts like this recently (and having vegan/vegetarian only food for thanksgiving or Christmas). The assholes are the ones who sprung this on people after they'd been agreed as the hosts, often after guests had made travel arrangements.\n\nHere OP was upfront about it before being agreed as host, so it's NTA.", "I think it's a very reasonable stance and there is in fact a huge difference between being prepared to be around alcohol and people using it outside your home vs having alcohol in your home. As you say, your home is your safe space and you deserve to have that space that is free of a substance that is dangerous to you both.", "Honestly I 100% understand this approach.  Your home is a personal space - there's a huge mental difference between seeing someone with a beer at a restaurant and someone bringing that beer into your home (especially when dealing with addiction).  It's a shame your family doesn't seem to understand this :(", "Personally, I don't think it's paranoia at all, as the dangers are all to real.\n\nFor yourself, when you are out of the house, both you and your husband are on guard with yourselves and each other to ensure that you don't drink. However, your house is a mental safe space, you don't have to be on guard against drinking alcohol, because there isn't any.", "I just feel like there was such a easy solution here like \"fine drink it in the driveway by your car.\" If it was that important to her I am sure she would have drank by her car outside your house, and you keep your safe space.  People who like other drugs like weed or coke are totally used to this, no issue.", "No, that's fair \u2014 in the end, your house, your rules.\n\nI do suspect there's a bit of paranoia in here, but then again, since when is alcoholism rational?", "True.  The last one was so high and mighty about not being able to have fun without alcohol, this one is more about precaution.  Still, there were a ton of people who didnt care about the reason, just that there would be no alcohol.  Crazy to see the difference in verdict.", "Will be keeping this in mind for future lol x)", "No, it is not paranoia.  It is a clear-eyed understanding of how alcoholism works. One sip can and often does lead to a complete fall off the wagon.  I had a cousin who was like that--one glass of wine at a family dinner led to him going to the liquor store for several bottles.  It happened more than once.  \n\nOP, you are smart to set that hard boundary.", "If I'm not mistaken, there were 2 (!) dry wedding scandal type posts recently also.  I didn't ring in on those b/c I'm biased:  I get so bored at weddings I do go lookin' for a cocktail\ud83d\ude0b", "There's also a big difference between alcohol in your home and being around alcohol at a restaurant, where there are several points between the impulse to have a drink and actually consuming the drink where you can think better of it and refrain. You have to call over a server, or go up to the bar, order the drink, pay for the drink, wait for the drink...all of these are delays that can help someone giving into a momentary impulse to rein it in. When there is a bottle of alcohol in your home and you have an alcohol problem, it is one step from impulse to execution, and for addicts that is too few steps.", "Paranoia *that a bottle \"may accidentally be left in the home\"*", "Doesn't matter if a bottle is left behind, or if a drink is had during dinner. It all leads to the same place."]}
