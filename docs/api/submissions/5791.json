So I suffer with bipolar disorder and my husband is a recovered alcoholic. We got together  when we were at our complete lowest, I was going through my first manic episode and he was in the depth of his addiction. We were a mess but multiple rehab and psych ward visits we are now 35 and he is 10 years sober and I am medicated and stable. \n\nSo although we\u2019re both in a very good place in our lives we do have a 0 alcohol in the home for obvious reasons. My meds under no circumstances can not mix with alcohol and my husband obviously can\u2019t drink it so we prefer to keep it away from our home to prevent the risk of him relapsing. This being said we obviously don\u2019t care if people around us drink or if we go to events with alcohol it\u2019s just not in our home. \n\nNow for Christmas my parents usually host but for the past 3 years one of my siblings has hosted instead (there are 5 of us). This year I was asked to host and was fully up for this. We have a beautiful home and can afford to cater to everyone. Now I did say from the get go that I don\u2019t mind hosting but there can not be any alcohol in my home and if this was going to be a problem then we should just do it else where as I don\u2019t want to risk anything. This may be dramatic but when you live with a recovered addict you have to be as cautious as possible. No one said anything and I assumed everything was fine and that they were all okay with the no alcohol rule.\n\nWhen Friday rolled around my sister called me asking if it was okay if she brought a bottle of Prosecco for her and her husband and that she knows I\u2019m strict about the no alcohol rule but it would just be for her and her husband. I told her no and we ended up getting into a huge fight. I told her that if she wanted alcohol then we could host at her place but by no circumstances was there being alcohol brought under my roof. She said I was being dramatic. \n\nAfter speaking to my mom she said it was too last minute to change arrangements and is one day of alcohol really going to affect much. I personally feel like my sister brought it up so last minute to try and force me in a corner but I just said that if they want alcohol they\u2019re not coming into my home with it.\n\nThey ended up not coming for Christmas and held it at my sisters without inviting us. I had a lovely quiet Christmas with my husband but now none of my siblings, parents and grandparents will speak to me. I felt as though I didn\u2019t do anything wrong but I\u2019m starting to think maybe I should\u2019ve offered to pay to eat out or something instead so everyone could have a drink? \n\nAlso before anyone asks my husband was also against any alcohol in the home and called my sister himself to explain why it\u2019s so important to us and mine and my husbands well-being is my personal top priority in the situation.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1672171026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwogn9/aita_for_refusing_to_have_alcohol_at_my_home_when/", "score": 1862, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Be strong, you\u2019re 100% in the right.", "NTA. \n\nThere was another question like this a while back and she was ruled the A H but that' because she didn't tell anyone and just tried to spring the no-alcohol rule on folks at the last minute.  \n\nYou were up front about it, you have very legitimate concerns, and your family tried to manipulate you.   None of this is your fault.", "No, nope, not at all, NTA.  100%.  Had you not mentioned beforehand that it was a no-alcohol house, that would\u2019ve been maybe slightly inconsiderate, esp if family tradition includes drinking.

If your sis can't go a single meal without alcohol then SHE has a drinking problem and is projecting that onto you and your hubs.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2018s your home and hence your rules. You have valid reasons \u2014 medical based reasons even \u2014 and they can either respect it or let it be.\n\nYou had your Christmas together and they had theirs. They have no reason to be petty towards you now simply because they couldn\u2019t spend a day without alcohol.", "NTA under any circumstances. It\u2019s your house, your rules. \n\nOnce your sister asked and you said no, that should have be the end of it. Her continuing to push and fight over this, given both of your histories, is wild AH behavior. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like your sister knew about your rule and deliberately picked a fight with you to invoke this outcome.\n\n> After speaking to my mom she said it was too last minute to change arrangements and is one day of alcohol going to affect much\n\nHow is your sister *not bringing a bottle of Prosecco over* too last minute? Just leave it at home? Your mom is also an AH for being an enabler to your sister. \n\n> They ended up coming for Christmas and held it at my sisters without invited us. I had a lovely quiet Christmas with my husband but now none of my siblings, parents and grandparents will speak to me. \n\nThat tells you all you need to know about their character. They couldn\u2019t respect one house rule without being dramatic, in the house of a recovering alcoholic and someone who is on medication. I\u2019d honestly go low to no-contact with them. They aren\u2019t your support system.", "NTA. It's your house. If they don't like it, let them host their own celebration.", "NTA : recovery is a long road and easily slipped. Sorry your sister has a drinking problem and can\u2019t go one night. \nIt is OK to stay away from people who are toxic. Even if they are your family if they cannot respect your wishes that\u2019s not OK and that\u2019s not love and it is not in any way shape or form support for your mental and physical health.", "NTA - First, congrats to you and your husband and how far you\u2019ve both come. Y\u2019all are so blessed to have found each other!\n\nAnd second, you are in no way an AH! It\u2019s your home and you\u2019re allowed to have rules in your home that make you and your husband feel safe. You shouldn\u2019t be forced to compromise that. You were very upfront about your rules and made it clear that if it was an issue, the gathering could be hosted elsewhere. This was absolutely a problem of *their* own making and they wanted to bully you into a corner so you\u2019d drop your boundaries.\n\nThe fact that they abandoned you over this is appalling. I\u2019m glad you and your husband were still able to have a nice quiet Christmas together, it was probably more drama-free that way. Don\u2019t sweat the rest of the family giving you the silent treatment over this, they are behaving childishly.", "NTA\n\nYou need to set some major boundaries with your family.  They all just showed how little they care about you and your husband.  I am a social drinker and I will never understand how people cannot go without a drink or can't seem to celebrate without a drink!!  It sounds like there are many more alcoholics in your family if they can't give it up for 1 day.", "NTA.\n\nFirstly, your house, your rules.\n\nSecondly, you told them all beforehand that you wouldn't allow alcohol in your house, if they had a problem with it, they should've said so at that time, not waited until the last minute.", "NTA and your family sucks. The fact they changed venues and didn't invite you is just horrific. a bottle of california champagne mattered that much to them.. just wow.", "First of all, congratulations on your journey. That\u2019s a very big thing to be proud of when you have successfully recovered from an addiction of any sort. You\u2019re also a great spouse for supporting your husband through this and watching out for him to avoid situations where he may be tempted to relapse.\n\nDo not feel bad at all for standing up to your family. If they can\u2019t respect your wishes and can\u2019t be empathetic to the reason why you won\u2019t allow it in your home, they don\u2019t deserve to be there. This is *your* safe place. This is your home. Anyone who tells you otherwise is an asshole.\n\nNTA.", "NTA you have them ample warning that alcohol would not be permitted in the house, and if that was a dealbreaker someone else should probably host. It\u2019s not the biggest deal to go a single night without drinking. It\u2019s like asking a Hindu to host thanksgiving and then being pissed there\u2019s no roast beef. What did you think was gonna happen??? \n\nAlso as someone who can\u2019t drink for health reasons and has seen alcohol negatively affect people I care about, I gotta say it\u2019s messed up how much of a grip alcohol has on our modern society. people can\u2019t even have a fun get together without alcohol. I\u2019m not religious but maybe the Mormons and Muslims are onto something.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nYou have clearly enough reason to not have alcohol available in your house, even if none of that was the case it should not be expected of people to ensure it is in the house. Lots of people don\u2019t drink alcohol for a myriad of reasons (myself being one of them), I don\u2019t have alcohol in my house since I don\u2019t drink it. If people want it, they bring it themselves - I think this should just be the case in society anyway.", "NTA. I saw a similar post like this where everyone insisted the OP was some stick in the mud for enforcing a no alcohol rule, but I think that's ridiculous if you can't go one family get-together without a drink. And your husband is a recovered alcoholic! Absolutely not, there is no need to bring that around him. It's just cruel.\n\nYour family is petty if they won't speak to you over asking them to skip the drinks for one day (or at least to go drink after the dinner at your house, just not then). Especially because you even said your sister could host if they wanted alcohol that bad. You quite literally warned them when it was first decided that it would be held at your house, and either no one cared or believed that you would follow through with that. It's not your fault.", "\u201cShe said I was being dramatic.\"\n\" and is one day of alcohol really going to affect much\"\n\nIt's concerning when people can't handle a day without alcohol.\nTalking about drama, they reorganised the dinner and uninvited you are you're the one being dramatic...\n\nAlso this issue with alcohol is very accepted in society. If you say no tobacco in my house are people going to make a big deal about it?\nBut alcohol is a much more socialy accepted *drug* in many parts of the world.", "Nta. Your husband works hard everyday to stay sober and if they can't go one meal without alcohol then maybe they have a problem, his house is his safe spot and for all you know seeing the stuff in the house might be a trigger for him. I already told my fianc\u00e9 when we get married I don't want alcohol at the wedding (we don't drink) because my dad died from it basically and I don't want to be triggered at wedding and if someone can't go without booze for a bit then I don't need them around me", "NTA. They had a fair warning. Well in advance.", "NTA, but your family sure are jerks. I'm glad you and your husband had a nice quiet Christmas together. When shitty people give you the gift of their silence, enjoy it while it lasts. They'll be trying to get you to pick up their calls to be berated soon enough.\n\nETA: also, congratulations to your husband on his decade (wow!) of sobriety. :)", "NTA\n\nShe knew it beforehand, called to get permission, and got mad when she didn't get the answer she wanted.\n\nThey couldn't go one day without alcohol? You're not asking them to never drink, you're asking them to not drink in your home. The one place in the world where you get to make the rules.\n\nWhat rule would she not allow in her home and why should it be given anymore respect?", "NTA.  \n\n1)Your husband is a recovered alcoholic and doesn't want it in your home.  Totally valid.  Some recovered alcoholics don't mind having it in their homes and others do.  Everyone is allowed to set their own boundaries. \n\n2) You were very upfront about your stance and even suggested someone else have it if having a dry Christmas would be an issue for them.\n\n3) Your sister was manipulative and so was your mother. The amazing thing to me is your mother's comment that it was too late to move it to someone else's house. The fact that they did precisely that without inviting you is next level.\n\nNext year host a Dry Christmas Eve party and invite friends, and neighbors.  You can have a good time without alcohol and there are lots of people who would appreciate it.", "NTA\n\nYou were clear and upfront from the get go and have every right to have an alcohol free home (and I don't think that's dramatic, as you put it!). If they are this upset about going one day without alcohol - even a few hours without it - that's on them and not you.", "Absolutely NTA. Everyone knows the rule of your home and accepted it in the beginning. I do think perhaps the plan was to try and get it passed just this one time....which is not ok whatsoever. \n\nThem changing the celebration to your sister's and not inviting you two is a grade A asshole move. If I'm 100% honest they would not get an opportunity to speak to me as I would have immediately blocked them. I'm just so glad you and hubby had a lovely time together!", "**NTA**\n\nI don't understand how your family doesn't understand the reasons for you not wanting any alcohol in your home.  It's pretty clear that it is a major issue for you and your husband and you made that very clear up front.\n\nYour mother commented that one day of alcohol might not really affect much.  But what the hell?  If this is her mindset, then going one day WITHOUT alcohol shouldn't affect much either!!  They seriously overreacted and have now created this rift in your family over alcohol.  \n\nDo you see what booze does to people?  This isn't even about somebody doing something stupid while drunk!  Alcohol is such a poison and your family made a huge deal over this when it should not be a big deal to just go a single day without it to be able to have Christmas at your house. \n\nYou set the ground rules and then people wanted to change this very important rule last minute.  Not cool.", "NTA - they\u2019re exactly right, one day shouldn\u2019t be a big deal \u2026 that being - one day of no alcohol for everyone else. Your house, your rules. This is your well being and your partners sobriety. Your family is in the wrong completely.", "> is one day of alcohol really going to affect much. \n\nThe correct response to this is \"is one day of no alcohol really going to affect much?\"\n\nNTA    your family is being ridiculous, and if they can't go without alcohol for 1 day, they have an unhealthy attachment to alcohol.", "NTA. You gave them fair warning. They had their chance to change plans. They tried to put you on the spot to force your hand instead of asking the question much earlier.\n\nHonestly I have to wonder how healthy THEIR relationship with alcohol is if they can\u2019t withstand one afternoon without it.", "NTA Your family is a huge asshole. You have every right with an addict in the house to set that boundary. Shame on them. You have nothing to apologize for. This is the risk of setting boundaries. Some people won't take it well.

They can do one single day without alcohol.", "NTA, as the host, you should have the right to allow or disallow alcohol", "NTA \nYour house your rules.

You gave them an out to have someone else host. You were completely upfront. The passive-aggressive sister asking last minute is wrong! If somebody had a life-threatening allergy in the family, it would be treated in the same manner you are with serious life altering medical issues!

Putting some distance may be healthier for you.", "NTA! \nYour family really have very little regard for your or your husband's wellbeing. I am glad you kept strong and reinforced the rules.

Your family is acting ridiculous for dying on this hill to the point they're shunning you.  It was literally one party where they wouldn't get to drink, which wasn't even a thing because they had it at your sister's instead anyways.  Maybe they have an alcohol problem if drinking is more important to them than respecting family?", "If you truly said it right when you offered to host, then NTA.  It was also a good idea to go out instead on your hosting turn.  Ultimately it sounds like you had a good holiday, and they had the celebration they wanted.", "NTA, because you made the conditions very clear ahead of time and noted you would be happy if to have it somewhere else if that was an issue.

You weren't asked to purchase or keep alcohol, this easily could've been gone by the end of the night, and there isn't a real tangible difference between other people drinking in your home as opposed to the same people drinking around you in their home. \n\nBut you also made the stipulation clear upfront, it's messed up that your family chose a bottle of prosecco over you, and even more messed up that they ended up excluding you from Christmas as a result. It sounds like an immense over-reaction from your family.", "NTA... i get it... but have you checked in with a professional latley to just asses the anxiety? Also.. as much as family drama sucks your family is allowed to feel how they feel. Maybe you need to also look at your family if they cant go ONE day without alcohol.

You don\u2019t want alcohol in your home because of addiction and mental illness. This shouldn\u2019t be up for debate. The fact your family refuse to even acknowledge why, and instead choose to berate and isolate you, is really telling that they do not support you and your husband. They are selfish. It doesn\u2019t matter if they feel that you should just be ok with it for one evening, you have been clear that you are not.

I think that here is the perfect opportunity for you and your husband to start something new for the upcoming year.  Being busy.\n\nYes that means for every celebration, every special day, every holiday for the next year, you and he should make plans on all of those days, you just do not have time to play those stupid games, they can keep the stupid prizes and be busy.  I would bet that both of you have really good friends that would enjoy having a nice holiday meal with you or a meal where all of you can sit, enjoy the meal and good company and never once have to worry about anyone breaking your basic house rule.  \n\nI can also tell you that after you miss a few birthdays and mothers day and a holiday that you and your husband would normally be at, and they found out that you and he are booked, they may wonder why, and when it becomes apparent that you are no longer playing, look out for them to try to guilt trip and manipulate and then finally when they are wanting contact, ask that they apologize for 2 things:  1)  The sheer gall to violate your most basic house rule, and 2)  For the way that they treated you, after, how the silence treatment can and will go both ways.

They put celebrating without you over a bottle of prosecco. That\u2019s problematic.", ">is one day of alcohol really going to affect much\n\nWell is one day without really such a huge deal to them? NTA i don't get why so many people always need alcohol around", "NTA. One bottle of alcohol was worth more to your family than you and your husband. I would reevaluate your exact relationship with them, and question why you wanted them over for Christmas in the first place.", "I am so sorry your family (even the freaking grandparents!?) is treating you this way. I hope you enjoyed your quiet Christmas!! Sometimes they're the best kind! \n\nTotally NTA. And totally AH of them to try to manipulate you into it and/or force your hand!!", "NTA! I\u2019m petty to all hell and my butt would be bombarding my sister and BIL with links to AA meetings, how to tell if you have a drinking problem, show support for their difficult time. Messaging the family you are mad at you that you think that sis and bil have a drinking problem and they are only enabling their disease because they couldn\u2019t go 1 dinner without alcohol!", "NTA.  If they can't skip ONE day, a few hours without alcohol, they're the asshole. How hard is it to follow a simple rule?  Let's say it was a severe peanut allergy - can't even risk smelling them because of peanut dust - they'd be assholes trying to bring in cracker jack.  And if they can't enjoy themselves without a drink they really should stay home.", "If they are asking 'is one day of alcohol really going to affect much?', then why would one day of no alcohol be a problem? \n\nIf alcohol was a completely indispensable part of Christmas they shouldn't have asked you to host and should have taken on board that Christmas at yours would be alcohol-free. They could always have have a couple of drinks at theirs, come to dinner at yours, had non-alcoholic cocktails and then gone back to someone else's house and had Christmas evening drinks. Their behaviour sounds pretty selfish to me. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nYou made the conditions for you hosting clear at the start. They were testing your boundaries and you held firm. Your house, your rules. They had the option to host elsewhere.", "NTA, NTA, NTA! As the child of an alcoholic who just fell off the wagon and Fing ruined Xmas for everyone in the family still talking to him I can absolutely say you are NTA, your sister tried last minute in order to try to pressure you and obviously has no respect for either you, your husband, what you have been through or care for what might happen if things went wrong. She absolutely sucks. Seriously, she can\u2019t have  one Xmas day without a drink for the sake of her sister? If not she needs to take a good long look in the mirror and think about her own drinking habits. \n\nGood on you OP - well some staying strong for you and your partner! X", "NTA, Your family chose a bottle of Proseco over you and were so butthurt about it they didn't invite you to Christmas. You do not need those people in your life.", "NTA. The same way they said \" what difference would one day make ?\" , Could have been applied to themselves .\n\n\nYour husband and your health are definitely paramount. \n\nFrom what i understand, you never made it an issue when it was hosted at their house   would be mental, trying to impose your rules on someone else's house, amirite?\n\n\n if they can't understand and have no empathy for your husband, they aren't the people you need around you, anyway", "There's definitely an AH in this story, but it's not you. You laid out the rules, everybody agreed, and then they an to bring alcohol? After you've laid out your reasons why? \n\nNTA, hun. But your family definitely is. \n\n\"Is one day of alcohol really a problem\" - seriously? If your sister can't go a day without alcohol, your husband much want to give her the number for his sponsor.", "NTA - if she could host last minute, then she could have respected your boundaries and still invite you.", "I don't drink currently. I don't even remember when I have drunk alcohol, maybe before covid? So I can live without alcohol for long times. \n\nWhat annoys me is that other people tell me if I can or cannot drink. I hate that I have to accommodate for people who have issues with alcohol. First people are suffering when alcoholic drinks (I have lived with alcoholics) and when they get sober, we should avoid alcohol because they can't drink. It is so damn annoying to live in their terms whether they drink or not. The main thing is alcoholics feelings and needs and that is so infuriating sometimes. So it is not that family couldn't live without alcohol, why shouldn't they have drink in Christmas if they want to? \n\nI also understand why they are not in contact, in their eyes Christmas was ruined since OP and husband made their issues whole family's issue. If they have been ok to see other people drinking past years at Christmas dinner or other events, why this time would be different? It's not like they were planning to get hammered.", "Absolutely NTA \n\nI like a drink, and I like a drink at Christmas. Not being able to have a glass would affect the day for me, and I would rather have it in a different location if alcohol wasn\u2019t permitted somewhere.\n\nI would absolutely never ask for an exception and try to bring alcohol to a recovering alcoholics house. That is so abhorrently disrespectful I\u2019m shocked the rest of the family are in agreement. Your and your husbands well being are far and away more important than slightly hampering the family\u2019s enjoyment of the day. Hosting somewhere else would have been the obvious move, and if sister doesn\u2019t want to host, suck it up with respect and have a drink on Christmas Eve and Boxing Day. \n\nYou were clear about the terms of having it at your house, and they agreed. Had they raised the issue initially, there would have been plenty of time to make alternative plans. It\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t anticipate they\u2019d want wine with Christmas dinner.\n\nWell done you for sticking to your guns and protecting your households well-being, I\u2019m so sorry your family are being so shitty to you but you are most certainly NTA.", "Yeah I found the alcohol thing weird too. Like initially I thought ok there\u2019s a danger if they buy alcohol and it goes unfinished now there\u2019s a serious chance of relapse or something. But if the guest brings it and takes it with them then how is that different than you being at their house and they\u2019re drinking, which you\u2019re fine with? Seems weird", "Or was it? If OP and husband have been able to attend events where other people drink, for example Christmas dinner at other relative's home, they could have honestly think that it is not a big deal if they have wine with same people in same occasion. Only the location was different. Which is not logical in their mind.", "Less alcoholic and more entitled AH IMO.  I'm someone who drinks pretty liberally - 1-2 nights a week and a bingey day/night out once every other month or so.\n\nIf someone says an event is dry, I comply.  My wife's sister is a recovering alcoholic who did 8 years sober but fell off the wagon hard recently - I had no problem hosting a booze-free Easter last year to be mindful of that.\n\nI don't think this was even about the booze in this case - it was about purposefully pushing OP's limits.", "I can't imagine this whole thing is just about alcohol or forcing alcohol into OPs home. There would have been other solutions. The thing that stands out to me is the fact, that OP got cut out of the festivities completely. And because of that it reads to me more like the sister wanting to exclude OP even before she made a fuss about alcohol. And the way she did it, she got an excuse.", "Smokers smell bad and make the things they interact with often smell bad, so it\u2019s very noticeable. It also can\u2019t be done indoors without ruining the house. Alcohol is much easier to have without lasting effects, and even when it does have lasting effects they aren\u2019t always as blatant.", "I don't drink alcohol, but I really like coke (the drink). If I couldn't drink coke ever again for whatever reason that would bother me, but not longer than a day or so. I think if the thought of never being able to drink alcohol anymore bothers you a lot more than this you should seriously rethink your alcohol consumption.", "How shitty is your family that you can\u2019t tolerate them for one dinner without alcohol?", "They said that they are ok when other people drink in other events. They had been in events including Christmas dinner where people were having drinks. They might sincerely thought that them having couple glasses wine is not a big deal, but somehow it was. If it is same people, same holiday why it matters what location it is that they can or cannot drink. It is not like they force them to drink, or planned to get hammered. \n\nThey did honor their wish and had their dinner and drinks elsewhere. I would not have invited them either since it is clear that they don't want to be near alcohol.", "Eh, they're fine, I think. I wouldn't know, I travelled home for Christmas just 1 out of the last 10 years. I'm not that into it.", "This is a joke, right?", "They are entitled alcoholics. You don\u2019t need to drown in booze to be alcoholic. You can sip the finest wine there is, but if you can\u2019t imagine celebrating without any, you have a problem.", "I'm also guilty of drinking too much and too often, but spent Christmas day with my family sobar, as I was driving home after. \n\nOPs family don't seem to respect her or her husband", "NTA \n\nYou made the rule clear, and nobody said anything. \n\nThey're all complete A H for not respecting your and your husband's boundaries. You made it clear, and they started challenging you, and got angry when you stuck to your boundaries.\n\nControllers and manipulators hate boundaries, and the entire situation just shows how petty they were when they couldn't control you.", "NTA, not even slightly. You were clear and consistent with your rule, and alerted everyone early on. As you suggest in your post, she definitely left that question to the last minute to force you to comply. Then the family decided they would prefer the presence of alcohol to the presence of you and your sober husband.\n\nThey couldn't go one single event without alcohol. As others have pointed out, that kind of decision making implies that they have their own issues with alcohol. Had you allowed them into your home with that bottle of Prosecco, others would have turned up with alcohol they \"just happened\" to pick up once they heard of the rule change. Then they would have been sharing it with each other. Then they would have told your husband to have just one sip, it won't hurt. One glass. Finish off the bottle.\n\nYou absolutely made the right call, and their response only reinforces how right you were in making that call. You may have saved your husband from relapse by standing your ground on this, so do not question whether this was the right choice - it was.\n\nCongratulations to your husband on his continued sobriety!", "NTA\n\nThey knew about not bringing alcohol and why - but your sister decided her desire to have a drink could overrule the medical needs of you and your husband. She is a real AH - and so are the rest of your family for supporting her.\n\nMy parents never had alcohol in their house for religious reasons - but they had marvellous Christmas celebrations.  Ultimately, it doesn't really matter whether guests understand or agree with your no alcohol rule - they just have to follow your rules in your house. \n\nIn my estimation, if someone can't go without alcohol for a day, to the extent that they switch locations for Christmas and blank a family member over it, then they have a problem with alcohol.", "NTA. Anyone who refuses to abide by the rules of your home isn't good for you. Anyone who would deliberately bring alcohol to a recovering alcoholic's home is selfish and isn't good for you.", "Personally, I believe that as an addict you're not really recovered if simply seeing your substance of choice is enough to cause a relapse. I'm a recovered cocaine addict, and in my own mind, I was still an addict if I saw cocaine and couldn't resist. I understand it's somewhat of a controversial opinion regarding addiction recovery, but I hadn't seen it posted anywhere in the thread yet and I thought that maybe it warranted some consideration.\n\nThat being said, this is your home. What you will or will not allow in your own home supersedes opinions regarding addiction. Quite simply - your house, your rules. No further discussion required.\n\nSo NTA, because it's entirely your decision what you have in your home, and you're right in telling them that if they don't like it, then they can arrange for other options by themselves.", "NTA. If they need the alcohol so bad then they have a problem\u2026.and can host in their home.  They also tried to sabotage you into allowing alcohol\u2026.not good and glad you stuck to your rules.", "NTA. \n\nMedical & addiction situation aside, the entire situation is shitty. Your boundaries were not respected, full stop. You gave full disclosure well in advance and offered options to avoid problems. Your relatives insisted on creating problems.", "I didn't read any of that post past \"my husband is a recovering alcoholic\"\n\nNTA", "NTA - but your whole family is", "Agree with them. One day of alcohol really won\u2019t affect anything, so they should absolutely be able to do without it. \n\nNTA.", "**NTA**\n\nYou gave them the condition before hand. \n\nAs they\u2019re your immediate family they must be aware of the past & health conditions you two go through. \n\nIt\u2019s just very insensitive of them to do so and anyway I don\u2019t understand the hype around that bitter-tongue-gone-bad drink.", "Why isn't it an issue when they go to events where people drink alcohol? If they have been in family events where people have had alcohol, why suddenly it is not ok same people to drink when dinner is at their place?", "I think it\u2019s about someone\u2019s safe space/haven.\n\n1) when you go out somewhere you can prepare yourself for what you\u2019ll see and be around. You can also leave when it gets to be too much for you. If it\u2019s at your house and it gets to be too much, you can\u2019t leave. You have some element of control that way. You also are sitting in your seat in the ballpark, not in front of the beer stand, and sure a beer vendor might walk around a few times a game, but that\u2019s a few moments of strength instead of a constant.\n\n2) because you\u2019re at home your guard is probably going to be down, or lower than it would be purpose your home. You have a natural tendency to relax at home, in a controlled environment, which could be dangerous with alcohol present. And as a host you could be asked to handle it, like putting it in a fridge or pouring, and you wouldn\u2019t at someone else\u2019s house.", "Don't doubt yourself.  It's your home, your safe place, and you were clear up front about your rules.  You are completely right in everything you did.  My husband and I have both endured abuse from alcoholics and very, very rarely drink ourselves.  We'd never consider allowing guests to bring alcohol into our home and we wouldn't feel a bit bad about it.  Frankly, it sounds like your family has problems they need to address if they can't spend one evening without drinking.", "If OP and husband have been in events seeing family members drink before and now suddenly alcohol is big no, I would make assumption that they don't want to join events where people drink anymore.\n\nOP told that they don't mind people drinking and only difference is that dinner was at their house. So if there wasn't issue to have couple glasses of prosecco last year at dinner sister or parent was hosting, why it is so big deal now?", "Judging by the family's actions, I think I might need a stiff drink or a good hit of THC before going to deal with them.\n\nThere's a reason I take my bad pen to family gatherings... A quick sneak out back, and I can tolerate them just a little longer-", "Yep. Alcoholics would just have pre-partied and/or kept a bar in the trunk to pop out to once or twice. (I come from a family of alcoholics). \nOPs family left her out of Christmas because they want the ambiance of social drinking and she dared ask for a disability accommodation in her own home.", "Yup - my SIL who I mentioned previously would disappear into the bathroom hourly while everyone else was politely enjoying themselves - she was uncomfortably drunk for the rest of us by dinner time.  Safe to assume she had a supply that she smuggled in plus whatever she had drank beforehand.", "NTA.\n\nJust throw the whole family away.", "Your family are huge AH\u2019s!!!", "Honestly I fully agree with you but I've read that post and I think it's less she was a buzz kill and more she was a very condescending and insulting to everyone about it like she kept calling people who drink alcohol at parties immature children and literally said in the post \"it's time for everyone to grow up and have a mature party.\"\n\nThis is why OP definitely NTA she was not rude about it she very politely asked everyone to not bring alcohol to her house and she didn't act like she was on a high horse while doing so.", "And then don't forget to quietly call the cops to have them checked for DUI after."]}
