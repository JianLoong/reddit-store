You didn\u2019t tell her your friends were coming over so it was an ambush. \n\nHowever, for me this would be a deal breaker (the fact she doesn\u2019t want to meet your friends and is unwilling to socialize with them in any capacity). It\u2019s been a year. Shit. You need to decide for yourself if you are compatible long term.", "For this particular situation, YTA. You forced her into something that she didn't want and wasn't ready for. General consensus to me seems like yall aren't compatible. You enjoy socializing, she doesn't. It would be fine if yall were happy and could make it work. But don't force that shizz. Put yourself in other's shoes before you just decide to do things.", "I don't understand people who think completely ignoring someone's boundaries is okay.  And then act all surprised that the person gets upset.  Like what were you expecting? YTA", "YTA. Your girlfriend was up front about not wanting to meet your friends. She set a boundary and instead of trying to convince her compromise or exploring the underlying reasons behind her decision, you tricked her into doing something she does not want to do. \n\nIf her not being willing to hang around your friends is a dealbreaker for you, you can leave her. If you want to try to come to a compromise, you can ask if she is willing.

You literally ambushed her and forced her into a situation she didn't want to be in without even trying to communicate with her.\n\n>She just doesn\u2019t want to socialize. Isn\u2019t that childish ?\n\nNo, it's not childish. Some people naturally do not like socializing, and that's fine. \n\n\n>She can\u2019t even tough it out 1h?\n\nMaybe she could have, if you had even bothered asking her if she could try meeting them for one hour.

If it\u2019s important that your SO embrace your friends, you may need to look elsewhere.", "YTA.  You blindsided her knowing she is introverted and would be uncomfortable.  \n\nIt\u2019s fine to explain your feelings and try to compromise but you can\u2019t just force it upon her.

It sounds like she has severe social anxiety-she stayed \u201cbottled up\u201d the entire time, so her frustration with being forced to socialize (ambushed) came out in a harsh, poorly directed way.", "YTA. I understand your feelings about wanting her to meet your friends, but you did this in the absolute worst way possible. \n\nWhen differences arise with a partner, *you talk to them about it.* If they\u2019re firm on their stance and you can\u2019t live with it, *you go your separate ways*.\n\nYou don\u2019t trick someone into doing something you are well aware they are against.

Dude, she's an introvert, and struggles to make small talk.   You ambushed her with something YOU consider fun but SHE considers torture.   And all because you want to show her off?  Stop it.   She's a human being, not a toy for you to show off to your buddies.", "YTA Because maybe she has social anxiety. Maybe she\u2019s neurodivergent and doing the small talk thing is hella stressful. Maybe she just doesn\u2019t want to be around people she didn\u2019t intentionally choose to be around. There\u2019s a reason for this wether she shared what that is with you or not. She\u2019s a grown woman with a clear boundary that you chose to ingnore and trample because she doesn\u2019t exist the same way as you. The thing to do would have been to have a conversation with her and ask her to meet young friends if for nothing else but to put faces to names. There were so many different ways to approach this and you picked the exact wrong one,", "YTA. She set up a boundary which you didn't respect. If she lets you do your own thing not isolating you to her lifestyle, what's the issue?", "You\u2019re a childish A. All to impress your friends?", "Omg totally TA, I'd be horrified if I were her!!! One thing is if you had asked her FIRST, not all of us want to be exposed and forced to interact with people just like that, not without warning and time to prepare! This may be cos I am ASD but I'd be beyond upset if this happened to me, what is it childish is forcing people to do things, jesus", "YTA - what \u201ccompromises\u201d are you having to make?

You gotta respect that or get out of dodge. Im the same. I don't socialize with anyone. I've had two visits by the same person the past year, its been bliss. I don't wanna hang out with people, I don't wanna go to functions. Thats my choice, Im an adult I get to decide how I like to live. Its not on you to force your opinion on that on me. You sign up to be with a person - you accept who they are - if you can't - then thats your issue.\n\nSome of us just prefer our own company for various reasons. Its not weird or anything - we're just secure enough that we don't need a constant buzz of people around to feel validated. \n\nYou do you.

You pushed her boundaries by the extreme. YTA. By far.", "YTA You can't just trick someone into doing something they've clearly stated they're not ok with. \n\nThat said, if it were me I would not date someone with no friends, or someone who refused to meet my friends, or someone who just placed so little value on friendship.\n\nBut those are not contradictory. You get to control what you do (who you date) not what other people do (who she's willing to meet).", "YTA. Am using someone is manipulation. You could have had an adult conversation and dug into how and why and where you both can compromise. Instead you chose to ambush her an disrespect her boundaries.", "100% YTA,\n\n\nWhy would you force her to do something she doesn't want to do? If she is happy the way things are leave her be.", "YTA. You ambushed her, first of all. Second of all, although relationships are about compromise, this is obviously not an issue she is interested in compromising on. Figure out if you can deal with it.  If not, move on.", "I have bad social anxiety and that used to be one of my excuses I used when I'm too embarassed to say its social anxiety. These days I'm comfortable to just be honest and open about it.

If she wants to make friends at some point she will, it's her choice. \n\nI'm the same. I'm an introvert and if I'm by myself, I just do my own thing.

That is not cool, mate. For me, it's totally YOUR doing that she reacts so harshly. She felt betrayed because you basically lied to her and them ambush her with your friends knowing that she never wants to meet them.\n\nBUT.\n\nI can totally say this, you guys are not compatible. You want a more sociable person whom you can introduce to your friends and have her socialize. She is NOT that person.\n\nIf you've asked her in the past, to bear an hour of socializing for your sake and she refused, then that's it, that's who she really is.

She didn't blow up and leave right away.\n\nIf you want her to interact with your friends that's something you have to discuss with her and if she says no then you have to decide if the relationship can work.\n\nIf she is autistic then the anxiety about small talk, enjoying being alone and the very negative reaction to a surprise all make sense. Of course she might just be introverted or have social anxiety, but regardless you need to respect her boundaries and learn to communicate.", "ESH.

Nobody forces her, nobody judges her and everyone respects this in my family. She put up a boundary and we wouldn\u2019t dream of even tempting crossing it no matter how much we miss her or want her around.

Describing the whole thing as \u201cforcing her to small talk to people I don\u2019t care about\u201d comes off as aloof and egotistical, and shows she has little to no regard for the relationships that you have.  Personally if I introduced my significant other to my friends and they said that, it would be a deal breaker.  \n\nBlindsiding her with a meet up probably wasn\u2019t the best way to go about it, but her reaction is over the top and dismissive.  It\u2019s one thing to be asocial, it\u2019s another thing to freak out cuz you had to meet 3 people.  Some people are fine alone and that\u2019s cool, but if that loner also wants a romantic partner they you gotta make some compromises.  Sounds like you 2 can\u2019t communicate well with each other and express your needs, wants, and motivations to each other in a way that\u2019s mutually beneficial and understood by both of you.  She showed you her true colors, she\u2019s cold as ice, and she\u2019ll ice you out in a heartbeat if there ever comes a day you fall into that category of \u201cpeople I don\u2019t care about\u201d.  There\u2019s probably some serious social anxiety at play here, but I don\u2019t think that excuses how she spoke about your friends.", "ESH. You for putting your girlfriend in that situation when she didn't want to be, and your girlfriend for insulting your friends, when they did nothing wrong.", "ESH but fuck me what a frustrating way for her to behave", "NTA. No matter how introverted one is, her reaction is a bit over the top. In a healthy relationship, in normal circumstances, your friend groups are cordially mutually accepted.", "ESH.\n\nYou probably shouldn't have sprung your friend on her.\n\nHowever, unless she has unmanaged social anxiety and mental health issues, your girlfriend is kind of an arsehole. Tell her to get help or break it off.", "NTA\n\nBut why do you date someone who has such little respect for you?", "ESH.\n\nIf she has any degree of social anxiety, which I suspect she does if she went entirely mute once they showed up, then what you did was horrible and stressful.\n\nBut, and I say this as someone who also goes mute as soon as I'm around people I don't consider friends (and even when I do- how unsurprising ive never dated either), it's not reasonable of her to not meet your friends even once or tolerate their company now and then. It's fine if she chooses not to have friends, but so long as she chooses to date someone, she has to deal with the fact that they come with people.", "I'm an introvert, but always make an effort to catch up with my husband's friends. They're my friends now too.

You in this specific situation, but your girlfriend sounds like a misantropist in general or maybe she has very bad social anxiety? Anyway, what she did was also rude.", "Nah fuck that. This isn\u2019t an ambush. You asked her to come over. Friends. Called up and you said sure, come over my gf is gonna be here. How is that an ambush? \n\nI\u2019d add she\u2019s the asshole for what she said about \u201csmall talk\u201d. Fuck everything about that. Back to her hole. She sounds miserable.

She declines any invitation she gets. She always wants to be at home or do her activities alone or with me . ( her place is awesome btw, she\u2019s always building something). We\u2019ve been together for 1 year. \n\nI have to say, she lets me do my thing, she doesn\u2019t care that I go out with friends . The thing is that she never wanted to meet my friends. Like I had 2 birthdays this year. It sucks because she\u2019s very bubbly and talented, I wish they knew that. \n\nSaturday, she came over and I ask my friends (3) to come over too.  When they came, she was respectful, but then she acted mute. Maybe 30 minutes later, she leaves through the back door. I called her and she said \" are you happy now? Forcing me to do small talk to people I don\u2019t care about ? \"\n\nThey are my closest friends. I\u2019m mad about what she said.  She just doesn\u2019t want to socialize. Isn\u2019t that childish  ? Why am I the only one making compromises? She can\u2019t even tough it out 1h? AITA?\nWe haven\u2019t talked since\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Your friendships are important to you and her inability to compromise on that is turning you off. Ambushing her was not cool. But I think this is very telling of what she\u2019s like and you are not on the same page.", "YTA. Yes, her reaction was a little childish, \u201cpeople I don\u2019t care about,\u201d and she shouldn\u2019t have stooped to your level (because ambushing her is also incredibly childish!!) I would have left too, if I have to interact with people I don\u2019t know I need time to mentally prepare. You can\u2019t just spring that one someone, especially an introvert.\n\nIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s forcing you to stay in with her every night, she\u2019s fine with you having time with your friends, she just doesn\u2019t want to be included in that. Why can\u2019t you just respect her wishes and love her for who she is? If you feel the need to change who she is as a person, why are you with her? Why not leave and find someone you\u2019re more compatible with instead of trying to force her into being the person you want?\n\nTbh, if I was her I\u2019d see this as a major red flag, and I\u2019d have to seriously consider whether I could ever trust you again. Any future interaction could be a potential ambush.", "YTA. As everyone said already, this was an ambush. You know she would hate it and be uncomfortable.\n\nThese people are close to you but they are strangers to her. That is valid. You have no right to force someone to be friends with anyone - or to socialize. She wasn\u2019t in any hostile relationship with your friends. There was no need for you to get involved. Why would you make her want to \u201ctough it up\u201d? Why would you willingly put anyone in a situation that obviously sucks? I see that you think that\u2019s the \u201cadult\u201d thing to do but unfortunately for you, your partner is honest and knows what she wants. \n\nBut as others have also said - this is a compatibility issue. If this is a dealbreaker for you, that is valid. But again, what you did in the scenario still makes you TA.", "The enemy of an introvert is a surprise or forced social interaction. We are terrible with conversations that aren\u2019t prepared in our head beforehand. \n\nImagine being high af talking to a cop, trying to perfectly execute everything you say but knowing you aren\u2019t fooling anyone. That\u2019s an introvert having small talk.\n\nYTA", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have ambushed her, but her comment about \u201cforcing me to do small talk to people I don\u2019t care about\u201d is a huge red flag. If she cares about you (presumably) and you care about them, that should be enough for her to at least be polite and open to meeting other humans. I\u2019m an introvert too, but ffs, there\u2019s a difference between liking your space/privacy and being flat-out rude.", "I mean, based on the post, it seems like OP has never attempted to communicate w/ their gf about this being a legitimate issue for them. I wonder if they'd ever voiced how frustrating and hurtful it is for them that she has zero interest in meeting or feigning interest in their friends *prior* to the ambush? Like, if she is genuinely asocial, or even neurodivergent, perhaps it genuinely never occurred to her that this might be a source of stress for OP. And OP certainly doesn't seem to understand why she has no interest in socializing with others, especially since their first response to her being upset about the ambush was to belittle her (saying that she's childish, selfish, weak because she couldn't \"just tough it out\", and uncompromising). That doesn't sound like two people who communicate well and understand each other. \n\nThis seems like a problem stemming from a lack of communication just as much as it seems like a potential compatibility problem. *Neither* of them are giving due consideration to the other's perspective, and it seems like the reason is at least partially because neither of them have ever actually *communicated* about it.", "Right, like N T A for your opinion OP, and this is coming from an introvert. She should try to care about the people you care about, and it\u2019s a red flag that she is so averted to that. Honestly it sounds like she may need counseling. Preferring to be alone and not maintain many friendships is totally fine, but having a romantic partner means that a certain level of compromise is required. Her aversion to all socializing sounds like a coping mechanism of sorts.\n\nHowever, ESH for ambushing her and not giving her the time she likely needs to mentally prep for this.\n\nIf your concern is that she would turn down the offer if she knew in advance, I do also understand where you\u2019re coming from, and I would stand to believe I would give someone an ultimatum for this. I am married and my husband and I have very separate social lives, but we do  still know each others friends. I could not imagine meeting his best friends and then throwing a fit like \u201cughh i don\u2019t even care about these peopleeeee\u201d like girl.. grow up lol", "He enjoys interacting with more than one person in real life and she apparently doesn\u2019t. But he is the asshole for ambushing her.", "I don\u2019t think the girlfriend sucks just because she isn\u2019t interested in having friends. I don\u2019t think OP sucks for wanting the woman he loves to meet and get along with his friends. The only reason OP is TA is because he forced her into this situation without her knowledge (likely because he\u2019s going by the don\u2019t ask permission ask for forgiveness philosophy). They\u2019re both probably generally fine people, they\u2019re just not compatible.", "I\u2019m the same way certain situations I shut down verbally and come across as ignoring or a bitch where I\u2019m actually terrified.

There\u2019s no way he doesn\u2019t suck for this.", "I'm an introvert, and if I had a tiring day and my partner sprung socializing on me? I'd probably be aloof with those people too because I just wouldn't have the energy for it or couldn't mentally prepare myself, especially if I was looking forward to quality time with said partner. Not to mention, being blindsided by someone who supposedly cared about me would put me in a bad mood.", "How was her reaction over the top?\n\nIn a healthy relationship people actually communicate instead of *forcing* them into situations they *know* will make their partner uncomfortable", "Yes I don\u2019t see why everyone says he ambushed her.  He can invite whoever he wants over to his place.  He could\u2019ve warned her, but Her reaction is ridiculous.  Leaving out the back door, I\u2019m assuming not telling him?   Time to get a new girlfriend if he wants her to be more social.  She sounds selfish", "It wasn't an ambush? He invited her over and then invited his friend over without telling her so that she would be stuck with meeting them. That's an ambush lmao.", "I'm one of those people that would just rather be home, doing my own projects. \n\nPersonally, if my boyfriend hadn't brought up that he wanted me and his friends to get along, I probably wouldn't have friends outside of the internet. \n\nI don't like hanging out with people, I have to prepare for atleast 3 days to socialize. I am home 24/7 or at my boyfriends house. I don't hang out with people without mental preparation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe if OP and told his girlfriend everything in the begining this could have been avoided. Hell maybe even get her social battery prepared, but don't ambush someone who is an introvert. \n\nSo Op is TA in this situation. And is the TA for not addressing this sooner. NTA for the opinion.", "I get what you're saying but I don't know. She yelled at him \"Are you happy now?\" Inferring that she is very aware he wants to include her in social activities with his friends.", "Honestly her perspective is pretty ridiculous, given the extreme that she takes it to.

She sucks because she isn't even slightly interested in meeting the people who are important to OP -- and specifically calling them \"people I don't care about\". She SHOULD care about them, if only as an extension of caring about her boyfriend.", "The amount he sucks is outweighed by the amount she sucks for defining people by whether or not she cares about them.  I switched from ESH to NTA midway through writing my response because of how she talked about other people who didn\u2019t want anything else but to meet her and introduce themselves.  Like was it a dumb move to spring it on her, yes.  But I honestly can\u2019t blame him for inviting people over to his place, and her reaction was ice cold and informative about her character.", "She didn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m not feeling very social. Bye.\u201d No communication. She snuck out, childish. They both suck.

So he invited his friends over at the same time so that she wouldn't have a choice. He absolutely forced it on her", "It is strongly implied that he did not tell her about the friends coming over. Not telling her someone else is going to be there is forcing her to be in a social situation she doesn't want to be in. Yet again, a healthy relationship involves communicating.
