You didn\u2019t tell her your friends were coming over so it was an ambush. \n\nHowever, for me this would be a deal breaker (the fact she doesn\u2019t want to meet your friends and is unwilling to socialize with them in any capacity). It\u2019s been a year. Shit. You need to decide for yourself if you are compatible long term.", "For this particular situation, YTA. You forced her into something that she didn't want and wasn't ready for. General consensus to me seems like yall aren't compatible. You enjoy socializing, she doesn't. It would be fine if yall were happy and could make it work. But don't force that shizz. Put yourself in other's shoes before you just decide to do things.", "I don't understand people who think completely ignoring someone's boundaries is okay.  And then act all surprised that the person gets upset.  Like what were you expecting? YTA", "YTA. Your girlfriend was up front about not wanting to meet your friends. She set a boundary and instead of trying to convince her compromise or exploring the underlying reasons behind her decision, you tricked her into doing something she does not want to do. \n\nIf her not being willing to hang around your friends is a dealbreaker for you, you can leave her. If you want to try to come to a compromise, you can ask if she is willing.

You literally ambushed her and forced her into a situation she didn't want to be in without even trying to communicate with her.\n\n>She just doesn\u2019t want to socialize. Isn\u2019t that childish ?\n\nNo, it's not childish. Some people naturally do not like socializing, and that's fine. \n\n\n>She can\u2019t even tough it out 1h?\n\nMaybe she could have, if you had even bothered asking her if she could try meeting them for one hour.

If it\u2019s important that your SO embrace your friends, you may need to look elsewhere.", "YTA.  You blindsided her knowing she is introverted and would be uncomfortable.  \n\nIt\u2019s fine to explain your feelings and try to compromise but you can\u2019t just force it upon her.

It sounds like she has severe social anxiety-she stayed \u201cbottled up\u201d the entire time, so her frustration with being forced to socialize (ambushed) came out in a harsh, poorly directed way.", "YTA. I understand your feelings about wanting her to meet your friends, but you did this in the absolute worst way possible. \n\nWhen differences arise with a partner, *you talk to them about it.* If they\u2019re firm on their stance and you can\u2019t live with it, *you go your separate ways*.\n\nYou don\u2019t trick someone into doing something you are well aware they are against.

Dude, she's an introvert, and struggles to make small talk.   You ambushed her with something YOU consider fun but SHE considers torture.   And all because you want to show her off?  Stop it.   She's a human being, not a toy for you to show off to your buddies.", "YTA Because maybe she has social anxiety. Maybe she\u2019s neurodivergent and doing the small talk thing is hella stressful. Maybe she just doesn\u2019t want to be around people she didn\u2019t intentionally choose to be around. There\u2019s a reason for this wether she shared what that is with you or not. She\u2019s a grown woman with a clear boundary that you chose to ingnore and trample because she doesn\u2019t exist the same way as you. The thing to do would have been to have a conversation with her and ask her to meet young friends if for nothing else but to put faces to names. There were so many different ways to approach this and you picked the exact wrong one,", "YTA. She set up a boundary which you didn't respect. If she lets you do your own thing not isolating you to her lifestyle, what's the issue?", "You\u2019re a childish A. All to impress your friends?", "Omg totally TA, I'd be horrified if I were her!!! One thing is if you had asked her FIRST, not all of us want to be exposed and forced to interact with people just like that, not without warning and time to prepare! This may be cos I am ASD but I'd be beyond upset if this happened to me, what is it childish is forcing people to do things, jesus", "YTA - what \u201ccompromises\u201d are you having to make?

You gotta respect that or get out of dodge. Im the same. I don't socialize with anyone. I've had two visits by the same person the past year, its been bliss. I don't wanna hang out with people, I don't wanna go to functions. Thats my choice, Im an adult I get to decide how I like to live. Its not on you to force your opinion on that on me. You sign up to be with a person - you accept who they are - if you can't - then thats your issue.\n\nSome of us just prefer our own company for various reasons. Its not weird or anything - we're just secure enough that we don't need a constant buzz of people around to feel validated. \n\nYou do you.

You pushed her boundaries by the extreme. YTA. By far.", "YTA You can't just trick someone into doing something they've clearly stated they're not ok with. \n\nThat said, if it were me I would not date someone with no friends, or someone who refused to meet my friends, or someone who just placed so little value on friendship.\n\nBut those are not contradictory. You get to control what you do (who you date) not what other people do (who she's willing to meet).", "YTA. Am using someone is manipulation.

Instead you chose to ambush her an disrespect her boundaries.", "100% YTA,\n\n\nWhy would you force her to do something she doesn't want to do? If she is happy the way things are leave her be.", "YTA. You ambushed her, first of all. Second of all, although relationships are about compromise, this is obviously not an issue she is interested in compromising on. Figure out if you can deal with it.  If not, move on.", "I have bad social anxiety and that used to be one of my excuses I used when I'm too embarassed to say its social anxiety. These days I'm comfortable to just be honest and open about it.

If she wants to make friends at some point she will, it's her choice. \n\nI'm the same. I'm an introvert and if I'm by myself, I just do my own thing.

She felt betrayed because you basically lied to her and them ambush her with your friends knowing that she never wants to meet them.\n\nBUT.\n\nI can totally say this, you guys are not compatible. You want a more sociable person whom you can introduce to your friends and have her socialize. She is NOT that person.\n\nIf you've asked her in the past, to bear an hour of socializing for your sake and she refused, then that's it, that's who she really is.

She didn't blow up and leave right away.\n\nIf you want her to interact with your friends that's something you have to discuss with her and if she says no then you have to decide if the relationship can work.\n\nIf she is autistic then the anxiety about small talk, enjoying being alone and the very negative reaction to a surprise all make sense. Of course she might just be introverted or have social anxiety, but regardless you need to respect her boundaries and learn to communicate.", "ESH.

Nobody forces her, nobody judges her and everyone respects this in my family. She put up a boundary and we wouldn\u2019t dream of even attempting to crossing it no matter how much we miss her or want her around.

Describing the whole thing as \u201cforcing her to small talk to people I don\u2019t care about\u201d comes off as aloof and egotistical, and shows she has little to no regard for the relationships that you have.  Personally if I introduced my significant other to my friends and they said that, it would be a deal breaker.  \n\nBlindsiding her with a meet up probably wasn\u2019t the best way to go about it, but her reaction is over the top and dismissive.

I wonder if they'd ever voiced how frustrating and hurtful it is for them that she has zero interest in meeting or feigning interest in their friends *prior* to the ambush? Like, if she is genuinely asocial, or even neurodivergent, perhaps it genuinely never occurred to her that this might be a source of stress for OP. And OP certainly doesn't seem to understand why she has no interest in socializing with others, especially since their first response to her being upset about the ambush was to belittle her (saying that she's childish, selfish, weak because she couldn't \"just tough it out\", and uncompromising). That doesn't sound like two people who communicate well and understand each other. \n\nThis seems like a problem stemming from a lack of communication just as much as it seems like a potential compatibility problem. *Neither* of them are giving due consideration to the other's perspective, and it seems like the reason is at least partially because neither of them have ever actually *communicated* about it.", "Right, like N T A for your opinion OP, and this is coming from an introvert. She should try to care about the people you care about, and it\u2019s a red flag that she is so averted to that. Honestly it sounds like she may need counseling.

Her aversion to all socializing sounds like a coping mechanism of sorts.\n\nHowever, ESH for ambushing her and not giving her the time she likely needs to mentally prep for this.\n\nIf your concern is that she would turn down the offer if she knew in advance, I do also understand where you\u2019re coming from, and I would stand to believe I would give someone an ultimatum for this.

There\u2019s things you simply just don\u2019t say. OP\u2019s GF isn\u2019t innocent in all of this.", "\nIt\u2019s just weird to me I guess . I just don\u2019t get how somebody like this can function in college or in the workplace if you have these kind of issues with people. \n\nI would probably advise Op  to  break up with her , I don\u2019t know how he copes with this when they are so different . Op Nta", "Yes, this exactly. \n\nShe doesn't *have* to change or compromise who she is. That alone, at least in this instance, doesn't make her an AH. \n\nIf OP *has* communicated about this issue before (feeling like they're the only one compromising/making sacrifices, feeling hurt and frustrated that she won't meet/engage with their friends, feeling confused as to the root of their gf's behavior, etc) and she simply ignored it, then that gets her much closer to AH territory. \n\nIf OP *hasn't* explicitly and clearly communicated any of the above, however, then they very likely have no one to blame but themselves for their increasing frustration. Nobody is a mind reader and things that seem obvious to some aren't actually all that obvious to others. It's perfectly rational that someone who doesn't socialize often or have any friends of her own wouldn't realize that partners generally like to have their SOs meet, engage with, and be familiar with their friends. Just like it's perfectly rational that someone like OP, who *does* socialize regularly and has friends important to them, wouldn't instinctively understand why their gf is behaving the way that she is, or why she has the perspective that she does towards socializing. \n\nHealthy relationships rely on clear, consistent communication and compromise. Problems shouldn't be \"me versus you\", revolving around the pinning of blame/guilt, or the designation of right/wrong or winner/loser; they should be \"us versus the problem\", revolving around genuinely understanding one another's perspectives and coming up with realistic, mutually beneficial solutions. And OP's saying, \"you should stop being childish and either change who you are fundamentally or learn how to tough it out despite your misery/discomfort/boredom/etc because that's what *I* want from you\" isn't a realistic *or* mutually beneficial solution. In this case, the gf's saying, \"You should stop making such a big deal of this, learn how to just get over it, and accept that I will simply *never* hang out with your friends no matter how important it is to you\" wouldn't be, either.", "My reading is that he had one birthday party with friends and another just with her.\n\nHe seems irritated he couldn't combine them.", "Mm. I can't really articulate why I think that's a bad idea, which might indicate that it's completely irrational, but nonetheless it's how I feel.\n\nI guess I want more involvement in their life, personally, and getting to know who they associate with is a good way to achieve that.", "Yeah when I meant obvious to everyone I was including those who are autistic and the like. Is it not one of those pop culture things?\n\nI suppose not! We all need to rethink our assumptions on knowledge.", "No, it just means I know how navigate social situations skillfully and I know how to say \u201cI won\u2019t be there, but here\u2019s my gift.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s called being an adult rather than someone who just does whatever is \u201csupposed\u201d to be done.  So maybe you are an immature person and a follower.  \n\nSince we are calling each other names.", "By your estimation, she is wrong.  I disagree.  I don\u2019t go to my best friend\u2019s parties but always send a gift, and she is happy with that.  \n\nI\u2019m not making a false anything.  You are just deciding this is the line.  It is *your* line, not everyone\u2019s.", "And my SO doesn\u2019t spring them on me without telling me either.  You seem to be willfully ignoring the context and acting like she said this out of nowhere.", "Could be so. I'd like if OP could edit the post with more context", "Which is perfectly fine. There isn't a right or wrong here. I've been married for 24 years, have 2 kids, and I still don't really socialize with my wife's friends. My wife has fairly limited contact with my friends as well.", "It\u2019s most people\u2019s line , you\u2019re acting like most people would not think this is very bad and odd behaviour. How did you function at work or at college ?", "Not once did I say OP is an angel that made no mistakes. No shit he shouldn\u2019t have done that. But clearly this problem is bigger than a single situation of less than 30 minutes.\n\nShe literally wouldn\u2019t spend a birthday with him and his friends. For like *a few hours*. A day that\u2019s not about her. My problem here is all the OP\u2019s gf apologists saying she\u2019s a saint for not wanting to socialize, and that everything she\u2019s done is okay.", "Yeah too much is ambiguous and this sub is speculating away, like it always does. Clarification would be welcome.", "Yeah I mean you don't need to hang out necessarily. Some societies including western ones until recently, are sex segregated and that alone is going to mean you don't know them well.\n\nBut OPs scenario they'd never even been in the same room together until that point. That seems a little rarer, to not maintain at least an acquaintance status.", "I am a professional.  I function very well.  My colleagues just know I\u2019m quiet and not super-social.  But I am a decent colleague and nice person.  \n\nSocializing is not required.  I made it through a phd and career just fine, thank you.  \n\nStop thinking your world is the only world.", "But I did not say she is completely blameless either.  So why are you acting like I did?  I don\u2019t think she handled it well.  But I think the OP is at fault more for ambushing her."]}
