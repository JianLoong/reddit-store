I never saw Lydia very often growing up, maybe 3 times a year, up to five some years. This is in contrast to my other cousins who I saw very often and am very close with, but Lydia isn't really that close to any of us, and my aunt isn't very close to her siblings either.\n\nFor context, my family is quite strict about social media. We have profiles, but when we were younger all our parents had the rule that we had to keep our social media profiles private, and there were certain things about our lifestyle that we weren't allowed to post. If we did, there were varying degrees of 'punishment' - normally you'd just get your bank cards restricted for a week. Lydia was the only one of us who never had this rule, and would frequently post things on family holidays that would get her in trouble with the other parents. Even though we don't have that rule now, we all still keep to it to some degree (except Lydia).\n\nRecently, I found out through one of my other cousins that Lydia has social media accounts where she shares my pictures and videos and pretends that they're hers, except this profile is public and has thousands of followers. I was upset about this because even though they were just videos of my partying or travel etc., I didn't consent to any of it being viewed by strangers. In addition, I find it very weird that Lydia is screenshotting/recording my life to pretend it's her own. I blocked the account that Lydia used to follow me on all my social media profiles but didn't say anything else about it.\n\nRecently we were on a family ski trip (my aunt, her husband, and Lydia were not there). Lydia messaged the family group chat saying she couldn't find my profile on IG and did I delete it. I replied in the group chat that I blocked her because I know she was stealing my content and using it to get followers on another account. All my cousins knew about the accounts but the parents didn't and both Lydia and her mother have been getting angry calls and messages from the whole family saying that what she did was dangerous and unhinged and that she needs professional help. My parents said that is she didn't take the profile down that they would get their lawyer involved, so she deleted the profiles. Lydia is now saying that I've ruined her relationships with everyone in the family, and potential work opportunities over a few videos of shopping and holidays. She said that since she didn't use any content of me (she never used anything that showed my face) that it wasn't a big deal and I shouldn't have got her in trouble, but honestly I think what she did was creepy. My family is on my wide but one of my cousins and a few of my friends said a lot of people steal content and while it's weird, it's not harmful, and that maybe I should have just left her blocked and not said anything else.", "created_utc": 1673634058, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b1gow/aita_for_telling_my_family_my_cousin_is/", "score": 1961, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you really did just say you blocked her because she was reposting your content without permission that's totally reasonable and your family being upset has nothing to with you.\n\nThe real gem here is that you lost her work opportunities over videos... Which I guess means she was using your videos to apply for jobs or to try to get brand deals on social media. It's unbelievable that she feels entitled to steal your content and try to sell it. You really need to report these social media profiles as impersonating you and hope they get taken down because if she does it herself she'll probably just re-download the content and post it somewhere else.", "NTA This wasn\u2019t just stealing \u201csome content.\u201d Like that\u2019s really creepy behavior of your cousin and I can\u2019t believe anyone would condone it", "NTA.  very creepy here and not normal.

Also, she\u2019s using your face to post whatever she wants and that can be detrimental to especially when searching for a job, they check that stuff. \n\nShe\u2019s also being incredibly deceitful. I had a cousin who once stole my friends email addresses from my book ( this was early 2000\u2019s btw) and harassed them for weeks before her mom would do shit about it.

AND A criminal offence.\n\nTell Lydia this.", "NTA. This behavior was disturbing.

What you reported was factual.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. Stealing content, mixing content with something questionable. Tell them there's no harm when something is posted, and it cost you a job. Companies check social media. If it's, you face and name in most of it must be yours.", "NTA. It's not okay just because it's common, and it most certainly is harmful. What happens if her account with thousands of followers gets a stalker? They're not going to be finding Lydia's location from those photos. What happens if a potential employer finds the account and doesn't approve of the contents for whatever reason? Lydia isn't the one who'll lose that opportunity. There are a thousand ways that what she did is dangerous and potentially harmful. It being social media doesn't mean it counts less. You were content to let it lie until she brought up your Insta. What was the conclusion going to be if you said nothing? Your family knows that you didn't delete your account, it's not a leap to guess you blocked her.

It wasn't a big deal that I was stalking you, documenting everything you did, and impersonating you online for attention\"\n\nI think you should ditch that one cousin and those friends, because one time content theft is different from someone creating an entire profile pretending to be you, and still lashing out and saying that you're wrong for feeling fouled that a member of your family was recording every single piece of media she was able to find a view, and was pretending to be you.\n\nYou had a right to defend your autonomy and your identity", "I would also add If stealing content was normal there wouldn't be trademark and copyright laws. \n\nStealing content without acknowledging the original creator is vile.

Especially if your cousin says anything on her socials that could be construed as offensive to the wrong people. That could trigger a witch hunt in order to doxx her for more personal information (home address, employment, ect.) and you could get caught up in that mess.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to say that just because those close to you wouldn't mistake the profile as being yours, people close to them may not be as discerning.

It's impersonation", "An audio sample is a different story. As long as someone asks for permission to use a sample of something you originally created, then you can give them the okay to use it. Any kind of artwork (including music) automatically has certain copyright protections, but it\u2019s always best to have your work legally copyrighted for additional protections.\n\nThe difference with this is that someone is actually pretending to you and is essentially stealing your identity online, so this can land them into legal trouble, especially if they are doing this for fraudulent purposes.", "Indeed, and she wasn't just singing a song you wrote and pretending it was hers, she was pretending to be you. And she'd been doing it for a while and had no plans to stop.

You didn't hurt Lydia's relationship with one single member of the family; Lydia's behavior is completely responsible for that!

That is still really shitty and fake but it's way less fucked up faking a lifestyle than catfishing the world with your cousins likeness. She probably thought hey here's this account no one has I can use their great content to gain followers, maybe I can become an influencer or some shit.
