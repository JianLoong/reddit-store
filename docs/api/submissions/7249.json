I never saw Lydia very often growing up, maybe 3 times a year, up to five some years. This is in contrast to my other cousins who I saw very often and am very close with, but Lydia isn't really that close to any of us, and my aunt isn't very close to her siblings either.\n\nFor context, my family is quite strict about social media. We have profiles, but when we were younger all our parents had the rule that we had to keep our social media profiles private, and there were certain things about our lifestyle that we weren't allowed to post. If we did, there were varying degrees of 'punishment' - normally you'd just get your bank cards restricted for a week. Lydia was the only one of us who never had this rule, and would frequently post things on family holidays that would get her in trouble with the other parents. Even though we don't have that rule now, we all still keep to it to some degree (except Lydia).\n\nRecently, I found out through one of my other cousins that Lydia has social media accounts where she shares my pictures and videos and pretends that they're hers, except this profile is public and has thousands of followers. I was upset about this because even though they were just videos of my partying or travel etc., I didn't consent to any of it being viewed by strangers. In addition, I find it very weird that Lydia is screenshotting/recording my life to pretend it's her own. I blocked the account that Lydia used to follow me on all my social media profiles but didn't say anything else about it.\n\nRecently we were on a family ski trip (my aunt, her husband, and Lydia were not there). Lydia messaged the family group chat saying she couldn't find my profile on IG and did I delete it. I replied in the group chat that I blocked her because I know she was stealing my content and using it to get followers on another account. All my cousins knew about the accounts but the parents didn't and both Lydia and her mother have been getting angry calls and messages from the whole family saying that what she did was dangerous and unhinged and that she needs professional help. My parents said that is she didn't take the profile down that they would get their lawyer involved, so she deleted the profiles. Lydia is now saying that I've ruined her relationships with everyone in the family, and potential work opportunities over a few videos of shopping and holidays. She said that since she didn't use any content of me (she never used anything that showed my face) that it wasn't a big deal and I shouldn't have got her in trouble, but honestly I think what she did was creepy. My family is on my wide but one of my cousins and a few of my friends said a lot of people steal content and while it's weird, it's not harmful, and that maybe I should have just left her blocked and not said anything else.", "created_utc": 1673634058, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b1gow/aita_for_telling_my_family_my_cousin_is/", "score": 406, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you hadn't told her you blocked her everyone else would have said they could see it, she would have figured out you blocked her, and it would have come out that way. If you really did just say you blocked her because she was reposting your content without permission that's totally reasonable and your family being upset has nothing to with you.\n\nThe real gem here is that you lost her work opportunities over videos... Which I guess means she was using your videos to apply for jobs or to try to get brand deals on social media. It's unbelievable that she feels entitled to steal your content and try to sell it. You really need to report these social media profiles as impersonating you and hope they get taken down because if she does it herself she'll probably just re-download the content and post it somewhere else.", "NTA This wasn\u2019t just stealing \u201csome content.\u201d Like that\u2019s really creepy behavior of your cousin and I can\u2019t believe anyone would condone it", "NTA.  very creepy here and not normal.

Is OP supposed to wait until it is?\n\nCousin deserved to be called out on this and she is the one that brought all this on herself.", "NTA.\n\nWhat Lydia did is wrong and creepy.\n\nMost people don't \"steal\" content.  If they re-post something, they give credit to the person who created the content whenever possible.  It's easy to forget that people have rights to the content they create when it's so easy to share content on the internet.", "It IS weird and COULD be harmful.

If she hadn't called you out for blocking her, you wouldn't have told anyone what she was up to.", "NTA. What she did is dangerous and unhinged. It\u2019s dangerous to you because you don\u2019t know who is following that public account and unfortunately there are creeps out in the world who use social media as their playground. Also, she\u2019s using your face to post whatever she wants and that can be detrimental to especially when searching for a job, they check that stuff. \n\nShe\u2019s also being incredibly deceitful. I had a cousin who once stole my friends email addresses from my book ( this was early 2000\u2019s btw) and harassed them for weeks before her mom would do shit about it. She was jealous I had friends and she didn\u2019t so she wanted to ruin that", ">one of my cousins and a few of my friends said a lot of people steal content and while it's weird, it's not harmful\n\nnot harmful?, she's practically stalking you!, that's creepy and potentially dangerous\n\nNTA, your cousin needs help ASAP and whoever says it's \"harmless\", needs a brain check", "NTA. She was asking because she was looking for more content to steal. The family on her side can record videos and share their pictures with her if they think it's no big deal.", "NTA. This is weird lol.", "NTA, but I honestly would have given her a tiny bit of leeway if she wasn't showing your face or anything like that.  \n\nIt's bad, but at least she had some line", "Stealing content from other social media accounts can be harmful and impersonating other people is more than a little weird.  It seems likely that your family has considerable resources, so putting that out there makes you a target for kidnappers and other forms of fraudulent behavior.  All that being said, you might be a (soft) Y.T.A for not confronting her directly and giving her an opportunity to take it down before broadcasting her misbehavior to the entire family.  It is kind of creepy behavior on her part, but it also sounds like her circumstances are different from the rest of your generation in the family and she might be jealous, possibly with reason.", ">one of my cousins and a few of my friends said a lot of people steal content and while it's weird, it's not harmful\n\nThey are very wrong. NTA", "NTA. The reason everyone is mad at her is because it was wrong.", "NTA. IT IS HARMFUL!!! You did the right thing.", "NTA.  She was stealing your intellectual property and presenting it as her own. That kind of stuff gets people fired and kicked out of university. She should be apologizing to you instead of complaining about the natural fallout from *her own actions*.", "NTA it\u2019s identity theft and it\u2019s Not a trivial thing but a Very serious crime. \n\nShe is extremely lucky you aren\u2019t pressing charges.", "Precisely this. Her reaction demonstrates that she knew that what she was doing was wrong.", "I\u2019m not too worried about that because she wasn\u2019t using pictures of me, just pictures and videos I was taking. There were pictures of her on the account so she wasn\u2019t fraudulently assuming my identity, just more like she was living my life, if that makes sense. Nobody would look at her profile and think it was mine, more that people who follow that profile would think she was doing everything I was doing.", "NTA as she also violated YOUR privacy. Doesn't matter if your face wasn't shown. She had no right to steal and post your stuff.", "Hah!! I snorted >\\_< !", "Nothing petty about answering the question, what was she supposed to do when asked lie and cover for her?", "How was it petty? If she did nothing wrong it wouldn't matter who knew.", "The pictures you took are YOURS, even if you shared them on social media.", "NTA. If she got work opportunities because of your posts, she'd be profiting off of your content. So basically, she'd be stealing money that should be yours. Beware of any fake accounts she might create to try again.", "NTA she's definitely the problem how dare she get upset with you", "NTA", "NTA,  and sorry but this is called identity theft. AND A criminal offence.\n\nTell Lydia this.", "NTA. This behavior was disturbing. It was right to inform your family because this behavior could escalate and she might eventually start stealing videos and photos of other family members. It's good that this is known so others can safeguard themselves and so Lydia could be called out or get help.", "NTA.", ">a lot of people steal content and while it's weird, it's not harmful\n\nIt can definitely be harmful. Imagine if you were trying to use some of your own work professionally, and someone discovers that it's \"stolen\" from this other IG account. You end up looking dishonest, while she benefits from your work.\n\n(This might not apply to you, but it could definitely apply to someone who's work is stolen)\n\nETA: NTA", ">a lot of people steal content \n\nAnd every one of them is an asshole.

A lot of people does all sorts of crazy shit, it doesn't make any of it right.\n\nNTA. Your cousin is blaming you for the consequences of her own actions. She knew what she did was wrong, that's why she didn't tell anyone.", "Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. She was doing something dishonest and idiotic. What you reported was factual.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. Stealing content, mixing content with something questionable. Tell them there's no harm when something is posted, and it cost you a job. Companies check social media. If it's, you face and name in most of it must be yours.", "NTA. It's not okay just because it's common, and it most certainly is harmful. What happens if her account with thousands of followers gets a stalker? They're not going to be finding Lydia's location from those photos. What happens if a potential employer finds the account and doesn't approve of the contents for whatever reason? Lydia isn't the one who'll lose that opportunity. There are a thousand ways that what she did is dangerous and potentially harmful. It being social media doesn't mean it counts less. You were content to let it lie until she brought up your Insta. What was the conclusion going to be if you said nothing? Your family knows that you didn't delete your account, it's not a leap to guess you blocked her. If you stay silent, it's YOUR reputation in the family that takes the hit for blocking her for \"no reason\"", "This is what I want to have happen whenever somebody tries to justify their crappy actions. It's like, okay, if you really think that what you did was alright, then you wouldn't mind if I publicly posted about it on social media or to a family group chat, right? Oh, what's that? It would make you look bad? Now why would that be? Didn't you just say it was okay? I'm not sure I understand, please explain.", "And the one cousin and friends would/should have no problems with her taking their photos and videos, too.", "Never gets anywhere.
