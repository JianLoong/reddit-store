I spoke to his teacher, Mrs T , and said he has an appointment on Friday that he can't miss and if he could possibly do this report on Monday.\nShe asked why can't he do it on Thursday. I said that was a totally fair question but there's something going on with him and he's emotionally distraught. I don't want him breaking down in class and being made fun of.\nShe said there was no good excuse to punt an oral exam because Dawson has the jitters.\n\nI said it's way more than that. She said he can give his oral report Thursday or Friday or take a zero. I said I understand and he'll take a zero. Your class isn't important in the grand scheme of things anyways. My son's emotional health is way more important. She was surprised that I said to give him a zero because I'm a very involved dad. She told me to be upfront with her about what was going on and I said I'm not telling you anymore.\n\nLater I got a call from the vice principal who said that I had a \"hostile\" conversation with Mrs T and requested that she give my son a zero. I said that's not really accurate. I told him off the record that my son has to give a victim impact statement on Friday. He's a mess. \n\nHe quickly said by all means let him stay home tomorrow and Friday. He'd work something out with his teachers. I said I do NOT want anyone knowing his business. He assured me be wouldn't give any reason.\n\nI got an email from Mrs T who said she wished that I had been more open about what was going on because she cares about Dawson. She's worried about him now. I responded that I didn't tell her details because you and especially your son (he's in the same grade as Dawson) are gossip queens and I don't trust you. She told me that what I said was very hurtful. I said then don't ask and don't fish for information.\n\nEdit: The VP did NOT disclose why my son is out tomorrow and Friday. He said it was an approved absence and to send makeup work home today.

If you trust the principal to enough to say that he didn't tell her your reasons, then she went out of her way to find something you were trying to keep private/a small group of people. She should have just lived with \"it's something serious but we don't want to get into the details right now.\"", "I don't understand the people trying to say otherwise, but you are firmly NTA. Even if she weren't a blabbermouth, she is not entitled to know why your son will be absent, and it's her professional responsibility to take you at your word that it's a legitimate absence, especially since you don't make a habit of demanding he be excused from assignments.\n\nIn this case, she pushed and pushed for sensitive private information to which she is not entitled. What you told her was enough for any intelligent person to understand that this was a serious matter and she should not pry further. By continuing to do so and tattling to the VP about it when she didn't get her way, it confirmed your initial impulse not to disclose. The information would likely be all over the school by now had you told her.", "NTA. Are you in the EU? This would warrant a GDPR data breach report. You explicitly did not consent to the teacher knowing the reason for absence and that privacy was ignored.", "NTA. You should report this additional conversation to the VP, and explain why you were not comfortable sharing further information with this teacher. She should not be messaging you about her feelings. She's unprofessional.", "NTA. \n\nIf she cared about Dawson like she claimed, she would have taken your word at face value that there were outside issues impacting his emotional health. \n\nShe is his teacher, she's owed knowing *when* assignments or tests will not be completed but she is not always owed the *why* unless it impacts the full function of her class or her safety.", "NTA\n\nYou get the benefit of the doubt that she is a gossip queen. \n\n>requested that she give my son a zero.\n\nThe fact that this is her version of events supports your decision not to trust her. \n\n>Your class isn't important in the grand scheme of things anyways. My son's emotional health is way more important.\n\nBoth of those statements are true. One assignment in a middle school social studies course is utterly insignificant when compared to one's mental health. Even the arguments about school teaching 'responsibility' and 'life skills' are meaningless unless you are REGULARLY allowing your son to skip assignments. \n\n>She told me that what I said was very hurtful. I said then don't ask and don't fish for information.\n\nShe was hurt because she saw the truth in what you said. And you only said it because she wouldn't leave it alone. The vice principal made a decision and relayed that decision to the appropriate parties. There was no need for her to contact you about the issue again. But she did, and she got told. That's on her.", "So wait, did the principal end up telling the teacher anyway? Even after you told him 'off the record'?!\n\nMan eff that guy and the teacher if that's true. I hate it when things aren't relevant to someone unless they get aaaaall the details they want, to use it as gossip cache and as their own personal drama( I know your son is going through something horrific right now, but now that I know *I'm so distraught*)\n\nI'd find  a way to get a gag order on those two\n\nNTA", "NTA but the teacher sure is. Why does the teacher feel entitled to so much info? Hearing from the child\u2019s parent that their kid has a conflict should have been enough. I can see why you don\u2019t trust her.

And he may have violated his professional ethics so you might have recourse if you choose to go that route.\n\nI don't know that telling Mrs. T the personal reason you didn't share with her was really the best move. Particularly regarding her own son. She doesn't need to know the reason you didn't tell her any more than she needed to know the reason that your son needed accommocation. Your judgement alone is sufficient in either matter.\n\nBut you were 100% right to tell her that you only told her was because she pushed which wasn't her place to begin with.\n\nTotally NTA.", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nYou handled it perfectly.", "NTA as soon as you tell the teacher it's an appointment, and the reason for said appointment is private, they should have stopped prying. It's no business of theirs what the appointment is, but I would think most people would have assumed it was medically-related when you said that, so known they should not ask for more details after that. They know they have no legal right to demand medical information.  Likewise for a court appointment. If your kid was in court because of something they were accused of (I know that isn't the case here) she wouldn't have a right to even know your child was going to court, because of laws protecting juvenile offenders. The teacher is a nosy busybody just for prying, regardless of your motivation not to tell them.", "NTA and I would even more blunt with the teacher - I don't trust you with his private information. You do not know how to keep private information confidential and I have no trust you would maintain his safety or privacy.", "Nta. \nDid the vice principal tell the teacher the reason then? Is that her son?

If that's the case, then you're doing this person a favor. It may be hurtful but they need to hear it if they are to be better. The fact that it hurts means there's a chance. \n\nSo, no way are you TA for looking out for your kid, and frankly, as I see it, you gave constructive criticism- it only hurt because it rang true.", "NTA. That teacher sucks.", "Forward the email to the Vice Principal and the Principal. The way this teacher is acting needs to be addressed.

Who is left. I. My kids high school we have the gossipy cafeteria lady with barely a highschool education teaching life skills. \n\nThis teacher holds vapes for kids and tried failing students for telling on her. She bullies, she doesn't teach. She uses the kids as her own personal cooks for her family dinners. It's an awful situation. Yet she is still there. Does the principal know? Absolutely. Does the admin care, no. \n\nWe are left with mainly bottom of the barrel teachers now. We have so many that haven't even gotten a certificate yet. So no not the AH. \n\nI just want to say I love the good teachers, but there are so few now that haven't quit or given up.

Teachers aren\u2019t mind readers and with the crap parents they deal with someone, they don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or just an attempt to get out of work.", "You were combative from the start. Quite frankly I don\u2019t even think this is a real story, but clearly the vice principal went and told all the teachers exactly what was going on since the teacher you were rude to emailed you and seemingly knew what the real reason was.\n\nWhether or not you\u2019re right about the teacher being a gossip, starting off the conversation by being all cloak and dagger and then telling her that her course doesn\u2019t matter when she wouldn\u2019t agree to your demand without details makes you and asshole. Whether or not she is one is up for debate.", "You should have been more upfront and spared everyone their time.  You can say the bare minimum while conveying the gravity of the situation and the impact it has on your son.  I\u2019m mostly voting YTA because that last response to her didn\u2019t need to happen at all.  Good for you for doing good by your son though.", "Yta your situation was legit but you want special treatment without explaining the reasoning for it\n\nWhat ridiculous convo that was\n\nYour reasoning not withstanding you should have gotten him taken out of class via the admin office and not gave such vague convo", "Gonna get downvoted for this one, but ESH. Teacher sounds difficult, tho you could have communicated much better and the post is missing a lot of info. The wording can help with such things. You said the below\n\n>an appointment on Friday that he can't miss and if he could possibly do this report on Monday.\n\nThis sounds like a doctor's appointment. \n\n>but there's something going on with him and he's emotionally distraught. \n\nRather than say he's emotionally distraught, as that could be anything and pins the issue on the kid, saying it's a legal appointment and a confidential family matter would be more direct (and more accurate) in terms of getting it across. If she pushes after that, then she'd be a massive asshole. \n\nMy interpretation would be an appointment, he's emotionally distraught, sounds like a serious health concern. I'd be worried about the kid. The comment about getting jitters is weird and out of place and she obviously misinterpreted what you said. And without a justification, it would sound like a parent trying to get their kid out of an exam (happens a lot). If a parent says there's an appointment and the kid's worried, that sounds a lot less serious and puts a lot more focus on the kid's emotional state then the kid has a legal appointment about a confidential family matter and cannot be in school Thurs and Fri. It takes the attention away from the kid's emotional state and on to the fact it's a serious appointment. \n\nUp to this point, it's a simple misunderstanding from what you describe. But then you snapped. Responding to the email (of course only she emailed you, you only had a run in with her), by saying she and her son are gossip queens *is* harsh. You had a misunderstanding, and then you clearly snapped and made things personal. In no way is this gonna help your kid... You gave no evidence of the gossip queen thing in the post and it came out of nowhere. Again, you can just say there's a legal appointment about a confidential family matter. Kid can't be in school. You decided to make it personal with her, and insult her and that's going to be your relationship with the teacher moving forward. And again, ain't gonna help your kid. Without the teacher finding out the actual reason and how serious the matter really is, and being given evidence of her gossip in a similar confidential situation, I don't see any reason she'd forgive you from her perspective. And your kid suffers for that too.", "For the specific question you've asked I'm gonna say YTA. You invalidated yourself by insulting her. \n\nTruthfully, whether she is a gossip or not, the point is if the info is personal, it's personal and she shouldn't have kept pushing. Which is what you should have said. If your son is truly an engaged student and you are an involved parent she should have taken your word for it rather than pester you for info. That is where she is an AH here.", "YTA for saying her class doesn't matter and calling her a gossip queen, lol.\n\nI get that different teachers take different levels of excuse for missing exams. However once she said no to your first explanation, I'm sure you could have tactfully found a way to say more without saying it all.  No, instead you hurled insults. You could have said 'it's a private matter with my son and that's all I am willing to explain'. \n\nOnce you start insulting, good luck getting her to work with you rationally, and now you've made the situation really really uncomfortable for your son for the rest of the year.", "YTA, you purposefully went out of your way to not provide necessary information and the teacher reacted properly given what she knew.\n\nBrining in admin when a parent is choosing to be hostile and ignorant is normal operating procedure.\n\nA very involved father would not have accepted a zero.\n\nBeing an asshole appears to have been your goal, and you succeeded.", "You were N T A until you called her a \"gossip queen\" - true or not, she said she cared about your son.  You should have put on your grown-parent-pants and patched up.  \"Thanks so much for caring about him.\"  Then ignore any fishing.  Your poor kid has to be in her class and you are calling his teacher and classmate \"gossip queens.\"  Right or wrong, this may influence how the teacher treats you son.  \n\nI can't stand when parents have to have the last word instead of trying to make sure that their kid has the very best relationship they can in school.  My kids had some awful teachers and I made sure not to fan the flames, while also taking care of my kid (not responding to fishing but being kind about it or in one case, moving me kid to another class).

That's completely inappropriate behavior from a teacher who has no idea how serious the kid's appointment is. Again, it could be anything from a serious health situation to the loss of a loved one. Her callous response shows just how unsuited she is to being a teacher. \n\nBut ignoring all that for the moment, there's plenty of compromises available if the teacher doesn't want to change Monday's in-class schedule, like having the kid come in early in the day or staying late, or doing it during lunch period, or even vidoing it at home and sending it in. She can negotiate how much to grade his work if he can't give an oral presentation in front of the call and just grade him on his written work, too. But to say \"it's this day or the highway\" without trhing to find a solution that works for both of them and then get upset when OP chooses to put his kid's emotional needs first is ridiculous."]}
