The baby will be two months old in a few days. They\u2019ve been posting pics and videos of the baby on social media basically since he was born. In the last month, they\u2019ve been posting pics and videos where this woman (who always dresses like she is some kind of nurse) is doing \u201cexercises\u201d with the baby. My problem is that it\u2019s not gentle massaging or anything like that, this woman is doing full-on gymnastics with the baby \u2013 flipping him, making him basically stand on her hands, balancing him in that \u201cstanding\u201d position, putting him on his tummy and making him lift his head. I don\u2019t even know what else she is doing to the baby that doesn\u2019t get posted on social media.\n\nThe baby is always crying (looks like he\u2019s screaming even) on the pics and he looked absolutely terrified and confused on the video where the woman flipped him. My aunt, who is my cousin\u2019s mother, called me and my mum and told us that she\u2019s worried about the baby because he\u2019s always crying so much, but when she voiced her concerns, my cousin and his wife started locking the door when the woman is there with the baby to prevent my aunt from going there and doing something.\n\nI find these \u201cexercises\u201d absolutely crazy and feel like they shouldn\u2019t be done on a child this young. I\u2019m not a doctor nor a nurse but I\u2019ve always read that people have to be very cautious with newborns\u2019 necks because they can\u2019t support their head. Also, parents should start introducing babies to exercise when they\u2019re about 6 months old, but even then it should just be gentle massaging, gentle stretching and stuff. No crazy flips and turns and fucking somersaults.\n\nMy mum and I decided that we will call my cousin and talk to him. We went the diplomatic way and just said that we found the exercises unsuitable for a two-months-old and that we think they should reconsider. My cousin told us that they\u2019ve attended courses on how to care for newborns and that he and his wife are raising their baby according to science. He also said that the woman is certified and has completed some courses or whatever. He thinks these exercises make the baby healthy and strong and that they boost the baby\u2019s immunity. The call ended with my cousin saying that he will think about what we\u2019re saying but I have a feeling that he was annoyed.\n\nI have to add that it looks like the woman is doing this for a living and she probably has some kind of technique when she's flipping the baby and balancing him (meaning she might have done some courses). But I still think that she shouldn't be doing this to two-months-olds at all.\n\nAITA for criticizing my cousin and his wife for letting that woman do these \u201cexercises\u201d with the baby?

I guess it fades after a while 'cos I remember choking on a ton of water when I was 5 years old and learning to swim from my dad.\n\nBut here's a question maybe someone knows the answer to - what does spinning a baby around and balancing them on your hand like they were some sort of freaky acrobat have to do with boosting the immune system? Surely the best way to improve a babies immune system in the first few months is to be breast fed (y'know the mothers antibodies and stuff gets passed along to the baby). Anyone know?", "Mine didn't like it either, I feel better knowing I didn't ruin him forever because I didn't do it much. Note: he's 5 now.", "There has been a lot of pseudoscience out there for a while suggesting that stress will improve their immune system.

They hate it, it\u2019s work for them, but it\u2019s important for building neck strength, as well as the muscles needed for things like rolling over, crawling, and eventually walking. The other stuff sounds really crazy and dangerous (I\u2019m reminded of the baptism video where the priest really aggressively dunks the infants, it\u2019s terrifying). \n\nSo I\u2019m going NTA. I\u2019m not sure exactly what you can do though, besides some of the suggestions already listed. Maybe find a way to forward their videos to their pediatrician, get their take on it.

That is insane and I would legitimately call CPS and at least ask if that\u2019s safe because I am a parent and that looks incredibly unsafe and like torture!", "Oof. NTA. I was gonna say laying baby stomach for tummy time is normal. You want them to learn to stretch those muscles and get strong. But this sounds hella crazy. I\u2019d definitely report it to whatever local child advocacy program you have.", "NTA send videos of these sessions to child protection services.

Your heart and concerns are in the right spot, but the method used, based on the OP - yeah, that is a bit rough and borderline YTA... so long as there is no abuse going on, one should never tell another parent how to raise their kids... Hypothetically, if the roles were reversed, and someone had concerns about how you were raising your child, how would you want to be approached about it? If your answer is different from how you approached your cousin, then yeah, YTA...", "Have you contacted CPS yet?", "NTA this baby is 2 months thats too young for these things,  please save the video call CPS and report it,they can check out this women's credentials and see if she is possiblely putting other children at risk.

There's a type of physical therapy called DMI, which sounds a lot like what you're describing, but is typically done with slightly older babies with motor delays.

The \"practitioner \" too.  \n\nI don't want to tell you what to do,  but this sounds insanely crazy and I think they've been duped.

This is immediate, urgent bad situation here. \n\nMaybe I'm totally ignorant to this whole technique. I would absolutely love to be.  For that poor baby's sake. I  know one thing for absolute certain though.\n\nIt would one million percent NOT hurt the baby AT ALL  to STOP  this from continuing.\n\nKicking down doors. I aint joking.", "What is their idea of science???

The only one that seems \"normal\" is putting the baby on his tummy so he can try to lift his own head. \n\nNow that kids don't sleep on their stomachs, and now that they often spend a fair amount of time in the car seat carrier, they don't get much chance to practice this, which is a step toward the charming \"airplane\", rolling, then sitting and crawling. \n\nAny holding in standing so they can do that jumpy leg thing, which they often like a lot, should probably wait another 4-6 weeks, until he has more neck strength. Then, you hook your thumbs in the armpits and run the flats of your hands up behind  the head in support. \n\nAnything with sudden motion sounds dangerous.\n\nWith tiny babies, better safe than sorry.

Babies reflexively hold their breath until around the sixth month mark. Then they lose the reflex but quickly figure out how to hold their breath with the right cues. I knew a little girl who had started aquatics before she was a year old and by the time she was old enough for an independent class at three she could safely swim across the length of the pool i worked at, jump off the diving board and get herself back to a ladder and go down the water slide and to the stairs. It was amazing."]}
