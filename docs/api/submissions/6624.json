The baby will be two months old in a few days. They\u2019ve been posting pics and videos of the baby on social media basically since he was born. In the last month, they\u2019ve been posting pics and videos where this woman (who always dresses like she is some kind of nurse) is doing \u201cexercises\u201d with the baby. My problem is that it\u2019s not gentle massaging or anything like that, this woman is doing full-on gymnastics with the baby \u2013 flipping him, making him basically stand on her hands, balancing him in that \u201cstanding\u201d position, putting him on his tummy and making him lift his head. I don\u2019t even know what else she is doing to the baby that doesn\u2019t get posted on social media.\n\nThe baby is always crying (looks like he\u2019s screaming even) on the pics and he looked absolutely terrified and confused on the video where the woman flipped him. My aunt, who is my cousin\u2019s mother, called me and my mum and told us that she\u2019s worried about the baby because he\u2019s always crying so much, but when she voiced her concerns, my cousin and his wife started locking the door when the woman is there with the baby to prevent my aunt from going there and doing something.\n\nI find these \u201cexercises\u201d absolutely crazy and feel like they shouldn\u2019t be done on a child this young. I\u2019m not a doctor nor a nurse but I\u2019ve always read that people have to be very cautious with newborns\u2019 necks because they can\u2019t support their head. Also, parents should start introducing babies to exercise when they\u2019re about 6 months old, but even then it should just be gentle massaging, gentle stretching and stuff. No crazy flips and turns and fucking somersaults.\n\nMy mum and I decided that we will call my cousin and talk to him. We went the diplomatic way and just said that we found the exercises unsuitable for a two-months-old and that we think they should reconsider. My cousin told us that they\u2019ve attended courses on how to care for newborns and that he and his wife are raising their baby according to science. He also said that the woman is certified and has completed some courses or whatever. He thinks these exercises make the baby healthy and strong and that they boost the baby\u2019s immunity. The call ended with my cousin saying that he will think about what we\u2019re saying but I have a feeling that he was annoyed.\n\nI have to add that it looks like the woman is doing this for a living and she probably has some kind of technique when she's flipping the baby and balancing him (meaning she might have done some courses). But I still think that she shouldn't be doing this to two-months-olds at all.\n\nAITA for criticizing my cousin and his wife for letting that woman do these \u201cexercises\u201d with the baby? I think I want to know whether my concerns (and my mum\u2019s and my aunt\u2019s) are even valid.", "created_utc": 1673005264, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104s3m5/aita_for_criticizing_my_cousins_parenting/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tummy time and helping him practice lifting his head through it I feel is very normal for that age as it will help build neck strength and everything else it helps with, however having him stand or do anything else like the flipping is absolutely not okay. Their muscles aren\u2019t ready to stand or anything like that at 2 months old.

SBS is very real & that baby or any baby really is way too young for that. I'd be scared out my mind that something like that would happen.

Im not 100% sure about the science of it but I think it has to do with the fact that they still have the same reflexes from when they were in the tummyr?
