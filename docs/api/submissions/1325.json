I strongly disagree with everyone saying your mother did nothing wrong and with your attitude that she was just sharing an opinion rather than being directly disrespectful.\n\nYour mother\u2019s remark was rude. If it had been a general discussions about holiday weddings ok fine. But it wasn\u2019t. It was a discussion about YOUR wedding AT your wedding. Saying she wouldn\u2019t have gone if it had been on a holiday is totally combative. It\u2019s hard to believe someone could choose to share that opinion then and there without intending it to be hurtful. And she made it worse by saying what your wife would have done is selfish. In fact if your wording is correct she said \u2018people who do you what you wanted to do are selfish\u2019. She straight up called you both selfish to your face at your wedding and she said trick or treating was more important than your wedding\u2026 at your wedding! Her behaviour was awful. \n\nNow did your wife overreact? Yeah probably. She should have brushed it off and gotten on with things. She shouldn\u2019t have asked you to kick your mother out and I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t.

You should start paying more attention.", "NTA. Your mom's unsolicited opinion aside, your wife sounds like a drama queen. I know quite a few peeps who married on Xmas eve, NYE, and other holidays.

Your wife needs to calm down.", "Nta she didn't say anything rude although bad timing on your mom's part to even mention it but it is what it is.

Weddings aren't usually fun for them anyway.", "NTA but I do not understand why people are angry at your wife. It is very rude of your mother to say she wouldn\u2019t come to your wedding on a \u201choliday\u201d (especially if that holiday is Halloween\u2026 a b-list holiday). Children may get 12-15 halloweens (?!) but you should expect to only see your son get married once. And it doesn\u2019t sound like an offhand remark or joke. I think your wife has reason to be upset. But I also don\u2019t think kicking your mom out of the wedding would be called for (if this was the only issue). Maybe acknowledge to your wife that you agree it was a fucked up thing to say to someone and you are on her side but it would of been too painful to you to not have your mom there. And it all worked out etc.", "ESH.  Your mother horrified half the guests and you did nothing.  Good way to guarantee a very short marriage.  Your mother clearly an anus for talking like that at the wedding.  Wife, a little bit of an anus for the draconian demand, but that's probably because you refused to defend her.  You say you BOTH always wanted a Halloween wedding, and then you caved like wet paper.  What are you going to do when mom makes the next outrageous comment or request?", "ESH. I agree with your mom that holiday weddings are selfish, but there's times to speak your mind and times to bite your tongue. This was a time to bite your tongue. She didn't have to lie.

No one wants to be insulted at their own wedding.", "ESH. \n\nYour mom sucks because she felt the need to make it clear to everyone around that \u201cher children come first\u201d. She didn\u2019t need to bring it up at all, because as she said, it wasn\u2019t an issue. But she did bring it up because her ego needed everyone to know how important her children are to her, and how she\u2019ll never make them sacrifice anything for anyone. Which is probably bull shit, and I\u2019m sure she makes them (and you) sacrifice things for her all the time.\n\nYour wife sucks because she was going to cause major family drama on your wedding day over something that was a small snub and should be dealt with later.\n\nAnd you suck because you are making excuses for your mom\u2019s shit behavior, and your momma\u2019s boy tendencies will probably doom your marriage if you don\u2019t get over them.

But ultimately I don\u2019t give a wad when you marry. If it was more of an acquaintance I\u2019d give them a gift and say sorry I have plans with family out of state.

While Halloween isn't important to me - at all - I do get pissed when I get obligatory event invites that take place during the holidays. \n\nWhile this doesn't apply to OP, I also think weddings that take place on travel holidays are selfish.

OP's wife could have taken that to be MIL saying she was selfish.  And it's strange since Halloween is barely a holiday. It's more of an event. It's not a day off work so people don't make travel plans that a wedding would interfere with. It seems OP has minor-aged siblings who might have gone trick or treating  but a Halloween wedding would be pretty memorable and would probably feature trick or treating or at least bags of candy as wedding favors.

No one is an A H except the MIL.", "Halloween is probably the only holiday I would be ok with attending a wedding.

You and your wife would want to take that joy away from your siblings so you could bogart a Holiday?", "I suppose though, like anything in life, it depends what you personally make of it. I know people who don't do much for Christmas but go nuts at Halloween, I'm personally ambivalent about Halloween, new years, and bonfire night but would likely skip a wedding at Christmas or Easter because we tend to go big then.  Whilst you might not have a set day off for Halloween I know plenty who will book the day off in advance to do stuff. \n\nI think the entire thing has been blown out of proportion.

Not everyone can take time random time off for weddings, but holidays are (usually) paid time off that *everyone* gets.
