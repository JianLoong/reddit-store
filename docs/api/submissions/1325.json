She also wasn\u2019t playing favorites in any conceivable way since she said she\u2019d feel the same for anyone, and because she already missed SiL\u2019s wedding when it took place on a holiday.\n\nI do see her point. I wouldn\u2019t call people who have holiday weddings selfish per say, but I can see why she\u2019d want to preserve Halloween memories for the kids since they don\u2019t have very many growing up. She didn\u2019t say she\u2019d try to make you change your mind if the date did fall on Halloween, she would respect that but just choose not to attend.", "Nta. Your mother was asked a question & she answered. She didnt stand up to make a speech & say thank God the wedding is today because if it had been Monday I wouldnt have come. She didn't go to the NYE wedding, she wouldn't have went to your Halloween wedding. Your wife is making this about her wanting some weird control over a situation that didnt happen & I'm not seeing who your mum was being disrespectful too.", "Actually, I agree with your mother. Holiday weddings (imo) are selfish. She should have kept her mouth shut or not come though...nta", "INFO : Has your mother always enjoyed cultivating controversy and starting fights? You may have to help your wife learn how to shut her MIL\u2019s blather down or at least tune it out.", "NTA. Your mom is right that people who do their weddings on a holiday are selfish and inconsiderate. Yall had the topic come up and mom answered honestly. Maybe not tactful but it is what it is. Your wife was over dramatic in wanting to kick her out. Lord help ya.", "NTA. Your wife is upset with your mother over a hypothetical situation? And she wanted you to kick her out because of it? Your mom is entitled to her own opinion. Didn't sound like she was being rude about it, just stating how she felt. \n\nOk, so she missed her own SIL's wedding because it was on NYE's, that's her prerogative. But people who do schedule weddings on such holidays run the risk of having a poor turn out because it's a holiday.", "NTa\n\n\"If you don't agree with what she said why isn't the wedding on halloween?\"", "Yta ur mother disrespected both of you learn to stand up for your wife", "NTA. \n\nYour mom is right--holiday weddings suck. But more importantly, she's entitled to her opinion. I didn't see anything suggesting that she was rude or disrespectful in expressing that and it's all a moot point as the wedding wasn't on a holiday. Your wife is completely overreacting and needs to calm down.", "NTA, and if this isn\u2019t yet another variation on the standard \u201cwife wants to declare WW3 on MIL to prove she can\u201d prompt, I worry about your marriage.\n\n> it isn't halloween though so it is a nonissue\n\nExactly.  Why is your wife determined to pick a fight over a snub that didn\u2019t happen?

REALLY?? And she wouldn't take that away from anyone?? Your mom is juvenile), then I don't get it. If your mom REALLY thinks taking her teenagers trick or treating on Halloween is more important than going to her child's wedding, she's an idiot. \n\nYour wife shouldn't have responded. It's clear your mom is juvenile and I'm sure many people think it, so why argue about it. Just do what you want and do NOT plan your life around your mom's stupid rules (but I also wouldn't kick my mom out of my wedding because of this). Your wife thinking you should cut your mom off for being ridiculous about her holidays makes me think your wife isn't that great either. \n\nESH except you.", "NTA honestly, what an overreaction.", "ESH, maybe not your wife but you should have said something to your mom. Her having an opinion is fine her expressing that opinion in front of your wife makes her an asshole. Your mom sounds like a pretty not good person so maybe look into that.", "NTA. Does your wife like to start drama where there is none?  Who on earth cares what your mother thinks about something that didn\u2019t happen.", "NTA. Your mom is right about holiday weddings. Yay for the couple if they can get extra days off work for their honeymoon, but it\u2019s often a pain for the guests. Holiday airfares tend to be higher & airports are more crowded. If you drive, weekend holiday traffic can be hellish. Plus the wedding does hijack any other celebration plans you had.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good luck with your wife, buddy. NTA", "nta, i think your wife was overreacting but your mom is a bit of a pill though.", "NTA. \n\nWEDDINGS. It\u2019s always bloody weddings. Your mum was being openly unpleasant - telling a bride on her wedding day that she would have skipped it all for a few fun sized snickers and dress ups.

Idk maybe not, but you could've asked her to save the opinion for a more appropriate time.\n\nInfo: It sounds like your mom is like this, and maybe your wife was already on edge waiting for her to do something.

You're in for a real ride..", "INFO: What was your wife's relationship with her MIL like prior to this?", "NTA. You are right your mother was explaining her opinion in a hypothetical situation.  Not saying that she didn't have a little snark to her tone, but your wife is getting upset over nothing. You all didn't have your wedding on a holiday, so it's a non issue.", "NTA - why would your wife want to kick your mom out over a \"didn't happen\" situation - mom said she would skip a wedding (I'm assuming ANY wedding) if it was on a holiday - so what!   I think your wife is not only disrespecting your mother, but attempting to drive some wedge between families (or maybe just you).  I mean the whole thing was just a conversation about mom's priorities - wife doesn't have to agree, but damn...kick her out over it?  Totally weird.", "LMAO you are NTA, but your wife and your mom are both egotistical and sound like pain in the asses. Good luck my friend.", "NTA \n\nSo your wife was upset over a hypothetical wedding date and wanted to kick your mom out because of something that can't even happen? She was offended because you might have picked Halloween, but didn't? I can't even grasp the petty here. \n\nI wonder if your wife is planning future children in her head and thinking about if they are born on a holiday and your mother won't come to their hypothetical birthdays, too? \n\nThis is all too stupid to wrap my head around.", "Nta.\n\nWhat is the issue here. Your mom has an opinion about weddings on holidays, which a lot of people might agree with frankly. But the actual wedding *wasn't* on Halloween though? I feel like it's an overreaction to ask her to leave over that comment.", "ESH.   \n\n\nYour mom didn't have to advertise her hatred of weddings that happen on holidays, and your wife and her family being \"horrified\" by that and asking MIL to leave is ridiculous.   \n\n\nSounds like you married someone who's a lot like your mom, so good luck!", " NTA and I actually agree with your mom, even though I went into this expecting otherwise. Couples can do what they want for their wedding, but I can think they suck for taking a holiday away from their guests. \n\nThat being said, I\u2019d still go and wouldn\u2019t say anything if it was someone close to me, but I *did* turn down a Halloween wedding last year for a couple I barely know. \n\nIt was extremely overkill of your wife to ask you to kick your mother out of the wedding. That\u2019s absurd.

It was kind of a \"what did you expect\" situation. Most people are away visiting friends and family or are traveling home Saturday so they have Sunday to relax and prepare for the coming week.", "I don't think so as she walks away from these fights and refuses to engage, but she is very hyper focused when she wants something (like my sisters to go trick or treating) and no amount of logic, arguing,emotion is going to stop her when she thinks she is right. Her husband and MIL tried to bribe her to go to that NYE wedding but nothing was going to make her", "His wife can stand up for herself thank you very much.", "I'm sorry for saying I wouldn't attend your hypothetical wedding while attending your actual wedding.", "The mom was in attendance. The mom said she would NOT have gone IF it had been on Halloween.", "She never said she wouldn't as it wasn't on the actual holiday. If we had the wedding on Halloween I don't think she would have come", "Awkward and non existent for the most part. they clearly don't like each other and avoid being around each other, but if called out they both claim it is fine or it doesn't matter. They occasionally take digs at each other and I shut that down, but for the most part it is hard to get them to speak", "Yeah, I feel that. Perhaps the only socially acceptable holiday to schedule a wedding on would be Valentine\u2019s Day, since it fits the theme well-enough. I suppose it definitely can be seen as self-centered, since you\u2019re essentially high-jacking the holiday to put yourself at the center.

It's also going to be midweek and the day before my birthday. \n\nDo you know what I said when I found out the date? I asked if I could wear a T Rex costume because I love Halloween.", "I LOVE long weekend weddings if I have to travel. It\u2019s stressful to go out on a Saturday morning for an evening wedding and be back Sunday. I get no downtime. Having a Sunday wedding when Monday is a holiday is my preference. \n\nFriday/Saturday after Thanksgiving only works for a hometown wedding. But it\u2019s great for someone who is close to high school friends who will be home anyway to see their families.", "My cousins (sisters) had a double wedding on Halloween. Everyone came in costume. The brides and grooms walked down the isle to Riders on the Storm with smoke machines - best wedding ever!", "I would go to a wedding on any holiday if the guests were wearing T Rex costumes"]}
