Her regular hair is brown and has grown a lot so she has two tone hair now *ontop* of what's faded.

I know she used to care a lot about her hair so idk when or why she got apathetic about it as she does keep up other personal care habits like getting her nails done monthly and getting new tattoos.\n\nThe issue is since dropping out of school this last semester she's been looking for work and a few of the ideas she has had are working in makeup stores (? \\*only question cause Idk if thats what they're officially called) to be a floor artist (?). She's selt taught but has wanted to go into makeup for a while. She has an interview next week and has been asking about what to wear.. I gave her my input (business casual black clothing) and did comment on her hair at the time that she may want to either go back to her regular color or go get a haircut or new dye job to show off her style.

She's seeking employment in an industry that DOES care about her appearance because it is a reflection of the company.  I don't see it as misogynistic or attempting to change her.

IDK what your delivery or your exact words were but I can see how it would be misconstrued depending on that.", "NTA Looking \u201cneglected\u201d is never good for job interviews, especially one as appearance based, as \u201csuperficial\u201d as cosmetic sales. \n\nShe sounds depressed or in denial or something. Hair care with fancy colors requires a lot of expensive and time consuming upkeep, and it is ultimately damaging to the hair. She may be in denial. She may be unsure of what to do and is just stuck. But what she *shouldn\u2019t* do is go look for a job where appearance is a big important deal.", "NTA If you said it exactly like this, but apparently she misunderstood, maybe trying explaining to her again that it doesn't matter what color it is, she's beautiful anyway, but would be nice for her to do the hair maintenance before the interview,  be clear you're only talking about the maintenance not colors", "NTA  In that work atmosphere you are correct, she will be judged and probably won't get the jobs.", "NTA\n\nYou were answering about how she'd be perceived in a **work** interview.  In particular in an interview where the specifics of her appearance are extremely important.\n\nYou were not bringing it up for any other reason.\n\nShe and her flying monkeys are being the AH here, because they all leapt to the assumption you're a controlling AH in general, from a question **she asked**.  In a context where it absolutely would matter.\n\nAppearance matters a lot in interviews anyways.  I imagine it's a lot more true in interviews for a makeup position.", "NTA.\n\nI applied for a job at Ulta, minimum wage, and they ended the interview by telling me that if hired, I would need to get my roots done and color evened out. \n\nA makeup store can, and will, demand a full face of makeup and up-kept hair. They allow bright/crazy colors but require you to upkeep it. \n\nThis is no different than telling her she needs some black pants or non-slip shoes to work at McDonalds.\n\nThat said: as someone who also has bright, multicolored hair?

She\u2019s neglecting her hair, dropped out of school, doesn\u2019t know what to do, and she *feels* like you criticized her appearance.\n\nI don\u2019t like that she both jumped on you immediately, and then called her friends to give you the cold shoulder.\n\nNormally in a case like this I usually recommend a peace apology, but if she\u2019s this unforgiving and immediately shit-talks you, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the best idea.", "NTA for suggesting it.

Is she depressed or overwhelmed?", "I have dyed hair and I always get it professionally refreshed before important things, especially interviews. Funky colored hair can go from \"neat\" to \"yikes\" so quickly, and whether we want it or not, people will judge us and now much they can trust our judgment based on things like our hair.

I was wrong.\n\nNTA - you're right.  The beauty industry requires its front-facing employees to represent the brands and damaged, unkempt, neglected hair is not in line with that.  Perhaps she can keep it pinned up or something, but ultimately she'll need to address it.   That said, it's going to take her a while to see this from your perspective.", "You were kind of trying to save her from embarrassment. People in the makeup industry will be specifically looking at skills along with presentation.

It sounds as though she\u2019s twisting your comments with a huge defence. I think you seriously need to take a look at your girlfriend and check in that she is actually ok. The hair, the dropping out of school, the defence when you noticed, screams that she\u2019s having a tough time. \n\nYou know her better than we do, but she\u2019s clearly got her defences up so instead of writing it on Reddit to justify it to yourself and prove a point just try to communicate or even lightly apologise for the way it\u2019s come across and ask if you can help her in any way with any of it, her hair, outfits again, interview techniques etc. swallow your pride and tell her she will be incredible. She\u2019s probably really nervous and projected it onto you!", "NAH\n\nYou are fine with her hair however she is, but said it in a way that came out wrong.

Although it does seem like you're coming from a genuine place of concern for your girlfriend, I can see how your words would be hurtful, and the intention of our words doesn't always matter so much as the impact they have. \n\nInstead of being concerned about what her hair looks like, maybe try to get to the bottom of why she's been \"neglecting\" her hair.

You just told her to take care of her hair for the interview. Sounds like she needs a deep conditioning treatment for a start and at the very least a trim. You can get hair mask stuff from a regular grocery store. Something like Arvazalia hair mask. That will take care of the frizz.", "NTA - she asked OP answered. For a job interview looking presentable is important and your hair is an aspect of one\u2019s appearance. Also having some messed up looking hair could easily sink her job interview for the cosmetology industry.\n\nI know a girl who worked at Sephora. She was kinda plain and pudgy. She always had great makeup and hair though. Every time I saw this girl, she had makeup and hair done up in some manner that showed a lot of time and care taken.", "NTA. Her interviewer is going to take a look at her and see someone who got bored and disinterested in appearance.

It\u2019s not often that I read the title, think it\u2019s going to be one thing but it turns out to be completely different.\n\nYou weren\u2019t suggesting changing her hair purely based on your preferences, but you were responding to her asking for suggestions which makes this completely different, and you are right, if that\u2019s an industry she wants to get into, there are expectations surrounding grooming and presentation that her current hair condition won\u2019t meet. If her hair is as damaged as it looks, she\u2019s probably better off getting a cut rather than continuing to colour it though.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s like someone in the fitness industry that stops taking care of their body.

Her hair is currently unprofessional for the job that she wants. You're within your rights to point that out, especially when she asked. It's going to be unhealthy whether or not the dye job is kept up with--that's just kind of the nature of bleaching/dyeing your hair--and the color doesn't make it dirty. I'd snap back at you for that too.", "NTA. Fix her hair long enough to get a job. After you're hired some places will let it slide. First impressions.", "NTA but it sounds like she's maybe trying to grow it out to be her natural hair color? It sucks but you either leave it and let it look like garbage until it's long enough to cut the dyed part off and still have a good hair length, you cut the dyed part off and it's too short, or you dye it as closely to your natural color as you can so it's less ugly while it grows out.", "NTA.  \nYou're 100% correct. Any job in the beauty industry is going to look at an employee as a reflection of themselves.  \nThe fact that she had to badger the answer out of you is proof that your intentions were good.", "Meh. Small YTA for giving her unsolicited advice\u2014 she asked about her clothes. Not her hair. \n\nTo be frank, they probably care more about her makeup than her hair\u2014 we all have bad hair days/weeks/months. I\u2019m not sure if men who don\u2019t care about their hair and/or have long hair will get it, but sometimes it\u2019s just going to not be up to par and you\u2019re not going to do anything with it, because it is EXHAUSTING (and expensive) trying to keep up with it. Nails require 1-2 hours every few weeks, hair requires a couple of hours every day. Also, she\u2019s probably trying to grow it out. Dying it so often is not healthy, so I would bet that she\u2019s trying to reset everything before doing anything new. If this is what she\u2019s doing, then she\u2019s probably feeling insecure about her hair right now, and you, by giving the unsolicited advice, made her feel worse about it. \n\nI honestly doubt this company would care all that much about her hair as long as everything else is on point, because a lot of people go through phases like that. \n\nAnd small YTA to your girlfriend for calling you misogynistic. Just because you don\u2019t understand doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re being misogynistic.", "I mean you are right, but her hair probably needs a break from dye so it can get healthier, it might not be able to handle more dye at the moment.\n\n\nso while you thought you were suggesting a quick fix in line with what she normally does, you\u2019ve just pointed out something she CANT fix and will now feel even more self conscious about it.\n\nStart working on your apology. Especially since you straight up told her it looks dirty come on man \n\nAnd no I don\u2019t think it was misogynistic it wasn\u2019t about your preferences but the standards of a makeup store which I agree they want their employees to look polished (which is way better than saying you look dirty btw) but it\u2019s not what she asked and the opposite of what she needed to hear. \n\nYTA", "YTA. She probably needs to grow out her hair, to restore it's health which is really common for people with extensive hair damage to do, or the cost of maintenance was getting to be too much for the rainbow hair. She can slick her hair back and tie it for interviews and work, and quite honestly, I can't imagine she doesn't know how to present herself for a beauty industry job interview since she is already style/beauty proficient. So either you think she doesn't know how to handle herself or you actually do have a problem with her non-work related appearance.", "YTA - I think saying her hair looked dirty was a smidge too far, your delivery probably could've been softer. If she doesn't have a job she might not be able to afford to get it done again - hair color like that runs hundreds of dollars. I get that what you said came from a place of care, but the words you used are tough.", "Personally yeah it doesn't matter to me.

If they were i would offer her some if it helped her feel more confident. \n\nI worry for her mainly cause i know the industry can be cruel and while it doesnt truly matter to me, it matters to them. I didnt know what to say. \"Be yourself\" doesnt exactly work in that line of work when there are standards to 'being yourself'.", "Right. Like could be neon green, black, orange, I don't care. I just think it needs something to make it refreshed and look taken care of regardless of color or style", "She is bipolar and does have treatment for it and sees a therapist. Only this past year shes been neglecting her hair and the hair is the only thing she has neglected. Maybe could be she wants to grow it out to get healthy again or stop dyeing it, idk.

It sucks to be reminded of the stuff that you know you need to fix but can\u2019t bring yourself to. It would explain her over the top reaction.", "I dont think its a money thing since she gets $ from her dad and just spent $500+ on a thigh piece tattoo a few weeks ago. Shes always had mental health issues but the hair has been the only thing that has been neglected otherwise.", "I responded to a few other comments. She has $. She just spent $500 on a tattoo last month unless I'm vastly underestimating how much it would be to fix her hair", "we go to the grocers in our PJs most the time, I dont care how she looks but I dont want her to be upset if she doesnt get the job or isnt taken seriously by an industry she loves because of the neglect.", "If she hasn't kept up with it for at least a year.  I doubt it's a major dye issue.  As long as he commented about it and didn't tell her, a suggestion is not bad.", "Does she have the money to get her hair fixed? I'm in the US and getting your hair colored at a better (trustworthy, well-trained) salon isn't cheap. Since she was likely bleaching her hair, there is a chance it is damaged and may need some treatments done (also not cheap). \n\nIn fact, it's possible the reason she stopped doing her hair is because of the damage. \n\nDid she do her hair herself or did she go somewhere? This seems to be a minefield for you right now, but if she went somewhere you can consider buying a gift certificate for her. Again -- this might be the wrong move, but if money is the issue it could help. \n\nAnd NTA.", "This was my first thought, that she\u2019s growing it out because it\u2019s probably very damaged from all the coloring. I color my hair a lot, too, so I\u2019ve been there and it does look not so great while you go through that process, unfortunately. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s well known that appearances matter in the beauty industry, and you were legitimately trying to help, so her reaction is quite bizarre imo. \n\nIdk. I am always very aware when my hair be looking funky and it doesn\u2019t offend me if someone points out the obvious. Perhaps she is just feeling insecure about it.", "As someone who colours her hair a lot, this was my first thought, that she's just growing it out cause she realises it's unhealthy or maybe she wants to go back to her natural hair color (and bleaching it again would only damage it further).\n\nI'm also going through that phase of growing it out and sadly it just doesn't look very good when you're going through it. I think you should have another chat with her and find if that's the reason and just give her some reassurance you don't personally care, it's just about the industry standards.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019ve been doing my own hair at home since I was 12. I get a box of my color at the grocery store for $10 and that\u2019s it. However, swampy colors are hard to get out of hair and often ruin the color you put on top of it. You can buy non-bleach color remover from the beauty store for probably around $10 as well. A home makeover with a little patience can easily be done under $30. You mentioned earlier that she struggles with mental health, and sometimes daunting 3-4 hour tasks can be put off for months because of the anxiety and uncertainty that builds up around them. Sometimes when I\u2019m down, I become irrationally afraid of little changes like wearing different clothes. I\u2019m not sure what the situation is, but I hope she gets the job nice hair or not :)", "[deleted]", "adjectives = judgment.\n\nright. got it dude."]}
