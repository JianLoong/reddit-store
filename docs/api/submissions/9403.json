In particular in an interview where the specifics of her appearance are extremely important.\n\nYou were not bringing it up for any other reason.\n\nShe and her flying monkeys are being the AH here, because they all leapt to the assumption you're a controlling AH in general, from a question **she asked**.

You just told her to take care of her hair for the interview. Sounds like she needs a deep conditioning treatment for a start and at the very least a trim. You can get hair mask stuff from a regular grocery store. Something like Arvazalia hair mask. That will take care of the frizz.", "NTA - she asked OP answered. For a job interview looking presentable is important and your hair is an aspect of one\u2019s appearance. Also having some messed up looking hair could easily sink her job interview for the cosmetology industry.\n\nI know a girl who worked at Sephora. She was kinda plain and pudgy.

If her hair is as damaged as it looks, she\u2019s probably better off getting a cut rather than continuing to colour it though.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s like someone in the fitness industry that stops taking care of their body.

Her hair is currently unprofessional for the job that she wants. You're within your rights to point that out, especially when she asked. It's going to be unhealthy whether or not the dye job is kept up with--that's just kind of the nature of bleaching/dyeing your hair--and the color doesn't make it dirty. I'd snap back at you for that too.", "NTA. Fix her hair long enough to get a job. After you're hired some places will let it slide. First impressions.", "NTA but it sounds like she's maybe trying to grow it out to be her natural hair color? It sucks but you either leave it and let it look like garbage until it's long enough to cut the dyed part off and still have a good hair length, you cut the dyed part off and it's too short, or you dye it as closely to your natural color as you can so it's less ugly while it grows out.", "NTA.  \nYou're 100% correct. Any job in the beauty industry is going to look at an employee as a reflection of themselves.  \nThe fact that she had to badger the answer out of you is proof that your intentions were good.", "Meh. Small YTA for giving her unsolicited advice\u2014 she asked about her clothes. Not her hair. \n\nTo be frank, they probably care more about her makeup than her hair\u2014 we all have bad hair days/weeks/months. I\u2019m not sure if men who don\u2019t care about their hair and/or have long hair will get it, but sometimes it\u2019s just going to not be up to par and you\u2019re not going to do anything with it, because it is EXHAUSTING (and expensive) trying to keep up with it. Nails require 1-2 hours every few weeks, hair requires a couple of hours every day. Also, she\u2019s probably trying to grow it out. Dying it so often is not healthy, so I would bet that she\u2019s trying to reset everything before doing anything new. If this is what she\u2019s doing, then she\u2019s probably feeling insecure about her hair right now, and you, by giving the unsolicited advice, made her feel worse about it. \n\nI honestly doubt this company would care all that much about her hair as long as everything else is on point, because a lot of people go through phases like that. \n\nAnd small YTA to your girlfriend for calling you misogynistic.

Especially since you straight up told her it looks dirty come on man \n\nAnd no I don\u2019t think it was misogynistic it wasn\u2019t about your preferences but the standards of a makeup store which I agree they want their employees to look polished (which is way better than saying you look dirty btw) but it\u2019s not what she asked and the opposite of what she needed to hear. \n\nYTA", "YTA. She probably needs to grow out her hair, to restore it's health which is really common for people with extensive hair damage to do, or the cost of maintenance was getting to be too much for the rainbow hair. She can slick her hair back and tie it for interviews and work, and quite honestly, I can't imagine she doesn't know how to present herself for a beauty industry job interview since she is already style/beauty proficient. So either you think she doesn't know how to handle herself or you actually do have a problem with her non-work related appearance.", "YTA - I think saying her hair looked dirty was a smidge too far, your delivery probably could've been softer.

If they were i would offer her some if it helped her feel more confident. \n\nI worry for her mainly cause i know the industry can be cruel and while it doesnt truly matter to me, it matters to them. I didnt know what to say. \"Be yourself\" doesnt exactly work in that line of work when there are standards to 'being yourself'.", "Right. Like could be neon green, black, orange, I don't care. I just think it needs something to make it refreshed and look taken care of regardless of color or style", "She is bipolar and does have treatment for it and sees a therapist.

It would explain her over the top reaction.", "I dont think its a money thing since she gets $ from her dad and just spent $500+ on a thigh piece tattoo a few weeks ago. Shes always had mental health issues but the hair has been the only thing that has been neglected otherwise.", "I responded to a few other comments. She has $. She just spent $500 on a tattoo last month unless I'm vastly underestimating how much it would be to fix her hair", "we go to the grocers in our PJs most the time, I dont care how she looks but I dont want her to be upset if she doesnt get the job or isnt taken seriously by an industry she loves because of the neglect.", "If she hasn't kept up with it for at least a year.

I'm in the US and getting your hair colored at a better (trustworthy, well-trained) salon isn't cheap. Since she was likely bleaching her hair, there is a chance it is damaged and may need some treatments done (also not cheap). \n\nIn fact, it's possible the reason she stopped doing her hair is because of the damage. \n\nDid she do her hair herself or did she go somewhere? This seems to be a minefield for you right now, but if she went somewhere you can consider buying a gift certificate for her. Again -- this might be the wrong move, but if money is the issue it could help. \n\nAnd NTA.", "This was my first thought, that she\u2019s growing it out because it\u2019s probably very damaged from all the coloring. I color my hair a lot, too, so I\u2019ve been there and it does look not so great while you go through that process, unfortunately. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s well known that appearances matter in the beauty industry, and you were legitimately trying to help, so her reaction is quite bizarre imo. \n\nIdk. I am always very aware when my hair be looking funky and it doesn\u2019t offend me if someone points out the obvious. Perhaps she is just feeling insecure about it.", "As someone who colours her hair a lot, this was my first thought, that she's just growing it out cause she realises it's unhealthy or maybe she wants to go back to her natural hair color (and bleaching it again would only damage it further).\n\nI'm also going through that phase of growing it out and sadly it just doesn't look very good when you're going through it.

I get a box of my color at the grocery store for $10 and that\u2019s it. However, swampy colors are hard to get out of hair and often ruin the color you put on top of it. You can buy non-bleach color remover from the beauty store for probably around $10 as well. A home makeover with a little patience can easily be done under $30. You mentioned earlier that she struggles with mental health, and sometimes daunting 3-4 hour tasks can be put off for months because of the anxiety and uncertainty that builds up around them. Sometimes when I\u2019m down, I become irrationally afraid of little changes like wearing different clothes.

You spoke up about this out of concern for her. You sound like an empathetic and kind partner. She obviously values your opinion about how she should dress for the interview, so I\u2019m guessing she reacted the way she did to your input about her hair because it rang true to her but she\u2019s feeling overwhelmed and unsure what to do to with her hair. You mentioned that you don\u2019t think money is the issue but maybe it\u2019s part of the issue? Perhaps offering to treat her to a refresh appointment with her hairstylist (sounds like she\u2019ll need a hair cut and color) would show her that you\u2019re just trying to be supportive? Especially if you were to mention that the color and style of her hair is 100% up to her.", "NTA...\n\nI always beg my significant others to be brutally honest with me and hold me accountable for things like that.

Her hair needs to look nice for this industry. But her hair sounds SUPER damaged. Their honestly might not be much she can do at this point, and that very well might be why she reacted this way.

I color my hair a lot, keep up with the colors, and try to not let it go too long between even if the colors haven't faded so much. But the first sign of me not being well is when I stop taking care of my hair, when I neglect one of the things I take a lot of pride in.", "NTA. Beauty industry, or any job in going to notice hair that is not kept up. If she isn't going to color any longer, she really should cut it. Regardless, she sounds like it needs a cut. It was definitely fair to mention it at the very least.", "NTA - Not many people would be willing to pay someone to make them look good when the person themselves aren't taking care of their own appearance.", "Is neglecting her hair something new?  Could she be depressed?  Is she neglecting anything else that used to be important or make her happy?", "NTA, if she's going for a job telling others how to look great, having dry dead, badly grown out roots won't do her ANY favors!", "Is she growing it out back to her natural color? You can't just dye hair back to your natural color when it's been that damaged by dyes over the years. And all she has to say to a potential boss is \"I know my hair is funky; I'm growing it back to my natural color,\" and anyone worth their salt will know that this is the way to go. Sure, she can cut dead ends more often, but the gross colors will stay there until she cuts them, and if she doesn't want to have short hair, then y'all will just have to wait.\n\nIt's odd that you keep saying you \"truly don't care,\" yet you just wrote five paragraphs talking about how this is a problem for you.

Is she having family problems? Money problems? Is it possible she's depressed? Is she going through a grunge phase? Is she having a quarter-life crisis? \n\nI don't think you're an asshole for what you told her. You seem to have addressed the issue as professionally as possible, and you're right that she's going to be judged for her appearance if she's working in the beauty industry. \n\nUltimately though, it just seems weird that someone who was previously so careful with their hair has neglected it for a year and (a) can't tell that it looks bad, and (b) gets mad when someone else tells them it looks bad, unless it's making her desperately sad or embarrassed or something. You might want to do a little more gentle probing and a lot more listening to make sure there isn't something else going on here: How does she feel about her hair right now, and does it make her happy the way it is? Is there anything you can do to help?", "I worked at Ulta for four months and on Day 1 I had to watch a training video saying I was required to wear makeup \u2014 including eye makeup, as they specifically mentioned several times \u2014 every shift.

I didn't know it was not color safe, stripped the beautiful purple right out of my hair in a few washes.", "You could always do what I did accidently. I used Bumble and Bumble Thickening shampoo and conditioner without realizing they weren't color safe.  My hair, after a few washes, went from a dark purple down to my usual medium brown. My hair felt amazing.", "NTA. She's depressed.", "NTA. A job around selling beauty/fashion is definitely going to judge her based on appearance and will have requirements around an employee's \"look\". There's nothing wrong with pointing that out.\n\nThere's no way she's not aware that she's been neglecting her hair maintenance, especially if she used to change it frequently. It's possible she reacted so strongly because she's ashamed she let it get in such a state.", "NTA", "I was really prepared to vote Y T A for about half this post, but it sounds like you basically just suggested it as part of getting ready to interview for jobs which is not unreasonable and then she kept pushing you to talk about it more.\n\nI do wonder just based on her stopping taking care of something she used to spend a lot of time on combined with dropping out of school whether she might be depressed? Not that that has to be the case, there are obviously tons of reasons people drop out of school and maybe she simply decided she would rather spend time on things other than her hair but I just wanted to flag that I guess.", "NTA - It sounds like you were trying to offer her some good advice in a positive and encouraging way trying to help her prepare for her interview, and you're definitely right that her appearance will be judged at this interview, unfair as that is. However, she interpreted your comments as criticism and control, and despite this being a misunderstanding it can grow into a more serious conflict if not resolved sensitively. \n\nIt's very important now to get with her and have a very open and honest conversation, starting with you offering an apology for how your comments came across and going into a broader but short explanation of your meaning and intent. Calmly express your concern that her hair will be judged by the interviewers to be unhealthy or unkempt in appearance and that you believe that having a fresh and polished appearance could help her stand out in this a traditionally very judgmental field. Listen to how she feels about it though and respect her personal choices and acknowledge that her appearance is ultimately her decision and assure her you love how she looks no matter what and the only reason you ever brought this up was to try to help with the interview.", "I was ready to be mad but after reading your post I'm gonna say NTA.

Is there separate rules, or do they just assume that men won't apply and thus it's a non-issue to address?", "If she's been getting new tattoos recently and her nails done regularly it doesn't sound like it's an issue of not having the money to get it done, and if it was an issue of damaged hair she could just dye her hair back to her natural colour and get cheaper hair masks without going to a salon for hair repair treatments", "Not an ultra employee, but my (guy) friend was a few years back and he had to wear a full face of makeup for each shift!", "I\u2019ve never seen a guy at Ulta but I have seen them at Sephora, and they wear makeup too.

Well, at least they don't discriminate- everyone's gotta do it!", "I don\u2019t think companies should be able to require makeup or hair products, or at least give it to employees for free if it is a requirement, but if they\u2019re going to require makeup, it bothers me way less when it\u2019s a standard request", "Technically I agree with you! But I see why it's mandatory, considering what they're trying to sell/the image they are trying to put out there. Now, giving it to employees for free? That IS genuinely how it should be! After all, wouldn't it even be a better sales technique? If someone asks about an employee's look, they can guide the customer directly to the products they're selling that were used to create it! And that's all besides the fact that it's kinda shitty (imo) to make employees pay for stuff that they're required to wear every day on the job.", "I also think places like Ulta attract a certain kind of person who likes buying and wearing makeup. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t do except for certain occasions, but they likely wouldn\u2019t hire me anyways. They want people who love to wear makeup and look incredible every single day in their makeup.

You might want to check.", "This was my take too.", "Personally I think you did great telling her.

Beauty industries (from what ive seen and heard) usually want their employees to look their very best. And from someone who's dyed my hair and have several friends that have too, i can imagine the mess on her head right now. I think re-dyeing it to a natural colour or something new would be good, if she's looking for a new job. Like i said, ESPECIALLY in the beauty industry...\n\nI can understand her feeling upset over the comment but also you didn't say it like \"god you look ugly, fix it\". It was gentle advice based on the situation at hand", "This might sound weird but if she has coloured / treated her hair to the point that you say it looks like it might break off then maybe she\u2019s worried about that herself and is leaving it because she is scared of losing her hair altogether.

Why would you have the energy to see a nailartist but not a hairdresser?\n\nI think she is trying to get them healthy again. It soundslike all the dying and especially bleaching damaged her hair really bad and she wants to outgrow the damaged part. \n\nI had to do this too, thanks god i didn't had different colors in it only a bleeching incident, but since i was used to long hair i didn't cut it short but waited till the damage part was outgrown. Oc i kept my hair in a bun all the time and there was no really noticable color difference so i can understand op, if she wears it open it will not look good. Damaged hair is nothing nice to look at and i would have never wear them in a way the damage was obvious.

If she's interested in a beauty industry job, she should get her hair filled and coloured to match her natural.\n\nAs a fashion color addicted though I know that's a hard decision to make, since it's going to end up more damaged if she wants to go back to something light.  So my other advice if she's serious about a job is picking her \"default\" color and going to that.  (mine is green this year) \n\nUnfortunately, they're demanding in regards to looks.
