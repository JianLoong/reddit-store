So, the trees offer privacy and *some* shade not some shade and some privacy.

I would hang out in that tree forever waiting to see them naked again.", "No you're not, It was probably her husband.", "also and 11 year old boy (or any boy 11 and up) aren\u2019t going to tell their parents. They want to be able to watch as much as possible. My guess is either the husband got caught watching or the wife saw and blew a gasket", "Yes, 11 is old enough to mind his own business. Not OPs fault he wasn\u2019t raised right.", "If I saw people running around naked when I was that age I absolutely would have turned away. Didn't want to see that stuff, lol.", "If you don't like what you see, don't look. Their backyard is their private space. It is much easier to look out a different window or not look at all, then for people to not enjoy their backyard.", "You're allowed to look out of your home windows, the general rule in most places that I've heard is that you have to take measures to cover up others don't have to take measure not to see.", "Lol it\u2019s an 11 year old who was probably in his own bedroom, you made him sound like a predator", "It's a good teaching moment for mom to be like \"this is why we don't peer into other people's yards.\"", "I 100% agree with your take. I\u2019ve always had upstairs bedrooms, and in some cases could see into neighbors yards from my bed. Thats no one\u2019s fault, but people are acting like this kid was prowling around to spy on OP, and that is ridiculous to me", "Sure, I think that logic definitely applies well to adults. I don\u2019t really blame an 11 year old for asking his parents what was happening, though. We don\u2019t really know that they were rude about it when they brought it to OP - at least, that\u2019s not how I read it given that they said it wasn\u2019t a huge argument. If I were the parent, I\u2019d probably mention to my neighbor that my kid saw them, too, at least as an fyi like hey, it\u2019s visible.", "Here's her comment about having a fence: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wpk0w/aita_for_going_skinny_dipping_in_my_own_backyard/jhgvnf9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wpk0w/aita_for_going_skinny_dipping_in_my_own_backyard/jhgvnf9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "Why would she need a fence when she has a freaking wall! Lmao", "OP were the pool lights on? I\u2019m not really understanding your point about being private from the street. It sounds like there are other houses around you, with at least 2 stories, so by nature that\u2019s not very private. I don\u2019t really think anyone\u2019s the AH here, but I do think now you know you can be seen you should turn off the pool lights. Some of the responses here make it sound like this 11 year old kid was intentionally prowling around his upstairs looking for a window with a view into your yard\u2026 but I think it\u2019s probable that it was his bedroom window. If your 11 year old could see a neighbor naked in their backyard from their bedroom that wouldn\u2019t bother you?  I can\u2019t really blame the parent for speaking up.", "If you were in public, yes, but if you\u2019re in your own private backyard and your own private pool that is surrounded by 6 foot fence, generally no! Being naked is not inherently sexual so you can be naked in your OWN private area no problems! And if we go back to the indecent exposure argument, for the law sake, there is no where that it states that the child was known to be looking over a 6 foot privacy fence. And then if the child glanced and seen something in the pool, then he should\u2019ve turned around and not been staring long enough to see that they were naked. I don\u2019t understand why people can\u2019t seem to understand that at a glance most people do not notice if you have a swimsuit on, so this child watch for an extended amount of time to see that they were naked in their own private yard.", "I never made him sound like a predator. I pointed out information that was possibly being overlooked by many people! \nAlso, everybody keeps assuming that this was his bedroom window, but if this was his window, I\u2019m pretty sure he would have known not to be looking at the people in the pool so this by assumption is not a typical place This child is in. I don\u2019t know about you, but as a child, I was taught that you don\u2019t look into other peoples personal property and especially if this child has had this bedroom window for a while ( since everybody thinks that it is his bedroom window) I\u2019m pretty sure the parents had that discussion of keep your nose out of the neighbors business.", "We actually don't know that for certain. OP said she was assuming that's how he saw. But still, if they weren't doing anything that was overtly sexual or anything that showed they were aware the kid was watching them, they're NTAs", "Hey, if OP isn't violating any public indecency laws and wants to be naked in her yard to provide a free peep show for the pre-teen neighbor, that's her business I guess.", "Its not my fault she took 3 hours to answer any info questions lol. I posted that 2 hours ago.\n\nThe fence is really irrelevant anyway as she also confirmed the boy could see into her very well lit backyard from an upstairs window.", "Omg she has a sheet rock fence?", "Are you new here?", "You. An have a fence that provides zero privacy.", "Maybe add some [sun shades](https://shadesails.com) about where the window(s) would have a view. If there are problems after that then you have a voyeur and it\u2019s likely the husband not the 11 year old scapegoat", "Is it really that huge of a stretch to you that a kid looked out his bedroom window? You\u2019re acting like it\u2019s unrealistic that someone looked out their own home windows, I don\u2019t get it. Not like it\u2019s a strenuous or unusual activity, I do it every night too. I like to see the moon.", "If she can see their windows, then they can see her from those windows which does technically make her visible from off her property.", "Thing is if they can look out of their home windows and see it is easily arguable that you have no reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nA 6\" privacy fence is insufficient to provide privacy in that context, even if it not a child, anybody living in that house can see which still makes it exposure.\n\nDifferent people have different levels of visual acuity, you might not see much in a glance, but other people can, thing is, they don't have to turn away from their windows or close them or put blinds up, you have to erect adequate privacy barriers.\n\nMy vote is NTA because morally I don't see any problem with even public nudity, but legally it could be OP's fault for insufficient measures to ensure privacy because like I said, a 6\" privacy fence is insufficient top provide privacy in this context.\n\nThey have the right to look out of their home windows freely and if that lets them see into your backyard then your backyard is not a completely private space.\n\nThere are reasons people move to rural locations for privacy.", "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. I figured she might have made her comment after your comment and was just trying to be helpful.", "I never said that it was unrealistic that someone looked up their window. I said that it is unusual/odd that when a child at 10pm noticed somebody in their pool, in their yard, in their own privacy fence, that the child decided to stay long enough to notice that the people were naked. I assume if you looked out your window and if/when you noticed somebody in the privacy of the pool that you would be a decent enough human being to close your blinds or look away.", "Where does it say she can see their windows? \nI didn\u2019t see that mentioned at all!", "Also, there is nothing that it states that the OP was aware that this window specifically looked over her pool but ( as explained by the mother of the child )This child had to go to a specific room in the house to be able to see above the 6 foot fence. It is specified in the comment that I mentioned earlier. \n\nIt is on nobody to make anybody else feel better or appropriate. This child who was looking out the window at 10 PM at night into their neighbors yard. The 11 year old is the problem here, not the people who were in the privacy of their own home/area. A privacy was put in place a 6 foot fence and trees that the child had to go to specific room to be able to see into the pool! A common sense and/or decency would have been if you seen somebody in their pool to not keep looking.", "There's no offense given lol, this is reddit, nothing actually matters here", "I don\u2019t think anyone here alleged that the kid looked longer than was necessary to realize something private was happening? The kid sees what happens, mentions it to parents, like why is there an assumption that he purposefully spied on them? He could\u2019ve seen them, closed the blinds, and then told his parents. And why is the timing of this strange? I was certainly up until 10 at that age.", "It doesn't have to be explicitly mentioned, if he can see them from those windows then logically, she can see those windows.", ">Also, there is nothing that it states that the OP was aware that this window specifically looked over her pool\n\nPerhaps, but if you are ever in the pool and look around you would see that window which does mean either she never observed her surroundings from the pool or just didn't care.\n\nCould be argued as wilful ignorance or negligence.\n\n>This child had to go to a specific room in the house to be able to see above the 6 foot fence.\n\nDoesn't really matter, he is free to look out of any window in his house.\n\nAlso, we also don't know what room that is, it could be the home study/office or even his bedroom.\n\n>It is on nobody to make anybody else feel better or appropriate. \n\nSure, except the law disagree with that in many places, legally can't be nude in public in most western countries because it upsets religious puritans as they feel it is inappropriate.\n\n> This child who was looking out the window at 10 PM at night into their neighbors yard. \n\nAs he is free to do so.\n\n>The 11 year old is the problem here, \n\nNot legally where I live, the law here is if it can be seen without an aid, binoculars, telescope, night vison camera etc then the \"viewer\" is not at legal fault.\n\nIts only when you need an aid or have to take extra steps like climbing on top of the roof or into a tree that it is considered an invasion of privacy.\n\n>not the people who were in the privacy of their own home/area.\n\nMy point is that it is not a private space if they can be seen freely from any window in that house without aid.\n\nYour bedroom is private, but if you leave your curtain open you can't blame others for looking through the window that they can see freely.\n\nWhether that's because it can be seen from the public sidewalk or from a neighbour's windows doesn't really matter.\n\n>A privacy was put in place a 6 foot fence and trees that the child had to go to specific room to be able to see into the pool!\n\nStill allowed, you can freely look out of any window in your house, you don't have to avoid your widows to give others privacy.\n\n>A common sense and/or decency would have been if you seen somebody in their pool to not keep looking.\n\nCommon sense/decency are conceptual ideas that don't work in the real world, any system that requires these types of things to work will inevitably fail.\n\nAlso, they are not that \"common\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike I said, my vote is NTA because IMO OP is free to be naked in their backyard, but IMO the kid is also NTA as he is free to look out of any window in his house that he wants to.\n\nI say the AH here is the neighbour/parent that complained, they have the problem, so they need to find a solution, not push that work onto OP.", "There is nothing in the post or comments that states that before this interaction that the OP knew this window could see their pool/backyard!", "I think we\u2019re going to have to agree to disagree.  \nI understand a lot of your points, and some of that makes sense, but others do not and neither of us will change each others mind!", "Fair enough, I still enjoyed the conversation."]}
