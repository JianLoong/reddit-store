So, if your neighbors can see into your backyard, then full nudity would be illegal even though you're on your own property. But, I'd want to skinny-dip too.\n\nFrom a web site I looked up:\n\"Some states make a distinction based on whether other people can see you. This is where concerns related to indecent exposure arise. For example, if you sunbathe in your backyard, you may face trouble with the law. Being nude where others can see you may be illegal based on your state and local laws, even if you are on your own private property.\"", "NTA.

I've read and re-read the post looking for that and the only thing I can find is this:\n\n>Our pool is obscured by our trees so it does offer some shade and privacy from the neighbors.\n\nI think you are assigning \"some\" to privacy as well and ignoring the first bit about the trees obscuring the view.  So, the trees offer privacy and *some* shade not some shade and some privacy.  Look at the trees in your yard, they don't fully shade the yard they only shade *some* part of it, but you can have trees that completely block the neighbor's view but don't shade the entire yard.\n\nAlso here is the link to OP's reply answering your question.

Depending on local law, OP could also get in trouble for public nudity, as many others have pointed out. The kid was on his own property, so the invasion of privacy argument is a bit of a stretch.
