This year they moved back to our country. They always spent Christmas with his wife's parents and then came to our parents the next day without me present.\n\nA couple of years back I had a tragedy and got a lot for compensation. I invested and am now living very good from passive income. For the last 3 years I buy all the gifts for Christmas for my nephews and nieces. My siblings give me their letters for Santa and I go all out. I absolutely love seeing them when they open the gifts.\n\nI already got all the letters this year and have all the gifts ready. But then last week my mother wanted to give me another letter. She said its from my nephew from my oldest brother. I was surprised, but then told her that I wont buy anything for him. I dont even know him and I am not prepared to spend that much on stranger kid. My parents then told me that we cant single him out. That he would be very sad seeing other kids opening gifts and him not getting anything. I told them they can buy the gifts, and maybe my siblings will chip in. My mother started crying that they cant match my gifts and bagged me to reconsider. I refused. I am hurt even because I just found out that my brothers family will be with us for Christmas.\n\nNow they are text bombing me that I'm ruining Christmas.

Some 2 weeks after I came out my brother tried to reach out, but I refused because I had other things to think about, like, not walking ever again. Money was not in picture at that time, so this wasn't the reason he reached out.\n\n2) Santa letter was all my mothers idea. She was babysitting and other kids mentioned to him about the letters. He than asked my mother if he won't get any gifts because he didn't write any letter. My mother felt sorry for him and they wrote the letter together.\n\n3) Me and my partner decided we will buy the gifts for my nephew too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thank you all for your input.", "created_utc": 1670441681, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfb5i2/aita_for_not_buying_christmas_gifts_for_my_5_year/", "score": 6806, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who assured his parents you would buy gifts? Why were you estranged from your older brother? Are you still estranged?\n\nWould your brother be happy to see you buy the gifts for his son or humiliated? \n\nYou could distribute your gifts when your estranged brother\u2019s family is not there, the week before or after. You could return/ donate everyone\u2019s gifts. You could ask to meet the little boy you\u2019re providing for. You could buy him gifts and make this everyone\u2019s last year of gifts from Happy-Uncle. \n\nI suspect you rightly resent your mother\u2019s attempt at manipulating you into playing happy families. She needs to broker a reconciliation before Christmas and stop guilting you", "Why have you not had contact with your brother? Because of circumstances or for reasons?  If the first, it\u2019s entirely unreasonable to treat the kid differently from his cousins.  If the second, don\u2019t go, nor give the cousins their presents with that child present. \n\nOnly an AH splurges on a bunch of kids leaving one out.", "I have read the comments and your post, and if I have it all correct it sounds like you don\u2019t want to see your brother and you have no relationship with him. As a result, you have no relationship with your nephew and you didn\u2019t know they were attending Christmas after 8 yrs of being estranged. Your mom kind of sprung all of this on you, and made the kid write a Santa letter and now expects you to pay $1000-$2000 for this child, even though you don\u2019t know them. \n\nI am voting NTA based on this information because I am firm advocate of it is your money and people forcing reconciliations on others without prior conversations, heads up or consent is a big no in my books. \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffcMy vote cast, you would be TA IF you attend Christmas AND bring all of those gifts for your nephews and nieces and present them in front of that 5 yr old. This is very Grinch like and unnecessary. \n\nThus, you will need to make up your mind if you wish to attend and reconcile or not, and if you do not attend schedule/host another afternoon for your nieces and nephews after Christmas (Santa stopped by your house) and hand out the gifts separately. You can definitely recuse yourself from the gathering and parents will just have to explain that the gift giving is happening elsewhere this year. \n\nIt sounds like you and your family enjoy this Santaesque tradition. By forgoing the tradition, you need to be prepared for the consequences. Grandparents will be grumpy as they won\u2019t see the gift opening, and this is not a step forward towards reconciling with your brother (if you still wished it). \n\nIf you have a counsellor, etc, please discuss with them as there are short term consequences and long term consequences. You need to weigh all of it and decide what you wish to do.", "YTA- look I get that your history with your brother sucks. He jumped to a conclusion, that a lot of people would have jumped to in the same situation, and you felt the aftermath of that. \n\nHowever, according to your comment, he also tried to reach out once he realized he was wrong. It\u2019s up to you, if you want to accept his apologies and have relationship with him. \n\nHowever, using this info as context, I do think you will be the asshole to your nephew, even if you\u2019ve never had a relationship with him. He will be there watching his cousins open up all of these presents that were on their wish lists and wonder why that couldn\u2019t be him. \n\nHe\u2019s not going to understand that it\u2019s not his fault. That there\u2019s nothing wrong with him. This is also probably going to further damage the nonexistent relationship you have with your brother but also the existing relationships with the rest of your family. \n\nWhat happened to you and your brother sucked. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the only one who suffered from if however. As much as it hurt you, it probably hurt your brother too. Life is short and someday you might find yourself wishing that you had chosen differently. Taking and chance, extending an olive branch can be a good experience. And you know what? If it doesn\u2019t work out this time and you still dislike your brother, you don\u2019t have to talk to him again. \n\nI\u2019m saying all of this based off of only what info you\u2019ve provided so take it with a grain of salt. Good luck!", "YTA Great Christmas spirit there; that 5 yr old will remember you for life.", "I don't think you are an AH for how you feel. I think they have giant church bell balls to promise your money to someone they know refused to even entertain the idea that there was more than meets the eye in that situation from the past. Deep down inside, I'm an angry man. I would go scorched earth. Let the family know that Santa didn't get the letters and then go on a cruise with the money.", "YTA\n\nHe is a child, you are intentionally singling him out as not worth as much as the others. Of course it is your money and you can do what you want with it... assholes and non-assholes have that prerogative alike. You stated that you can afford it so do it. Use this as an opportunity to get to know the kid.\n\nEdited to add: I never said expensive presents. A 5 y.o. doesn't care about the cost of the gifts they just don't want to be left out. Further down I suggested that OP choose from a list of cost effective presents the kid would love and the parents would hate!\n\nSuch as: kazoo, fisher price karaoke set, toy guitar, harmonica, train whistle, candy, something with a lot of glitter, a stuffy that talks (think furbie) etc.", "NTA-If I\u2019m reading this correctly, you have been NC with your brother for 8 years and don\u2019t even see him during the holidays, but are now expected to finance his son\u2019s Christmas??\n\nThat\u2019s absolutely unreasonable. There is no need for you to do that. And if you are buying gifts for EVERYONE else, you are absolutely right that they can pitch in and cover one 5 year old.\n\nIf they all keep complaining, stop the tradition altogether. They are treating you like a bank instead of a very generous person.", "NTA. Your money do what you want. But you might want to scale it down and buy all the kids 1 gift or opt out altogether and spend the holiday at home.", "And the best thing that comes to your mind is taking the revenge out on a 5 yrs old? That kid\u2019s heart will be broken, you should know how It works as you spend time with your niece/ nephews from what you say.", "YTA", "NAH. \n\nI don't blame your brother for going off the deep end when he found his girl cuddled in bed with you. No one walks into something like that and forgets the visual. \n\nBut neither do I blame you for what happened. As a former beard, I spent many a night snuggled up with my gay men after a long session at the clubs, just for simple human comfort (especially when we were all drunk and the room was spinning), and yet invariably anyone who knew immediately went to *Ewwwwww, Sex*. Sooner or later I lost the energy to explain it to them - that just because Tab A and Slot B are in the same bed doesn't mean you're making a box dammit! So I fully buy your story about drunk-cuddling because I have seen it happen many a time. You did nothing wrong, in my opinion. \n\nHowever, you're not in the wrong for not wanting to spend money on a group of people for whom you have no familial love, either. You have ZERO obligation to provide presents to people you either don't like or don't know. The schism between you and your brother is sad, but I can't say either of you is in the wrong for feeling the way you do. Sounds like you've had more than one major traumatic event in your life, and that's got to be hard to deal with. \n\nWill their son be disappointed that his Santa list didn't get done? Yeah, probably. But your mom JUST SPRUNG THIS ON YOU. You'd already done your shopping. It'd be bad enough right there, but to then expect you to do this knowing the history behind you and your brother, isn't terribly reasonable. She put you in a bad spot. If ANYONE is at fault here, I'd say it's mom for opening this can of worms without talking to you about it first. She's speaking for your money and your holiday time. \n\nYou're not a piggy-bank, you're a human being with opinions and feelings. And \"no\" is a complete sentence. The first time you said \"He and I haven't talked in years, I'm not buying his kid's presents\" that should have been enough. \n\n**I am sorry, hon. I can see how Grinchy you may look to some, since there's a kid involved who knows NONE of this, but I cannot blame you for not wanting to buy presents that your Mom  promised someone else without talking to you about it first.**", "INFO \n\nEverybody's answer is wrong until we find out WTF happened with you and your brother.", "NTA. \n\nYour money is yours and you can spend it on who and what you choose. \n\nNow that being said, I can understand where your parents and partner are coming from. If your nephew is going to be there and watch your other niblings opening this awesome pile of gifts from Santa (not you, Santa), he's going to feel confused, hurt and left out. To be clear, it's not your responsibility to fulfill the obligation of Santa treats but you are likely to see one sad little boy on Christmas Day. \n\nI agree that I think if you've been estranged from him for a while, asking the remainder of your family to contribute in some way is a sensible solution but if this is your line in the sand, you're not in the wrong.", "You don\u2019t have to get him anything. Will you feel bad when all the other kids are opening their gifts from you and he isn\u2019t and the kid notices? Your nephew has nothing to do with the issues with your brother but then again you don\u2019t even know him. This one is hard but ultimately NTA. Maybe your Mom can get him a few extra gifts since she brought it up to you.", "NTA.\nIts not their money to spend the way they want.\nThey are not paying for the rest of the family, if they feel bad about it, they should buy the presents themselves, instead of trying to guilt trip you into it.", "YTA.\n\nYou think you're making some sort of principled stand, but instead put yourself in the moment when that child realizes his gifts are paltry compared to his cousins.  And the cousins may or may not feel bad or share because they don't know this kid well either.  Will you be thinking \"HAH, take THAT, older brother!\" or  \"What have I done?\"\n\nYou absolutely will be ruining YOUR Christmas and everyone else's, including this innocent 5yo, to make a some sort of point to your brother.", "NTA-I don\u2019t understand why the child\u2019s parents don\u2019t offer him a present themselves, clearly you\u2019re not close to the parents, and your brother didn\u2019t reach out in any ways, I don\u2019t understand why he would be mad", "Nta, you are not responsible for his child, and your mother trying to manipulate you and invalidate your feelings is a red flag\u2026If i was in the situation i would have text every sibling saying that as per you mother wish everyone is going to be treated the same so no presentes because they kind of knew that your brother was coming and didn\u2019t tell you", "Do you need to spoil a kid you\u2019ve never met? No, but I do think YTA for absolutely spoiling every niece and nephew except for one, RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM. He\u2019s old enough to see and understand your coldness towards him. He\u2019s old enough to see his cousins excitedly open their amazing toys and understand he was excluded. Imo this changes dynamics & you should either include nephew (even if on a smaller scale), OR simply give your gifts to the other kids at a separate time. You obviously have some problem with your brother and by extension his family, and that\u2019s your private business, but your mother doesn\u2019t want to see HER five year grandchild hurt in HER home on Christmas.", "ESH. You are wrong to punish a child for an issue you have with your brother.  Your parents are wrong to expect you to fully fund another full Christmas for an extra kid after you have already bought all the other gifts.  Your parents may not be able to buy as much as you can, but they should help you with the cost of gifts for the extra child.", "NTA\n\nPeople need to be less entitled to others' money. Also, the minute ppl start text bombing the OP, I don't really believe any of it anything.", "NTA but honestly since you want no contact with your brother and nobody warned you anyway, I would just terminate the tradition effective immediately and move on. Just tell them circumstances change and that you won\u2019t be gifting to anyone moving forward. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to buy for a family member you don\u2019t know or be in contact with a sibling you don\u2019t want to be in contact with.", "I'm going with NAH. It's true that your nephew is innocent, but so are you.  You've every right to refuse to buy gifts for someone that you've no relationship with and you've every right to maintain your boundaries. If this were instead framed as \"I refuse to buy stuff for my ex's kids whom I've no relationship with but I splurge on the their kids that ARE mine, AITA?\" you'd get a resounding NTA, and I find it rather hypocritical hat people are blaming you when in both cases, its someone choosing not to splurge on a child that they've no relationship with, AND EVERY RIGHT TO MAINTAIN HAVING NO RELATIONSHIP WITH. My suggestion for you is to stop giving gifts altogether because clearly, this is a hill that both you and your family are willing to die on and it will only cause more conflict. Or better yet, return every gift that you've bought so far and settle for something cheap so that your family can make up the difference.", "NTA. \n\nThey just now gave you a list and *expect* you to buy presents for the last minute invite?\n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nThat being said *please* get gifts for your nibbling. Please. \n\nThen after Christmas feel free to chew everyone a new a-hole. \n\nIt\u2019s his first year back with the family.", "A lot of people are saying Y T A because the child is innocent, and while that is true, OP doesn't know this child at all while everyone else in the family seems to have a relationship with the brother and the child. So why can't anyone spend their money on the child? Why is left up to OP to buy presents for a child they don't know? If OP is buying the presents for the other kids then the adults aren't spending their money on presents so they would have enough to buy presents for the child that they know and OP doesn't. \n\nYour brother is a horrible and disgusting person for what he did to you and his ex. That is your money OP so do with it what you will. Probably shouldn't go to Christmas this year though because I can't see anything good coming out of going. Plus everyone lied to you. I would rather someone hurt my feelings by telling the truth then to lie to my face and make me look stupid. Whether you want to return the gifts or just drop them off a couple days before is your choice, just make you you're making choices that will benefit you and nor pull you down.", "NTA it\u2019s your money and your choice", "So you fulfill the Santa lists for all the niblings. Except this one. The overblown over the top dream lists. \n\nAnd you want to leave this kid out of Santa gifts entirely because you fund them. \n\nBecause of an argument your brother has tried to apologize for, yet you refuse to even talk to him? \n\nHoly hell YTA.", "YTA\n\nAlso, based on your replies,, you don't care that YTA so why are you even here?", "YTA\n\nOne more smile.. The nephew is innocent in all, your partner is right.\n\nIgnore your brother, and enjoy the kids opening the presents.", "YTA with bells on.  The child is not part of the disagreement with your brother.  Publicly humiliating  him in front of the other children is very cruel.", "You're not wrong, you're just an AH. Your partner is right about your cousin:\n\n>he is innocent and one more smile wont hurt.\n\nIts your money, do with it as you will - but if you give thousands in gifts to all your nieces and nephews and then give nothing to this one, you will be ostracizing an innocent kid who is probably already an outsider to the other cousins, and in that case I think YTA. Being in the right and being an asshole are sometimes not exclusive.\n\nAnd its not like your brother wronged you - he just lived in a different country and had different obligations.", "Nta. It\u2019s your money but way to ruin an innocent 5 year olds Christmas so congratulations on that", "ESH- it\u2019s your money, but you\u2019re punishing an innocent kid for the actions of his parents. A 5 year old has no control over where his parents live or who they spend Christmas with, and yes him seeing all the other kids open gifts while there is nothing for him will make him sad and might ruin his Christmas, which in turn will upset the adults around him. \n\nYou\u2019re N T A for not wanting to spend money on a kid you don\u2019t know, but he is family and it might be better for everyone if you at least get the kid a few small things so he gets to open something. He\u2019s 5 so it doesn\u2019t need to be the big extravaganza you do for the other kids.", "YTA. You're obviously not short of money, and this five-year-old boy will spend Christmas with all his cousins. They'll all get big fancy gifts from you, and he won't. How do you think that will make him feel?", "YTA:  Because you're being petty.  Saying \"I'm not spending that much money on him. \n\n\nYou can buy him a $5 dollar coloring book.....he's 5", "YTA - your brother (incorrectly) assumed that you were cheating with his fianc\u00e9e and went no contact. So far we\u2019re at NAH - it\u2019s not unreasonable on his part not to listen to someone he assumes as betrayed his trust. \n\nBut now you\u2019re singling out an innocent child to pay for your collective mistakes? Yeah. YTA. You\u2019re willing to upset a little kid for no good reason. Kid may not be entitled to a present from you, but besides not knowing him every well you\u2019ve no good reason to single him out. \n\nDon\u2019t be that dude. Be better.", "NTA on not wanting to bankroll your nephew's Christmas for 1k-2k. Obviously the kid is innocent but he's also young, the price of things won't be as noticeable for him. I would suggest to maybe offer to pay for some of his gifts but not all so he's not without any presents, but set the expectation that you won't be contributing as much to a kid that you have not relationship since it's really not your responsibility. It seems like you're not looking to patch things up with your brother and he's not making any effort to reach out, but seems like he's fine with you spending thousands of dollars on his kid's Christmas.", "Here's the question I have for you: Do you want to remain estranged, and do you want to risk your other siblings feeling forced to take sides? Because not getting the nephew anything is how you make that happen. \n\nIt is your money, and I grasp that you don't know this child, but I would bet money that this will start additional fights, it will hurt the child's feelings, and you will feel like yta.", "Ooo - difficult one but I\u2019m going with NTA. That\u2019s not saying that leaving a child out is A-H-ish but for the fact that you do not have a relationship with the child because you don\u2019t have a relationship with your brother. It\u2019s unfair of your family to hide the fact that your estranged sibling plus family was coming by but more importantly to expect you to be the ATM for someone you don\u2019t even know.\n\nCan you make alternative plans for Christmas? Because you know it will be a shit show", "YTA it\u2019s not the nephews fault you and your brother don\u2019t get along, why are you punishing him? It\u2019s horrible buying gifts for all while one sits there and watches, just cruel to a 5yr old", "YTA\n\nDude.  How do you not think you're the asshole here?  What ever your brother did or didn't do is not for you to punish a 5 year old.", "YTA.    You seem to have a problem with your brother, but this is a 5 yo child who has done nothing to you.   You don't have to buy him  2k worth of gifts, but you should be the adult and make him feel included.  You aren't required to buy gifts for anyone so you can do what you want, but it would make you TA.    If you don't want to buy him gifts, give the rest of your nieces and nephews their gifts privately so as not to rub his nose in the fact you don't know him but be prepared for issues with more of your family members.     My sister in law and I don't always get along, but I would never let my personal issues with her carry over to her child.", "YTA. This child is innocent and you\u2019ll be hurting HIM, not your brother.\n\nAnd if you care about your other nieces and nephews, then you should know you\u2019re hurting them too. 1) you\u2019re letting them know you play favorites and 2) you\u2019re alienating them from their cousin. Do you really want to hurt all the children in your family? Are you that person?", "NTA\n\nYou have no relationship with your brother or his child. \n\nDoes this suck for the child? Yes of course.

It's not the child's fault that you don't have a relationship with him, and it's not fair to punish a child for their parents inaction.

Adopted kids are are just as much someone's kids as their bio kids. Friends can be more meaningful relationships than siblings. Parents can be abusive.

OP has 6 sibling one of which she doesn\u2019t speak to.  There\u2019s no mention to how many nieces and nephews there are, just that one nephew is the odd man out.  It was counter productive for Mom to invite brother knowing the relationship then compound it by handing over a list for the brothers kid.

Maybe OP and brother can fix things before next years gift giving and then the child will be a recipient of OP\u2019s generosity.

The second year after my mum died my dad wanted Christmas at his house. When my brother found out he kicked up a stink that he wasn't invited. Big dramas, Christmas nearly cancelled and then I thought nope, I'm going to show him what he's missed and went all out as usual (I usually make special things for everyone each year, cook my mum's Christmas ham etc). He has 4 children, oldest from his first wife, who he treats like shit, and 3 from his second wife. After creating chaos my idiot brother announced they couldn't actually stay to eat.  My oldest nephew was an adult and was already invited to our family meal as usual. So the table was set with beautiful personalised wooden ornaments I had made for each person eating, including my nephew. My brother arrives and had some sliced up ham in tupperware wanting to share it because it was mum's recipe. My other brother opens the fridge to show him the fully decorated ham and says \"Nah, we're right for ham\" (nice brother was equally furious about the chaos he'd caused). Anyway, point is - I barely know my other nieces and nephew, they've basically been told I'm evil. But I spoke to my oldest nephew about their interests and bought each of them a thoughtful gift. My brother and his wife were really embarrassed because they had nothing for anyone other than my dad. They just stood around looking sheepish and the wife even apologised. I would never let children be left out of the presents because of adult behaviour. Last year I made a very sentimental gift for each of my family - a chopping board with my mum's handwritten ham recipe on it and a photo book with all of her favourite handwritten recipes from a book she gave me before she passed. A few days after Christmas I got my dad to ask my brother if I could drop off a present for the kids, he made me leave it in the back of his ute (truck) in his driveway.

I have to wait all year to celebrate anything so I make the most of it. My mum always made a big deal of both my birthday and Christmas, she even did a stocking for me every year until I was 25. The year I turned 17 my parents business failed and we lost our house. Christmas was looking pretty bleak with only one present each and no Christmas stocking (usually every year we had an apple, an orange, a banana and some small gifts, then a couple of bigger gifts under the tree). I was working part time and had some money saved. We opened our gifts (sleeping bags) and my mum looked really sad. I said \"But I'm pretty sure we've still got stockings\" and mum was like no, I'm so sorry, and I reached behind the couch and pulled them out for everyone (we used pillow cases). I couldn't afford a lot for the small gifts but I knew how much my mum was hurting that she couldn't fulfil that tradition. Sadly we've had less Christmas teas together since she passed because we were the only two of our family that loved it so much. But every year we've had our family together I've done something personalised for the place setting. One year I made gingerbread name tags with a gingerbread house as a centrepiece, I've made elaborate origami ornaments with calligraphy name tags, I once made everyone's name in chocolate with hand painted Christmas themed chocolates (Santa and so on). That tradition started after I got divorced and it was just my mum and dad and me for Christmas lunch one year so we made the table super fancy. It helps me to feel close to her still to keep it going. Unfortunately my family can't really be bothered to do anything this year so I'm not planning anything but we are catching up for my birthday at least.

However this plays out I hope you and the other adults don\u2019t let that happen (all of the kids opening gifts in front of him that is). \n\nMy vote is NAH. Get the kid a small gift for good will.

Go somewhere fun.", "In a very Mother-Theresa kind of way, I would say the grandmother is the TA in this whole situation. But she is just passing blame to the OP. I'm also guessing the estranged brother also happens to be her favorite son. And assuming one son would sponsor the potential unhappiness of her other's son kids is just not sitting right with me. The child is absolutely not at fault, and everyone should normally chip in, in a situation like this, to provide the kid with the equal happiness all the other kids will receive when opening their Christmas gifts. But the grandmother could have also soften the blow a bit by not setting too high expectations for the nephew, saying maybe he will get some gifts too but not to the same extent. As I understand this is also last minute.", "OP says his brother knows about the tradition but it was their mother that initiated OP buying the gifts for this nephew", "Not true at all. 5 year olds regularly play games. Better than many adults.", "Why would the brother have believed them? If this was a post from the brother's p.o.v. at the time, I guarantee everyone would be like \"that's sus, she probably cheated on you, get out now\"", "NTA! You have your reasons and those boundaries should be respected.", "At some point you need to stop this tradition though cause you ll end up in debt playing santa \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI would say NTA but buy your nephew a small gift. His brother is the one who should buy the main gift.", "NTA\n\nI guess it's your money and you should spend it how you wish, but let's not kid ourselves into thinking money is part of the equation when you seem happy with this gift giving traditional, and happier still to splurge on your other nieces and nephews. Your mother is right in that the gift giving or lack thereof will single out your nephew, and that will be the case for you. I'm still going with NTA as it's your prerogative and if you did have a falling out with your brother, then your nephew is unfortunate collateral, innocent as he may be. \n\nI do like your idea to have your other relatives chime in for his gift instead, but your mother's insistence on it being you because of monetary value is a big red flag. Gifts are gifts, take em or leave em. Money shouldn't be a thing, it really is the thought.", "NTA. However, the entitlement of the parents and brother is INSANE! You\u2019ve never met your nephew, not only that but a simple way to avoid this is do a separate little Christmas with the other nieces and nephews at their home.", "Nta...  I don't understand why everyone thinks this kid is ENTITLED to get gifts from a LITERAL STRANGER because of DNA?!?!?! Why don't one of you y t a or but he is an innocent child offer to send 1-2k of your money to get this child some gifts? I mean, the only difference between that and OP using his money is the fact that OP shares DNA with the child. \n\n OP's brother is the one to originally go NC and kept OP out of this child's life . Does this suck for the child? Yes, but guess what life is unfair", "NTA you don't know this kid. It's your money and they  can all be glad that you buy the gifts because you don't have to.", "NTA, your money, your choice. I get why people are calling you TA, as the child is innocent, but he's still a stranger, and sounds like you know nothing about him anyway. If anyone your parents should be angry at, it should be your older brother for burning bridges with you. Watch out, they may try to force a reconciliation one holiday, so be prepared.\n\nHaving said that, from what I gathered from the edit, you will get a gift for the nephew. It's a very nice thing for you to do, but do it because you want to be generous, not because you're being forced.", "NTA and I\u2019m not a fan of family/parents shaming their kids into doing something just because \u201cit\u2019s family\u201d. Yea and? I see in your edit that you\u2019ve decided to buy, which IS nice but I wouldn\u2019t splurge on him. Get him like a $100 Target gift card lol $100 to a 5 year old is a lot \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, how comes his parents can buy him his own gifts? What the heck... People is getting really entitled nowadays, you're giving something to your nephews and nieces, GIFTING, isn't your obligation.", "NTA  \n\n\nWhen you decided not to buy for them you had no idea they were coming. I get that the kid is innocent, I really do. \n\nThat being said I feel like because you are financially well off there are some sort of OTHER magical rules that apply to you because of this. If you were flipping burgers would you be as obligated? No.   \n\n\nThese kids WILL BE GETTING PRESENTS. They won't be getting NOTHING.", "NTA unless you do it in front of the estranged nephew.  I would set aside a separate time with the kids that you are buying for to give them their gifts. If you're going to give a bunch of kids stuff right in front of him and not get him anything because you're piases at his parent, YTA", "OP is not a wallet, they are NOT obligated to chip in for a kid they don\u2019t know. Why don\u2019t you send OP some money for the present?", "I got some stuff for one kid from the dollar.25 store and that was some of their FAVORITE presents. I was just happy to make their day and then double win for it not costing a lot lol", "You REALLY think a 5 year old could care about where his gifts come from as long as he gets some? He's never even met OP. Probably doesn't even know he exists. Let the other adults buy for him. OP has done enough. This is a case that no good deed goes unpunished.", "OP said that their mom (the kid's grandmother) had the kids write the lists, not the low contact brother", "How would the brother know they hadn't slept together though? Weird that everyone is defending OP when Reddit is usually anti-cheating in any way, shape, or form. Goes to show how people will almost always vote NTA based on point of view of the storyteller", "Okay, so since it\u2019s a form of family activity, the nephew\u2019s parents should pay for it.", "I came to comments to say exactly that. \nPlus I have yet to witness a humble kid (later adult) or humble parents who gift their kids to that extent.  Anyone who does this is asshole in itself. OP with this tradition is ruining these kids. \nIts bad financial role modeling! \n\nI am well off, my kids get max 3 gifts for Christmas and I don\u2019t think i spend more than 30 eur per kid right now. It\u2019s not the gifts that hug and love the kid!", "Don\u2019t forget mom\u2019s side of the family\u2019s", "Just wanted to say that you are really fucking generous and there's no way you should have been put in this position ..\n\nYou are the bigger person and your entire family better be up to their neck in gratitude for your gifts", "I hate the word nibbling soooooo much!!!!!!! I've never heard it until this year.", "He reached out to OP while he was in the hospital before there was any knowledge of a payout", "They can\u2019t afford the over the top spending OP does. OP is doing this for the joy of seeing the kids happy. This little nephew will be crushed and always wonder why he\u2019s not enough. This kind of inequality plants seeds of insecurity that never go away.", "Yeah, they should. However, sometimes that\u2019s just not possible and making it seem like Santa favors the other children is not cool. Sometimes people are put in shitty situations and innocent people get caught in the crossfire. He should try to mitigate the potential damage to that innocent person by giving the nieces and nephews he wants to give gifts as himself rather than \u201cas Santa.\u201d", "I fully agreed with you, until I read the edits. For the first time, the nephew is going to at the family gift opening AND the mom/grandma made the nephew write the letter. Having a 5 year old sit there are watch everyone else open gifts off a Santa wish list while they get nothing is brutal. OP was put in a terrible position, and can hopefully be the better person and rise to the occasion of giving a 5 year old good memories.", "Thank you for your clarification!"]}
