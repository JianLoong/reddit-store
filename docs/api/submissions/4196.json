Who assured his parents you would buy gifts? Why were you estranged from your older brother? Are you still estranged?\n\nWould your brother be happy to see you buy the gifts for his son or humiliated? \n\nYou could distribute your gifts when your estranged brother\u2019s family is not there, the week before or after. You could return/ donate everyone\u2019s gifts. You could ask to meet the little boy you\u2019re providing for. You could buy him gifts and make this everyone\u2019s last year of gifts from Happy-Uncle. \n\nI suspect you rightly resent your mother\u2019s attempt at manipulating you into playing happy families. She needs to broker a reconciliation before Christmas and stop guilting you", "Why have you not had contact with your brother? Because of circumstances or for reasons?  If the first, it\u2019s entirely unreasonable to treat the kid differently from his cousins.  If the second, don\u2019t go, nor give the cousins their presents with that child present. \n\nOnly an AH splurges on a bunch of kids leaving one out.", "I have read the comments and your post, and if I have it all correct it sounds like you don\u2019t want to see your brother and you have no relationship with him. As a result, you have no relationship with your nephew and you didn\u2019t know they were attending Christmas after 8 yrs of being estranged. Your mom kind of sprung all of this on you, and made the kid write a Santa letter and now expects you to pay $1000-$2000 for this child, even though you don\u2019t know them. \n\nI am voting NTA based on this information because I am firm advocate of it is your money and people forcing reconciliations on others without prior conversations, heads up or consent is a big no in my books. \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffcMy vote cast, you would be TA IF you attend Christmas AND bring all of those gifts for your nephews and nieces and present them in front of that 5 yr old. This is very Grinch like and unnecessary. \n\nThus, you will need to make up your mind if you wish to attend and reconcile or not, and if you do not attend schedule/host another afternoon for your nieces and nephews after Christmas (Santa stopped by your house) and hand out the gifts separately. You can definitely recuse yourself from the gathering and parents will just have to explain that the gift giving is happening elsewhere this year. \n\nIt sounds like you and your family enjoy this Santaesque tradition. By forgoing the tradition, you need to be prepared for the consequences. Grandparents will be grumpy as they won\u2019t see the gift opening, and this is not a step forward towards reconciling with your brother (if you still wished it). \n\nIf you have a counsellor, etc, please discuss with them as there are short term consequences and long term consequences. You need to weigh all of it and decide what you wish to do.", "YTA- look I get that your history with your brother sucks. He jumped to a conclusion, that a lot of people would have jumped to in the same situation, and you felt the aftermath of that. \n\nHowever, according to your comment, he also tried to reach out once he realized he was wrong. It\u2019s up to you, if you want to accept his apologies and have relationship with him. \n\nHowever, using this info as context, I do think you will be the asshole to your nephew, even if you\u2019ve never had a relationship with him. He will be there watching his cousins open up all of these presents that were on their wish lists and wonder why that couldn\u2019t be him. \n\nHe\u2019s not going to understand that it\u2019s not his fault. That there\u2019s nothing wrong with him. This is also probably going to further damage the nonexistent relationship you have with your brother but also the existing relationships with the rest of your family. \n\nWhat happened to you and your brother sucked. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the only one who suffered from if however. As much as it hurt you, it probably hurt your brother too. Life is short and someday you might find yourself wishing that you had chosen differently. Taking and chance, extending an olive branch can be a good experience. And you know what? If it doesn\u2019t work out this time and you still dislike your brother, you don\u2019t have to talk to him again. \n\nI\u2019m saying all of this based off of only what info you\u2019ve provided so take it with a grain of salt.

I think they have giant church bell balls to promise your money to someone they know refused to even entertain the idea that there was more than meets the eye in that situation from the past.

Let the family know that Santa didn't get the letters and then go on a cruise with the money.", "YTA\n\nHe is a child, you are intentionally singling him out as not worth as much as the others. Of course it is your money and you can do what you want with it... assholes and non-assholes have that prerogative alike. You stated that you can afford it so do it. Use this as an opportunity to get to know the kid.\n\nEdited to add: I never said expensive presents. A 5 y.o. doesn't care about the cost of the gifts they just don't want to be left out. Further down I suggested that OP choose from a list of cost effective presents the kid would love and the parents would hate!\n\nSuch as: kazoo, fisher price karaoke set, toy guitar, harmonica, train whistle, candy, something with a lot of glitter, a stuffy that talks (think furbie) etc.", "NTA-If I\u2019m reading this correctly, you have been NC with your brother for 8 years and don\u2019t even see him during the holidays, but are now expected to finance his son\u2019s Christmas??\n\nThat\u2019s absolutely unreasonable. There is no need for you to do that. And if you are buying gifts for EVERYONE else, you are absolutely right that they can pitch in and cover one 5 year old.\n\nIf they all keep complaining, stop the tradition altogether. They are treating you like a bank instead of a very generous person.", "NTA. Your money do what you want. But you might want to scale it down and buy all the kids 1 gift or opt out altogether and spend the holiday at home.", "And the best thing that comes to your mind is taking the revenge out on a 5 yrs old? That kid\u2019s heart will be broken, you should know how It works as you spend time with your niece/ nephews from what you say.", "YTA", "NAH. \n\nI don't blame your brother for going off the deep end when he found his girl cuddled in bed with you. No one walks into something like that and forgets the visual. \n\nBut neither do I blame you for what happened. As a former beard, I spent many a night snuggled up with my gay men after a long session at the clubs, just for simple human comfort (especially when we were all drunk and the room was spinning), and yet invariably anyone who knew immediately went to *Ewwwwww, Sex*. Sooner or later I lost the energy to explain it to them - that just because Tab A and Slot B are in the same bed doesn't mean you're making a box dammit! So I fully buy your story about drunk-cuddling because I have seen it happen many a time. You did nothing wrong, in my opinion. \n\nHowever, you're not in the wrong for not wanting to spend money on a group of people for whom you have no familial love, either. You have ZERO obligation to provide presents to people you either don't like or don't know. The schism between you and your brother is sad, but I can't say either of you is in the wrong for feeling the way you do. Sounds like you've had more than one major traumatic event in your life, and that's got to be hard to deal with. \n\nWill their son be disappointed that his Santa list didn't get done? Yeah, probably. But your mom JUST SPRUNG THIS ON YOU. You'd already done your shopping. It'd be bad enough right there, but to then expect you to do this knowing the history behind you and your brother, isn't terribly reasonable. She put you in a bad spot. If ANYONE is at fault here, I'd say it's mom for opening this can of worms without talking to you about it first. She's speaking for your money and your holiday time. \n\nYou're not a piggy-bank, you're a human being with opinions and feelings. And \"no\" is a complete sentence. The first time you said \"He and I haven't talked in years, I'm not buying his kid's presents\" that should have been enough. \n\n**I am sorry, hon. I can see how Grinchy you may look to some, since there's a kid involved who knows NONE of this, but I cannot blame you for not wanting to buy presents that your Mom  promised someone else without talking to you about it first.**", "INFO \n\nEverybody's answer is wrong until we find out WTF happened with you and your brother.", "NTA. \n\nYour money is yours and you can spend it on who and what you choose. \n\nNow that being said, I can understand where your parents and partner are coming from. If your nephew is going to be there and watch your other niblings opening this awesome pile of gifts from Santa (not you, Santa), he's going to feel confused, hurt and left out. To be clear, it's not your responsibility to fulfill the obligation of Santa treats but you are likely to see one sad little boy on Christmas Day. \n\nI agree that I think if you've been estranged from him for a while, asking the remainder of your family to contribute in some way is a sensible solution but if this is your line in the sand, you're not in the wrong.", "You don\u2019t have to get him anything. Will you feel bad when all the other kids are opening their gifts from you and he isn\u2019t and the kid notices? Your nephew has nothing to do with the issues with your brother but then again you don\u2019t even know him. This one is hard but ultimately NTA. Maybe your Mom can get him a few extra gifts since she brought it up to you.", "NTA.\nIts not their money to spend the way they want.\nThey are not paying for the rest of the family, if they feel bad about it, they should buy the presents themselves, instead of trying to guilt trip you into it.", "YTA.\n\nYou think you're making some sort of principled stand, but instead put yourself in the moment when that child realizes his gifts are paltry compared to his cousins.  And the cousins may or may not feel bad or share because they don't know this kid well either.  Will you be thinking \"HAH, take THAT, older brother!\" or  \"What have I done?\"\n\nYou absolutely will be ruining YOUR Christmas and everyone else's, including this innocent 5yo, to make a some sort of point to your brother.", "NTA-I don\u2019t understand why the child\u2019s parents don\u2019t offer him a present themselves, clearly you\u2019re not close to the parents, and your brother didn\u2019t reach out in any ways, I don\u2019t understand why he would be mad", "Nta, you are not responsible for his child, and your mother trying to manipulate you and invalidate your feelings is a red flag\u2026If i was in the situation i would have text every sibling saying that as per you mother wish everyone is going to be treated the same so no presentes because they kind of knew that your brother was coming and didn\u2019t tell you", "Do you need to spoil a kid you\u2019ve never met? No, but I do think YTA for absolutely spoiling every niece and nephew except for one, RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM. He\u2019s old enough to see and understand your coldness towards him. He\u2019s old enough to see his cousins excitedly open their amazing toys and understand he was excluded. Imo this changes dynamics & you should either include nephew (even if on a smaller scale), OR simply give your gifts to the other kids at a separate time. You obviously have some problem with your brother and by extension his family, and that\u2019s your private business, but your mother doesn\u2019t want to see HER five year grandchild hurt in HER home on Christmas.", "ESH. You are wrong to punish a child for an issue you have with your brother.  Your parents are wrong to expect you to fully fund another full Christmas for an extra kid after you have already bought all the other gifts.  Your parents may not be able to buy as much as you can, but they should help you with the cost of gifts for the extra child.", "NTA\n\nPeople need to be less entitled to others' money. Also, the minute ppl start text bombing the OP, I don't really believe any of it anything.", "NTA but honestly since you want no contact with your brother and nobody warned you anyway, I would just terminate the tradition effective immediately and move on. Just tell them circumstances change and that you won\u2019t be gifting to anyone moving forward. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to buy for a family member you don\u2019t know or be in contact with a sibling you don\u2019t want to be in contact with.", "I'm going with NAH. It's true that your nephew is innocent, but so are you.  You've every right to refuse to buy gifts for someone that you've no relationship with and you've every right to maintain your boundaries. If this were instead framed as \"I refuse to buy stuff for my ex's kids whom I've no relationship with but I splurge on the their kids that ARE mine, AITA?\" you'd get a resounding NTA, and I find it rather hypocritical hat people are blaming you when in both cases, its someone choosing not to splurge on a child that they've no relationship with, AND EVERY RIGHT TO MAINTAIN HAVING NO RELATIONSHIP WITH. My suggestion for you is to stop giving gifts altogether because clearly, this is a hill that both you and your family are willing to die on and it will only cause more conflict. Or better yet, return every gift that you've bought so far and settle for something cheap so that your family can make up the difference.", "NTA. \n\nThey just now gave you a list and *expect* you to buy presents for the last minute invite?\n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nThat being said *please* get gifts for your nibbling. Please. \n\nThen after Christmas feel free to chew everyone a new a-hole. \n\nIt\u2019s his first year back with the family.", "A lot of people are saying Y T A because the child is innocent, and while that is true, OP doesn't know this child at all while everyone else in the family seems to have a relationship with the brother and the child. So why can't anyone spend their money on the child? Why is left up to OP to buy presents for a child they don't know? If OP is buying the presents for the other kids then the adults aren't spending their money on presents so they would have enough to buy presents for the child that they know and OP doesn't. \n\nYour brother is a horrible and disgusting person for what he did to you and his ex. That is your money OP so do with it what you will. Probably shouldn't go to Christmas this year though because I can't see anything good coming out of going. Plus everyone lied to you. I would rather someone hurt my feelings by telling the truth then to lie to my face and make me look stupid. Whether you want to return the gifts or just drop them off a couple days before is your choice, just make you you're making choices that will benefit you and nor pull you down.", "NTA it\u2019s your money and your choice", "So you fulfill the Santa lists for all the niblings. Except this one.

A 5 year old has no control over where his parents live or who they spend Christmas with, and yes him seeing all the other kids open gifts while there is nothing for him will make him sad and might ruin his Christmas, which in turn will upset the adults around him. \n\nYou\u2019re N T A for not wanting to spend money on a kid you don\u2019t know, but he is family and it might be better for everyone if you at least get the kid a few small things so he gets to open something. He\u2019s 5 so it doesn\u2019t need to be the big extravaganza you do for the other kids.", "YTA. You're obviously not short of money, and this five-year-old boy will spend Christmas with all his cousins. They'll all get big fancy gifts from you, and he won't.

Yeah. YTA. You\u2019re willing to upset a little kid for no good reason.

Be better.", "NTA on not wanting to bankroll your nephew's Christmas for 1k-2k. Obviously the kid is innocent but he's also young, the price of things won't be as noticeable for him. I would suggest to maybe offer to pay for some of his gifts but not all so he's not without any presents, but set the expectation that you won't be contributing as much to a kid that you have not relationship since it's really not your responsibility. It seems like you're not looking to patch things up with your brother and he's not making any effort to reach out, but seems like he's fine with you spending thousands of dollars on his kid's Christmas.", "Here's the question I have for you: Do you want to remain estranged, and do you want to risk your other siblings feeling forced to take sides?

That\u2019s not saying that leaving a child out is A-H-ish but for the fact that you do not have a relationship with the child because you don\u2019t have a relationship with your brother. It\u2019s unfair of your family to hide the fact that your estranged sibling plus family was coming by but more importantly to expect you to be the ATM for someone you don\u2019t even know.\n\nCan you make alternative plans for Christmas?

To lie is to say something you know/believe is not true.", "No thats called being wrong. If a kid thinks 4x3 is 13 he isnt lying hes just wrong.", "CAUGHT IN BED TOGETHER. Proof, boom. End of conversation.", "There is no indication of how long that \"warpath\" lasted.  It could be that the brother had a loud shouting match in the middle of the house that everyone in the family heard, then marched out the house and went non-contact; damage all done in the space of 5 minutes by the brother, plus any gossip-spreading by people who *weren't* the brother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Or***, it could be that the brother spent the next 8 months posting on social media and deliberately spreading around town his version of events, and sabotaging everything he could for OP and the ex-fianc\u00e9e.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeither the original post, nor OP's follow-up comment specifies which.", "How do you know that though? There is literally nothing here that would say otherwise. Hell, from what we have here we don't even know if OPs brother is aware of the gifts or even wants any for his son. OP said as far as he knows it's his mother's doing.\n\nAlso, hindsight is 20/20. You'd be hardpressed to find someone willing to listen to their drunk brother who had been caught in bed with his drunk fiance. A brother he had no idea was gay.", "I would love to see when the brother finally realize that he blow up his relationship with his fianc\u00e9 and his brother for nothing. He must b\u00ea feeling such a fool...", "And it's totally reasonable for the man who was a victim to not want to talk to the guy who destroyed his reputation for the crime of... Sleeping through another person lying in his bed. He shouldn't punish the kid but that brother seriously hurt him when he was innocent.", "Sure but he wasn\u2019t even open to a conversation after the fact. Just broke off his engagement and tanked both of their social reputations. He\u2019s also made no effort to rectify this on a public scale.", "But the brother is seemingly presenting those assumptions as facts when they\u2019re not. There\u2019s a difference between being wrong and straight up lying.", "True but once the danger was done it was done. OP has no obligation to forgive. I'm just hoping they go about things in a way that dosnt publicly humiliat the child.", "How does OP not speaking to him first prevent him from undoing some of the damage he did? Seriously, the man is an adult and is not hard to tell people, \"yeah I was wrong about everything I said. He didn't sleep with my partner and isn't a cheating, lying, backstabber who can't be trusted.\" If he did that OP might actually believe he's sincere and be more forgiving."]}
