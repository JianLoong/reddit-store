Who assured his parents you would buy gifts? Why were you estranged from your older brother? Are you still estranged?\n\nWould your brother be happy to see you buy the gifts for his son or humiliated? \n\nYou could distribute your gifts when your estranged brother\u2019s family is not there, the week before or after. You could return/ donate everyone\u2019s gifts. You could ask to meet the little boy you\u2019re providing for. You could buy him gifts and make this everyone\u2019s last year of gifts from Happy-Uncle. \n\nI suspect you rightly resent your mother\u2019s attempt at manipulating you into playing happy families. She needs to broker a reconciliation before Christmas and stop guilting you", "Why have you not had contact with your brother? Because of circumstances or for reasons?  If the first, it\u2019s entirely unreasonable to treat the kid differently from his cousins.  If the second, don\u2019t go, nor give the cousins their presents with that child present. \n\nOnly an AH splurges on a bunch of kids leaving one out.", "I have read the comments and your post, and if I have it all correct it sounds like you don\u2019t want to see your brother and you have no relationship with him. As a result, you have no relationship with your nephew and you didn\u2019t know they were attending Christmas after 8 yrs of being estranged. Your mom kind of sprung all of this on you, and made the kid write a Santa letter and now expects you to pay $1000-$2000 for this child, even though you don\u2019t know them. \n\nI am voting NTA based on this information because I am firm advocate of it is your money and people forcing reconciliations on others without prior conversations, heads up or consent is a big no in my books. \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffcMy vote cast, you would be TA IF you attend Christmas AND bring all of those gifts for your nephews and nieces and present them in front of that 5 yr old. This is very Grinch like and unnecessary. \n\nThus, you will need to make up your mind if you wish to attend and reconcile or not, and if you do not attend schedule/host another afternoon for your nieces and nephews after Christmas (Santa stopped by your house) and hand out the gifts separately. You can definitely recuse yourself from the gathering and parents will just have to explain that the gift giving is happening elsewhere this year. \n\nIt sounds like you and your family enjoy this Santaesque tradition. By forgoing the tradition, you need to be prepared for the consequences. Grandparents will be grumpy as they won\u2019t see the gift opening, and this is not a step forward towards reconciling with your brother (if you still wished it). \n\nIf you have a counsellor, etc, please discuss with them as there are short term consequences and long term consequences. You need to weigh all of it and decide what you wish to do.", "YTA- look I get that your history with your brother sucks. He jumped to a conclusion, that a lot of people would have jumped to in the same situation, and you felt the aftermath of that. \n\nHowever, according to your comment, he also tried to reach out once he realized he was wrong. It\u2019s up to you, if you want to accept his apologies and have relationship with him. \n\nHowever, using this info as context, I do think you will be the asshole to your nephew, even if you\u2019ve never had a relationship with him. He will be there watching his cousins open up all of these presents that were on their wish lists and wonder why that couldn\u2019t be him. \n\nHe\u2019s not going to understand that it\u2019s not his fault. That there\u2019s nothing wrong with him. This is also probably going to further damage the nonexistent relationship you have with your brother but also the existing relationships with the rest of your family. \n\nWhat happened to you and your brother sucked. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the only one who suffered from if however. As much as it hurt you, it probably hurt your brother too. Life is short and someday you might find yourself wishing that you had chosen differently. Taking and chance, extending an olive branch can be a good experience. And you know what? If it doesn\u2019t work out this time and you still dislike your brother, you don\u2019t have to talk to him again. \n\nI\u2019m saying all of this based off of only what info you\u2019ve provided so take it with a grain of salt. Good luck!", "YTA Great Christmas spirit there; that 5 yr old will remember you for life.", "I don't think you are an AH for how you feel. I think they have giant church bell balls to promise your money to someone they know refused to even entertain the idea that there was more than meets the eye in that situation from the past. Deep down inside, I'm an angry man. I would go scorched earth. Let the family know that Santa didn't get the letters and then go on a cruise with the money.", "YTA\n\nHe is a child, you are intentionally singling him out as not worth as much as the others. Of course it is your money and you can do what you want with it... assholes and non-assholes have that prerogative alike. You stated that you can afford it so do it. Use this as an opportunity to get to know the kid.", "NTA-If I\u2019m reading this correctly, you have been NC with your brother for 8 years and don\u2019t even see him during the holidays, but are now expected to finance his son\u2019s Christmas??\n\nThat\u2019s absolutely unreasonable. There is no need for you to do that. And if you are buying gifts for EVERYONE else, you are absolutely right that they can pitch in and cover one 5 year old.\n\nIf they all keep complaining, stop the tradition altogether. They are treating you like a bank instead of a very generous person.", "NTA. Your money do what you want. But you might want to scale it down and buy all the kids 1 gift or opt out altogether and spend the holiday at home.", "And the best thing that comes to your mind is taking the revenge out on a 5 yrs old? That kid\u2019s heart will be broken, you should know how It works as you spend time with your niece/ nephews from what you say.", "YTA", "NAH. \n\nI don't blame your brother for going off the deep end when he found his girl cuddled in bed with you. No one walks into something like that and forgets the visual. \n\nBut neither do I blame you for what happened. As a former beard, I spent many a night snuggled up with my gay men after a long session at the clubs, just for simple human comfort (especially when we were all drunk and the room was spinning), and yet invariably anyone who knew immediately went to *Ewwwwww, Sex*. Sooner or later I lost the energy to explain it to them - that just because Tab A and Slot B are in the same bed doesn't mean you're making a box dammit! So I fully buy your story about drunk-cuddling because I have seen it happen many a time. You did nothing wrong, in my opinion. \n\nHowever, you're not in the wrong for not wanting to spend money on a group of people for whom you have no familial love, either. You have ZERO obligation to provide presents to people you either don't like or don't know. The schism between you and your brother is sad, but I can't say either of you is in the wrong for feeling the way you do. Sounds like you've had more than one major traumatic event in your life, and that's got to be hard to deal with. \n\nWill their son be disappointed that his Santa list didn't get done? Yeah, probably. But your mom JUST SPRUNG THIS ON YOU. You'd already done your shopping. It'd be bad enough right there, but to then expect you to do this knowing the history behind you and your brother, isn't terribly reasonable. She put you in a bad spot. If ANYONE is at fault here, I'd say it's mom for opening this can of worms without talking to you about it first. She's speaking for your money and your holiday time. \n\nYou're not a piggy-bank, you're a human being with opinions and feelings. And \"no\" is a complete sentence. The first time you said \"He and I haven't talked in years, I'm not buying his kid's presents\" that should have been enough. \n\n**I am sorry, hon. I can see how Grinchy you may look to some, since there's a kid involved who knows NONE of this, but I cannot blame you for not wanting to buy presents that your Mom  promised someone else without talking to you about it first.**", "INFO \n\nEverybody's answer is wrong until we find out WTF happened with you and your brother.", "NTA. \n\nYour money is yours and you can spend it on who and what you choose. \n\nNow that being said, I can understand where your parents and partner are coming from. If your nephew is going to be there and watch your other niblings opening this awesome pile of gifts from Santa (not you, Santa), he's going to feel confused, hurt and left out. To be clear, it's not your responsibility to fulfill the obligation of Santa treats but you are likely to see one sad little boy on Christmas Day. \n\nI agree that I think if you've been estranged from him for a while, asking the remainder of your family to contribute in some way is a sensible solution but if this is your line in the sand, you're not in the wrong.", "You don\u2019t have to get him anything. Will you feel bad when all the other kids are opening their gifts from you and he isn\u2019t and the kid notices? Your nephew has nothing to do with the issues with your brother but then again you don\u2019t even know him. This one is hard but ultimately NTA. Maybe your Mom can get him a few extra gifts since she brought it up to you.", "NTA.\nIts not their money to spend the way they want.\nThey are not paying for the rest of the family, if they feel bad about it, they should buy the presents themselves, instead of trying to guilt trip you into it.", "YTA.\n\nYou think you're making some sort of principled stand, but instead put yourself in the moment when that child realizes his gifts are paltry compared to his cousins.  And the cousins may or may not feel bad or share because they don't know this kid well either.  Will you be thinking \"HAH, take THAT, older brother!\" or  \"What have I done?\"\n\nYou absolutely will be ruining YOUR Christmas and everyone else's, including this innocent 5yo, to make a some sort of point to your brother.", "NTA-I don\u2019t understand why the child\u2019s parents don\u2019t offer him a present themselves, clearly you\u2019re not close to the parents, and your brother didn\u2019t reach out in any ways, I don\u2019t understand why he would be mad", "Nta, you are not responsible for his child, and your mother trying to manipulate you and invalidate your feelings is a red flag\u2026If i was in the situation i would have text every sibling saying that as per you mother wish everyone is going to be treated the same so no presentes because they kind of knew that your brother was coming and didn\u2019t tell you", "Do you need to spoil a kid you\u2019ve never met? No, but I do think YTA for absolutely spoiling every niece and nephew except for one, RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM. He\u2019s old enough to see and understand your coldness towards him. He\u2019s old enough to see his cousins excitedly open their amazing toys and understand he was excluded. Imo this changes dynamics & you should either include nephew (even if on a smaller scale), OR simply give your gifts to the other kids at a separate time. You obviously have some problem with your brother and by extension his family, and that\u2019s your private business, but your mother doesn\u2019t want to HER five year grandchild hurt in HER home on Christmas.", "ESH. You are wrong to punish a child for an issue you have with your brother.  Your parents are wrong to expect you to fully fund another full Christmas for an extra kid after you have already bought all the other gifts.  Your parents may not be able to buy as much as you can, but they should help you with the cost of gifts for the extra child.", "NTA\n\nPeople need to be less entitled to others' money. Also, the minute ppl start text bombing the OP, I don't really believe any of it anything.", "NTA but honestly since you want no contact with your brother and nobody warned you anyway, I would just terminate the tradition effective immediately and move on. Just tell them circumstances change and that you won\u2019t be gifting to anyone moving forward. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to buy for a family member you don\u2019t know or be in contact with a sibling you don\u2019t want to be in contact with.", "I'm going with NAH. It's true that your nephew is innocent, but so are you.  You've every right to refuse to buy gifts for someone that you've no relationship with and you've every right to maintain your boundaries. If this were instead framed as \"I refuse to buy stuff for my ex's kids whom I've no relationship with but I splurge on the their kids that ARE mine, AITA?\" you'd get a resounding NTA, and I find it rather hypocritical hat people are blaming you when in both cases, its someone choosing not to splurge on a child that they've no relationship with, AND EVERY RIGHT TO MAINTAIN HAVING NO RELATIONSHIP WITH. My suggestion for you is to stop giving gifts altogether because clearly, this is a hill that both you and your family are willing to die on and it will only cause more conflict. Or better yet, return every gift that you've bought so far and settle for something cheap so that your family can make up the difference.", "NTA. \n\nThey just now gave you a list and *expect* you to buy presents for the last minute invite?\n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nThat being said *please* get gifts for your nibbling. Please. \n\nThen after Christmas feel free to chew everyone a new a-hole. \n\nIt\u2019s his first year back with the family.", "A lot of people are saying Y T A because the child is innocent, and while that is true, OP doesn't know this child at all while everyone else in the family seems to have a relationship with the brother and the child. So why can't anyone spend their money on the child? Why is left up to OP to buy presents for a child they don't know? If OP is buying the presents for the other kids then the adults aren't spending their money on presents so they would have enough to buy presents for the child that they know and OP doesn't. \n\nYour brother is a horrible and disgusting person for what he did to you and his ex. That is your money OP so do with it what you will. Probably shouldn't go to Christmas this year though because I can't see anything good coming out of going. Plus everyone lied to you. I would rather someone hurt my feelings by telling the truth then to lie to my face and make me look stupid. Whether you want to return the gifts or just drop them off a couple days before is your choice, just make you you're making choices that will benefit you and nor pull you down.", "NTA it\u2019s your money and your choice", "So you fulfill the Santa lists for all the niblings. Except this one. The overblown over the top dream lists. \n\nAnd you want to leave this kid out of Santa gifts entirely because you fund them. \n\nBecause of an argument your brother has tried to apologize for, yet you refuse to even talk to him? \n\nHoly hell YTA.", "YTA\n\nAlso, based on your replies,, you don't care that YTA so why are you even here?", "YTA\n\nOne more smile.. The nephew is innocent in all, your partner is right.\n\nIgnore your brother, and enjoy the kids opening the presents.", "YTA with bells on.  The child is not part of the disagreement with your brother.  Publicly humiliating  him in front of the other children is very cruel.", "You're not wrong, you're just an AH. Your partner is right about your cousin:\n\n>he is innocent and one more smile wont hurt.\n\nIts your money, do with it as you will - but if you give thousands in gifts to all your nieces and nephews and then give nothing to this one, you will be ostracizing an innocent kid who is probably already an outsider to the other cousins, and in that case I think YTA. Being in the right and being an asshole are sometimes not exclusive.\n\nAnd its not like your brother wronged you - he just lived in a different country and had different obligations.", "Nta. It\u2019s your money but way to ruin an innocent 5 year olds Christmas so congratulations on that", "ESH- it\u2019s your money, but you\u2019re punishing an innocent kid for the actions of his parents. A 5 year old has no control over where his parents live or who they spend Christmas with, and yes him seeing all the other kids open gifts while there is nothing for him will make him sad and might ruin his Christmas, which in turn will upset the adults around him. \n\nYou\u2019re N T A for not wanting to spend money on a kid you don\u2019t know, but he is family and it might be better for everyone if you at least get the kid a few small things so he gets to open something. He\u2019s 5 so it doesn\u2019t need to be the big extravaganza you do for the other kids.", "YTA. You're obviously not short of money, and this five-year-old boy will spend Christmas with all his cousins. They'll all get big fancy gifts from you, and he won't. How do you think that will make him feel?", "YTA:  Because you're being petty.  Saying \"I'm not spending that much money on him. \n\n\nYou can buy him a $5 dollar coloring book.....he's 5", "YTA - your brother (incorrectly) assumed that you were cheating with his fianc\u00e9e and went no contact. So far we\u2019re at NAH - it\u2019s not unreasonable on his part not to listen to someone he assumes as betrayed his trust. \n\nBut now you\u2019re singling out an innocent child to pay for your collective mistakes? Yeah. YTA. You\u2019re willing to upset a little kid for no good reason. Kid may not be entitled to a present from you, but besides not knowing him every well you\u2019ve no good reason to single him out. \n\nDon\u2019t be that dude. Be better.", "NTA on not wanting to bankroll your nephew's Christmas for 1k-2k. Obviously the kid is innocent but he's also young, the price of things won't be as noticeable for him. I would suggest to maybe offer to pay for some of his gifts but not all so he's not without any presents, but set the expectation that you won't be contributing as much to a kid that you have not relationship since it's really not your responsibility. It seems like you're not looking to patch things up with your brother and he's not making any effort to reach out, but seems like he's fine with you spending thousands of dollars on his kid's Christmas.", "Here's the question I have for you: Do you want to remain estranged, and do you want to risk your other siblings feeling forced to take sides? Because not getting the nephew anything is how you make that happen. \n\nIt is your money, and I grasp that you don't know this child, but I would bet money that this will start additional fights, it will hurt the child's feelings, and you will feel like yta.", "Ooo - difficult one but I\u2019m going with NTA. That\u2019s not saying that leaving a child out is A-H-ish but for the fact that you do not have a relationship with the child because you don\u2019t have a relationship with your brother. It\u2019s unfair of your family to hide the fact that your estranged sibling plus family was coming by but more importantly to expect you to be the ATM for someone you don\u2019t even know.\n\nCan you make alternative plans for Christmas? Because you know it will be a shit show", "YTA it\u2019s not the nephews fault you and your brother don\u2019t get along, why are you punishing him? It\u2019s horrible buying gifts for all while one sits there and watches, just cruel to a 5yr old", "YTA\n\nDude.  How do you not think you're the asshole here?  What ever your brother did or didn't do is not for you to punish a 5 year old.", "YTA.    You seem to have a problem with your brother, but this is a 5 yo child who has done nothing to you.   You don't have to buy him  2k worth of gifts, but you should be the adult and make him feel included.  You aren't required to buy gifts for anyone so you can do what you want, but it would make you TA.    If you don't want to buy him gifts, give the rest of your nieces and nephews their gifts privately so as not to rub his nose in the fact you don't know him but be prepared for issues with more of your family members.     My sister in law and I don't always get along, but I would never let my personal issues with her carry over to her child.", "YTA. This child is innocent and you\u2019ll be hurting HIM, not your brother.\n\nAnd if you care about your other nieces and nephews, then you should know you\u2019re hurting them too. 1) you\u2019re letting them know you play favorites and 2) you\u2019re alienating them from their cousin. Do you really want to hurt all the children in your family? Are you that person?", "NTA\n\nYou have no relationship with your brother or his child. \n\nDoes this suck for the child? Yes of course. Would it be nice for you to buy one gift, maybe? But everyone expecting you to shell out what sounds like a considerable amount of money is wrong. You are not obligated.", "YTA.

It's not the child's fault that you don't have a relationship with him, and it's not fair to punish a child for their parents inaction.

Your partner even reminded you that the kid is innocent. \n\nSo either don\u2019t go or don\u2019t give the other kids their stuff in front of the nephew. Doing it in front of him is an AH move. & if he asks why you\u2019ll what, say \u201cI don\u2019t get along with your dad\u201d and the kid will be like okay what has that got to do with me?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to buy gifts for anyone you don\u2019t want to, but it\u2019s rude and would make you TA if you give everyone gifts except for one.", "Like youre not an AH but also...the kid didn't do anything like dont punish him for his dad's behaviour", "And that's what makes YTA.", "Troll bait", "OP you can spend your money on who you want. You got lucky in life and buy all the presents for the people you know you\u2019re covering gifts for multiple families all of them can chip in and buy for your eldest brothers family but regardless they shouldn\u2019t get to dictate how you spend your money.

Some people get more/better gifts some don\u2019t get anything it\u2019s just life.", "So an innocent child has to pay the price for his ex-fiance messing up?", "Even if there wasn't anything physical typically being in bed with someone else's fiance' is a deal breaker.", "Wait.. so you and your brother\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9e slept together and somehow you feel wronged by the fall out? I don\u2019t understand how you came to that conclusion.", "You've got all that backwards.  You need to be apologizing to him for making poor choices.\n\nAnd your drunken drama doesn't mean a kid should miss out.  Consider it part of your penance.\n\nYTA", "You typed this and still had to ask if YTA?  Of course you are.", "Your social life??? Boo hoo. You were in bed with his fianc\u00e9e, no reasonable person will believe your ridiculous excuses. He is the wronged party, not you, and it sounds like he had the grace to contact you when you had a trauma, despite your betrayal. Your response to that is to punish you nephew for your own actions!", "But when he found you guys drunk in bed. We're you both dress all the way? But most people would be thinking something went on.", "Yeah\u2026 that definitely makes you TA. You\u2019re kind of terrible and I hope you rethink this.", "You sound **simple**.", "Since money is not an issue, how bad would it hurt to make a kid, even a stranger, happy. Plus this could start the conversation you and your brother seriously need to have.", "Bro... you serious? You fucked his ex-fiance and think you\u2019re in the right? Grow up! Yta", "So you fucked up, and now you want to punish an innocent 5 year old. Yeah, you\u2019re an AH.", "So you fucked up because you got too drunk and would therefore single out and punish his kid for your lack of judgement? Yikes. YTA 100%\n\nEDIT: Yes, you fucked up. Even if you did not have sex with his fianc\u00e9.", "I never said it has to be the same $$ and in fact I clarified this when OP responded to me in this thread. \n\nA 5 y.o. doesn't care about the money, they just don't want to be left out. I suggested OP get the kid candy, a fisher price karaoke set, a train whistle and a harmonica (among other suggestions). Kid will be ecstatic and parents livid. Sounds great to me.", "Please keep reading this thread. I never said expensive gifts. I fact I think a $3 Train whistle, a harmonica and candy would be excellent!", "Kids don't know money at 5yr old. Just by some flashy presents that don't cost best that much. He won't know the difference. A new bike and some Legos, etc. No no need to spend big money to make a child smile, look for some middle ground.", "I didnt give you an amount. At 5 y.o. the kid won't really know the difference (pre teen or teenager would be a different story). Just get the same number of gifts for him. For this situation I'm thinking a train whistle, kazoo, toy guitar, fisher price karaoke machine and or a harmonica, and some candy. Under $100 , kid will love it, his parents will hate it, seems like a win win!\n\nIt's your money but if you single the kid out with nothing or a single gift like white socks etc - YTA. We don't get to pick the situations we are in just how we handle it.", "HOW MUCH?!\n\nETA: I know you are getting slammed in the comments but I totally get where you are coming from. \n\nI think your good will in funding ALL the gifts is being taken advantage of. Since your family are presumably not paying for their own kids' gifts, the reasonable thing to do would be for them to fund this kid's presents between them. \n\nYou're not an ATM that just spouts money as required. You buy your niblings presents because you know and love them. You don't know or love this kid. \n\nSorry you are having a shit time. I hope you can work something out.", "And what about next year when you do know him?", "You don't have to spend that much. Just get him something that'll make him happy, whilst also annoying your brother. Like a drum set or loud, annoying musical instruments.

Yikes, that's as much as my entire Christmas spending on husband, 3 family members, and 2 friends.", "Would you spend 100-250 on a nephew that you don\u2019t know, yet? If he\u2019s going to be around for awhile and you\u2019re going to see him, it wouldn\u2019t hurt. You might even like him if you give him a chance. As others have said, he\u2019s just a kid. Ask one of your close nieces or nephews hous how they would feel if that happened to them? He\u2019s going to feel the same way. Don\u2019t be remembered as the uncle who totally excluded him at Christmas.", "Just buy him a cheaper gift?", "You dont need to do that. But dont punish a kid for your bad relationship with his father", "Literally, because the ex fiancee wandered into the wrong bed drunk while OP was passed out, without OP's consent or knowledge. Bro didn't walk in on them doing it.", "From what I'm reading, he is a gay man who had a drunk ass woman climb into bed next to him while he was already asleep.

He came out afterwards, but brother destroyed his reputation without listening to reason and then bailed the country. He also destroyed the reputation of his ex fiance too. Brother is an asshole and I don't blame him for not wanting anything to do with the whole branch.", "Yep YTA. I\u2019ve been thinking the same thing with each reply of his that I read. Not sure why he even put this out there. He doesn\u2019t care.", "Because this isn\u2019t an advice sub?", "Hm. Wow, that's not how the post read to me, but OP is much less just being a grinch here. I will stand strong that by singling out this nephew he will be TA though.", "Especially as OP says it\u2019s 1-2k. That\u2019s not just more gifts, it\u2019s also gifts like phones, laptops, gaming consoles, tablets. Even a 5 year old can tell the difference between 1 colouring book and several expensive gifts. And factor in that OP gives these gifts as Santa, the 5 year old\u2019s Santa gifts will never match that.", "If you don\u2019t go, do you think your parents will redistribute some of the gifts you bought for your nieces and nephews to your brother\u2019s son?", "Idk. I wouldn\u2019t be ok with being accused of something I didn\u2019t do.  Even more so if the person then maliciously spread these lies to literally anyone who would listen. \n\nI\u2019m usually on the other side of peoples \u201cno contact\u201d rants. And even here I do think that if the relationship was good before that, then forgiveness would be good for OP.

I genuinely believed nothing happened between him and brother's ex-fiance.", "Making amends for what? The way he describes it the ex girlfriend went to the bathroom and returned to the wrong bed. Nothing happened between them.", "It was the truth, It doesn't matters that It sounds as a excuse. His brother acused him of cheating, and got him problema with his social life. He h\u00e1s ALL the right to not want a relationship with him after that.", "He didn't even do anything - firstly he's gay and secondly he was drunk and asleep. He probably barely even noticed her flopping onto the far side of his bed. \n\nImagine drunkenly passing out in your own bed alone and being woken up by your brother screaming at you and his fiancee in your bed.", "Lack of Faith?\n\nHe caught them in the same damn bed. Bro would've had to be completely stupid to believe it was \"an honest mistake\".", "I don\u2019t think he meant they had sex. I think she walked into the wrong room and fell asleep in his bed and then brother walked in amd assumed the worst. At least that\u2019s the way I read it", "It sounds like nothing happened with him and brothers ex. She just got into his bed mistakenly and he didn't notice.", "Can you read?  OP did not have aex or fool around with ex fiancee.  When he was passed put drunk she accidentally stumbled into his room and passed out beside him.  Nothing happened.  And in fact he is gay.  But his brother went scorched earth and told false tales far and wide.", "He also said he came out so I assume he is gay but the older brother didn\u2019t wanna hear that", "If someone made a \"poor choice\" It wasn't OP. He was in his best, sleeping and didn't realize that his brother's fianc\u00e9 entered HIS Room. Honestly, I'm impressed with brother's \"boldness\" of asking anything from OP after that ..", "A drum set or something similarly petty might work, that should make the kid very happy without pleasing the brother too much", "I have no interest to know him. This is the last year I'm doing this. If I knew my brother was coming I would be elsewhere.", "Yeah seriously. Why not scale down a bit on the gifts then spend the difference on toys to donate to a toy drive?", "Its really gonna set the tone for how the other kids treat this one", "Bro tried to apologize for his mistaken assumption, but OP won't speak to him or allow him to.", "Okay, well more info and context would be helpful then.", "Woah, ok. That makes a huge difference. Deffo NTA. \n\nI feel like OP's family is kinda taking advantage of him tho. He's buying all the presents for all the kids?", "And? Doesn\u2019t need to buy the kid everything lol. Hell the only reason he hates his brother is because he found in bed with his fianc\u00e9", "As far as I understood he came out after the accident he got the money from, because he says my accident and not the accident/ situation. But I get why it is ambiguous.\n\nSo if the brother didn\u2019t know that he was gay I can absolutely understand his reaction. It is just human nature. And given that the brother reached out after learning that op is gay. I would attribute it to him not knowing at that time. \n\nBut in the end it comes down to when op told them that he is gay.", "Yes most people would be totally understanding when they find their fianc\u00e9 in bed with their brother lol", "Why can\u2019t the rest of the family get gifts for the nephew since they didn\u2019t have to get gifts for ANY of the other kids?

Why can\u2019t they respect that OP wants nothing to do with his brother after his treatment of OP? \n\nOP says he\u2019s ok with not having a relationship with this child if that means he has to deal with his brother. We can\u2019t just say \u201cwell he tried to apologize \u201c we have no clue what the brother did. OP said his brother destroyed his and ex\u2019s social life!!", "It\u2019s in a comment rather than the main body of the post unfortunately", "Oh yeah, I forgot about the Santa part. That makes it way worse! I feel so bad for this kid who's just caught in family drama he doesn't understand or have anything to do with", "Honestly that doesn't really make a difference. The Older Brother had a fit (as one would do), but later tried to reach out and settle things, but OP was so pissy that his brother got mad at finding him in bed with his fiance that OP is spiting the dude's kid too.\n\nLike, OP should *understand* why his brother was mad and anything he said was in the heat of passion. Especially if it was all a misunderstanding.", "It reads like a lame excuse though, and his brother tried to reach out later, but OP willfully ignored it, and now he just wants to spite a kid for.. reasons?", "Oooooooh", "He didn't specify that he's gay, just that he came out. He could have come out as bi/pan. And even if he's gay, it's not unusual for people to fool around with someone of the gender they aren't usually attracted to.

He also said he brother tried to reach out to him after he came out and HE is the one that refused to hear his brother out.", "That's an awesome idea!", "My suggestion would be to not go even this year. They know you were nc with him and didn't even warn you - the only reason you got any heads up was because they wanted to use you as a bank. Yes it isn't fair for the young boy to have to see his cousins open a bunch of nice presents while he gets nothing - but, it is also not fair to you, or your responsibility to ask you to supply it for him. There are multiple ways this can be avoided. \n\n1. They can supplement the gifts. If they all get together and put money towards it they can make it seem just as decent. 5 yr Olds don't understand money.\n\n2. They could resume the previous schedule. Which is actually best for everyone! Where he doesn't see them open the gifts, and you're not forced to be near someone your nc with.", "Why don\u2019t you have any interest in getting to know him? He\u2019s your nephew as much as all of the other kids. You sound like an A towards an innocent 5 year old", "But you do know", "I honestly hope your parents take back your invite to attend.

OP also mentioned, in the heat of the moment his brother ruined his and his ex's reputation irreparably. Merely apologising doesn't fix that. I wouldn't accept an apology until he does something to reverse the public damage he caused to OP either.\n\nEdit:\nNow, that being said, I don't think punishing the kid is the right thing to do.
