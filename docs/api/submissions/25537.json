She has gotten over 80% in every class test so far, by sheer blood sweat and tears. She never used to be particularly good at school and exams, she\u2019s of course an amazing kid in a million ways but really struggled with math, and other subjects as well. Her math teacher has a pinboard where she posts the names of two kids that have \u201cworked the hardest\u201d that week. She gives those kids a small reward, like a chocolate bar. I thought this was a good idea, because it motivates the kids who struggle with math. \n\nMy daughter was crying a few weeks ago about how she\u2019s never been picked as the week\u2019s hard worker. I asked her how the teacher picks, and she said she doesn\u2019t really know, but it\u2019s usually kids who don\u2019t do so great in tests. If they show a little improvement, they go on the board. This seemed really unfair to the kids who work hard and score well, like my daughter. \n\nYesterday we had the first parent teacher meeting of the year, and I brought this up to the math teacher. She basically said my daughter does well only because she is naturally \u201ctalented\u201d, so she only wants to give the hard worker reward to kids who are actually working for every mark. I just blew up on her. I yelled at her and called her a fucking idiot, and that she has no idea how much my daughter studies even though she\u2019s only in 6th grade for fuck\u2019s sake. I said it\u2019s really unfair to so obviously favor kids who don\u2019t get good grades. \n\nI feel guilty for making a scene, and also is the teacher right here? I might be biased because I\u2019m not a teacher, and my daughter is involved. AITA?\n\nEdit: Okay, I was out of line. I\u2019ll apologize to the teacher straight away. Thanks y\u2019all.", "created_utc": 1693052609, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161ttml/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_teacher_that_she_is/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you care that much just buy the damn chocolate yourself????", "YTA - You're crying about someone not treating your precious child as precious. Get over over it.", "\"breaking news: teacher shortage just got much lower and no one can identify why\" yeah YTA. You have 0 right yelling at this person. She has a hard time as it is basically looking after your kid and several other kids for 8 hours a day. \n\nKeep something in mind the next time you're upset that your daughter isn't getting public accolades by the teacher: your daughter is special to you but not to the teacher. The teacher sees 13-15 kids or so and they will be seeing a whole lot of other kids too. To the teacher your daughter is another kid who she has to work so hard just to get your daughter to pay attention to the shit she is teaching. \n\nOP you're deplorable. Go apologize to this woman, get her a $50 gift card or something and never fucking do this shit again.", "YTA - you didn't appropriately advocate for your daughter. Her teacher doesn't live with you and has no idea what she does at home. You're the one being fucking stupid.", "You are the reason teachers are leaving in droves.  Is this how you act at work when you meet an obstacle?", "YTA , maybe other kids work harder.", "YTA. You're right, the teacher doesn't know how hard your daughter works. It's completely reasonable to be frustrated by this, and by the weird system of arbitrary reward that is borderline shaming.\n\nBut you're also a grown up, and nobody is actually in danger. Don't yell and curse at anyone, especially teachers who already have it super hard and are under terrible conditions.", "YTA. You say your daughter works hard, but I can bet the other students work just as hard. Do you imagine your daughter is the only one in the class who studies? The teacher is in a much better position than you to know who deserves accolades; she knows their previous grades, their personal stories, and yes, their learning disabilities, while you have biased second-hand hearsay from your daughter. You need to humbly apologise to the teacher and buy her a big bunch of flowers for making a difficult job even harder. And people wonder why teachers are leaving in droves.", "So, you felt entitled to walk into a classroom and throw a ridiculous, vulgar tantrum because you don't like how your daughter's teacher tries to motivate her students who are struggling more than everyone else? \n\nI'm not sure what world you live in where you seriously don't understand who is in the wrong here. What you did was completely uncalled for and not even a little bit justified. You owe your daughter's teacher a sincere apology.\n\nYTA. No question about it.", "YTA. I can't believe you threw a fit over this and called the teacher names.\n\nInstead, recognize your daughter's efforts YOURSELF, at home, and let her know that people she encounters in life won't always notice her efforts, so it's important to be proud of herself, and not worry about the other people. Good life lesson to learn.", "YTA, that went from like 20 to 100 for no reason. Your special little angel isn't getting the most attention, because she's a normal person. Most kids get no special treatment in school, and unfortunately there are a lot of kids who desperately need the help. You can chalk that up to a lack of funding, and involvement of the parents. And no, involvement isn't showing up to one PT conference and yelling at the underpaid teacher, who is trying to do their best.\n\nIn my opinion, you owe that teacher a hand-written apology.", "YTA. Here a life tip: Trashy screaming people on reality TV are not role models. Grow up.", "YTA. Why in the world would you think screaming at, cussing at, and generally being abusive toward your child\u2019s teacher over a student recognition system WOULDN\u2019T make you an asshole? You acted like an unhinged psycho.\n\nPeople like you are why I left teaching and why so many are leaving in droves. Honestly, if I was that teacher I would consider requesting that your daughter be transferred to another class, or at bare minimum that any contact between you and me was to be have the principal or school resource officer present.", "YTA because nobody has a right to this reward, including your daughter. You seem really invested in her progress, and I get that you want her to get a level of recognition for it, but I think you need to step back a bit. There are kids with parents who are in jail, there are kids with parents who skip meals, there are parents who are abusing their kids. There are kids who have way harder life circumstances than your daughter, and maybe they get a chocolate bar from a teacher sometimes. Your daughter still has a way better life. I think you need to teach your daughter (and maybe yourself to some degree) that doing well on tests isn't about recognition. It's about being able to have a successful future. And you don't need other people to give you a pat on the back to motivate you - you need to find ways to motivate yourself so that you can do this year after year after year.

I\u2019ll excuse your daughter for not realizing that because she\u2019s an actual child, but you should know better.\n\nInstead, you lost it on the teacher and now you\u2019ve ruined everything.

Are you out of your mind?", "YTA because you blew up and yelled instead of just explaining that same exact thing calmly and letting her know how hurt your daughter was.", "YTA.", "YTA. The board itself is a terrible idea in my personal opinion, but you're over here as a whole adult screaming at a teacher and insulting them. That's just bad behaviour and it's not helping your kid in any way, shape or form.\n\nThis teacher will now know you as *that parent* and your kid gets to deal with the repercussions of that daily cause you couldn't manage to keep your shit together for that one yearly meeting. You fucked up.", "YTA.   \nFor shouting at a teacher.   \nYour poor daughter now has to go to class every day/week with that teacher, who every time they look at your daughter will remember your expletive laden tirade. Great. \n\nTeachers are humans too. And they can make mistakes. And you can politely and calmly enlighten them, lean in and say \u201cOh, gosh! We wish it was talent.

You have a point, but firstly you can\u2019t just call the teacher names, and secondly, is it really such a big deal? There are more important things in life than a chocolate bar and being called a hard worker. If she\u2019s doing well and working hard, she doesn\u2019t need anybody else to verify that. Apologise to the teacher immediately. Your behaviour was unacceptable.", "YTA - please stop being an entitled cow", "You are a bad person. You need to course correct immediately.

Calling the teacher a fucking idiot sort of guarantees that.\n\nSounds like your daughter is already realising the rewards of her hard work by getting over 80% and making improvements across the board\u2026 This is the REAL reward. Can you celebrate this at home? Make your own certificates/awards/acknowledgements?\n\nAt the end of the day, would you want a teacher to reward your daughter because they feel she\u2019s earned it, or because they feel obligated due to you losing it? \n\nLife is full of nonsensical bullshit reward systems - I hate to say it, but the sooner we all understand this the sooner we can teach kids to validate themselves instead of relying on a test result or a reward.", "Yta. It's about effort and improvement.", "YTA. Buy your child a chocolate and tell them yourself, they\u2019ve worked hard. If you really wanted to have that conversation with the teacher you could have explained in a different manner.

Completely and utterly - you seemed to have totally missed that the teacher has 30+ other students, and your daughter is pushing herself hard to study AT HOME.

One extremely important aspect of a ballet company is that the performance *should look effortless*. No one in the audience really cares about the hours and hours of sweat and tears, they want to see the outcome.\n\nI suppose I am saying in a very awkward way, that life is like that. People only see what they personally observe. \n\nAs your daughter is willing to devote so much time to her studies, have you considered obtaining a tutor for her?

You said your child usually gets 80%, that\u2019s above average hence she did not get the award. You need to apologise and set a good example for your child!", "YTA. You and your type are the reason why there\u2019s a teacher shortage. People like you are the reason why my son wants to quit teaching after just four years. And having been a teacher myself, I can guarantee you that all the teachers in that school are now talking about what an asshole parent you are.", "How do YOU give encouragement to your daughter?", "I laughed out loud at 13-15 kids. Try 28-35 in a class. If their sixth grade is at the middle school instead of the elementary school, that teacher has 30ish kids in five classes and only see each of those 150 kids for 90 minutes every other day along with the thirty others in their class.", "I believe as much as he/she is an AH for yelling at the teacher. I do agree with them its unfair practice by the teacher. No i have gone through same thing in my school and resentment is sad for the kids in that age. When you are good kid and follow the rules and work hard to keep your grades up you almost get penalized for it. Cause you have it together, like you never need help or acknowledgment.", "Criticism accepted. I will apologize. Seems a little odd though that you\u2019re swearing at me while being upset that I swore at someone, though.", "Or even more, with US class sizes because people don\u2019t want to pay taxes or teachers.", "Fair enough. I\u2019ll apologize to the teacher. You\u2019re right that being a teacher is super tough and super under appreciated..", "I don\u2019t see how he\u2019s wrong though her teacher without and proof or actual evidence DECIDED his daughter didn\u2019t deserve encouragement he shouldn\u2019t have gotten loud \u201cvulgar\u201d is ridiculous swearing is so normalized I wouldn\u2019t consider it vulgar (let\u2019s ignore the fact that I won\u2019t swear around my mom as a grown adult)", "Right exactly. OP, I don't think it's out of line to say, hey, just so you know, my daughter has a hard time with math and has been studying at home every single day. You may not see that work, but she's not naturally good at this. \n\nThen let it go!", "Right? What if those other kids work as hard as OP\u2019s kid but still only barely manage to scrape a passing grade? OP has no clue about this either kids, none. If I was his daughter\u2019s teacher I would be reaching out to administration about what can be done about this aggressive parent.", "Retired teacher/administrator here and I could not agree more.  Fortunately for me and the employees of our district the school board enacted a civility policy where we could end a meeting immediately when a member of the public becomes unhinged.  It was a very helpful policy that we had blown up to poster size in our IEP room and we started the meetings off with highlighting a few of the provisions with new parents and new child advocates.", "21 students in her class. We have had 8 months of school. (I don\u2019t live in the US) many students have been picked more than once and only 3 children have not been picked at all - my daughter and 2 kids who also consistently score well.", "This is the \u201calmost end of year\u201d parent teacher check in. There are basically no other parent teacher meetings, that\u2019s why I said first. Bit misleading though, sorry.", "If only all AITA questions could be answered so well. Brilliant.", "Perfect script!", "What possible reason would you think she's not the AH?", "As a former teacher, in situations like this teachers aren't biased against the students, but the opposite. They walk on eggshells and treat them like a ticking time bomb because they're afraid the parent will go off and potentially come after their job by going to the admin or school board, post about them on social media, or even file a lawsuit - all things which I have personally seen or experienced from parents in retaliation for perceived slights against their kids. \n\nI quit teaching after a parent demanded I grade her student's 3 month late assignment on a Friday, two days before report cards were due, because she was failing (I had contacted the parents about the grades for months and heard nothing).  I had already officially submitted my grades for the quarter and was going on vacation, so I said no. She'd had ample time to make up the assignment and she had never taken up any offers of tutoring or extra credit. The parents called the principal who demanded I accept the paper and resubmit my grades. She emailed it to me and I graded it from the airport. She ended up getting a mediocre grade on the assingment (which, i am 99% confident she DID NOT write herself, but i wasn't going to bring that up and risk escalating things) and it didn't even change her grade on the report card, which obviouslt resulting in more complaints from the parents and accusations of bias.\n\nETA I wouldn't be surprised if the teacher does away with the reward system. That's 100% what I would do in this situation. And YTA OP.", "Good idea, thanks. Yes I\u2019ll do this.

Abuse from you.", "They weren\u2019t swearing AT you, they were swearing in a sentence addressed at you.", "I can only do this to you online, and I'm sure you're not receiving the same level of vitriol this teacher is getting from similar parents who think their kid is special. You don't like that I'm swearing at you, take that and imagine how that makes the teacher feel. I also didn't insult you. Calling you deplorable is apt given the situation. Calling a teacher a fucking idiot is beyond unacceptable.", "Why not take the opportunity to show your daughter that you see how hard she is working and give her a meaningful reward.  It is not just the teachers job to recognize and encourage your daughter.", "Meh. Playing favorites isn't cool. She got wat she deserved.", "School just barely started! The teacher is recognizing two students a week, probably with treats she bought herself.

The teacher who works with these kids daily and sees all of their measurable progress isn\u2019t the best judge? She is in a FAR better position to determine than OP who only has his one precious snowflake\u2019s feelings in mind.\n\nAlso, if you think swearing is so normalized that it\u2019s no big deal to ask a teacher who is just doing her job if she\u2019s fucking stupid, then YTA too.", "If the daughter isn't feeling encouraged and doesn't feel like her hard work gets seen she may become discouraged to work as hard. Op was wrong for yelling at the teacher. The teacher is wrong for not wanting to reward a hard working kid just because she thinks the kid is just talented and not working hard. Esh, op this is why teachers quit, and to the teacher this is part of why \"talented kids\" often get discouraged and stop trying so hard because their teachers don't recognize the work they're putting in.", "Well your daughter doesn\u2019t struggle.

Where I am, summer is almost over, and school just started.", "There are these things called phones and emails... \n\nHonestly you're not at fault for wanting to discuss the issue with your daughter's teacher. You are at fault for 1 ) leaving it until the end of the year and 2 ) doing it the way you did.", "There's none to say OP is not the AH.\n\nI said that, even if I give her the benefit of doubt and try to see  from her side or lighter side, there is no reason to justify her behaviour.", "Absolutely this. When I was yelled at by kids\u2019 parents it absolutely did impact on my interactions with their kids. I couldn\u2019t act naturally with them, there was no joking around, I couldn\u2019t be verbally affectionate with them or touch them (hand on the shoulder or arm etc) because I was worried about being misinterpreted.
