She has gotten over 80% in every class test so far, by sheer blood sweat and tears. She never used to be particularly good at school and exams, she\u2019s of course an amazing kid in a million ways but really struggled with math, and other subjects as well. Her math teacher has a pinboard where she posts the names of two kids that have \u201cworked the hardest\u201d that week. She gives those kids a small reward, like a chocolate bar. I thought this was a good idea, because it motivates the kids who struggle with math. \n\nMy daughter was crying a few weeks ago about how she\u2019s never been picked as the week\u2019s hard worker. I asked her how the teacher picks, and she said she doesn\u2019t really know, but it\u2019s usually kids who don\u2019t do so great in tests. If they show a little improvement, they go on the board. This seemed really unfair to the kids who work hard and score well, like my daughter. \n\nYesterday we had the first parent teacher meeting of the year, and I brought this up to the math teacher. She basically said my daughter does well only because she is naturally \u201ctalented\u201d, so she only wants to give the hard worker reward to kids who are actually working for every mark. I just blew up on her. I yelled at her and called her a fucking idiot, and that she has no idea how much my daughter studies even though she\u2019s only in 6th grade for fuck\u2019s sake. I said it\u2019s really unfair to so obviously favor kids who don\u2019t get good grades. \n\nI feel guilty for making a scene, and also is the teacher right here? I might be biased because I\u2019m not a teacher, and my daughter is involved. AITA?\n\nEdit: Okay, I was out of line. I\u2019ll apologize to the teacher straight away. Thanks y\u2019all.\n\nEdit: The school year is almost over where I live. Almost all the kids have gotten recognized multiple times except for a few who consistently score well. And my daughter failed her standardized math test in 5th grade and went for a full summer of math classes to pass and enter 6th grade. So yes she struggled.", "created_utc": 1693052609, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161ttml/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_teacher_that_she_is/", "score": 5411, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't yell and curse at anyone, especially teachers who already have it super hard and are under terrible conditions.", "YTA. You say your daughter works hard, but I can bet the other students work just as hard. Do you imagine your daughter is the only one in the class who studies? The teacher is in a much better position than you to know who deserves accolades; she knows their previous grades, their personal stories, and yes, their learning disabilities, while you have biased second-hand hearsay from your daughter. You need to humbly apologise to the teacher and buy her a big bunch of flowers for making a difficult job even harder.

Good life lesson to learn.", "YTA, that went from like 20 to 100 for no reason. Your special little angel isn't getting the most attention, because she's a normal person. Most kids get no special treatment in school, and unfortunately there are a lot of kids who desperately need the help. You can chalk that up to a lack of funding, and involvement of the parents. And no, involvement isn't showing up to one PT conference and yelling at the underpaid teacher, who is trying to do their best.\n\nIn my opinion, you owe that teacher a hand-written apology.", "YTA.

You seem really invested in her progress, and I get that you want her to get a level of recognition for it, but I think you need to step back a bit. There are kids with parents who are in jail, there are kids with parents who skip meals, there are parents who are abusing their kids. There are kids who have way harder life circumstances than your daughter, and maybe they get a chocolate bar from a teacher sometimes. Your daughter still has a way better life. I think you need to teach your daughter (and maybe yourself to some degree) that doing well on tests isn't about recognition. It's about being able to have a successful future.

One extremely important aspect of a ballet company is that the performance *should look effortless*. No one in the audience really cares about the hours and hours of sweat and tears, they want to see the outcome.\n\nI suppose I am saying in a very awkward way, that life is like that. People only see what they personally observe. \n\nAs your daughter is willing to devote so much time to her studies, have you considered obtaining a tutor for her?

Unfortunately it is reactions like this that cause it. I often take that anxiety home which is something I need to work on but the cause should also be addressed. School staff are human beings and can make errors in decisions and judgement. It is not an art mastered the moment you get qualified teacher status. I am not just speaking for myself here. Reactions like yours happen almost on a daily basis and these are often reactions that are completely out of a proportion to the issue that caused it. I 100% get that parents are fiercely protective of their children and so you should be but it has an effect, often long lasting if you look at the staffing situation in schools. There isn\u2019t really a way for schools to implement a zero tolerance for physical/verbal abuse but that doesn\u2019t mean its ok to dish out. \n\nI am pleased to see you realise your error here though.", "This teacher is totally in the wrong and your emotional response is understandable.

And if she doesn't, then your daughter might feel like now she'll never get it because you tried to bully her into it.

Even if.your district does an early August start, she's been in school what, 3 weeks?? How many tests have they possibly taken.  \n\nThat's super quick for student teacher conferences as well.", "Okay so I\u2019m a secondary teacher (9th grade) and I want to say a couple things here: one, I don\u2019t agree with the rewards system that this teacher has implemented BUT ALSO I don\u2019t agree with how this parent acted.\n\nSo on the first point, it\u2019s been shown that having behavioral or academic success/ failure boards on display in classrooms does more harm than good. In fact, in many places around the country they are banned for breaking the academic privacy of students. Besides the main premise, I also don\u2019t understand rewarding the kids that \u201cwork the hardest\u201d especially since the hardest workers may never be able to increase their scores for one reason or another- especially in math where learning is progressive and each unit: topic gets progressively harder. If it\u2019s not based strictly off of improving grades then it really is an arbitrary contest that the teacher is running in her head which is also not a great idea because we secondary teachers can see up to 200 kids a day and there\u2019s no way to appropriately assess all of them.\n\nBUT anyways, this parent went nuts for no reason. The teacher told them that the kid is \u201cnaturally talented\u201d (something I would never tell a parent btw) which -in teacher language- really means that from what the teacher sees in class, this student puts in little to no effort and always understands the concept. Obviously I\u2019m this case that was not true so what the parent should have done is say \u201cactually, while you may not notice the struggle she has in the classroom, at home we work on homework for your class at length and spend disproportionately more time on your subject matter than others\u201d. Because obviously in this case, the teacher didn\u2019t know any type of struggle existed. It happens. Some students are great at hiding it & some teachers just have too many documented strugglers who are worse off to give more intensive instruction to instead. Not saying it\u2019s fair, it just is. And it will contrite to be since obviously this student can work through the content and assignments at home even if it takes extra work. Last note on the parent- like I said, teacher could have up to 200 kids a day and while we would like to know them all on a personal & academic level, it\u2019s sometimes just not possible and that has to be okay. Your daughter is important to you, and maybe important to other teachers but she can\u2019t be the center of everyone\u2019s world at the school since there are so many others that also are trying to get that attention and some that may even need it more.", "YTA and as a youth sports coach I would say the worst type of parent if you don\u2019t apologize for your behaviour.

I also believe the teacher is an asshole for straight up ignoring the kids hard work and refusing to give her the same opportunity to land on the hard worker board despite knowing she does well simply because she thinks she doesn't have to work to do well she's just \"talented\".

If the teacher doesn't want to reward kids she thinks are \"talented\" but still wants to encourage the kids that aren't as \"talented\" then that needs to be more on the down low. Like pulling them to the side to tell them you're proud of how hard they're working and give them the candy then.

Although kids will also game it by trying to lower some scores just to improve and get the rewards. But to phrase it about hard work, and dismiss all the kids who have been actively working hard this whole time? That shatters kids. That tells the kids that their parents are WRONG, and there is no point trying.

Those who don't usually have a reason why (trauma/abuse, learning disabilities, housing/food insecurity, lack of parental involvement, etc). It's not reasonable to assume that you'll be publicly rewarded because you're working hard. We need to equip kids to validate themselves without lashing out at others because they don't feel publicly recognized enough. This is a parent's job.

I sucked at math in the upper years of high school. Now, my math teacher, he was brilliant at math. Actually, his main job was teaching at an advanced university level. He only taught my class at high school as a \"hobby\". Now, when I would raise my hand and say I didn't understand his explanation he would continue to give the exact same explanation again. I'm not deaf, I heard you the first time around. So, I would still not understand and this man could only say the same thing. It ended in a way that whenever I wanted to ask a question, he would just start laughing uncomfortable and make some degrading remark. I stopped asking questions. So, I once told this to my uncle and what he said really stuck with me. This teacher is acting this way because he knows he can't explain it to you. He is being a bully because whenever you raise your hand to ask a question, he is confronted with his own incapabilities. People don't like that and will do whatever they can to prevent it. Safe to say, this man should have never been allowed to teach high school. \n\nNow, with your daughter I think it is the other way around, here the teacher is just patting herself on the back.

If you're proud of your daughter's hard work show her you are and then teach her that other people don't have to do anything to help her in life...this was a great opportunity to teach her that the teacher's names on a board shouldn't define her experience, but instead you taught her that if she feels hurt by something that isn't even there to hurt her it's completely fine to lash out and attack the person you believe is responsible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou literally taught your daughter the worst possible lesson you could have out of this situation.", "I share the same view, drawing from my partner's experience as a teacher, that the majority of educators generally don't connect a child's behavior to their parent's actions. My partner genuinely adores children and comes across a diverse range of parenting approaches.

That is information that should have been in her school record.", "Why wasn't the teacher aware that his daughter was almost held back because of her performance the previous year.  That should have been fully documented by the school.   Instead she told him that his daughter was \"naturally talented\".

Valuing effort only when it doesn't produce good grades will communicate to these kids that congratulating someone's effort is a pity award, that effort is for losers, and that kids getting good grades are just \"naturally talented\" and don't need or deserve recognition for their work. \nIt's literally damaging to their developing work ethic and self-image.", "I want to give this comment gold but I refuse to spend money on reddit so here's an upvote and some applause.", "I've personally told a co-worker (she was a first-year teacher, I'm the most seasoned in our hallway) that if admin wouldn't sit in on her future meetings with a parent who had yelled at her that I would.

I don't know when our country is going to wake up about the loss of educators due to over- whelming demands, unruly students, and unsupportive admin.", "Ugh, I'm still bitter about the time in high school when my AP Chemistry teacher gave me a B on a lab that I worked meticulously on and had checked against a student who had already gotten an A on it.\n\nI was a straight A student, but I could not wrap my head around chemistry at all and was getting my first B ever. My teacher was one of those \"I'll treat you like college students because you're in AP classes, which means I'll grade extra harshly\" types, so I kept getting Bs on labs that were \"right, but not detailed enough.\" This time, one of my friends (an above had turned hers in early, got it graded, and let me look at it to compare. I didn't copy it, but made sure that all my answers were correct and then proceeded to add even more detail than she did. I handed it in, finally ready for my first A in chem.\n\nB. I asked to stay after class, and showed my lab to my teacher, and asked him why I got a B. He started saying that it was because I wasn't detailed enough and he wanted more, but then I told him my friend had helped me with it and she got a better grade for less work and the same answers. He immediately started backtracking, saying, \"Oh, well, she comes to extra help so much, so I know she's working hard,\" and \"Oh, but I expect better from you.\" He finished with \"Okay, this time, I'll give you the A, but don't expect me to do this again and you really shouldn't compare grades\" (note: He had openly encouraged collaboration). \n\nFunny thing- I started getting As (when I deserved them) after that. Screw him and his overly harsh grading coupled with giving exceptions based on favoritism. \"Expecting more from better students\" is completely unfair, especially when it hurts their actual grades. It wouldn't surprise me if my earlier work in his class was also A-worthy, but his own ego made him only want to give out a couple per class. \n\nOh, and ESH to OP. I wound up in a similarish situation that the daughter was in, but I had the grace to explain my reasoning and the unfairness behind the system without raising my voice and shouting at my teacher. Shame on him for that.", "It's not terrible relevant since OP is still an AH.\n\nHowever to note, what was called parents night, I remember going to a few. It was weird since it was evening, though admittedly sometimes they'd ask you to go wait outside. I also didn't go to many but there were other kids there. \n\nI bow to your wisdom and comment on this one though, because there is no mention of the daughter being present and there would have been some mention.\n\nThanks.", "You act as if that is abnormal.

You're an asshole for instantly blowing up instead of discussing the matter with the teacher to explain how your daughter is working just as hard as, if not harder than those who are getting poorer grades and she should not be punished for her hard work.

She is obviously not aware of the behind the scenes work that goes on in yours and likely other homes. YTA for yelling, but not for \"feeling\" for your kid.  It stings to see your child suffering. Just a thought, maybe you could have just mention your daughters regret so the teacher is aware, then raised a quizzical brow and move on.", "YTA - Hard. I can understand the mentality of being frustrated by your daughter not receiving the validation for her hard work, but you said it yourself; \"she has no idea how much my daughter studies\".   \n\n\nYeah, she doesn't - so why can't you act like an adult and have an **adult** discussion around the topic, instead of melting down like a child in the same grade as your daughter?", "YTA. I\u2019m not saying I agree with the system but you were unequivocally a major AH, and part of the reason teachers are quitting and those left in it have stopped caring.

If your daughter noticed \"good\" students can't win, other kids also noticed. The teacher in essence is drawing attention to low-scoring students. Privacy violation? Maybe.

You realize YOU can celebrate your daughter\u2019s hard work, right?\n\nOn the one hand I do think it\u2019s questionable for the teacher to assume your daughter it \u201ctalented\u201d rather than working, but it sounds like the teacher is trying to motivate some students who are much, much worse off than her.\n\nAs a teacher, I can tell you that this is the sort behavior that makes it hard to get out of bed in the morning. People will flip out over virtually anything we do or don\u2019t do.", "Some teachers don\u2019t give any rewards, you pass because you\u2019re expected to and that\u2019s it.

Apologize and explain calmly why it frustrated you, and then go about your day. There\u2019s like 8 billion people on the planet, most will receive little to no recognition for any of their hard work. Hell, the teacher gets the same miserable check as any other teacher, nobody is giving her a piece of chocolate for putting in the extra effort. Parents can give that proverbial piece of chocolate by showing patience, understanding, support and respect.", "YTA however: The teacher made a real shitty choice. I had a friend who worked RIDICULOUSLY hard in languages class to get high grades so people thought she was just really good at Russian (but didn\u2019t see how long she studied at home.) the next year, they put her in the higher level class because they thought she was ready but she already worked way too hard in the class she was in and genuinely wasn\u2019t ready and after two months of her not getting anything and begging to be moved back the teachers finally believed her that she studied tons in the previous year and wasn\u2019t ready. You don\u2019t assume someone is naturally talented because they study really hard. You ask them how many hours they studied if you want to know who worked the hardest. However, you also blew up at her for not understanding your kid enough which is quite an AH move since she probably pays for the chocolate bars with her own money, and uses the chocolate bars to encourage kids who aren\u2019t very good. She only sees what happens in the classroom, and probably if she gave a chocolate bar to someone who always gets high grades, the people who get bad grades will also say she didn\u2019t work hard and is naturally talented.", "ESH you shouldn't have swore or yelled at the teacher. But the teacher should give rewards to everyone who works hard if your daughter was failing last year and she works hard and studies for every test then she should get an award. Or the teacher should get a different award system. Like how much someone studies or how much homework they turn in. Talk to her about that. Apologize first though.", "YTA.   \n\n\n\nI was going to say ESH because yeah she really shouldnt be picking and choosing like that, she has no idea how the kids are at home.  For all the teacher knows the \u201cnaturally talented\u201d kids could be spending 4 hours at home studying each day so that they get good grades.   \n\n\n\nBut that doesnt give you an excuse to say what you said.  You could have had an actual discussion with her about its unfair, and if you really didnt like it you could go to the principal.

Show your child how to handle difficult situations with respect.  \u201cHey, I\u2019m guessing you have no clue about this, but my daughter actually had to go to summer school for math just to get into 6th grade.  She does not excel at math and still struggles with it.  She studies excessively to try to be sure that doesn\u2019t happen again.  There is no natural talent, it is 100% hard work.  I  so proud of her.  I just thought you should know that she has worked and continues to word extremely hard.  It would be very helpful if you as her teacher    realized that and acknowledged that as words of encouragement go far.

Good grades and she gets a treat.", "YTA\n\nIf you disagree with the teacher, you can just tell them that.

You\u2019re clearly proud of her - just make sure that she can be proud of you too\u2026", "Yes, it's unfair. I was the top student in my class. Kids who lifted their marks above 70% got a lot of praise from the teacher and dinner out with their parents. If I got below 96% in a test, the teacher would tap the paper and go, \"What went wrong?\"", "YTA but the teacher really should have that set up so everyone gets recognized at least once. Kids hate feeling left out and that can often lead to not wanting to engage. So I understand you however you\u2019re an adult. Act like it.", "NAH I was a classroom teacher for many years. I always tried really hard not to publicly call attention to individual students' achievements or struggles. But sometimes the school would have a requirement, like a *Student of the Week* program, where I was encouraged to nominate someone and then display the students' certificates on the wall in my classroom. It's really difficult to select just one or two students, especially when I don't know whether or not they work hard outside of class or if it just comes naturally to them. I used to emphasize *growth and improvement* in my classroom over grades. \n\nThank you for being a great advocate for your daughter. I know it can be emotional.

The teacher should not make assumptions about her students natural talent or work ethic based on grades alone.", "ESH - Your behaviour towards the teacher was utterly unacceptable, she was not cruel to your child however unfair you might feel her methods are and the way you spoke to her was simply abusive and unacceptable.\n\nAt the same time I do see why your daughter is upset and I feel the teacher is being unfair. Every child needs encouragement now and again and it can knock a child's confidence if they are working hard and a teacher is slightly dismissive. I understand that teachers have a really tough job, but every child needs their confidence-boosting at times and this feels an unwise method of rewarding hard work to me.", "YTA.\n\nWay, way out of line.  If you had calmly explained how many hours your kid puts in, where they were last year, and show all the work and progress, that's a reasonable thing to do.

All you had to do was explain to her that your daughter worked really hard to come up with those good grades. Or even give her advice that the idea is great, but the actions are flawed.

That teacher came up with this system because she truly cares\u2014I bet you bottoms to dollar those candy bars come directly out of her paycheck, and she\u2019s getting screamed at because an entitled parent thinks her child should get a cut of the pie. Don\u2019t just apologize, buy her a box of candy bars that\u2019ll last through next year in support of the amazing example she\u2019s trying to be and the incentive she\u2019s trying to give so that these kids know that they can accomplish whatever hurdles that comes their way with a bit more effort.", "Number one: what a lousy idea!

It's likely that you already resolved everything.

I'd say that will serve her way more than pushing the teacher to give the reward. Let her know that you're fighting the cause but the teacher might still do things the same way.
