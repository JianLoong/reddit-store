She has gotten over 80% in every class test so far, by sheer blood sweat and tears. She never used to be particularly good at school and exams, she\u2019s of course an amazing kid in a million ways but really struggled with math, and other subjects as well. Her math teacher has a pinboard where she posts the names of two kids that have \u201cworked the hardest\u201d that week. She gives those kids a small reward, like a chocolate bar. I thought this was a good idea, because it motivates the kids who struggle with math. \n\nMy daughter was crying a few weeks ago about how she\u2019s never been picked as the week\u2019s hard worker. I asked her how the teacher picks, and she said she doesn\u2019t really know, but it\u2019s usually kids who don\u2019t do so great in tests. If they show a little improvement, they go on the board. This seemed really unfair to the kids who work hard and score well, like my daughter. \n\nYesterday we had the first parent teacher meeting of the year, and I brought this up to the math teacher. She basically said my daughter does well only because she is naturally \u201ctalented\u201d, so she only wants to give the hard worker reward to kids who are actually working for every mark. I just blew up on her. I yelled at her and called her a fucking idiot, and that she has no idea how much my daughter studies even though she\u2019s only in 6th grade for fuck\u2019s sake. I said it\u2019s really unfair to so obviously favor kids who don\u2019t get good grades. \n\nI feel guilty for making a scene, and also is the teacher right here? I might be biased because I\u2019m not a teacher, and my daughter is involved. AITA?\n\nEdit: Okay, I was out of line. I\u2019ll apologize to the teacher straight away. Thanks y\u2019all.", "created_utc": 1693052609, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161ttml/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_teacher_that_she_is/", "score": 619, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you care that much just buy the damn chocolate yourself????", "YTA - You're crying about someone not treating your precious child as precious. Get over over it.", "\"breaking news: teacher shortage just got much lower and no one can identify why\" yeah YTA. You have 0 right yelling at this person. She has a hard time as it is basically looking after your kid and several other kids for 8 hours a day. \n\nKeep something in mind the next time you're upset that your daughter isn't getting public accolades by the teacher: your daughter is special to you but not to the teacher. The teacher sees 13-15 kids or so and they will be seeing a whole lot of other kids too. To the teacher your daughter is another kid who she has to work so hard just to get your daughter to pay attention to the shit she is teaching. \n\nOP you're deplorable. Go apologize to this woman, get her a $50 gift card or something and never fucking do this shit again.", "YTA - you didn't appropriately advocate for your daughter. Her teacher doesn't live with you and has no idea what she does at home. You're the one being fucking stupid.", "You are the reason teachers are leaving in droves.  Is this how you act at work when you meet an obstacle?", "YTA , maybe other kids work harder.", "YTA. You're right, the teacher doesn't know how hard your daughter works. It's completely reasonable to be frustrated by this, and by the weird system of arbitrary reward that is borderline shaming.\n\nBut you're also a grown up, and nobody is actually in danger. Don't yell and curse at anyone, especially teachers who already have it super hard and are under terrible conditions.", "YTA. You say your daughter works hard, but I can bet the other students work just as hard. Do you imagine your daughter is the only one in the class who studies? The teacher is in a much better position than you to know who deserves accolades; she knows their previous grades, their personal stories, and yes, their learning disabilities, while you have biased second-hand hearsay from your daughter. You need to humbly apologise to the teacher and buy her a big bunch of flowers for making a difficult job even harder. And people wonder why teachers are leaving in droves.", "So, you felt entitled to walk into a classroom and throw a ridiculous, vulgar tantrum because you don't like how your daughter's teacher tries to motivate her students who are struggling more than everyone else? \n\nI'm not sure what world you live in where you seriously don't understand who is in the wrong here. What you did was completely uncalled for and not even a little bit justified. You owe your daughter's teacher a sincere apology.\n\nYTA. No question about it.", "YTA. I can't believe you threw a fit over this and called the teacher names.\n\nInstead, recognize your daughter's efforts YOURSELF, at home, and let her know that people she encounters in life won't always notice her efforts, so it's important to be proud of herself, and not worry about the other people. Good life lesson to learn.", "YTA, that went from like 20 to 100 for no reason. Your special little angel isn't getting the most attention, because she's a normal person. Most kids get no special treatment in school, and unfortunately there are a lot of kids who desperately need the help. You can chalk that up to a lack of funding, and involvement of the parents. And no, involvement isn't showing up to one PT conference and yelling at the underpaid teacher, who is trying to do their best.\n\nIn my opinion, you owe that teacher a hand-written apology.", "YTA. Here a life tip: Trashy screaming people on reality TV are not role models. Grow up.", "YTA. Why in the world would you think screaming at, cussing at, and generally being abusive toward your child\u2019s teacher over a student recognition system WOULDN\u2019T make you an asshole? You acted like an unhinged psycho.\n\nPeople like you are why I left teaching and why so many are leaving in droves. Honestly, if I was that teacher I would consider requesting that your daughter be transferred to another class, or at bare minimum that any contact between you and me was to be have the principal or school resource officer present.", "YTA because nobody has a right to this reward, including your daughter. You seem really invested in her progress, and I get that you want her to get a level of recognition for it, but I think you need to step back a bit. There are kids with parents who are in jail, there are kids with parents who skip meals, there are parents who are abusing their kids. There are kids who have way harder life circumstances than your daughter, and maybe they get a chocolate bar from a teacher sometimes. Your daughter still has a way better life. I think you need to teach your daughter (and maybe yourself to some degree) that doing well on tests isn't about recognition. It's about being able to have a successful future. And you don't need other people to give you a pat on the back to motivate you - you need to find ways to motivate yourself so that you can do this year after year after year.

I\u2019ll excuse your daughter for not realizing that because she\u2019s an actual child, but you should know better.\n\nInstead, you lost it on the teacher and now you\u2019ve ruined everything.

Are you out of your mind?", "YTA because you blew up and yelled instead of just explaining that same exact thing calmly and letting her know how hurt your daughter was.", "YTA.", "YTA. The board itself is a terrible idea in my personal opinion, but you're over here as a whole adult screaming at a teacher and insulting them. That's just bad behaviour and it's not helping your kid in any way, shape or form.\n\nThis teacher will now know you as *that parent* and your kid gets to deal with the repercussions of that daily cause you couldn't manage to keep your shit together for that one yearly meeting. You fucked up.", "YTA.   \nFor shouting at a teacher.   \nYour poor daughter now has to go to class every day/week with that teacher, who every time they look at your daughter will remember your expletive laden tirade. Great. \n\nTeachers are humans too. And they can make mistakes. And you can politely and calmly enlighten them, lean in and say \u201cOh, gosh! We wish it was talent.

You have a point, but firstly you can\u2019t just call the teacher names, and secondly, is it really such a big deal? There are more important things in life than a chocolate bar and being called a hard worker. If she\u2019s doing well and working hard, she doesn\u2019t need anybody else to verify that. Apologise to the teacher immediately. Your behaviour was unacceptable.", "YTA - please stop being an entitled cow", "You are a bad person. You need to course correct immediately.

Calling the teacher a fucking idiot sort of guarantees that.\n\nSounds like your daughter is already realising the rewards of her hard work by getting over 80% and making improvements across the board\u2026 This is the REAL reward. Can you celebrate this at home? Make your own certificates/awards/acknowledgements?\n\nAt the end of the day, would you want a teacher to reward your daughter because they feel she\u2019s earned it, or because they feel obligated due to you losing it? \n\nLife is full of nonsensical bullshit reward systems - I hate to say it, but the sooner we all understand this the sooner we can teach kids to validate themselves instead of relying on a test result or a reward.", "Yta. It's about effort and improvement.", "YTA. Buy your child a chocolate and tell them yourself, they\u2019ve worked hard. If you really wanted to have that conversation with the teacher you could have explained in a different manner. I don\u2019t agree with the teachers thinking, because simply not rewarding someone bc they are talented doesn\u2019t give them any motivation and when they reach something harder where they do have to study hard, it\u2019s going to be way harder, saying this from experience.

Completely and utterly - you seemed to have totally missed that the teacher has 30+ other students, and your daughter is pushing herself hard to study AT HOME.

One extremely important aspect of a ballet company is that the performance *should look effortless*.

I taught high school for a few years and every week I would email praise home to 5 kids- usually 2 kids who consistently did well and 3 kids who weren\u2019t pulling amazing grades but I could tell they were trying. If a kid doesn\u2019t make good grades but tries hard, they\u2019re more likely to lose that motivation because what\u2019s the point?

Additionally, if you are in a southern state who hates the standardized curriculum, she is probably creating her own math lessons because we refuse the Common Core because of government overreach.  She also has to attend school fundraisers and PTA in the evenings as well as putting on little shows and plays, even if it's not her class, teachers are pushed to show up on their own time to \"support\" the kids and parents.\n\nYou, sir, are a huge asshole.

You just made a mountain out of a molehill. \n\nWe just banned a parent  from ever setting foot on our campus for yelling the f-word at our office staff.

Also you're raising your kid to be an asshole too.\n\nInstead of explaining to your daughter that other kids who are struggling will benefit a lot from that chocolate, you teach her by example that it's ok to enter a school and yell at a teacher just because you're stupid. There are monkeys in the wild more civilized than you.", "YTA. You can make your points without blowing up and calling her names. Go ahead and apologize, but you've done irreparable harm to this relationship.", "And then people wonder why so few want to become teachers... Well yeah the shit pay too, but asshole parents like OP are at the top of the list.", "Wow - that threw me back to 2nd grade!

Welllll  shoot forward to grade 13 (Canada in the '80s)... after years of struggles, I'm finally diagnosed with dyscalculia. Same teacher would yell at me for reading ahead.  I still hate her. \nOP - that teacher is sending a horrible message to all the students.  Recognizing those struggling in a positive manner is good, but dismissing the other students is wrong.

She is a rock star.", "YTA -- surprised you had to ask Reddit about it.  Having said that...the idea of an apology and a gift certificate sounds like a really good idea.\n\nFor future...a better way to have approached this would be to have suggested an alternative -- like expanding the categories of who gets chocolate. Maybe in addition to the most improved/hardest working that are currently getting chocolate, she could also give chocolate to the highest score, or the students in the highest 5% of scores -- that way, your daughter would probably get included at some point.\n\nYou're not the asshole for seeing that the current way of doing it will always exclude the high excelling, which is de-motivating to those students.

I'm a long time teacher, and I can't tell you there is no way to assess who is working hard. Most improved, perhaps.

Good point!", "Probably", "You possibly had quite a valid point about how the hardest worker is chosen.

Unfortunately it is reactions like this that cause it. I often take that anxiety home which is something I need to work on but the cause should also be addressed. School staff are human beings and can make errors in decisions and judgement. It is not an art mastered the moment you get qualified teacher status. I am not just speaking for myself here. Reactions like yours happen almost on a daily basis and these are often reactions that are completely out of a proportion to the issue that caused it. I 100% get that parents are fiercely protective of their children and so you should be but it has an effect, often long lasting if you look at the staffing situation in schools. There isn\u2019t really a way for schools to implement a zero tolerance for physical/verbal abuse but that doesn\u2019t mean its ok to dish out. \n\nI am pleased to see you realise your error here though.", "This teacher is totally in the wrong and your emotional response is understandable.

If your daughter was at the meeting and saw all this, then even if the teacher DOES recognize your daughter, she's gonna feel like her teacher was just bullied into it. And if she doesn't, then your daughter might feel like now she'll never get it because you tried to bully her into it. What you did makes this a no win situation", "Info: when did your kid go back to school? Most places start mid August with some not going back until after labor day.  Even if.your district does an early August start, she's been in school what, 3 weeks?? How many tests have they possibly taken.  \n\nThat's super quick for student teacher conferences as well.", "Okay so I\u2019m a secondary teacher (9th grade) and I want to say a couple things here: one, I don\u2019t agree with the rewards system that this teacher has implemented BUT ALSO I don\u2019t agree with how this parent acted.\n\nSo on the first point, it\u2019s been shown that having behavioral or academic success/ failure boards on display in classrooms does more harm than good. In fact, in many places around the country they are banned for breaking the academic privacy of students. Besides the main premise, I also don\u2019t understand rewarding the kids that \u201cwork the hardest\u201d especially since the hardest workers may never be able to increase their scores for one reason or another- especially in math where learning is progressive and each unit: topic gets progressively harder. If it\u2019s not based strictly off of improving grades then it really is an arbitrary contest that the teacher is running in her head which is also not a great idea because we secondary teachers can see up to 200 kids a day and there\u2019s no way to appropriately assess all of them.\n\nBUT anyways, this parent went nuts for no reason. The teacher told them that the kid is \u201cnaturally talented\u201d (something I would never tell a parent btw) which -in teacher language- really means that from what the teacher sees in class, this student puts in little to no effort and always understands the concept. Obviously I\u2019m this case that was not true so what the parent should have done is say \u201cactually, while you may not notice the struggle she has in the classroom, at home we work on homework for your class at length and spend disproportionately more time on your subject matter than others\u201d. Because obviously in this case, the teacher didn\u2019t know any type of struggle existed. It happens. Some students are great at hiding it & some teachers just have too many documented strugglers who are worse off to give more intensive instruction to instead. Not saying it\u2019s fair, it just is. And it will contrite to be since obviously this student can work through the content and assignments at home even if it takes extra work. Last note on the parent- like I said, teacher could have up to 200 kids a day and while we would like to know them all on a personal & academic level, it\u2019s sometimes just not possible and that has to be okay. Your daughter is important to you, and maybe important to other teachers but she can\u2019t be the center of everyone\u2019s world at the school since there are so many others that also are trying to get that attention and some that may even need it more.", "YTA and as a youth sports coach I would say the worst type of parent if you don\u2019t apologize for your behaviour. You absolutely nailed it with your first sentence. You did something awful, and you know it. The rest should be a given, which is simply that you apologize profusely.

A kid could easily go through this situation and think \"well I guess i should stop trying since my teacher thinks I don't need to and my work goes unrecognized anyway\". \n\nThe mother went too far, no one here disagrees with that. I'm simply adding that the teacher isn't right either. All kids need encouragement, not just the ones that aren't as \"talented\" as the others. If the teacher doesn't want to reward kids she thinks are \"talented\" but still wants to encourage the kids that aren't as \"talented\" then that needs to be more on the down low. Like pulling them to the side to tell them you're proud of how hard they're working and give them the candy then. A board for all the class to see that is presented as the board for students that are working hard when the teacher has no intention of letting some of the kids even have a chance at making it onto the board is not the way to go.", "OP also said\n\n>Her math teacher has a pinboard where she posts the names of two kids that have \u201cworked the hardest\u201d that week.\n\nSo the teacher labels it as \"worked hardest\" but actually puts on \"improved\".", "You had different classes in primary school?", "You had algebra @primary school?", "I will start by telling you that a lot of college degrees won\u2019t require you to do any math, unless your college includes some type of math under their general undergraduate requirements. Even then, colleges know not everyone wants to take calculus and there are usually options for \u201cnon-math\u201d people to earn their math credits. \n\nAlso, in college you are often allowed to use resources they don\u2019t always let you have in high school, like calculators and formula sheets. \n\nWhen I had to brush up on higher math for a certification exam, I leaned a lot on YouTube videos. There\u2019s a channel called The Chemistry Tutor or something along those lines that was great. Khan Academy is a cliche recommendation but it really is a good way to learn if you are someone comfortable managing your own learning.", "No one said work one on one, they said include them in the board.", "I had lots of fulfillment at home as a kid. But kids aren't stupid. We know (in a healthy home) our parents are our cheerleaders. When no one on the outside bothers to enforce that, we take notice.\n\nIf the teacher had something praising improvement only? It smarts but kids can reason through it. Although kids will also game it by trying to lower some scores just to improve and get the rewards. But to phrase it about hard work, and dismiss all the kids who have been actively working hard this whole time? That shatters kids. That tells the kids that their parents are WRONG, and there is no point trying. Your work will be ignored and you should just give up, because clearly something is wrong with you.\n\nTeachers aren't parents, but the lessons they teach are vital too. We can't excuse damaging nonsense because \"It's hard.\" Now Dad is also in the wrong for how he went about it, but that doesn't just excuse away the other half of this.", "Ah yes because it definitely still wouldn't discourage her. As we all know in adult life when you see your boss giving rewards to underperforming coworkers while ignoring the worker doing more than their share of work that worker wouldn't eventually get upset and fed up about not being recognized for what they do.", "Once again totally missed the point.  Not wasting my time to explain it to you again.", "High school.", "By your use of \"primary school,\" I'm going to assume you are in the UK. The US and UK school systems are ***vastly*** different. Mainly, the UK actually cares about students, teachers, and kids actually learning. Meanwhile, in the US, they care about banning books, shoving as many kids in a classroom as possible to keep costs low, and force teachers out in order to force kids into private schools because they ***really*** want to dismantle public education.", "The quote I put in my comment absolutely implies far more than just including them on the board. Not to mention, there are children in the class that apparently need more encouragement from the teacher than OP's daughter does. She is self motivated enough, so she doesn't need the extra motivation as much as other children that are struggling more do. \n\nAnd again, if not being included on the board brings the daughter to literal tears, perhaps OP should work on fulfilling the need for encouragement at home. Apparently that isn't happening an adequate amount.", "Only one missing the point is you. The point of the post is \"there is a board in class that was presented as the board for kids that work the hardest and the teacher blatantly said certain kids will not be in consideration for ever going on that board because the teacher doesn't believe they have to work hard to get the grades they get.\" That's not a reason to yell at the teacher but it's ridiculous to think that encourages all kids. No one is saying ops kid should get special treatment. I'm saying she should get equal opportunities. The teacher chose to put the board up. The teacher acknowledges that the daughter does great but refuses to even consider her for the board because she thinks she doesn't have to work to get good grades. That's not okay. No person is born just knowing algebra and the teacher straight up said \"she has no chance of making on the board because I think she just magically knows how to do this stuff already.\"", "No, it doesn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t say teachers should spend one on one time with every student and in fact I said that the teacher can\u2019t possibly be there for everyone individually. I\u2019m referring specifically to the board which is an activity this specific teacher has created that has the potential to create good work ethic and habits to the kids."]}
