After being out of school for almost a decade getting your life in order I'd say your priorities are straight and for an instructor to bring your personal or social life to light in front of the class suggests said instructor does not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo ya NTA and do the right thing", "Annnnnd what was *your instructor* doing in a *bar*, that\u2019s what I wanna know. WTF and NTA\n\nedit to add - Holy none of your instructors damn business what you do in your personal life, Batman!", "NTA, you could report it to the school if you need to. It is zero of her business what you do outside of class.", "NTA go above her, to her bosses and ask them what policy allows her to punish you for your legal actions outside of the classroom. Then ask if she is allowed to publicly bully you for your legal actions outside of the classroom. She\u2019s a teacher at a school you are presumably paying for so she should do her job and keep her opinions to herself.", "NTA. I fail to see how she didn't broach her professional ethics by airing your private (and completely legal) life in front of the class.", "NTA.\n\nAnd you need to go straight to the dean and file a formal complaint.\n\nHad an instructor try to pull this shit with me. Our class was out of town for a convention related to our program. Some of my classmates and I went out that evening for dinner and drinks (all of age, all responsible adults). Ran into our instructor when we went out for drinks. She threatened to kick us out of the program. Told her to f*ck right off and went to the dean who was coincidentally friends with my boss at my part time job\u2026. Needless to say, we were not kicked out of the program\u2026.\n\nYour instructor is way out of line and this bs behavior should not be tolerated.", "NTA. I\u2019m confused why your life outside of school is her business (it really shouldn\u2019t be). Also curious  to know what details and in what manner the instructor at the bar told your math teacher about seeing you in the bar.", "You need to take your complaint up the chain of command. Unless this is some kind of religious school with established no drinking rules that everyone is aware of, that teacher had no business commenting at all, but especially in class. Did the teacher give you the probation or their supervisor? if it's the former, go complain. You aren't in high school. That's unacceptable.", "NTA go up the ladder with this nobody should ever tell you what to do on your own time I'd be livid", "Nta", "Incredibly inappropriate for her to comment on your life outside class, and you should report her.\n\nYour responsibility as a student is to show up to class as much as possible, in a reasonably fit state to learn. How you manage that as an adult is your problem and honestly is not your teacher's business in any way, shape, or matter.", "NTA. Your instructor's behavior is baffling and bizarre. Unless one of my students was drinking underage, I wouldn't look twice at them at a bar, and I most definitely wouldn't call them out in front of their classmates for going out. The fact that she cares to that extent is strange. My advice is to write up a record of the incident and report it to admin. You may also be able to appeal the probation; if you can, see if any of your classmates are willing to corroborate your account.\n\nThe other thing I'll note is that--if you're in the US--this might be considered a FERPA violation. I don't quite know how FERPA translates to technical schools. I teach at a community college and am certainly no lawyer. But I'm not allowed to say/do *anything* that indicates a specific student is performing in any specific way. So implying that Jane is doing poorly in English class because she's going out partying at nightclubs in front of all her classmates? That's majorly unprofessional, but also, the sort of thing that could potentially get me in HUGE trouble because the college might consider that \"sharing private information about a student's academic performance,\" which is explicitly forbidden by FERPA. And even if it wasn't a FERPA violation, it's still something my college would take very seriously because they do *not* want instructors where 'Okay, is this a FERPA violation?' is even a question being asked.\n\nSo if your instructor specifically implied, in front of your classmates, that your performance in her class is subpar because you were at a bar, this might also be a privacy issue that your school wants to take seriously.", "NTA \n \nJust start saying \"teach is just mad I saw get thrown out the bar for offering to blow the bartender for coke.\"", "NTA.  Don't accept probation.  Go above her.  And talk to the dean about harassment.  Make it clear.  That if it doesn't stop.  And they don't do something about it.  You will take it further.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
