She was too far along to terminate when she found out, and needless to say, she\u2019s not ready to be a mom. Her dad reached out to me because he knows that my fianc\u00e9 and I want kids but have fertility problems, and asked us if we would adopt the baby. \n\nWe of course said yes, and met with Emma and her parents several times to talk and prepare all parties for the birth and adoption. During one of these visits, Emma brought up the name of the baby. She said that she wanted the baby\u2019s first name to be after her maternal grandpa, (Let\u2019s say that his name was Michael for example, but it\u2019s a less common name in reality), and that if it was a girl, the feminine version (Literally just the name with a on the end, Michaela in this example). \n\nI would be all for this, if the name wasn\u2019t also the name of my ex-boyfriend, who was abusive. His name still carries a fair bit of trauma for me, I can\u2019t imagine raising a child with that name. I asked her if maybe she could think of another way to honor her grandpa, but she held firm. \n\nI tried to gently explain why I was uncomfortable using that name, but she insisted that the name had nothing to do with my ex. Her father backed her up, and eventually we ran out of time, but I\u2019ve been in contact with them ever since. They both maintain that the name is fine and that I\u2019ll get over it, and my cousin says that Emma should at least have the right to name the kid, since she\u2019s going to give every other aspect of the kid to me and my fianc\u00e9. \n\nWe\u2019ll be the ones to sign the papers at the hospital, so we can technically name the kid whatever we want.

It\u2019s not like you just don\u2019t like the name, it\u2019s a trigger for you. You can keep trying to compromise  on a name, but, in the end, it would be your child and your decision. If a name would be enough for the cousin to back out of the adoption and decide raising a kid at 15 is better just so she can have the name she wants, then let her. If they are going to try to be controlling over a name, be prepared for them to continue this behavior of telling you what you can or can\u2019t do with your child if they allow you to adopt.", "NTA.

There is no way this would work.

It's not like this is her only chance to honor his memory.", "NTA \n\nOnce adopted, it will be your child. You get to choose the name after adoption.  \n\nI suggest you start setting boundaries once child is born though or else they will try to make all decisions for child.", "Be cautious with that. Depending on the county, the both bio parents have to sign away rights for an adoption to legally take place. Look up the laws for your country to make sure you are protected.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re adopting the baby which means the baby will be yours. It\u2019s a tricky situation because it\u2019s family but you will have authority over the child and not your cousin.\n\nI do think you could try and incorporate the name somewhere if it\u2019s special to her.

Or take the grandpa\u2019s middle name instead of first name and use that as your child\u2019s middle name. \n\nI know you said she doesn\u2019t want to compromise but ultimately it will be your child and you shouldn\u2019t have to be reminded of abuse anytime you or anyone else says your child\u2019s name.\n\nBut even if you were to ignore her wishes and name the baby something else completely unrelated without incorporating it at all I still don\u2019t believe you\u2019d be doing anything wrong.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this situation is tainting what should be a really exciting time for you and your husband.

Just because she knows you it\u2019s pretty bold of her to think she can. \n\nI realize Emma is only 15, but she is old enough to understand how adoptions work. You need to reiterate that this child will be yours and your husbands, and that Emma or her mother will not be involved in any decision making in regards to this child. Now or in the future. \n\nThis is why family adoptions are messy.

But if you will be the ones signing the papers, it's up to you. Your second cousin will likely go on to have more children in the future, and can name them.

Really up to you if you want to keep having your cousin as a friend or cut her off completely cause this sounds to be big deal to them maybe not to you.", "NTA, but be aware that this controlling behavior will not end after the papers are signed. Your second cousin is very young and probably will have some trauma related to this event, even if everything goes as smoothly as possible. (I'm not trying to say that adoption is always inherently traumatic, but it does require a lot of emotional bandwidth, and I think that someone so young who didn't make the choice to put the baby up for adoption as opposed to termination, and only is seeking adoption because termination was off the table, is not going to be the best equipped person for this.)\n\nHer dad's not doing her any favors by backing up her behavior. He might think that he's just protecting her by helping her have a wish honored, but the more she feels like she has rights and control over this baby, the harder this will be.\n\nI feel badly for Emma, truly I do, but also, the wellbeing of the baby has to come first, and you need to think seriously about what boundaries you want to have between them and this child, because not maintaining boundaries could be very harmful for the child. If you don't make sure everyone's on the same page, you could be facing years of them trying to make decisions about the baby, and hurt feelings every time something comes up that they disagree with.\n\nI'm not saying 'back out of the adoption,' not at all. But I do think that creating very clear expectations and boundaries is a good thing, especially for what sounds like an open adoption.", "NAH, but this is a difficult situation in which *someone* is going to end up feeling hurt, no matter what you do.\n\nYou might compromise by including the name as either a first or second name, and then make another name the one that you use everyday. Lots of people go by their second names; I have all my life.\n\nOr, gently explain to her that one day she's going to have a child she'll be able to raise herself, and she might want to reserve the name that means so much to her for that child. See if that gets her to relent.", "This is a lose lose situation, and the only\nAH really is Emma\u2019s father who is not showing either of you compassion. Emma is going through something incredibly traumatic and it sounds like she is not fully prepared for what it means to give up her child. She has a right to name the child maybe morally, but legally that\u2019s not the case. You have legitimate trauma behind that name and deserve to raise your child without that attached baggage. If Emma isn\u2019t understanding the gravity of the situation (this is not her baby once you adopt), this whole adoption will be a traumatic mess from start to finish.", "If these are people that you see regularly in their lives I think this is a terrible, horrible idea.\n\nYour nieces brain is 10 years from being fully developed. So for the next 10 years she\u2019s gonna be acting the fool and putting all kinds of BS into this mix.\n\nMy daughter had a friend from church and I knew the parents and family well.

Are you allowed to name the baby whatever you want? Sure\n\nDoes it completely steamroll over the fact that this is a child your niece has carried to term, has struggled and cried and had fears over before ultimately deciding this was the best decision? Yes it does. Does it denounce the fact that she wants to give her child a little piece of her side of the family and her memory to know they are loved? It kind of does.\n\nDoing what you want for yourself will mean YTA to your niece. Sometimes we have to be AHs to other people to do what's best for us. Being an AH doesn't mean you can't do it. It just means you'll have to face the fallout.", "This is tough. I want to say NTA. In the end, the baby will be yours and you have every right to name it as you please. I don\u2019t see not wanting to name the baby after an abusive ex as selfish if it\u2019s something that will continue to trigger you. Considering your cousin is only 15 she likely can\u2019t fully grasp the complexity of trauma and what it means to you. Could you make it a middle name instead? I think you should try to keep talking to them about this and help them see it from your point of view better.", "NTA. Jesus no one but you and your partner have naming rights.", "Be honest. And tell her why you don't want your child to have that name. If you don't mind her picking one of the names, tell her that you would be honored to have her choose a name, just not thst one. But I personally make it the middle name unless you end up really loving her second choice.", "Yes ywbta. Currently it is her child and will be until adoption is finalized. Her wishes on the name should be respected. \n\nGive her the info of contacting a group called saving our sisters. They can help her determine if she needs resources and supports to keep and parent her own child or if adoption is really the best route for her and her child. \n\nBeing at the hospital when the child is born is incredibly predatory, you will likely have the child for the next 18 years, give her and the baby that little bit of time alone. \n\nI highly recommend you consider joining the Facebook group called adoption: facing realities.

You have the power to change how you feel about the name with this baby. Don\u2019t let your ex still hold power over you by his name, instead you have the chance to create something beautiful.
