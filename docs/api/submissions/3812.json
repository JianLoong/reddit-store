I was at my grandma\u2019s visiting today and she showed me her draft of the letter. In the letter she mentions my sister\u2019s relapse into meth addiction and how the family has been so strong in such a hard time, no mention of my sister other than \u2018X relapsed back into methamphetamine use and it has hurt US so badly\u2019. My sister is not my favorite, I wish she would get the help she needs, and yes, it has been hard, but I don\u2019t feel that needs to be detailed in a letter sent to every single family member, some distant who don\u2019t know she\u2019s an addict/relapsed. I also know my sister would see this and would be insanely hurtful to her, and cause her to further pull away from us who are trying to keep her trust so we can help when she\u2019s ready. \n\nSo I gently advised my grandma to maybe not put that into the letter, that she doesn\u2019t realize how badly it could affect my sister. My grandma got offended I\u2019m trying to tell her what to do and that everyone deserves to know the truth. I agree, if anyone asks me about my sister I am honest, but I don\u2019t see how volunteering that information is going to beneficial to anyone. If anything it means family who aren\u2019t involved could get nosy and start trying to get the gossip from us and that would just cause more stress and drama.

She can easily reference trying times without getting specific.", "Nta, that absolutely should not be included in a letter.  It is a huge attack on your sister that would only do damage.  \n\nTalk with your parents and others in the family and coordinate an intervention on grandma. Everyone in your immediate family needs to put their foot down on this.", "Nta. Your sisters addiction isn\u2019t your grandmas Christmas sob story. It doesn\u2019t give her anything by sharing it other than sympathy from people as emotionally stunted as she is. If she does this, because I am petty as fuck, I would send out your own Christmas letter, detailing how your grandmas behavior has *changed* and it\u2019s affected *all of us* and that you\u2019d like to get a prayer chain going because you hope this isn\u2019t leading into a serious diagnosis, and that everyone should disregard her letter", "NTA\n\nTell her I said she should feel embarrassed and ashamed for doing this.", "NTA.  I would quit telling Grandma personal items if she is going to send it out in a newsletter to all corners of the world.  She has no boundaries.  Maybe your mom or dad would know how to talk to her.", "NTA for sure, but your grandma is TA. Sounds like she\u2019s after what, pity?? I\u2019m sure this situation is hard on your family but I agree with what you said, if your sister sees this she will likely be very hurt and not want to reach out for help. The extended family could ask some pretty triggering questions if they get in touch with her, and if she doesn\u2019t see the newsletter that could be a shock to her to realize they know. \n\nAlso sounds like you said you gently advised so I\u2019m assuming it was a calm suggestion and not you yelling at your grandma so yea, NTA", "NTA \n\nThat is an... odd choice, to say the least.\n\nShe couldn't edit that, even just a little bit? \"Sister is going through tough times but we are all here for her and each other\" would be better than \"Sister's relapsed into her methamphetamine addiction, but anyway happy holidays\"\n\nFeels kinda punitive, like she's upset with your sister for relapsing or something. Maybe I'm off base on that, either way NTA", "NTA. Sounds like grandma is using your sister\u2019s relapse to gather sympathy points from other relatives. Or she\u2019s just a giant gossip.", "NTA.\n\nYour grandmother is being an AH, though.  Nothing like kicking your sister when she's already down.", "NTA-Your sister\u2019s addiction doesn\u2019t need to be blabbed to everyone. You can write the truth without sharing everything especially if it hurts someone.", "NTA. That information should not be shared out widely and distant relatives don't need to know that. You should actually be a little more forceful in your objection and tell your Grandma that is a huge violation. My brother is an addict and although I have gone NC with him I would still not allow that to be put in a Christmas letter.", "NTA. Ask her how the hell that relates to Christmas or what her end goal in mentioning it is. Hell, ask if she thinks drugs are a part of Christmas, since she wants to tell the truth so badly.\n\nSeems like an ulterior motive is going on, here.", "NTA", "Nta\n\nCan't imagine if my grandma was like this and told everyone a out all the miscarriages I'd had when trying to conceive.", "NTA, there's plenty of ways to say that part of the family is going through a difficult time right now without being so specific. Also sounds like grandma is more interested in fishing for sympathy than being the fount of important family news.", "NTA literally why are boomers like this", "NTA. Your grandmother wants to play the victim and get sympathy.", "Grandma is the A for making your sister's addiction all about how SHE feels. NTA at all.", "NTA, and Grandma apparently comes from the old school of cruelty. Rubbing someone's nose in addiction is not only rude, but extremely counterproductive to helping them break the cycle.", "NTA", "NTA.  I feel like the fact that she specifically made it about how hard it's been for everyone else besides your sister is what makes it especially inappropriate to include.  I also don't think everyone is entitled to know that information if it doesn't directly affect them, and gossiping about someone's substance abuse disorder is in poor taste.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your family if experiencing this. Grandma is in the wrong on this. It serves no purpose but to humiliate and hurt your sister and your family.", "NTA.  Your grandma is so beyond clueless.", "NTA, sucks you\u2019re so much more mature than your elder relative but you\u2019re def right on this one. The only reason to include that info is to shame your sister (which won\u2019t help w her addiction struggles) and to gain sympathy for herself.", "NTA, its goof too look after your family and your nan needs to respect boundaries", "NTA. This isn't something to be shared to everyone.", "NTA at all... sounds like grandma is very inconsiderate...\n\nMaybe consider telling your mom/dad/others to talk to her as well... if she hears it from a few people, hopefully she'll reconsider...", "NTA\n\nAnd I agree that Grandma needs to receive limited information from now on since anything you tell her in confidence is obviously broadcast to the world \n\nMaybe Grandma needs to be reminded that if she ever wants to have a relationship with her granddaughter in recovery breaking her trust is not the way to go about it and how would she like it if people aired her dirty laundry? \n\nUltimately you can\u2019t stop your grandmother doing whatever she wants to do but make it clear you won\u2019t be part of any drama and if any relative calls you wanting further details just say \u201cSorry I won\u2019t discuss that with you\u201d", "Nta.", "You're NTA.

It\u2019s controlling behavior.", "agreed", "I have her on an \u2018information diet\u2019 and so do most of our family.

I love this.", "I personally have her on an information diet since she\u2019s such a freaking gossip. I was struggling with some personal things at one point and reached out for comfort. Two days later my sisters are like \u2018sooo grandma told us this are you okay??\u2019\n\nSadly my sister\u2019s relapse is very visible.", "I\u2019m not downplaying her addiction issues, if anyone asks about my sister I just say I haven\u2019t seen her lately so I don\u2019t know, if I\u2019m asked why I just say she relapsed and leave it at that. I just don\u2019t feel it\u2019s something we need cousin Susie twice removed to read and possibly (probably, with how nosy our family is) to come sniffing around for the gossip", "But has the GM asked the affected granddaughter for consent to write about this? This is a personal matter. The only reason it's not private, is because it's visible and because it affects the people closest to the person with substance abuse. Family members who are not part of this inner circle are not entitled to information. People who already know what's happening are also not allowed by default to spread all the info.  \n\n\nThen there's the way it was written. Could've just mentioned difficult times. And it feels as if it's about how the fam members are affected and not the actual person with the substance abuse. It's difficult for both, so again, could just mention difficult times.", "Old folks move into that Zero Fucks Given territory and while it can be occasionally awesome to witness, it also tends to amplify their worst traits.

This is not something that needs to be in that letter.  I understand your grandma is hurting but there are support groups for family and friends of addicts and therapists for her to talk to about this.  Broadcasting it to people that don\u2019t need to know about it is only going to push your sister further away.", "I'm gonna go with a probably unpopular NAH.\n\n- it's fair you want to protect your sister\n\nBut\n\n- it's the yearly occasion your grandmother has to keep in touch with some relatives and she shouldn't have to restrain what she wants to talk about. She should be able to talk about the good and the bad without having to censor things which are true but you'd prefer to stay hidden.\n\nPlus, it's her letter, not yours.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA, but sounds like your grandma is going to leave it in the letter anyway.

This is not a typical \u2018truth\u2019 and therefore does NOT need to be shared with the world or known by all. This is your sisters vulnerable life and the family letter should not be a paper that airs the family\u2019s dirty laundry. She should go by the reasonable test: Is it true? Is it helpful? Is it kind? While it may be \u2018true\u2019, technically, it\u2019s not HER truth to share. And it isn\u2019t helpful for someone who could relapse. And it isn\u2019t kind to point out another\u2019s flaws to the public.", "NTA.", "NTA.  My MIL enjoys sending out Christmas letters also.  It mostly refers to what she and FIL have done.  She does mention her grandkids, but only how proud she is of all of them."]}
