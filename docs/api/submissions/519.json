Also, English is not my first language.\n\nSo, I (27F) work in the male dominated industry, the company I work for has a lot of extra activities for employees, like sports. \n\nI was lucky to work from home for the past year since I have kinda bad anxiety around people I don't know and I'm absolutely terrified of being touched by strangers (like nervous stomach type), but I really love playing sports so I'm regular in the gym and on some of the sports activities company offers. Also, worth of mentioning that some of my good friends work in the same company and attend same events and activities and I'm absolutely sticking with them.\n\nThe issue starts where some of the colleagues started contacting me through the company channels in the work time, usually asking me about which sports I played and where (I figured that they're just making friends since we're colleagues after all and I WFH), but I was so wrong since some of those colleagues started writing semi-sexual messages at first and I was giving them the benefit of the doubt since they're married with small kids or engaged so I mostly ignored them or stated that their behavior is disgusting (not US, so the culture is very familly oriented). Even my friends and I condemned his sexual comments multiple times during the activities, especially because he's like 10-15 years older then us.\n\nSo, during one of the games, that colleague had a medical issue and since I usually bring the first aid with me and know how to treat wounds, I ran up to him to try and help him (would do that to anyone). During that time he made few sexual comments and connotations which made me disgusted and friends and I called him out for that.\n\nMain issue is that a colleague sent a mail to all of the employees praising me for helping him during the sports game. If I may say that email was full of sexual conotations and it made me disgusted to the core, concerning the nature of the messages I received from that person and his previos behavior. I'm not sure what triggered him to behave that way or to do so, but he went out of his way to do this in front of the whole company. Even my friends reached out to point out how sly and sexual it was. I spent the rest of the day crying and deeply disturbed. So WIBTA if I report him to the HR? This is not his first offense so he may be fired, he has a small child and i think his wife is SAHM, so I'm doubting myself a lot.", "created_utc": 1667125435, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhay7a/wibta_if_i_report_my_work_collegue/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bringing someone's harassment to authority so they can face proper consequences for _their own purposeful and mindful action_ is not something to feel guilty over. Not facing consequences for it allows it to go on longer (never good), makes work places much cruddier for everyone involved until it stops, and really, reflects poorly on people who stand by knowingly allowing it to happen.\n\nIf he gets fired, that's his own fault, not the person who reports him.", "NTA - he\u2019s relying on you being \u201ctoo nice\u201d to lose him his job but really it\u2019s his own behaviour that will get him in trouble, not you reporting it.\n\nHis wife and child are not your responsibility; and if he was thinking of their wellbeing then he wouldn\u2019t behave this way to you.\n\nIf his wife finds out she married a creep then she will be justifiably angry with him but again that has nothing to do with you and is a situation of his creation.", "NTA\n\nReport him as soon as possible, he doesn't learn when comments are made about it so hopefully he learns this way!", "Nta.

NTA.", "NTA, but if up to this point the offensive stuff has been almost all texts & emails (nothing physical, no grabbing, no threats) do the following before you call HR. \n\n1. Do not delete any of the texts and emails. Print out the worst ones. Make sure the dates are on them.\n2.  Get a copy of the HR policy that forbids sexual harassment.\n3. Think of someone in your company that can help you plan what to do. Best person would be someone older and two or more steps more senior, and not close friends with the harassers. Ask them if they know of any previous cases, whether the woman complained, and what happened to her to the men she complained about.\n4. Think about what you want from this job in this company. Do you generally like the company. Can you imagine trying to get promotions and advance? Or is this just a temporary paycheck for a couple of years.\n5. How many men harassed you? Was this a problem with two men, or do you think it will continue by other men even if those 2 stop because this is simply ordinary behavior in the company?\n6. Think about what you want to happen to the men who harassed you. Do you simply want them to leave you alone or do you want revenge? AITA redditors love drama and revenge and those who will advise you to cause maximum drama and maximum harm regardless of consequences to yourself will be upvoted. \n7. You cannot go to HR just for venting and sympathy. It is possible that HR will do nothing, but more likely that HR will feel they need to respond to your report by doing something that might range from warning the men to firing them.\n8. Do you want them dealt with by HR or senior management? Once you turn this over to HR or senior management you will have no control over what happens to them. They might be fired. Their wives might find out and family life would worsen for both the man and wife and the children. You might make some enemies who think what you did was far worse than what they saw as simply jokes.\n9. Possible consequences to you are that senior management might think of you as a troublemaker, and you go no farther in the company or they even begin to make things unpleasant so you leave. People who don't even know you will know you as the woman who complained. It may change the way men in the company treat you. There may be fewer offensive jokes and innuendo made directly to you, but more jokes and false stories spread among other employees.  Some women may admire you and support you and others may admire you but keep silent.  \n10. If you think the culture of your company or your whole country is misogynistic and you can change it by loudly complaining, with no harm to yourself, you may be in for a frustrating experience. \n\nThen you have some choices. I cannot tell you what to do but here are some choices.\n\n1. You could wait until something else happens. Or if the events you describe are recent you could act now.\n2. You could copy into an email the relevant HR policy about harassment, send it to the harassers with a simple message like: No more jokes about me or I will take this to HR and management.\n3. You could go to HR but if so, do it with as much documentation as possible.\n4. You could start with your own manager and ask for advice and guidance. Some companies have a policy that an employee should first notify their own manager about a problem. Follow your company's policy.", "NTA he's sexually harassing you, and you do NOT want to find put if he'll go further. Report him.", "NTA, and report him right now. If you say nothing, he's likely to harrass other women.\n\nYou already called him out, stated that his comments made you feel uncomfortable and he blatantly ignored your boundaries.

There lies so much of my dilemma. I've seen guys getting slap on the wrist before, so I was unsure what to do. I've had more then dozen questional experiences with several colleagues. Some of them included groping, some of them included them writing innapropriate stuff to the chat app. The horror lies in there that, that particular email went through HR and no one raised an eyebrow. I mean innuendo is there. I wrote in another comment, imagine you applying cooling gel onto injured hand and the guy straight up wrote 'she was rubbing me for a while'.... My heart breaks at this because I just wanted to help and now I'm being sexualized.\n\n I have all the evidence, for multiple occasions, I'm not sure why I'm being targeted by these people, I'm an introvert. I didn't want to report this so far because I thought 'ok I WFH so they can't reach me, I can work in peace' (I really love my work and I work on fun stuff so I like it like that), and I didn't want to rock the boat since, as you mentioned, I'd be the culprit for this kind of behavior.

Get a lawyer and sue him/them plus the company. Do NOT talk to anyone but the lawyer. Save every message sent on paper and digital 2-3 times.

Make sure you print a copy to keep, and forward it to HR when you make your report.", "One of the issues is that email went through HR, as I said the guy is really sly, people who know him personally PMd me with how sexual it was. That's what concerns me honestly and baffles me, my mom also said it seems ok, but I'm sick to my stomach. Have it like this: I had to rub the cooling gel onto the hand, and he straight up wrote in that email 'she rubbed me for a while', honestly, disgusting.", "You can phrase it in such a way that you can say that you felt uncomfortable with the way it was phrased, and that there\u2019s a context of other messages which were similarly loaded, and you can request that he use language that doesn\u2019t have multiple interpretations in future. He could just as easily not have give a detailed account of what happened, or been much clearer in what he meant. Even if he claims not to have meant it that way or says you\u2019re being too sensitive, once he knows it\u2019s upsetting to you, and that you\u2019ll report it, it\u2019s much harder for him to justify doing it again when it\u2019s completely avoidable."]}
