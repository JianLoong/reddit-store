On her death bed she will realize how shitty of a person and mom she was. Because even though she\u2019s doing this for the new kids she\u2019s not doing it for them or for you.

Sounds like she was not ready for kids when she had you, and I'm sorry you had to deal with the consequences. I can say as a Dad myself, your Dad would be very proud of how you stood up for him and yourself and didn't let her sweep him under the rug.

Hard to argue OP has no justification for that. If she doesn't plan to, she needs to calmly and expressly lay out the actual issue. She neglected her in childhood and continues to do it now and actually being more than an absent and neglectful mother to her second family does more harm to her than good because it just shows her she was capable of it, but just didn't want to with her and nothing has changed. It says that it was always her and her dad and not that she actually changed. It will be rough to do, but its necessary if she wants to not have a person in her life that will cause nothing but grief.

Harsh. You just wanted to inflict pain. All of this was immature to say, get therapy instead. None of the short term satisfaction you got from this outburst solved the problem.", "At the risk of being downvoted. I will say this: The world of adults isn't always so simple \n\nThe relationship between your dad and your mom had probably been going downhill for a long time.\n\nJust because he was a good dad doesn't mean he was a good husband too. \n\nThey clearly didn't love each other very much by the end. And her resistance to you was likely just a manifestation of that.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying she totally faultless, she's definitely an asshole.\n\nAnd you are definitely entitled to feel what you feel\n\nI'm just saying things ain't always so black and white", "it could be the image of her having a daughter who wont talk to her makes her look bad to the other parents that she now associates with. These kind of people are often image obsessed.", "Sorry you went through that! I know what it was like to be forgotten. Though I now believe it wasn't that she forgot. It was that she never intended to follow through for me anyway.", "That's part of the plan. But it will be entirely away from her and everyone around her. I'll focus on my life and my family and the family I want to build myself.", "I don't really feel alone now. I have my uncle and his family and they have been so good to me. I could never bring myself to try or want a relationship with her kids. They're just not my family. Even if she did screw them over and we were in the same boat some day, I consider dad my only parent and an only child because he had no other kids. The blood stuff for me doesn't matter as much. Maybe because my uncle was my dad's best friend and not his biological brother.", "On brand for this sub, place blame on the (now dead no less) man. Oh it just had to have been his fault this woman was a shitty mother.", "I'm not mad at them really. I just have zero interest in them or having them in my life.", "She did not change for me. She not once tried to be there for me. Her life continued on as if I was not there. I was simply expected to cheer her on for that.\n\nAt one time dad loved her. I truly believe he hated her guts when he died. I do not believe he would be happy for her when she never did right by me. She only did what she wanted to do at the end of the day.", "Holy shit this is absolutely vile you should be ashamed of yourself. You jump through this many hoops to exonerate deadbeat dads? I think not", "I'm 18 and they are under 6\n\nI'm not their big sister. I don't want a relationship with them now or in the future. Just because there's biology does not mean we are family. I only had one parent in my life, my dad and he has no other kids so I am an only child.", "Whats your goal in asking these questions? She was a shitty mom and spouse, the man she made miserable is now dead so whats the point of examining the whys?", "She likely also doesn't like that OP told her do over husband about her treatment of OP and their dad", ">and I understand why you'd share with your experience\n\nshe said she understood why you shared.", "This just makes you sound like you're being insanely pedantic for no specific reason.\n\nObviously it's clear what OP is saying when they say that they aren't his/her siblings, so why do you need to come in with the \"um actually...\"?", "That was my first thought too. ED doesn't want a relationship, she wants a babysitter. My guess is that she wanted to take care of these kids about as much as she wanted to take care of you. She may also know that if she doesn't tow the line step-dad will leave her. There is an alterior motive for sure. She either wants something or is afraid to lose something.", "Everyone is just saying what she wants to hear. I think she\u2019s being TA to her siblings and denying any relation to them or her mom is immature, petty, and not going to help her move on, but hey just go ahead and downvote me."]}
