On her death bed she will realize how shitty of a person and mom she was. Because even though she\u2019s doing this for the new kids she\u2019s not doing it for them or for you.

Sounds like she was not ready for kids when she had you, and I'm sorry you had to deal with the consequences. I can say as a Dad myself, your Dad would be very proud of how you stood up for him and yourself and didn't let her sweep him under the rug.

Hard to argue OP has no justification for that. If she doesn't plan to, she needs to calmly and expressly lay out the actual issue. She neglected her in childhood and continues to do it now and actually being more than an absent and neglectful mother to her second family does more harm to her than good because it just shows her she was capable of it, but just didn't want to with her and nothing has changed. It says that it was always her and her dad and not that she actually changed. It will be rough to do, but its necessary if she wants to not have a person in her life that will cause nothing but grief.
