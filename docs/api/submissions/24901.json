The estate came with (2) vehicles. Due to inherence laws I have no rights to his inheritance, I understand that, however prior to him inheriting the property the original house burnt down so the actual value of the property was only $205K. We as a family the two of us took (4) years of weekends to rebuild the house from scratch so the property value increased to $450K.  We also helped clean up after a flood on the 5th year.  Unfortunately my father-in-law passed away at the end of the 5th year (11/2022) Now my husband wants a divorce not even a year after his father passed away.  We have been married for 27 years.  We only have a business worth $30,000 and no marital assets other than (4) vans and (1) car. I own ( 2) of the vans and car, but (1) van is scrap and the car has issues. I've been a housewife and helped in the business physically for the last 24 years. He recently left a month ago and took my van saying it was a marital asset leaving me with the car that has issues. He now has three reliable vehicles. I need to get a job so I can support myself and the business but he refuses to give me access to my van so I can have a reliable vehicle so I can wor (he doesn't even have a driver's license  but he drives anyway). The business makes no money yet, but it keeps a roof over my head.  He is trying to call me greedy for wanting 1/2 of the increase in property value that I helped with, minus buying the business from him. He would walk with $492500 in assests and 5 vehicles.
