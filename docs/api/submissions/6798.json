They came a little early and we had to rush to the hospital where we got assigned a midwife. A male midwife I have to add.   \nHe was honestly great. My child was somehow not positioned the right way in my womb to come out and there was the threat I would have to get a c-section. But my midwife told me to get into a few positions like on my knees and hands to help my child turn itself and it worked! He was also very calm the whole time, compassionate and calmed me down a lot. Meanwhile he joked with my husband and in between delivered the baby of another woman before I was ready to deliver my child naturally. It was overall a great experience and I have to thank my midwife a lot.  \n\n\nNow I am the first in my friendgroup to deliver my baby and there are three friends who are pregnant aswell but not so far along. (All between 3rd and 7th month with their first child)  \nWhen I got home from the hospital we had a little get together after a few days to celebrate the birth of my baby. At this occasion I talked a lot about my experience with my friends who all were very curious about it. I also praised my midwife a lot. The thing is, I never talked about the midwife being male as there isn't really a distinction between male and female midwifes in my language and I also wasn't paying attention as I was excited and talked about the birth, gushing over my baby in between. \n\nI recommended the midwife as in our country midwifes do their service at hospitals but often also offer their services pre and post birth aswell. A friend of mine asked for the mailing adress. \n\nYesterday she came over and blew up at me. She made an appointment with my midwife and only realised he is male when she and her husband arrived to the appointment to talk about arrangements regarding her own delivery. After the meeting her husband was elated, was talking about how much he liked this midwife compared to the other ones they have met. She had to agree on most things he brought up like availability, price, and how they clicked. Her husband also said it was a huge plus that they knew from me, that the midwife was also professional and knew what he did. She said she still didn't want him as her midwife. Her husband was floored and asked her why. She had to admit it was, because the midwife is male. He called her sexist afterwards. She then called our friends who are also expecting and they sided with her husband. Thats why she blew up at me. Had she known that the midwife was male, she would have ruled him out right away and wouldn't even made an appointment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for recommending a male midwife?", "created_utc": 1673176322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106grmu/aita_for_recommending_a_male_midwife/", "score": 989, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn\u2019t ask her to sign a contract.", "NTA\n\nI can kind of understand wanting a doctor of a certain gender for such an intimate procedure. When it's to do with genitalia I think it should depend on the person's comfort, some women prefer women and some men will prefer men for their procedures. I think that's okay.", "NTA You recommended a midwife who you felt extremely comfortable and helped you feel comfortable whilst going through labour.\nYour friends husband and other friends are all right because your friends the one whose being TA here.", "NTA because you didn't think the gender mattered so that's why you didn't mention it.  Maybe it was a mistake for not thinking it *might* make a difference but making a mistake is not the same as being an AH.", "NTA, and she even agreed to most points her husband made that he is a great midwife. I also wouldn't know that there is a male term for it. I mean in english midhusband is not really a term. One would say a male midwife.", "NTA! \n\nI had a male midwife for one of my births and OMG he was amazing! Unfortunately he didn't work privately, only through the hospital, wish I could have had him for all 4 of them. The females I did have were all good in their own ways but the male beat them hands down in every single way. \n\nI get having a preference - but - as someone who's gone from everything is fine to everything is getting fucked up and it goes from ok to scary fast, I didn't care who was up in my business, I just wanted wverything to be okay with my baby.", "Definitely not. I would say she\u2019s TA for blowing up at you but I can\u2019t be mad at her for just being uncomfortable with a male midwife. Childbirth is very vulnerable and if she would be uncomfortable with a guy midwife that\u2019s fine. What\u2019s not fine is being mad that you would dare to recommend one. It\u2019s not like you knew she had this preference!", "NTA, I mean it\u2019s her preference I guess but getting mad at someone for trying to give helpful advice is an asshole move. You could\u2019ve mentioned it from beginning, but an equal effort could\u2019ve been made on their end also. It\u2019s not like you should\u2019ve been expected to know they didn\u2019t want a male midwife.

You felt safe, trusted your midwife and you and baby are both well, so of course you recommended that particular health professional.\nYour friend might have been a bit taken aback as male midwives are in the minority, but to rule him out straight away rather than take the time to get used to the idea is short-sighted.", "I had a male midwife and I recommended him to everyone. He was amazing and so calming. He was also on night duty after my daughter was born and she would only settle with him. My husband liked him too as he didn't feel so out of place in appointments with him.", "I think you know that you're NTA for recommending a male midwife. Male, female, otherwise...Doesn't matter. You recommended someone you felt was a great option. You're not responsible for her issue with it.", "NTA why is it so important to let her know the gender if she had not told you before hand that she was not comfortable around man during delivery? Also it is totally understandable that she would not want another man in her most vulnerable moment\u2026 delivering a baby can be very ugly and a lot of women feel more comfortable among other women. Blowing out at you it\u2019s not the way to go. She should talk to her husband about it", "NTA but her reaction is obviously understandable. There are many reasons a woman might not wish to have a male midwife. There are other women who don't mind. But considering the rarity of men in this particular profession, did it really not occur to you to give her a heads up ahead of time?", "NTA but indeed you could have said so before. A lot of women are more comfortable with female midwives/obgyn etc... I don't necessarily understand, but as birth is a very vulnerable moment for women, I think they should be surrounded by people they trust. And we don't know what kind of trauma she could have been through either.\n\nPersonally I trust competent people though. I understand as well people calling your friend sexist because it's definitely a sexist discrimination.", "NTA. That\u2019s 100% and issue with your friend. She\u2019s hormonal don\u2019t forget and in a vulnerable state so this isn\u2019t to say she\u2019s an absolute sexist, she may just be anxious and a male midwife in a female dominated role may not have been what she expected when she imagined her \u201cperfect birth\u201d.", "NTA you just gave a professional recommendation", "Absolutely NTA!\n\nIf it's that important to your friend then it's her responsibility to find a midwife that she's comfortable with. You had no way of knowing what her preferences were. \n\nI hope it doesn't cause too great a rift in your friendship and that you can find a way forward. Good luck and congratulations on the birth of your child!", "NTA at all for your suggestion and your friend shouildnt have went off on you.\n\nBut she isn't sexist for her opinion and HER BOUNDARY that she doesn't want a male midwife.", "NTA, but the huge majority of people would assume a midwife to be female, so it would be wise/considerate to include that information in the future.", " NAH- I think most people think of midwives as all women so it\u2019s not surprising that she wasn\u2019t comfortable. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re going to have someone in and out of your vagina for multiple hours, most women would like that to be another woman, obviously it worked for you so that\u2019s great! I\u2019m not seeing how it\u2019s odd that she doesn\u2019t want a dude as her midwife. \n\nIm surprised at the comments, it\u2019s totally not wild to not want a man to be handling your mostly naked vulnerable body, especially in front of your partner.", "NAH. Your friend is not to blame as well. Maybe she isn't really a sexist, it's just a matter of her comfort level. The way I understood it, she blew up after the appointment and not really in front of the midwife. That means she was still respectful. \n\nShe's pregnant, I don't think you, your friends, and her husband should be too hard on her and convince her deliberately that she must accept the male midwife. If she's not really comfortable, it's not good for her and her baby to be dreading over things like this.\n\nEDIT: Reading the N T A comments saying that the friend is the AH because of her reaction afterwards made me want to stick on my original judgment.\n\nI think you should consider placing yourself to the situation of your friend. She had no idea that it was a male midwife which she doesn't prefer. However, her husband is fine with it which I guess made her conflicted and feel invalidated with her feeling of discomfort. \n\nThis explains why she subsequently asked for other validation through your friends. But then again, all of you just focused on the fact that she declined because the midwife is a male, rather on finding out why does she not want a male midwife. At the end, your friend blew up to you. Kinda rude, but I think it's just because she's feeling frustrated.", "NTA. Unless your friend\u2019s sexism is universal and well-known, it wasn\u2019t your duty to anticipate her bias. It wasn\u2019t your duty to anticipate her husband\u2019s enthusiasm, and her inability to communicate her discomfort to him. Nor are you responsible for her other friends\u2019 reaction to her sexism. She sounds like she\u2019s got a bunch of problems, none of which you\u2019re responsible for, and she\u2019s looking to blame you for them.", "NTA , but I feel like most women are uncomfortable at the idea of like, male gynecologists.\n\nEven as a dude, I look at dudes who get into delicate medical professions kinda funny.", "I mean NAH because I understand where your friend is coming from. Giving birth is a very vulnerable thing and ig your friend doesn't feel comfortable being around a man at that moment. Many women, especially the older ones prefer a female surgeon/doctors for female specific issues due to the same reason. I don't believe that's sexism. But she shouldn't be going after you for this. That's an AH move but she's probably overwhelmed and she's pregnant, not your fault though.", "NTA. This is your friend\u2019s problem, and it is of her making. \n\nWomen can doctor men. Men can doctor women. \n\nMaybe she\u2019d prefer having a less-competent, non-recommended midwife who happens to be female? Seems ludicrous to me, but I guess she has a mental picture of a midwife that this guy just doesn\u2019t fit\u2026 because of his penis. \n\nI honestly can\u2019t believe that we are still having this conversation.", "NTA and your \"friend\" IS sexist", "NTA\n\nHer sexist views are not your issue, neither does it change the quality of, what honestly sounds like, an amazing and highly qualified midwife. Don't let her get into your head with her - tbh - outdated and sexist opinions, you did nothing wrong", "NTA but I would be interested to know if she\u2019s refused male OBGYNs too", "If she didn\u2019t specify that she\u2019d only be comfortable with a female midwife, she has no reason to be upset with you.", "NTA\n\nI wonder how she even got pregnant", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But she's the one who'll be delivering the baby so it's obviously important that she's comfortable with the person that's helping her do it. And if she doesn't feel comfortable with males then that's valid. Although I guess she is a bit of an ah for blowing up at you about it, but maybe she actually thought you intentionally left out that he's male.

Communicating your comfort level in a hospital in a *respectful* way is always important to do. **But she didn't do that.**\n\nHer reaction and how she handled it? Blowing up at the friend and being completely unreasonable? **That made it cross the line to sexist.**\n\n\"I'm not super comfortable with a male midwife, thanks for the suggestion though!\" = Fine, a little outdated mindset, but hey- people have different comfort levels. \n\n\"How dare you send me to a *man*!\" = Not Fine, totally sexist and rude to OP on top of that.", "I think that her discomfort by itself is not inherently \"sexist,\" since many hetero women have social/religious/traumatic reasons for not being comfortable with men down there.

I just don't think \"discomfort\" as an isolated emotion should be seen as sexist or problematic, especially in something as sensitive and terrifying as childbirth. **But the friend certainly used her discomfort as an excuse to be sexist and problematic.**", "Wow, you should re-evaluate this. Male gynecologist is a perfectly normal thing and it shouldn't be seen as \"delicate\" because they are professionals who look at bodies with the medical view. Honestly I applaud male midwives as this is such an understaffed profession and everyone getting into this hard work is awesome.

Huge bummer.", "Imagine thinking a vagina is delicate", "I'm assuming it's not about competency, but about her level of comfort.

Edited to add that there are many social/religious/traumatic reasons why hetero women would not want a male midwife or gyno, which is why I say her discomfort *by itself* is not sexist.\n\n\"How dare you send me to a *man*!\" *Proceeds to blow up on OP for daring to recommend a male midwife* = Not Fine, now the friend has made it about the fact that the guy is a man, and is offended at the fact that someone would suggest him. **That is sexist** and totally unfair to any medical professional. \n\nHer discomfort by itself, an isolated emotion, is not the problem here. Her using that discomfort to behave in a sexist manner is completely inappropriate and wrong.", "People just be saying anything", "happy cake day!", "I absolutely, 100% agree!

I see male docs all the time but would not pick a male ob/gyn, unless the situation gave me no choice (then I would deal). That doesn\u2019t make me sexist.

There's many valid reasons, most very personal, some very sad, that one may feel this way. One may not wish to disclose those, even to a spouse. I speak from experience.

She was shouting not because the midwife was male, but because OP *didn't warn her in advance* that he was male which put the friend in a position to be shamed, bullied and scolded for not wanting a male midwife.  Which could have been easily avoided.  However the story is probably not true.  How do you talk about someone without using a pronoun once.  How do you talk about this midwife without using the word \"he\" or \"him\" once.  So I think this story is fake.", "Super common and super socially acceptable.

A male midwife is not a negative thing. Maybe the pronoun was used but the friend failed to catch it. Idk i dont care.\n\nMy point being simple. This is sexist and should be called out."]}
