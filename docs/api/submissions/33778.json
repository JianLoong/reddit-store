You've not only built your own life around her, you've demanded that your older daughter does, too. I can understand the pain your older daughter probably feels that you won't even consider putting her first this time. Frankly, it seems like coming in second has probably been most -- if not all -- of her life experience. I have all the compassion in the world for you as a mother in this situation, OP. But you need to check into reality here, and fast. I don't personally have high hopes that you're going to change the order of your list of priorities, so I'll just put it this way: you know you won't be around forever, so what's going to happen to younger daughter at Christmas when you're gone? You're setting her up for even more of a Christmas clusterfuck by continuing to alienate her big sister. Her big sister who is either feeling at least some level of bitterness over her apparent unimportance in your eyes, or has become so conditioned to this whole setup that she doesn't even realize how broken she is.

It has to be Christmas morning at our childhood home, forever, and I think the comments saying you are TA for not treating your children \"equally\" on this front truly don't understand what it's like to have a more severely autistic person in the family. There's no \"equal\" here and those of us with the ability to be more flexible just have to. \n\nThat said, clearly the older daughter wants you to come around the holidays, so if you're saying you can never come a few days later either because you need weeks to recover from the physical strain of Christmas in your home...that's horrible for you too, if you're injuring yourself at that level every year.

Your disabled daughter can't understand why you're favoring her over her older sister.  But your older daughter certainly understands that you do not value her as much as her younger sister and, I don't think I'm going out on a limb too much here, probably have for the past 33 years.\n\nIt's a tough situation for you, no doubt, but I've seen these situations play out dozens of times.  The disabled child gets all the attention, the other children get somewhat neglected or pushed into a caretaker role and the parents end up alienating them.  Hopefully it doesn't get to that point.  At least your oldest daughter is still inviting you to Christmas so far.", "NAH.  I\u2019m wondering if your youngest knows which exact day is Christmas.  If not, maybe you could have your youngest on Christmas Eve or a day or two before, then travel to your oldest\u2019s for the actual day of Christmas.  I would also see if your husband could help you get the house ready for the youngest.  You shouldn\u2019t be the one who always has to do everything and accommodate everyone.

You mean for ONE Xmas you can\u2019t spend it with your child to celebrate her accomplishment of buying a new house?

Especially severe mental ones. But almost always, parents over compensate on the child with disabilities, and neglect the other children, and it's pretty clear that's what's happening here. \n\nObviously your health is struggling. And that makes things difficult. But you're violating doctor's recommendations for one of your kids, and won't even consider a less tasking way for the other. (Let's be honest, sitting in a car for an hour, uncomfortable but brief and manageable. Compared to whatever care you're giving your second daughter that I'm sure is far more strenuous). I'm not saying you should put your health at risk. But I am pointing out that it's ridiculous you'll do it for one daughter and wouldn't for the other. \n\nAnd the other thing is, yes, autism is hard. but it's not impossible to change. life has changes, it just takes more work to make it happen. What happens if next year you're wheelchair bound and physically can't even attempt to take care of your second daughter? She's capable of more than you're giving her credit for, with support from her team.", "YTA. I\u2019m certain your oldest daughter has felt like an afterthought her entire life.

Like, sure valid reason, but if you are ignoring your doctor's suggestions and have been for years I'm sure you can understand why your other daughter would feel how unfair and unwilling you're being to go the extra mile for her. \n\nIt's likely she's used to playing second fiddle and thought just once you'd be excited for something big and important to her.", "YTA. Your older daughter has needs, too, and it's very wrong of you to neglect those needs for the other child. Your older daughter was probably forced to grow up and be independent faster than her peers. She probably had to sacrifice a lot in her childhood.

It's a shit situation all the way around. It's a royal pain in the ass when there's never allowed to be any flexibility in plans, but that's what kids on the spectrum need much of the time.

Based on your post, I seriously doubt it.  As another commenter noted, you very well could have done Christmas with your disabled daughter earlier or later, but NT daughter's desire for your presence just didn't matter.  When you finally totally destroy your back caretaking against specialist recommendations, don't be surprised at being told to just deal with it on your own.", "YTA\n\nLook I get the need for consistency, and so Christmas Day is perfectly understandable. But you keep prioritizing everything else over your other daughter and I have a feeling after this, you\u2019re not going to like where you are placed on her list of priorities.\n\nYou\u2019ve told your daughter, repeatedly over the years, that your list of priorities are her sister, your back, then her.\n\nSo in the future when you are no longer her priority, when you aren\u2019t invited to her big moments or your grandkids big moments, when you pass and she refuses to have anything to do with her sister due to resentment, when you want her to visit or need her help and she chooses to step away because you\u2019ve told her she\u2019s last on your priority list - you only have your own actions to blame.\n\nThere are ways to show your daughter she\u2019s important while still providing your other daughter the safety and consistency she needs but you are repeatedly choosing to only do one or the other.

Youngest also doesn't understand that everything revolves around her, that you're deliberately exacerbating your health issues to care for her, or that her sister is, as usual, getting whatever measly leftover scraps of affection she can.

Also, you are not doing any good for your youngest by threatening your own health and physical ability to care for her when you are clearly no longer physically able to do so. You are so concerned about disappointing her, but there will come a time when you are simply  unable to \"tough it out\" and what will happen then? I think you are better off starting with small changes to her \"routine\" now because you will not be able to keep Christmas \"as it's always been,\" your other daughter is being treated differently because of this, and you are in danger of possibly hurting yourself to the point of not being able to help ANYONE anymore. Something has to give here.\n\nI understand the challenges you are facing, but at some point you have to put yourself and your other family members at the same level of concern as your youngest daughter. Her having extra needs does not mean you can neglect all other relationships or treat your oldest differently because she should just \"understand.\" You go out of your way, put yourself into physical pain, make specific arrangements - all just to keep your youngest happy. You do not do anything similar for your oldest. It's not really healthy to continue this way. You will also not always be around and will not be able to do this forever for your youngest. NOW is the time to start dealing with the adjustment, as hard as it will be.\n\nI would suggest making it work next time. Either you try to bring your daughter to her sisters (with help of aides or other family members) or you see one daughter on xmas eve and one on christmas day.

The drive alone with your back problem is too much, and she should understand. But if she's like my family, they see all the other missed or ruined events over the years and it's hard for them to not let them cause resentment as a whole. I didn't have my son at Christmas this year for the first time. He's 22. There was just no physical way for me to manage him and my toddler and he is in too much pain to enjoy it. He also hates new places and having to sit still and upright. I had to let my own guilt be filed-away, and try it differently this year. But it is not so easy as you know well I'm sure. She is your child. You love her and know her in a way no one else can possibly understand. It is impossible to do a good job as a special needs parent, and *not* disappoint other kids and family.

I went to school with a non-verbal kid, he would parrot when it was a \"yes\", and would be silent when it was a \"no\", he also knew the calendar like it was a normal thing, and by normal you could ask this guy what day the 5th of November would be in 30 year time and he would be right every single time. He knew the date at all times and he knew every single holiday on that thing and he knew the history of each holiday, and honestly it was probably his special interest. The only other time we ever heard him talk was he would repeat the holiday name on the day of the holiday if we just happened to be at school for it or if we ran into him somewhere in the neighborhood with his mom and dad. You could not tell this person that Christmas was on another day and he was wrong, he already knew he was right. His parents had to have the house set up JUST right, or he would have a meltdown. stocking HAD to be hung on a fireplace, the tree HAD to be off in the dining room for what reason, I don't know, it was something that he had to have. the decorations HAD to be the ones that they always had, he hated garland so that never went up. it HAD to be gold and red wrapping, never anything else. It was crazy. I only remember this because I remember thinking, I like when my parents change the decoration and stuff, why doesn't he? At the time I was....I think 7, I understood he was different, but I didn't truly understand why he was different. It wasn't just Christmas either that he did this with, it was all the holidays. They HAD to go to church on Palm and Easter Sunday...and they weren't even Catholic or Christian, they were Bhuddist lol. Easter eggs had to be in tones of yellow, red, and varying shades of these. It was wild to hear and witness really when we went to school. \n\nWhile the parents say she's non-verbal and the daughter wouldn't be the wiser about celebrating the holiday on a different day than the older one, the daughter could be like the guy I knew a long time ago in that she's taken a special interest in the calendar and they truly can't talk her out of it.", "Glass child here, I'm still dealing with the damage from that at the age of 43.", "Very well said and points that I hope OP considers with an open mind.

Gradual preparation and baby steps work better. \n\nIt actually IS true that the older daughter can understand at a level the younger one can't. Yes it's disappointing and I hope the parents visit sooner rather than later and find ways to show they care, but all the comments accusing them of playing favoritism and sacrificing the relationship with the older daughter really seem to be coming from a total lack of experience or understanding of living with an autistic family member.

My point was simply that if everybody is talking about Christmas and everybody is decorating for Christmas, a toddler who is hypersensitive to change of any kind, and especially environmental change (i.e., OP's disabled daughter) will *absolutely* recognize that Christmas is happening. \n\nA toddler doesn't really have a concept of date or time, true, nor do they have significant long-term memory.

It you start putting up streamers and balloons and talking about gifts and cake, a 3-year-old will not only recognize that a birthday party may be happening, but they *will* get excited about it. If everybody starts hanging Christmas decorations and decorating trees and playing holiday music and talking about holiday plans, a 3- or even 2-year-old is fully capable of extrapolating that a Holiday is happening and getting excited about it. 2-4 is precisely when that recognition of and excitement about those kinds of events begins to happen. \n\nSo it's absurd to simply claim that OP's disabled daughter \"has no idea what Christmas is\" without any evidence supporting that.

If she is as opposed to having you in her group home as she would be having an aide or extra support at yours, seeing her for Christmas may become much more difficult in the coming years. \n\nFor many years, my siblings and I did \u201cThanksgiving Part 2\u201d in order to celebrate with each other. We are a blended family and wanted to be together but knew it would be hard with five of us as we started having our own families. This allowed us to do Thanksgiving twice and see everyone. It may be something to think about in the coming years. \n\nI hope you all had a beautiful Christmas.", "NTA BUT - Mom of a disabled child here - I heard a quote once, that if we do too much for our special needs children now, they won't  be able to survive without us.  At a certain age, we have to start letting go so that they can survive. \n\nYou won't be here forever and it doesn't sound like your older daughter can or should take this Christmas holiday tradition on. The best time to start new holiday traditions for your youngest daughter is now while you're here to help support her through a transition to a new tradition, whatever that may be.\n\nYou're not failing her by letting go a little bit. You're a Mom, but you've also been a caretaker for over thirty years. You deserve some peace and rest too.", "NTA.  Your eldest daughter is being positively unreasaonble.  She has known her sister all her life. She knows all of this, and yet, she persists.   I know it can be hard for siblings of those with special needs, but she is an adult sibling, not a child.  After you and your husband, there is no one who should understand your younger daughter's situation better than the elder.\n\nAs the parent of an adult male very, very much like your daughter (except he still lives with us), I know for a fact he would expect Christmas to be as it always has been were he to live elsewhere and then return for the holdiays.  My son can also become very destructive when distraught.  I don't know if that is the case with your daughter, but it is something we always take into consideration before taking him into anyone's home.   I have a feeling that if you did bring your younger daughter into this new situation and things invariably went sideways, your older daugher would still say her sister had ruined the hoilday.  In this case, why put the younger of the two through that?  Just keep her at home where she is content.  Why upset everyone?\n\n100% NTA\n\nEDIT: After reading some of the comments I'm still sticking with NTA.  Why?  Because this shit is hard.  And I'll tell you why OP mentions her back--because we parents of special needs kids get older.  We get injured.  Sometimes by our own kids.  Also, she has made provisions for her daughter--she lives in a group home and is settled enough that she doesn't want her parents there.  I feel like this is genuinely a topic anyone who hasn't walked in these shoes can never truly understand.  Until you have tried to reason with a 250, 6'1\" toddler that still wets the bed sometimes, or becomes uncorked because of the OCD aspect of autism, you will never fully grasp what myself or the OP are up against.  But you know who does?\n\nHer older daughter.  She's seen it all.  \n\nThankfully, my son is an only child.  He needs--and can get--all of our attention.  But I do know other parents of special needs (now) adults with older siblings who have had to make compromises.  It is an incredible balancing act and requires a tremendous amount of grace from the neurotypical siblings. \n\nAnd, in one final answer to something that keeps coming up, I absolutely think the younger daughter would know when Christmas Eve is.  It's insulting to imply she is that unaware.  My son loves calendars and checks his and ours every single day, often mulitple times a day.", "What a kind message and delivery.", "This is an amazing and thoughtful answer.", "Absolutely this.", "This is the most kind, compassionate and insightful response I have ever read here.", "> Yes, your special-needs child was dealt a horrible hand, but so were your other children.

I\u2019m sorry. Your actions are alienating your older daughter. You are also setting up your younger daughter for a traumatic transition when you and your husband are no longer around. \n\nTalk to your older daughter and let her know that over this upcoming year, you will ask the care home workers to start working with your youngest to talk about the concept of change and, yes, death.  Let your oldest know that next year, you will NOT host your youngest child, but you will go to her care home either on Christmas Eve OR Christmas Day. Explain that this current  year is the last time you will host her sister. And then follow through.  \n\nDoing this will allow a transition for your youngest daughter. Each time you talk to your youngest either in person or on the phone, mention how exciting it will be for her to have Christmas with her friends, and that she will have new fun things to do with them. You could even speak with her care team and ask how many residents stay there at Christmas.  Then see if you could send appropriate games or snacks. \n\n If there is a tradition you do with her when she comes home for Xmas, ask the care team if you could send items to incorporate them with the other residents.\n\nBy going to see her on one of the days, there will be a bit of the old routine in that she sees you.  You do not want the first time her Xmas plans are changed to coincide with loss of you or your spouse.\n\nPlease realize that you oldest has not been a priority since the birth of your youngest.  You need to apologize for that and then ask her what she would like to see changed. When you do apologize, BE SPECIFIC.\n\nSpecific means you need to reflect and realize what she missed out on- Christmas has never been about her since your youngest came along. Was she expected to be a third parent prior to the youngest being placed in care? Did you not attend your oldest\u2019s school events because your youngest would act out or did you take the youngest-who then acted out? During this discussion, allow your oldest to bring up things where she felt slighted.\n\nAlso, if your oldest is not receptive, be understanding, but follow through with the plan and make yourself available to your oldest. After years of being ignored in place of your youngest, she might trust that you will follow through.\n\nBest of luck.", "Came here to say this.  OP, please set her up for success before you either can't do it anymore or you're gone.  At some point, she's not going to be having Christmas at your place anymore.  Better to start getting her used to that while you're still here.\n\nIs your eldest planning on children eventually?  Very often, once your kids are old enough to believe, you start nesting on Christmas day and don't want to haul the kids away from most of their new gifts.  Her not being willing to travel might become inevitable.  Also prepare for her to shield her children if necessary if your youngest doesn't handle them well, which will mean you having to choose whom you're going to spend each holiday with if that becomes necessary.\n\nYou had a good run with the status quo.

I think there's an easy way to deal with that, just telling her she gets to celebrate Christmas at \"home\" but also at her group home...  there's a good chance she'd be able to \"roll\" with that...\n\nbut yeah.  It is something they would have to explain to her so she didn't freak out later at the group home.\n\n(And I say this as someone who has small children, and we've done all sorts of various timings for things around the holidays, and if the sister is really of similar cognitive level as a toddler...  it might be doable.\n\nI would say NAH though...  because I don't blame the older sister for wanting to celebrate her first holiday in her new home, and OP most likely could have figured out a way to make it work.", "As someone who spent most of their adult life in disability services, this is a tale as old as time.

Their lives revolve around medication schedules, doctor and therapy visits, and the routines that they hope will get them through one more day without a meltdown.

You also only know your kid as *you* know your kid. It's really hard to imagine them in other circumstances, especially when you don't really know what residential care can look like.
