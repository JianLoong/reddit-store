My best friend (F), stepsister, and have all lived together for a year. Things are great, we all do our part, the only issue is step sisters boyfriend, Sam. \n\nMy best friend and I aren\u2019t the biggest fan of him. He\u2019s arrogant, petty, and SO entitled. Her and I are very relaxed people, so we\u2019re cordial with him and get along for the most part. A few (of MANY) examples of his bullshittery: \n\n1. If I leave for more than 5 mins he moves his car into my spot. 2. He will happily move my kitchen, bathroom, etc stuff as he pleases. 3. Helps himself to everything we own, including food. 4. If we have a different opinion on anything he will explain every reason why I\u2019m wrong. \n\nI\u2019ve asked nicely a few times for some of this to change. It hasn\u2019t, so I just ignore it most of the time.\n\nThe issue at hand: I just experienced the most excruciating period of my life. I had to stay home from work because of how bad it was and I only left my room for the necessities. I woke up in the middle of the night with intense cramps, so I took a bath. Accidentally left my underwear which had a stain on it (the girls don\u2019t have an issue with this). However, Sam had the biggest bitch fit over it. First of all, sometimes he comes over late as hell and I genuinely didn\u2019t know he was there. Second, it\u2019s partly my house?\n\nAnyways, when I woke up the next morning he didn\u2019t hesitate to lecture me on how disgusting it was, how can I live like that, I\u2019m inconsiderate, etc. What got me was the \u201cI technically live here\u201d comment. \n\nWhere I might be the AH: I lost it. \u201cTechnically, you DON\u2019T live here. You are a scummy little freeloader who has absolutely no respect for others. If my period panties make you uncomfortable, I\u2019ll make sure to hide a pair in absolutely everything you touch. Fuck you\u201d something of the sort. \n\nMy step sister took his side, which pissed me off because I know she did it to avoid arguing with him. So I followed with \u201cyou come into my room once a week to talk about how he\u2019s a piece of shit, i don\u2019t want to hear it from you\u201d and I went to my room. \n\nThey\u2019ve been at his parents house for 2 days (when this happened), and I haven\u2019t responded to the mass messages telling me if I want to broadcast my period I should live on my own. \n\nI only slightly feel like a dick because I was raised better than to talk to others like that. But on the other hand, I\u2019m a good roommate. I\u2019m clean, I provide the most for the house (not a jab at the girls, just Sam, who contributes NOTHING), and it\u2019s over some god damn period panties. My best friend agrees, but my step sister and Sam won\u2019t let up. My parents think I should just apologize to keep the peace.

In fact your sister should have had him contributing as soon as he spent so much time there and repeatedly touched, ate, and moved things. You again are NTA. He needed someone to finally yell at him and tell him how he\u2019s behaving in another persons home is not okay. He has absolutely NOT EFFING RIGHT to lecture you on how you live and call you inconsiderate because he\u2019s there all the time. The only person I would talk to would be your sister. I would say \u201cstarters I\u2019m not sorry, if care and love him that is your choice but I stand by my point that on the worst period of my life I didn\u2019t need him lecturing me and telling me I should be considerate to him in my our home. However I feel bad for yelling at you. Instead of immediately taking his side on him doggy me for leaving panties in the bathroom after a bath you should have told us to calm down and said you understood the pain I was in. So yeah when you immediately just agreed with him that he lives there and I\u2019m gross i drug you down too.\u201d She lives there but this is a wake up call that things should change.

I could touch on how he's a misogynist and crappy moocher but this post will be full of that so I just want to point out that this situation is bigger than the period panties. \n\nIt's clear you, and likely your friend are feeling very resentful over this guy, and for good reasons. That said, it seems like a bigger conversation needs to be had with your sister and roommate about boundaries within the home, especially boundaries around guests.  This should include rules about being responsible for one's own guests, ensuring they know what can and can't be used or touched. The conversation should also include conversation about frequency of visits and if/when a partner should be expected to contribute financially as well as with household chores etc.\n\nI don't think you should apologize to keep the peace but that doesn't mean you shouldn't maybe sit down for a more peaceful level-headed conversation about the issue.", "Fuck keeping the peace.

Obviously it wasn\u2019t very nice of you to say that stuff and I do think it would be nice to apologize just to cover your own butt but he had it coming and I\u2019m glad you could get that off your chest lol. He sounds like a disrespectful little brat and needs to learn his place.", "ESH. Sam is clearly in the wrong. Your reaction is understandable.

Make sure to tell her if she comes back he can't touch SHIT in the apartment bc he doesn't live there.", "Keep what peace? This man is destroying your entire home life and stealing from you. You put up with this because why? Why are two roommates forced to allow a third roommate to move a fourth roommate in? Kick the step sister out as soon as you can. I'm guessing this dude lives with his parents so \"lives\" with you all to get away from them? The hell with that. NTA but stop being so passive.\n\nAlso! He thinks he lives there! Does he get mail there because you all might have let this dude become a tenant, which is probably against your lease. You need to get a lock on your fridge and start hiding your food. Your asshole stepsister is 100% at fault and needs to be kicked out so Sam is no longer in your house.", "NTA. This kind of response would be warranted just over him moving shit around in your apartment and eating your food and taking your parking spot after being told repeatedly not to imo.", "NTA-this misogynist fuktool can yeet right off.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t live there and him saying he does would have made me angry too. What does he contribute financially? I am guessing nothing. Do not apologize and hopefully he stays away forever - problem solved!!", "As a guy, periods happen, we know about them. Sure they aren\u2019t the most pleasant thing for us to be confronted with but at the end of the day it\u2019s a bit of blood. Boy needs to grow up, if you can\u2019t handle what the females body puts out you\u2019re not mature enough to be putting \u201cthings\u201d in it. NTA.", "NTA. Taking an NSAID like naproxen sodium 48 hours before your period starts can stop your body producing the prostaglandins that can cause painful periods. I have endometriosis and this really helps me.\nYou need to take it before the period though, once you start bleeding is too late as your body has already created the prostaglandin.", "NTA let her move in with Sam. He needs to stay out of your house.", "Absolutely MoocherGuy! Technically he lives there. Well, just can\u2019t wait for your portion of rent then, Bucko.", "^This \ud83c\udf96\ufe0f", "Oh and try some ginger tea! It's a bit slow and you'll need like 3 cups but it helps with cramps. I saw a few suggestions for TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) and herbs but you might want to just visit a TCM doctor to have a general look at your health. They'll know what herbs to take and what counters what. Everyone is different too.", "Maybe it's time for stepsister to think about living somewhere else....oh and NTA.", "A great book that helped me when I came off BC was Period Power - so many helpful things in there to make your cycle so much better! NTA a million times over!", "Retroactive back rent. Although, that would serve to make him feel more \"entitled\" to dictate how the household functions. Never give him the power! \n\nNTA", "You and the other roommate may want to look into no renewing the lease with you step sister if you can get away with it.", "ought you were advising some weird bullshit cure for her period issues, but by the end of the comment I saw you for the diabolical genius you are!", "pig blood >:D", "Magnesium is good for leg cramps too, I use it for that.", "Yeah, it would. They just need to put their feet down and tell stepsister he\u2019s not welcome to come outside of regular guest timings/durations.", "Your papa is amazing and totally my hero!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I just snorted Baileys out of my nose onto the cat. He\u2019s not impressed"]}
