To give a brief history, Ex racked up $5k on my personal credit card, I broke up with him, he left me with the full debt. We used to split costs 50/50 but since the breakup he Hasn\u2019t paid a dime towards our toddler since or made any effort to see her unless is was suuuuuuper convenient for him. He has seen her maybe 5 or 6 times for an hour over the last two months. Important to know he lives 15mins walking distance or (two minutes driving) away.\n\nYesterday he texts me in the evening saying he wants to see her and take her to daycare in the morning. I told him sure, we wake up at 7:30, have breakfast and leave for daycare at 9. I told him the mornings are not time for play, but if he wants to still be there that\u2019s fine.\n\nAt 8:47am he\u2019s still not at my place to see our toddler, so I text him to see where if he\u2019s still coming. He says\u201d no, I\u2019m working but I can come later if that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time he has canceled plans last minute to see his our little one. I told him no, he can\u2019t see her later because I have plans. Then I told him I need some space and to not speak to me for a while, and that means don\u2019t try to make plans to see our little one. I\u2019m tired of making plans to fit his schedule only to have him not even show. Thank goodness our child is too little to understand what\u2019s going on, and I don\u2019t want her to have the experience of constant abandonment by her father so little in life.\n\nHe says I can\u2019t stop him from seeing his child, and I blocked him. I never stopped him from seeing his child before this, he has always canceled or just not shown up.
