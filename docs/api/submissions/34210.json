Think your husband needs to enforce his boundaries better though. By letting it happen it's almost like he's enabling her behaviour.", "NTA.  I can totally see how you both could\u2019ve just written it off as a joke. Crucially, however, she\u2019s a grown woman. If she likes to dish it, she needs to know how to take it.", "NTA - I mean you just gave her what she enjoys so much, right?

I would definitely laugh if I saw that happen. She had it coming and she couldn't handle that everyone laughed at her. Let's see if she continues to harass your husband... She sounds pleasant /s", "NTA, she'll leave your husband alone now and she'll keep her tasteless jokes to herself", "NTA; maybe she\u2019ll stop making people uncomfortable now.", "ESH. Her for her inappropriate comment, you for throwing food like you are a 2 yr old who can't use her words, and your husband for not shutting your sil  down the first time she flirted with him.", "NTA.

Ew!", " NTA - but why tf have you, your husband and his brother not spoken about your SIL\u2019s behavior? If it happens again you should directly call her out and your husband should as well. No throwing things (despite how funny), no flipping out, just sincerely \u201cYou constantly sexually harassing my husband makes him and I incredibly uncomfortable, so you stop or we\u2019re not going to be around you anymore as you can\u2019t seem to control your inappropriate behavior.\u201d", "NTA, but sorry, reading that story has me craving a hot dog rn", "NTA.

It's AITA. \n\nGrown adults don't throw food to shut down sexual harassment. SIL is inappropriate, your husband should have shut it down ages ago, and the entire family is complicit.", "NTA and very funny.

Soft YTA because throwing things at someone is violence even if it's justified. I mean if she loves sausage so much.... haha", "ESH. Violence is never the answer.

Why does her uncouth behavior justify your uncouth behavior in your mind?", "ESH, but you suck more.\n\nYour SIL is clearly out-of-line, but **you threw** (and wasted) **a fucking hot dog at a person**... Of course you're an AH.", "YTA, her being annoying doesn't give you the right to throw food at her. Both of you need to grow up.", "YTA. You absolutely should not have been uncivil about her feelings towards your husband, and you most definitely shouldn\u2019t have picked a good fight with her. Optitron.
