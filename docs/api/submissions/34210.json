A hot dog is pretty funny though. Why is your husband\u2019s brother cool with this?", "If she's stopped talking to you and your husband, then all is well. Your strategy worked.", "Nta. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nI love you. That's absolutely awesome. Play stupid games... \ud83c\udf2d", "NTA this is hilarious, she deserved it", "Great comeback! NTA NTA NTA!", "Nta. It did make me smile. Think your husband needs to enforce his boundaries better though. By letting it happen it's almost like he's enabling her behaviour.", "NTA.  I can totally see how you both could\u2019ve just written it off as a joke. Crucially, however, she\u2019s a grown woman. If she likes to dish it, she needs to know how to take it.", "NTA - I mean you just gave her what she enjoys so much, right? HAHAHA", "I guess no sausages were available on the table\nEdit: NTA, it\u2019s funny", "Let she who is without meat, cast the first hotdog.. NTA", "Bravo! Bravo!!\nWell played, SIL left the door open for you...\nOh if only I was there, would jump up and do the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Hot Dog Dance\n\"Hot Dog Hot Dog, your problem solved...\"\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would definitely laugh if I saw that happen. She had it coming and she couldn't handle that everyone laughed at her. Let's see if she continues to harass your husband... She sounds pleasant /s", "NTA, she'll leave your husband alone now and she'll keep her tasteless jokes to herself", "NTA; maybe she\u2019ll stop making people uncomfortable now.", "ESH. Her for her inappropriate comment, you for throwing food like you are a 2 yr old who can't use her words, and your husband for not shutting your sil  down the first time she flirted with him.", "NTA. Question - where the heck is her husband during by all this??  Does he seriously not have issues with his wife making sexual comments to or about his brother?  Ew!", " NTA - but why tf have you, your husband and his brother not spoken about your SIL\u2019s behavior? If it happens again you should directly call her out and your husband should as well. No throwing things (despite how funny), no flipping out, just sincerely \u201cYou constantly sexually harassing my husband makes him and I incredibly uncomfortable, so you stop or we\u2019re not going to be around you anymore as you can\u2019t seem to control your inappropriate behavior.\u201d", "NTA, but sorry, reading that story has me craving a hot dog rn", "NTA. What an entirely appropriate response! Well done!", "Since the in-laws that were hosting clearly had no issue with your toss since they laughed, I would say NTA all the way. FAFO!! \ud83c\udf2d", "lmfao NTA", "Follow-up......did you get her in the mouth with the sausage?\n\nSure throwing food is a little immature BUT I'd probably do the same. Hero level!", "NTA. Joking about how much you like sausage in your mouth is fine for sorority parties but not family dinners. Maybe she can learn to act like an adult in between dodging wieners.", "NTA. She's sexually harassing that poor man, and *she's married to his brother too*. How is anyone else okay with this behavior repeating?????", "Totally NTA here. Fuxk her. Lol", "NTA, you did well", "NTA tell her you were \"just joking\" and see how her arguments fall", "ESH. Adults don\u2019t throw food. At least ones who are house trained. \n\nThat said, SIL is a jerk. \n\nApologize for throwing food but also explain to her what has been bothering you. The good news is a conversation has to be had and it\u2019s forced an opportunity for you to talk about the bigger issues.", "NTA she sounds gross.", "NTA. Nobody has ever deserved to be pelted with wieners more than your SIL.", "ESH. While your reaction is completely understandable, it's generally not wise to sink to the level of people who annoy you. You probably know that anyway; it does get easier over time to resist the impulse to react.", "NTA - she seems to be a prick and the family wasn\u2019t offended to have it happen in their house.", "NTA. Sounds like you fixed your problem if she's not talking to you.", "NTA. LMAO that\u2019s hilarious. Also your SIL is so gross. That\u2019s sexual harassment.", "Who the fuck buys this shit", "NTA. This is hilarious. Sometimes a bit of immaturity gets the point across better than anything.", "Too hilarious to be the asshole. And now she won't talk to you!?! Well played.", "NTA that\u2019s what she gets for sexually harassing your husband. She wanted a sausage so she got one.", "NTA. Tell her it was just a joke.\n\nFrankly, I'd go a step further... Get an Oscar Meyer Hot Dog \"piggy bank\" and whenever she is inappropriate with your husband, add money to it. At the end of the year, gift her a crap ton of hotdogs with the money.\n\nAnd I specify the piggy bank because you just have to bring it to the family functions lol. I'm petty AF though.\n\nEdit for typos, context.", "here, you dropped this \ud83d\udc51", "Lmaoooo I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s hilarious NTA", "Please tell me your in laws have a video of it somehow. Please post it for us to watch even if you have to blur faces.\n\nNTA for throwing it.", "YTA. You are a grown adult. When someone makes an inappropriate joke you can either ignore it, like most sane adults would do, or politely explain that you are not comfortable with her making sexual jokes toward your husband. Use your words. Communicate. If you are older than about 5, throwing food at the dinner table is not an acceptable way to express your feelings.", "ESH\n\nSIL is an AH for obvious reasons, but everyone at that table who has let her get away with saying her flirting and innuendoes are just jokes for this long is an AH too.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d would have been a good thing to say.", "NTA. You're like a rock star. lol", "YTA. Not only for throwing food like a child, but also wasting it. \n\nYour husband needs to tell your SIL to back off.", "I\u2019ll take things that didn\u2019t happen for $500, Alex.", "ESH. \n\nThis isn't \"were my actions hysterical\", y'all. It's AITA. \n\nGrown adults don't throw food to shut down sexual harassment. SIL is inappropriate, your husband should have shut it down ages ago, and the entire family is complicit.", "NTA and very funny. I am completely upset at people who use \"joking\" as an excuse for abuse or harassment. It is only a joke if everyone thinks it is funny. If someone is uncomfortable or hurt by a joke or prank, then it is not a joke/prank ...it is abuse.", "NTA\n\nIf, for whatever reason this comes up again, tell her if she likes it so much, she should catch it in her mouth next time as to not waste it!!!\n\nSome people need the emotional slap to get the point.", "NTA", "NTA.\nYou were just passing the sausage that she so craved.", "I would have laughed too. Soft YTA because throwing things at someone is violence even if it's justified. I mean if she loves sausage so much.... haha", "ESH. Violence is never the answer. Throwing things at people with the internet to hurt them is not okay.", "ESH. SIL is clearly AH for her behavior. You're AH for throwing a hot dog at her. You're old enough to know better!", "Yta", "YTA.  Why does her uncouth behavior justify your uncouth behavior in your mind?", "ESH, but you suck more.\n\nYour SIL is clearly out-of-line, but **you threw** (and wasted) **a fucking hot dog at a person**... Of course you're an AH.", "YTA, her being annoying doesn't give you the right to throw food at her. Both of you need to grow up.", "YTA. You absolutely should not have been uncivil about her feelings towards your husband, and you most definitely shouldn\u2019t have picked a good fight with her. Optitron. What the hell were you thinking? What are you, four years old? Get over yourself. Maybe get a job, a boyfriend and move on with your life. Leave the girl alone.
