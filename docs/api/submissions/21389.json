The ones that go up in the air and make boom noises and sparks and what not. Let me preface to say:\n\n1. I live in a state where fireworks are LEGAL on July 4th\n2. I checked on my city website and could not find anything stating that fireworks are not allowed\n3. I do not live in an HOA\n\nSo we started at about 9 pm at the front of my house. We did 12 rockets which took about 15 minutes then a final 20 shot firework display which took about a minute. The whole thing was a out 15 - 20 minutes long. \n\nRight when we finished 2 neighbor ( one of them I met once before) ladies ran up to us and said that if we continue that they were gonna call the cops ( we had literally just finished). I started speaking to them and they said that one of our neighbors called them (someone who lives across the street from me who I know and am friendly with) and said that it's so loud and their dog is frightened. They said that the sparks were hitting their house and that they have dogs also and they are hiding under the couch. \n\nNow we had moved here a little more then a year ago and we don't like to make trouble. We never play loud music or make any crazy parties. We are a quiet family with 2 kids. She started saying that the city I live in that these \"professional\" fireworks are illegal which is cap. I told her it's a once a year thing that we wanted to show the kids so they have some good memories. We don't even do fireworks on new years. Literally as she said that some other neighbors down the road set off some fireworks but not the ones that fly up in the air, just the ground ones. I explained to her that I got the fireworks in our city and a cop was literally there the whole time while I was buying it. Meanwhile probably a few hundred feet away people are doing the flying in the air fireworks as well. She said in 25 years she never heard it so loud. I did apologize for making the loud noises and scaring her dogs and she also apologized a few times she said to enjoy our 4th and went on her way. \n\nAITA for doing fireworks? I totally get being considerate with your neigbors and we are but is 15-20 minutes a year on a holiday that is known for this stuff being a bad neighbor?\n\nTLDR: Did loud LEGAL fireworks in front of my house and was told off by a couple neighbors.

Like, lots of traditions are stupid, but unless they are wildly outdated and frowned upon, I don't think you should be considered for doing them, especially in moderation.\n\nAlso my perception is skewed as I live in Texas and EVERYONE jams hours of fireworks well into unacceptably wee hours of the morning.", "NTA - it's the 4th of July.  Was it considerate of your neighbors? Nope.  But your neighbors should all expect it on the 4th if it's truly legal in your area.  My dog is anxiety-prone and she has a verrrry tough time with fireworks noise, but that's why I arranged for a medication for the 4th that would calm her.  \n\nNow that you know that your neighbors are going to give you a super hard time about lighting off fireworks (and if sparks were truly falling near homes, no bueno) I suggest finding a spot far afield to light them next year.", "YTA.

So are you now knowingly going to set fireworks off whilst knowing that it can set off reactions in people and their pets for far longer than your 15 minutes of fun.

Setting off fireworks in a residential neighborhood will always be an asshole move.

As someone who doesn't live in the US, yeah, setting off explosions in your front yard sounds like an asshole thing to do to your neighbours. We have fireworks in my country for other things like new years, festivals, holidays etc and it's all designated in a public area like a park or arena so if people want to take their kids to see they can. I don't know why people need to set off such bigs ones on their street with no consideration for their neighbours. Yeah it's only 15 minutes but it's still 15 minutes you're torturing dogs, people with autism, veterans with ptsd.

Hopefully you learn from this.", "YTA because I despise people who want fireworks just outside their door. In my country is illegal and permit needed to use fireworks but the law is not applied so anyone does it. \n\nThat being said, they use them at any given point. Weddings, christenings, birthdays, gender reviled parties etc. It's getting ridiculous. \n\nThe amount of stress that fireworks cause to many people and not to mention animals is fenomenal.

For lots of reasons:\n\n1. Fireworks are incredibly dangerous for your neighbours and people in general. They start fires, can cause injuries.\n\n2. You might own your yard, but I guarantee those fireworks weren't exploding and only affecting your yard/house. E.G. Last night people were setting off giant fireworks on the street behind us. They exploded above our house. \n\n3. Fireworks also have major detrimental effects in local wildlife. They can ruin the abilities of various animals, kill them, and injure them badly. \n\n4. Additionally fireworks are detrimental to: babies, pets, many veterans, neurodiverse people, people with PTSD, and others. \n\nThere's plenty of other reasons too. \n\nJust because something is legal doesn't mean it's good. Let's not forget what fireworks actually are: explosives. \n\nFor all those saying people should \"know\" and \"prepare\"... we do. It doesn't fix the problem. No matter how much I prepare, I cannot explain to my dogs, cats, and even my own anxiety response that everything is fine. That's not how these things work. You cannot turn off your natural response to danger because \"but it makes pretty lights\". \n\nI used to love the fireworks as a child. We went every year to see the city's show.

You weren\u2019t intending to harm anyone, and maybe just didn\u2019t consider how the fireworks would affect others in your neighborhood. Maybe not the most considerate move, but not an asshole move.\n\nIf you knew about the dogs and went ahead anyway, that would be different. Maybe discuss with your neighbors whether or not they would be okay with something so close to their homes next time.

The ones that go up in the air and make boom noises and sparks and what not. Let me preface to say:\n\n1. I live in a state where fireworks are LEGAL on July 4th\n2. I checked on my city website and could not find anything stating that fireworks are not allowed\n3. I do not live in an HOA\n\nSo we started at about 9 pm at the front of my house. We did 12 rockets which took about 15 minutes then a final 20 shot firework display which took about a minute. The whole thing was a out 15 - 20 minutes long. \n\nRight when we finished 2 neighbor ( one of them I met once before) ladies ran up to us and said that if we continue that they were gonna call the cops ( we had literally just finished). I started speaking to them and they said that one of our neighbors called them (someone who lives across the street from me who I know and am friendly with) and said that it's so loud and their dog is frightened. They said that the sparks were hitting their house and that they have dogs also and they are hiding under the couch. \n\nNow we had moved here a little more then a year ago and we don't like to make trouble. We never play loud music or make any crazy parties. We are a quiet family with 2 kids. She started saying that the city I live in that these \"professional\" fireworks are illegal which is cap. I told her it's a once a year thing that we wanted to show the kids so they have some good memories. We don't even do fireworks on new years. Literally as she said that some other neighbors down the road set off some fireworks but not the ones that fly up in the air, just the ground ones. I explained to her that I got the fireworks in our city and a cop was literally there the whole time while I was buying it. Meanwhile probably a few hundred feet away people are doing the flying in the air fireworks as well. She said in 25 years she never heard it so loud (ngl I was kinda proud of that). I did apologize for making the loud noises and scaring her dogs and she also apologized a few times she said to enjoy our 4th and went on her way. \n\nAITA for doing fireworks? I totally get being considerate with your neigbors and we are but is 15-20 minutes a year on a holiday that is known for this stuff being a bad neighbor?\n\nTLDR: Did loud LEGAL fireworks in front of my house and was told off by a couple neighbors.

Just because it's been a long tradition, doesn't mean we can't change it. We know as a society, that they can cause damage to lots of people, critters, and property. Why can't we just give them up?

It's one night a year.  I have never bought a firework, it is illegal in MY state, and I also had a dog with stress-related epilepsy (RIP, Scottie) but it is FUN for some people.   These other people have to stop pissing in OP's cereal.   If it's legal, and you're deliberate and safe, NTA.

Instead of having those effected find a way to accommodate the few. \n\nOne is clearly much simpler to do. And it\u2019s to mitigate the effects of fireworks.
