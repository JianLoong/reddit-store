That\u2019s sad that not all the money is going to your son. Hopefully when he is 18 you can just continue to fund for your son without the influence or interference from his mom", "NTA. The only child that you're responsible for in this situation is your own. You don't owe his stepsiblings a thing. If your ex wants them to have stuff so badly, then she and their father can get off their butts and get it themselves.

She has more than enough to meet the child's needs...she wants that money for something else.", "NTA. Seems like now that the new guy is in the picture, things have changed. It appears that he may be influencing your ex. If it was me, I would drop right back to monthly payments. They sound like jerks.", "NTA at all. You are doing everything right. If she is that concerned, she always has the option to take you back to court. The judge will probably laugh at her.\n\nI\u2019m a firm believer in 2 sides to every story.

She\u2019s getting greedy. I\u2019d love if my ex just paid ANY child support lol.", "NTA. Something is going on. They need this money for something other than supporting your son. Maybe buy Stepson.  a car to make it \"fair\" if they blow this money on a big purchase. Your son won't have his monthly needs met because that money will not be in monthly budget.", "I wouldn't pay in advance, or give post dated checks. Set up the monthly auto payments.

That money is for your son.", "NTA.  She is definitely up to something.  Like buying a car for the stepkid. \n\n Your son is old enough to choose to live with you.

Keep paying her as you wish but I would definitely not give her that money for 16 months upfront because if your son comes to live with you, she won\u2019t be paying it back because she won\u2019t have any left.", "NTA It's time to contact a lawyer and go back to court to get an accounting of where that money is going. Do not give her another penny this year and, to be honest, I'd set up monthly auto payments through your bank. No more lump sums and keep a detailed account of what it's spent on.

Anyone can drive the car and they are still covered.\n\nSomeone could specifically be excluded from a policy, but not adding someone isn't an extra  barrier to them driving the car.\n\nAlso, paying a lump some has no advantage, and it is potentially very disadvantageous. \n\nIf you insist on doing this, you better have an agreement, signed by both parties, recognizing this sum as child support.\n\nOtherwise, it looks like a one-time gift and then not paying your child support.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mom had an auto insurance policy that didn't cover anyone but herself driving her car.  She did that because her premiums were astronomically lower (she never had a ticket or an accident) and she was on a fixed income, so it made sense for her after my dad died.\n\nSince then, several of my coworkers have policies just like that - it only covers one specific driver on a specific car.

Your car is covered no matter who drives it unless you signed a named driver exclusion explicitly listing a person or persons who are not covered when driving the car.", "That's not how car insurance works.

If someone has full comprehensive coverage, then yes it\u2019ll cover uninsured drivers, but not everyone has comprehensive coverage. \n\nSome insurance policies don\u2019t allow no. Insured driver to drive the car. And even the one that do, it has to be with permission of the owner(OP).", "You don't know how insurance works.", "Stop talking out of your ass. Comprehensive coverage has a meaning in an insurance contract. It covers damage to your vehicle caused by things other than a car accident. This includes theft, vandalism, hail damage, space junk, hitting a deer, and spontaneous combustion. Uninsured motorist coverage is also a specific part of a policy. There is uninsured motorist bodily injury that species the limits per person and per accident that the company will pay when you and your passengers are injured by an insured motorist. There is an uninsured motorist collision deductible waiver. Collision coverage fixes your car when you crash it, subject to a deductible. The UM waiver means that you don't owe the deductible when you're hit by an uninsured motorist. Uninsured motorist property damage coverage can be purchased when you don't have collision coverage. This pays up to a specified amount to fix your car when struck by an uninsured motorist. \n\nIt doesn't matter who is driving your car. Your 11 year old could take the car for a joy ride and the carrier will cover it up to the limits of the policy. It doesn't matter if your car is stolen, loaned, misappropriated, or you're taking turns on a road trip. The insurance covers the car without regard to who is operating the vehicle.\n\nIf your kid just got their license and is extremely expensive to list on the policy or your spouse has 3 accidents and a DUI you can exclude them by name using a named driver exclusion. These are the only people who would not be covered when your car is crashed.", "Yeah\u2026you don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about. Insurance can deny coverage if someone else not covered is driving your car.", "LOL", "An insurance company can and has denied coverage because of an uncovered driver. It depends on the company, location, and a few other shit. So please ever so unkindly\u2026.fuck off", "No, they can't. Anyone can drive your car unless they were excluded by name.", "No, they haven't. You don't know what you are talking about. They aren't allowed to do that. It is how insurance works.\n\nStop doubling down on shit you know nothing about.", "Fuck you. I am licensed in every state and have written thousands and thousands of insurance policies for multiple companies. There's no such thing as an uncovered driver. There are excluded drivers whose names and DOB's are listed on a named driver exclusion form and signed by the insured. Outside of this narrow circumstance it doesn't matter if Tom Arnold, Tom Brady, or Benedict Arnold were driving your car. There is no quantifiable risk that an insurance company can charge for in one off instances where someone drives your car. When the car wash attendant pulls your car around you're covered. When the valet drives your car you're covered. When Uncle Steve needs to move your car because you're blocking him in you're covered. These aren't rateable risks and they aren't excluded from the protection that you pay for.", "If you don\u2019t have uninsured coverage, insurance can deny coverage.

Just stop it.", "See, this is where you're starting to talk sense. A rental car is used for a short period of time under very specific circumstances. They want all drivers listed with the rental car agency. If you purchase their insurance they are only going to cover the person listed on their temporary policy. But guess what, dingbat? If I have full coverage car insurance and drive your rental car and crash it, my insurance company will pay the damages even though I'm not listed on the rental car insurance policy. As a policy owner the coverage follows my car no matter who drives it (unless that driver is named as an excluded driver) and the coverage follows me no matter what car I'm driving. If I drive my brother's car and accidentally injured another party my policy will pay for the medical bills (subject to the limits I pay for) even if my brother's policy lapsed. \n\nStop mansplaining shit that you don't know about. Google it you dingus.", "I just told you that they exist. They apply to uninsured people in another vehicle hitting you."]}
