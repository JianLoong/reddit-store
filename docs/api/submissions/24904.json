Comprehensive coverage has a meaning in an insurance contract. It covers damage to your vehicle caused by things other than a car accident. This includes theft, vandalism, hail damage, space junk, hitting a deer, and spontaneous combustion. Uninsured motorist coverage is also a specific part of a policy. There is uninsured motorist bodily injury that species the limits per person and per accident that the company will pay when you and your passengers are injured by an insured motorist. There is an uninsured motorist collision deductible waiver. Collision coverage fixes your car when you crash it, subject to a deductible. The UM waiver means that you don't owe the deductible when you're hit by an uninsured motorist. Uninsured motorist property damage coverage can be purchased when you don't have collision coverage. This pays up to a specified amount to fix your car when struck by an uninsured motorist. \n\nIt doesn't matter who is driving your car. Your 11 year old could take the car for a joy ride and the carrier will cover it up to the limits of the policy. It doesn't matter if your car is stolen, loaned, misappropriated, or you're taking turns on a road trip. The insurance covers the car without regard to who is operating the vehicle.\n\nIf your kid just got their license and is extremely expensive to list on the policy or your spouse has 3 accidents and a DUI you can exclude them by name using a named driver exclusion. These are the only people who would not be covered when your car is crashed.", "Yeah\u2026you don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about.
