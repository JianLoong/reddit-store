My schedule is six 12 hour night shifts in a row.  My husband works for himself and has 100% autonomy over his schedule.  I worked Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas.  I made sure everything was wrapped and organized so all my husband had to do was place gifts under the tree, fill stockings, and \u201csend back\u201d our snitch from the North Pole.  I did all the shopping and even took our two kids to go pick out gifts for him.  Nothing crazy, but 100% from them with hand written cards.  Also my husband is only responsible for filling my stocking and writing me a letter or card.  I don\u2019t really care about expensive gifts, rather I want to know I was considered and thought about for at least a little bit leading up to Christmas. The shifts leading up to Christmas were a lot and heavy to say the least.  I was so excited to get home Christmas morning and just watch my kids and husband open their gift I put a lot of time and thought into.  So I get home and see my husband outside when I pulled up to our place.  I handed him a cider I picked up in the way home.  He gave me no heads up for what I was about to walk into.  I walk into my living room and my kids were i the middle of the chaos that is Christmas morning.  I instantly began to tear up.  My youngest put aside a few gift to wait for me to watch get opened.  My husband told me he was just so tired and they were so excited he couldn\u2019t make them wait.  I got home at 7:45am. However, he wasn\u2019t too tired to put videos in his Snapchat of them opening gifts.  I tired to explain the hurt to my husband and how he is showing our children how I am not a valuable me ever of our family.  I\u2019m trying to not let this hurt consume me, but I wan devastated and feel like I got robbed of a Christmas with my 6 and 9 year old I will never get back.  He also used left over candy to put in my stocking putting absolutely no thought into it at all.  I did play with them and hangout after wards, but I had to get some sleep before my next shift at 7pm.

NTA", "NTA\n\nTime to have a talk with your husband and either a therapist or divorce lawyer. I don\u2019t blame him for failing to stop excited kids from opening gifts on Christmas, but how is it ok to you that he does nothing while you work 12h shifts? Even if somehow you\u2019re ok with having a no-good husband, the literal least he could do is have a thoughtful gesture and a gift for you besides leftover candy. You need a partner, not an extra kid", "NTA and you're completely valid. You put in a TON of effort despite your extremely busy schedule so it's understandable that you'd want reap the reward", "So your husband just had to wait until about 7 45 8 o'clock for you to get home to open presents. If you told me you had work until noon, maybe I would understand. Usually I'd like to give guys the benefit of the doubt, but in this case, sorry, your husband is truly an asshole and  wasn't considerate of your feelings in this situation.", "Nta\n\nThe kids could have waited and husband didn't care enough..", "I don't even have kids and I feel terrible for you.

NTA.", "NTA.  As an RN who has worked graveyard shift dozens of times on Christmas Eve, I can assure you that waiting  till you got home (and putting some damned thought into a gift for you) is an absolutely minimal amount of effort for your partner to have put in.  You have every right to be hurt.", "NTA I get it can be difficult restraining kids but you can still restrain them. Yeah sure if you were getting back hours later maybe I could see his point of view but 7.458am is not at all unreasonable. He really slipped up on this one and you're well within in your rights to feel hurt here.", "NTA. The bar is way too fucking low in your marriage.", "I am usually not in this camp on these things but NTA.  7:45 is do-able and little kid Christmas mornings are a Big thing.

Next year FIRMLY tell them all they'd better wait for you! In fact, I think you might threaten there won't be a next Christmas if they do that again! \n\nI'm a nurse, done shift work same as you, we've waited as late as supper on Christmas day so everyone would be there! Or the whole Christmas celebration can wait until your day off. \n\nTell them all this was rude and hurtful and better not happen again. Give the 7 year old a little grace, but ....You were treated badly and I'm sorry. As far as im concerned your husband is close to divorce land!", "NTA at all.  I worked night shift for 10\nYears before having a family.  I stay home now, as childcare is more expensive than my salary.  (Yay!). \n\nI absolutely would have been devastated. IDK about you, but our family Santa presents are just left out, unwrapped and this gives the kids stuff to play with while everyone wakes up/showers/parents get breakfast ready etc.    \n\nWe all had to clean up/eat and then presents can happen.   I know a lot of people just tear into it, but forums this works. Some years my husband has to work and we wait for him.  We do toys from Santa heavy those years and then  open presents around 2 when he gets back home.   The children all respect this bc daddy works hard and wants to see them and be part of it.   \n\nI absolutely feel your hurt though.  Our first few years we had a hard time finding OUR mesh of his childhood and mine to tailor and fit our family.  I finally had to have my best friend TELL HIM that he needs to put at least SOMETHING in my stocking- because each parent should get at least one stocking surprise!! \n\nWe all love the excitement and wonder if the holiday, and parents especially miss it.   \n\nI say after your long stretch is over and you\u2019re rested, snuggle up with your honey and tell him how you feel calmly.  Validate that he wanted the kids to have a blast and you appreciate that, however you\u2019d like to come up with a plan for the next time you work. \n\nKeep trucking Momma. Those kids will one day see your hard work and appreciate it.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t doubt it would\u2019ve been hard to make the kids wait, but he should\u2019ve tried harder. My folks always told me that holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, etc were just numbers on paper. The real celebration can happen any day the family can get together for it. Sometimes it\u2019s early, sometimes late, but it never matters if you communicate deets to the kids, so they know what to expect.", "NTA\n\nI would be just as devastated as you and the exhaustion of night shift would make everything seen even worse than it is... and it's pretty bad.\n\nIs your husband always like this?  Does he ever consider anyone else other than himself?  \n\nI think I would want to head out with the kids for a couple of hours and take them out to breakfast or brunch... or maybe early dinner if you needed to sleep.  Spend some special time with them because their dad already had that special Christmas time with them.\n\nYou may need to have a close look at this relationship.  You would've been studying for a few years and then there's the stress of your grad year and you sound like you might be working full time or close to and still running your family.  It doesn't leave a lot of time to connect with your husband.  Do you need to organise some date nights to reconnect and have someone mind the kids while you do this.  Just that one on one time with each other.  It doesn't have to be a whole weekend but just a couple of hours regularly.\n\nI hope he realises just how hurt you are by this.  If he brushes off your feelings then you have a bigger problem.", "I\u2019m an old lady. I wouldn\u2019t be hurt I\u2019d be angry and his thoughtless a** would know it. NTA", "NTA. Why are you doing all of the work? Time to make some household changes. This seems very one sided.", "NTA - I am in tears right now over how you were treated by this person that is supposed to love you. You, who worked SO hard on Christmas, and SO hard at work... only for this piece of work to do bare minimum for your stocking, take all the glory of the gifts. not even wait FOR THE KIDS' MOTHER to friggan get home, but hey - the rest of the world got to see it happen via his social media.\n\nSo you did ALL the work and were literally dead last on anyone thoughts.\n\nI honestly am not sure I could forgive something like this. It feels so clear how low on the totem pole of importance you were, especially by your own husband. He couldn't be a FATHER or a HUSBAND enough to say the words 'we are waiting for your mother' on the biggest family morning of the entire year.\n\nI would honestly sit the kids down and tell them how much it hurt you as well. In careful words and comparisons, so that they understand this was a big deal. They need to know they hurt you, they were part of this, even though it was to their fault. HE failed you utterly but he made them accomplices by using them as the excuse.\n\nAs for him... I highly suggest a couples therapist if he doesn't understand how grossly he screwed up. Honestly I wouldn't even be able to look at him or speak to him. The relationship would be on the brink of collapse because the emotional and mental weight of this was staggering. And his lack of care in ANY of this would be more worthy of a disliked neighbor than a loving spouse. I would never do a single thing for him again, I would feel so utterly betrayed. In fact I feel that way just reading this - I am... heartbroken for you :(", "NTA. You and your husband need to sit down and have a heart to heart about your expectations for things ahead of time. Did you clearly communicate what you wanted to happen? Even if you didn't, it's clear that he didn't put much thought or time into it. I know the love language books get ragged on a lot here, but maybe is there another way he's trying to express affection that you're not seeing? Otherwise, it seems like he just doesn't care at all.", "Nta kids are compassionate and would absolutely understand to not open presents until Moms home. Your husband is a giant jerk.", "NTA. You were back in the early AM, not that evening, so it wasn\u2019t like they were bouncing off the walls for hours. He could\u2019ve fed them breakfast, even made some for you (which could\u2019ve been part of the loving gesture you were hoping he\u2019d make).  How great if he coached kids on THAT\u2014let\u2019s surprise mom with a special breakfast because she worked hard and still did all these nice things for us to make Christmas special!

It was understood that the latest I would be home is 8am.  When I was growing up my dad worked Night Shift and we all (5 kids in total) waited until he got home before we did presents.

There have been years we did Christmas for New Years... because that's when he came home. The kids opened their stockings and one gift.... then waited for Daddy. The years that he misses the season entirely, I video the entire thing and take pictures for him to see when he comes home. I also send him with \"open on x day\" packages if there is even a chance he will miss an occasion, and we generally do a celebration of some sort either before or after the missed occasions...whichever is closer (so for example, if the deployment starts closer to the occasion than it ends, we do it before. In the case of the reverse, we do it after.) \n\nWe were just at my in-laws' for Christmas, and the kids waited till people got out of the shower, and my father in law got home to open presents. They absolutely examined their stockings from every angle you could imagine...as if they would develop x-ray vision.... but they didn't place one finger on the stockings. My youngest is 5. Generally, Christmas and Easter are the only days they can wake us at the asscrack of dawn, and we get up and begin the festivities, but we do NOT begin till everyone is up and ready. We don't even go down one stair till everyone is lined up youngest to oldest. I have a very firm rule that if you see or open anything before it's time (unless it's through no fault of your own... like maybe I wasn't thinking and called a kid into my room while wrapping presents or something...idk) that you do not get whatever it is. The kids absolutely won't risk a present going back to the store, so they cover their eyes if they even think they MIGHT see a naked present. They may stroke the wrapped gift, pick it up, gently turn it over and over, trying to guess what it may be, but each present stays securely wrapped until I tell them to go. Then, they absolutely tear through it all, but they know my favorite part of any holiday is watching them react to their gifts. They know I spend forever very carefully choosing or making things, ensuring each child has approximately the same amount of gifts, and very close to the same amount spent on them (within a few dollars). They know I create wish lists as I see items, then very carefully pick through the list to choose what I'm going to get them. And they know it would crush me to miss out on their reaction. They do know they can tell me if they don't like it, and I won't be upset (I may be disappointed on the inside, but I don't show it), but I tend to float things casually past them so that doesn't happen often, if at all.", "NTA.

We also put off our Christmas dinner until then as well. The kids were allowed to open their stockings in the morning.\nAs a result of this it meant that even when I didn\u2019t have to work on the day we still tend to follow that routine.

Because they actually appreciate her\u2026\n\nI also find it concerning the kids were so into opening the gifts without mom. She clearly does the lion\u2019s share of the parenting stuff like this if she took them shopping for dad and dad did not do the same for them with mom so they are picking up the dynamic already and normally kids of that age tend to gravitate toward the parent who makes magic happen and they miss. Even if they are still in Santa mode, they really want mom there to show off the Santa presents to because they get more feedback.\n\nBut the fact they were tearing into the presents disinterested in mom when the wait wasn\u2019t huge makes me worry dad played them off and basically told them to open them or his utter lack of respect for his wife as anything other the family PA is already rubbing off on a 6 year and 9 year old and that is a very slippery slope. Alienation can occur while parents are still married and this just has bad vibes beyond Christmas morning about how OP is regarded in her own home.\n\nThe kids are being robbed here too. Dad was Snapchatting their Santa presents instead of being fully engaged? I don\u2019t use Snapchat but I\u2019m sure there is a way you can video or photo real life and upload it to social media later instead of being the parental equivalent of the person filming the concert on their phone and missing the atmosphere.

Then we would open presents and have hot chocolate before I had to be at work at 7.

Because whilst I agree with the rest of the thread that Husband was an AH, you also can't expect everything to go as you wanted.

I don\u2019t get why people don\u2019t want to teach kids patience. Or kindness - it would have been loving and kind of them to wait for Mommy.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t sound like your husband values anything you do or considers you to be a person with feelings and needs. It also doesn\u2019t sound like he contributes to the work of the house. \n\nIf you were single sounds like you\u2019d have the same amount of work but you wouldn\u2019t be sabotaged on Christmas morning.", "NTA but seriously you deserve better. Like a man who will buy you a Christmas gift and not make you feel bad for having literally any expectations.", "NTA he should have waited", "NTA!! How did the world become this place where so many men do the bare minimum and the women bend over backwards to make things beautiful, special, interesting, healthy, educational and loving for our families?? You have every right to be frustrated and angry but don\u2019t give him your tears! Men hate when they aren\u2019t respected so let him know he completely lost yours and maybe he can earn some respect by stepping his lazy A up and doing his part to make sure that you get to enjoy the life you guys have built together every once in a while too. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re sad. I know this scenario all too well.", "You got home before 8am and they couldn\u2019t wait?? That\u2019s totally acceptable. I\u2019m a grown adult and Christmas is magical for me. I would be devastated and you are NTA.", "One Christmas my dad had a work emergency and had to leave in the middle of the night. There were 5 of us kids. My mom made us wait til he got home to open presents. My mom said it was incredibly difficult for her to impose that discipline, but we were a family, and families celebrate together.", "Nta. Wtf is wrong with him", "NTA - okay so look, maybe your husband really was exhausted. But he is a father: every single parent is tired when their kids wake them up at the crack of dawn on Christmas morning. That does not mean his responsibilities as a parent and a husband disappear, and I am fairly certain it would not have been all that difficult to ask your kids to hold off until you got home at 8. He had dozens of options for distracting them - make breakfast, play a game, watch a movie, go play outside or in their rooms, etc. He simply didn\u2019t feel like it because it would have required effort. \n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think he was necessarily being malicious. Just lazy - he was too lazy to distract the kids until you got home. He was too lazy to help with the Christmas shopping. He was too lazy to put a single ounce of thought into your stocking. And he knows he can be lazy about all of that because, despite the fact that you\u2019re working over 70 hours/week at a job that even I - someone who does not work in healthcare - know is overwhelming, he knows you\u2019ll take care of it for him. But the fact that he\u2019s too lazy to give any thought to you or your feelings or needs is unacceptable, especially in a marriage. \n\nI would sit down and ask yourself if you see this lack of care and effort elsewhere. Because as it is, you did all the Christmas shopping for both kids with no help from him, which suggests that maybe there are other parts of parenting he\u2019s \u201ctoo tired\u201d to deal with and leaves to you.", "Not very often, but every once in a while, I read in aita story and it just hits me right in the gut. Makes me feel sick. I feel for you OP. Your husband does not appreciate you. I'd be using this as a wakeup moment and use it to consider how you want to move on with your life. There was no consideration at all for you. NTA", "NTA.\nwow we legit moved Christmas to the 28th because I didn't want my husband who has a weird schedule miss the day.\nIt's not about presents or the food. It's about having family and seeing the joy on everyone's faces:/", "NTA\nFully expect that if you update, it will be after finding out that he knew better and did it anyways because \u201cyou\u2019re never home\u201d like a slimy weasel", "OP you are NTA. This is a massively painful thing to read, let alone experience. Your dynamic seems like one where you carry all the invisible work and your husband takes you for granted.", "NTA. Kids are understanding. My husband and I both worked Christmas morning so we told our 6yo she could open her stocking in the morning but gifts wouldn't happen till the afternoon. She understood that it's a family event. The fact that your kid kept some gifts aside tells me they would have understood as well.", "NTA. My boyfriend is a dairy farmer. We open stockings when the kids wake up and then wait for him to come in after chores to open presents. Chores are generally done around 11am. So we wait until after 11 for opening presents. This is how it will be until they\u2019re either not home for Christmas or we stop growing milk. The husband needs to figure his shit out, because this isn\u2019t ok and this isn\u2019t conducive to family experiences happening as a family", "NTA in anyway. You're husband is a selfish, lazy inconsiderate arse of the highest order. I am so sorry he ruined Christmas for you.", "NTA- why is your employer making you do all those holidays? Usually they rotate. Do you want 6, 12\u2019s in a row? Sorry! I\u2019m a nurse and I just want to make sure your employer isn\u2019t taking advantage since you are a new grad.", "As a mum who also does all the Christmas food shopping, planning and present shopping etc, I would also be absolutely devastated by this. The reason we put so much effort into one day is because of the joy we get out of it in seeing our children and family opening presents and experiencing the magic of Christmas. To miss that is incredibly hurtful and very thoughtless on your husband\u2019s part. He sounds incredibly selfish", "NTA. 7:45 is not that late to wait", "I am so sorry. Reading your story actually made me tear up a bit. You are working so hard, sacrificing a lot already, and still find time to be thoughtful for your family. This one thing was so important to you and your husband completely blew it. It\u2019s like he\u2019s not even thinking of you at all. \n\nNTA but you need to get your husband\u2019s head checked. I hate these posts where women question themselves cause their partner was inconsiderate or a jerk.  please take care of yourself OP. Go relax with a spa day or do something just for you. burn out is real especially for ppl with not a very supportive partner.", "Hey, fellow new nursing grad with an 11 yr old and a 7 yr old. You definitely need a sit down with your husband. It may take a few talks, but you need to clearly lay out the mental weight of all that you have been holding. Disscusion needs to also show that now that you are in a hospital job, the while family will need to adjust accordingly. Before your talk you'll need to do some self work to see what you need (not want because these are fundamental needs that matter to your mental health). In the discussion(s) tell him what you need in very plain language. \"I need you to start considering me more by ______. I considered you by _____, and I need you to try and consider me by _____.\" That can look like having the dishes done because it checks off part of that mental load, or it can be taking on the responsibility of grocery shopping and meal planning, or what ever needs you need met.", "NTA I felt this in my chest as the Santa Claus who is always being forgotten. Your husband is a giant asshole. I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA. My husband is a firefighter who doesnt get home until 9am from 24hr shifts. When he has worked Xmas eve we always wait for him.  Our old house was easy as the tree was in the basement. This house everything is in the main level living room. But the kids usually sleep until 8 anyway. \n\nWhen he works Christmas Santa came on Xmas eve eve.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" and how he is showing our children how I am not a valuable me ever of our family.\" .. YOU WERE NOT THERE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou got a job where you miss all important events in your kids live .. they STILL Get to have christmas, even if YOU priorize your job over being with them.", "> If that was too hard they could have opened one gift each. \n\nThey\u2019re 6 and 9. Sorry that is not \u201ctoo hard.\u201d You\u2019re a parent. Keep them occupied. \n\nHow much do you want to bet it was OP that got them most of the gifts in the first place?\n\nWhen we were kids, my parents worked shift work, and it was not uncommon for us to do it an ENTIRE DAY late and open gifts on the 26th, because none of us would have DREAMED of doing it without one parent there.\n\nIt was not the kids who didn\u2019t want to wait. It was the husband.", "That's the worst part - that it was probably the last year of the eldest really believing.  Depending on factors like when their birthday lands, they're probably going to figure things out either this Easter or right before next Christmas.  The \"big three\" all fall like a stack of cards once they figure one out.  She'll never get that back now.  It was bad enough she couldn't be there when they woke up.\n\nI understand.  Every minute is torture for a kid that young when they can see the gifts there but can't open them, and it seems so horrible to them and like they're being punished when they did nothing wrong.  But they'll forget.  OP won't forget that she missed a precious year when her kids still believed - especially the last year her eldest is going to.\n\nHusband should have mustered the energy to wrangle them.  Get them in front of the TV watching their favorite Rankin-Bass special.  Eldest is old enough to have grasped why they had to wait for Mommy, and once they set the example youngest would likely have fallen in line.\n\nSure it might have been hard.  He may have had to deal with the kids looking at the presents like it would kill them to have to wait one more minute and maybe a few tears, but he's not more exhausted than she is.  They'd have it slightly rough for maybe two hours.  She's going to remember this the rest of her life.", "Definitely NTA - I grew up with/now know a ton of nurses and working Christmas was standard. Though a lot of them grew up under the impression Santa made special trips to deliver presents to nurses kids. But a new nurse should expect to work Christmas and their families need to adjust to that, sucks your husband couldn\u2019t think of you.", "OP got a robe.", "This!!!", "NTA.  OP's husband is a thoughtless, selfish A-H.  I'd add lazy too.  Too lazy to buy her gifts and too lazy to parent the kids until she got home.\n\nShe is clearly taken for granted.", ">\texpectations definitely need to be made clear\n\n**THEY WERE.** You made your expectations *extremely* clear. I don\u2019t even know you and I see clearly what your expectations were. He just didn\u2019t care. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the end of it.

NTA, i'd be remembering this for next year for sure", "[removed]", "I guess I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re focusing exclusively on the young children and not at all on the husband.

Your concept of what is and isn't acceptable relationship dynamics makes me worried for both your own emotion well-being, and the well-being of the people around you, because you simultaneously seem to hold people to incredibly high and incredibly low standards, in a way that is fairly contradictory and, at best, inwardly and outwardly destructive.\n\nI'm actually going to mute responses after this because I really, sincerely feel uncomfortable engaging with you.
