My schedule is six 12 hour night shifts in a row.  My husband works for himself and has 100% autonomy over his schedule.  I worked Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas.  I made sure everything was wrapped and organized so all my husband had to do was place gifts under the tree, fill stockings, and \u201csend back\u201d our snitch from the North Pole.  I did all the shopping and even took our two kids to go pick out gifts for him.  Nothing crazy, but 100% from them with hand written cards.  Also my husband is only responsible for filling my stocking and writing me a letter or card.  I don\u2019t really care about expensive gifts, rather I want to know I was considered and thought about for at least a little bit leading up to Christmas. The shifts leading up to Christmas were a lot and heavy to say the least.  I was so excited to get home Christmas morning and just watch my kids and husband open their gift I put a lot of time and thought into.  So I get home and see my husband outside when I pulled up to our place.  I handed him a cider I picked up in the way home.  He gave me no heads up for what I was about to walk into.  I walk into my living room and my kids were i the middle of the chaos that is Christmas morning.  I instantly began to tear up.  My youngest put aside a few gift to wait for me to watch get opened.  My husband told me he was just so tired and they were so excited he couldn\u2019t make them wait.  I got home at 7:45am. However, he wasn\u2019t too tired to put videos in his Snapchat of them opening gifts.  I tired to explain the hurt to my husband and how he is showing our children how I am not a valuable me ever of our family.  I\u2019m trying to not let this hurt consume me, but I wan devastated and feel like I got robbed of a Christmas with my 6 and 9 year old I will never get back.  He also used left over candy to put in my stocking putting absolutely no thought into it at all.  I did play with them and hangout after wards, but I had to get some sleep before my next shift at 7pm.

I don\u2019t blame him for failing to stop excited kids from opening gifts on Christmas, but how is it ok to you that he does nothing while you work 12h shifts? Even if somehow you\u2019re ok with having a no-good husband, the literal least he could do is have a thoughtful gesture and a gift for you besides leftover candy. You need a partner, not an extra kid", "NTA and you're completely valid. You put in a TON of effort despite your extremely busy schedule so it's understandable that you'd want reap the reward", "So your husband just had to wait until about 7 45 8 o'clock for you to get home to open presents.

As an RN who has worked graveyard shift dozens of times on Christmas Eve, I can assure you that waiting  till you got home (and putting some damned thought into a gift for you) is an absolutely minimal amount of effort for your partner to have put in.  You have every right to be hurt.", "NTA I get it can be difficult restraining kids but you can still restrain them. Yeah sure if you were getting back hours later maybe I could see his point of view but 7.458am is not at all unreasonable.

The bar is way too fucking low in your marriage.", "I am usually not in this camp on these things but NTA.  7:45 is do-able and little kid Christmas mornings are a Big thing.

Next year FIRMLY tell them all they'd better wait for you! In fact, I think you might threaten there won't be a next Christmas if they do that again! \n\nI'm a nurse, done shift work same as you, we've waited as late as supper on Christmas day so everyone would be there! Or the whole Christmas celebration can wait until your day off. \n\nTell them all this was rude and hurtful and better not happen again. Give the 7 year old a little grace, but ....You were treated badly and I'm sorry. As far as im concerned your husband is close to divorce land!", "NTA at all.  I worked night shift for 10\nYears before having a family.  I stay home now, as childcare is more expensive than my salary.  (Yay!). \n\nI absolutely would have been devastated. IDK about you, but our family Santa presents are just left out, unwrapped and this gives the kids stuff to play with while everyone wakes up/showers/parents get breakfast ready etc.    \n\nWe all had to clean up/eat and then presents can happen.   I know a lot of people just tear into it, but forums this works. Some years my husband has to work and we wait for him.  We do toys from Santa heavy those years and then  open presents around 2 when he gets back home.   The children all respect this bc daddy works hard and wants to see them and be part of it.   \n\nI absolutely feel your hurt though.  Our first few years we had a hard time finding OUR mesh of his childhood and mine to tailor and fit our family.  I finally had to have my best friend TELL HIM that he needs to put at least SOMETHING in my stocking- because each parent should get at least one stocking surprise!! \n\nWe all love the excitement and wonder if the holiday, and parents especially miss it.   \n\nI say after your long stretch is over and you\u2019re rested, snuggle up with your honey and tell him how you feel calmly.  Validate that he wanted the kids to have a blast and you appreciate that, however you\u2019d like to come up with a plan for the next time you work. \n\nKeep trucking Momma. Those kids will one day see your hard work and appreciate it.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t doubt it would\u2019ve been hard to make the kids wait, but he should\u2019ve tried harder. My folks always told me that holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, etc were just numbers on paper. The real celebration can happen any day the family can get together for it. Sometimes it\u2019s early, sometimes late, but it never matters if you communicate deets to the kids, so they know what to expect.", "NTA\n\nI would be just as devastated as you and the exhaustion of night shift would make everything seen even worse than it is... and it's pretty bad.\n\nIs your husband always like this?  Does he ever consider anyone else other than himself?  \n\nI think I would want to head out with the kids for a couple of hours and take them out to breakfast or brunch... or maybe early dinner if you needed to sleep.  Spend some special time with them because their dad already had that special Christmas time with them.\n\nYou may need to have a close look at this relationship.  You would've been studying for a few years and then there's the stress of your grad year and you sound like you might be working full time or close to and still running your family.  It doesn't leave a lot of time to connect with your husband.  Do you need to organise some date nights to reconnect and have someone mind the kids while you do this.  Just that one on one time with each other.  It doesn't have to be a whole weekend but just a couple of hours regularly.\n\nI hope he realises just how hurt you are by this.  If he brushes off your feelings then you have a bigger problem.", "I\u2019m an old lady. I wouldn\u2019t be hurt I\u2019d be angry and his thoughtless a** would know it. NTA", "NTA. Why are you doing all of the work? Time to make some household changes. This seems very one sided.", "NTA - I am in tears right now over how you were treated by this person that is supposed to love you. You, who worked SO hard on Christmas, and SO hard at work... only for this piece of work to do bare minimum for your stocking, take all the glory of the gifts. not even wait FOR THE KIDS' MOTHER to friggan get home, but hey - the rest of the world got to see it happen via his social media.\n\nSo you did ALL the work and were literally dead last on anyone thoughts.\n\nI honestly am not sure I could forgive something like this. It feels so clear how low on the totem pole of importance you were, especially by your own husband. He couldn't be a FATHER or a HUSBAND enough to say the words 'we are waiting for your mother' on the biggest family morning of the entire year.\n\nI would honestly sit the kids down and tell them how much it hurt you as well. In careful words and comparisons, so that they understand this was a big deal. They need to know they hurt you, they were part of this, even though it was to their fault. HE failed you utterly but he made them accomplices by using them as the excuse.\n\nAs for him... I highly suggest a couples therapist if he doesn't understand how grossly he screwed up. Honestly I wouldn't even be able to look at him or speak to him. The relationship would be on the brink of collapse because the emotional and mental weight of this was staggering. And his lack of care in ANY of this would be more worthy of a disliked neighbor than a loving spouse. I would never do a single thing for him again, I would feel so utterly betrayed. In fact I feel that way just reading this - I am... heartbroken for you :(", "NTA. You and your husband need to sit down and have a heart to heart about your expectations for things ahead of time. Did you clearly communicate what you wanted to happen? Even if you didn't, it's clear that he didn't put much thought or time into it. I know the love language books get ragged on a lot here, but maybe is there another way he's trying to express affection that you're not seeing? Otherwise, it seems like he just doesn't care at all.", "Nta kids are compassionate and would absolutely understand to not open presents until Moms home. Your husband is a giant jerk.", "NTA. You were back in the early AM, not that evening, so it wasn\u2019t like they were bouncing off the walls for hours. He could\u2019ve fed them breakfast, even made some for you (which could\u2019ve been part of the loving gesture you were hoping he\u2019d make).  How great if he coached kids on THAT\u2014let\u2019s surprise mom with a special breakfast because she worked hard and still did all these nice things for us to make Christmas special!

There have been years we did Christmas for New Years... because that's when he came home. The kids opened their stockings and one gift.... then waited for Daddy. The years that he misses the season entirely, I video the entire thing and take pictures for him to see when he comes home. I also send him with \"open on x day\" packages if there is even a chance he will miss an occasion, and we generally do a celebration of some sort either before or after the missed occasions...whichever is closer (so for example, if the deployment starts closer to the occasion than it ends, we do it before. In the case of the reverse, we do it after.) \n\nWe were just at my in-laws' for Christmas, and the kids waited till people got out of the shower, and my father in law got home to open presents.

Generally, Christmas and Easter are the only days they can wake us at the asscrack of dawn, and we get up and begin the festivities, but we do NOT begin till everyone is up and ready. We don't even go down one stair till everyone is lined up youngest to oldest. I have a very firm rule that if you see or open anything before it's time (unless it's through no fault of your own... like maybe I wasn't thinking and called a kid into my room while wrapping presents or something...idk) that you do not get whatever it is. The kids absolutely won't risk a present going back to the store, so they cover their eyes if they even think they MIGHT see a naked present. They may stroke the wrapped gift, pick it up, gently turn it over and over, trying to guess what it may be, but each present stays securely wrapped until I tell them to go. Then, they absolutely tear through it all, but they know my favorite part of any holiday is watching them react to their gifts. They know I spend forever very carefully choosing or making things, ensuring each child has approximately the same amount of gifts, and very close to the same amount spent on them (within a few dollars). They know I create wish lists as I see items, then very carefully pick through the list to choose what I'm going to get them. And they know it would crush me to miss out on their reaction. They do know they can tell me if they don't like it, and I won't be upset (I may be disappointed on the inside, but I don't show it), but I tend to float things casually past them so that doesn't happen often, if at all.", "NTA.

She clearly does the lion\u2019s share of the parenting stuff like this if she took them shopping for dad and dad did not do the same for them with mom so they are picking up the dynamic already and normally kids of that age tend to gravitate toward the parent who makes magic happen and they miss. Even if they are still in Santa mode, they really want mom there to show off the Santa presents to because they get more feedback.\n\nBut the fact they were tearing into the presents disinterested in mom when the wait wasn\u2019t huge makes me worry dad played them off and basically told them to open them or his utter lack of respect for his wife as anything other the family PA is already rubbing off on a 6 year and 9 year old and that is a very slippery slope. Alienation can occur while parents are still married and this just has bad vibes beyond Christmas morning about how OP is regarded in her own home.\n\nThe kids are being robbed here too. Dad was Snapchatting their Santa presents instead of being fully engaged? I don\u2019t use Snapchat but I\u2019m sure there is a way you can video or photo real life and upload it to social media later instead of being the parental equivalent of the person filming the concert on their phone and missing the atmosphere. That says a lot too\u2026\n\nNTA", "> I just want to know I was thought about.\n\nNTA.  This is literally his one job.  Be a little bit thoughtful.  Get you something you will enjoy.  Wrap it.  And keep the kids occupied until you get home.  Generally.  All that is needed is.  \"We wait for everyone before opening presents.\"  Kids understand.  If and when given that boundary.  They get it.   \n    \nTell him he failed.  As a husband.  And as a father.  Then ask him.  Point blank.  \"How are you going to fix this?\"  \"What can you do to make this better?\"", "You did absolutely nothing wrong. I'm so sorry you weren't treated with the love, respect and consideration you deserve, and that you clearly show everyone else. I'm wondering, is this level of disregard typical of him? You mentioned that.your marriage has been a rollercoaster, but that can mean a lot of things\u2013 I hope he's usually far kinder to you than he was in this instance.", "NTA. I think we\u2019re all getting angry at the husband in solidarity with OP!", "Exactly. Not everyone's gonna be living a the same lifestyle. That means the customs involved in how you celebrate holidays are gonna be tweaked differently. If you're celebrating a holiday that emphasizes coming together and caring about each other, then everyone really should be together as one to celebrate.", "Right? My kids are those exact ages, and they were capable of understanding \"We're waiting til a reasonable hour to get up, and waiting for dad to drag himself out of bed before we start opening things.\" (This was after the 6 year old initially woke us all up at 2:30am because he woke up, saw the presents were out, and assumed it was morning already.) \n\nOP is 1000% NTA and her husband is a truly massive AH. If he's incapable of changing, I see (at the very least) alternating Christmases in his future.", "When I was a kid, I didn\u2019t even have to wait for my mom to get off work. We waited for my parents to decide they were ready for presents. Sometimes this meant we\u2019d get up and have breaks first. Even as a young kid, impatient thought I was, I still knew that no present was opened until the whole family was together and ready. \n\nThe kids definitely would\u2019ve understood the important of waiting for their mom to get off work. I\u2019d be surprised if they didn\u2019t say something."]}
