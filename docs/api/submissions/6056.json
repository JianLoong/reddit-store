My schedule is six 12 hour night shifts in a row.  My husband works for himself and has 100% autonomy over his schedule.  I worked Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas.  I made sure everything was wrapped and organized so all my husband had to do was place gifts under the tree, fill stockings, and \u201csend back\u201d our snitch from the North Pole.  I did all the shopping and even took our two kids to go pick out gifts for him.  Nothing crazy, but 100% from them with hand written cards.  Also my husband is only responsible for filling my stocking and writing me a letter or card.  I don\u2019t really care about expensive gifts, rather I want to know I was considered and thought about for at least a little bit leading up to Christmas. The shifts leading up to Christmas were a lot and heavy to say the least.  I was so excited to get home Christmas morning and just watch my kids and husband open their gift I put a lot of time and thought into.  So I get home and see my husband outside when I pulled up to our place.  I handed him a cider I picked up in the way home.  He gave me no heads up for what I was about to walk into.  I walk into my living room and my kids were i the middle of the chaos that is Christmas morning.  I instantly began to tear up.  My youngest put aside a few gift to wait for me to watch get opened.  My husband told me he was just so tired and they were so excited he couldn\u2019t make them wait.  I got home at 7:45am. However, he wasn\u2019t too tired to put videos in his Snapchat of them opening gifts.  I tired to explain the hurt to my husband and how he is showing our children how I am not a valuable me ever of our family.  I\u2019m trying to not let this hurt consume me, but I wan devastated and feel like I got robbed of a Christmas with my 6 and 9 year old I will never get back.  He also used left over candy to put in my stocking putting absolutely no thought into it at all.  I did play with them and hangout after wards, but I had to get some sleep before my next shift at 7pm.

I don\u2019t blame him for failing to stop excited kids from opening gifts on Christmas, but how is it ok to you that he does nothing while you work 12h shifts? Even if somehow you\u2019re ok with having a no-good husband, the literal least he could do is have a thoughtful gesture and a gift for you besides leftover candy. You need a partner, not an extra kid", "NTA and you're completely valid. You put in a TON of effort despite your extremely busy schedule so it's understandable that you'd want reap the reward", "So your husband just had to wait until about 7 45 8 o'clock for you to get home to open presents.

As an RN who has worked graveyard shift dozens of times on Christmas Eve, I can assure you that waiting  till you got home (and putting some damned thought into a gift for you) is an absolutely minimal amount of effort for your partner to have put in.  You have every right to be hurt.", "NTA I get it can be difficult restraining kids but you can still restrain them. Yeah sure if you were getting back hours later maybe I could see his point of view but 7.458am is not at all unreasonable.

The bar is way too fucking low in your marriage.", "I am usually not in this camp on these things but NTA.  7:45 is do-able and little kid Christmas mornings are a Big thing.

Next year FIRMLY tell them all they'd better wait for you! In fact, I think you might threaten there won't be a next Christmas if they do that again! \n\nI'm a nurse, done shift work same as you, we've waited as late as supper on Christmas day so everyone would be there! Or the whole Christmas celebration can wait until your day off. \n\nTell them all this was rude and hurtful and better not happen again. Give the 7 year old a little grace, but ....You were treated badly and I'm sorry. As far as im concerned your husband is close to divorce land!", "NTA at all.  I worked night shift for 10\nYears before having a family.  I stay home now, as childcare is more expensive than my salary.  (Yay!). \n\nI absolutely would have been devastated. IDK about you, but our family Santa presents are just left out, unwrapped and this gives the kids stuff to play with while everyone wakes up/showers/parents get breakfast ready etc.    \n\nWe all had to clean up/eat and then presents can happen.   I know a lot of people just tear into it, but forums this works. Some years my husband has to work and we wait for him.  We do toys from Santa heavy those years and then  open presents around 2 when he gets back home.   The children all respect this bc daddy works hard and wants to see them and be part of it.   \n\nI absolutely feel your hurt though.  Our first few years we had a hard time finding OUR mesh of his childhood and mine to tailor and fit our family.  I finally had to have my best friend TELL HIM that he needs to put at least SOMETHING in my stocking- because each parent should get at least one stocking surprise!! \n\nWe all love the excitement and wonder if the holiday, and parents especially miss it.   \n\nI say after your long stretch is over and you\u2019re rested, snuggle up with your honey and tell him how you feel calmly.  Validate that he wanted the kids to have a blast and you appreciate that, however you\u2019d like to come up with a plan for the next time you work. \n\nKeep trucking Momma. Those kids will one day see your hard work and appreciate it.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t doubt it would\u2019ve been hard to make the kids wait, but he should\u2019ve tried harder. My folks always told me that holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, etc were just numbers on paper. The real celebration can happen any day the family can get together for it. Sometimes it\u2019s early, sometimes late, but it never matters if you communicate deets to the kids, so they know what to expect.", "NTA\n\nI would be just as devastated as you and the exhaustion of night shift would make everything seen even worse than it is... and it's pretty bad.\n\nIs your husband always like this?  Does he ever consider anyone else other than himself?  \n\nI think I would want to head out with the kids for a couple of hours and take them out to breakfast or brunch... or maybe early dinner if you needed to sleep.  Spend some special time with them because their dad already had that special Christmas time with them.\n\nYou may need to have a close look at this relationship.  You would've been studying for a few years and then there's the stress of your grad year and you sound like you might be working full time or close to and still running your family.  It doesn't leave a lot of time to connect with your husband.  Do you need to organise some date nights to reconnect and have someone mind the kids while you do this.  Just that one on one time with each other.  It doesn't have to be a whole weekend but just a couple of hours regularly.\n\nI hope he realises just how hurt you are by this.  If he brushes off your feelings then you have a bigger problem.", "I\u2019m an old lady. I wouldn\u2019t be hurt I\u2019d be angry and his thoughtless a** would know it. NTA", "NTA. Why are you doing all of the work? Time to make some household changes. This seems very one sided.", "NTA - I am in tears right now over how you were treated by this person that is supposed to love you. You, who worked SO hard on Christmas, and SO hard at work... only for this piece of work to do bare minimum for your stocking, take all the glory of the gifts. not even wait FOR THE KIDS' MOTHER to friggan get home, but hey - the rest of the world got to see it happen via his social media.\n\nSo you did ALL the work and were literally dead last on anyone thoughts.\n\nI honestly am not sure I could forgive something like this. It feels so clear how low on the totem pole of importance you were, especially by your own husband. He couldn't be a FATHER or a HUSBAND enough to say the words 'we are waiting for your mother' on the biggest family morning of the entire year.\n\nI would honestly sit the kids down and tell them how much it hurt you as well. In careful words and comparisons, so that they understand this was a big deal. They need to know they hurt you, they were part of this, even though it was to their fault. HE failed you utterly but he made them accomplices by using them as the excuse.\n\nAs for him... I highly suggest a couples therapist if he doesn't understand how grossly he screwed up. Honestly I wouldn't even be able to look at him or speak to him. The relationship would be on the brink of collapse because the emotional and mental weight of this was staggering. And his lack of care in ANY of this would be more worthy of a disliked neighbor than a loving spouse. I would never do a single thing for him again, I would feel so utterly betrayed. In fact I feel that way just reading this - I am... heartbroken for you :(", "NTA. You and your husband need to sit down and have a heart to heart about your expectations for things ahead of time. Did you clearly communicate what you wanted to happen? Even if you didn't, it's clear that he didn't put much thought or time into it. I know the love language books get ragged on a lot here, but maybe is there another way he's trying to express affection that you're not seeing? Otherwise, it seems like he just doesn't care at all.", "Nta kids are compassionate and would absolutely understand to not open presents until Moms home. Your husband is a giant jerk.", "NTA. You were back in the early AM, not that evening, so it wasn\u2019t like they were bouncing off the walls for hours. He could\u2019ve fed them breakfast, even made some for you (which could\u2019ve been part of the loving gesture you were hoping he\u2019d make).  How great if he coached kids on THAT\u2014let\u2019s surprise mom with a special breakfast because she worked hard and still did all these nice things for us to make Christmas special!

So seems like you need your kids terrified of you and punished and forced to stay in bed!\n\nYou sound like fun!", "Nope, he doesn't get a pass. \n\nHe is a FATHER and a HUSBAND\n\nBoth those rolls he accepted. He has responsibilities due to that. \n\nOne of those responsibilities is to appreciate his wife's work and effort. To show that love and appreciation infront of his children. \n\nHe failed.", "NTA. He could have made them wait but didn't. My twins are 8 and I have always made them wait until the grandparents arrive to open presents which is usually around 8:30 or so. I even held off my nieces one Christmas who wanted to open presents at 5:30 am. He just didn't want to be an enforcer.", "He put in 0%.\n\n\nHe took out 100%.  The joy of watching them open everything.  The \u201ccredit\u201d when he posted on social media.  The \u201cglory\u201d in the kids\u2019 eyes for giving them all the gifts. \n\n\nYou gave 100% (mental labor thinking of gifts, physical labor buying and wrapping gifts, not to mention busting your butt at your job that likely paid for said gifts), and got 0%.\n\n\nIt will take a lot to forgive this. And honestly - it shows the type of person he is.", "A little clarification:\n\nMy husband and I talked about how Christmas morning would go.  My children were even aware that when I got home it was game time.  I even called him during my shift to make sure he didn\u2019t fall asleep before finishing his Christmas duties.  It was understood that the latest I would be home is 8am.  When I was growing up my dad worked Night Shift and we all (5 kids in total) waited until he got home before we did presents.  We have had 12 Christmas mornings together prior to this one.  \n\nAs far as a present goes I really could give two shits about how much money is spent.  I just want to know I was thought about. Literally a letter in a piece of paper would have been amazing.  Yes my 6 year old showed some restraint and saved some presents for me to open.  Which made my mama heart ache a little less.  I have talked with my kids and explained why this was so upsetting for me.  I am confident my kids get it now.  \n\nWe are having growing pains as a family with my transition into working full time as a RN.  For those of you who don\u2019t know, two years of nursing school during a pandemic was fucking brutal! \n\nI have been married to my husband for over a decade.  Our marriage has been a roller coaster, but so has life.  Expectations definitely need to be made clear.  I just really needed outsiders evaluations.  I am very big in trying to fix my short comings and any wrong doings that I am responsible in this whole mess.  Sometimes I let the hurt blind me and needed some clarity.  \n\nI\u2019ll try and update when I can\u2026", "NTA; but your husband really messed up. Seriously; i thought you were going to say you got home at 12p or something. Seriously not even 8a. He should have said we wait for mom to come home. \nKids get told all the time, wait for so-so to wake up. Shower. Eat breakfast first... Its torture but it grows the anticipation. 8a was not to long to wait", "NTA!!!", "Wow, I worked nights for years when my kids were young and my husband AND kids always waited for me to be there to celebrate Christmas if I had to work. Even young children  get it, your husband didn't even try. \n\nA simple message to a 6 and 9 year to say, \"Hey let's wait for Mommy so we can do this together, won't that be so much better?\" Or \" While we wait for Mommy let's make her a nice breakfast to come home to as present after she worked so hard last night. Then she can sit with us while we open presents.\"\n\nBoth things my husband did. It's not rocket science just some empathy and caring for your wife. Teaching your kids some skills along the way as well.\n\nSo sorry your husband was a total asshat.", "NTA. And a 9 year old and 6 year old can definitely wait til 8 am to open gifts! We aren\u2019t talking toddlers here!", "NTA. OP I\u2019m so sorry. This post was heart breaking. I can fully empathize with how badly your hurting. I imagine this hurt may never fully go away, but it will lessen with time. You missed a very special moment, that you put countless hours, love, and effort into. All because your husband couldn\u2019t put in enough thought/energy into making the kids wait. The cherry on top is how thoughtless his stocking for you was. Did he actually think that was an acceptable gift for his wife and mother of his children? All I can say is I\u2019m so sorry and you are completely valid in your hurt, anger, and sadness. Sending you love and hugs \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA Your SO royally screwed up. Next year, the husband and kids can make a holiday breakfast if they need to wait OP to come home from work. This will keep everyone busy and out of the Christmas tree.\n\nIn order to stay married at the present moment, his lazy butt should go buy a decent gift for OP. That\u2019s just AH behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s not that hard to do the right thing but some people never figure it out.", "You have every right to be hurt. So NTA.  And why is this jackass tired? You did EVERYTHING!!!!  Please don't let this go.", "NTA. I feel you.. This happened to me this year too \nWe do all the work of the holidays.. They do nothing. They barely even think to get us a gift. Forget stuff my stocking. Never has. I quit hanging it and actually gave my special Christmas stocking away this year.\nWatching their joyful faces. THAT is our Christmas gift. The joy and the love.\nI'm sorry. It hurts", "Next time there is a special occasion make him do the preparation.  When he screws it up ask why was it so hard you do it all the time successfully", "NTA\nWe never had Christmas before noon growing up because my dad worked graveyard. It meant breakfast in bed on Christmas morning and watching Christmas movies with mom while waiting for him. No one was permanently scarred.", "> I made sure everything was wrapped and organized so all my husband had to do was place gifts under the tree, fill stockings, and \u201csend back\u201d our snitch from the North Pole. I did all the shopping and even took our two kids to go pick out gifts for him\n\n\nYTA why does he have to do nothing?? Insane.\n\nYou already let him walk all over you, what do you expect?", "NTA the fact you didn't go nuclear on your selfish AH of a husband in front of your kids is a freaking Christmas miracle. I would have had all his shit on the lawn.", "NTA!!! I worked til 8am Christmas morning and rushed him and got there around 8:20. My husband waited for me so I could enjoy Christmas with my son!", "urgh. YTA you arent even doing proper childcare and you call yourself a nurse? take some responsibility for your family and you are blaming your husband?", "When I was young, still believing in Santa age, my dad would have to work Xmas day and would tske a long lunch to come home to open presents with us.\nUsually around 9 or 10 or whenever he could get the time (he was a cop) but we would wait patiently and never even thought of opening anything without him....my mom wouldn't have even suggested it!!!", "I would let him do all the work of organizing Xmas next year and frankly, his gift should be what he gave you this year (nothing). I am so over people who know that gifts are expected yet they do absolutely zero for their partner. It\u2019s impersonal but at bare minimum get gift cards, good candy, and a few small items that speak to their interests.", "> I am very big in trying to fix my short comings and any wrong doings\n\nToo bad your husband isn't.\n\nStop pinning yourself to the cross expecting the absolute bare minimum. Women need to stop tolerating weaponized incompetence from men in general, husbands are always acting like it's so hard to think up a nice gift yet expect their wives to get good presents for half the neighborhood. You're married to a bump on a log who needs to do better. Stop acting like you don't deserve better.", "NTA. The only one with the short comings is your husband. He failed you, big time.", "Plenty of families do something like stockings or the Santa gift, then breakfast before presents (makes the suspense last). But you're 100% correct. He could have reminded them that they are waiting for mommy this year, had them help make some breakfast or do something nice for when OP got home.", "legit! She did an exhausting job which is often more intense over the holidays due to drinking etc and had to do ALL the planning and organising for \"magical\" vibes for Christmas despite him being abel to set his own hours and then he had THE NERVE to say he was too tired to wait an hour for her to come home.   \n\n\nI would be getting therapy over this", "I think it was \"that SHE Wrapped\"", "My ex MIL has been a nurse for decades, mostly on nights. Her husband is the living worst, and even he had the kids wait for her to get home before opening the presents she bought and wrapped.", "That\u2019s what burned me too - the \u2018I\u2019m such a great (single) dad\u2019 on her hard work.  The jerk did absolutely nothing but took the credit.", "I meant a gender neutral singular \u2018they\u2019, since OP didn\u2019t specify."]}
