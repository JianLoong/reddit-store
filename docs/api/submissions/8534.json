I made a big spread ensuring there were clearly labelled vegan options and everything was going fine until one of the girls approached me asking what was gluten free.

The audacity of this mother to get upset after you were incredibly accommodating to her child despite not knowing of her restriction beforehand. \n\nI had a sensitivity to dairy as a child which posed problems at most parties because what do they serve? pizza. and most pizzas have a shit load of cheese. Not an issue for the most part because my allergy wasn't crazy severe and as long as I picked the cheese off I didn't see as big of a reaction (if at all).
