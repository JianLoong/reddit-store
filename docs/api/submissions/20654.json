Best of luck to both you and him, and I hope your daughter finds a good treatment regimen soon.", "Do you think your brother holds resentment towards you in general, especially when it came to your epilepsy? His comment about how he dealt with enough seizures for a lifetime sounds like he resents you because your epilepsy somehow affected his life negatively. Maybe your parents ignored him a lot to deal with your epilepsy? Nevertheless, him and his fianc\u00e9e are still AHs for how they\u2019re handling your decision to not go to their wedding. It\u2019s not your fault that you and your daughter have life threatening illnesses and can\u2019t join their wedding which they said was going to happen in 2 weeks instead of 2 years. They gave you no time to find someone you trust to watch your daughter, and since their wedding is child free, they gotta realize that not everyone that they want to go can\u2019t go due to that rule. Either they make an exception for you so you can bring your daughter or they have to accept the fact you can\u2019t go. Their comments about the epilepsy are also not okay.

I can't even count how often I saw people not getting such, well, since the internet.\n\nMaybe it is a cultural thing, I mean we Germans are not wrongly known for being stoical, to put it into an euphemism, lol. Like when I was a child, five or six years old, I was at a childfree wedding (teenagers were allowed) and they weren't even relatives but the bride was the neighbour's daughter who knew me since I was born. They made that exception for me because I was the most silent child who could just sit and listen people talking or just entertain myself - and not a single parent there was angry about it because they understood that childfree does not mean hating kids but avoiding disturbances and that they definitely knew I would be none - and the other way around not attending when it's childfree is also just a consequence of the circumstances.\n\nYeah I am wandering, sorry, but I just think people should realise that not everything is a personal thing but far more often consequences like me being known that extremely silent girl had the positive consequence I was allowed at the wedding. And it is so stupid of OP's brother not to see that since one could ask him if his childfree decision was out of spite - I mean it works both ways to claim a reasonable decision some stupid personal thing.", "Ugh preach! We got married two weeks before my sister in law who already has two children. She decided she wanted a child free wedding AFTER sending out invitations and I said you absolutely cannot do that.
