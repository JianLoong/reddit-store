I hope someday if you become a parent you will then understand.", "NTA. Tell your brother the world doesn't revolve around his shot-gun wedding.", "NTA - Two weeks is a ridiculous amount of warning time, child issue or not.", "NTA - \"Sorry, the world does not revolve around your wedding\"", "NTA. People have the right to a child free wedding, but the flip side is that they have to understand that people may not be able to come. You can't make demands and then be mad that people can't comply.", "Absolutely NTA. The world doesn't revolve around your child, true, but right now YOUR world does revolve around your child. The world also doesn't revolve around his wedding either. \nThis is not a case of you just not wanting to bother with a sitter. Your child has seizures for crying out loud! To top it off, it's not well managed yet and she's not old enough to tell anyone when she thinks she might be about to have one. I wouldn't leave my child with a sitter 3 hours away if I was you either. \nPart of having children is dealing with medical issues, and I can't imagine how hard this must be for you right now. \nPart of having a child free wedding is accepting the fact that some family members won't be able to attend. If they can't accept that, that's their problem, not yours. \nTake care of your baby girl and tell your brother and soon-to-be SIL that you're not risking your child's health to satisfy them.", "NTA, one more story that makes me happy I haven't been to a wedding in 20 years, and don't have kids. Thanks Reddit, and my urologist!", "NTA. They\u2019re entitled to have a child free wedding but they can\u2019t get upset if people don\u2019t want/can\u2019t come.", "NTA but he and his fianc\u00e9 sound like spoiled children playing house. Your toddler has epilepsy, which is new for her and for you. Of course you don't feel comfortable having a sitter and they gave basically no notice for the wedding. Take care of your girl and don't at all feel badly about your decision to stay home.", "NTA\n\nEven if your daughter hadn\u2019t just received the epilepsy diagnosis you wouldn\u2019t be TA. They gave 2 week\u2019s notice. Who does that????\n\nHe can say the world doesn\u2019t revolve around your kid but it doesn\u2019t revolve around him or his teenage bride either.", "NTA- Your husband is working, your parents will be attending, it seems like all of the humans you\u2019d trust to take care of her aren\u2019t able to babysit.  It\u2019s not a normal situation and your brother and bride are not being gracious at all about her diagnosis and the impact of that on your family. Your daughter comes first. Plus they gave a two weeks notice for a child free event.  They get what they get and you don\u2019t throw a fit. \n\nHopefully with time they will see what assfaces they are being. Good for you for saying no.", "NTA. \n\nI had a child free wedding. One of the things you need to accept when making the choice to do that is that there are simply going to be people with kids who don't want to or cannot make that wedding. It's unfair of the bride and groom to then take offence of that. ESPECIALLY given the circumstances.", "NTA I\u2019m not sure it would go even if she were allowed. Idk how often she has seizures, but you probably wouldn\u2019t want to deal with that during a wedding. And it sounds like he\u2019d be pissed if she drew attention away.", "NTA.\n\nYour 2-year-old needs you physically more than your brother needs you. They can stream it and you can attend it virtually, but I think you being responsible and wanting to be there for your daughter in case anything happens triumphs over everything else.\n\nThey gave little notice and knows you have a child with epilepsy. It wasn't considerate of you (which is their right because it's their wedding), but you're uncomfortable leaving her for almost a whole/half day. Listen to your discomfort, and sorry but the world doesn't revolve around him or his wife. Him and his fiancee sound like they need to grow up unfortunately. \n\nThe fact that your parents also understand your decision is right on the money to say you're NTA because they're actual parents too, they understand they have responsibilities as parents. Your brother does not.", "NTA. Invitations are not legal summons. They gave you little notice and I doubt that you'll be the first person to decline the invitation for whatever reason. Your brother sounds immature and your fiancee seems to be following suite. If he's going to be away then he has no right to comment as he can't help you either.", "NTA. They are entitled to have a child-free wedding. However, they also need to understand that you are entitled to decline an invitation to their wedding *for whatever reason you choose.* An invitation isn't a subpoena. You aren't obligated to attend. You definitely are well within your rights to put your child's health concerns over your brother's wedding. You brother and future sil should understand that if they choose to have a child-free wedding then some parents might just choose to come. The AHs here are your brother and his fiancee for guilt tripping you about choosing not to attend.", "NTA. You are letting your brother know in advance that you wont be attending and respecting his decision to have a childfree wedding. Your kid is your priority and is important you take good care of her so wanting to stay is super reasonable, and the fact that your kid is more important for you than this event is okay too. The world does not revolve around his wedding either, and you are being fully responsible.", "NTA.  Your child has a serious medical condition that even many sitters would be reluctant to deal with.  She comes first vs. attending a wedding.  Also the challenge of child-free weddings of close relatives is that most of your usual babysitters will be attending.\n\nI'm more sus of the short notice wedding however.  Maybe that is why the fiancee is upset because she's nervous about something being exposed and they need to tie the knot asap and wants you there for cred.", "NTA\n\nA wedding invitation is a INVITATION not a demand to appear. Anyone can RSVP no for any reason, and you've got a very valid reason here. I would not be leaving a 2yo with newly diagnosed epilepsy with a sitter either particularly since family sitters aren't going to be an option because duh, family wedding.", "I\u2019m sorry about your daughter\u2019s diagnosis. Having epilepsy yourself and knowing all that entails, it must be twice as scary.\n\nIf I, a stranger on the internet, can figure that out, there\u2019s no excuse for your brother. Your baby\u2019s uncle, who should show at least a modicum of concern.\n\nBut based on the response coming from the barely adult couple, I doubt they have the maturity to respond any other way. But they probably don\u2019t have the maturity to get married to begin with and the marriage may not last a hell of a lot longer than the 2 week engagement.\n\nTell your brother you\u2019ll make up for it at his next wedding.\n\nNTA", " \"sorry the world doesn't revolve around your kid\"\n\nActually bro - mine does...... have a great wedding", "NTA-sounds like the 20yo has a lot of growing up to do.", "NTA. You're a very good person and a very good parent. I'm gonna chalk up your brother's reaction to age-related ignorance, since he's 20 (imagine getting married at 20, not me *cries*). Anyway, you're doing right by your child, and that's what matters.", "NTA people have the right to have child free weddings. But by doing so they must accept that people will often decline the invite for various reasons. You have a bloody big valid reason, you daughter needs you right now. \n\nYour brother and his girlfriend are TA, the world doesn't revolve around their wants. Its purely childish to throw a tantrum and call people names based on decisions they made. Maybe the happy couple should grow up a bit and stop acting like the children they don't want at the wedding.", "Was ready to call you soft y.t.a. from the title, but after reading your explanation, totally NTA. You're going through a scary time with your daughter and of course you won't want to be too far. If the wedding was closer from home, could be doable I guess, with a very trusted babysitter, but three hours away is a bit too much.", "NTA\nYour daughter is ill. It is reasonable to choose to stay with her.", "NTA\n\nThey have the right to host a child free event, and you have the right to not attend because it impacts you.", "NTA.", "He's right that the world doesn't revolve around your kid, but it doesn't revolve around him either.", "Nta the world also doesn't revolve around his last minute wedding.  Perhaps a compromise could be reached with all of you going but you or your spouse missing the reception part or taking turns to be with your daughter, if not, your daughter comes first. If he doesn't understand that's okay, he's entitled to his feelings, but it doesn't make you wrong", "NTA - he can easily make an exception for your unique needs if he wants you there as this is at an estate and not some venue with their own rules.  You should absolutely prioritize your child.", "NTA.   Especially 3 hours away", "Tell him you'll come to the next one, doesn't sound like a great start to a marriage tbh.  \nNTA, I wouldn't leave my sick baby to go to a wedding 3 hours away either. When you choose to have a childfree wedding, a valid choice, you also need to accept that some parents cannot or will not make your wedding a priority over their child. Your brother and his fiancee are TAs here. Uncle is fine with leaving a baby, who could have a seizure, with no parent for at least what, 8-10 hours?", "NTA. I was initially going to go with N A H until your brother reacted the way that he did. He has every right to have a child free wedding, but he has to understand that doing so might prevent some people from being able to attend.\n\nIs there any sort of compromise where you could hang out in the back of the ceremony with your daughter and then head home before the reception? That way, you can still at least be present for the wedding itself and be in any family pictures or otherwise. At least for people I know who have gone child free, their main concern was not having kids screaming during the ceremony, and also not having kids running around during the reception.", "YTA", "Have you tried a ketogenic diet?\n\nIn 1/3 of patients, the seizures stop. In 1/3 of patients, the seizures lessen. In 1/3 of patients, no improvement, but nothing lost.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
