If my perfectionist, anxiety ridden sister could organize a wedding where those with kids simply peacefully faded away from the proceedings when the time was right (and to be clear, this was not a small event, it took place in a fucking *palace*), then other people can stop making their weddings so egomaniacal too.", "I heard of them, but I never knew anyone who had one.

Others envision a wedding as an exquisite ceremony in which no possible cry or fuss mars the focus, followed by a sophisticated adult party with drinking and ballroom dancing the central elements of the occasion. \n\nThere's not really anything wrong with either one; but the people who think a wedding is category A are less likely to know people who think a wedding is category B well enough to be invited to their weddings very often, and vice versa.

I'm very much in category A, and I've never been invited to a childfree wedding. I understand that they exist and I don't object to them -- it's up to the couple getting married, and if they don't invite my children that's their choice. But it just hasn't come up. My friends and family are pretty similar to me in their approach to weddings, and we have big friendly, casual gatherings with friends signing up to sing for each other instead of a hired band or DJ, and clothes more along the lines of tie-dye and beads than formalwear.

That was the only child in the family, save for a couple infant/toddler kids of my sister's friends, and it was easier to just specify \"no kids\" rather than singling out one specific hellion child. There was a thread in an open forum in this sub back in January last year where someone pointed out there seems to have been a cultural shift that sometimes necessitates childfree weddings - there used to be a social contract where parents understood that if their child started screaming, running around, was throwing food or touching other people etc. it was time to remove them from the situation to calm down. Now that's just called \"being a kid\" and \"having big feelings\". My partner's brother's soon-to-be-stepdaughter yells at other people, tells them what to do, spits on and bites people, and her mother constantly posts things on Facebook about how \"I will not teach my daughter to 'be polite'\" as if it's some feminist issue (you know, because nobody thinks a little boy screaming orders at people and hitting people is bad). At Christmas her mother yelled at me because her daughter grabbed something of mine and walked away with it, I politely asked for it back, and the daughter started screamcrying.
