I pay all that myself, as thank you for hooking us up with this connection on the accommodations. \n\nAnyway, holiday is great, drinks, clubs, shopping all the things two women in their 20s do on holidays. \n\nThe last night we were there, she springs on me that she wants to give the woman who offered the house a few hundred euros as a thank you. I said I didn\u2019t have the money to do that, as it was never in my budget to begin with. The subject was dropped. \n\nWe fly home today, we drive from the airport home and then I get a text message saying she was going to give the woman \u20ac500, because \u201cit\u2019s the right thing to do\u201d \nI explain once again, I do not have the money to give her \u20ac250. And told her it wasn\u2019t fair to spring this on me after we hard already gone on the trip. \nI told her if I had known it was gonna cost me this much more I would have taken the money for the flights and car and gone to a cheaper destination within that budget. \n\nShe said I have to pay her back because it\u2019s the right thing to do. \nI have offered her \u20ac100 to cover the electric or whatever because that\u2019s all I can afford. But she still keeps saying I can just say her back in instalments. \n\nSo Reddit, Am I The Asshole?\n\nEdit: Update: Thank you all so much for your help on this and i appreciate all the comments and advice so much. I have text her about the car rental price, and I will update again later today with a response from her.\nThank you again everyone.", "created_utc": 1693169576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1631pqt/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_friend_half_of_the/", "score": 196, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is that close to the 250 she wants you to chip in towards the 'rental'? Just say: \"I disagree that we should pay someone for staying in their place when they offered us to use it for free, although I think that sending her a bottle of wine or some fancy chocolates as a 'thank you' would be a nice gesture. This is something you could do considering this is your friend/contact. If you want to throw her some cash, that is your decision, but I will not pay towards that. Note that I already spent X on the car and insurance that we both used during our trip, so I think my financial contribution to our shared holiday is already sufficient. I didn't ask you to pay towards the car as it is my way of repaying you for inviting me to stay at what I was told would be free accommodation.\"\n\nIt would have been nice if you two had bought a small long-life/non-perishable thank-you gift that you could have left in the house when you two left. But as this is her contact, she can do this now after the fact. Considering you paid for a car, I don't think you are obliged to pay towards anything, not even a thank-you gift.\n\nAlso, how do you know that she would transfer any money you transfer to her, to her friend? I had roommates who claimed that after we moved out, the landlady had to pay for renting a car to get rid of our waste (we left the place spotless). I had already paid towards some minor wear to a carpet, I thought that was fair, but I wasn't going to pay for some BS story, so I asked my housemates to ask the landlady for a receipt for the car rental. Of course I never got that, so I never paid them. I don't know if this was a cash grab from the landlady or my housemates (I didn't know them that well) but I wasn't there for it.", "NTA. The \"right thing to do\" would be for her to honor her word that the accommodations were free. You owe her nothing and should not go along with this cash grab that you never agreed to and never had any input into.\n\nIt's at least questionable whether this money would ever make it to your hosts, even if you did pay her.", "NTA. It\u2019s a nice gesture for her to want to pay the family friend and it may indeed be \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d. However, she needed to let you know about this beforehand. Trying to retroactively change the rules and make you pay is ridiculous. If she wants to pay the friend, she should foot the whole bill.", "NTA. You're not obligated to do anything more, financially, than you already have. You already told A that you couldn't afford what she wanted to pay, and she proceeded to pay it anyway, and is now asking you for the money. There was no agreement for this, not even a verbal one. It may turn out that you and A stop speaking to one another, but she needs to learn that she cannot force people into financial agreements when they've already said no.", "NTA. \n\nThis wasn't agreed beforehand, so nope.\n\nI'd figure out how much you paid for the car and be like, the right thing to do is for you to pay half. So...\nHere you go. You pay me and I'll pay you.", "NTA. You rented the car and paid the ins. That's enough. Tell her had it come up before you could have discussed an agreed upon amount but she doesn't get to decide then make you pay. Do not send her any money", "NTA. But you need to say \u201cso do you also think it is the right thing to do to pay me for half the car and gas because that comes to $X. Thanks!\u201d", "NTA: This should have been discussed before. You paid for the car rental. Is that more or less than the 250 she wants you to pay? Tell her to take her half of the car rental and use it to give to her friend.", "NTA.  Send her a bill for half of the car rental and insurance.", "NTA. Don't give her a penny. She just wants money from you despite having no trouble with you paying for use of the car she was transported in.\n\nHave you asked why she didn't bring up giving the host money before booking the trip?
