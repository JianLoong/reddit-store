Further, that sends a really bad message to your kids that bullying behavior is not only ok, it should be enabled. \n\nPrivately, tell your wife that you are disappointed that not only does she enable her mother's bad behavior, especially her disrespect of you, but it makes you ssd that your wife actually expects you to cooperate with and enable the person who is bullying you. Point out that you would never allow anyone to bully your wife. You would have her back. And you certainly would never expect your wife to politrly tolerate someone who is bullying her. Your wife will probably not take this well, but hopefully she'll start thinking about her own behavior. \n\nThen call a family meeting with your wife and kids and say that after 20 years of your MIL's disrespectful behavior, you have come to realize that she is a bully and tolerating her behavior only enables her and encourages her to victimize people. Tell your kids that you regret enabling your MIL for 20 years and apologize for pressuring them to enable their grandmother's bad behavior.
