She told her daughter's children's father that no one would miss him. It's rude, it's uncalled for, and it's wrong. Obviously, your children feel differently about her now. You definitely deserve an apology. She is a whole adult and she should know better than to make those sorts of comments, and that when you hurt someone, you have to apologize. Seems like your kids already know this. I don't even like my dad half the time and still wouldn't want to be around someone who felt comfortable saying that to someone else. What your kids do with the information you gave them (which they might have figured out on their own eventually if you hadn't told them) is not on you."]}
