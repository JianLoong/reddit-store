What's more, you obviously didn't accept his daughter as part of the new family that you were making with him -- you would accept an adopted child, of neither of your genetics, but you wouldn't accept the daughter he already brought to your marriage as the child who could help you fulfill your wishes. \n\nWhy? Because she already had a mother? There's no child ever born who can't use more adults who love them and help take care of them, no matter how many they already have.

You're treating your -- yes, YOUR -- stepdaughter as if she were nothing to you, and you shouldn't. Your husband is treating the son he allowed you to adopt against his better judgment as if he were nothing to him, and he shouldn't. \n\nBut you're the one who forced this whole situation to take place to begin with, by responding to having conflicting wishes on a deal breaking subject as a reason to pressure your partner into obeying your wishes.
