What's more, you obviously didn't accept his daughter as part of the new family that you were making with him -- you would accept an adopted child, of neither of your genetics, but you wouldn't accept the daughter he already brought to your marriage as the child who could help you fulfill your wishes. \n\nWhy? Because she already had a mother? There's no child ever born who can't use more adults who love them and help take care of them, no matter how many they already have.

You're treating your -- yes, YOUR -- stepdaughter as if she were nothing to you, and you shouldn't. Your husband is treating the son he allowed you to adopt against his better judgment as if he were nothing to him, and he shouldn't. \n\nBut you're the one who forced this whole situation to take place to begin with, by responding to having conflicting wishes on a deal breaking subject as a reason to pressure your partner into obeying your wishes.

Then she *ignored his kid as if she didn't count!* ***OP did what*** ***she*** ***planned along to do against his wishes.***\n\n***Being a parent entails a lot of time, dedication & sacrifice. I don't get that OP doesn't understand that. It seemed minute got a child forgot the other one existed!*** \n\nFor the most part there is no instructional manner stating how to deal with varying ages & personalities. OP has been focused exclusively on the boy to point ignoring the *other* child. The husband notices & apparently the daughter too. ***That's very disturbing she's blatantly trying to make this child her & husband's 'golden' child!***\n\nBased on the anecdotal evidence OP has stated, it's solely on basic attention a parent gives to their child rather than ignoring or neglecting another.

Because many times they're supposed to stand there while the wife/SO actually makes the decisions, rather corrects his choices for their choices. ***BYW, did anyone notice the stepdaughter was with them all of this time shopping too? Was she being ignored by OP?***\n\nSeeing her daughter being ignored or possibly rebuffed, Dad decided to spend time with her allowing her to share ideas instead of *possibly* ignored or run over.\n\n***OP dismissed the importance of that support from the daughter's side.***\n\n>*when his prekindergarten threw them a small early Christmas for the kids he chose to go to his daughters swimming competition instead (it was not anything important. most of the parents didn't attend however almost all the parents were there for the kids early Christmas)*\n\n***Excuse me but the kid is 2 years old, so who values the attendance?

A baby (or in your case toddler) tends to naturally need a mother\u2019s time.   To ensure the older child doesn\u2019t feel neglected, Dad tends to step up and spend more time with the older child.   As the younger child gets older, the time balances out more.

As a working mother, I can tell you that my working mother friends all agree that our kids need us more as teens preteens and teens than they do as babies and toddlers.

You are saying your husband should favour your adopted son over his biological daughter because he is the same race as the son... and thus would have more in common?\n\nI hope your husband finds this post. This doesn't even sound like this is about loving your son. It sound like you see your adopted son as a pawn to get your husband to choose you over his daughter. That won't happen. The only thing that you are doing is fracturing your marriage and putting these kids in a horrible position.", "You literally made it about race.", "And uh, jsyk, I didn't call my step-mum a parent because she was a nice one, but because I recognise that she was still in a position to *negatively affect my mental health* as bad as one, and that is the actual issue at hand here...", "My 4 year olds pre-k did send home a paper elf with a pic of my daughters face on it this year. It\u2019s about 10\u201d tall and the CUTEST FREAKING THING IVE EVER SEEN! They even laminated it for me! \n\nI\u2019m keeping it forever and it will be hung dead center every year. When I die it will be in my will that terms of inheritance are that it\u2019s hung every single year. I\u2019ve seriously never seen anything so freaking cute!! \n\nI\u2019m still glad they didn\u2019t make us come to a stupid party to get it.", "OP says \"hair color\" because she realizes saying \"skin color\" will make her sound even worse than she already does.", "\u2b06\ufe0f \u2b06\ufe0f \u2b06\ufe0f"]}
