He shouldn't have ever agreed to adopt with you, and he should never have married you once he knew you wanted a child.

What's more, you obviously didn't accept his daughter as part of the new family that you were making with him -- you would accept an adopted child, of neither of your genetics, but you wouldn't accept the daughter he already brought to your marriage as the child who could help you fulfill your wishes. \n\nWhy? Because she already had a mother? There's no child ever born who can't use more adults who love them and help take care of them, no matter how many they already have.

You're treating your -- yes, YOUR -- stepdaughter as if she were nothing to you, and you shouldn't. Your husband is treating the son he allowed you to adopt against his better judgment as if he were nothing to him, and he shouldn't. \n\nBut you're the one who forced this whole situation to take place to begin with, by responding to having conflicting wishes on a deal breaking subject as a reason to pressure your partner into obeying your wishes.

Two events, two parents, totally fine (best, actually) to divide that. The fact is that 2yo likely isn't that bothered about having both parents at the nursery affair but the daughter will really have appreciated the swim meet. Yes loads of parents go to that toddler stuff - it's extremely cute and heartwarming - but they are just enjoying the party, and he has mum there. Same with the bedrooms. Long term your son won't even remember what his room was like at this age, but his daughter (do you see her as your daughter too?) will remember her dad making that effort.\n\nBut the bigger picture is definitely extremely concerning. \n I am a firm believer in finding out whether someone does/doesn't want kids within the first 3 or so dates, and not pursuing a relationship with someone who is on the other side of the fence. It is one of those massive deal-breaker type issues that shouldn't be overlooked. Even when one person eventually says they're willing to consider changing, long-term resentment or resistance can follow. All too often you see couples with these massive incompatibilities deciding to make it work and then one or both being unhappy over that issue years later.
