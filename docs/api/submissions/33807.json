What a trashy, lazy, thankless family.\n\nYou were injured and post-surgical and catered Christmas dinner while they didn\u2019t help out in any way? Damn. In my extended family everyone always helps out brings dishes but they went overboard this year because they knew that even though we were hosting, having a kid who had recently had surgery (the day after you did) would make it difficult for us to prepare.\n\nIn hindsight, in self defense you should have had your fianc\u00e9 let them know in advance.

You pull a Superwoman by even hosting Christmas dinner and your relatives are complaining because a mere 7 days post-op, you weren't up to cooking an entire feast and then, cleaning up both before and after dinner. It is blatantly obvious that none of your rude and entitled relatives learned etiquette while growing up, nor the basics of gratitude for hospitality extended. \n\nMost people would have understandably cancelled dinner and requested some other family member take on the duties. You didn't! You graciously honored your commitment and were shamed for it. \n\n\"Bait and switch\"? Oh please, they came for a meal and they received a catered meal, not take-out. There is an enormous difference - they need to educate themselves. \n\nNext year you and your fianc\u00e9 should make reservations at a 4-star hotel serving Christmas dinner and skip the histrionics. \n\nNTA.

If I can't help with the immediate problem can I help with the peripheral stuff that might get neglected?\"\n\nAt the very least \"How can I make sure I'm not being a burden or adding stress for them?\"", "Free meal that likely cost more than if she\u2019d been able to cook it.
