You pull a Superwoman by even hosting Christmas dinner and your relatives are complaining because a mere 7 days post-op, you weren't up to cooking an entire feast and then, cleaning up both before and after dinner. It is blatantly obvious that none of your rude and entitled relatives learned etiquette while growing up, nor the basics of gratitude for hospitality extended. \n\nMost people would have understandably cancelled dinner and requested some other family member take on the duties. You didn't! You graciously honored your commitment and were shamed for it. \n\n\"Bait and switch\"? Oh please, they came for a meal and they received a catered meal, not take-out. There is an enormous difference - they need to educate themselves. \n\nNext year you and your fianc\u00e9 should make reservations at a 4-star hotel serving Christmas dinner and skip the histrionics. \n\nNTA.
