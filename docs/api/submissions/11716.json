It\u2019s a bottom floor flat in an older house so you can easily hear what other people are doing.\nMy upstairs neighbours, a couple (f and m, late 20s/early30s I think) are generally good neighbours, they\u2019re not loud or anything but I\u2019ve noticed their inappropriate and wasteful bathing habits. You can hear the water running easily, I\u2019m not a creep.\nThe girl takes a long bath (30 minutes to 1 hour) every single day. And the guy seems to be taking 2 shorter ones, one in the morning and one at night. I know all our flats have baths only, no showers.\n\nI thought it was just a one off but it happens every single day. Like I said they\u2019re not loud and don\u2019t bother me but I am worried about them being so very wasteful with water. It\u2019s not appropriate for 2 people to use this much water (I can hear her tipping up her bath with warm water constantly during her bath).\n\nI understand getting dirty and everything but these two work from home, they don\u2019t need daily baths, that\u2019s so wasteful.\n\nWhen I saw the girl (Jenny) I approached her and tried to gently ask about her bathing but she told me she wasn\u2019t going to discuss her habits with strangers. I tried to explain to her politely that it\u2019s wasteful and she should be more environmentally conscious and she rudely told me to mind my own business.\n\nI told her that I appreciate that they\u2019re recycling and have separate food waste but it\u2019s not enough and they\u2019re really wasteful and ruin the environment for everybody.\n\nShe told me that she\u2019ll take as many baths as she wants because she\u2019s not going to stink like I do.\n\nI told her that was rude and uncalled for and that i don\u2019t smell and natural skin oils are not smelly dirt. She told \u201ckeep telling yourself that, anyone can smell you.\u201d I tried to explain to her that she\u2019s unnecessarily rude and I was just trying to educate her on the damage they\u2019re doing but she even more rudely told me to mind my own fucking business and never speak to her again.\n\nI told my friends about this and some of them agree with me, others suggested I should\u2019ve spoken to the landlord so he could speak to them and a few people said I was the asshole and shouldn\u2019t approach strangers.\n\nI only tried to help but I worry that I might have crossed the line into being an asshole.

You are literally tracking how long your neighbors bath so you can approach them and confront them about it. You absolutely are acting creepy, if I had a neighbor do that I would complain to the landlord asap. You have no right to do what you did. You even somehow know which one of them baths the longest, that\u2019s really weird. It\u2019s normal to hear your neighbors, it\u2019s not normal to track their bathing habits. Best thing you can do is mind your business and never ever talk to that poor woman again.", "I work in environmental protection and people often think that would make me obsessive about things like wasting water or how much plastic waste a person makes. The reality is that it\u2019s a big lie to make people feel good about themselves for using a weird toilet or buying a reusable grocery bag.\n\nSomeone taking a bath every day is nothing, it changes nothing. The only way to actually change things at this point is on a grand scale - we\u2019re talking major laws for industry, entire countries completely changing, global initiative type stuff. If you\u2019re passionate about wastefulness and the global environmental crisis that we\u2019re in right now then you need to spend the time you\u2019re listening for people taking a bath on reading and educating yourself. Volunteer with a charity that\u2019s making big moves to create change in legislation. \n\nThings like trying to be more environmentally conscious in your personal life is great because it keeps it in in your head that there\u2019s something big and destructive happening and I encourage people to do whatever they need to to remind themselves that we\u2019re in the middle of something deadly. Going around pontificating and harassing people about taking a bath isn\u2019t the move here though. \n\nYTA - put the energy you\u2019re using judging people for not being as \u201cgood\u201d as you into something less performative.", "YTA- and honestly out of your damn mind. You need to mind your business. wtf.", "YTA. \n\nShe's right, you're butting in on something when you have no idea about their day to day lives and their need to bathe.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s none of your business how many baths/shower they take. Are you paying their bills? Are you their mother? If it\u2019s the environmental thing you have a problem with. Their amount of showers won\u2019t help the environment anyway. They already sorting and recycling. If you think about they are already offsetting. But yeah not your place to tell them.", "Jesus Christ. YTA. It's truly none of your business what they do. They aren't hurting you, it's their water bill. Besides, it's NORMAL to shower or bathe every day. Maybe you really do smell.", "YTA - you can't force neighbors to live by your standards. How would you feel if a neighbor tried to tell you that you need to bathe every day. Honestly it's borderline creepy.", "You didn't say why you think this is your business.  Can you explain?", "It's super creepy that you are commenting on people bathing habits haha.  YTA", "Sorry to let you know, but yta.  Are you often socially awkward?  This would be an example of when it's polite not to say anything.  \n\nIf you are living in a spaceship and water is very limited, I take it back.", "YTA.  You have no boundaries.  This can't be real.  Can it?", "YTA. You absolutely are. It really isn\u2019t your business. They aren\u2019t ruining the \u2018environment\u2019 by having baths. And you are super rude to approach a stranger and harass them about your views, then be offended when they weren\u2019t willing to have you \u2018educate\u2019 her. \nAlso, why are you checking their trash. \nYou ma\u2019am, are weird as balls.", "YTA. You're free to be as environmentally conscious as you want, but others have absolutely no obligation to follow suit. If they want to literally run the water 24/7 they can.\n\nAlso, if others are saying you smell, you probably do. Pointing that out about someone is a pretty big taboo, and one that most people wouldn't cross if it were not true.", "YTA and I\u2019m so confused \ud83e\udd23 do you pay their water bill? Do you even know them? No. Why, in your WILDEST dreams would you think it\u2019s appropriate to tell them how frequently they can bathe? This has to be fake. I just\u2026. Hahahah \ud83d\ude02", "YTA and unless you're sharing a water heater or paying their bill, it is none of your business how many baths they take (or whatever it is they might be doing with the water).\n\nTelling the woman she is \"ruining the environment for everyone\" when all she's doing is taking long baths is WAY over the top.  Who appointed you hall monitor?\n\nAlso, if there are only baths and no shower, you'd be hearing only the bath filling and draining.  Are you timing this stuff? That's incredibly creepy of you.", "YTA\n\nWho knew somebody so young could be promoted to chief of police bathing devision.\n\n\"It\u2019s not appropriate for 2 people to use this much water\"\n\nWhat is no appropriate is approaching a stranger and commenting on their bathing habits. They pay for their home and their water so can use as much of it as they like, whether you like it or not. You may not feel the need to bathe that much but your hygiene habits are not the gold standard.\n\nWhat would you even say to the landlord? They are not causing a disturbance or doing anything illegal so you have no basis to complain. If I were them I would report you to the landlord for being so invasive.\n\nEDIT: Life is hard enough as it is right now, if somebody wants to take a nice long bath, who are you to stop them.", "YTA, big time.  Other people's bathing habits are none of your business.  If you want to only bath occasionally, that's up to you, but other people get to bath as often as they find appropriate.  You are the only rude person here, and you need to butt out of other people's business.", "YTA With some people\u2019s jobs they need to clean up every day. Honestly how much they bathe and monitoring it is extremely creepy and disturbing. How often someone cleans themselves is not your business at all. Just leave this people alone as bathing everyday is not bad for your skin if you are using the right products. Would you do this to people in countries that shower daily? Why do you think telling them they are bathing to much will somehow change something? Learn what boundaries are and keep the things you have learned to yourself. What someone does with their body is not about you.", "YTA mind your own business. And stop your own creepy behaviors.", "YTA. Their water use is not your business, so your unwarranted criticism  would put anyone on the defensive.

You aren\u2019t paying their water bill", "YTA this couldn't possibly be any less of your business.

What\u2019s not appropriate here is you confronting someone about their bathing habits of all things when they don\u2019t affect you. That\u2019s weird and creepy.", "YTA\n\nMind ya business, stinky creeper", "YTA but this is hilarious. You confronted someone because they take a bath every day? What on earth is wrong with you?!", "YTA go live in a commune, you are wasting resources and electricity living alone", "Uhhh how is this even a question?\n\nYTA, all day long. It is none of your business.\n\nI don't even disagree with you on the water usage OP, it is wasteful and I'm trying to be a lot more conscious of my water usage myself, personally, but you crossed a line here, if I was the neighbour I'd be a little bit... worried/freaked out by how closely you seem to be tracking what I was doing. Creepy behaviour.", "YTA. This is absolutely creepy, and it's not your business at all. Also, how do you know if it's the girl or the guy that's bathing, that makes it seem even more creepy. Either way, you're being creepy and acting like a sanctimonious arsehole.", ">When I saw the girl (Jenny) I approached her and tried to impart my own personal opinion on her without any invite to do so, but she calmly told me she wasn\u2019t going to discuss her habits with strangers, which is an entirely reasonable response to the situation. I selfishly continued with my total lack of self awareness by trying to explain to her that I'm a busybody. Incredibly she showed excellent self-restraint when she told me to mind my own business.\n\nFixed that paragraph for you OP.  \n\n\nYTA", "I'm more creeped out by the fact that he seems to know that \"the girl\" takes a long bath and \"the guy\" takes 2 short ones.  How does he know who is taking any of the baths?  \n\nYTA, intrusive YTA.", "OP, it's time to get busy. You need to engage your behaviour in something other than monitoring your neighbours bathing habits. Time to go get political about the environment instead of meddling and being rude to your neighbours. YTA.", "YTA... mind your own business and stop trying to regulate other people's lives.

YTA", "YTA. I respect that you care for the environment but this is way too invasive. They are your neighbors- the only way it would be at least somewhat acceptable for you to be inquiring about someone\u2019s water usage is if you were paying for their water bill or if there was an issue where they were using all the hot water. \n\nSome people take baths to relax.

This is incredible rude and creepy of you.", "Yes, YTA. Seems like creepy one, too", "Lmao are you fr??? Yes YTA, a 30 min to 1hr bath is normal for a bath and hell yea I'm topping it off cause the water gets cold. Who are you to tell someone how many times to bathe?!

Mind your own fucking business and never talk to her again", "YTA You sound exhausting, they pay for the water they use.

Let people live their lives without unwanted intrusion.", "YTA, you are listening to people bathe regularly, that's creepy behavior. I'm surprised your neighbor didn't call the landlord to complain about you monitoring their behavior. Bathing once a day is perfectly normal and the only option they have is a bath. As for the guy, his job may mean he gets extremely dirty, so twice a day wouldn't be unusual either. If you're so concerned, purchase everyone in the building a shower head and stop monitoring other people's bathing behavior, it's creepy.", "YTA. A lot of people need to rinse off daily or even twice daily for various reasons and none of them are your business!

Of course she reacted in kind.", "YTA. Who put you in charge of monitoring other people\u2019s water usage? You\u2019re not paying for it, so why does it matter.", "Hahaha. Is this for real?! You are a huge AH and she's right, it is absolutely none of your business", "YTA. You simply cannot approach your neighbours, who are basically strangers, about how often they are bathing without coming off as a nosy creep and an AH. I don\u2019t like wasting water either, and it used to really bother me when my old neighbours would hose pine needles off their driveway, but it simply is not an acceptable thing to comment on.", "YTA mind your business", "YTA. As long as they're not loud or otherwise bothering you, you're both nosy and a creep.", "I'm convinced this has to be fake.", "YTA, this is incredibly intrusive. You do not have any business telling people what they can do in their own home. Please leave these poor people alone and stop harassing them.", "YTA - mind your own business", "This has to be fake. And you\u2019re definitely a weirdo. I probably would have reacted the same. People sometimes bathe daily and that\u2019s okay.

YTA", "YTA\n \nThose are normal bathing habits in the US.\nThe fact that you can hear it is something to discuss with the landlord.\n\nDon\u2019t comment on this or their recycling.\n\nYou may not be a creep but your behavior is certainly creepy.", "YTA. It is none of your business. You sound like a nosy creepy neighbour", "I have such a hard time believing this is real but if it somehow is, YTA", "Is this real?? YTA. I\u2019m honestly shocked you feel entitled to tell strangers how they should bathe. It\u2019s a little creepy to be fair and I\u2019d feel really uncomfortable if a neighbour approached me with this topic.", "YTA - you have no right to confront someone you barely know about their hygiene habits. \n\nRemember big corporations love to pass on environmental responsibility to the individual but they in fact are the problem. I work for a fairly small clothing company in the US (that most people have never heard of) and I promise you, the amount of plastic used shipping garments (every garment is individually wrapped, hundreds of thousands garments every couple of months. This also isn\u2019t unique to us, every clothing company does this I promise you) far outweighs ANYTHING you could ever do in your entire life combined to help the environment. \n\nPersonal responsibility for environmental damage is B.S. Don\u2019t go around telling people how they should behave, plus, if she said you stink you probably do. Just because you can\u2019t smell it and got used to it, doesn\u2019t mean other people can\u2019t smell you.", "YTA \n\nI understand your concern for the environnement but it's really not up to you to decide how many bath a person can take per day. I don't know where you live but where I'm from bathing everyday is what's expected. Twice can also be super normal if for exemple you exercise or go to the pool during the day. You should stop trying to control your neighbours habits and concentrate on yours.", "YTA \n\nIn Brazil we usually take more than a bath a day and we think ppl who do not bath daily to be very unhygienic\n\nAlso you're taking care of other people business, go check water consumption of larger companies on the agro or tech industries lol Go after billionaires jet traveling everyday or so", "Hi. I\u2019m a person who requires at least one bath daily (approximately an hour long) due to medical issues. You don\u2019t know their life and it\u2019s not your issue. I would hate to be your neighbor. YTA.", "YTA if you actually care, get the tenants to demand showers be installed, that will save way more water", "YTA it\u2019s not your place to police other people\u2019s bathrooms habits. If bathing is the only option then they are perfectly entitled to have one as often as they wish.", "1. Why has there been two AITA stories about baths this week??\n\n2. YTA dude and you\u2019re being very creepy. Also, approaching a person out of the blue to ask her about her bathing routines is so inappropriate, I don\u2019t blame her for never wanting to interact with you again.", "YTA you said yourself they\u2019re not bothering you at all so mind your business. You\u2019re a complete weirdo for doing this.", "YTA, mind your business. You know they work form home, but you don\u2019t know their work out or exercise habits. You don\u2019t know their sweat levels. People have different hygiene standards and would rather take two quick showers a day, but for some reason y\u2019all only have baths. \n\nBut it\u2019s not your business.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re rude, judgmental, and a creep.", "Maybe they are hand washing their clothes too.

Before you encroached on her territory and put your views on her, she was just a person out there in the world living her life.  You approached her.  You voiced your issues to her.  You wouldn't leave her alone.  You are the problem.  You weren't trying to help.  you were trying to force your views on a complete stranger who didn't ask nor want your opinion.", "You are a creep! Who the fck times how long someone is in the bath for! Also don't matter how long she baths for the same amount of water is used. Also keeping an eye on their trash habits tf. I hope they put a restraining order out against you thats just  creepy like to the max. Mind your own business. Get a hobby or something. Iv lived in flats that you can hear everything and I still never knew my neighbours routines coz I minded my own business n concentrated on my own life.

Literally.", "YTA, I have hEDS and some days I take 2/3 very long hot baths to deal with the pain.

You need to find a hobby and mind your business.", "YTA. you're not their mother, mind your own business.", "YTA, I am all for being more eco friendly and mindful of waste but going all in the way you did is not the answer.

As they said, it\u2019s none of your business", "YTA\n\n> tried to gently ask about her bathing\n\nIf you can't tell how insanely inappropriate it is for anyone other than a parent of a small child or an intimate life partner to question *anything* about someone's bathing ... a very intimate situation ... then I don't think reddit can help you. Try that crap at work/school and see how quick you get slapped with a sexual harassment complaint.\n\n> she rudely told me to mind my own business.\n\nNewsflash: Telling someone who is in your business to mind their own business is not rude. Asking someone about their intimate habits is rude. Getting huffy when you're called out for crossing boundaries is rude. Calling someone rude for asserting boundaries is rude. You are rude. Your neighbor was not rude.\n\n>she\u2019s not going to stink like I do.\n\n>I told her that was rude and uncalled for \n\nSo... you think you're within your rights to comment on your bathing habits over a perceived affront to the environment... but she isn't within her rights to comment on your bathing habits over a perceived affront to her own senses? Get over yourself. \n\n> I tried to explain to her that she\u2019s unnecessarily rude \n\nNo, you are. She'd asserted a boundary about discussing her intimate habits and you continued to repeatedly violate that boundary. \n\n>trying to educate her on the damage they\u2019re doing\n\nYou're neither her parent nor her instructor. It's not your place. Even if you have some misguided \"it's everyone's place\" mentality, there are ways to neutrally discuss water waste without bringing up someone's personal habits. How very uncouth.\n\n>he even more rudely told me to mind my own fucking business and never speak to her again.\n\nMind your own fucking business and never speak to her again.\n\n>others suggested I should\u2019ve spoken to the landlord \n\nLol, do that. Landlord doesn't have any more right than you do to restrict her bathing, and likely will not care anyway. Hopefully she will also go to the landlord about the harassment from another tenant who is interfering with her right to peaceable enjoyment of her home.\n\n> a few people said I was the asshole and shouldn\u2019t approach strangers.\n\nThey are correct", "Didn't even finish. \n\nYTA. \n\nIt isn't your problem if they are \"wasting\" water.

Mind your own beeswax.", "I think you could liken this to you seeing your neighbours eating loads of meat and you feeling like you need to personally educate that one person/couple to become vegan or something- use your energy elsewhere, if you\u2019re passionate about waste and recycling and the environment then use that to educate people in the right way, get involved in a group or something. \nLeave ya neighbour alone, there are plenty of people wasting out there, don\u2019t pick on them. It looks quite creepy you listening to their habits so that\u2019s probably why she was so defensive. YTA", "YTA- are you EVER out of line. Why TF are you so invested in how many baths your neighbours are or aren't taking? You know what's rude and uncalled for? You, chasing your neighbour down to scold them about baths. And you ARE a creep for this.", "YTA - it\u2019s not your business.  They\u2019re not being disruptive or doing anything illegal.  It\u2019s not your business.

Mind your own business!", "YTA\n\nBut I think this may be fake.\n\n\nThe rental only has baths and no showers?

That's creepy as hell, and really controlling. It'sabsolutely none of your business. If you were flatmates sharing utilities that would be one thing, but you're NEIGHBORS. I am just trying to imagine if my next door neighbor in the house 10 feet next to mine came over and confronted me about that as I was leaving. I'd probably give them the hose and laugh about \"wasting water\".", "YTA. In the grand scheme of things, your neighbours bathes have absolutely no effect on the water crises- and you would definitely have seemed like a self-righteous prig. If you were sharing a water bill you may have had grounds but yeah, this way makes you seem stalkery", "YTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t even questionable.  If my neighbor came to me and tried to dictate the amount/length of my showers I would laugh myself to tears.\n\nYou have absolutely no rights when it comes to dictating how others live.  You would be even **worse** if you went to the landlord.  Not to mention, where does this end?  Let\u2019s say you did manage to change their habits, whose next?\n\nBottom line is, **stay out of it**.  Learn to ignore it or go talk to someone about your need to control strangers who just happen to be your neighbors.", "YTA.
