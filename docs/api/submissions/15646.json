{"id": 15646, "submission_id": "12yhizj", "title": "AITA for refusing to stop hitting a table tennis ball hard while on holiday after parents complained it was \"scaring their children\"?", "selftext": "So this happened while me and my twin brother were on holiday in an all inclusive hotel last year. We are both 23. We are both semi-professional table tennis players. Not good enough to make it a full time career but we do compete in national competitions. We purposefully picked a hotel which had a table tennis table so we could continue practicing to keep sharp while we was there (standards drop rapidly if you aren't constantly practising). So obviously we hit the ball fast and hard like professionals are supposed to. Suddenly then a middle aged man approaches us and tells us we need to stop hitting the ball so hard as it is scaring his kids and lectures us about how this is a place for calm leisure and we are ruining that. We explain to him we are semi-pros and need to keep playing but he didn't care. His wife then came up and was a lot more gentle explaining how it's making their kids uncomfortable. I suggest they move to different sunlounges so they are away from it. They both take offence to this and the dad goes and get's a member of staff who says this is a family friendly environment and this isn't the place for hard play. We tell him we have absolutely not intention of stopping, that a table tennis ball is weightless and harmless and that there is no rule on anywhere that says we can't play like that. That member of staff then goes and brings a manager who agrees with me straight away and as I did suggests the family move to a different spot if they feel uncomfortable as there are plenty of free spaces. They reluctantly move saying they \"hope we are happy with ourselves\" and I hear the dad say under his breath \"f\\*\\*\\*ing ass\\*oles\". Even afterwards another person who watched whole thing came up to have a go at us saying we were completely unreasonable. AITA?\n\nRight I think I need to make clear because most people don't seem to know the difference. I am talking about table tennis not ping pong. Ping Pong balls are harder and could potentially hurt a little.

Or maybe they all suck but are having way too much fun laughing at each other. The dad can move. Policing other vacationers so they can\u2019t enjoy themselves using the offered resort amenities is AH behavior. They all paid to be there. They made choices based off the amenities. They are playing to their level. Nothing wrong with that. \n\nI would never pick a spot near an air hockey machine if I wanted to relax. Common sense.

I guess it's annoying that the hotel heavily advertises the sports and only to then preach about how you can only play it in a certain way. I believe there should be some sort of warning telling you can't play that way if it's only meant for amateur play.
