{"id": 15646, "submission_id": "12yhizj", "title": "AITA for refusing to stop hitting a table tennis ball hard while on holiday after parents complained it was \"scaring their children\"?", "selftext": "So this happened while me and my twin brother were on holiday in an all inclusive hotel last year. We are both 23. We are both semi-professional table tennis players. Not good enough to make it a full time career but we do compete in national competitions. We purposefully picked a hotel which had a table tennis table so we could continue practicing to keep sharp while we was there (standards drop rapidly if you aren't constantly practising). So obviously we hit the ball fast and hard like professionals are supposed to. Suddenly then a middle aged man approaches us and tells us we need to stop hitting the ball so hard as it is scaring his kids and lectures us about how this is a place for calm leisure and we are ruining that. We explain to him we are semi-pros and need to keep playing but he didn't care. His wife then came up and was a lot more gentle explaining how it's making their kids uncomfortable. I suggest they move to different sunlounges so they are away from it. They both take offence to this and the dad goes and get's a member of staff who says this is a family friendly environment and this isn't the place for hard play. We tell him we have absolutely not intention of stopping, that a table tennis ball is weightless and harmless and that there is no rule on anywhere that says we can't play like that. That member of staff then goes and brings a manager who agrees with me straight away and as I did suggests the family move to a different spot if they feel uncomfortable as there are plenty of free spaces. They reluctantly move saying they \"hope we are happy with ourselves\" and I hear the dad say under his breath \"f\\*\\*\\*ing ass\\*oles\". Even afterwards another person who watched whole thing came up to have a go at us saying we were completely unreasonable. AITA?\n\nRight I think I need to make clear because most people don't seem to know the difference. I am talking about table tennis not ping pong. Ping Pong balls are harder and could potentially hurt a little.

A resort pool is not a designated lap pool with lanes. Table tennis is for table tennis. If a bunch of semi pros were playing volleyball in the designated volleyball spot is that unacceptable because they may be noisier grunting, and hitting the ball harder? Or maybe they all suck but are having way too much fun laughing at each other. The dad can move. Policing other vacationers so they can\u2019t enjoy themselves using the offered resort amenities is AH behavior. They all paid to be there. They made choices based off the amenities. They are playing to their level. Nothing wrong with that. \n\nI would never pick a spot near an air hockey machine if I wanted to relax. Common sense.

I guess it's annoying that the hotel heavily advertises the sports and only to then preach about how you can only play it in a certain way. I believe there should be some sort of warning telling you can't play that way if it's only meant for amateur play.

Stop making excuses.", "Definitely agree, if they were getting in a quick 30 minute round and then moving on, or even an hour+ if they're using it during a time of day when the lounge is mostly vacant like early morning and heading out once the space was becoming more crowded that would have been fine. \n\nEven if they'd been playing normally hogging the table for 2 hours would still be inconsiderate, though I doubt anyone would have said anything beyond maybe trying to get a sense of when they'd be done so they could hop on.", "Yes", "Maybe ESPN Ocho can make a comeback for this championship. I think we actually need Ben Stiller.", "It\u2019s called Forrest Gump", "They already did something like this, Balls of Fury, I believe.", "The claim I'd take issue with is the idea that the sun lounge at a resort, with lounge chairs only a few feet away from the table, is a \"place to play\" for professional-level table tennis players who are hitting the ball much harder and require much more space to play than amateurs.\n\nWould it be okay for a water polo team to practice in a resort pool by throwing the ball around at 40+ MPH while families are playing nearby?", "Because they are using the table in an unsafe loud way. If they were playing a normal game then the parents or staff would not have been upset.", "The hotel chose to put it there because they expected people to bop a ball back and forth between sips of pina colada, not strap on the sweat bands and go full 80s rock training montage in the middle of the resort.", "Totally agree, but that's also completely unrelated to how long they were there.", "No, but it would make sense. Is there another spot that's not near a loud resource?", "Haha, I'm now picturing this like the volleyball scene from Top Gun!", "Hahaha of course it was.", "\u201cI should be allowed to be loud and disruptive because kids are sometimes loud and disruptive\u201d isn\u2019t making the argument you think you\u2019re making.", "If the children are being rowdy and disruptive, and the parents can\u2019t get them under control, they should absolutely leave.", "And little kids have a totally different threshold of things they consider painful, too. Think about pulling off a bandaid, we think little of it, but it's totally normal for little kids to fuss or even cry about it hurting because they(hopefully) have a lot less experience coping with painful stimuli.", "I mean this is table tennis. There's only so hard they can hit. It's lilke a 2 gram air filled plastic ball. No one is getting hurt here. \n\nAlso, if the pool had a setup for water polo and there were other pools and other places, then I think it would be okay.", "\u201cPlaying with the boys \u2026.\ud83c\udfb6\u201d", "No. My argument is I should be able to use an advertised amenity to it's intended purpose. If not then I will request a full refund based on false advertising.", "Yeah, as a little kid, any injury could *literally* be the worst pain you've ever felt in your life.", "Fr fr.", "The phrasing \"he wanted them to move their chairs\" can also encompass moving to a different chair as opposed to physically hauling the chair around.", "That wasn\u2019t its intended purpose, though.  If you asked an employee whether the purpose of that table in that area was to serve as a practice area for two semi-pro players playing disruptively for hours on end, the answer would be no.", "I don\u2019t think family resorts advertise that they have areas \u201csemi-pros\u201d can use for their training for 2 hours per day.", "Sure, but \"move to different sunlounges\" means to move to a different one...", "I have this mental image of someone setting up their umbrella on a beach volleyball court that is not in use, then getting offended when later asked to move off the court so people can play. \n\n\u201cWho do you think you are? Can\u2019t you see that I was here first?\u201d", "So the purpose of the table tennis tables is not table tennis. Interesting theory you have there. I guess the resort manager did not agree."]}
