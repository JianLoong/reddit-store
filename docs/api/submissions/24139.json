To give you some context, my sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. We used to be close growing up, but as we got older, we started to drift apart due to our differing personalities and lifestyles.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 (30M) and I have been together for seven years, and he's honestly the love of my life. We got engaged six months ago, and the wedding planning has been in full swing. Now, the issue arose during a family dinner a few weeks ago. My fianc\u00e9 was there, and he was telling a story about a recent hiking trip he took. He's really into outdoor activities, and he was excitedly talking about climbing a challenging trail.\n\nOut of nowhere, my sister made a snide comment, saying, \"It's surprising you actually did something that requires physical effort.\" She said that and looked directly into my eyes. Ever since, I started dating him, she made fun of me, for being with a more chubby man. Everyone at the table went silent, and I could see the hurt on my fianc\u00e9's face. He brushed it off, but I could tell he was hurt by her comment.\n\nAfter the dinner, I confronted my sister privately about her hurtful remark. She dismissed it, saying it was just a joke and that my fianc\u00e9 shouldn't be so sensitive. This really upset me, as her comment felt like a direct attack on the person I love. I explained to her how important my fianc\u00e9 is to me and how her words were hurtful.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, I sent out wedding invitations to all our close family and friends. When my sister received her invitation, she texted me, asking if she could bring her new boyfriend of two months as her plus-one. I thought about it and decided that, given the strained relationship between us, I would prefer to keep the wedding a more intimate affair with people who genuinely support our relationship.\n\nI told my sister that we were having a small wedding and couldn't accommodate plus-ones for people we didn't know well. She didn't take it well. She accused me of bad things, like not being happy for her, not wanting her to enjoy the day as much as I will. After a while, I was full of her and told her she\u2019s not invited anymore. I brought up the hurtful comment she made about my fianc\u00e9 and how that played a role in my decision and that she doesn\u2019t respect my boundaries. She got defensive and said I was overreacting.\n\nNow she's been telling other family members that I'm being unreasonable and that I'm using her comment as an excuse to keep her out of the wedding. Some family members have reached out to me, saying I should be the bigger person and invite her, regardless of the past drama.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding after she insulted my fianc\u00e9, or should I put the past aside and include her for the sake of family harmony?", "created_utc": 1691451062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l0uuu/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sister_to_my_wedding/", "score": 328, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not one comment, it is the blatant disrespect after years of making fun of your relationship with a \"chubby man\". Your sister does not deserve a place in you and your fianc\u00e9's wedding. It is not being \"the bigger person\" by accepting someone ridiculing your partner, whom you love, and making them feel judged by your entire family. Think about it, by allowing her to get away with this you are telling him directly that his feelings do not matter and to accept not being a \"real\" part of your family.

These sorts of events can reconstitute and transform family relationships beyond the one that is being celebrated.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister did not show interest to be a nice part of your and mostly your fiance's life. Because she may not have fully realized what effects her words had, you may want to consider to lay out exactly how HER behaviour led to HER being uninvited.

Apparently she thought i told her that she should break up with him immediately so i was the only one with a partner \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 she then proceeded to call my partner a redneck hick and call me a slut etc. So i stopped talking to her. When i started planning my wedding, I decided i woulsnt invite her because i hadnt talked to her for over 3 years, and my mum tried to guilt me into inviting her . I refused, it was my fiances and my day, and we were only inviting who we WANTED  there, you dont get an invite simply because you are family! We had an amazing wedding day, with exactly who we wanted there.\n\nYears later my sisters long distance boyfriend dumped her, after years of her running after him, spending HER money on hotel rooms and airfares (her boyfriend was a SURGEON and she still had to pay for everything!), and she ended up dating the guy I told her she should go for 13 years ago!
