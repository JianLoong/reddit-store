To give you some context, my sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. We used to be close growing up, but as we got older, we started to drift apart due to our differing personalities and lifestyles.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 (30M) and I have been together for seven years, and he's honestly the love of my life. We got engaged six months ago, and the wedding planning has been in full swing. Now, the issue arose during a family dinner a few weeks ago. My fianc\u00e9 was there, and he was telling a story about a recent hiking trip he took. He's really into outdoor activities, and he was excitedly talking about climbing a challenging trail.\n\nOut of nowhere, my sister made a snide comment, saying, \"It's surprising you actually did something that requires physical effort.\" She said that and looked directly into my eyes. Ever since, I started dating him, she made fun of me, for being with a more chubby man. Everyone at the table went silent, and I could see the hurt on my fianc\u00e9's face. He brushed it off, but I could tell he was hurt by her comment.\n\nAfter the dinner, I confronted my sister privately about her hurtful remark. She dismissed it, saying it was just a joke and that my fianc\u00e9 shouldn't be so sensitive. This really upset me, as her comment felt like a direct attack on the person I love. I explained to her how important my fianc\u00e9 is to me and how her words were hurtful.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, I sent out wedding invitations to all our close family and friends. When my sister received her invitation, she texted me, asking if she could bring her new boyfriend of two months as her plus-one. I thought about it and decided that, given the strained relationship between us, I would prefer to keep the wedding a more intimate affair with people who genuinely support our relationship.\n\nI told my sister that we were having a small wedding and couldn't accommodate plus-ones for people we didn't know well. She didn't take it well. She accused me of bad things, like not being happy for her, not wanting her to enjoy the day as much as I will. After a while, I was full of her and told her she\u2019s not invited anymore. I brought up the hurtful comment she made about my fianc\u00e9 and how that played a role in my decision and that she doesn\u2019t respect my boundaries. She got defensive and said I was overreacting.\n\nNow she's been telling other family members that I'm being unreasonable and that I'm using her comment as an excuse to keep her out of the wedding. Some family members have reached out to me, saying I should be the bigger person and invite her, regardless of the past drama.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding after she insulted my fianc\u00e9, or should I put the past aside and include her for the sake of family harmony?", "created_utc": 1691451062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l0uuu/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sister_to_my_wedding/", "score": 686, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not one comment, it is the blatant disrespect after years of making fun of your relationship with a \"chubby man\". Your sister does not deserve a place in you and your fianc\u00e9's wedding. It is not being \"the bigger person\" by accepting someone ridiculing your partner, whom you love, and making them feel judged by your entire family. Think about it, by allowing her to get away with this you are telling him directly that his feelings do not matter and to accept not being a \"real\" part of your family.

Saying as you've brought it up and she still is telling you you're overreacting is her way of pawning the blame off to you.\n\nAnd FYI, when people tell you to be the bigger person....generally they want you to shut up and not cause fights, to keep their reputation. Your relatives are being manipulative.\n\nCongratulations on getting engaged and good luck for the wedding!", "What I am wondering is why didn't you stand up for your fianc\u00e9' at the family dinner? Can you imagine if it happened to you, and he didn't stand up for you?", "NTA\n\n\nYour sister has no place in your guest list tbh. You have all the rights to a wedding with people who actually support you and your fianc\u00e9. As a (more than) chubby person, this comment would've hurt me a lot too. :/\n\nAll the best for the wedding planning!", "NTA\n\nWhat I would, and do say to my kids, think about a year or 10 years from now are you going to regret having/ not having her there. \n\nMy in-laws weren't at my wedding, there is nothing for me to regret it was their choice, but I still haven't forgiven them 27 years later because they hurt hubby. \n\nTake away the anger, have an all out shouting match if you have to, but think about who is going to be hurt most and why, then you will have your answer.", "NTA. It's your wedding. Do whatever you want to do, have whoever you want to have. You're the one paying for it. You're the one getting married. If others don't like it, fine. Then they're welcome to not attend.", "NTA. \n\nSpeaking from experience, she would have tried to make your wedding day hell. Good on you for holding your ground.", "NTA. I think I'd elope.", "NTA - you wouldn't be able to \"use\" her comment as an excuse to keep her out of the wedding if she didn't make those shitty comments.\n\nActions have consequences, who knew!", "NTA. The family members who are telling you that you are, though? *They* sure are.", "This. I always hated it, when people told me to \"be the bigger person\". Why should I? Why should I swallow my pride and diginity for someone who is clearly in the wrong? Just so everyone can pretend that everything is fine, although it is actually not? No, thank you.\n\nOP, you are NTA and don't let anyone shame you into giving in. Your sister is mad, that she got served, what she ordered.", "Truth. The people at your wedding should be those who are happy for you and who support your relationship. It would appear that OP's sister doesn't qualify on either point. So, OP is correct to exclude her.", "Her sister did not tease her but her fianc\u00e9 who was hurt by the comment. My sibling will apologise to me if his teasing/joke hurt me. The sister did not apologise. Teasing is only nice/playful if the person being teased doesn\u2019t mind or is equally involved.", "Going to a wedding of your sibling alone where your entire family would be in attendance is shitty? If it\u2019s a friend\u2019s wedding, I agree because others are strangers but you aren\u2019t alone in a family event.\n\nAnd allowing a plus one depends on the budget and space available. If a venue seats 100 people and the bride and groom have 100 close guests and friends then they will get priority instead of a plus one who is a stranger to them. They won\u2019t not invite a few relatives and friends to give others plus one.", "I fear that she\u2019ll do something on the wedding day to make it about her as she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle OP getting all the attention.", "Happy cake day", "Yup, my thoughts exactly. If the OP sister had any real class she would want her sister to have a Wonderful wedding day and be happy that she has a wonderful fiancee she loves.", "Yeah there is that as well....she sure didn't think about what she said until it was said. I sure hope that all family members agree to a solution that will keep everyone happy. Not an easy choices, I guess the saying \"You can chose your friends, but you cant chose your family\" applies here!", "Why are you noting age? I suspect OP\u2019s sister is jealous, just as an observation. What OP does is up to her and her SO, my only advice was to figure out OP and SO\u2019s long term goals with OP\u2019s sister.", "You can be jealous at any age. Some people do not grow out of it, and some will use cutting remarks to steal the joy from the other person because they can. Not all siblings have a great relationship and these two are indicative of this.", "Sometimes the one who owe an apology don't understand they owe it. An honest conversation can help. It's also how OP would be the bigger person in a reasonable way.", "no, just no.", "Personally, she\u2019s your sister and you don\u2019t get many of those, also who wants to go to a wedding alone\u2026.but who gets the golden plus one ticket?? Well at least it\u2019s not a second cousin asking for it(happened to me) life\u2019s too short, give her the plus one and go out to dinner with her and smooth it out before the wedding. Put a small amount of attention on her to keep her happy which will hopefully render you getting the most attention on your day", "Conceivably you're stuck with these people for the rest of your life. Because that's why we enter marriage to have somebody for the rest of our life right? It sounds like there's a good bit of sibling rivalry there between your husband and his sister probably not all that healthy. Including her in his wedding will bond you to the others of her family members because they know how wretched she acts. And remember enjoy your day.", "Yep, you the AH.  While your sister's comment was mean and rude, that's no reason to punish her by saying she can't bring a date no matter how long they've been dating.\n\nWeddings aren't \"your special day\", they are a shared event with family and friends.  If you didn't budget for your sister to have a plus one, you planned above your means.  Don't start what should be a celebration of love with mean spirited pettiness.", ">Some family members have reached out to me, saying I should be the bigger person and invite her, regardless of the past drama.\n\nNTA. She was the one who started the drama. And by your explanation, it's pretty obvious that she's been jealous of your happy relationship, and sad that she doesn't have a guy as caring and loving as you do. She's your sister, and family should come above all. But when your family betrays you, it calls for raising your voice. Which you did.\nAlthough if you still feel that you should give your sister another chance, and that you cannot seem to bring yourself to celebrate an occasion like your wedding without her, then probably give her another chance. Make it clear that you're not talking out of emotions, and that this is completely a logical conversation you want to have. Don't let her say that you're overreacting- make it clear from the start. Explain to her where you're coming from and try to talk to her calmly and make her understand how her hurtful statements and her behaviour from the past on various occasions have grown a wall between the two of you. Try to make her understand that she means a lot to you and that you wouldn't want to lose her.\nI really hope this helps, and that your sister understands your position and confronts that she was in the wrong. And I hope that you two get along like happy sisters!\nCongratulations on the wedding too!", "NTA - this whole \u2018being the bigger person\u2019 is the biggest load of BS in history!!!\n\nAnyone who says that, is just an enabler! \n\nYour sister needs to learn, her actions have consequences!", "NTA but I would invite her. She\u2019s my sister no matter what. Her and her +1 will be at a separate table from you and hubby anyway. It\u2019s not there has to be a lot of interaction with her on that day\u2026. Especially if she isn\u2019t a brides maid. Have your other brides maids block her from you throughout and you\u2019ll be fine.", "NTA honestly she sounds like a jealous b", "Info\n\nYour sister is definitely an a-hole for the comments about your fianc\u00e9\u2019s body. If such comments are a pattern of behavior, I would have not invited her at all.\n\nAs for the wedding invitation, if it was explicitly to sister and not \u201csister and guest\u201d then n-t-a. If the invite included a guest, y-w-b-t-a. Sister is old enough to understand only people invited to the wedding should attend, but if her invitation included a plus-1 you don\u2019t get to dictate who her plus-one is.", "NTA.  And those saying \"oh be the bigger person\" can eff off.  I get so tired of this be the bigger person guff.  To me that just means \"oh roll over and play dead to keep the peace\".", "NTA. If anyone, family or not, went out of their way to make my partner feel badly about trying to improve themselves, that would be the end of that relationship. That kind of behaviour is reprehensible and shows they are nothing more than a bully and an asshole. \n\nYour sister appears to have unresolved mental health issues when it comes towards you. Good for you for standing your ground. Don\u2019t let anyone dictate to you who you want at your big day. Good luck.", "NTA. Your sister is being a selfish \u2014 and frankly rude \u2014 child. Good for you for sticking up for your fianc\u00e9 *and* for putting your sister in her place.", "NTA\n\nSome jokes just aren't funny.", "NTA. \n\nShe must apologize to your fiance and you as well. Then, maybe, you can think about re-inviting her.", "NTA\n\nLove the \u201cshe says I don\u2019t want her to enjoy the day as much as I will\u201d line. Why do you want to have a better time than the bride on her wedding day?", "\"it was just a joke\" It is not even funny...", "NTA. I notice in all of this she never actually apologized or took responsibility for anything. Sadly I'm sure disinviting her will completely destroy your relationship, but there's not much there to save anyway.", "NTA. Your sister needs to learn consequences.", "NTA. It's your wedding. You invite who you want. That's it.", "NTA", "Hell nah, it\u2019s time to stop being \u201cthe bigger person\u201d", "\u201cUsing it as an excuse to keep her out of the wedding.\u201d  See, that\u2019s the fun part, you don\u2019t need an excuse. It\u2019s your wedding and your sister is a jerk. Simple as that.", "Absolutely not the Ahole.  Why oh why to people excuse bad behavior.  No you don't have to be the bigger person.  Its your DAY.  She is shifting blame cause she knows she said something hurtful and it really was.  Go have your day and happy happy years to you and your love.", "No, you're not.\n\nThese days people think that it's the \"IDGAF\" way to say, do hurtful things and expect no one to take offense, expect everyone to just move along like nothing was said and done...they expect no consequence...\n\nIn large part this is because people are so suppressed that the sensation of bad isn't noticed in their bodies, they don't become aware of the bad feeling in them, the sign the body gives so you can know what you're doing is bad (and so they complain about being so \"numb\" and doing things \"just to feel alive\")...they don't feel the good feeling, either, so they don't correct course (we all use these sensations to alter our behavior)...\n\nSo then they conjure up these expectations based on their warped feedback from life since they don't know good/bad...\n\nSo when you confront people like this they seem offended and they blame you.\n\nDon't invite her to the wedding.\nOr the baby shower. \nAnything...\nUntil you get a sincere apology.", "NTA. If your other family members take her side over yours and want you to make accommodations to YOUR wedding so THEY can have a good time - they don\u2019t need to be there either. The wedding is for you and your fianc\u00e9 alone and you two are the only ones who need to be happy. Anyone who feels otherwise genuinely doesn\u2019t need to be there. Saying he\u2019s \u201csensitive\u201d and you\u2019re \u201coverreacting\u201d are manipulation buzz words. You\u2019re fine - if she\u2019s gonna act like a child let her pout.", "NTA. Don't let people bait you using that \"be the bigger person\" nonsense. Your sister was out of line and she used classic bully tactics(\"It was just a joke, don't be so sensitive\").

She is mean and evil.", "Your family is only thinking about you and your sister and not you fianc\u00e9, who is also celebrating their wedding that day.

She\u2019s obviously not sorry, and she can go do that alone that day.", "NTA You play stupid games you win stupid prizes.", "NTA.  This wasn't a one-off comment from her.  This was a part of a pattern of behavior she's shown since you *started dating* your now fianc\u00e9.  Tell her and the family members that are on her side that you invited her to give her a chance to prove that she's not going to continue her past behavior.  She blew it when she refused to take your \"No\" to a plus one for an answer and tried to make your wedding day about her having fun at a party.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t allow somebody who insulted my partner to my wedding.", "NTA", "NTA - Don't let shitty people be around you.

I have a similar relationship with my parents (I'm NC with my brother), and they'll make hurtful remarks and brush my hurt off as me being sensitive and it's just a joke.

Do you want that energy there on your special day? And you should enjoy your day more than your sister - it's YOUR day, not hers!\n\nProtect yourself and your fianc\u00e9 and do what's right for you.

If nothing else, it may get your family off of your back.  Weddings are already stressful enough, and maybe she'll make a fool of herself at the wedding, and people can see what kind of person she really is.  That's certainly what happened with my SIL.  She actually yelled at my wife because someone else took charge of helping us at the end of the reception.  It was a fun story at the after-party.  She also called us for help because she was locked out of her parents' house.  I told her, \"This is our wedding night.  You're 41.  Figure it out.\"  That was also amusing to us and the people at the after-party", "And as a consequences all the flying monkeys need to be disinvited too.", "25 is not even too old. That's barely the point that people start to mature these days. All I know is 80% of people in their early to mid twenties do not have their shit fully together. (Source me late twenties)\n\nSounds like op's sister is still stuck in that high school clique mentality to me, especially if she only started dating someone and immediately wants to bring them to a family wedding, then kick up a fuss. That just tells me she's not got her shit together.", "The issue is you can be jelous but control your mouth and you dont have to be rude.  Grown ups pretend to be civil all the time.
