You definitely need to have a chat with him about household maintenance expectations. Don\u2019t let him weaponize his incompetence as the kids say these days.", "This is crazy. Call me an old-fashioned fuddy-duddy but my understanding was that the cook, unless they want to handle it themselves, does not do the cleaning, particularly if you alone made an entire thanksgiving spread. How the fianc\u00e9 didn't see that, especially with your back pain keeping you from doing so and even from enjoying your meal, is mind-numbing and even alarming", "Since it's 'your house' you should tell him to pack his things and go.\n\nHe isn't cleaning because it's your house (big red flag).

You cooked, he should have been all over those dishes.   What exactly does he think this is?  The 50s?", "Nta \n\nHE should take pride in the cleanliness and do it himself.", "NTA. You aren't a maid, there's no reason he can't help you at all.", "NTA- Is her a tenant in your house? He should ALSO be responsible for keeping it clean. Especially since it basically sat unchanged since Thursday.", "NTA - but take this to heart. Your fianc\u00e9 clearly expects you to cook and clean (even suggesting you keep the house this level of clean always?!) is this what you want in a partner?", "NTA he\u2019s lazy. He seems to see you more as a cleaner/cooker then an actual partner or spouse", "Wow guest didn\u2019t help you clean up? Where I\u2019m from the guest always help with clean up since the host had to get everything ready and if we know someone has back issues or something else going on we help make things as well and still clean up.", "NTA\n\nsounds like your partner is a lazy one though!  Happy to enjoy a meal that you spent all day preparing but doesn't want to pull his weight and clean the kitchen as his contribution!", "NTA- you guys are a partnership! It\u2019s your partners home just as much as yours. You guys delegate the tasks and you completed yours. This is one of those  tough positions because of his attitude. Clearly he some thoughts about the roles you guys each have. It could go down a path you might not be willing to take.  This leads to a much bigger conversation that you guys need to have before you are married! \n\nNot sure if you already answered this in the comments. But the only thing that might slightly change the situation is if there was something that happened during those two days since thanksgiving. Was there something that big picture affected your family and he took care of while you were sick? It still doesn\u2019t change the fact he didn\u2019t complete his tasks. But it could explain the reason why it wasn\u2019t done. But if that\u2019s the case he needs to explain and guys as partners can decide to complete the remaining tasks together. \n\nWhat cannot be excused is his comment about how you should \u201cbe responsible for my house\u201d  Even if you are a stay at home mom and you guys have mutually decided your responsibility is home keeping (not saying is it) - you completed a much larger task than outside your normal that he ultimately benefitted from. He should help bring the house back to order! \n\nYou need to sit down with him and explore his comments and see what kind of ideology is behind it. It might a careless comment and maybe when you talk to him - it\u2019s something you guys identify to be corrected or maybe he did not communicated his feelings correctly nor understood the implications of the comment. However, this could be his way of thinking and  it\u2019s something he just hasn\u2019t fully expressed yet and it\u2019s best for it to come to light so you can make a decision if this changes the relationship for you! \n\nI wish you the best of luck with this!", "NTA But rethink this relationship\n\nYour fiance sounds, at best, gross and sexist.", "NTA. You were just really sick of pain since they did not help enough. They should not let you help even if you wanted.", "NTA when he said he was proud of you for keeping house then you should have told him that you will be proud of him once he has finished cleaning. Wtf is he trying to pull. Good for you for seeing through his bullshit.", "NTA for that, but you might be if you go through with marrying this guy.\n\nThink about it long and hard. If you marry him, this is your life.", "NTA. What exactly was your daughter doing? 16 is old enough to be able to rinse dishes, load them in a dishwasher and run it, as well as handwash any items that are not dishwasher safe. \n\nHe could have helped you out and assisted your daughter in doing dishes if needed. He chose not to do the dishes either.\n Both she and he knew about your back problems.", "NTA\n\nDoesn\u2019t he have pride in the cleanliness of his house?", "NTA\n\nSo it's conveniently \"your house\" when cleaning up after thanksgiving is involved, but it's no doubt \"his house\" when he invited his family for thaksgiving, right?", "NTA. It is his house too, so he should also take pride in cleaning it.", "NTA. He thinks cleaning and cooking are YOUR jobs.", "Your fianc\u00e9 thinks he is clever, turning the argument around on you repeatedly.\n\nHe could see you were in pain for two days because of fatigue and still didn\u2019t bother to clean up. Not just that, trying to argue that it is your responsibility to clean all the time is a huge red flag. \n\nPlease dump this guy and boot him out of your place. NTA", "NTA. Tell your fiance that either he can take some responsibility for his house, or he can move out so he doesn't live in your house anymore.", "INFO, do you have a job?", "You both are the assholes. There is a standoff and neither of you will back down. There will be no resolution.", "YTA for still refusing to help even after he asked for help.\n\nNothing can change the fact that it didn't get done Friday or Saturday. But now that sunday has come around and he has asked for your help, I can't imagine my husband asking me to help clean and me saying no just for the sake of pride or ego or whatever. If a spouse asks for help, the other spouse should always help. It's kind of part of being married (which you've committed to do)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
