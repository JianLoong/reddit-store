He pays half the bills, but does not pay rent or insurance, and uses my car as he doesn't have one at the moment. \n\nA week before I was due to visit my family (I'm not able to visit for the holidays), my father called me to ask jf they could stay with me the Thursday and Friday night before I visited. They were to attend an event an hour away, and thought it easier to stay with me than try make the journey twice in one day. I agreed to the Thursday night, but suggested it would be better to travel back on the Friday so we could make the most of the weekend with family in my hometown. My father agreed, but also said to keep the Friday stay over open, just in case (his back is bad). \n\nI did not run it past my boyfriend before agreeing because they're family, my parents helped me out when I was buying this place, and we run a pretty open door house here - if any friend wants to stay they get a key to come and go, even if we are not around - so I didn't think there would be an issue. \n\nMy boyfriend had plans already for the Thursday, that was ok, I told him my parents made their plans last minute, and not to cancel anything. I asked him not to invite people around the Friday night just in case my parents did decide to stay. I didn't think it was going to be an issue because we rarely have people around, and he hadn't said he was thinking of organising anything. The request did not go down well. He said I was taking away his autonomy, and making it impossible for him to make any plans for his Friday. When I asked if he had already invited people he said no, but that I was taking that choice away from him. He said my parents shouldn't feel like they can just invite themselves to stay whenever suits them. \n\nI pointed out that I hadn't asked him to not make any plans, just not invite people around in case my parents stayed even though it was unlikely. I never ask anything of him, and my parents so rarely visit that I didn't think it was asking too much this one time. He then proceeded to stonewall me until after I returned from my visit to my hometown. I ended up travelling to my hometown with my parents in their car on the Friday, and booking public transport back (8.5hour bus ride) so he would have used of my car over the weekend. Still, he has been a bit awkward and condescending since. I also just found out he has ranted about me while out with a group of mutual friends on said Friday night.\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1703242664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ocd54/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_not_to_invite_people/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stonewalling is a rubbish way to deal with conflict; he\u2019s 42 and behaving like a teenager.

Starting to show his true colors. Scary.\n\nGet rid of him.", "NTA. He's an entitled arse isn't he? It's your house, your car, but he wants control of both.

He's getting practically free lodging and transportation from his gf 10 years younger and still has the gall to accuse you of taking away his autonomy?? Please DTMFA.", "Hun, if he\u2019s stonewalling you, treating you badly and making a big deal about such a small request to his friends why are you with this man? He is 10 years older than you and acting at least 10 years younger. You do not have to stay with someone just because it\u2019s messy to break up. He may have good qualities and I\u2019m sure you have good memories but he doesn\u2019t sound like he respects or likes you at all no matter what he says. His actions speak. Get outta there. You deserve better. If it\u2019s a matter of money advertise for a roommate. Pick someone you\u2019d like to live with who understands that parents drop by sometimes. NTA", "NTA. His ideas are somewhat confused if he thinks that your very reasonable request (in your own house!) has anything whatsoever to do with his autonomy. He was perfectly free to go be with friends somewhere else. You have been bending over backwards to accomodate him with the car. Expect him to reciprocate and respect your efforts. It looks to me that this guy is well on his way to taking you for granted.", "What's up with overgrown children dating people 10 years younger than them? Just lose the boyfriend, he's not worth it.

That old ass man is clearly using you and you\u2019re too blinded by love to say anything and reconsider this relationship ?\n\nYou sound great, do yourself a favour a drop the extra 200lbs", "INFO: why doesn\u2019t he have a car? What was the circumstances he moved in with you\n\nNTA for sure. To me the question is more of is he using you or not. You probably should have asked him first to be fair, but at least as it\u2019s written here, your requests are totally reasonable.", "NTA.\n\nBut your boyfriend is 100% TA.", "NTA. He doesn't sound very mature for his age and sounds like a huge AH. He sounds like he takes everything you do for him for granted. He doesn't pay rent OR insurance, but he willingly uses YOUR CAR and your house and then has the audacity to yell at you for asking him not to invite people over ONE TIME. You even left the car with him for that weekend, even though you clearly needed it!

Using your car? Not paying rent? YTA to yourself!", "NTA\nThis relationship needs a serious review: you don't get to use your own car because he uses it, he rants about autonomy when asked for one night where he can't bring people over,  he threw a tantrum and refused to talk to you (this is what I am getting from atinewalling), and he's bad mouthing you to mutual friends. Why are you with him? His behavior is unacceptable here, he's blowing this out of proportion and expecting you to, what,  say sorry your parents might have stayed over? You need to have a read about coercive control and gaslighting.  There's no way he should have reacted the way he did.", "He's still upset because you didn't learn the lesson he wanted you to learn. You need to ask his permission to invite anyone over to your house. He doesn't tho. Because he's the man, he's in charge. You're not allowed free access to your house. You're not allowed free access to your car. You're not allowed to do a damn thing without his express approval beforehand. \n\nSend him back to his mommy.", "I hate the \u201eOP break up with x\u201c bandwagon, but here I agree, he\u2019s hella toxic and controlling.", "NTA - he is 42. He should be respectful of your family.", "NTA and dump his ass. He's using you and taking advantage of your generosity. You deserve far, far better.", "NTA there are tons of other Fridays he just didn't like that you where telling him what to do or giving him a restriction. You are really toooooo nice\nHe he normally this bossy?", "NTA. I'm sorry, but this dude sounds like an absolute mooch. He pays for virtually nothing, and it seems like you're constantly bending over backward to accommodate him, but the one single time that you make a very reasonable decision, he throws a tantrum and stonewalls you. Does he have any redeeming qualities? Because I'm getting the vibe that he doesn't. Kick this moocher out of your life.", "Interesting how not paying rent or for a car and riding your coattails isn\u2019t taking away his autonomy eh \n\nHe\u2019s 42, he needs to go\n\nNTA", "WTAF? NTA. The audacity of the man. It's completely standard to agree to let immediate family stay, they trump friends, especially if travelling from out of town, let alone someone your partner may or may not feel like inviting that they haven't even spoken to about plans yet. The reaction is so ridiculous as to be either suspicious or problematically controlling. Either way you've got a boyfriend problem.", "NTA. Some commenters have tried to say you are being unreasonable because you own the house and not considered your boyfriend's feelings. Having reread your scenario, I wonder what their response would be if they didn't know you owned the house. \n\nWith your casual open door policy, how do you usually decide who comes to stay and when? Your boyfriend, by his own admission, has no plans for Friday night. You have not asked him to stay home to be with you and your parents, nor have you told him to make sure he is out that evening. All you have asked of him is to not invite anyone to stay on Friday in case your parents need to stay an extra night. That is not taking away his autonomy.\n\nIf he wants to have total control over every aspect of his home, then he needs to live on his own. If anyone is having their autonomy compromised, it is you as you are making more compromises to keep him happy. \n\nStart dropping hints that you may need to move closer to your parents as their health begins to decline, especially with your father's back problems, and see what his reaction is. This would help clarify how he views your relationship.", "NTA - This guys seems to using your resources and thinks he can control you, which you let him. Seems like a deadbeat to me and the 10 year age gap doesn't help. I wonder why none of your friends or family have seen any warning signs yet.", "NTA.\n\n>He pays half the bills, but does not pay rent or insurance, and uses my car as he doesn't have one at the moment. \n\nBoyfriend is a freeloader. Dump his ass and rightfully reclaim your castle Queen!", "NTA but why are you with him? He sounds garbage", "So he moved out of his moms house to move in with you, because: \"My place is closer to friends and his work, and easier access to the city centre.\" I am so sorry, but he is using you. He takes you, your car and house for granted. You do not need his approval to  invite your parents over in your house for a night.", "The boyfriend is 42? Sounds like a teenager. NTA", "He is an entitled jerk. \n\nYou provide the house and the car - and what do you get in return?  Disrespect and garbage about autonomy.  I am very sure you could do better.\n\nNTA", "NTA - but please rethink this relationship", "NTA. He sounds ridiculous. He had full autonomy to see people on the Friday just not in the house where quite reasonably your parents are briefly guests. Wow. The fact he\u2019s still holding this over you suggests he lacks any insight.", "Boyfriend is a whiny, entitled loser; toss him out and change all the locks.\n\nYou're NTA.", "your bf is a parasite", "NTA. You were perfectly reasonable.\n\nBut you should respect his autonomy and ask him for rent.", "So why exactly does your boyfriend think that he has the right to treat YOUR house (that he doesn't pay a dime in rent for) as some kind of flophouse...? (for what I assume are his equally much older friends).\n\nThis behavior is weird and controlling. And frankly is much more in line with a college attitude, not with someone well into middle age.\n\nNTA.", "You were \u201ctaking his autonomy away\u201d by asking him not to invite overnight guests on one particular Friday to YOUR HOUSE THAT YOU OWN? \n\nGirl... \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nNTA but you need to have a good think about how he reacted you making plans for your own house. I don\u2019t care if he pays half the bills. I don\u2019t care if guests are usually a 2 yes/1 no situation. You were being courteous to your parents and giving him advance notice, not throwing a last-minute sleepover.\n\nAlso \u2014 you might need to rethink this open door policy that you have going with friends. I seems great in theory but anyone I know who has had that policy has come to regret it. Not so much because they ended up with squatters but because it meant family or friends stopping by almost every damn day for hours.", "NTA. \n\nHe is manufacturing a conflict because he wants to punish you and create friction around seeing your family. That is a common abuser tactic meant to isolate you from your support system as over time it just gets \u201ceasier\u201d to give him his way and avoid a fight. Maybe take this holiday time apart to think about other ways he makes your life difficult when he\u2019s not the center of your universe and think about how much longer you want to invest in someone who is like this.", "NTA. But you need to dump this guy. He is staying in YOUR home and making demands and even berating you for making your own plans that didn\u2019t even conflict with his. That\u2019s controlling and concerning. He\u2019s using YOUR car and more than doubling your travel time for your visit home. This guy is a user. He\u2019s got a good thing going with a girlfriend who not only subsidizes his living but who is malleable enough to let him boss her around and then worry if she\u2019s an AH. The red flags are abundant here. Give this guy notice to move out and change the locks. And take back your car keys.", "I'm constantly baffled by women who insist on being with these losers. Girl he is trying to tell you you can't have your own family over when he doesn't have any plans for others to be there in your house using your car and paying for hardly anything. He is the ultimate hobosexual, but actually trying to take ownership.\n\nYTA for putting up with this nonsense. Grow a spine.", "You\u2019re the asshole for staying with this jerk. Your house, he doesn\u2019t pay rent, and then stonewalls you and talks behind your back. You\u2019re in this relationship why?", "NTA but seriously, he\u2019s in YOUR house and using YOUR car whilst you ride the bus? This guy is treating you like a total doormat. You sound very nice and eager to help people and he is totally taking advantage of that. Find yourself someone who treats you like you treat other people and respects you", "What a jerk your bf is.  This is YOUR house & it's your parents ffs.  He didn't have plans for that Friday, yet he's upset with you for taking away his choice?  What is he 5?  Give me a break.  Your boyfriend is a complete asshole.  NTA.  You are entitled to have your parents stay at your own home whenever you see fit.", "NTA. Dump this ungrateful oxygen thief, he can move back in with his mummy. He sounds utterly pathetic, honestly.", "NTA this is concerning behavior. It would be over for me.", "NTA!\n\n10 years older than you, no rent, and complains about you taking \"his autonomy\" away while shamelessly trying to take yours and trying to keep you from having your parents over in /your/ house that they helped you get!", "NTA.  Why is he still living with you?  It's your house that he lives in rent free.  Your parents helped you acquire this house.  He gets NO say so!  I would have NEVER taken public transportation to leave this AH MY car!  Then to talk crap about you to his friends.  F THAT!  Give yourself a Christmas gift and kick him out!", "So he lived with his mother at the age of 40????? Did she have any health concerns? Or are you just his new mum that he gets to sleep with and control?", "NTA he\u2019s weird", "Can someone with some technical know-how *please* just build a bot for this sub that automatically dishes out \u201cNTA, get away from that useless partner ASAP\u201d ratings whenever some large age-gap couple is clearly in a garbage relationship?\n\nOtherwise we may as well name this sub, \u201cMy boyfriend/fiance/husband is 10+ years older than me and treats me like shit but I have no self-love so need internet strangers to tell me that obvious emotionally abusive behavior is obvious.\u201d\n\nNTA because I need to put in a rating.", "NTA. \n\nI think I need to stop coming to this sub. These constant posts where one person is behaving like a fucking lunatic and the other person comes here to ask, \"which of us is wrong?\" when any reasonable person on the planet can see very clearly who was wrong are just exhausting to read over and over again. It's hard for me to even comprehend so many people letting their partners walk all over them and treat them so poorly.", "NTA.\n\nI was on the edge of Y T A because I think guests staying over should always be a joint decision, but apparently the two of you have an open door policy so that's moot.  The \"taking away his autonomy, and making it impossible for him to make any plans for his Friday\" is seriously over the top.  Hopefully it's something simple such as he doesn't like your parents but doesn't know how to tell you that so he blurted out random nonsense instead.\n\nThis isn't a \"break up this second because of 8 million screaming red flags\" but it does merit a serious talk to get to the root of the problem because right now he's being a (seemingly) unwarranted AH.", "He yelled at you and you still let him use your car???", "Excuse me, but why were you explaining and justifying your actions to your leech of a boyfriend who obviously thinks he's got a cushy situation there and feels entitled to treat you like that?  Is this where you want your future to go?  You are NTA, but I certainly hope you take a very, very hard look at him and your relationship and think really hard about it.", "NTA  \nIs your BF always such a huge AH or was this a special performance? It really seems like a bizarre reaction.  \n***\"He said I was taking away his autonomy*** ...***\"***   \nWHAT?????", "Y T A for enabling this moocher to mooch of you, to be condescending to you and to basically walk all over you.\n\nYou can't make any plans in YOUR house for ONE evening because it'll take away the option for your boyfriend to possibly make plans IN YOUR HOUSE for that evening?\n\nTHEN you spend 8.5 hours in a bus because you let BF use your car?\n\nHello doormat, time to grow a spine.\n\nNTA \n\nBTW", "NTA. I'm getting vibes that he wants to cut you off from your family by making them a major inconvenience. He sounds awful. I hope you start to realize you deserve better than a man who wants to control you.", "If you live together, it wasn't great of you to make a unilateral decision about scheduling, Even if the house is officially yours and not his.  You live together, you share a social life as a couple, it'd be better to make mutual decisions about matters of mutual interest... or at least keep up the pretense of it.\n\nHowever, his reaction to a tiny unilateral decision was so extreme, that now I wonder why you want such an angry and short-tempered person around. A simple \"Honey, please don't make decisions about guests without talking to me first\" would have done.", "OK so for the actual question in the title, not the asshole. It was a reasonable request.\n\nBut! \n\n>I did not run it past my boyfriend before agreeing\n\nY T A for that because it is his home too. You don't invite overnight guests into someone's home without discussing it first, even if that home is also your home.\n\nThe whole ownership issue, \"but it's mine, he doesn't pay rent\", is irrelevant. It is his *home*. But the way you talk about it and treat him regarding it makes it very clear you don't respect that and that you seem to hold this \"ownership\" over his head as a power play. Don't. So I can see why he's pissed; although he is being an arse for the way he's treated you since. And he's a mooch. In fact, there seems to be very little mutual respect in this relationship. Might wanna work on that.\n\n\nESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He can move back in with his mommy.", "So he has never been independent and has always lived with someone else and feels fine telling you who you can have in your house. This guy treats you badly and takes advantage of you. Keeping your car while you're on an 8 hour bus ride, while not talking to you but talking shit about you? He doesn't even like you anymore. But he'll use you as long as possible.", "You do realize he's using you right?", "I'm guessing that since he doesn't pay rent (to help with the mortgage) he doesn't help with property taxes or insurance and other costs since he's got a free place to live. NTA but definitely kick out the freeloader since he's bound to only get worse and testing boundaries/what he can get away with now"]}
