We\u2019ve been together 5+ years now, and this hasn\u2019t been an issue until recently. \n\nEvery single conversation we have somehow turns into him talking about how much money his family has. For example, the other day he got a suit for his sisters wedding and he was like \u201cyeah the jacket alone was $800.00. Perks of having rich parents I guess.\u201d Another time we were talking about a drink his dad made him and he was like \u201cyou wanna know how much the cherries for the drink were? Like $50.00.\u201d He was talking about his fafsa and he said \u201cyeah I had to ask my parents how much they make to fill it out. Do you want to know how much?\u201d Yesterday he went on for like an hour about how his dad just got a promotion to CEO & now they will be making even more than before. Or like, he got his moms old car (2016) when she got a new one, and he would not stop talking about how his parents were able\nTo afford to buy her a new car (like brand new, 2022) out of pocket in cash. That was like a week long conversation . \n\nThese are just some recent ones that I can think of off the top of my head, but basically every conversation takes a turn to \u201cyeah my parents are like millionaires\u201d or \u201cyeah they are out doing rich people things\u201d (yes he\u2019s said that exact thing before) or like \u201cyou want to know how much my parents made last year?\u201d \u201cYou want to know how much x cost?\u201d At this point, though, it\u2019s just getting obnoxious. \n\nI know this may sound a little bit like I\u2019m jealous, but I\u2019m really not. I have always had everything I\u2019ve needed & then some. My family is amazing & takes incredible care of me. Im incredibly fortunate. Im just getting so tired of hearing him talk about how rich is parents are all the time; like o get it dude, great. I guess my question is Would I be the asshole if I asked him to stop making every conversation about that? It\u2019s just getting boring to hear about every day, but I don\u2019t want to be shitty in doing such.

You would not be as asshole to tell him it\u2019s annoying and unnecessary but you might want to question being in a relationship with somebody that immature.", "NTA but its strange that his behavior has shifted more recently than when you first got together. Could he suddenly be hanging out with crass people who love to boast endlessly about their financial strata? Either way, the longer it goes on, the more it\u2019s going to put a strain on your relationship.", "A sort of subtle thing I noticed is that at this supposed level of \u201cwealth\u201d, you would certainly not even be filling out a FAFSA. Somethings off. But anyway NTA", "NTA, bragging like that is super annoying. However, as a side note if it\u2019s been just a recent thing he\u2019s started doing then something is going on that you should probably check on.\n\nIf he just started it could be overcompensating for a financial upset in his family that he isn\u2019t telling anyone about (someone lost a job, got a pay cut, something like that) \n\nAnother thing it could be is he could be feeling insecure about himself for some reason and is using his families money to brag about something to make himself feel better.\n\nIt\u2019s weird when behavior suddenly changes and it usually changes for a reason. I\u2019d start by asking him why he\u2019s been doing it recently and try to dig into it, then tell him to stop.", "BF sounds like he\u2019s from new $$.

Seems like you\u2019ve simply gotten tired of him, and I don\u2019t blame you for that. Relationships fizzle out sometimes. It takes time to get to know someone, and as you\u2019ve gotten to know him, you have come to realize he\u2019s a pompous, obnoxious person, and you clearly don\u2019t enjoy the company of someone like that. You are young, why would you waste your time trying to change him instead of just moving on? There are plenty of better people in the world to spend time with. Free yourself from that bore.", "UGH!

His behavior would be a dealbreaker for me.", "NTA - my favourite phrase for these situations...'money doesn't shout, it whispers' \n\nAlso, old money rich, they don't flaunt like that, it's unbecoming and tacky.", "NTA, his parents money is somehow his entire personality.", "I dated a guy who liked to talk about his brand name clothes. I could not care less about labels. I dumped him. Needed some deeper conversation. YWNBTA.", "NTA- socially, you need to tell him that while he is fortunate and isn\u2019t polite to talk about money all the time. \n\nThe class issue can be huge though and might come out in other ways. He might think he \u201capplied\u201d for an amazing internship but it was a friend of his parents who gave it to him. Or think he\u2019s \u201cearned\u201d a job or promotion, when it really was just given to him due to a connection through his parents or through something his family\u2019s status bought. \n\nDating him might also benefit you, and these connections might help you too but it sounds like you find this to be a turn off. Being middle class, there might be things you do, like trips and vacations, special nights out, and other things, that working class people might see as luxuries. The way you see his bragging might be something I do around poorer people and you might not see it.", "Ditch his pompous ass", "NTA. It's quite difficult to convey that you don't want him to keep bragging about his parents' money 24/7 without coming off as petty.", "NTA - That behavior is quite \u2026 gauche, and probably something totally ok to do as a teenager in that income bracket (I wouldn\u2019t know though).  Sounds like he\u2019s been quite insulated in his bubble to find this to be as cringy as it is. Maybe you spend some time together outside of his little bubble.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
