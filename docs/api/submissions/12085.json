Some of it is still ongoing but not as bad as before. Fiance (31M) is part of this majority ethnic group.\n\nA month ago, Sis has announced to my family that she intends to marry Fiance in April. He proposed to her the night before.\n\nMy family disapproved of it because of our ethnic divide. I initially was happy because Fiance\u2019s younger brother (23) is a close friend of mine, and I also knew Fiance as a generous and hardworking man.\n\nLast week I decided to go around Fiance\u2019s social media and came across his father\u2019s account. The man had reposted several racist statements to my ethnic group along with other minorities, and I was shocked at his subscription to the nationalistic account.\n\nThen, Fiance\u2019s brother had told me that one of his uncles was part of a very nationalistic militia that had caused bad issues to even my own family members. Of course, being my friend, he did not say that out of pride at all and he reaffirmed me that he condemns his uncle\u2019s actions and beliefs.\n\nFiance\u2019s family is wealthy. This puts him at a much higher level than Sis in the eyes of my country.\n\nSis is also a considerably conflictive person. She has gotten into arguments with Fiance over small things and complained to me about them a lot. She also has a small history of being unfaithful to one of her former boyfriends. \n\nLast week, she complained about yet another argument, this one being about Sis thinking Lover was staring at other women. I was scared even more at this point and decided to give Sis a reality check on Fiance\u2019s socioeconomic status compared to ours, and if he were to divorce her the least of her worries should be losing everything of value.\n\nSis exploded with anger. She said that Fiance would never do such a thing, to which I responded with how I fear Fiance\u2019s family and not Fiance himself.\n\nI told some of my cousins that live in England and Canada about what I told Sis. Some of them called me racist, but I find it difficult to take their accusations seriously as they do not know what we have suffered first-hand. My father surprisingly did not like my comment, but he said it was just because I am giving Sis too much to fear.  \n\nMy mother, Fiance\u2019s brother, and other family members did tell me I was right, though it is also difficult to take my family seriously as they are by default very disapproving of Fiance and his family.

I think NTA but I'm also curious to know more. How old was your sister when she met her bf and when they started dating?", "NAH because I think this is a complex racial and socioeconomic issue that most people on this forum can\u2019t give real substantial advice or judgement on.", "NTA according to additional info in OP's comments an almost 30 year old man was pursuing an underage girl and his family has involvement in a ethnic-based militia that may have HARMED OP'S FAMILY.\n\n Not blaming kids for the racist views of their parents is one thing not wanting your sister to marry into a family where if fiance sours on her their whole family could potentially get killed is another entirely.", "NAH. It sounds like you're worried for her safety; if her partner's family members disapprove of their marriage, or if the marriage were to fall apart and they divorced for whatever reason, you worry that those racist family members might harm your sister. You're scared for her and are trying to tell her about possible risks, and that's understandable. But she loves this man, and arguments and conflicts are part of a relationship, the main thing is how it's dealt with. If they want to get married and be together, you need to support her. I understand your concerns but I'm sure you can understand why she'd rather marry someone she loves than end things because of his horrible family members' views.", "You're NTA, and honestly anybody that does not know about the history of the lynching and discrimination that still happens to this day (in America) would not understand were you coming from.\n\nThe socioeconomic difference ties into the racial divide that makes it really difficult for the majority to understand the minority ( EVEN when they WANT TOO) . Your sister sounds like she's not experience to the reality that at the BEST she wouldn't get the respect she deserves from the father and uncle.", "NTA: The fact that the Fianc\u00e9s own brother is agreeing with what you are saying goes a long way. He obviously knows his family background much better than you or your sister.", "NTA, you are trying to give your sister socioeconomic context. This is not actually about ethnicity, it's about power, which in your country happens to be drawn along ethnic lines. Your sister is old enough to be getting married, so she's old enough to learn to be aware of social power dynamics. Information and awareness isn't about fear, it's about making informed and wise decisions, and choosing with who and where and when to disclose personal truths.", "NTA. You're not discriminating simply because the fiance is a different race, you're discriminating because his family has hateful attitudes toward your and your sister's race. It *could* be the case that marrying into that family will put her in a dangerous situation.", "OP, what are Lover's views on the matters that you have discussed?", "Mixed feelings here because there is racism involved. I think 20 is too young to get married, but she is an adult and it's her choice. It's ridiculous to judge a guy because his relatives have racist views. In my opinion, your only concern should be her age and getting married. Keep in mind that the more you push any of this, the more she will fight back.

And tbh, none of the information in the post has any bearing on whether you should be involved. Not your marriage. Not your monkeys.", "YTA\n\nYou're throwing around a whole lot of conjecture here.

You keep referring to him as \u201cLover\u201d rather than sister\u2019s boyfriend/fianc\u00e9/your future brother in law, and that right there tells me you already have zero respect for him or take their relationship seriously. You\u2019ve already stated that your entire family has a problem with the \u201cethnic divide\u201d, and you want to sabotage the engagement because of his socioeconomic status and the fact that he has racist family members (news flash-so do you).

Without knowing more about your cultural context it's hard to pass judgment on specific details, but I have some familiarity with some situations I think are probably analogous. \n\nI think your concern is reasonable and founded in care for her, as well as for the family at large. It's not wrong to want to raise it with her and make sure she's thought through this aspect of the relationship. Fiance's brother's/your friend's reaction further supports this. If I were you, I'd be very interested to know whether Fiance has informed his own family and how the older members reacted to the news that he wants to marry a girl of your ethnicity; that would definitely inform how concerned I'd be in your shoes. \n\nAt the same time, it's understandable that she and others close to the situation might react poorly to your concerns because it is all extremely touchy and sensitive - it just is. Plus, she's young and in love. In any country, nobody young and in love likes to hear a reason why their relationship might not be a good idea :)\n\nI wish you all the very best in navigating this, however it goes.", "I feel like we can't really answer this without knowing a lot more details about the specifics of the ethnic conflict and power dynamics involved.

She\u2019s 20 and he\u2019s 31. A whirlwind romance and a monthlong engagement until she\u2019s tied to a notably racist and powerful family?

If he's wealthy, you can't guarantee she *just* wants love vs say escaping an overprotective family that doesn't respect boundaries. He might be racist, he might not. If he is, she'll learn the hard way. Either way, she obviously knew he was a majority getting into this so it wouldn't be a total surprise.", "YTA - mind your business.", "YTA: For your misogynist views of your sister.

Western culture or not I don't think it's a matter of seeing it from a western lens. I'm seeing this as a woman who is also a cultural minority. \n\nThe sister is correct to be worried about the discrimination that might occur when marrying into a family of a different culture. When you also take into account that the groom to be is much older yeah she's right to be worried because there will be a power imbalance.

Thank you for informing me though.", "As I said in my post, I am not scared of Fiance himself but rather his family, as they have enough power to meddle in Sis and Fiance\u2019s affairs.
