{"id": 8100, "submission_id": "10jodtz", "title": "AITA for not wanting my live-in boyfriend to go home to his parents multiple times a week?", "selftext": "I (25F) and my boyfriend (25M) just moved in together after 7 years of dating; we met freshman year of college in English class. He has lived with his parents since\u2026 birth, I guess. I moved out as soon as I turned 18. I am decently close with my family, but not anywhere NEAR how close he is with his. He makes it a point to \u201chang out\u201d with his sister and parents in the same way that I would \u201chang out\u201d with my friends. Ever since we moved in, he has made it a point to go home whenever possible: to pick up more clothes, to do laundry, etc. The thing is, he spends ALL DAY there to hang out with his mom and dad\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but at age 25, shouldn\u2019t you be excited to move out And not have to see your parents 24/7? I just think it\u2018s really weird that he is over at his parents\u2019 house and/or going out to dinner with his parents 2-3 times a week\u2026 Shouldn\u2018t he want to be independent at this age? Anyway, I get annoyed at him when he decides he wants to go home to do laundry as I know it will be at least an all day event. This especially annoys me when we have specific dinner plans (i.e., plans to have Taco Tuesday that are interrupted by his need to be around his family). He thinks I\u2019m trying to keep him from his family, but in reality I am trying to foster independence. Again, at age 25, you should not have to see your mommy multiple times a week to function. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: things I will add for context.\n\n1. the laundry units in our apartment building work perfectly fine, it is coin operated.\n2. His family lives 20 min away.\n3. I mentioned a concern that going home every time he needs to do laundry may get to be too much and he should sometimes opt to do it in the apartment building; he got really annoyed at me for even suggesting this.\n4. Another reason he wants to go home is because his dad is making Swedish meatballs for dinner\u2026 sorry, that\u2019s just kinda what you miss out on when you move out\u2026\n\nEDIT 2: I am extremely close with both of my parents (like, have hour long conversations with them on the daily) but I do not let it affect my relationship or the closeness between us. I am NOT trying to isolate him from his family - I\u2018m glad he has a relationship with them, but it\u2019s coming between us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 3: These additional points got buried in the comments Regarding my relationship. \n\n1. I AM NOT TRYING TO ISOLATE HIM FROM HIS FAMILY. Jesus Christ. I am not an abuser, nor am I controlling, nor am I a narcissist. I am just finally at my breaking point after 7 years of mama\u2019s boy activities. \n2. I don\u2019t give a fuck that he\u2019s spending time with his family. I spend times with mine too. The issue I have is that he can\u2019t cook, clean up after himself, etc. and has to go home to get these basics done for him. I do 90% of the cooking and cleaning. We are responsible for our own laundry. I am unsure if he does his own laundry at home - he says he does but idk for sure.\n3. He does not invite me when he goes home or to dinner with his family. i believe this is to avoid conflict between myself (anti-racist) and his father (lover of the n-word). It could also be that he uses his family time to relax and recharge, which is fine, but this is not communicated to me that he is needing alone time. (We are white, all of us, even me). \n4. again, I do not take issue that he is hanging out with his family. I take issue that he has to go home because he is unable to function at home. I also take issue That if he has homesickness or something he is not communicating this to me. \n5. He compares me to his parents. Examples: \u201cMy dad does it this way.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t make that meal. If I wanted that meal, I would go home, my mom makes it really good.\u201d It is exhausting. \n6. His family does like me, despite the conflict between myself and his dad. I get along very well with his family Outside of the racism of course. \\[As a white person it\u2019s kind of hard to avoid racist people. My boyfriend has never said anything racist in front of me.\\]", "created_utc": 1674510104, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jodtz/aita_for_not_wanting_my_livein_boyfriend_to_go/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's also ok for him to be close to his family. The solution is some amount of compromise, accepting that he is going to visit, or accepting that there is an incompatibility.\n\nI would agree that 2-3 times a week is a lot but I visit my parents around once a month with them being in town and like being independent. Some people just like being super close like that. It can be a cultural thing too.\n\nHis excuses and reasons are weak but probably because he just doesn't feel comfortable expressing the basic idea of just wanting to be close and see them all the time.", "You have differing priorities. While you want to move out and be independent, your boyfriend wants to move out and still retain a close relationship with his family. Maybe have an agreement that you go WITH him for dinner once a week? That way you\u2019re included, it\u2019s a couple activity. \n\nOr, ya know, if you can\u2019t communicate your needs and discuss a solution that works for you both, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be living together. \n\nNAH", "NAH, sounds like a difference in priorities as others have said.\n\nYou mentioned elsewhere that you feel he prioritizes his family over you - that is a red flag and something the two of you need to talk over.\n\nIf this isn't something he will budge on and it's not something you want to live with for the rest of your life, then maybe this relationship has run its course.", "YTA the dude just moved out for the first time, let him find his balance. The only thing he does that isnt okay is if he cancels every time you have plans. But heres a tip, if you want to help him find the balance, dont say something as condescending as \"you should not have to see your mommy multiple times a week to function\"\n\nEDIT: Also as other redditors point out, youve been with this dude for 7 years, and his relationship to his family comes as a surprise?", "NAH y\u2019all aren\u2019t compatible", "Didn't it occur to you that maybe he spends time with his family because\u2026 idk\u2026 he loves them? It\u2019s not up to you to decide what's \"weird\" and what not. Clearly you have different views, different familiar backgrounds, but you sound extremely judging of them. \n\nYTA", "Nta, your bf is basically only home half of the time. He doesn\u2019t invite for he only wants to spend time with his family. After seven years does he not see you as family too? \n\nImagine he was out this often for friends then everybody would probably say you have a right be upset. Instead you are being called controlling. When your bf is constantly comparing you to his parents which is not okay. He canceling plans on you. He takes offense to bringing up how much time he spends over there. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t sound like he ready for serious relationship and may not be for a few years..", "Nta 2-3 times every week is a bit much. It wouldn\u2019t be compatible to me personally if a partner did that.\n\nEdit: your not even invited???? That\u2019s bs. Complete bs.", "INFO\n\nDid you know he was like that before you moved in with him?", "NAH. I think you are just different people.", "NTA - I also eagerly moved out at 17 and have never \u201cbeen home\u201d for more than a week or so since. I talk with my dad a couple of times a month and my brother a few times a year. This is fine with me and my family.  His is a very  different family dynamic. I\u2019m not necessarily saying his is wrong, but it sure as hell isn\u2019t mine and I would have a tough time dealing with this in a potential partner myself.", "NAH, just the usual lack of communication. He needs time to become comfortable away from family. You need to stop being controlling. Work out a schedule together so his visits don\u2019t clash with your plans. Why not join him occasionally? If this relationship is going to work, his family will be your family, too.", "NTA, and please don\u2019t stay with this man. If after 7 years he\u2019s still putting his mega racist parents first, he\u2019s never going to change. Do you really want to spend your whole life playing second fiddle to his parents?", "YTA.  Sounds like you both have different ideas about a relationship and you're trying to to be controlling and isolate him from his family.   You just moved in.  It sounds like you are both figuring this out.  Or maybe he's helping his parents around the house and things.  \n\nThough honestly, I'd probably go do laundry where it's free than having to pay and share the laundry machines with others.\n\nI'm in for the Swedish meatballs.  Why don't you go with him sometimes and see what's going on?", "NTA. I find it odd to not want to be independent at age 25. Going home to do laundry is definitely odd how is that not more effort to take it there and back guessing it\u2019s just used as an excuse to go to his family. You may find that this gets better in time. It may not though in which case you have to accept it or re-assess your relationship.", "NAH. \n\nHe definitely has strong ties with his family and enjoys spending time with them. \n\nYou have some valid concerns as it's affecting your relationship with him in a day to day situation. \n\nProbably best to voice your side, and work on a middle ground where he gets to continue his relationship with his family without holding back the growth of your relationship.", "YTA unless there\u2019s some gross behavior going on, sounds like he just loves them. My husband is very much the same way.", "I was all set with YTA when I saw the title, and then I read ops responses! Holy moly NTA this kid thinks he's visiting you and still living at home. Good luck getting that turned around!", "NTA. My husband put his mother and father and sister before me over and over. He would cancel dates to be with them. Bought them expensive gifts instead of me or our children. Let them keep our children whenever they wanted whether I wanted it or not. Our last child he left me alone at the hospital instead of spending the night in the hospital with us. So he could be with them. It was that sort of thing over and over. If it\u2019s a problem now, it won\u2019t get better. It never did with us. He never understood my concerns either. He basically gaslit me over them. (That wasn\u2019t a term then and I felt like a fool for my concerns.)", "NAH, but probably a good sign to breakup.  If it\u2019s still an issue, it will always be an issue.  You guys may just have different ideas about free time, family, etc. And that\u2019s OK. \n\nYou could try to talk to him about how it hurts your feelings when he disregards the plans you two have together (really for any reason).", "Info: is this something you are willing to put up with forever? For you, and any children you have together to come second to his family?\n\nIt may just be time for this relationship to come to a natural end.  You don\u2019t sound happy with the way things are, he won\u2019t be happy changing things.  It may just be you are at different stages of your life, which is ok.\n\nNAH.", "INFO: did you not talk about this before you moved in?\n\nWhy aren\u2019t you invited?", "I've heard of live-in nanny, but not boyfriend....\nLols aside, you've known him for 7 years and you didn't figure it out? He will not change coz he feels comfortable the way he is. You either get used to it or break up. YTA, having good relationship with family is not some kind of disease", "ESH.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting to spend time with your family, but if he has plans with you and breaks them on a whim, that's rude.\n\nLet him spend time at home, but make it clear he needs to follow through on plans with you.", "Need more info. Not trying to be an alarmist here, but have you verified he is actually at his parents house? I mean, it just sounds kind of strange. And if he\u2019s canceling dinner plans with you so he can eat dinner with his fam, why aren\u2019t you being invited?", "NAH. Let's be fair, him going home to do laundry every week as a grown ass man is kinda weird. That's going to hit you on a primal level as you try to establish your home life with him.\n\nI understand your emotions, but ultimately you are going to need to accept his love for family and wanting to spend time with them. That's more than fair of him to expect, and would only be weird if he purposely excluded you (sounds like you aren't interested).\n\nHe probably sees laundry as a convenient excuse to see his family. I'm not sure the best way to approach that subject, he will likely get defensive. \n\nWhat is your line? How much time is too much time to spend with family? Sounds like you had an idea of how things would go when you moved in together and it isn't that at all. Might need to adjust your perspective/expectations if this guy is worth it.", "I had a boyfriend like this in my 20s. We could never make weekend plans because he had to go home to Mommy. Or we would make plans, but he'd forget, and jump out of bed Saturday morning & go to Mom's while I was in the shower or something. He was just super immature, which manifested many ways. So basically I think you need a different boyfriend with different priorities & who's more on the same page as you. Current one isn't, and that's fine for him; he doesn't need to change & you're not going to be able to change him. Change your own situation & ditch the momma's boy like I did.", "YTA - You clearly have different expectations of how to interact with family, but having dated for 7 years, you should know how he is. Expecting him to change because you finally moved in together without communicating to him what you expected to change and receiving his agreement makes yta.", "ESH\n\nHe shouldn't cancel plans with you, and I think it is completely reasonable for you to want protected time just the two of you.\n\nHowever, being close to his family and wanting to visit a lot does not mean he isn't \"independent\" - I am 32f and married with a kid, own my own house, and during a week I will always see my parents and my sister at least once.  We are a super close family and I consider my sister my best friend.  This does not mean I am not independent, I just really love and get on with my family.  \n\nI really think you both need to have a proper conversation and listen actively to each others point of view, but as advice to yourself, your current attitude is really condescending and probably needs to be reassessed before you can have a successful conversation.", "NTA.  However, you don't have a boyfriend.  You have a fwb who is kind enough to help you with the rent.\n\nYou need to cut the apron strings and move on to somebody who is ready to grow up.", "NTA You guys have been dating for 7 years and are now living together and he spends a substantial amount of time at his parent\u2019s house or with his family, but you\u2019re not actually invited to these hangouts, because you\u2019d be \u201cintruding\u201d on time with his family?? Girl, you should\u2019ve lead with that instead of leaving it to be buried in the comments! Either way, I\u2019m of the opinion that he actually does spend way too much time over there that he might as well just move back. His hangout time with them is consistently taking priority over time spent with you as in he will actively choose to interrupt plans with you in favor of being with them. You\u2019re practically being neglected as a partner, and after all this time, he doesn\u2019t consider you as family or even close to as important to them. Anyone would feel hurt and annoyed. \n\nYou probably don\u2019t want to hear this, but maybe you should sit and evaluate if you can truly be happy with this situation for the rest of your life if nothing changes, and maybe make some hard decisions.\n\nETA: his dad is also a raging bigot and your boyfriend would rather hang out with him, without you, because he\u2019d rather not have you pointing out that dad\u2019s behavior is unacceptable. Do you really want that man to be your future father in law? And do you want to put up with him and your boyfriend defending him (and probably defending any other bigot that might stumble into your lives) for as long as dad lives?", "I think it\u2019s entirely reasonable to have expectations on your partner\u2019s maturity and being hurt when he disregards your feelings. I would say there is a lot more beneath the surface of what this issue is, even after 7 years he still treats you as an outsider to his family even to the point that he is creating a competitive relationship between you and his parents by saying \u201cthey make this better\u201d. \nI can\u2019t tell you exactly but I would say this entire situation looks like he might be masking commitment issues with dependency on his parents", "I say overall YTA\n\nIt is not unreasonable for people to continue to have enjoyable relationships with their family.  \n\nNow whether that aligns with what you want is a different thing.  If you don't like his relationship, don't be with him.  But don't ask him to choose.  He's going to choose them.", "YTA. It sounds like he just has a close family bond, and it sounds like you're projecting because you moved out at 18.", "YTA. Just because you're not close to your family doesn't mean his relationship with his is dysfunctional. \n\nClearly he values his time with them (maybe more than he does his time with you). **That's a you/him problem** that has nothing to do with his parents. Sounds like he doesn't see your relationship in the same way you do.", "YTA I mean sure it's not what I would chose to do but I'm not that close to my parents, don't think there's anything wrong with it though. You're not fostering independence in anyway here.", "Info: Have you talked to him straight-up about how you feel like this is damaging your relationship? Not about the specifics (I know you mentioned asking him about laundry, for example) but saying \"I feel like you spend so much time with your family that I don't get to spend time with you/that it's impacting our relationship/etc.\" on top of \"Why am I never included in these things?\"\n\nY'all need to communicate more.", "YTA. You are in fact trying to keep him from his family. YOU want independence at this age, but he doesn't. You two just don't seem compatible. Unless you want to start joining him in his family hangouts, you might want to rethink this relationship.", "NTA, unless his parents have an illness that requires a ton of living assistance to manage, being attached to the hip with mom and dad like this at 25 is awkward. \n\nNot so much the fact that he spends a lot of time with them, but the fact that he does all his laundry at their house/it\u2019s an all day event,  he still stores stuff in their home, plus he interrupts plans with you to be with them.\n\nBut you can\u2019t change him. All you can do is what you think is best for yourself. If this is dealbreaker for you, prepare for a breakup.", "YTA\n\nLet the guy have his meatballs", "I think im gonna say NAH, unless he continues to do it after a much longer period of time (I know you said recently moved in together, idk how recent)\nPlus I did see you mention you actually saw him more often when he lived with them. Thats an interesting observation. \n\nIm 25 and still live with my parents, and it would be a huggeee adjustment leaving (im sticking for financial reasons for the most part) so I can see both sides of it. I do think you should try to address your concerns politely though. He seems to have a harder time adjusting to not living with them. Yeah its fine to visit every once in a while (especially with them being so close by) but a couple times a week for almost the entire day, when it\u2019s interfering with plans, that does seem a bit concerning if its going to continue to happen.", "OP, I understand where you are coming from, but I think YTA in this situation. I think ultimately the problem isn't the time he is spending with his family, I think the issue is (1) You want him to spend more time WITH YOU and prioritize your activities together (2) You don't want him to expect your home life to be just like his family (3) You don't want to be compared to his family like they do everything best and (4) He isn't telling you that he plans on staying there all day, which kind of leaves you hanging. All of those are valid points, but the way you are coming across, it sounds like you think he is immature or something is wrong with him just because he enjoys his family. He was living with them until now, so I think you should have expected that he wasn't someone who was going to just leave the nest and never look back. \n\nInstead of being angry about this, why don't you talk to him about the valid issues you have? Why it bothers you, how it makes you feel, what kind of compromises you each can make, what your expectations are going forward, etc. He JUST moved out. Give him some time, and focus on the specific things that are a problem for you instead of making his family the issue.", "YTA. Some of us actually like our families and want to spend time with them. It\u2019s not a chore or obligation to see them. I\u2019m 30 years old and hanging out with my mom is one of my favourite things to do. \n\nWanting to hang out with his parents doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t independent, it could just mean they have a great relationship.", "NTA\n\nThis is why people should move in together before getting engaged/married.

If he\u2019s constantly bailing on your plans together so he can go home, that\u2019s an issue.\n\nThe thing that irks me the most with this post is just how negatively you\u2019re talking about your partner. \n\n> you should not have to see your mommy multiple times a week to function.\n\nThis line alone is incredibly disrespectful. If that\u2019s the way you think towards your partner, even if you don\u2019t verbalize it to him, you seriously need to do some self-reflecting. That kind of mindset is only going to breed resentment in your relationship.\n\nIs there a conversation to be had if you feel like he\u2019s not prioritizing you enough? Sure.

He has lived with his parents since\u2026 birth, I guess. I moved out as soon as I turned 18. I am decently close with my family, but not anywhere NEAR how close he is with his. He makes it a point to \u201chang out\u201d with his sister and parents in the same way that I would \u201chang out\u201d with my friends. Ever since we moved in, he has made it a point to go home whenever possible: to pick up more clothes, to do laundry, etc. The thing is, he spends ALL DAY there to hang out with his mom and dad\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but at age 25, shouldn\u2019t you be excited to move out And not have to see your parents 24/7? I just think it\u2018s really weird that he is over at his parents\u2019 house and/or going out to dinner with his parents 2-3 times a week\u2026 Shouldn\u2018t he want to be independent at this age? Anyway, I get annoyed at him when he decides he wants to go home to do laundry as I know it will be at least an all day event. This especially annoys me when we have specific dinner plans (i.e., plans to have Taco Tuesday that are interrupted by his need to be around his family).

But hon you are not his spouse. You are just his live in girlfriend. If he were to get in some sort of accident and was in the hospital you wouldn't even have any say so. It would be his mother and father.\n\nHaving said all that I don't feel like your feelings and concerns should be diminished in any way And that goes back to my earlier comment about setting up some boundaries if it continues to bother you and if he gets upset or is dismissive of how you feel start thinking about your options.", "YTA.

If his dad doesn\u2019t like me because I don\u2019t tolerate bigotry, that sucks.", "you realize that every comment you write, you guys just sound more and more incompatible, right?", "Yeesh.  They need to break up.", "There\u2019s a difference between doing over to your parents to do your own laundry (I did that all the time when I lived near my parents and didn\u2019t have a washer and dryer) and going over so your Mom can do your laundry. \n\nSimilarly, going over to eat your mom\u2019s cooking has a different ring to it when you never learned to cook for yourself.", "And she had no inkling of this for the 7 YEARS they dated? Weird.", "OP, I say this with lots of love, but\u2026this guy comes with this family, and I don\u2019t think they are for you.\n\nYou sound like a strong, independent, assertive young woman - good for you! But your bf\u2026is not. And you can\u2019t make him grow into one; he has to want to. And I don\u2019t think he does, at least not now or the foreseeable future. \n\nFind your match. It will be well worth it, trust me.", "Your listing more and more red flags as I look at your comments...you realize if you marry those people aren't going anywhere right? They will actually become your family and unless you move states will probably be even more of a presence in his and eventually your life...time to evaluate the future I think.", "I wouldn\u2019t want to voluntarily have a relationship with a racist family. While your bf may not say racist things, he is actively protecting his racist father from being corrected socially. Ergo, bf is still a racist.", "What do you get when 9 people are eating and a Nazi joins them at the table?\n\nTen Nazi's.  (Everyone is complicit.)", "I can\u2019t upvote this enough. The more I scroll down the worse it gets!!!", "I think she was overly hopeful that when he moved out of his parents' house, he would be willing to learn how to be independent. She will know better next time.", "your ergo has jumped to incorrect conclusion", "Honestly cant even argue with that"]}
