You already have a mom. Why would you call your father\u2019s new wife \u201cmom\u201d? That\u2019s some balls to ask you to call her mom.", "YEESH. NTA. I don't think a step parent should EVER ask for this, it should come from the step kid instead. I was in my early twenties when my mom remarried, and if she had told me to call her husband \"Dad\" I would have stopped talking to her altogether. It's an attempt to force a connection that you don't have. It's gross, honestly.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re too old for a new mom, lol.", "NTA. \n\nYou can\u2019t force \u2018call her mom\u2019 on anyone. It\u2019s not meaningful if you\u2019re expected to. \n\nThey created the situation for hurt feelings themselves. It\u2019s not pleasant, and it\u2019s not ideal that you had the reaction that you did \u2014 though it sounds like it was reflexive, not malicious \u2014 but they brought this about through not letting well alone.", "NTA. Kind of bold of them to decide what's appropriate here.", "NTA If you ever felt like calling a second person \"Mom\" then it would be your choice. Strange that this came about when you're not even close. Sad that they put you on the spot. The stepmom should make an attempt at being your friend and nothing more. You already have a mom.", "NTA. I am super close with my (step) daughter. I have raised her since she was 9, her bio dad passed when she was 6. She called me dad(and more often \u2018father\u2019 in a silly serious tone) for the first time when she was about 13 or so. At that time, we had been through a LOT as a family and had just bonded naturally. She still calls me by my first name rather than dad or father probably 75% of the time. She is 22 now.", "NTA. you werent being rude or harsh on purpose, and you just didnt react as well as you could have. it happens, and she'll get over it eventually too. just apologise to her for how the response came off, and it'll be alright. you absolutely do not need to call her mom if you dont want to", "NTA. You have a mom, someone who is still very much an active part of your life. You don't need another mom. Also, it is entirely up to you how you feel about your relationship with your stepmother, and if you did want to call her \"mom\", then the conversation should be led by you. This woman has only been in your life for a year, and you are nearly an adult, so invariably the relationship won't naturally be maternal. If, however, you have nothing against her and want to maintain a good relationship... it might be nice to just let her know that you're glad she's joined the family and call her something else that is only between you both.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. Even if you were younger and your bio mom wasn\u2019t in your life and the role was wide open, it\u2019s ultimately your decision and it should happen organically.", "Nope, definitely NTA. I would have chuckled or laughed also and for the exact same reasons as you did.", "NTA. At 17 that's an unreasonable expectation. It's also unreasonable at 6 mos. You're nearly an adult and have a mom.", "NTA. Your dad and stepmom had a lot of nerve to think they could dictate what you call her, especially when your actual mom is still in your life. \n\nP.S. Considering that yesterday was April Fools Day, I would have laughed too.", "Nta\n\nI wouldn't give you any grief for chuckling because that is so left field you were probably caught off guard. Honestly, someone who has been in your life for under two years wants to be called mom? And your mother is alive and well? She has some unreasonable expectations and they aren't your responsibility.", "NTA. You have a mom. \n\nAnother woman coming into your life two years ago and asking to be called mom by you, is ridiculous. I would laugh too. Just because she married your dad, does not make her your mom.", "NAH - you genuinely thought it was a joke (I don't see why anyone would joke like that, but kinda understand if you're just not close). It wasn't nice at all to laugh at the suggestion because they seem like they genuinely care, but you clearly didn't mean to hurt them.", "NAH \n\nLike you said, she didn't raise you and you're nearly grown.\n\nAlso, sorry for asking, is your mother in your life? Cause if so, I will say that's an inappropriate thing for your dad to ask. \n\nThat being said, your dad was understanding when you said no. So either way I can't call him TA. \n\nYour stepmom being sad about it though makes me think your dad asked on her behalf. Maybe your stepmom wants to be closer to you?", "Relationships are a house of cards, they take a lot of time and care to build up, and are easy to destroy. Your SM was trying to skip a lot of foundational steps. NTA, they were just being unrealistic", "You should go apologize for laughing and say something nice about her while maintaining the position that you're not comfortable calling her mom.", "I mean, you\u2019re not not an asshole.", "YTA for laughing but you don\u2019t have to call her mom. I don\u2019t believe you thought it was a joke, there\u2019s nothing funny about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In all honesty I also think that this was a fairly odd thing for them to ask because:\n\n1. As you\u2019ve said you\u2019re almost 18 and will be out  of the house soon. \n2. She\u2019s only been around for about 1.5 years, and married to your dad for a whopping 6 months. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s been an extra parental figure (at least I doubt it).\n3. Seems like you still have a mom who is active in your life.\n\nI don\u2019t know what your father or step mother were expecting exactly.

You can't blame yourself for not knowing that.", "NTA Probably should apologize for laughing and have a serious talk about why that isn\u2019t your relationship", "My mom was in a long term relationship for about ten years. My parents divorced when I was 6 and I wasn't even that close with my dad after that. They weren't married but they did live the married lifestyle. They never once thought I should be calling him father and certainly never considered asking me too.", "NTA\n\nAs a stepmom, I can\u2019t imagine asking something like this. It\u2019s just insane. \n\nBut your dad is TA here because he could have spared her feelings by speaking to you privately. This could have gone much worse and I think a caught off guard laugh is really not your fault.", "NTA, especially being that April fools just happened.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nI genuinely do not comprehend this trend in stepparents believing that they magically become actual parents the moment they're married.

Just politely pass.", "NTA what the hell.", "Came here to say this. NTA. Unfortunately for your dad and step mom, the role of mom is already taken in your life. She\u2019s not your mom, she\u2019s your step mom. They shouldn\u2019t expect that of you.", "If OP was younger, had a closer relationship with the Stepmom, and, most crucially, wanted to start calling her \"mom,\" that wouldn't be so crazy. Having someone fill a role in your life doesn't necessarily mean that role has to be exclusive to them. The issue here isn't that OP already has a mom, it's that the stepmom had unrealistic expectations about how OP should view and treat her in their blended family.", "18 months is also not an especially long time in the scheme of things, particularly at your age, for this kind of development to be likely, but maybe that\u2019s just me \u2014 and I say this as a person with a first marriage, married to someone with a first marriage and a daughter from that marriage.", "I'm in my fifties. My stepmother has been one of the most important people in my life since I was twelve. My mother has been dead for three and a half years now, so there's nobody else in my life that I call Mom anymore. I *still* call my stepmother by her first name, and it would never have occurred to her to ask me to do otherwise. I do refer to her and my father collectively as \"my parents,\" because it's easier, but in herself, she's her first name. I love her to bits and we've always gotten along and been close -- it just wouldn't have ever crossed my mind. I had a mother. My stepmother is a wonderful woman and my third parent, but she's not my mother and she never was.", "This! Step has done nothing to earn the title of mom. Marrying someone father doesn't give you the right to be called mom. It is an insult to the woman who did all the hard work of raising OP.", "I thought it might've been a joke because I just thought it would be weird otherwise since I'm not very close with her. I'm hindsight I probably should've read the room better.", "Could you elaborate a bit?", "I would argue she isn\u2019t even a stepmom, since she never had a motherly role in OPs life. She is just her dads new wife but that\u2019s it.", "Since my kid has no living bio-dad and barely remembers him(he was addicted to opiates and many of her memories are not good), she was looking for a father figure. It was never forced on either of our parts, I have never asked her to call me one thing or another. I grew up with several step-parents, and was able to learn from the good and bad that they all did, and tried my best to always just treat her like I would my own biological child. I taught her to drive, bought her her first car, and plan to be there for her til I die even if my wife and I were to ever divorce.", "No you don't need to apology to your dad or stepmother  for their ridiculous request.  You are almost 18 years old and you already have a mother.  This woman has done absolutely nothing to deserve the title yet she and your father felt they had the right to ask. It is disrespectful to your actual mom who has done the work of raising you. NTA never apologize when someone makes a completely out of line and absurd request of you", "Yeah I'd say a genuine apology to stepmom might be a good idea, to try minimize long term hard feelings. She'll (hopefully) be happily married to your dad for the rest of their lives, so it's good to keep relations as good as possible, even if it's just for your dad's sake. Once you see it from her perspective I'm sure you can understand why she's sad over this.", "I\u2019m saying that laughing at somebody who seems to be attempting to connect with you is kind of cruel.", "Makes sense. The key is to let the kid set the pace. Some of them end up using the titles 'Mom' or 'Dad.' Most don't. Some use first names, others come up with their own nicknames for the parent -- my kids call their stepmother something that my son came up with for her as a baby, and everyone thought it was cool so they went with it to this day. So long as the kids get to decide what feels right to them, it doesn't much matter what they decide.", "You don't connect with your step-child by one-sidedly telling them to call you \"mom\", you just don't. \n\nNow we consider relevant factors:  \n_OP is almost an adult.  \n_The stepmother has been around for only 1.5 years.  \n_OP's mom is still alive and present.   \n_Most importantly, OP and the stepmother are not close at all.   \nOP laughing at their ridiculous suggestion is the most understandable and foreseeable response. Genuine reaction to ridiculousness does not make one an AH.", "Sounds more like an attempt to control, not connect.", "That's what I assumed you were saying.
