The third incident was this small little fluff of a dog who got out all the time. I knew how it'd go if the dog got too close, and I was putting my dog at risk of being put down. (For the record my dog wasn't aggressive, but she was a loyal girl and wasn't going to play nice with this stupid fluff.) So I picked up my 85lb dog from this little 10 pound dog. The owners were super casually walking towards us, but still quite far. I was pushing the dog off of me with my foot (not kicking) and they yelled at me for kicking their dog.

She was walking two dogs and had headphones on and didn't realize she had dropped the leash of one of them when she was picking up some poop. My bully, like your dog, is dog reactive because he was attacked by another dog when he was younger.

But since she's kooky and she was apologetic I just let it go. \n\nBut I have checked my local laws. If a 5 lb Chihuahua comes up to my dog off leash, my dog is not responsible for what happens. End of story. If it's legal where you live and you feel comfortable, you might want to consider carrying mace or pepper spray with you. I do but I don't spray the dog unless it gets within a few feet. Only had to do it a couple times.

Next time this happens to me I'm going to yell \"He's got parvo\" and watch them run. \ud83d\ude0f", "honestly if my brother had a muzzle i would\u2019ve used one, he only had the head harness thing (that stops pulling) since bear is 9/10 pretty calm and just pulls a little at the start of his walks. and the hug was because he\u2019s a big cuddler so i thought it might put him at ease a tad bit. \n\nbut yeah i couldve definitely handled it better ill admit, ive just never been there when something like this has happened before but ill definitely do better if there\u2019s ever a next time!", "The other owner couldn\u2019t control their dog because it was off leash so how is OP at any fault? If the other owner was following regulations none of this would have happened, which is why leash rules were made in the first place.", "His dog was pretty damn good. It seems well-trained.", "He's not such a threat.\n\nOnly to off leash dogs jumping on people, and that's why they walk in an area where you have to leash your dog. OP is NTA", "The woman was a solid 100% in the wrong by refusing to have her dog on a leash, and doubling down when she was told exactly that. If anything had happened to either animal, it would be on her.", "weirdly enough, that is the \u201cless chance route\u201d since most people follow the rules and have their dogs leashed, and the other route is near a dog park (which we obviously avoid for everyone\u2019s benefit) but it might be time to find a new route if we can. thanks for the feedback!", "OP already said that the dog behaves well when other owners are following regulations and keeping their dog on leashes. A muzzle is not necessary if people keep their dogs on leashes like they are supposed to. OP is NTA and shouldn\u2019t have to go to unnecessary steps because of other\u2019s incompetence and disregard of regulations.", "honestly i was so baffled that she was so calm when bear was acting how he was. like he\u2019s a *big dog*, he\u2019s almost 6ft when he stands on his back legs and his head matches his body. if id had less control over him or if her dog got too close to his face it would have ended horribly.", "honestly i kinda wish i had been more assertive with the dog, but hindsight is 20/20", "honestly im not particularly a dog person, dont get me wrong i love them but they can be a handful and i know my limits are more on the \u201ccan pick up with one hand\u201d side of animals, but even with that i know how to handle a dog for the most part. bear isnt my dog full time and ive never been there when an off leash dog is nearby so i definitely couldve handled it better but my only thought was \u201cdo whatever you can to stop this going horribly wrong\u201d. it just really irked me that i seemed to care more about her dog\u2019s safety than she did", "honestly my heart broke a little once her dog was out of that situation, he was whining and kept licking my face like he was trying to check if i was hurt. \n\nhe\u2019s usually a big softie, and once you tell him to sit he\u2019ll ignore leashed dogs for the most part, but he was obviously scared id get hurt", "Right the \u2018he\u2019s harmless\u2019 comment really pissed me off, like okay? Good for him but my dog isn\u2019t harmless. There are two dogs in this situation, not just yours.", "Sorry that happened to you.  Uneducated, stupid, careless dog owners drive me crazy.", "Exactly, just try not to panic in these situations. I was reading down the thread and saw that someone else was talking about heading to places where not many other dogs would be. I don't know where you're from but in the UK they have fields you can rent for like an hour cheaply. See if there's anywhere near your area that can supply this. \n\nBut yeah just a heads up dogs are smart af, if you're shouting / acting defensive, they will smell that you're scared and quite literally protect you. So just try stay calm, invest in a muzzle or let your brother know he should. I am sure after experiencing this though this time you will be able to handle it better the next time this happens. (Even though you can't quite literally control other people's dogs) Just try your best to avoid the situation and *stay calm.*", "I don't think leash walking is regulated in most places, theirs no rules to say you can keep your dog on the leash or off in most places. Also, as stated I was aiding advise and not necessarily saying the OP was incorrect.", "According to OP the dog would be capable of killing the other dog if the dog got too close. That's not a pretty damn good well-trained dog.\n\nFor instance, in my country it is mandatory for big dogs (and some smaller dogs of specific breeds) to use a muzzle exactly because it doesn't matter how well-trained they are, if they decide to bite then can do real harm. OP knows the dog can be unstable in certain situations and he knows he can actually kill a dog. the dog should have been wearing a muzzle.\n\nForget about an incorrectly unleashed dog, it could have been a stray dog. Or the dog could have felt a person was threatening OP and bitten them (OP says the issue with the dog is its over-protectiveness of the owner's well-being). So yeah, a dog like this should always be a muzzle when out in public.", "It could have been a stray dog passing by.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "My dog isn\u2019t even not harmless just super scared! Like don\u2019t bother my dog he\u2019s obviously terrified", "The dog's owner got multiple citations for no collar/leash, no tags (they were still at the vet's) and other things involving their other dogs and their outstanding warrants.\n\nIf only they had kept the front gate closed.\n\nIt was a gory, but not bad enough to need stitches kind of wound.", "Most cities have regulations to keep your dog on leash. OP doesn\u2019t need advice because they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. The other dog owner was inconsiderate and clueless and deserved everything that was said.", "if a dog passes by he\u2019s good at ignoring it or pulling maybe once if he\u2019s curious. we walked past a lot of dogs this weekend and he was fine with all of them once he was told to sit. \n\nobviously anything can happen at any time, but when he\u2019s put in \u201csit and stay\u201d he\u2019s really good at ignoring distractions, its just off leash dogs that get him worked up like this, which is why we specifically walk him in an area where dogs have to be on leash. \n\nbut he is a big dog, he\u2019s just shy of 6ft tall when on his back legs and he weighs over 100lbs. if something had gone wrong, he could have seriously hurt the other dog and the woman seemed to not realise this. if you want a better point of reference, [heres a pinterest photo](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/424745808583275631/) of a similar dog on their back legs.", "OP was responsible by having his own dog on a leash like he is supposed to. He did nothing wrong. \n\nAnd I mean, you're also replying to me, because this is a forum where we can do that freely.", "There is a difference between aggressive and reactive. The other dog was aggressive. He was actively coming after another dog and a person. Bear is reactive. He was not going after the other dog until the other dog threatened him and his person. You should not have to alter your behavior in anticipation of other people breaking the law.", "we live in a city in the UK and i dont drive (public transport is pretty good here) so there aren\u2019t really any dirt roads nearby, or at least near enough to walk there and back", "Well. That \u201cfind a dead end dirt road\u201d comment sounds ominous AF. WTF", "Who pissed in your coffee then", "That's precisely my point, if the dog decides to do harm he can do a lot of harm. That's why he should be on a muzzle.\n\nYou could have passed by a stray dog, which would obviously not be on a leash. Or a dog on a leash but whose owner gives them free rein and would get too close too fast.", "[removed]", "I think you are very responsible with this dog. Ignore this person.", "And I'm sorry your basic understanding of common rules like \"dogs must be on a leash\" are so poor. Must be hard for you to follow basic instructions."]}
