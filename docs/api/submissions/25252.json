I took that step years ago with a reactive rescue dog whose behaviours sound similar to Bear's.

The third incident was this small little fluff of a dog who got out all the time. I knew how it'd go if the dog got too close, and I was putting my dog at risk of being put down. (For the record my dog wasn't aggressive, but she was a loyal girl and wasn't going to play nice with this stupid fluff.) So I picked up my 85lb dog from this little 10 pound dog. The owners were super casually walking towards us, but still quite far. I was pushing the dog off of me with my foot (not kicking) and they yelled at me for kicking their dog.

She was walking two dogs and had headphones on and didn't realize she had dropped the leash of one of them when she was picking up some poop. My bully, like your dog, is dog reactive because he was attacked by another dog when he was younger.

But since she's kooky and she was apologetic I just let it go. \n\nBut I have checked my local laws. If a 5 lb Chihuahua comes up to my dog off leash, my dog is not responsible for what happens. End of story. If it's legal where you live and you feel comfortable, you might want to consider carrying mace or pepper spray with you. I do but I don't spray the dog unless it gets within a few feet. Only had to do it a couple times. The police got called out once and the police told the other person flat out \"Would you prefer she mace your dog or her dog tear yours to pieces? The only one who did something wrong here was you!\" Be familiar with the laws in your area but don't be afraid to yell if it's necessary.

In the 5 steps it took him to be within a hands distance from my dog I said \u201cdo not pet him he will bite you\u201d.

Any animal, any time, she was ready to throw down. \n\nHer insanity with other animals was a running joke in my friend group, I say ALL of that to say that more than once, a few friends came to me saying basically that the sun shines out of their dogs ass, and oh boy oh boy they would get along so well, their dog had that special sauce that would somehow cure years and years of consistent behavior.

And you never know when your perfectly well behaved harmless dog will suddenly decide they hate another dog or another person. Growing up there was a golden retriever who lived across the street from us, very friendly, very well behaved, got along with our dogs and other dogs in the neighborhood, then he suddenly decided he hated my boxer and would charge as fast as he could into our yard to attack him, out of no where. My poor boy wouldn\u2019t defend himself or fight back, he was so confused about his friend suddenly attacking him.

You are dead right on this. Leash laws exist for a reason, and not everyone wants to be BFFs with your dog.

One time I was in the passenger seat of my truck, waiting for my partner to get off work, and my German Shepherd was laying in the backseat.

My dad told him to back off and keep walking or it would be his dog needing medical attention. The idiot dropped the leash, took off the muzzle and said go. Dad didn't have time to grab the cat and the dog ended up needing a few grands worth (back in the 60s-70s) of emergency care at the vets. Cat was completely fine, just needed a bath which ended up with dad needing help dis infecting his scratched  hands.\n\nCats can be vicious.", "I think to be honest there is something both of you needed to account for in this situation. Yes, she should have leashed her dog and had it on leash at all times in a leashed area and she was in the wrong. However, if you have a reactive dog that poses a real danger to another dogs life it should be muzzled in public. \n\nNot a popular opinion but even the best behaved dog will have a moment where it will do something where an owner doesn't have 100% control but that is the nature of a living breathing creature. \n\nFor example when mine was a puppy i was unaware that several retractable leads are not made for any sort of wear and tear and when mine rubbed against a wall the lead broke and my puppy was running free. I did not intend for him to be off lead while we worked on recall but there wasn't much i could do except try to catch him as quickly as i could. Unfortunately at that moment a women with a reactive big dog came around the corner and she was shouting at me to get my dog. Honestly, i was trying my best i was running my ass off trying treats, distractions and trying to grab him, anything i could but there was nothing else i could have been doing to sort it out. \n\nIn her mind i was that irresponsible dog owner who couldn't control their off lead dog but as he was a 3/4 month old puppy there was a limit on how well our recall worked and the lead had snapped. I learned my lesson and retractable leads are no longer used for my dog. \n\nAt the end of the day a dog should it attack a person or dog it will be the owner who is prosecuted and the dog deemed dangerous. Therefore, if you can mitigate any risk for yourself and your dog such as a muzzle when in public then its best to do so. Plan for the worst basically.", "Roflmao, love it, and they sure can be!\n\nFunny thing about the \"rottie mix\" incident, before that my mom talked about getting a dog for security because we were two women living (and camping) alone and she was worried about our safety.\n\nAfter?!

That's all.", "Because that's a smart dog, who knows that wee-bitty kitty could part his fur crosswise and chase him for a country mile. I've seen it happen, many times.\nI mean, there's videos of housecats taking on BEARS and chasing them away. Anything that'll take on a bear isn't something a sensible person wants to tangle with, amirite?!", "I can't remember if the wannabe gangsters dog was an German Sheppard of a Doberman.  Dad has told a couple of stories about that cat getting into mischief. \n\nIt's brother was deaf AF and dads cat would jump up on top of the water heater, wait for his bro to come around the corner then drop down on his bro and scar the shit out of him.", "Yeah, that's a cat for ya! \n\nAnd thank you!
