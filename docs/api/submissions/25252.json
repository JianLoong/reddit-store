I took that step years ago with a reactive rescue dog whose behaviours sound similar to Bear's.

The third incident was this small little fluff of a dog who got out all the time. I knew how it'd go if the dog got too close, and I was putting my dog at risk of being put down. (For the record my dog wasn't aggressive, but she was a loyal girl and wasn't going to play nice with this stupid fluff.) So I picked up my 85lb dog from this little 10 pound dog. The owners were super casually walking towards us, but still quite far. I was pushing the dog off of me with my foot (not kicking) and they yelled at me for kicking their dog.

And the argument that your dog shouldn't be in public if he's reactive is horseshit, because why should his quality of life be diminished?

She was walking two dogs and had headphones on and didn't realize she had dropped the leash of one of them when she was picking up some poop. My bully, like your dog, is dog reactive because he was attacked by another dog when he was younger.

But since she's kooky and she was apologetic I just let it go. \n\nBut I have checked my local laws. If a 5 lb Chihuahua comes up to my dog off leash, my dog is not responsible for what happens. End of story. If it's legal where you live and you feel comfortable, you might want to consider carrying mace or pepper spray with you. I do but I don't spray the dog unless it gets within a few feet. Only had to do it a couple times. The police got called out once and the police told the other person flat out \"Would you prefer she mace your dog or her dog tear yours to pieces? The only one who did something wrong here was you!\" Be familiar with the laws in your area but don't be afraid to yell if it's necessary.
