{"id": 18322, "submission_id": "13thw37", "title": "AITA for refusing to resell my Taylor Swift Tickets", "selftext": "Hello, long time lurker and first time poster. I (26F) have been a Taylor Swift fan since middle school. I say she\u2019s gotten me through some pretty rough times. One example is when my neglectful family banned me to my room for a full year with no tv, or any entertainment at all. I secretly kept one of those tiny iPods and all it had on it was her debut album. I listened to it over, and over, and over\u2026 it was all I had. My speaker was some weird toy I got for Xmas one year\u2026. It was a stuffed elephant with a little aux cord and tiny speaker on its rear. Never used it until that moment. I\u2019d say from then on I\u2019ve heard every song, purchased every album, and still listen to her daily. \n\nWhen she announced her Eras Tour I was so excited. I was going to try my best to get tickets. I did the verified fan, fought 2000+ swifties in the Ticketmaster queue, and somehow left with 2 tickets in the nosebleeds for $155 each on 8/5 in SoFi stadium. At the moment I was completely broke, so I had to ask my boyfriend if I could borrow his Amex card to pay for them. He said no numerous times, I think until I had tears in my eyes and had to beg how much it would mean to me. And of course, how I promise to pay him back. He said I had to get the cheapest tickets, but that didn\u2019t matter to me. Just being there was my goal. \n\nFast forward to now, tickets are reselling for $2.5k each in the section we are in. He expects me to sell them. I tell him no way. He has been calling me selfish and that I care more about some rich person more that my family (him[27] son[6]). He is arguing that there is no person in the world he would see for $5k. I say I didn\u2019t pay $5k I paid $155 (completely paid him back btw) and the memories mean more to me than that money ever could. He argues I should\u2019ve known they were going to be a hot item and bought more seats for the sole purpose of reselling. I just say I didn\u2019t buy them to resell, I bought them to go see my favorite artist. He just keeps listing the stuff we could pay off: my car or his student debt. Or the vacations we can take instead: Vegas, Disneyland. I just can\u2019t give them up. Am I being irrational by not reselling them? AITA?\n\nTldr: Taylor swift tickets I bought for $155 now reselling for $2.5k each. Boyfriend expects me to sell them. I have been a huge fan of hers for forever and don\u2019t want to miss this tour.", "created_utc": 1685220744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13thw37/aita_for_refusing_to_resell_my_taylor_swift/", "score": 3243, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They were presented as an Xmas gift ( really, THE xmas gift!). My eldest is 15, and starting to look ahead to driving, getting car, etc. At one point I looked at resale prices and told her we could sell the tickets and realistically get enough for them to outright buy her a solid used car ( between 8-10K). She rejected the offer instantly, with a \"stop talking. not happening.\"\n\nAnd so I stopped talking, respected her choice, and moved on. Your bf should too. They are not his tickets. It is not his decision to make. Find a friend who will appreciate the experience and have a great time. I confess to really only knowing the top 40 Taylor songs before getting the tickets and being placed on a training plan by my kids rather than a true fan, but the entire experience was truly magical and memorable and worth all of the stress and drama of getting tickets, planning outfits, cramming lyrics, and fighting to escape the parking lot after the show. \n\nAnd start saving up now for your overpriced $75 hoodie as a keepsake so you're not in the position of needing a loan.

Also, most people I know who are still trying to get tickets to the tour are not paying those ridiculously high prices anyway, so you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to sell nosebleed tickets for 5k.", "NTA - you probably won't get $2.5k each for them anyway.

But if you guys are struggling to survive month to month, then you should be prioritizing needs over wants (especially with a child to consider).", "Tough one. I can see the logic from both sides. I'm going with NTA as the tickets were bought with the intention of seeing the gig so the current monetary value is irrelevant. However, I can understand if finances are tight there would be an allure to reselling. Can you attend yourself and sell the other ticket for 2.5k?", "NTA- music is an important coping skill and it gets people through the worst times in their lives. She did that for you and you should go. I\u2019ve heard the experience is really special for the fans who have special meaning to her music and you deserve to be seen and valued by others who feel the same way. \n\nThe boyfriend can kick rocks though, you deserve someone who values you for who you are.", "NTA.

Those are hot ticket items.", "NTA - personally, I'd be petty and sell his,  using the profits to buy merchandise at the concert.\n\nI did nothing but work for two decades and had no good memories to show for it. In my 40s, I've now realised that you need to take these once in a lifetime moments. Otherwise, you will have a lifetime of regret.", "Interesting how he's your family when he wants money from you but he's your boyfriend and not your fiance. He made you grovel. Sell his ticket, enjoy the show. NTA.", "So he wants the cash to go blow it in Vegas? Too  bad you already had a kid with this asshole.

Keep your tickets and enjoy the show.\n\n\nYour BF doesn\u2019t really sound like a keeper.", "NTA but maybe consider selling the second ticket and using the money to get the hell away from this jerk. Maybe he's not usually like that, but just from what you've written I see some pretty major red flags!", "ESH. You paid him back so you don't have to sell it.\n\nBut he also clearly didn't want to buy them and you basically nagged and cried at him until he said yes. Why is everyone ignoring this aspect of the story? Everyone is saying to dump the bf, but why should he stay with someone that is emotionally manipulating him?\n\nAlso, is the kid yours?", "N T A for refusing to sell,\n\nBut YTA for pressuring him into allowing you to use his card, to purchase the tickets.

Do you have ~$10k sitting around now in an emergency fund (outside of retirement)?\n\nIf not, then especially with a kid I would call you the asshole for prioritizing a concert over your family's financial security. Even 10k is on the low end. \n\nIf you do, then your son is taken care of, your bf should take care of his own loans, and you should go to the concert guilt free.", "NTA, but also not a good decision maker. If you actually could get yourself and your family into a better financial situation, then you should sell the tickets. This seems a bit immature and selfish to me when you can make a more responsible decision to support your family.", "[deleted]", "NAH, but it\u2019s pretty clear that you\u2019re awful with money. You didn\u2019t have the $155 in the first place even though you had months to save up. Now you\u2019re throwing away a huge money making opportunity.", "NTA, but I agree with your BF. I would sell the tickets to my favorite artist if I can get 5k. I can use the money help pay for things I need to.  He's an AH for saying to sell the tickets and help him pay off his debt. You put in the work to get them. He should not benefit from it.  Sell his ticket and Enjoy your time at the concert.", "YTA, once I re-read that you cried to get your way, id expect that behavior from his 6 year old son but a woman twenty years older than said boy? really?", "YTA, you manipulated him into letting you use his card. \n\nThe resale value on those tickets would have such an incredibly profound impact on both of your lives, and his son\u2019s, to a level you\u2019d never achieve by attending this concert. \n\nAlso your TL;DR is worded in a way which removes your mistakes from the situation, which is showing how you\u2019re trying to pass blame.", "Not agreeing with him, just explaining part of his viewpoint: there's a term called 'opportunity cost' which means 'what else you could buy with the value of that thing'. So while the cost per ticket is $155, the opportunity cost per ticket is indeed $2.5k\n\nNAH (except for your parents, wtf?), you both have valid viewpoints. To you the ticket is worth the opportunity cost, to him it's not. That's not greed, that's just preferring getting out of debt to seeing a concert that he's not as emotionally invested in as you are.\n\nIf you've paid him back then they are your tickets, so up to you whether you sell them. If he's the second ticket, then as others suggest perhaps a good compromise would be to sell his. However scalping also sucks, I know many people who wouldn't resell as a point of principle.  \n\nNot as simple a problem as it looks. Every answer sucks to some extent.

I don't want that for you. \n\nPlease take a hard look at this relationship, and then call up an old friend you haven't talked to in a long time. And then on Tuesday, when the banks open again, open up an account at a different bank or credit union. Not the one you have the joint account at. Make sure you sign up for electric statements, not paper. When you're back at work, change your direct deposit so that $50 or $100 a month goes into this new account, while the rest continues to go into the joint account. It will add up over time, and then you'll feel a little more freedom.", "Make sure you hide those tickets somewhere untouchable by him... I wouldn't for a second put it past him to sneak them away from you and sell them. Get a safety deposit box for a couple of months... don't let anything happen to your tickets. I'd hate to have your dreams shattered... I think life has been hard enough on you!", "Same same", "Glad to see someone with sense. I'd be just as pissed as the BF in this case.. no artist is worth missing out on 5k (if you're in a financial position where 5k is alot of money).", "Yes, god forbid someone who is struggling or poor find any joy in life. She should suffer all the time! Only the rich deserve to enjoy things!\n\n/s btw", "HER kid is not her responsibility? Since when?", "I've had plenty of nice conversations with people, and I'm neither hot nor a chick. And I'd imagine if I was a bit more outgoing, I'd have more of those stories.", "I have a bank account that has my direct deposit for my work checks. I pay my bills and whatever money I have left goes to the savings which he has in his bank account. We split bills 50/50", "I sure didn't say that!  \n\nBut hope you enjoyed putting me in my place.\n\n/s btw", "I responded to that in a different comment. I misunderstood and misread thinking that HE HAD a child that he brought into their relationship, I reread it and realize that it is their child together and have since clarified.", "Selling nosebleed seats for $2500 just to profit absolutely is AH behavior.", "I really hope Taylor Swift uses something other than Ticketmaster for her next concert.", "For limited ticket events like this, they would easily go up in value just by nature of people getting desperate for the tickets. Scalpers drove it up higher but they'd still appreciate in value regardless", "Does he get annoyed when you want to spend money on things for yourself?\n\nIf it's generally yes, then his behavior would be concerning.\n\nIf not and this kind of conflict is unusual...then he may have some concerns of his own.", "Can you access his bank account where your money goes after bills? Do you have access to it?", "To clarify, is that savings account a joint account with your name in it? If not, you should have a join account where you both have equal access. Other thoughts, compromise, and sell his ticket and go enjoy the show without anyone souring it. My friend went by herself and had the best time with the show. You deserve joy in your life. Many folks who want to enjoy a show can't now because of resale prices pricing out so many folks.", "It's hers and his.", "It certainly does come across that way.", "I commented in this about this. When I was working as a substitute teacher, still needed food stamps.", "If that's the going price for them then I don't see it that way. Chuck them on an online auction at $1 reserve and see what happens. Donate the excess to whatever charity you like if you feel badly that someone wants to go and spend the equivalent of a month's rent on a concert ticket. \n\n  Where I live you can't even resell event tickets most of the time, you have to sell them back to the vendor at cost and hope someone buys them.", "You\u2019d be surprised how many folks who work still get food stamps. I worked for a school district in OC.  My food stamp case manager said \u201coh we have plenty of reciepents working for (school district ). Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nIt absolutely worried me as this was a substitute teacher position making decent money .", "The boyfriend literally suggested she pay off his student loan but also gave her a hard time for asking to borrow the credit card, told her to get cheap tickets, and is now gas lighting her saying she should have bought more tickets. I don\u2019t think this boyfriend is going to let her keep this money if she sells, he seems abusive.\n\nShe should sell and use it to get away from this asshole tho.  \n\nNTA but also keep you and your kid safe if this is an opportunity to do that.", "Because these numbers are a fantasy. She has face value tickets, supposedly nose bleed seats yes they are going for a lot on resale but not thousands. This is absurd.", "Yes, but isn't that a reflection that even though you were working, you were still in a financially precarious position?", "I\u2019m on food stamps and if I had the chance to make 3,000 for my family and my kid.. I would feel guilty not taking it and spending it on 3 hours of seeing Taylor swift", "So much this!! If I had awards to give, I would give you one. The Judgy McJudgersons in this thread really come off as making it seem like poverty is a moral failure instead of a financial circumstance. OP borrowed the money and paid it back. The potential value of a resale (and it's no guarantee, even for a Swifty ticket that she'd actually get that money or that the process wouldn't be fraught). OP not choosing to go wouldn't have made their financial situation any better. \n\nThe idea that she's not allowed to do anything to prioritize her own happiness once she became a parent is how we get horror stories of parents who resent their children and children who grow up expecting everyone around them to set themselves on fire to make them comfortable because they never learned they weren't the center of the universe.\n\nOP, don't take the boyfriend. Sell the extra ticket or take your kid (who might have fun at a music concert and make a precious memory with you and would definitely appreciate it more than your bf). This is obviously important to your emotional well-being and you are allowed to honor that.", "Thank you! All these posts berating OP and calling her a bad mother because she wants one night to herself to have a good time and listen to music that has gotten her through rough times is ridiculous. She is human. Yes, she is a mother and I am sure she will do everything she can for her child, but being a mom is not her only identity. \n\nI think is as women can get so caught up in the mom identity and doing everything for our children. Sacrificing ourself. Even to the detriment of our own well-being. However, our children won\u2019t thrive unless we give ourselves the time to thrive and remember that women are more than just the label of a mom.\n\nAs far as we know this concert is one night to enjoy herself as an adult. It\u2019s not necessarily a pattern of putting her wants constantly in front of the wellbeing of her family and child. People who are poor, in debt, use government assistance, and/or single moms, etc also deserve to have fun once in a while. We\u2019re human and we all deserve kindness and something to bring us joy. It\u2019s a concert that she has already paid back her boyfriend for the tickets.\n\nIt\u2019s fine. Let her go and enjoy the damn concert people lol.\n\nNTA", "He suggested paying off her car or his student loan.  They are a couple raising a child.  Making joint decisions is common practice.", "I suppose ?  I\u2019m in hospital right now recovering from my first surgery. Don\u2019t have a brain atm to talk about financial situations. It was just an example that even teachers are on food stamps .", "I totally get that.  My specific issue here is that OP has a child that she has apparently struggled to provide with food in the very recent past. Splurging on yourself when it means you going without is no one's business but your own, but splurging when you're living on the edge of not being able to provide for your kid is not okay.", ">also something is really wrong if this kind of money would immediately go to a vacation (per her SO) and not bills or essentials.\n\nOP literally mentioned her SO talking about how it could be used for paying off debt. \n\nI think the mention of vacation is that if she is so insistent on the importance of experiences, with $5k they could easily pay for the whole family to go to Disneyland for a few days and still pay some bills considering they presumably live in/near LA with the plan to go to Sofi Stadium.\n\nSo essentially her SO's point seems to be that if they sold the tickets they could pay bills and still not skip out on having a great time, it just wouldn't be at a Taylor Swift concert. That's not really a crazy idea. \n\nThe insinuation that OP should have bought tickets just for reselling is insane though, especially when she was barely able to buy the original tickets.", "Poor people are allowed to enjoy things too. Y'all's judgement of her is really telling.", "*Substitute* teachers. \n\nLicensed contract teachers make exponentially more than substitute teachers.", "yeah that's what changes it for me. If you want to spend money you don't have on something nice for yourself, have at it...as long as a kid isn't going without because of your choice to splurge", "This is such an empathetic response. Really refreshing and nice to read that. You sound like a lovely person.", "All this while she's asking about food stamps, too. Neither of them have good money management skills."]}
