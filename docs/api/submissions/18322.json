{"id": 18322, "submission_id": "13thw37", "title": "AITA for refusing to resell my Taylor Swift Tickets", "selftext": "Hello, long time lurker and first time poster. I (26F) have been a Taylor Swift fan since middle school. I say she\u2019s gotten me through some pretty rough times. One example is when my neglectful family banned me to my room for a full year with no tv, or any entertainment at all. I secretly kept one of those tiny iPods and all it had on it was her debut album. I listened to it over, and over, and over\u2026 it was all I had. My speaker was some weird toy I got for Xmas one year\u2026. It was a stuffed elephant with a little aux cord and tiny speaker on its rear. Never used it until that moment. I\u2019d say from then on I\u2019ve heard every song, purchased every album, and still listen to her daily. \n\nWhen she announced her Eras Tour I was so excited. I was going to try my best to get tickets. I did the verified fan, fought 2000+ swifties in the Ticketmaster queue, and somehow left with 2 tickets in the nosebleeds for $155 each on 8/5 in SoFi stadium. At the moment I was completely broke, so I had to ask my boyfriend if I could borrow his Amex card to pay for them. He said no numerous times, I think until I had tears in my eyes and had to beg how much it would mean to me. And of course, how I promise to pay him back. He said I had to get the cheapest tickets, but that didn\u2019t matter to me. Just being there was my goal. \n\nFast forward to now, tickets are reselling for $2.5k each in the section we are in. He expects me to sell them. I tell him no way. He has been calling me selfish and that I care more about some rich person more that my family (him[27] son[6]). He is arguing that there is no person in the world he would see for $5k. I say I didn\u2019t pay $5k I paid $155 (completely paid him back btw) and the memories mean more to me than that money ever could. He argues I should\u2019ve known they were going to be a hot item and bought more seats for the sole purpose of reselling. I just say I didn\u2019t buy them to resell, I bought them to go see my favorite artist. He just keeps listing the stuff we could pay off: my car or his student debt. Or the vacations we can take instead: Vegas, Disneyland. I just can\u2019t give them up. Am I being irrational by not reselling them? AITA?\n\nTldr: Taylor swift tickets I bought for $155 now reselling for $2.5k each. Boyfriend expects me to sell them. I have been a huge fan of hers for forever and don\u2019t want to miss this tour.", "created_utc": 1685220744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13thw37/aita_for_refusing_to_resell_my_taylor_swift/", "score": 507, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They were presented as an Xmas gift ( really, THE xmas gift!). My eldest is 15, and starting to look ahead to driving, getting car, etc. At one point I looked at resale prices and told her we could sell the tickets and realistically get enough for them to outright buy her a solid used car ( between 8-10K). She rejected the offer instantly, with a \"stop talking. not happening.\"\n\nAnd so I stopped talking, respected her choice, and moved on. Your bf should too. They are not his tickets. It is not his decision to make. Find a friend who will appreciate the experience and have a great time. I confess to really only knowing the top 40 Taylor songs before getting the tickets and being placed on a training plan by my kids rather than a true fan, but the entire experience was truly magical and memorable and worth all of the stress and drama of getting tickets, planning outfits, cramming lyrics, and fighting to escape the parking lot after the show. \n\nAnd start saving up now for your overpriced $75 hoodie as a keepsake so you're not in the position of needing a loan.

Also, most people I know who are still trying to get tickets to the tour are not paying those ridiculously high prices anyway, so you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to sell nosebleed tickets for 5k.", "NTA - you probably won't get $2.5k each for them anyway.

I'm going with NTA as the tickets were bought with the intention of seeing the gig so the current monetary value is irrelevant. However, I can understand if finances are tight there would be an allure to reselling. Can you attend yourself and sell the other ticket for 2.5k?", "NTA- music is an important coping skill and it gets people through the worst times in their lives. She did that for you and you should go. I\u2019ve heard the experience is really special for the fans who have special meaning to her music and you deserve to be seen and valued by others who feel the same way. \n\nThe boyfriend can kick rocks though, you deserve someone who values you for who you are.", "NTA.

In my 40s, I've now realised that you need to take these once in a lifetime moments. Otherwise, you will have a lifetime of regret.", "Interesting how he's your family when he wants money from you but he's your boyfriend and not your fiance. He made you grovel. Sell his ticket, enjoy the show. NTA.", "So he wants the cash to go blow it in Vegas? Too  bad you already had a kid with this asshole.

Keep your tickets and enjoy the show.\n\n\nYour BF doesn\u2019t really sound like a keeper.", "NTA but maybe consider selling the second ticket and using the money to get the hell away from this jerk. Maybe he's not usually like that, but just from what you've written I see some pretty major red flags!", "ESH. You paid him back so you don't have to sell it.\n\nBut he also clearly didn't want to buy them and you basically nagged him until he said yes. I don't know why everyone is ignoring this aspect of the story\n\nAlso, is the kid also yours?", "N T A for refusing to sell,\n\nBut YTA for pressuring him into allowing you to use his card, to purchase the tickets.

Do you have ~$10k sitting around now in an emergency fund (outside of retirement)?\n\nIf not, then especially with a kid I would call you the asshole for prioritizing a concert over your family's financial security. Even 10k is on the low end. \n\nIf you do, then your son is taken care of, your bf should take care of his own loans, and you should go to the concert guilt free.", "NTA, but also not a good decision maker. If you actually could get yourself and your family into a better financial situation, then you should sell the tickets. This seems a bit immature and selfish to me when you can make a more responsible decision to support your family.", "NAH. When your son is on the free breakfast/lunch program there's probably much better uses for your money than seeing a concert that you won't remember in a year.\n\nHowever, it's your ticket and your boyfriend can't make you sell them.\n\nWhy not sell one of the tickets and go alone as a compromise?", "NAH, but it\u2019s pretty clear that you\u2019re awful with money. You didn\u2019t have the $155 in the first place even though you had months to save up. Now you\u2019re throwing away a huge money making opportunity.", "NTA, but I agree with your BF. I would sell the tickets to my favorite artist if I can get 5k. I can use the money help pay for things I need to.  He's an AH for saying to sell the tickets and help him pay off his debt. You put in the work to get them. He should not benefit from it.  Sell his ticket and Enjoy your time at the concert.", "YTA, once I re-read that you cried to get your way, id expect that behavior from his 6 year old son but a woman twenty years older than said boy? really?", "YTA, you manipulated him into letting you use his card. \n\nThe resale value on those tickets would have such an incredibly profound impact on both of your lives, and his son\u2019s, to a level you\u2019d never achieve by attending this concert. \n\nAlso your TL;DR is worded in a way which removes your mistakes from the situation, which is showing how you\u2019re trying to pass blame.", "Not agreeing with him, just explaining part of his viewpoint: there's a term called 'opportunity cost' which means 'what else you could buy with the value of that thing'. So while the cost per ticket is $155, the opportunity cost per ticket is indeed $2.5k\n\nNAH (except for your parents, wtf?), you both have valid viewpoints. To you the ticket is worth the opportunity cost, to him it's not. That's not greed, that's just preferring getting out of debt to seeing a concert that he's not as emotionally invested in as you are.\n\nIf you've paid him back then they are your tickets, so up to you whether you sell them. If he's the second ticket, then as others suggest perhaps a good compromise would be to sell his. However scalping also sucks, I know many people who wouldn't resell as a point of principle.  \n\nNot as simple a problem as it looks. Every answer sucks to some extent.
