I am the only person in my house that pays bills and has any income.\n\nI(27M) am currently living with my fiancee \"Amy\"(24F) and have been for about threeish years. We have lived at our current residence for about two years. Quite a few months ago someone dumped a cat at our townhouse complex, I took one look and instantly fell in love. So naturally I started to feed it and have been doing so for about 8 months now. I was determined to get it's trust and take it in. About a month ago I got to the point where I can finally pet, touch, and hold the cat. And the cat finally doesn't run away from me. I bought the cat a shelter for the winter and plan on getting flea meds next month.\n\nRecently Amy has stated she wants us to move somewhere else, which is fine with me but of course it's going to take time to save. Which didn't make her happy as she wanted to move literally now if she could. She told me she doesn't want me to take the cat with me, and she wants me to leave the cat there.(because she wants a quick fix of moving to her parents) She said that she doesn't want me taking the cat to the vet or getting him fixed or any flea meds. For the record right now we have two bedrooms, I have an elderly indoor cat and I also own a rabbit. We have comfortable living space and she wants all of us to cram in trailer with her parents. My animals and I need more room than that.\n\nToo be honest it seems to me that she just wants more money for herself because she told me that I \"need to focus on taking care of my family and not taking in random cats\" and she said \"it's not your cat it's a stray\" and lets not forget \"that cat isn't part of the family\" (which made my blood boil by the way) I've been waiting for months for her to apply for disability benefits. We live a comfortable life even though it's just my income. We aren't struggling the only thing I'm struggling to do is put back as much money as I want because she really knows how to spend money. Anytime I tell her not to dip into a certain amount of money she finds a way to spend it.\n\nI'm not sure how much respect I have for her as a person if she expects me to just abandon a cat I've put 8 months of work into,(she tried to say if we just leave the cat here its not abandoning) trying to gain it's trust. She's telling me I'm biting off more than I can chew when I always pay bills early and my animals are healthy and spoiled and tbh she's spoiled too.\n\nETA: we have no children.

But for me this is close to E S H.\n\nGenerally it is not ok to bring a pet into a household without your partner being on board. As you already have pets, I think there is potential validity in questioning whether you have the resources, space, time, etc. to dedicate to another pet. But I realize you didn't exactly seek out this situation. It would have been better if you'd been able to trap the cat early on and get it to a shelter to be habilitated and hopefully adopted, but IDK if that is viable in your area. People who feed stray cats invite problems if they don't or can't continue feeding the stray as the stray is dependent. So the cat is effectively yours at this point. \n\nYour GF is TA for deciding unilaterally that you guys should move, and for having her preferred place be someplace she knows won't accommodate you, and for wanting to force, manipulate, or guilt you into giving up your pets. Obviously there are better ways that she should have approached this conversation and I think her behavior is enough to make you question the relationship.
