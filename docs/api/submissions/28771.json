I am the only person in my house that pays bills and has any income.\n\nI(27M) am currently living with my fiancee \"Amy\"(24F) and have been for about threeish years. We have lived at our current residence for about two years. Quite a few months ago someone dumped a cat at our townhouse complex, I took one look and instantly fell in love. So naturally I started to feed it and have been doing so for about 8 months now. I was determined to get it's trust and take it in. About a month ago I got to the point where I can finally pet, touch, and hold the cat. And the cat finally doesn't run away from me. I bought the cat a shelter for the winter and plan on getting flea meds next month.\n\nRecently Amy has stated she wants us to move somewhere else, which is fine with me but of course it's going to take time to save. Which didn't make her happy as she wanted to move literally now if she could. She told me she doesn't want me to take the cat with me, and she wants me to leave the cat there.(because she wants a quick fix of moving to her parents) She said that she doesn't want me taking the cat to the vet or getting him fixed or any flea meds. For the record right now we have two bedrooms, I have an elderly indoor cat and I also own a rabbit. We have comfortable living space and she wants all of us to cram in trailer with her parents. My animals and I need more room than that.\n\nToo be honest it seems to me that she just wants more money for herself because she told me that I \"need to focus on taking care of my family and not taking in random cats\" and she said \"it's not your cat it's a stray\" and lets not forget \"that cat isn't part of the family\" (which made my blood boil by the way) I've been waiting for months for her to apply for disability benefits. We live a comfortable life even though it's just my income. We aren't struggling the only thing I'm struggling to do is put back as much money as I want because she really knows how to spend money. Anytime I tell her not to dip into a certain amount of money she finds a way to spend it.\n\nI'm not sure how much respect I have for her as a person if she expects me to just abandon a cat I've put 8 months of work into,(she tried to say if we just leave the cat here its not abandoning) trying to gain it's trust. She's telling me I'm biting off more than I can chew when I always pay bills early and my animals are healthy and spoiled and tbh she's spoiled too.\n\nETA: we have no children.

But for me this is close to E S H.\n\nGenerally it is not ok to bring a pet into a household without your partner being on board. As you already have pets, I think there is potential validity in questioning whether you have the resources, space, time, etc. to dedicate to another pet. But I realize you didn't exactly seek out this situation. It would have been better if you'd been able to trap the cat early on and get it to a shelter to be habilitated and hopefully adopted, but IDK if that is viable in your area. People who feed stray cats invite problems if they don't or can't continue feeding the stray as the stray is dependent. So the cat is effectively yours at this point. \n\nYour GF is TA for deciding unilaterally that you guys should move, and for having her preferred place be someplace she knows won't accommodate you, and for wanting to force, manipulate, or guilt you into giving up your pets. Obviously there are better ways that she should have approached this conversation and I think her behavior is enough to make you question the relationship. But she may also consider it a dealbreaker to be with someone who takes on pets they aren't totally equipped to care for.", "ESH. Amy is the bigger AH in this situation. But it's not cool to adopt an animal, even in a sort of roundabout way, without consulting your partner if they're living with you. Even if you have pets already.  \n\n\nI do not understand why you would want to be in a relationship with someone who you don't respect. You say you're not sure, but the lack of respect for her (albeit deserved) is written all over your post. So, get a mediator and have a serious discussion about how you handle finances as a couple.

Also cats are family members.", "NTA - Look, if she had clear valid reasons for wanting to move in such a rush, there could be an argument for not taking the cat with you, especially given the cat is still semi feral and living outside.  Obviously not abandoning it completely, but possibly not taking it with you. \n\nHowever, there doesn't seem to be any reason to move apart from her wanting to free up more of your money to blow through.

Tell her to go ahead and move back in with Mommy and Daddy...let them PAY EVERYTHING for her. You and the Indoor cat, rabbit and the hopefully soon to be indoor cat stay where you are.

If you break up with her and have her move it, be very very careful about mentioning the cat. Mention other reasons, like her not working or just general incompatibility.

I bet they would soon be asking you to get rid of the other critters, too.

Seriously moving into a trailer with the pets he already has and her parents?", "No we do not", "She does absolutely nothing to take care of any of the pets. I do everything for all of them and I probably should have added the fact that we did have multiple discussions before I started feeding this cat.", "The thing is before I started feeding the cat we DID talk and at the time she seemed ok with it she even said she was and then she did this 360 out of the blue", "Yeah, it is a gaga idea.", "Thank god", "Not sure why you are engaged to this person. You are in a good place now, why would you move into a trailer with her parents? With her attitude I wouldn't even want her around the pets that I already have....", "Got it. Still, having pets does require both of you to give the green light. Even if she does not shoulder much responsibility for them, they are part of her space, she interacts with them, and is impacted in other ways (for instance, needing to dedicate space for them, having travel and social plans impacted, the fact that pet-friendly places are harder and more expensive to rent). These are the reasons I said both members of the partnership need to be on board.", "Ah, that changes things. In that case, NTA.", "NTA please please please break up with her. All I see are red flags on red flags. She wants to tell you how to spend YOUR money, and it really reflects the type of person she is telling you one thing and then switching up on you, and it's really manipulative the way she treats you and she literally want you to be her and her family's cash cow."]}
