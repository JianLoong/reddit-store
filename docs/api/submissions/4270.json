She wouldn't have to pay anything, and she is without a job atm so wouldn't be able to afford it, which I don't mind ofc. \n\nWe made plans to go out the evening after my workday to go watch a movie at a fancy cool mall here and have a dinner and catch up since we haven't seen each other in a long while, and I'm traveling around for work after this week and won't be back till next year.\n\nI finish my last meeting and get back to the hotel to get dressed and pick her up to go to the mall. She's asking me all these specifics about which mall, what movie, what time the movie is showing, where we're eating dinner, etc. Every time I asnwer a question she says \"okay perfect\" and types it into her phone. \n\nI am getting ready and she casually mentions that her gf will meet us there (her gf lives in the city we traveled to). I'm sorry, but I am paying the hotel and movie and food and roadtrip snacks and everything besides petrol to be able to spend these 24 hours with her. I want to have my best friend all to myself for one evening. Is that too much to ask for? \n\nI responded that I intended to spend the trip with her and have us time but she said she I'm being a bad friend because I know she hasn't been able to see her gf in a while and she can't afford the trip here on her own and that if I really cared for her I'd let her gf come with us. \n\nI understand where she's coming from but I feel used for the trip and really disappointed that I wouldn't get to spend time with her and catch up. I don't know what to do now, we're both laying on the beds in the hotel now not talking and I don't know if I should just let her gf join and brush it off.

Regardless of whether or not you communicated that you expected this to be a bff only trip or not, she could've mentioned her desire to see her gf before y'all hit the road. She intentionally omitted wanting to see her gf and planning to see her while y'all were in town because she was aware, to some degree, that inviting gf was not something you'd want.", "This really sucks. I'm assuming you're paying for her activities. Say, we can all go together but y'all can cover your costs for the activities and I'll cover mine.

My ex at least always asked ahead of time of a friend could join us on an outing / visit a friend while in the area. NTA in that regard", "NTA: Your friend should have asked. It's common courtesy.\n\nWhat makes the road so dangerous? How is having another person there with you making it less dangerous? Are you just putting your friend needlessly in danger?", "ESH. You invited your friend along on a trip to the city where her gf lives.

It does sound like she took advantage. It would've been common courtesy for her to ask you if you're alright with this before the trip was booked and paid for, but she probably knew you wouldn't be glad to sponsor her date night  and rightfully so. \n\nShe could've also compromised with you, for example by arranging a coffee date with her gf before your night out, which I suppose you would've been okay with.", "ESH\n\nDid you know the gf lived in the town you were visiting?\n\nWhat we have here, is failure to communicate.\n\nfrom everybody", "INFO you planned a trip to the city where your broke friend's GF lived and expected her not to see her?\n\nYou can have the girlfriend pick up the tab if it's turning into a date night with you being the third wheel.\n\nYour friend shouldn't be inviting her GF to everything you've planned but there should have been some time alloted for her to see her GF.", "ESH like the previous person said, for not communicating up front. But I think at this point your relationship would be damaged with her if you refuse to let her girlfriend come. If you think it is worth damaging your relationship with a best friend to prove a point then I would say YTA. Probably best to explain why you reacted that way calmly, apologize, let the gf come and do your best to enjoy yourselves :)", "ESH for not communicating your expectations of the trip clearly beforehand", "ESH. She was being a bit sneaky by not telling you, but you don't own her attention for the duration of the trip just because you're the sponsor. You guys will be together for the vast majority of the trip anyway.", "NTA. I\u2019d be feeling weird about it too.", "Compromise. See if you two can have dinner and then meet the GF for the movie.", "NTA - she should have asked you first", "Nta. Your friend obviously knew what she was doing or she'd have mentioned it before. \nShe's used you for a free trip basically.\nI'd tell her if that's the case, her girlfriend can pay for her food, meal and snacks. Since that's why the friend decided to come.", "NTA - She should have said she wanted to see her GF during the trip when you first invited her. If she only realized that day that her GF was available, she should have asked if you minded her GF joining. You two planned a trip together and she either had other plans all along or decided to change the plan unilaterally that day. She purposefully waited until it would be awkward or seem \"mean\" for you to say no. \n\nIf I were you I would have told her she is welcome to go hang out with her GF, but transportation and money for food/activities while she does so is on her. (Though still give her a ride from the hotel to home the next morning.)", "NTA. Is the gf gonna pay for you bf.  I would tell her to go out with her gf and I would have fun on my own but I would not give her any money and the friendship would be down graded", "This is a strange one\u2026 You knew there is a gf in that city, and that your friend is too poor, as you said, to visit her, and none of you mentioned that fact. I think two of you are not real friends tbh. I\u2019d offer my friend free ride to their gf/bf from the get go\u2026 It would have been strange for me to expect friend not to visit them\u2026", "Was the the 5 hr drive to the place not sufficient time to talk one on one and catch up? It was underhanded of her to try to sneak in a gf visit without first clearing it with you. That's why I'm down on her as well. \n\nBut it's ridiculous, the whole thing. Of course if she's going to accompany you on this work trip you should pay for stuff. And you cannot buy her private individual company this way. That's insulting and just strange. What is your issue with her relationship? Do you have feelings for her? I'm asking these things because I don't understand why it would bother you that her girlfriend is joining you for dinner and a movie. It's her girlfriend! ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Say no to both of those if she expects it.", "the E S H comments here seem to not understand that OP is here for work... the plans she made for her and her friend are AFTER the workday, meaning friend has all the time in the day to see her gf. this isnt a communication problem, its 'friend' deciding that two person plans are now for three.

This has such an easy solution\u2026 your friend can see her girlfriend while you\u2019re working. Or if the girlfriend is working when you are, you can just do one thing with her, like you can go to the mall and a movie with just your friend and have dinner with her and her girlfriend.", "> Did you know the gf lived in the town you were visiting?\n\nYeah... everyone could have communicated better, but *of course* she's gonna want to see her girlfriend on the apparently-rare occasion she's in her town.  And unless there are very specific reasons that are outlined beforehand, expecting otherwise is kinda crappy.", "What do you mean ''would be damaged''? It is already damaged. OP stated in the edit that she clearly said beforehand that the trip was just meant for the two of them. The friend could've simply asked, like any other normal person, if it was possible for her to meet up with her gf for a bit, if she's in town anyway. Or have dinner with just OP, but the movie with gf and OP. I am sure they could've come up with a compromise, but friend chose to just invite gf along without asking OP, basically hijacking the trip, and then acting as if OP is the bad friend, when OP is getting rightfully upset.", "But op did\u2026 clearly states that prior said that they are excited for a girl trip and catch up", "I replied before the edit lmao chill"]}
