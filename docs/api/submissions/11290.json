I had a significant merit scholarship (20k/yr), an on-campus job, and a college fund, the direct contribution for my family was relatively low, and I didn't need to take out any loans.\n\nThe money in my college fund came from a hard time in my family. When I was 13, a family friend's daughter (like a cousin to me) died from cancer. Later that year, my grandmother (mom's mother) and uncle (mom's brother) both died very suddenly within two months of each other -- my grandmother was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, and my uncle was found dead shortly after her memorial service.\n\nThat period lead to the breakdown of my parent's marriage. My dad never liked my uncle and would make comments like \"there's only so much you can do for people like that\", and my mom (who was very close with her brother) resents him for keeping my sister and I from having a closer relationship with him. My brother (then 11M) developed an eating disorder that still requires treatment and he has panic attacks if one of our parents calls her after midnight, because he thinks they would only call that late if someone else in our family had died. I had to grow up and look out for him while my mom was recovering, and I became the peacemaker/third parent. My grandmother and uncle left money to my sister and I for college in their wills, but I would have rather had them alive and have had to go to a less expensive college as a result.\n\nRecently, one of my friends from college (24M) asked me if I had seen the news about the student loan repayment pause. I said I did, but I didn't know a lot about it because I didn't have loans. He then started asking me a lot of questions about my family's finances (my mom is currently working part-time, my dad is a teacher) and how I'd been able to go to college without loans. I didn't want to get into it, so I said I had a big scholarship and that my extended family had contributed a bit. He then got frustrated and started to complain about \"rich people who act poor but will never actually struggle\", fixating on the family contributions part. I tried to explain how I had actually gotten the money (it isn't like I have multimillionaire grandparents dispensing cash from their yacht in the Caribbean) and in my explanation I said I was obviously grateful, but I didn't consider it a \"complete blessing\" because of the huge impacts it had on me and my family. My friend got really upset at that and said I was trying to play \"oppression Olympics\" with him and that he was upset that I'd kept the \"truth\" about my family finances from him. He did have to take out a federal loan to go to college, but he also received federal grants and merit aid from the school\n\nWhy I may be the AH: getting the money was difficult and complicated, but doesn't change the fact that at the end of the day I graduated without loans, which is a luxury.", "created_utc": 1677756060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g0c3u/aita_said_i_didnt_consider_college_fund_a/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But this is a great lesson on: \n- keep your finances as private as possible.\n- even apparently close friends can get very jealous and judgmental.\n- some people like to categorize you based on scenarios they made up in their mind, rather than what they see of you with their own eyes!\n\nI second the opinion by other redditors that you should distance yourself from said friend.", "NTA. Why is your friend so worried about whether you have student loans or not? Some people take loans for college (like me) and others don\u2019t (like you). There\u2019s no point in being mad at your own situation and envying others who have it better than you.

Envy leads down a very dark path in friendships/relationships.", "NTA. These deaths destroyed your family. Where does he get off, saying things like that. A friend of mine also inherited an apartment from her childless aunt (amazing lady, passed very young) .

Maybe you should do the same", "NTA --- Your family's financial situation is none of his fucking business.", "NTA\nHe's being nosy and our of line asking about your finances. None of his concern.

In exchange to not having loans, your family fell apart and you had an extremely troubled childhood. It's not a blessing by any means. It's even worse than if you would've just worked from early age and earn the money for collage.", "NTA Getting money because someone you loved died is a mixed blessing. You were correct in keeping your financial affairs quiet. People often act very weird when discussing money.\n\nYour friend, however, is a jealous AH.", "NTA. Short anecdote incoming.\n\nI am 32 and have owned 2 homes. The ONLY reason this is possible is because my dad died at the fault of the hospital when I was 3 and my mom sued them. The settlement was paid in small amounts monthly from the time I turned 18 til I was 25, and then a large sum when I turned 25 (which is when I bought the first house). I was only able to afford a HUGE down payment and the subsequent lower mortgage payment at that age because of that settlement.\n\nI would rather have my dad obviously, just as you'd rather have your family, but it's impossible not to credit this blessing (especially in this economy) to an awful tragedy. It's a mixed blessing.\n\nYour friend started the Oppression Olympics by bringing it up in the first place and getting nosey about your student loans. He sounds incredibly uncaring in this moment and if I were you, I would rethink my friendship with someone who makes me feel bad about being able to afford living because of the death of my family.", "You're NTA. His envy is not your fault and it is not your problem. If this is his attitude, he will go through life resenting everyone who appears to have more than he does.", "NTA I suggest \"Please understand that you're telling me you're angry that I didn't relive several traumatic episodes in my life to give you an explanation for how my college was paid for. I'm not trying to \"win the oppression Olympics\", but I do think you've misunderstood this conversation if you think this money came from rich relatives who could easily dispense it.\"", "NTA, but your friend is. He has no business in asking anyone else about their finances, and is selfish and inconsiderate in responding the way he did to family trauma. You should not have complied with his request to give him information about your finances.", "NTA! Your friend is. What business do they have grilling you about your family\u2019s finances and commenting that you\u2019re playing oppression olympics when you were just telling them about the difficult time you had. A friend should be supportive and happy for you if you are not under crippling debt. I\u2019d run in the opposite direction after giving them a piece of my mind!", "What? Your (bad) friend is not entitled to any information around your or your family\u2019s finances. what a dick. He\u2019s projecting  his feelings onto you. Please don\u2019t feel bad. You have absolutely nothing to feel guilty about. NTA", "NTA in fact NAH, every family's story is different. Your friend pushing you for information about why you don't have loans seem a bit targeted, but it is easy to see why the student debt warps people perception - living with any debt is crushing and being able to be in your 20s, with college degree and debt free must be amazing in the US. It is not your fault your relatives died and they had invested in your future. It is not his fault that his family didn't have this story. Your family finances are not something he was entitled to know in fact, and if he is acting as if \"we wouldn't have been friends if I knew this\" maybe you really aren't the friends you think you are.", "NTA\n\nHow you got the finances for your college education is a tragedy for your family, but it doesn't matter how you got the finances, it is not anyone else's business and your supposed friend is an AH for asking, an AH for pressing for details and an AH for his absurd comments - You deserve better friends and I suggest you go NC with him\n\nAs another redditor commented, this episode is a life lesson not to discuss your finances with other people no matter how close they are to you - well exceptions would be a life partner that you are in a relationship with, a financial advisor - you get the picture, I would even in some cases hesitate to discuss them with family for various reasons.\n\nI will go on to say that no matter what, don't ever discuss things like salary and wages with colleagues when you start working, it can start work jealousies, disharmony in a team that sort of thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
