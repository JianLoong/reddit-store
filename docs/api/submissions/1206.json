I repeatedly told him you can call the office line and I\u2019ll answer and he would laugh and say so you don\u2019t want to give me your #? I said just call the office I will answer. His friend went by the door and the one in front of me stood up put his hands on my desk and kept repeating to give him my # so he can leave. I knew he wasn\u2019t going to get turned down in front of his friend so I panicked and wrote my # down on the card and he left. He went to his car which was NOT the car he was talking about so I knew he was just trying to look \u201ccool.\u201d As soon as they left he texted me and I wasn\u2019t replied so he kept calling me. I blocked him but he knows where I work and has my office # now. As a woman it\u2019s very scary to turn guys down sometimes esp in front of their friends since they want to look cool. But this isn\u2019t the first time I have given my # out and blocked right away. I also don\u2019t turn guys down since they usually are my clients and I don\u2019t want to make it awkward but they put me in such an awkward position.

Your employer is allowing customers to harass you. First of all, I'd find a better place to work. Secondly, give out a fake number. Make sure it looks like a real number, but don't give out your own phone number. Make everything private. \n\nAlso, get a copy of the book \"The Gift Of Fear\" by Gavin de Becker. This book is amazing, and I believe every woman should read it. It completely changed how I interact with men. A large chunk of it talks about predators who don't take no for an answer and how to deal with them. Good luck."]}
