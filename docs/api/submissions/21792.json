And? The parents probably paid for the phone. No child NEEDS a phone. Its a privilege. Most parents justify a phone as a need so they can always contact their child. They took away a privilege (a smartphone) becuase of not following rules (not putting her sister in tiktoks) and replaced it with a need (flip phone).

Alternatively, was there a rule about older daughter checking with other family members before filming in a shared space location? I\u2019m an old person at this point, but I get that the younger generation seems to have a far more widespread and public entrepreneurship spirit when it comes to the internet, so if your daughter\u2019s TikTok account is the first step towards an interest in some aspect of film or entertainment production on a more professional level, I\u2019d hate to think it would be stifled merely because everyone didn\u2019t slow down and think of work around that respect everyone\u2019s wishes before jumping to zero future resolutions.", "NTA but info: if she has that many followers is it monetized in any way? and is there any way in which she might be allowed to do it again? You're not in the wrong given the warnings and filming her sister w/o consent, but I got my first job at that age; if I had a source of income from something I enjoyed doing and was denied access permanently, I'd be pretty pissed.

Unfortunately.\n\nThis measure is a consequence of her actions which she specifically persisted with despite the disregard for reasonable, clearly stated and likely legally enforceable boundaries.\n\nYour younger daughters psychological and emotional safety at home is far more important than your older daughter's social media presence.  Your older daughter clearly refuses to take any measure to ensure her sister's boundaries are respected.

That teacher changed my life)\n\nI don\u2019t know if the older one has other social media as well, but I suggest making sure she hasn\u2019t continued this behavior on other platforms as well.

Your younger daughter has a boundary, your older one has violated it repeatedly, so when she couldn\u2019t follow the rules you took away her ability to violate that rule but still left her able to communicate via calls and texts as necessary. Great job, parental unit!\n\nI think the next very important step is to talk with your eldest about why this issue is so serious. It\u2019s not about her sisters insecurities or mean comments, but if she really believes she wants to be a social media influencer she has to realize there will be real world legal complications to recording people and having people in the background of her videos without their consent. Do a little research for her or with her to show her what kind of legal paper work she\u2019ll need to have for consent, and show her the legal ramifications if she records someone and posts the video without their  permission. She\u2019s 15 and it sounds like she has smart parents, I think she\u2019ll be smart enough to get it once you remove the emotional connection of her \u201cinsecure sister and parental overlords\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s important for kids to learn about privacy and boundaries.", "NTA \u2026 I didn\u2019t get a smart phone until I was a senior in HS and once I broke that one (my parents hand me down) I had to go back to a flip phone", "NTA - you gave more than enough notice. \n\nLet the 13yr old make an embarrassing TikTok of her sister & see how that goes.
