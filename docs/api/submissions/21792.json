She isn't being punished for her sisters insecurities, she is being punished for not following your rules.\n\nI actually think its a plus that she can't post TikToks. That stuff can seriously mess with kids heads and there is no telling what kind of following she is attracting at that age.\n\nMake the TikTok ban permanent.", "NTA\n\nYou set a reasonable boundary regarding other people's consent, and general basic decency, and you made it very clear what the consequences would be if she failed to respect other people's consent. \n\nShe continued to violate her sister's consent, and disregarded your warnings, and you then enforced the consequences that you had warned her about. Which is exactly what parents are supposed to do. \n\nSo not only NTA, but awesome job upholding boundaries, and expectations with your kids.", "NTA, getting rid of TikTok in any way is an automatic NTA.", "NTA. Kids should be kept away from social media as it can be incredibly detrimental to their mental health in SO many ways. She\u2019s also a child so it\u2019s your rules.

But just as an FYI, as a minor, when setting up her iPhone you should have had to put her in a \u201cfamily\u201d with at least one adult who can control things on the phone remotely. You can set limits on screen time, monitor contacts and set communication limits, and you can restrict websites, filter explicit music, etc. You can ban the TikTok app and website through these controls. So she can still have her smartphone for allowed communication and games and stuff but she can\u2019t access TT (or any other social media that you decide to block). I frequently go in to my nieces\u2019 settings this way and limit/allow things based on their behavior.

Putting her sister in that position is even worse.", "NTA, Tik Tok is a Chinese spyware tool which also doubles as a propaganda tool on the Chinese domestic front serving the interests of the Chinese communist party. If you're a Westerner, you should be opposing the use of this app for any reason", "NTA- she shouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable and confined in her own home that\u2019s not fair.

Now sister A will blame sister B even though it was the parents who took the phone. Which will isolate sister B even more, how can you help both sisters connect so sister A wants to respect her sister.", "I think it\u2019s awesome! Congrats for actually parenting your child! \n\nWhen TikTok\u2019s become bullying, it should banned for that kid. NTA!", "NTA.\n\nI hope you've consulted a dermatologist. A lot of birthmarks can be removed.", "NTA if I had a nickel for every time I've said TikTok is a poison...", "NTA you are a parent who cares for both children and you are willing to make an effort.  The Tik Tok princess will live and maybe even learn something.  I wish there were more parents like you in the world", "NTA, you told her what would happen if she kept doing it and she kept doing it.", "NTA.  She's not being punished for her sister's insecurity - she's being punished for her inability to follow basic directions.", "YTA. You said that your oldest put the younger in by MISTAKE, she was not trying to put her sister in the video. And how come the younger did not see her sister was recording? It just doesn\u2019t make sense. If she knew her sister was a Tik tok creator and saw her holding a phone and talking too it, she would know it was a video and get out", "YTA for allowing a 15 year old kid post videos of herself to the internet.

Not \u201c for her sister\u2019s insecurity.\u201c\n\nYou did good, NTA", "NTA but i think replacing her phone with a flip phone might be a little bit too much. Kids these days love to buy new things and have the latest phones, and giving her a flip phone would not only upset her greatly, she could even get bullied for it at school (teenagers are vicious and will judge everything about other teens). I suggest just telling her to delete tiktok and if she doesn\u2019t, i think there\u2019s a way to control what apps your child has on their phone with icloud or something.", "NTA! I bet her birth mark is beautiful. Sorry she doesn\u2019t feel good about it \ud83d\ude22", "NTA... tiktok is trash", "NTA. Your 15yr old daughters self esteem will be better in the long run without TikTok. And your 13yr old will be more well adjusted to the world if she never uses it at all.

It isn\u2019t happening by accident. It is getting her attention which is what she wants. TikTok is making everyone stupid kids and adults", "NTA. Actions have consequences; she's repeatedly tormented her sister. You are doing the right thing.", "NTA. You have my parents of the year award!! I have a lot of respect for you for following through with taking the phone when she wouldn\u2019t stop. Saying your house should be a safe place for both daughters made me smile.", "NTA. You've done the right thing for everybody", "This. Nip this in the bud now or regret it later. Your daughter will hopefully recognize this is for the better. Maybe not. She'll still likely be in her friends' TikToks. \n\nBut really, good on you for making sure it's not in your house. Especially with non-consenters.\n\nNTA.", "Agreed, Westerners should not be so eager to install Chinese government spyware on their devices", "Oh thank God.  I mean, clearly the OP is NTA, but teenagers on here get SO touchy about their phones I was worried about the verdict.  \n\nShe was warned it would happen and she did it anyway - she needs to learn social media needs to take a back seat to being a good person.", "AARP advertisers has them for older people, a good assortment.  I am not joking.", "I am not sure, but people use the term TikTok for both having an account and making the videos.  My guess would be the older makes videos, the younger just watches them.", "Maybe the other one is but doesnt make videos, or their friends have tiktok and shared it with thiem.", "Oh please if you think it was by mistake after the first or second time it happened I have a bridge to sell you in Florida", "Lol im sorry. But we have got to stop playing the bully card for everything. This is the consequence of their actions. If they didn\u2019t want to be \u201cbullied\u201d for a flip phone then they should have listened.  Also there is a difference between bullying and making fun of, poking fun of someone", "> she could even get bullied for it\n\nOh no, how ever will she survive??", "I work for an aerospace company and they haven\u2019t come right out and told us we\u2019re not allowed to use it, but they\u2019ve strongly suggested we don\u2019t download it on our phones.", "ok but by the looks of it the parents didn\u2019t give her any warning that it would be a FLIP PHONE, they just said they would take her phone away. and with that being said, the phone itself isn\u2019t the problem here, it was just tiktok, and if they encouraged her to delete it and monitored her apps then a lot of animosity could be avoided.", "Okay? And? The parents probably paid for the phone. No child NEEDS a phone. Its a privilege. Most parents justify a phone as a need so they can always contact their child. They took away a privilege (a smartphone) becuase of not following rules (not putting her sister in tiktoks) and replaced it with a need (flip phone). Im sorry but this was good parenting and I agree.\n\nEDIT: and whats to stop the teen from using istagram, facebook, and other platforms to do the exact same thing?"]}
