If his shower/bath sessions are that long and a person can't keep waiting until he is out in order to fetch something, then that might be something to discuss with your son. While he is staying with his mum, there's also the fact that there are essentially strangers who are also living there who want to feel at home in their own place too, so there's got to be some form of meeting half way. Maybe he can take showers as long as he likes under your roof, but that is not necessarily as realistic in another house where there are unrelated people living there too. The scenario I'm talking about is very occasional cases where the person absolutely has to get something from the bathroom then and there, in which case they can maybe knock on the door to give your son a heads up, then slip in, get the object and slip out asap. Or, in this case, ask his mum to fetch it for them, seeing as she's his mother.\n\nThat being said, if that roommate has a habit of entering the bathroom while your son is in there and just staying there, then yeah, that is a cause for concern and I would also feel uncomfortable for him. Those are his formative years after all. I wouldn't feel comfortable if someone of the same sex walked in while I was showering, let alone someone of the opposite sex, and on a regular basis, REGARDLESS whether they're interested or not.", "NTA there should absolutely be no adult other than parents (and even then only in certain conditions) seeing a 10yo naked.

You will have to get the custody changed or mom can come take him back even screaming.  \n\nWhy in the world would she allow her roommate walk in on her son; why would her roommate think it was an ok thing to do?  Just so many questions.  \n\nYou did good protecting your son, now you have to finish it up with the paperwork.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely. Call the lawyer.", "My dad was abusive, had evidence of abuse, had tried to kidnap me in the past, but if my mother ever tried to keep me during his custodial time it would have been \u201ckidnapping\u201d and would\u2019ve given him a leg up in any court case.\n\nUnfortunately, keeping the son may make things worse in the long run. Definitely needs a lawyer.", "I used to stay in a dormitory in high school. Some floors were for boys and some for girls, there were both male and female teachers taking care of us, but for the nights only one teacher stayed. They went around at 10pm telling us to go to bed and around 6 am waking us up.\n\nThey *always* knocked and waited for our response if they wanted to come in, and most of the time (especially the male teachers in the mornings when they knew some of us were already getting ready) didn't even come in, just knocked and loudly said good morning.\n\nThen a new male teacher came, and he always opened the doors without knocking first. He also did this in the morning when most of us were changing or just generally getting ready, not fully clothed yet. I've told him it makes me uncomfortable, but he kept doing it. I told other teachers, and he still kept doing it. In the end I talked to my parents, and we requested a transfer to another, all girls dormitory. Part of the process was that I had to speak to the (female) head of whatever, who was the head of all dormitories for that school and who could make the final choice. I told her that man *always* comes in when I'm getting dressed in the morning, he opens the door without knocking, he doesn't leave when he sees that we are not dressed yet, and that he always stays for a few seconds, telling us to get up and get ready, despite us clearly being in the process of getting ready. You might think this raised all kind of flags and rang all the alarm bells in her head, but no. What she said? \"Mr X. has a girlfriend, I don't think he looks at you like that\". We were 14-18 years olds and this guy was *at least* in his 30s. But sure, he had a girlfriend, so that means he can stare at half naked teenage girls I guess.\n\nI still can't wrap my head around it, and the older I get just the more angry I get thinking about the whole thing. Like if you're at a point where you have to defend a grown ass person by saying they are not sexually attracted to or interested in a child/teenager, when they make that child uncomfortable, how do you not realise you're in the fucking wrong?", ">It would not occur to me that I needed to confirm that an adult woman was not interested in a little boy, and it's odd that that was her first reaction.\n\nThat was precisely my first thought. It's so bizarre.", "A lot of people don't think sexual assault by women \"counts\". Just look at the comments under any article about female teachers and male students. It's sadly common to find ppl who genuinely believe you can't rape a man because men always want sex, or his penis got hard so he clearly wanted it. \n\nToxic masculinity hurts everyone.", "[removed]", "[removed]", " Just bc something is obvious and sensible from a basic human perspective, doesn't mean it won't get you into trouble with a family court judge if you've \"violated\" a custody agreement.", "Predators come in all genders!! \n\nMy family members that investigate these CASM & human trafficking cases say they arrest more women than the public would want to know because of the erroneous belief that \"women don't don't do that kind of thing very much.\" And the news doesn't report on these female offenders nearly as much as the male offenders.\n\nOP - NTA!! Do what you're doing and protect your child! Please make a police report ASAP about what your son is saying, file for whatever emergency custody change you can in your area because your ex knows about the issue and doesn't care that your child is at risk & scared to be in her home. \n\n(That roommate could be taking photos or video using \"spy cameras\" as well that even your ex is unaware of. Make a police report!! And dont warn the ex sonshe can't warn the roommate.)", "Hi, Stacy.  I really don't like the beach.  I don't think you can live here.", "Mom probably thinks all predators are men. Can she say Mary Kay Letourneau?", "No, it's best to just keep the boy with him. He should, however, think about telling the police or *someone* about it, so he can apply for full custody and have a case where he reported this incident backing him up. The mom's attitude is insane.", "And this is what a good parent looks like.  Good on you, and call your lawyer today to start the process of reworking the custody agreement.", "That's disgraceful, but far from surprising. What did the gf have to do with anything - had the head never heard of cheating before? Even removing that, even if he was totally oblivious and there was no creep factor at all... you, as a whole human, stated that you were uncomfortable and would prefer that he slightly alter his behaviour in line with every other adult in the same position to accommodate your comfort in a living space, and ge refused to grant you that dignity and respect. He could have been a dickless wonder who had bever even heard if sex and he would still have been entirely in the wrong and not suited to that role!!\n\nJFC I swear this just isn't this hard.\n(I am really sorry for the rant, I am second hand absolutely furious on your behalf and tend to be overly verbose)", "I'm so sorry you went through that. That guy should had the riot act read to him for that behavior at the very least. I would have wanted the police involved.", "This is infuriating. I\u2019ve long since learned the power of formal complaints. Now if schools act like shitty behavior is fine I ask to file a formal complaint, I email the principle and ask how to file a grievance with the school board and/or any other enforcement authority, and I cc anyone and everyone I can find at the upper levels. \n\nI don\u2019t care if they dislike me for making such a stink. Their willful disregard of safety will be on record.", "[removed]", "Things like this are about power and control. He was going to do it and no adult was making him stop. I'm so sorry this happened. I am glad less of this will fly in today's climate.", "I'm praying this was a while ago, and that people have learned from their mistakes.  Because the school's reaction is appalling, and we've learned that many abusers maintain outside relationships, they're completely irrelevant.", "When I was in high school, there was a teacher who was also a dean who really, really hated me. He lived at the school but in a boys' dorm, so I mostly never interacted with him in the girls' dorm. \n\nOne night after curfew and lights-out, he knocked on my door. Of course my roommate and I were both in PJs, no bras on, and all. And when I answered the door (we knew it was him because we had heard him talking outside the door), he tried to push his way in. \n\nI stuck my foot around the back of the door so he could not open it any wider and crammed myself into the gap that was open. My roommate (she was younger than me) was literally fully hiding under her covers. I don't even remember what he said, he was just harassing me as usual, but I was NOT going to let him into that room. I shook for an hour after I got him to leave. I spoke to one of the dorm teachers, but she said he's a dean and he can do what he wants, she couldn't stop him.\n\nHe was a truly vile man. He blocked me from being in student government after I was chosen, and he tried to get me kicked out of the dorm near the end of my senior year. Fortunately he left the school when I did.", "The obvious first thought of any decent parent would be, \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem that my kid feels unsafe, even if it *is* a misunderstanding.\u201d \n\nDo not send your son back to that house.", "Yup.", "while she was being sexist", "The mom didn\u2019t even deny what happened. What a terrible take this is", "You would have NEVER said that if it were a 40 year old guy trying to continuously walk into an underage girl naked. I'm sorry but a child will never forgive you for letting them be sexually harassed just to maintain someone's \"authority\".", "how is he being high conflict here? his son expressed his discomfort clearly and doesnt want tp go there. if your kid is acting such way do you think its in his best interest to send him back to a place he feels so unsafe?", "I\u2019d risk it over forcing my son to return to a home in which he felt unsafe.", "That's cute and all, but this child has expressed discomfort; this isn't some wild accusation. He was uncomfortable and didn't want to say why, as is normal, and then he did say why, so the dad is acting accordingly. Then dad tried to talk to mom, and mom said it didn't matter that this was happening, because the roommate is a woman.\n\nLike what if it was something else? Not even just female child and male roommate, but say this woman just...always, seemingly purposefully (because the boy said \"she ***keeps*** seeing me naked\") waved a knife super close to this kid's face. The kid thinks/knows that it's on purpose. Mom keeps insisting the roommate is clumsy or distracted or whatever. But this kid doesn't want to go anymore, because he's pretty sure this knife-waving is happening on purpose, so he tells dad. Should dad just ignore him and send him over? What if this is the day where the roommate goes further and nicks him, or outright slashes at him? Same thing. OP should not send the boy over to a potential creep, because it's already bad, but there's no way to know when it'll become worse.\n\nSo, no. The kid stays home, and OP can get started on whatever legal tools he has.", "Yeah, it doesn't even matter if he had a girlfriend or not. I would have been uncomfortable with any of the female teachers, my roommates, or even my own mother marching in when I was changing clothes. And the latter two have seen me naked in other circumstances where I had no issue with that.\n\nI don't understand why it's so hard to treat people with respect and to not dismiss younger people's feelings and boundaries just because they are not legally an adult yet.", "Yeh exactly! Even if the lady is a moron who can\u2019t work out how to knock it\u2019s still unacceptable", "Bot, comment partially stolen from u/NightOwlIvy_93", "Damn right. The kid isn\u2019t comfortable there and that\u2019s what matters. OP: NTA. You did the right thing.", "It is so sad that the mother can't see that she is hurting her son. Maybe she just doesn't care...?", "Thank you for the award to help highlight my comment.", "Especially an unrelated child. And this is a random roommate, a stranger. How long have they even been renting there?\n\nI mean I\u2019m in my 30s, some of my friends have kids, yes I\u2019ve helped with nappy changing when they were babies, and for some of them there\u2019s been a handful of times when they\u2019ve been sick or tipped something all over themselves and due to the situations I\u2019ve helped them wash up and change clothes.\n\nBut those kids also call me Aunty and if any of them said no when I offered to help them wash/change, I\u2019d say no problem I\u2019ll go get one of your parents. Like some kids just don\u2019t like being seen naked, I was one of them, even with my own immediate family. If they\u2019d asked I\u2019d have helped them wash up, got them a change of clothes, and stood outside the bathroom door for them to undress and redress themselves and just offer help with any tricky buttons or clasps yaknow? And this was obviously when they were all like 5-6, at 10 they take care of their own hygiene and dressing!", "That's fine. Repeated contempt of court will ultimately cause one to lose custody entirely.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s unreasonable to protect kids. I\u2019m saying that in high-conflict parenting, false accusations are very common, and therefore everything needs to involve a dispassionate third party.", "He can go through the proper channels eventually, but for today, he's not handing the boy over to a predator and a woman that doesn't care. Some things take time, and the kid should be and feel safe in the meantime.", "No worries, easily done."]}
