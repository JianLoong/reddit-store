He said \"she keeps seeing me naked.\"\n\nI was pissed that my son is sharing a bathroom with his mom's roommate. His mom said Jared's not even there half the time so why does he need his own bathroom?

Plus Jared likes taking long baths and showers.\n\nI said Jared has a legit reason for not going back so he's not. Call the sheriff but they're not going to force him to go back and they'll be more interested why your roommates are in the bathroom while your son is in there. She has far more to lose than I do. The only person he feels comfortable with seeing him naked is me, his half brothers, his doctor and his friends. \n\nI asked to reconsider her stance if her roommates were men and we had a daughter.

It\u2019s also not inappropriate for them to share a bathroom - but point is that your son does need privacy and is asking for it very clearly and neither your wife nor her roommate are respecting that.

If it does and your son isn't using the lock, and this woman is walking in accidentally and walking back out, then your son needs to lock the door.

You need to know, if there is a lock and you need to know what the woman did/said. Did she walk in, pause and look, then leave or did she walk in, see him, and turn around straight away?", "NTA.  If she's actually seeing him naked, she's timing it pretty well since there should be a curtain when he is actually showering/bathing.

If his shower/bath sessions are that long and a person can't keep waiting until he is out in order to fetch something, then that might be something to discuss with your son. While he is staying with his mum, there's also the fact that there are essentially strangers who are also living there who want to feel at home in their own place too, so there's got to be some form of meeting half way. Maybe he can take showers as long as he likes under your roof, but that is not necessarily as realistic in another house where there are unrelated people living there too. The scenario I'm talking about is very occasional cases where the person absolutely has to get something from the bathroom then and there, in which case they can maybe knock on the door to give your son a heads up, then slip in, get the object and slip out asap. Or, in this case, ask his mum to fetch it for them, seeing as she's his mother.\n\nThat being said, if that roommate has a habit of entering the bathroom while your son is in there and just staying there, then yeah, that is a cause for concern and I would also feel uncomfortable for him. Those are his formative years after all. I wouldn't feel comfortable if someone of the same sex walked in while I was showering, let alone someone of the opposite sex, and on a regular basis, REGARDLESS whether they're interested or not.", "NTA there should absolutely be no adult other than parents (and even then only in certain conditions) seeing a 10yo naked. It\u2019s our jobs as parents to guarantee that *minimum* boundary of privacy.", "It's still a lot of ppl who he doesnt mind seeing him naked lol. \n\nIt's normal for someone his age doesnt wanna be seen naked by female or any stranger.

If you think your son is being harmed, you file a DSS/CPS report and/or take your ex to court to modify custody. You do not get to unilaterally usurp your co-parent's authority and rights.\n\nRather than be antagonistic about this sort of thing, it would actually be in your son's best interest to find a therapist skilled at dealing with high-conflict parenting to have that person help your son feel heard by both parents.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
