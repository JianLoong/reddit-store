It made a decent amount of money the first couple of months but then dropped of rapidly as school budgets shrunk. Now it makes a pittance but takes up all her time.\n\nSo now all of the finicial burden falls on my shoulders, I pay for everything from the house, to food, to childcare bills. Whilst she is flipping from one idea to another make the square root of fuck all towards the house.\n\nAnyway that's the backstory.\n\nMy daughter came home from school upset that her best friend who has just come back from skiing this winter has now told her that she's going to Disney land in the summer.\n\nWell I had had a bad day, I had to work another 12 hour day (7th in a row), the boiler now looks like it needs replacing and the house was a shit tip.\n\nSo I lost my temper and control. And told my daughter how it is breaking down the finances of the house and how her mother is actually a negative impact on the house.\n\n\nWell my missus heard and I'm a arsehole for telling my daughter the truth and apparently the multiple times I asked her to get a salaried job  wasn't me telling her that I was fed up of the situation.\n\nTldr: wife quits salaried job to follow her \"dreams\" at the massive detriment to the household, daughter questions why we are poor and I give the reason that pissed wife off.\n\n\nEdit. \nFor those saying I should talk to my wife. \nI have on multiple occasions, last year I was in a bad car crash, covered in lacerations across my face and forearms, I still had to go into work as I couldn't afford to lose the contract.\nMy wife's family have told her she doesn't listen. It's ok for me to work to the point that Im suffering mentally and physically aslong as she gets her dream.\n\nSecondly I'm made out as the bad guy to.my daughter cos I say no to everything apparently. I've heard my wife tell my daughter \"don't bother going to your dad he'll only say no\"\nI'm working my arse off for the family and I'm made out to be the one stopping us from doing/ having things. How's that fucking fair.\n\nI'm having to go back off shore/ work abroad to pay for the fucking house and all the shit, so I get to be less a part of my daughters life.\n\nMy father died at 55 and I doubt I'm gonna make it to that point if the level of stress carries on.", "created_utc": 1679556995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zcpjf/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_the_reason_we_dont/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But your wife also is TA for not realizing that her 15 minutes of fame are over and she needs to get a job to support her own family. You should have told your wife clearly to get a job. If she wants to follow her dreams she can still get a part-time job to at least earn a bit of money.", "After reading your comments and your edit you have two options you either you and your wife seek counseling or get a divorce. Your frustrations are valid but it's not ok to involve your child in this. \n\n\nDon't stay for the sake of the child if your both unhappy and honestly it does more harm than good. Your marriage sets the tone for her future relationship either how she'll accepts being treated or treats her future partners. Don't normalize this for your daughter.", "INFO: how old is your daughter? You talk about childcare costs but then she is old enough for school?", "It's assholish parenting to tell that to a child... but you are burned out. I suggest you change the way you talk with your wife.  Instead of generic \"Stop dreaming, get a real job\" make an effort to listen to her, let her explain to you what her vision is. When you are listening and let her explain, she might catch the holes in her plan herself, as she is not able to explain it to somebody else. Then ask her about timetable. The best would be that you make some time limit e.g. two months, real goals she should achieve by the two months and agree on what will happen if her plans don't work. For example she will get a salaried job for 1 year to fix your family finances and after the one year you can have again this talk about her dreams. Maybe she will be able to learn something that would be useful, she isn't there now.", "ESH - Everyone Sucks Here and here is why:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. You took your frustrations about your wife's career choices out on your daughter - yelling at your daughter was unfair.  I get that you are tired from 12 hour days, but anger and frustration are with your wife, not your daughter\n2. Your wife appears to be oblivious to the effect her career choices are having on her husband and her daughter.  You and your wife need to have some serious discussions about money.  both adults in the family need to be pulling their weight financially, and in parenting responsibilities.  If you and wife  didn't have a down to earth discussion about starting her own biz from home before it was started, then that is something you both need to address now.   Sounds like you've asked her to get a salaried job and she's ignored you - which is unfair.  She should be as aware of the cost of the household as you are or it is not a partnership - right?\n3. Father and mother seem to have raised an entitled daughter who feels that just because the daughter's friend's family can afford skiing and Disneyland trips,  the daughter's family should be able to enjoy the same lifestyle.  Do everyone a favour and teach your daughter the reality of today's finances.  But do it nicely.  If she wants to travel, perhaps it is time for her to have a job and save her money? (you do not mention her age so not sure if this is appropriate suggestion.)  Note:  I am assuming that your daughter is in her teens ?", "ESH. You shouldn't have used your daughter to vent about her mother. No matter how (understandably) stressed you are.\n\nWife needs to actually listen to you, and  start pulling her weight as it is completely unfair on you that's she's placing the entire financial burden on your shoulders. During a really, really difficult time for a lot of folks.", "YTA\n\nThe daughter can hear \"We can't afford it.\"\n\nBut it's absolutely inappropriate to vent your anger toward your wife to your daughter.  She is a child, not your therapist.  Your wife is a your partner, not a punching bag.  \n\nThere are ways to go about this, like having an adult convo with your wife (and not a literal child) about income and money.  Exploding in rage is absolutely, incontrovertibly wrong", "Look.\nShe's a child and doesn't need to be involved in adult matters.\nSo, YTA for how you said it.\n\nBut dude, you don't need a judgement from a bunch of strangers from the Internet, you need a divorce lawyer.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is taking advantage of you financially to fulfill a non successful dream. \n\nIn no way in hell is it fair for you to work 27 days a month 12 hours everyday for years just so she can try different unsuccessful side hustles.

Yes, she was right to try and fulfil her dream, but if it's not feasible anymore, then she should stop and reassess, ideally together.\n\nWith regards to the teacher salary, I can see that you're posting figures in \u00a3.

What was your goal here? To ensure that your daughter doesn't respect her mother? To say things to a child you can't handle saying to your wife directly and dealing with? To show your daughter that you're vulnerable (kids love that!) That was completely inappropriate and also feels like it might not have been entirely honest. Were you keeping up with her more wealthy classmates before? Do you even like your wife and want to be married? Because the contempt rolling off you is obvious and, honestly, pretty cringe. Work things out with your wife or don't but there's no need to involve your kid or undermine their relationship.", "NTA she should have followed her dreams before she started popping offspring. After that offspring take priority for 18 years", "Yta for using your wife as blame for her not going on a clearly expensive trip. Talking to your child about marriage situations is unfair to her and your wife. You will only create resentment between her mother and her, or you and her. Grow up", "YTA. You could have just explained the finances to her and then later had a separate conversation with your wife about this. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019ve worked 12 12 hour shifts bro. It\u2019s not your kids fault and exposing her to this and making it about her mom is unacceptable.", "As someone whose parents have come to her to shit talk, YTA. Don\u2019t involve your child for the love of god.", "YTA. Whether you fully realize it or not, you're weaponizing your daughter and her disappointment against your wife to try and force her into doing what you want. That that thing (going back to a more stable employment situation) is objectively a pretty good thing is irrelevant; you're being incredibly underhanded and controlling and making your daughter a part of your fights is terrible parenting.", "YTA\n\n>And told my daughter how it is breaking down the finances of the house and how her mother is actually a negative impact on the house.\n\nI mean, from where I'm standing, you're pretty much a \"negative impact\" on the house yourself, with all your bitterness that you're loading off on to your daughter.\n\nAnd btw - ski trips and Disney vacations are *expensive*.  Teachers don't make that much money.  Do you really think you'd be rich enough to afford all that even with your wife pulling in a teacher's salary?  Don't blame her because you're unhappy with your own financial situation.", "NTA. Your wife sure is though", "YTA\n\nAs much because of the way you speak about your wife (calling her the missus) and how you refer to her career choice (child welfare and development bollocks).  But also how you reacted the way you did and badmouthing her to your daughter.\n\nInstead of disrespecting her for having the get up and go about her to start a business why don't you look to support her making it a success and you will both benefit from it.", "yta\n\nfor putting this on a child instead of talking with your wife like a adult\n\nyou have caused strain on your daughter and her mum and put a burden of worry on your daughter", "I just looked at your post history, I have a feeling this isn\u2019t just resentment towards your wife over her jobs but also other behaviours that have upset you. ESH apart from your daughter, who is an innocent bystander being pitted against both parents by the other party. Get some couple\u2019s therapy or split up, but stop bad mouthing each other to your kid. It will mess them up and they\u2019ll struggle with trust and communication because of you.", "YTA- I would be tired of it as well so I get why you did it. But you should have had a talk with your wife breaking down the finances, telling her that what she is doing is not productive and that you need her to actually bring in a steady salary.", "YTA. You need to talk with your wife and find a solution, your daughter does not need to know details and have the burden of family finances.", "Big ESH, but ngl you moreso than anyone else.\n\nThis is entirely an issue between you and your wife, and yet, you decided it was ok to traumatize (yes! That's what you did!) your kid because you were tired. You can't just explain away insane behaviour like this with \"oh but I worked 12 hours so I was tired\" like if you had yelled at a clerk at a shop \"because you were tired\" there's no doubt you'd be the asshole, so why would you suddenly not be for yelling at YOUR OWN CHILD because you were tired?\n\nI get that you have tried to talk to your wife about this, and that she refuses to pull her weight, but unfortunately for you, that does not entirely wipe the guilt off your plate here either. The grownup thing to do in this situation is to do what's best for your kid, and as much as this sucks, that might be divorce. That's extreme though, and I'd definitely recommend couples counselling if thats at all a possibility", "YTA", "I'm going with ESH- you for failing to manage your anger and resentment to the point that you lashed out at your daughter and your wife for ignoring how her actions are affecting the household. She seems to have dug in on her position and buried her head in the sand.\n\nYour anger and resentment is quite clear. Is there any way you can access mental health services to help you deal with the stress? She also seems angry/resentful so perhaps couples therapy could help. I'm sorry you're not getting the time with your daughter that you would like to have because of the situation. \n\nAs your wife is apparently ignoring your repeated requests to help support the household financially and how supporting everything yourself is affecting you, perhaps you should explore the possibility of separation. It's just as unfair for her to ignore you and paint you as the bad guy as it is for you to paint her as the bad guy and ignore her dream.
