Inmates are people are deserve to have their health considered too. BTW, I think the number \u201cone thousand three hundred twelve\u201d is applicable.", "Nta. Whether your patients are potentially faking is irrellevent because you owe your patients a standard of care. To ignore potential medical issues because they are inmates would be a dereliction of duty. I'm not sure about the medical degrees necessary for your field but I'm assuming that any charges or findings of negligence or dereliction of your duties could be a legal liability potentially costing you your license to practice. The guards are not qualified to make those decisions. And it sounds like your fellow emts may want to re examine why they are in a medical field if they have no compassion for their patients.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately prisons are not about rehabilitation. I had a professor a few semesters ago that did a research paper about a youth detention center back in the 90s. He would go to the center every day for 3 years and hang out with the kids, talk to them, play cards with them, and interview them. He said it's similar to street gangs, the inmates are in their own gangs and the guards are in their own gangs. He had some brutal stories to share about the guards mistreatment of the kids. If you went against the status quo and started questioning their strategies or behavior (the guards) they didn't like that and they eventually stopped him from coming around. My friend spent a few months in jail a couple years ago and he said the same thing, there are gangs. It's about power and control, not rehabilitation and reintegration. In there it's basically the wild wild west. You're going to get weird looks from the guards for actually showing compassion with the inmates, but you're exactly the type of person that prisons need so badly.", "NTA. This is a huge problem in our system. Prisoners are people too. I'm friends with a public defender and so many are just young people who were never given the nurturing and opportunities they needed to avoid that life. Whatever the case, be the person you can live with being. Live without regrets, and act so you can sleep well at night with a good conscience.", "To add more: \n\nI have only worked 30 hours in the facility. It\u2019s quite the adjustment from what I learned in EMT school. I try to do things based on the national registry. When I\u2019m doing cell checks, I want to make sure the patients are alive and breathing. The officers don\u2019t like this because they think I\u2019m disturbing the patients. If I\u2019m not seeing chest rise and fall, I\u2019m going to knock on the door to make sure they\u2019re alive. The officers hate this. I hate that they\u2019re trying to force me to be negligent. It\u2019s not just the officers doing this, it\u2019s everyone. Especially the other EMTs who would rather be besties with the officers than care for patients.", "NTA, good grief. How are you supposed to do your job if you're supposed to go in with the attitude that everyone is faking? This is horrific neglect, wanting you to leave a badly injured person alone rather than seeking treatment because he's not one of the \"good guys\" in their estimation.", "NTA.  As medical professionals we should see no color, no judgement, none of that stuff. We should see only a human being that needs medical care.", "NTA - your responsibility is to take care of patients, no matter who they are. Professional boundaries are important, but providing medical care for people who need it is the right thing to do. \n\nIt sounds like the officers there are toxic. You might want to think about looking for a new job. Any hospital would be lucky to have you.", "Nta. These are people, not demons. Vulnerable people with historically bad access to any medical care because of who they are viewed by society. Are they all good nice people? Of course not, and you should stay alert to that. But they aren't all evil sociopaths either.  Everyone deserves medical care. Kudos for being the one person that treats them like human beings. Don't let people kill that compassion in you, the world needs that", "NTA. People unwilling to do their work the right way will always try to drag you down to their level. Don't let them. You don't need work friends to do your work well.", "NTA", "NTA - And may whatever deity or force you believe in bless you for who you are. Keep an eye out for super quick burnout, though.

The penal system is not designed to help people, it's designed to make them miserable and exploit them. People in prisons are treated as if they are not human, and it's deplorable.

They can't go to an outside provider, and they can't get themselves the help they need because they don't have that freedom. The way we treat people who are dependent upon us is a very clear measure of what kind of people we are.", "NTA and thank God the inmates have someone like you caring for them.", "NTA- please advocate for your patients as usual.

Apathy becomes prevalent in prison and the reasons for this apathy is too numerous to list. Unfortunately many prison employees become addicted to the criminal thinking lifestyle where they firmly believe that everything is someone else's fault and everything they do is in the right. It is very seductive. I have seen men die laying on the floor in the medical dept waiting to be seen by nurses that would just step over him. There are too many times to count where medical neglect was at fault. Never was it just the medical staff's fault, custody and administration always had an influence in these matters, as you have witnessed. It is almost deliberate indifference. Please be careful during your career not to be seduced by this criminal thinking. Everyday you need to take time out of your day to analyze your actions for the day and think about what you could have done better or different. Never blame others for your mood, actions, or thoughts. Never lie to yourself, avoid close friendships with co-workers, limit the amount of time you spend outside of work with them. Have no affairs at work. All of your close friends need to be outside of your work. Don't let staff or inmates know very much about your personal life. What I described is a rough way to go about it, but it is the only way you can make this a successful career without becoming  an unintentional evil sadist like many of your coworkers. Good luck", "The officers aren\u2019t my employers. I\u2019m employed by medical professionals. Some of the medical professionals are amazing. Some of them aren\u2019t. They definitely do care more than the officers.", "It\u2019s not just weird looks I\u2019m getting. It\u2019s complete hostility, anger, and aggression that I\u2019m getting. I\u2019m getting yelled at. One of the officers made me cry and lectured me that they\u2019re the ones protecting me, so I need to stand with them and not the *psychotic inmates*.", "I really hope that you are able to maintain your empathy, and go against the pressure that your going to have to forget that the people you are working with are human. It's going to be hard to maintain it, but if you are able to, you will be an incredible blessing in these people's lives. You can be a ray of humanity for them.", "A big part of it is that I\u2019m sure, somewhere deep down inside, the officers do care a *little*. It\u2019s just that if they have to take them to the hospital, it ruins their entire day because they have to sit with the patient in the hospital until they\u2019re cleared. They really don\u2019t want to have to do that because they lose their freedom of being on their phone in the office, laughing at the inmates with mental health issues, and being a bully overall. \n\nI had a great view of police officers before I started. I\u2019m now starting to think that many chose this position simply to exert power over the vulnerable.", "Another part is that I have no idea what any of the patients did because I\u2019m not in the \u2018clique\u2019 that likes to be mean to them. I\u2019m a complete outsider to the officers and other emts. They all seem to think I\u2019m against them for caring. An officer yelled at me and called me stupid yesterday, told me I\u2019m going to have a horrible day and get fired if I \u201ckeep it up.\u201d I was told that the officers control whether I get to keep my job or not and if I\u2019m not on \u201ctheir side,\u201d I don\u2019t get to stay. \n\nMy supervisor came and spoke to me yesterday about the bullying, I was basically told to stop being butthurt, but they do not get to decide whether I keep my job or not.", "I\u2019ve already got a target on my back that\u2019s going to be incredibly difficult remove.

Please take care of yourself and make sure you have the support you need to not get burnt out, and watch your back. The officers may not be your bosses, but your colleagues are going to isolate you at best, and might deliberately undermine you or try their best to threaten your job security.

These idiots need to understand that you're in the medical field. You can't have an \"us vs. them\" mentality because if you did, someone could die,  and that would be on you, not just your career but your mental health. They need to grow up, and I don't mean to be rude, but you need to stand up for yourself. Shut that shit down as soon as they cop a tone with you. We need more people like you in jobs like that.", "Yeah that doesn't surprise me.. \ud83d\ude1e they're probably going to keep doing that until you break and quit. If they don't think you're \"on their side\" they'll assume you're on \"the bad guy's side.\" It's totally fucked. Our prison system is deplorable, it's just a way for states to benefit from slave labor. They do everything they can to push inmates to their limits and then extend their sentences. Guards want control, their bosses want money, inmates want to be seen as human beings. We need a prison reform desperately. Along with police reform. I am really sorry you're experiencing this... When I started my bachelor's degree I intended to become a correctional counselor but I don't think I can handle it anymore. After learning about prisons and guards and such, my heart would be in the right place for the inmates but that would put a target on my back. I wish you the best, I hope things get better for you.

It's not fair.", "Yeah let me tell you a story, my best friend from high school her mom was a prison guard in the men\u2019s state prison for 20 years. She was a sweet little older lady and she was only about 5 feet tall but she was always very kind to everyone and just a wonderful person.\n\nShe got a lot of crap on the job, most of the other COs were men and maybe it was different back in the 80s or 70s or whenever she was doing it but I don\u2019t think they liked having a tiny little woman as their back up.\n\nI wish I could remember the details but something bad went down in that prison one day, some kind of a riot, and whoever she was working with locked her on the unit with a bunch of violent men, he claimed it was accidental he didn\u2019t know she was still there or something. These hard violent inmates protected her through the whole riot and they actually spoke up against the man who left her behind.\n\nSome of these inmates are better people than the COs.", "Eh don't kid your self  the officers don't care ppl that become co or police officers do it bc they want the power over others they want to feel like they are better then everyone else ppl that work them kind of jobs are most of the time narcissists", "U say u think they care deep down but then say they laugh and make fun of inmates with mental health issues umm u can't have it both way. They can't care if there maken fun of them.", "It ruins their day? Because the guy with the brain bleed is having a wonderful time I'm sure SMH. \nLook, I briefly worked in the medical field and had to deal with COs at the hospital I worked at. Had a few argue with me about doing a stress test , they wanted the guy to run on the treadmill with the ankle cuffs on. Ummmmm yeah. Luckily the docs backed me up. Just be firm and tell them this is you job, you are doing what you are trained to do, and they need to respect that. Don't back down.", "It doesn't matter what they did. Just matters what they are doing in the moments they are in your care. \n\nPeople don't like when criminals are shown compassion in this county. Never have probably never will. Forget bullying complaints etc and go with \"i am being prevented from doing my job, they are interfering with my job, i am being punished for doing my job\"etc. They are the problem, not you.

Honestly, it's easier to do your job if you don't know. Years ago there was a patient admitted to my telemetry floor with two police officers on the door. When I and another nurse went to the room, one of them said (with real venom in his voice) \"don't you want to know what he did?\" I replied \"No. Because we're going to care for him anyway, regardless. Knowing would just make it harder for us, it wouldn't change anything for him\".", "I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I have some relatives that are corrections officers, and they don't really care about the inmates, or even each other. It's a toxic environment, from the sounds of it. Maybe try to transfer to an outside agency instead? I don't think you should leave the medical field altogether. You sound like you'd be an asset to the system. I think the misunderstanding was more of a projection by your coworkers, but I wasn't there, so I can't say for sure, obviously.  \n\n\nThere also might be a bit of hazing at play here too.
