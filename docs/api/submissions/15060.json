She was heavily pregnant and the soonest I could get her in to have her spayed was post when she would have had them, so they were not removed and she had them just a few days ago. \n\nShe had a particularly large litter and is a smaller cat. The birth itself went fine, she passed the placenta, and they\u2019re all healthy, happy, and wiggly. But I wanted to make sure so I\u2019ve been weighing them.\n\nI noticed quickly that a few were dropping in weight very slightly, and some of the others weren\u2019t gaining. They\u2019re not sick, and she\u2019s been nursing them constantly, but they had a few small scuffles trying to eat which means 1 ends up left out every grooming time. She rotated them and cleans the left out one when this happens, but it was definitely a concern. \n\nI had purchased kitten formula when I found out how many there were, and just in case she didn\u2019t nurse. So I\u2019ve been offering them some formula + weighing them every 3-4 hours. Since I started doing this they\u2019ve all resumed weight gain, even though they all don\u2019t usually drink much. \n\nI posted a video of me holding one on my Instagram, and my cousin was pissed at me for holding them. Their mother spazzes when I weigh them (they cry a lot) and she told me it was inhumane since I was stressing out the mama cat and it might cause her to reject the babies. \n\nI told her she was an idiot and it\u2019s fine, since they all settle back down quickly once I put them back, and the mama cat definitely waits until I go in there to use the litter box / eat / drink so someone can watch them. \n\nShe\u2019s since been spamming me telling I\u2019m going to hurt them, that the mama cat can feed them just fine without human intervention, and such. She also commented on a post I put out looking for homes when they\u2019re big enough that I\u2019m going to kill the kittens at 2 weeks, since \u201cthat\u2019s when I\u2019m going to give them away\u201d even though it will definitely be 8 weeks or later. \n\nShe\u2019s offered to take them off my hands to give them to a \u201cvet friend\u201d but I don\u2019t trust her and told her no. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything particularly wrong but a few family members have told me I\u2019m overreacting and there are always runty ones and I shouldn\u2019t be touching them if it bothers the mama cat.

It\u2019s worth easing up if she is really freaked, since she was a stray and doesn\u2019t have trust for you. Make sure to speak in a soothing tone, not take them out of her eyeline or reach, and give her treats.

Keep holding and interacting with kittens if you plan to adopt them out, they need to feel comfortable with people and the first window for kitten learning and socialization is small and usually ends before 8 weeks.

They were preemies and passed within a few hours. Several days later I realized momma was actually STILL pregnant but labour has stopped after she had delivered the first 3, felt 0 movement from the kittens so I booked it to the vet for an emergency csection/spay (may as well be open, may as well spay her at the same time), the vet removed the dead kittens, but found 1 tiny little guy still alive by some miracle. (A cat's uterus is 2 \"tubes\" connected at the vaginal canal in a Y shape, what happened is the premature kittens came from 1 side, while the rest on the other side didn't trigger labour as the first ones were stillborn). \n\nI ended up bottle feeding the kitten for about a week around the clock as momma was too weak to care for him (when I found her she was emaciated and near death, the fact she was pregnant on top of that then getting a C-section was almost too much for her). At the end of the week she came up to me as I was about to feed him and turned on her side and gave me a look that fully said \"I'll take over from here\" and I put him by her and she started nursing him and took over his care. You could tell she was grateful that I became a \"foster momma cat\" while she recovered. \n\nI am also a former vet tech and have worked in rescue. I have dealt with more litters of kittens from stray/feral momma cats than I should of (we often had 6-8 litters at a time in the building). We handled them all within minutes of finding them after momma gave birth (they usually did in the night when we weren't there), we swapped momma's if needed (large litter we'd try to move 1-2 to a momma that had less), supplemented if they didn't gain weight and had no nursing mom's on hand or they rejected them (I have had many many sleepless nights as they feed every 2 hours round the clock as newborns). They were fine. Aim to weigh them right beside momma (like bring the scale to her vs bringing the kittens to the scale) and if she really didn't want you to touch them, you'd need protective gear to get near them as she'd attack.", "Two things.

The only thing I would say is that if you are weighing them every 3 to 4 hours, that's more often than you need to. Once, or at most twice a day, is enough, and would make it a bit less stressful for mom. Supplementing kittens or puppies when you have a large litter is better for the babies and the mom .

You sound like a very caring person who is helping, I will warn you tho that there is a thing called failing kitten syndrome, i would look into it just incase.

Multiple I contacted saying I would pay their fees, said I would foster them and buy food and supplies out of my own pocket but asked if they would please (after the vet services) put them up for adoption on their pages, they would even get an adoption fee. These places started to piss me off actually, unfortunately my toddler was getting a rash so I bought the lowest age and weigh treatment I could and found out it was rebranded after deaths, mind you it was the most expensive too $98 a box, costing $200. If you need to adopt them out just join a FB group when they\u2019re old enough if none of these places respond.

Supplemental bottle feeding and monitoring their weight is the perfect response. Just make sure you're using actual kitten formula as opposed to pet milk, and that you don't squeeze the bottle when you're feeding them because you can accidentally drown them.\n\nThere's a common misconception that handling kittens will make the mother reject them, but that is absolutely not true. In fact, it's actually a good idea to handle feral kittens from a very young age if you can get them away from Mama without losing a finger, because it makes taming them much less stressful on them in the long run.  It allows them to get used to the smell and feel of humans. If you can handle them before they open their eyes, even better. \n\nMama may not like it at first, but cats are smart. She'll probably yell at you and try to defend her babies the first few times, but after she realises that you take them and return them without hurting them, she'll start to chill out.

I've fostered feral moms who tolerated being inside and tolerated me but definitely were never going to be friendly pets. I've handled their newborn babies. Wash your hands and respect mom and you'll be fine. But also keep in mind that sometimes you will lose a kitten due to aspiration and/or subsequent pneumonia, sometimes it's a cleft palate or other deformity.

She's invaluable and I learned everything from her including how to weigh and track their weight, proper safe way to position and hold the kitten while giving them the bottle to avoid aspiration, keeping eye on momma for signs of infection (my first feral mom cat got surprisingly friendly with me while she was high on birth hormones those first few weeks. Until I tried to put her in a carrier to take her to the vet for a checkup. I have a permanent scar on my leg from her lol. But it was worth it because she had a very early uterine infection brewing).  \n   \nIt's possible mom is just not producing enough it happens to humans too even when they try everything. If you're not already doing so, go to the pet store and get \"mother and baby\" wet food by Royal Canin, or another trusted brand of KITTEN wet food. The kitten formula is also fed to post partum mother's while they are breast feeding. It has a ton more nutrition and calories than normal cat food.

For example: https://www.thedodo.com/videos/daily-dodo/heartbroken-cat-nurses-litter-of-puppies", "When our barn cat had kittens, I searched how to properly care for them. It's *recommended* to weight the kittens to make sure they're growing properly, and also recommended to touch them often to get them used to humans handling them. Also the more time you spend with them, the more the mother cat will learn to get used to you and trust you.\n\nSo NTA at all. \n\nBtw if you had done absolutely nothing and had left a small one to just die, that would be against the animal protection laws in my country. One must do their best to help an injured or sick animal, and if an animal is suffering beyond help, they must be humanely put down. Failure to do so (especially intentionally) is animal abuse. \n\nAlso it has been a law for about the last 15 years that kittens should stay with their mother for 12 weeks. About two years back the Cat Union (direct translation, it's what our official cat breeding union is called \ud83d\ude06) informed that the new recommendation is 14 weeks. The longer the kittens stay with they mom and sibling, the more \"cat manners\" they learn, thus they become more confident, and are less likely to have behavioral issues in their new homes. \n\nIssues like clawing/attacking your feet, not properly using the litter box etc. are often the result of kittens being given to new homes when they were too young. \n\nSo I would recommend waiting for them to be at least 12 weeks old. It will benefit them in the long run.\n\nAlso I just have to say that you are such an amazing person for taking them in, and giving them such good care! \n\nI hope you would take them to a vet to get them checked and microchipped, that way you can also get their price up. It's best to not give them away for free or for just a small sum. The more they cost, the more people will actually think before they just decide to get a cute kitten.

So I often dont have a super close relationship with the mother before she has her kittens. Weve had over 75 kitties through our home, with most being young kittens.\n\nI *always* weigh twice a day until they're 6 weeks and fully weaned. This has literally saved the lives of many kittens because a weight drop is the first sign of problems, and little ones are so fragile.\n\nIf theyre tiny, or seem to be having a harder time, I weigh them 3 to 4 times a day.\n\nAnd I've done it with feral mothers too - with some safety precautions. Lol\n\nYoure absolutely doing the right thing by carefully monitoring and giving extra feedings. And block your rude cousin who has no idea what she's talking about.\n\nKitten Lady on youtube has excellent advice on raising kittens, with or without a momma.

Your vet wouldn\u2019t have said anything because it\u2019s not a big deal in that regard. Human owners can have very strong feelings about it but it\u2019s harder on the humans than the cat! At under a year it was far safer and healthier for her to be spayed despite pregnancy than to try to give birth; she was just too little.

Weigh them and supplement if needed. \n\nYou know what Mom will be doing in threeweeksish? She'll be settled in, less freaked out, probably recognize you as safety, and be like OMG PLEASE BABYSIT I'M EXHAUSTED!\n\nI've seen fostering. One Mom jumped up on the kitchen island and meowed at the foster that it was her turn. Another loved bottle feeding because she could get a nap in.

The only argument for under 12 weeks is \"we want them when they're small and cute\"\n\nOther than that, OP is doing exactly what any experienced kitten foster would do. Handling newborn kittens is good for them. It exposes them to different stimuli and gentle pushing of boundaries increases distress tolerance. That's how you get adult cats that aren't nervous wrecks", "Info - why are you weighing every 3 or 4 hours? \n\nMake sure you keep them warm. They can\u2019t generate their own heat and taking them away from the mother causes their temperature to drop quickly. Also 10 to 12 weeks is a better age to give them away, but secure homes long before then. You sound like you have good intentions but I really think you should call your vet and have them talk you through how to care for the kittens because they are very vulnerable at that age. Check with your vet how you should be cleaning the kitten formula bottles and bedding too because harsh chemicals can mess up their tiny little organs.
