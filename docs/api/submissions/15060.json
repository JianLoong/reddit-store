She was heavily pregnant and the soonest I could get her in to have her spayed was post when she would have had them, so they were not removed and she had them just a few days ago. \n\nShe had a particularly large litter and is a smaller cat. The birth itself went fine, she passed the placenta, and they\u2019re all healthy, happy, and wiggly. But I wanted to make sure so I\u2019ve been weighing them.\n\nI noticed quickly that a few were dropping in weight very slightly, and some of the others weren\u2019t gaining. They\u2019re not sick, and she\u2019s been nursing them constantly, but they had a few small scuffles trying to eat which means 1 ends up left out every grooming time. She rotated them and cleans the left out one when this happens, but it was definitely a concern. \n\nI had purchased kitten formula when I found out how many there were, and just in case she didn\u2019t nurse. So I\u2019ve been offering them some formula + weighing them every 3-4 hours. Since I started doing this they\u2019ve all resumed weight gain, even though they all don\u2019t usually drink much. \n\nI posted a video of me holding one on my Instagram, and my cousin was pissed at me for holding them. Their mother spazzes when I weigh them (they cry a lot) and she told me it was inhumane since I was stressing out the mama cat and it might cause her to reject the babies. \n\nI told her she was an idiot and it\u2019s fine, since they all settle back down quickly once I put them back, and the mama cat definitely waits until I go in there to use the litter box / eat / drink so someone can watch them. \n\nShe\u2019s since been spamming me telling I\u2019m going to hurt them, that the mama cat can feed them just fine without human intervention, and such. She also commented on a post I put out looking for homes when they\u2019re big enough that I\u2019m going to kill the kittens at 2 weeks, since \u201cthat\u2019s when I\u2019m going to give them away\u201d even though it will definitely be 8 weeks or later. \n\nShe\u2019s offered to take them off my hands to give them to a \u201cvet friend\u201d but I don\u2019t trust her and told her no. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything particularly wrong but a few family members have told me I\u2019m overreacting and there are always runty ones and I shouldn\u2019t be touching them if it bothers the mama cat.

It\u2019s worth easing up if she is really freaked, since she was a stray and doesn\u2019t have trust for you. Make sure to speak in a soothing tone, not take them out of her eyeline or reach, and give her treats.

Keep holding and interacting with kittens if you plan to adopt them out, they need to feel comfortable with people and the first window for kitten learning and socialization is small and usually ends before 8 weeks.

They were preemies and passed within a few hours. Several days later I realized momma was actually STILL pregnant but labour has stopped after she had delivered the first 3, felt 0 movement from the kittens so I booked it to the vet for an emergency csection/spay (may as well be open, may as well spay her at the same time), the vet removed the dead kittens, but found 1 tiny little guy still alive by some miracle. (A cat's uterus is 2 \"tubes\" connected at the vaginal canal in a Y shape, what happened is the premature kittens came from 1 side, while the rest on the other side didn't trigger labour as the first ones were stillborn). \n\nI ended up bottle feeding the kitten for about a week around the clock as momma was too weak to care for him (when I found her she was emaciated and near death, the fact she was pregnant on top of that then getting a C-section was almost too much for her). At the end of the week she came up to me as I was about to feed him and turned on her side and gave me a look that fully said \"I'll take over from here\" and I put him by her and she started nursing him and took over his care. You could tell she was grateful that I became a \"foster momma cat\" while she recovered. \n\nI am also a former vet tech and have worked in rescue. I have dealt with more litters of kittens from stray/feral momma cats than I should of (we often had 6-8 litters at a time in the building). We handled them all within minutes of finding them after momma gave birth (they usually did in the night when we weren't there), we swapped momma's if needed (large litter we'd try to move 1-2 to a momma that had less), supplemented if they didn't gain weight and had no nursing mom's on hand or they rejected them (I have had many many sleepless nights as they feed every 2 hours round the clock as newborns). They were fine. Aim to weigh them right beside momma (like bring the scale to her vs bringing the kittens to the scale) and if she really didn't want you to touch them, you'd need protective gear to get near them as she'd attack.", "Two things.

The only thing I would say is that if you are weighing them every 3 to 4 hours, that's more often than you need to. Once, or at most twice a day, is enough, and would make it a bit less stressful for mom. Supplementing kittens or puppies when you have a large litter is better for the babies and the mom .

You sound like a very caring person who is helping, I will warn you tho that there is a thing called failing kitten syndrome, i would look into it just incase.

Multiple I contacted saying I would pay their fees, said I would foster them and buy food and supplies out of my own pocket but asked if they would please (after the vet services) put them up for adoption on their pages, they would even get an adoption fee. These places started to piss me off actually, unfortunately my toddler was getting a rash so I bought the lowest age and weigh treatment I could and found out it was rebranded after deaths, mind you it was the most expensive too $98 a box, costing $200. If you need to adopt them out just join a FB group when they\u2019re old enough if none of these places respond.

But she\u2019s an all indoor cat now, so barring any escapes, we should be golden. \n\nShe mostly cries and she did scratch me, but it was trying to climb up me and she slipped rather then intentional.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m definitely adopting them out! 8 cats is wayyyy too many - honestly since she gave birth I\u2019ve been extra sniffly (I\u2019m allergic to cats) \n\nDo you foster a lot of kittens? I\u2019ve kinda always wanted to foster cats / have a kitten nursery. The only thing really holding me back is the allergies.", "I wouldn\u2019t trust her with a plant tbh \ud83d\ude05", "I\u2019m keeping her! She\u2019s really darling and gets along okay with my dog. She\u2019s also quite affectionate, and playful when she feels like it.

Big difference between a vet and foster for animals, if that was the norm a lot of animals would be screwed.", "you have no idea what you\u2019re talking about!\n\n[here](http://www.kittenlady.org/mama) is a great guide from kitten lady about caring for a nursing mother and her babies\nu/cherries_sakura", "Agreed. 3-4 hours weigh ins is excessive and definitely stressing the mother out.", "They\u2019re in a plastic bin atm so I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll get a bit before that becomes a problem", "What would she do with that many cats though? It\u2019s nearly impossible to make a profit off them. They\u2019re mostly non standard colors but kittens are a dime a dozen around here, and will cost more in food then you\u2019ll get back in rehoming fees. They\u2019re also really kinda boring atm and more cleaning then you\u2019d think (I\u2019m swapping out blankets in the wash rn since they pee and poop on them)", "It\u2019s because they\u2019re meowing, it\u2019s natural, ppl get snotty about things they think they know. Momma cats respond to kittens crying and all cats get stressed when they\u2019re picked up, even kittens. Momma trusts you and she would literally hid them and hiss at you if she didn\u2019t,", "We had a mama cat who moved her kittens several times when they were really little. She evidently trusted the dog to help her carry them to their new place. We'd see her with a kitten in her mouth, and right behind her would be the dog carrying a kitten for her. She never rejected any of her kittens.", "You're doing a great job! You can always put a washcloth down in the pan and that'll make it more comfy.

The whole reject babies thing is a myth (there are a few who would but it's incredibly rare almost unheard of ) as long as both momma and babies are healthy and doing okay your golden. Beware though she will try to escape to catch mice and thing to teach the babies to hunt since that's likely the way she was taught it's not a fun experience waking up to a bunch of kittens chasing a screaming mouse \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "I try not to be paranoid, but maybe I've read too much Reddit here - but I can't help but wonder if this cousin or her Tinder \"vet\" might be able to get into your home at all to take them, and if you have any cameras up?", "She sounds like a sweetheart - it can take them a while to quite get all their legs back under control after giving birth so little slips are normal. I think you\u2019re doing a great job if she\u2019s trying to climb on you. Don\u2019t let your cousin\u2019s drama get you down!", "I had an indoor female kitten who was about 10 months old.  I was going to go to the vet but I wasn't worried about her getting knocked up because she wasn't allowed outside.  Turns out she jumped off my 3rd floor balcony.  Came back a week and a half later knocked up and full of worms.  Went immediately to the vet.  Got rid of everything.  I'm wasn't trying to be cruel but the last thing I needed was a litter of kittens in my small apartment and contributing to the many unwanted cats already out there.", "What a needlessly unpleasant thing to say.", "Kitten fosterer here too. Kittens tend to shed less of the allergic response protein, so usually they don't trigger as strongly a reaction. Maybe it's mom grooming them all (the protein is found in saliva) and you're handling them after that's causing an extra reaction? You can try wearing rubber gloves. \n\nAside from that, you are doing an excellent job supporting mom. Weighing them daily is exactly what you should do - it may stress her a little to hear them crying but if she's fine outside of that then there's no problem. Your cousin is demented.\n\nAny rescue or shelter would be lucky to have such a caring and mindful foster like you!!", "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Does she have a name yet?", "Thank you! \ud83e\udd70 They look very happy and well-cared for.

She even mentions weighing them daily in case they need to be supplemented too! I think the only bump I had on this list was she didn\u2019t like the covered bed and had then originally in the litter box, but given how many \u201ctoilet baby\u201d stories I\u2019ve heard over the years, seems valid.", "Thank you, I was honestly shocked when I saw how many NTA comments there were", "It\u2019s emotional , she\u2019s jealous", "That\u2019s absolutely adorable. She\u2019s weird with my dog - will go right up to her, sniff her, and then swat at her. \n\nShe also attempted to have her kittens in the litter box so we actually had to move them into a box already.", "We had a cat that would drop her kittens off with one of our dogs to watch. We joked that she was a hard working single mom and needed a break!!! The dog would already get this look of \u201cwhat the heck are these and why are they in my care?\u201d She would try to push them away but then she would relax when they started making biscuits on her, that part of babysitting she loved! After an hour or so, mama would come back and pick the kids up!", "I wash my hands before and after, but maybe. Tbh I figure it\u2019s a combination of them + doing laundry (washer is in the same room as them) + landscaping mowed recently + spring. \n\nI do have some spare gloves from work that I can use to test that out though \n\nAnd thank you!", "[removed]", "That's awesome!!!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Mama cat just looked at the dog, slapped her across the nose and hissed. Dog never tried to take them back to her after that. Poor dog was baby trapped with kids that weren\u2019t even hers!!! Those kittens became her buddies as they got older and they would all sleep together. \n\nIt was also funny that the cat would never take the babies to our derpy dog. It\u2019s like mama knew this dog was super dumb and didn\u2019t want that around her kids! This dog was the kind to get stuck in a paper bag or think she was stuck outside even with the door wide open\u2026"]}
