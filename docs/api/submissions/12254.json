Yours will thrive with just you, and you have my permission to tell your extended family that they will also thrive with ONLY you and NOT the extended family if the extended family doesn't knock it off with the unwanted advice and grossly intrusive matchmaking.", "NTA. Lots of kids grow up with only one parent. It's not at all necessarily debilitating.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHonestly, that your fam thinks any person marrying a parent will automatically be a parental figure to the children sounds worrisome, IMO.", "NTA you have to do what is right for you.  If you feel the desire to go meet someone else, you will, but until then, they all need to leave you alone.  Just because they've done it in the past?  So what?  Lots of things that were done in the past aren't done anymore.  Tell them you're starting a new tradition of being an adult who can make their own decisions.\n\nI'm very sorry for your loss, and commend you for knowing what you do and don't want.", "NTA. Your life not theirs.", "Well meaning and concerned doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t obnoxious and toxic.  You are NTA.  No one should tell you when it is time to move on, you will know.  Go LC for a while until they can learn boundaries.", "NTA\n\nGrief is incredibly personal. I lost my husband, also suddenly, also from an undiagnosed heart condition, coming up on 5 years. I had to threaten to cut people off to make them stop trying to set me up, or tell me that I needed to \"get over it\". He was, he always will be my everything.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being a single parent. Don't let anyone tell you how to grieve. I would promise to go NC if they persist. I'm so sorry that they won't just let you be.", "NTA \n\nYour family needs to stay in their lane, which is NOT your love life.", "NTA but dear god I think your family has bad luck and/or is cursed with keeping life partners.

If that strategy genuinely worked out best for them, then good for them. But they\u2019re them and you\u2019re you. You have the final say when it comes to your grief, your love life, and your children. You\u2019re not being rude. They\u2019re being judgemental and not respecting your boundaries, and you are standing up for yourself. If it were me, I would tell them we can stop talking about this or we can stop talking completely.", "NTA and it's none of their business. If you choose to never date or remarry that's fine! My mom has been widowed for 22 years and only ever dated once about 15 years ago. She's perfectly content on her own and lives a full life. Sometimes I wish she'd meet someone but she's not interested and I respect that. My grandmother also never dated or remarried after my grandfather died when my mom was 15. Grief and loss of a spouse is so individual and it's no one else's business how you choose to move past this.", "NTA, you have listened. They have not", "NTA", "NTA. I am sorry for your traumatic loss. Your own decision is the best one you can make.", "NTA. Telling people it\u2019s unhealthy to be single is an asshole move, and having kids doesn\u2019t change that. There are so many ways in which dating could be unhealthy for your kids, and it sounds like your little family has what it needs. You may wish to find another romantic partner someday, and you may not.\n\nI will say that I hope you have built a support system that isn\u2019t these family members, because you may need to take a step back if they won\u2019t. Best wishes to you and your kids - it sounds like you\u2019re doing as well as possible.", "NTAH, you're parents/family aren't going to change, you might consider cutting them out of your life.  I cut my family out of my life at age 27 (I'm a 63/m) because every single issue my whole life turns into a huge fight with drama every single day.  Either cut back seeing them dramatically or cut them out.  You don't need the added drama after losing your spouse.", "NTA\n\nWhat is this it\u2019s not healthy to stay single business?\n\nThey are being weird and pushy. There\u2019s also no guarantee even a young child would be agreeable to a new parent - young kids still have their own opinions and thoughts.\n\nIt\u2019s also not okay to treat you like a prop for your children, pressuring you to be in a (presumably) romantic and sexual relationship with someone. It\u2019s also unfair to the other person.\n\nTragedy happens.\n\nTrying to harrass people in to sexual and romantic relationships is not the answer.\n\nIf people ignore a polite no, eventually they are going to get a rude one - *because they aren\u2019t respecting your polite no*.\n\nYou aren\u2019t being unreasonable, and you have no obligation to follow their orders. \n\nChildren *do* need support systems, including adults who aren\u2019t their parents - your family can focus on that by being there for the kids, instead of trying to outsource it to a new replacement dad.", "Their concern isn't concern, it's them trying to tell you how to live your life.

Where do your family get off telling you what is \"normal\" or not? You do you. If you don't want to re-date/marry, don't. If you do, you'll decide and know if and when that happens.", "You can and should do whatever you know is best for you in this life. You don\u2019t need two people to raise happy, healthy, well-loved kids. You want them to take in your strength and learn from that\u2026 not what it\u2019s like to settle. \n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA!! Firstly, I am so sorry for your loss. I can\u2019t even imagine. Everyone processes grief differently and at their own pace. It\u2019s completely normal for you to not want to be romantically involved with anyone right now. You\u2019re also not doing your children a disservice. Yes, it is important that children have a safe and encouraging support system, but they don\u2019t need 2 parents to have that. Your family should spend more time building relationships with your kids and becoming trustworthy supports if they\u2019re so worried about what they may be \u201cmissing out on\u201d. You never have to have a relationship again if you don\u2019t want. And if you do, you do it on your terms. You are human before you are a mother. You should be able to be in love with your partner if you ever choose to have one. Dating or marrying someone just so your kids have them as a role model is a disservice to YOU and YOUR heart. The kids aren\u2019t the only ones suffering as a result of the passing of your husband, and I\u2019m so sorry that your family refuses to recognize that.", "NTA - my mom heard \"you need a father for your daughter\" so she let herself be talked into dating and then marrying a man she was introduced to by friends/family.\n\nHe had mental health issues which appeared after the marriage. That was when she learned that his first wife had committed s****** and it was a common reaction of HIS famiy/friends that this was due to his actions during the marriage. The actions he was repeating with my mom. Who was rightfully infuriated with these supposed friends who said (apparently) that they figured my mom was stronger and so it would be 'different this time'.\n\nNot doing what someone wants you do to is not throwing their concern back in their face. It's not doing what they want. If their concern can only be expressed by trying to control you ... they aren't really that concerned.", "Not the AH & I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re being forced to deal with this while still mourning.", "You are a strong model for your kids. They are way out of line and thats clearly toxic.\n\nNTA", "After reading so many AITA posts of men who want to replace dad's (women to, but this is about her remarrying), and the trauma it causes, I say you do you. \nIf my husband had died, I doubt I would have remarried.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but I think it's time to be clear that at any future family events if this comes up you and the kids will be leaving straightaway. And that they have a limited number of chances before you stop bothering to show up at all.", "NTA, and I completely understand. My husband died eight years ago. Our children were older teenagers at the time. I have chosen not to date or marry again. My children had a father, one that they got so spend a lot of time with growing up. They don\u2019t need another. Tell them to mind their own business until they get the point.", "NTA. How you raise your kids, grieve your loss and manage your love life is no one\u2019s business but yours. \n\nI lost my mom when I was 5. My dad has not been on one date in 18 years, despite his entire church throwing women at him. I\u2019m fine. He\u2019s fine.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, it's monstrous that they admitted to believing you should erase your late husband. Saying your kids were passed the point of easily accepting a new husband was more or less a self-report in that regard.", "NTA, no one can tell you how long to grieve.  Take time away from them. Go no contact for a while and enjoy your children. Make memory books for each of them with photos of their dad and stories about him.  Turn to his family, friends and co-workers for stories.  When and if you are ready then look for someone on your own.  Parents setting you up with the perfect mate is archaic and degrading.", "NTA. Grief has no expiration date. Some people never remarry and some do it fairly quickly. Neither is wrong. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss", "NTA - thank you for thinking of your kids enough to know that you are not ready instead of rotating men in and out of their lives while you find the one", "NTA. It\u2019s absolutely none of their business. Tell them if they bring it up again you won\u2019t be communicating with them at all. And then stick by that", "NTA.", "Is there a reason so many of your family member\u2019s spouses die? That\u2019s a lot of remarrying", "NTA! Like others have said, everyone grieves differently and pushing you to find another spouse is awful. You and your children are still healing, and that takes time. \n\nI'm sorry for yours and children's loss.", "NTA. Know who is a big risk to your kid? A stepfather. Higher risk of abuse or murder.

Because that's a lot of deaths", "But this isn\u2019t about grief which implies that it\u2019s temporary.  She simply doesn\u2019t want another relationship.  Period.  She may never want another.  That\u2019s her business.  No one is obligated to pair up.  She may be quite content to remain single and raise her children alone.", "Grief can last someone's whole life. So far, I've only lost my dad and my grandma & grandpa. I still miss my dad every day. It's better, because I can talk about it to other people, but it's still there. I still cry about it. I accept that it's just going to be there. I can't imagine losing my spouse in a traumatic way. It would wreck me, and I wouldn't want to have another relationship. I've already met the person I want to spend my life with.", "How is op even supposed to respond to this", "Good point, but I feel like when you're posting all your information on the internet, you should be prepared to face rather direct/pointed questions.\n\nEspecially when there's details like that- that's 4 deaths (outside of OP's husband) within 3 generations (I'm assuming), where the children were young, in order for this to have some sort of traditional way to handle this? That's odd.", "Found another ah"]}
