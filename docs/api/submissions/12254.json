Everyone has different periods of grief, so if you think you don't want a new partner yet, then that's your decision. If your family just wants you to have a new man, just to have a father for the kids, it most likely will not happily ever after, but in a break up.", "NTA  Next time somebody wants to say something to you about it tell them, \"I realize you're jealous because I had a spouse that was so wonderful they are irreplaceable but you really need to get over it.\" Then turn and walk away.", "NTA.  With minor children, it\u2019s important that they have strong role models of different genders in their life, but nothing says that has to be their parent\u2019s spouse.  I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re female (forgive me if I\u2019m wrong!), so you\u2019d want to make sure they had steady, active male presences in their life in addition to your strong presence\u2026but that can take so many forms!

If you never are, then good for you for knowing yourself and trusting your own knowledge of yourself and your needs.  In this day and age, there\u2019s no need to marry a second partner \u201cfor the child\u2019s sake\u201d - that was only remotely needed back when it was basically impossible for a single parent to keep a child housed and cared for.  One of the advantageous of modern conveniences is that they give us options, more ways to live happy, healthy lives than our ancestors did.\n\nPushing potential partners at you is tasteless and rude.  The only time this kind of matchmaking is cool is when someone literally asks for it - as in, tells their family that they want them to bring potential partners around like yours is doing.\n\nThe fact that your other family members remarried quickly is irrelevant.  It\u2019s not what you want or need, so they need to lay off.", "NTA\n\nPlease be very carefull with your familie and keep the kids according to theyre age informed how you think.", "Definitely NTA.

Your family are terrible role models if they think you need to start hooking up with randos for the benefit of your children. That's creepy.\n\nStay away and don't look back.

One loving parent is more than many kids get -- even those born into a two parent household.\n\nYou're allowed to throw concern trolling in people's faces, which is what they are doing to you.

If you find the right person, and treat your kids with respect, then go for it. But no good ever came from blindly copying what other people think will make your life complete.\n\nYou're doing great.
