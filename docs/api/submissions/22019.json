Dads friend who I\u2019ll call \u201cSteve\u201d: 54m\n\nSo my parents love to host friend and family gatherings. They have a big house and sometimes they invite old friends they haven\u2019t seen for a while for a few nights. One of these friends is Steve who imo is a a-hole. Ex military and uses that as an excuse for everything. He\u2019s an asshole to a waiter? He used to be military so he has to have things in the right order and how DARE he get offered a free bread basket without asking for one. You\u2019re 10 and call his kid a nickname (think \u201cmax\u201d as short for Maxine)? Enjoy lectures on respect and decorum because he\u2019s military (all these actually happened). He\u2019s also very homophobic because (you guessed it) he\u2019s military.\n\nSo my parents had old friends and family members over this weekend including steve, I\u2019m not in touch with a lot of my family but I\u2019m open about being gay on social media which Steve doesn\u2019t use, (barring Facebook but I don\u2019t have him on there) so a few people knew I had a girlfriend at least.\n\nWhile eating the topic of pride month came up, Steve instantly launched into a rant about it and how awful it was, and about every negative stereotype about the LGBT community you can imagine. He then started commenting on my hair and appearance saying I needed to be careful I didn\u2019t \u201c start to look like a lesbian\u201d before claiming that all lesbians just hate men and they need a good one to sort them out and more BS.\n\nAbout 10mins later my gf came into the kitchen while steve was still going. I immediately said \u201chi babe!\u201c and kissed her before introducing her to Steve as my girlfriend. \n\nMost people had been either politely nodding or had moved away from Steve during his rant but pretty much everybody in the room had gone quiet and where awkwardly looking between me, my parents, and Steve I sat down next to my gf and encouraged Steve to carry on with what he was saying. He went red in the face before loudly claiming I \u201cset him up\u201d and called me a spiteful cow. I just smiled and told him if his opinions where embarrassing him that wasn\u2019t my problem.\n\nHe stayed after that but spent most of the party justifying/ backtracking over the bigoted things he\u2019d said. He left after my uncle made fun of him for getting shown up and said that would teach him to stop commandeering conversations (which he does a lot). \n\nMy parents cornered me afterwards and said I was \u201crude and petty\u201d and that I should\u2019ve said I had a girlfriend as soon as the topic came up to avoid embarrassing other people for their opinions or should\u2019ve told my gf to wait until the conversation moved on to come down. \n\nMy dad is saying Steve won\u2019t even speak to him without an apology from me and my gf meaning the gaming sessions they have every week online are now awkward for him as his friends keep pushing him to force an apology from me. \n\nAITA for how I embarrassed him?", "created_utc": 1689164872, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xn7bh/aita_for_setting_up_my_dads_homophobic_friend_for/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't believe he expects an *APOLOGY*, that is to laugh!!  NTA.", "NTA. He is a hateful bigot. He deserves every bit of embarrassment his hateful bigotry causes him. And your parents should be ashamed for asking you to apologize. And for keeping him around as a friend", "NTA\n\nWhy does your dad want to remain friends with someone who was openly homophobic to his daughter?", "NTA. Loud bigots gonna bigot loudly.   This time he embarrassed himself. Good enough. He can pound sand and get over himself, which he should be used doing from when he used to be in the military. He should have learned how to shut the fuck up and have some respect while he was there too, you\u2019d think.\n\nYou owe NOBODY an apology, and your dad needs to seriously consider why he would be friendly with someone who thinks that way about his daughter. Getting big AH vibes from dad, asking you to eat crow so he can keep playing video games with his loser bigot friend.", "\u201cYou existing made me feel bad because I was saying you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to exist, so if you could apologize to me because now I look stupid because I was saying stupid things, that would be great.\u201d  \n  \nOh, NTA.", "NTA - you didn't do anything. you just existed and allowed other to voice their opinion(s) no matter how hateful it was. you even enouraged him to continue.. you didn't want to oppress anyone.\n\nIMO, your parents are as much a problem as their friend. For their belief, their friendship, and for blaming you instead of supporting you.", "So Steve is only capable of homophobia when not actually talking to or in front of a member of the LGBTQ? How is it your fault that his conviction isn't strong enough to say it to a lesbian? Why are you responsible for ensuring he only speaks his mind when he has reason to believe everybody around him will agree with him? How, exactly, would this apology work? Do you apologize for being gay? Do you apologize that he was permitted to express his opinion? Do you apologize that he's hateful and bigoted?", "NTA but let me tell you something very important you're the company you keep....birds of a feather.

Folks like him need a wake up call on their horrible behaviour. Your uncle sounds awesome to have in your corner. \n\nThere are a few things that are \ud83d\udea9though because your parents seem to want to keep this horrible human as their friend instead of sticking up for their daughter. So, I'd be questioning if your relationship is safe around them.\n\nIf your Dad really wanted to word his friend up, knowing what an A Grade AHole he is, he could have done so, but didn't.\n\nYou don't have to apologize to anyone. I think you did everyone a favour if he never shows his face again. \n\nStay awesome!", "NTA.\n\nIn fact, not only is Steve and AH, but both of your parents are too for remaining friends with such a bigot.\n\nLet your father know how embarrassing it is to have a friend like Steve and if Steve's friendship is more important than his daughter that you can honor that and never see him again.", "NTA. You didn't set him up, he was speaking his mind without reading the room or taking interest in the person he was conversing with.

If someone can be embarassed by his/her opinion, it probably means that opinion is garbage.\n\nSteve felt set up? He can't stand his opinion in from of someone being a target of his opinion? Looks like Steve is a coward on top of being an AH.", "NTA.  Your father has had countless opportunities to tell Steve that kis daughter is a lesbian.  He had just as much opportunity to stop Steve\u2019s rant as you did, and because he\u2019s Steve\u2019s friend and not LGBT, he faced a lower risk of Steve turning on him if asked to stop.  If anyone other than Steve can be blamed for not stopping Steve from making a fool of himself, your dad is a much better candidate than you are.\n\nIt\u2019s rather disgusting that your dad lets his friends talk about the LGBTQAI+ community, especially with you as his daughter, but it\u2019s beyond the pale that he\u2019s going along with yet another of Steve\u2019s dumbass moves in expecting you to apologize.", "NTA and I'm sorry to hear that your dad doesn't stand up for you.", "NTA.\n\nI'm active duty and he is one of the classic \"the military is my whole personality\" guys who were likely complete oxygen thieves during their service and got all gung-ho once they got out.

Your dad should be thanking you for getting Steve out of his life.", "NTA, the guy deserved to be embarrassed.  Incidentally, do you happen to know what he actually did in the military?  In my experience, the guys who are the loudest and most obnoxious about making sure everyone knew about their military background were guys who spent their whole tour behind a desk, or guarding the Green Zone Taco Bell.", "Former military here (Marine Corps). None of his behavior is actually because he served.  He just uses that to make people respect him when he\u2019s being a jerk.\nYour dad should absolutely have your back over this loser!  Somebody here is owed an apology, but it isn\u2019t Steve!", "NTA but your parents sure are. You didn't make Steve say anything, he showed his true colors freely. Your parents should be going no contact with this guy and that's letting him off easy.", "NTA.  Your dad is an AH for not having your back.  And Steve is for thinking he's entitled to voice bigoted nonsense.", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA and you handled it so well! Steve sounds like a real piece of work. I wonder why your parents let his bigotry slide? And it would he a cold day in hell before I apologized to an asshole like that, for the record.", "NTA, what did your parents want you to do? Stop this man in the middle of the rant like \u201cI\u2019m actually a lesbian\u201d like that wouldn\u2019t have had a similar reaction, or honestly, probably a worse reaction since he doesn\u2019t seem like the person that would stop his bigotry rant like that. I would have loved to be in the room the moment your gf walked in and this went down, I probably wouldn\u2019t have made the situation better bc knowing myself I would have laughed at him.\n\nDon\u2019t apologise to anyone.", "NTA and a true American hero!\n(if you're in the US, otherwise hero for the world)", "So why exactly did your parents invite a homophobic jackass over in the first place and why were they ok with his insulting homophobic tirade directed at their daughter?", "Steve just left his ass hanging out and got burned. Happens from time to time. So no, you are not TA. I think it was pretty slick actually!  \n\nSteve is being a petulant baby by 'punishing' your father for the actions of you and your girl. Nothing to do with your dad. If Steve wanted to sack up, he would talk to you directly.", "NTA. You didn't embarrass Steve.

I'm genuinly curious.", "Your dad is the AH.  My son is pan, and so help me if someone that was my \"friend\" started going on a homophobic rant, I'd knock them tf out.  I sure as shit wouldn't expect my son to apologize to him for his own damn homophobia.   Your dad really pissed me off.", "NTA and Steve should apologize.", "NTA - never apologize for being who you are. Steve should be apologizing to you and everyone else that he spewed his nonsense to. Every single person who is encouraging you to apologize is not your ally, and it doesn\u2019t seem they understand that. Being \u201cmilitary\u201d does not give you the right to be hateful .", "NTA. I find it very hard to understand what you should apologize.", "This is almost too perfect to be real lol, but if it is, NTA one bit!\n\nYou didn\u2019t set him up whatsoever nor did you embarrass him. You and your girlfriend (and myself) just dared existing, he did the rest all by himself like the \u201cbig, strong, cishet military man\u201d he is.", "Steve can dish them but can\u2019t take them. Also spending time with homophobic people is a waste of precious hours of life, you should tell your dad that.\n\nNTA, wish I could high five you.", "Your parents are cowards who are supporting a bigot over their own child. NTA", "NTA\n\nIf he feels embarassed telling his opinion, he should reconsider his opinion. You should ask your father what it says about him that he wants to coddle his friend when he embarassed himself and now tries to shove the guilt on you and your dad too.", "NTA\n\nWait, your dad is pushing you to apologize to his homophobic friend for letting him be homophobic in public because now he can't play a game in peace? His priorities are really fucked up.", "##NTA\n\nSteve set himself up.

So if anyone in this situation owes Steve an apology (which is a stretch) it\u2019s your Dad not you.", "NTA. The ex military thing is hilarious because I was a civilian contractor at a government job where over 50% of the staff were ex military, more than 10% of them were  out and proud!!

Steve put himself in timeout and can stay there even after he learns that he's an AH.", "Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences. This was a consequence. He'll probably have a few more come his way in his life. Maybe it will open his eyes or not.", "NTA. Why didn't your dad warn him before he came over that you have a girlfriend? He surely could have anticipated that Steve would act this way. I'm mad at your dad for even exposing you to Steve's bullshit and he owes you an apology. How he handles his relationship with Steve from now on is up to him and does not require that you pretend Steve is right.", "Steve\u2019s awfully thin skinned for being military.  He can suck it up.  NTA.  He\u2019s a big mouth, but not a big man.  His own words are what embarrassed him, not what you did.  Steve and your parents though are ah\u2019s.

If you were to scream and rant you would only be confirming to him what he already thinks.\n\nYou embarrassed the shit out of him and hurt his fragile military ego. Good job. He MAY actually decide to keep his mouth shut from now on. I doubt you\u2019ve changed his views but that\u2019s option B. Shut him up", "NTA. He made his bed, he can lay in it. \n\nAlso, I guess I have to say your parents ATA bcs they didn't immediately kick out a person that called their daughter a \"spiteful cow\" in front of them.", "NTA in any way, shape, or form like.. holy shit lmfaooooo you cooked his ass so hard with such ease that he'll probably recover socially but honestly he deserves that immensely\nEdit: also he absolutely does not deserve an apology at all. Kinda extremely messed up that they'd take his side here", "HAHAHA NO! \ud83d\ude18", "NTA.  You handled it beautifully and with class and style. \nYou may want to discuss with your parents this expectation that you apologize to Steve.  You have zero, nothing, nada for which you should apologize.  Emily Post couldn\u2019t find flaw with you.  Any blowhard that hijacks conversations and spews bigotry and hatred at a party shouldn\u2019t be getting an invitation.  Someone who verbally attacks and insults the host\u2019d daughter ought to be ejected.  If Mom was concerned about \u2018not embarrassing Steve\u2019 she could very well have pulled him aside to tell him he needed to keep those views to himself, given present company (or really, in ANY company).  Those are some points to cover with your parents to have them think about and hopefully readjust their stance on this issue.", "Tell your father is his gaming sessions are more Important that someone hating his daughter for whoever she is? If it is maybe is time to cut that part of your life really.", "NTA. Never apologize to that awful, awful person, and demand that your parents apologize to you for even suggesting it.", "Fuck bigots. I love seeing them get embarrassed. NTA", "NTA . But if your parents are siding up with steve calling you rude, then you should have a conversation with them because they should have your back  if they are not homophobic themselves.", "NTA. The trash bagged itself, then took itself out. Ask your folks why they are friends with a homophobe. To many of us, myself included, that is an instant friendship/relationship ender. Homophobia, transphobia, racism, religious bigotry, any other bigotry. If I find out, you'll be yeeted out of my life so fast your underdeveloped brain will rattle.", "NTA but like if there's a way to be even more NTA you're that\n\nSorry your parents feel the need to respect homophobia just because it's coming from someone they don't hate.\n\nIt's not YOUR fault he was a homophobe in public. It sucks that a lot of people act this way and pretend that it's just a difference of opinion, even though they know they have to find a safe space to be bigoted in.", "NTA you did not embarrass him, he was doing a pretty good job by himself.", "NTA. \n\nI'm sorry, your dad wants *you* to apologize to a man who was spewing hateful bigotry about your own community for *not immediately coming out to him*? When he was literally talking about corrective SA? Your dad needs to apologize to *you* for not stopping his friend from speaking that way around you and stop bringing Steve around you, wtf.", "NTA. According to Steve himself your hair and appearance was enough to let him know you are a lesbian so you already did 'inform' him.", "NTA, Steve screwed around and found out. But if your dad is this upset that his bigoted friend won\u2019t talk to him anymore I\u2019d say you should have a conversation with him about how his bigoted friend wanting an apology is more important than standing beside you", "So you\u2019re parents aren\u2019t going to say anything about the fact he not only was on an LGBT rant in front of you but called you names?\n\n\nNTA. You\u2019re enabling parents need a reality check", "NTA and so he's okay with hating gay people until it's done in front of a real life (GASP) gay person\n\nEdit for spelling", "Nta. Btw, if someone insulted MY daughter they would be banned from my house and no longer called my friend.", "Your dad sucks. Steve sucks.", "NTA, plus you did your dad a favour by getting Steve to friend-break-up or whatever", "Yes, you really went out of your way to be lesbian and have a girlfriend *just* to show him up. Had to play the long con, didn't you? /s\n\nNTA. And, Jesus, did your parents not defend you at all from their friend? That's not on.", "NTA. Why does your dad even want a friend who treats his daughter like that? I wouldn't want to associate with such a person in the first place.", "NTA I can\u2019t even understand how a normal person would think you\u2019re in the wrong.", "I don\u2019t recall any rules of etiquette stating anyone must soft-enter a room for the purpose of explaining who or how they have sex with, or to announce there may be differences between them and others in the room. This is just typical white straight male privilege that they deny exists.  Did Steve pre-announce he was straight? That he would be condemning others? Did others pre-announce they have a non-Caucasian spouse or parent ? Or that they are atheists? Does Steve expect them to? NTA and I might have dug a claw in a bit deeper, questioning Steve about his over compensating, and whether he might be a latent homosexual. Just to spice up the conversation, you understand.", "Although if I was at your place probably at the point where he warned you about starting to look like a lesbian", "That\u2019s the real issue. OP should ask her father if he\u2019s going to apologize for allowing his friend to insult his daughter and also force Steve.", "Her parents are absolutely the biggest a holes of this story. Her parents let him berate her in their house and apparently share in Steve\u2019s delusion that he\u2019s entitled to an apology. Straight up losers.", "That's a hella fair point too. I'm 99% sure any decent father would be like \"yeah no you are not coming around my family if you're going to act like a bigoted idiot\"", "I wrote the same thing before looking through all of the comments.", "THANK YOU!!!! If that had happened with my daughter, and maybe some day it will, I'da flipped the damn table over! You will NOT come into my child's space (their childhood home/my house will ALWAYS be THEIR space) and verbally attack her! In her 20's or not, I will have your ass for it! And if my husband acted like the dad in this case, I'd have his ass too!", "They care about Steve more then they do about OP. Sad. OP should go NC.", "\u201cYou think so?! Thank you!\u201d", "Totally. Dad is an AH here for sure. Was he assuming you were going to be \"considerate\" of Steve's fucked up opinions? If he didn't want his friend embarrassed, he had plenty of opportunities to kick him under the table and somehow let him know he was swimming in dangerous waters.\n\nFuck both those guys. I would be wondering what Dad's real opinion of his daughter's lifestyle really is.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t realize that my father\u2019s good friend was so uninvolved and uninterested in our family that he hadn\u2019t kept up with my relationship status. I thought he was being a bigot to my face because he is a homophobic AH, but now I realize that he was just an *ignorant* homophobic AH\u201d. NTA, and your father owns *you* an apology.", "It interesting how often that is the case. We had a principal once who insisted that our (the collegium) use of first names and even nicknames when we addressed each other as teachers was disrespectful and lowered our status in the eyes of the students. I quote: \u201cyou would never have survived on an American military base!\u201d \n\nThing is; we were in **Sweden**! The principal had never served even in the Swedish military (other than the obligatory basic training every man had to do when he was 20. He was now close to pension).  But by g*d was he using military references whenever he could! Me and my colleagues of course started calling each other \u201cHead teacher Larsson\u201d, \u201cProfessor Svensson\u201d, \u201cMagister Andersson\u201d and \u201cLecturer Johansson\u201d etc. making up more ridiculous titles as time progressed\u2026\ud83d\ude08\nThe students wondered what the heck was going on \ud83d\ude02\n\nI was reminded of this when I read about Steve\u2019s lecture about \u201crespect and decorum\u201d about names. Interesting enough, our principal was racist and homophobic as well\u2026", "Another vet (USN) chiming in to support \"it isn't the military that caused Steve's homophobia\", because that's absolutely true.  We're not taught how to be flaming AH's in boot camp or anything like that, it's just Steve demanding the respect given to military vets as a conditioned response to patriotism.  He's just a flaming AH.  OP is NTA.", "Yep. The nerve of talking about \u201crespect and decorum\u201d while simultaneously disrespecting people and showing no decorum whatsoever is\u2026 ironic.", "Get it", "If I was OP I\u2019d be concerned why her dad\u2019s bigoted friend refusing to talk to him until he gets an apology from them is more important than standing beside his daughter. If a friend of mine ever openly shit on my kid like that they wouldn\u2019t be a friend anymore"]}
