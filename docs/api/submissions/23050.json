A crop top & shorts for a teenage girl is a completely normal outfit for a girl her age. You handled the situation appropriately & removed you & your daughter from your sister's toxic behavior.

Religion is no excuse to comment on another persons choice of clothing especially if that person is not of the same religious beliefs as you. I am a Christian so I believe in dressing modestly because that is what the Bible.

Judaism has a strong and strict tradition of not only not imposing your religious practices on other people because consent without pressure is very, very important, but it has different views on modesty than other religions. Modesty in Judaism is called \"tznuit\", and it isn't supposed to be about just about the dress, the dress is just an outward signifier that you've adopted the practice, and it's mostly meant to be a practice for married adults within the confines of a marriage. Modest dress is supposed to signify a commitment to humility, gentleness, and restraint, and can go along with anything from not wanting to touch members of the opposite gender to the full Mike Pence of not wanting to be alone with them without your spouse present, though that's pretty extreme even in Orthodox Judaism. Most Orthodox Jews who practice tznuit will just, like, not want to shake hands with someone who isn't their gender and they aren't related to. \n\nWhat the OP's sister did is a far greater violation of the rules of tznuit than anything OP's daughter could possibly have worn - she was cruel, unrestrained in her judgment, and did this to a child. Judaism also takes the consent of children extremely seriously, which is the whole idea behind bar/bat mitzvahs, they're the point at which  children are considered old enough to begin to consent to all aspects of Judaism and make their own choices about how they choose to practice their faith. The rules of tznuit are explicitly clear that all this no touching and modest clothing stuff does not apply to children because you know, sometimes kids get messy! Imagine trying to dress a baby modestly or not letting your kid hug their friends because they happen to not be the same gender! That's extremely stupid! The tl;dr is that the OP's sister can be like blah blah my religion all she wants, but she's full of shit. The OP's daughter is 12.

Also the crop top wasn\u2019t even short", "Shorts and tank are not adult or revealing", "Why are you sexualizing children that wear clothes from the children's section of clothing stores?", "The answer is kind of yes and no? By true orthodox teaching and values, modesty is something important for EVERYONE, both women AND men to have, as it is a matter of respect for your community, yourself, and g-d. However, this is something that is enforced within community/by people practicing in the orthodox tradition, and more generally in orthodox spaces, not something that is meant to be enforced on others who exist outside of that system of belief or those spaces. It is not right for you to look down on non-jews, or jews who practice differently, for not dressing within the modesty rules of your orthodox community. Additionally, another thing that is considered important in jewish law especially talked about in orthodox spaces is that it is wrong to speak lashon hara (translates to \"evil tongue\", meaning speech that will cause someone harm either emotionally, physically, financially, etc. by law it does not actually matter if the speech is true or not, it is still wrong to cause harm in this way),  so regardless of what you personally believe about a person, it would be a great sin to go around telling people, or telling someone to their face, that they are a slutty temptress. Especially to a child, as you are not only speaking harm, but speaking harm to a child. This is not to say a lot of orthodox beliefs and law are not sexist, it is a society with very strict gender roles and expectations, however you are not meant to pick and choose which parts of jewish law you follow, and you are meant to participate because you believe the values you are being taught. \n\nNow all that said, this is the ideal that is intended by law. The reality is that a lot of orthodox jews, especially here in the states (I can't speak to anywhere else as I am from the US), are very judgemental conservative minded people in the same ways conservative christians are, and they both do and say a lot of hateful things to other people. Often people will pick and choose what they follow, and because many see the way they practice judaism as the only \"correct\" way to be jewish, and to be a religious jew, they look down on other people both in and out of the jewish community, and treat anyone who isn't like them as less than. Big holier than thou attitudes. Genuinely a big part of this is that the community is infected by the same group of far right influencers and think tanks that control the thought of evangelical christians and the like.\n\nThe source of my information is that I grew up in orthodox community, and was literally traumatized into leaving by people exactly like OPs sister. As an adult I have made so many orthodox friends who practice in good faith and see their path as, exactly that: their path. And there are many things that are part of orthodox community that I would love to see in other paths, like traditional prayer service (I don't like the hippie guitar playing services of more liberal movements, it just doesn't hit \ud83d\ude2d).

Popped a piece of fun in her mouth, chewed for a few minutes, and asked if anyone in the class wanted some. Because as the teacher must have been acutely aware, we women are objects! And our worth is determined by whether or not men like us! \n\nWhat she wasn't prepared for was one of the kids walking up and taking the gun from her. His logic was that we weren't allowed to chew gum in class but he really liked chewing, but hoo boy what a legend. Teacher didn't even respond in a meaningful way, which is surprising considering how would teenagers can be. She seriously hadn't come up with a contingency plan for smart asses?", "Nobody said anything about marrying...", "A lot of states also allow underage marriage\u2026", "I learned that it isn't a problem with 1st cousins having babies with defects often. According to someone I knew who married his 1st cousin, their geneticist told them the problem starts if their kids were to have kids with someone they are related to. \n\nI still wouldn't marry or have kids with a 1st cousin though. Too close of a relation for me.", "In most of the world, including about half of the US, it is not regulated.\n\nAs practiced in societies that accept it (like the UK) it doesn't happen often enough to have any detectable medical consequences.  That isn't where the taboo comes from in places like Idaho.  The fact that some US states decided to panic about it at the time of the Civil War is not coincidence.", "Brave of you to admit you think of 12yo\u2019s sexually, on the web, and that your religion excuses it.", "Do you often sexualize 12 year old girls? Have you sought professional help for these feelings?", "how? it's just skin. it's not sexual by any means. this is also a 12 year old were talking about, incase you forgot.", "A tummy is not sexual.", "There\u2019s some crazy going on in that household.

I guess I could have missed some subtext but OP only called out his mom. That said, the story makes a lot more sense to me if I imagine he was repeatedly staring at her, and his mom caught it, blames her instead of him,  and it's where this is all coming from.  That's classic.", "I like that I\u2019m not the only one thinking that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.

Unnecessary risk to take though.", "When you have to behave conservatively, your mind is one of the few places where you can let your sexy side out. Doesn\u2019t pan out well for some religious folk, and they project like this.", "Depending on the culture and location, first cousins actually *might* count as incest (legally and/or morally).\n\nPersonally, I think even thinking about having a romantic relationship (not to mention sex and.or marriage) with a relation that close is gross.", "I believe the reason it's illegal is because they're both minors and one is under the age of consent.\n\nThough you'd be amazed at how many people under the age of consent still get married in the USA every year - lots of states have loopholes where marriage is legal with a parent's permission even if the child is not legally able to consent to sex outside of marriage.", "It's true that incest is a universal taboo. However, other than parent/child and grandparent/grandchild, what \"counts\" as incest varies *considerably*.\n\nMost of the world does not consider first cousins to be incest. Or if they do, they might only consider mother's sister/father's brother to be incest - or they might only consider mother's brother/father's sister to be incest, but not *both* those things. Other cultures consider cousin marriages to be the *preferred* form of marriage.\n\nIn some cultures, if two infants happen to share a wet nurse, that makes them a form of sibling and then *that's* incest later on, even if there's no blood relation and they weren't actually raised as siblings. (I wouldn't go as far as that, but would say that two children who were raised together from early childhood as siblings would be incest, even if one or both of them was adopted and there was no blood relation.)\n\nIn some cultures, marrying your deceased spouse's sibling is a form of incest. (In others, it's preferred, or even mandatory if you don't have another option.)\n\nIn some cultures, marrying somebody who has the same last name - or a rough equivalent - is a form of incest, even if there's no way the two of you have any sort of blood relation.\n\nThe \"taboo\" against cousin marriage in the West (which is not universal even in the West!) can be traced back to the early Church, which found that banning cousin marriage broke up the tight kinship bonds promoted by cousin marriage, and gave more influence to the Church.", "Well, that's what genetic testing is for. I'm sure that if OP is Ashkenazi, they and all their family got tested for Tay-Sachs and anything else they might be prone to before they had kids, possibly before they married.\n\nIf you think it's likely that you're a carrier of something, you should get tested. Genetics doesn't care if you're actually related to the person you're having kids with. It only matters if you carry the same maladaptive recessive genes.", "Orthodox jew here, you did a great job explaining this!", "To your first point, it again depends on the state. Age of consent also varies by age, and less than a handful have that age set at 15. So that aspect of it more than likely would not be a factor.", "Hebrew school *is* good for something!"]}
