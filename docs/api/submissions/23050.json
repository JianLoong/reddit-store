My sister, (39F) her husband, (40M) and her kids (10M) (15M) also flew back at the same time we did as they live in Sweden and we don\u2019t get to see them very often. Now for context, my daughter loves clothes. Me and her dad may spoil her a little too much with them but she also buys majority herself and spends her money wisely. 4 days ago my daughter was wearing a cropped tank top and some shorts. This top wasn\u2019t very short at all and the shorts were at a good length not being particularly short. A little later that day she overheard my sister and her husband talking as she was waiting for the bathroom out in the hallway. She heard my sister call her a slut and an attention whore in her outfit and thought that she was trying to impress her 15 y/o son. Once she was out of the bathroom she started crying and told me all the things my sister said about her. I was furious, why would a full grown adult say that about a 12 y/o girl!! I brought up what she had said at dinner that night and she confessed to absolutely all of it and called my daughter a slut again right to her face. We left the dinner table and she started crying again. That night I got us a flight back home because I did not want to be around my sister anymore. The next day I told my mom and my sister that we were leaving and my sister blew up at me calling me an immature asshole because of some silly \u201cfeedback\u201d she gave on my daughter. I told her that she was the immature one commenting on a 12 y/o girl\u2019s appearance. We left and my sister has told everyone on my moms side of the family. I\u2019m getting a few messages from relatives saying that what she did was wrong but it was childish of me to walk out like that on a trip that was supposed to be fun. But most of them including my mom are in full support of my decision which I\u2019m very happy about. I\u2019m thinking of going no contact with her, AITA?\n\nEdit: I would like to add that my family is Jewish and my sister and her family are Orthodox Jews. Though they dress modestly because of religion, I don\u2019t feel this is a good reason as to call her names if we are not orthodox.", "created_utc": 1690237158, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158p1uv/aita_for_flying_back_home_after_my_sister_called/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Leaving was the least immature thing you could've done. Why would you want to stay around for a family gathering when your own sister berated your daughter? The family that is siding or agreeing with your sister is just enabling her behavior making her think she was in the right for slut shaming a 12 year old girl & if that's the case, it makes me question them as well. A crop top & shorts for a teenage girl is a completely normal outfit for a girl her age. You handled the situation appropriately & removed you & your daughter from your sister's toxic behavior.

I am Jewish btw", "NTA.  I don\u2019t think you should have left though.  Your sister is orthodox and believes fully in modest clothing. You could have explained to the daughter, in front of sis, that auntie and her family have very different beliefs about what a woman should wear and that she can ignore whatever auntie says to her.

Your sister was wildly inappropriate, regardless of her own beliefs in tzniut (modesty). No 12 year old girl should ever be called a \"slut\" especially from someone from her own family.

Religion is no excuse to comment on another persons choice of clothing especially if that person is not of the same religious beliefs as you. I am a Christian so I believe in dressing modestly because that is what the Bible.

Judaism has a strong and strict tradition of not only not imposing your religious practices on other people because consent without pressure is very, very important, but it has different views on modesty than other religions. Modesty in Judaism is called \"tznuit\", and it isn't supposed to be about just about the dress, the dress is just an outward signifier that you've adopted the practice, and it's mostly meant to be a practice for married adults within the confines of a marriage. Modest dress is supposed to signify a commitment to humility, gentleness, and restraint, and can go along with anything from not wanting to touch members of the opposite gender to the full Mike Pence of not wanting to be alone with them without your spouse present, though that's pretty extreme even in Orthodox Judaism. Most Orthodox Jews who practice tznuit will just, like, not want to shake hands with someone who isn't their gender and they aren't related to. \n\nWhat the OP's sister did is a far greater violation of the rules of tznuit than anything OP's daughter could possibly have worn - she was cruel, unrestrained in her judgment, and did this to a child. Judaism also takes the consent of children extremely seriously, which is the whole idea behind bar/bat mitzvahs, they're the point at which  children are considered old enough to begin to consent to all aspects of Judaism and make their own choices about how they choose to practice their faith. The rules of tznuit are explicitly clear that all this no touching and modest clothing stuff does not apply to children because you know, sometimes kids get messy! Imagine trying to dress a baby modestly or not letting your kid hug their friends because they happen to not be the same gender! That's extremely stupid! The tl;dr is that the OP's sister can be like blah blah my religion all she wants, but she's full of shit. The OP's daughter is 12. No rabbi in the universe would agree with her actions here.", "I'm sorry you have a horrible sister!"]}
