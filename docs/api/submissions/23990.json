My stepmother works part-time at the company, and the rest of the time theoretically is meant for taking care of the house and the family.\n\nIn this one year living with them, my stepmother doesn't properly take care of the house; I've taken care of a good portion of the household chores. However, the worst part for me is that she doesn't pay attention to my little brother.\n\nShe doesn't grasp that he's a child, so he needs attention and patience.\n\nShe has zero patience with the kid. Anything, and she's already threatening to put him in timeout instead of talking. Frankly, I find her approach quite aggressive. Let me give you an example: If he's playing video games and the TV volume is loud, she doesn't ask him to lower it; she just turns off the video game and says if he turns the TV volume up again, he won't be able to play for a week.\n\nShe also doesn't help him when he asks for it. If he's struggling with homework, for instance, I'm always the one who helps.\n\nEven with his food, she doesn't seem to care. She's vegan, and he, like any kid, can be picky with food. Several times I've had to prepare a separate dinner for him because he wouldn't eat what she made.\n\nFor me, the worst of it all was when she didn't show up for one of his school events. It was just me; my dad was traveling.\n\nAnyway, I'll be heading off to college very soon, and I'm really concerned about her handling him on her own. That's why I talked to my mom about it, and she talked to my dad.\n\nMy dad got furious and accused me of manipulating people against my stepmother to sabotage their marriage. He said she's still learning to be a mom. He promised that he will be much more present in home and he'll make sure that my brother is happy. He made it clear he doesn't want to discuss this issue of her taking care of my brother anymore.\n\nStill worried, I called my grandparents today to ask if they could keep an eye on my brother when I'm away.\n\nMy grandparents called my dad, and he got even angrier. He says I'm acting like a child by talking to everyone about my stepmother, that it's disloyal and immature, and that I'm fixated on her relationship with my brother. He told that he is the father and he knows how what is better to my brother.\n\nSo, AITA to don't want my little brother alone with our stepmom and talk about it?\n\nEdit:\n\nI forgot to mention a couple of things:\n\n1. I had mentioned a few times to my dad that I didn't like my stepmother's behavior, and he had said that I was overreacting, that she was doing her best.\n2. He called my brother and asked him in front of me and my stepmother if he liked her, if she treated him well, and so on. He was startled, could hardly look at my dad, and answered what my dad wanted to hear. So my dad took this as proof that I was manipulating my brother against my stepmother, that they actually got along well.\n3. About disloyalty: He thought he had made some sort of \"deal\" with me and my mom when he said he would travel less and stay home more, and he saw my talking to my grandparents as a breach of that \"deal,\" but I hadn't agreed to any such arrangement.", "created_utc": 1691289472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15je464/aita_for_not_wanting_my_stepmother_24f_to_take/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
