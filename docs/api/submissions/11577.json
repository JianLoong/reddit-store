She\u2019s in college and lives on campus. I agreed to help her make car payments, since she was in school. \n\nI was recently informed by a young man I work with that my daughter strips at a club about 40 minutes away. I confronted her on this and she said she  didn\u2019t plan to do it after she graduated, and she needed some money. I told her then work at McDonalds, not use her body.\n\nWe got into an argument, and i asked her to quit stripping and get a decent job then. She refused and said stripping was easy money, so basically I said there was no need for me to pay her car payment anymore since she is making money so easily. She got upset and said that wasn\u2019t fair, and that she doesn\u2019t make enough for that. I told her to figure it out.\n\nShe told my wife about what happened, and my wife is upset by her job of choice but says it\u2019s unfair for me to stop supporting her so suddenly over an argument. I think it\u2019s perfectly fair, it\u2019s my money and my decision when to cut it off.", "created_utc": 1678067040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jkp2q/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_daughter_with_her/", "score": 15053, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While I don't necessarily promote stripping as a profession I can certainly see how a struggling poor college student who has to keep their grades up would resort to that to make ends meet.

Some of them engage in prostitution, sale of drugs, or stringing along desperate fellows. Some of the women are attacked, sexually assaulted, seriously injured, or even killed. Strip clubs in general attract skeevy men who engage in all kinds of bad behaviors I would not want any of my kids around.\n\nFor a lot of the same reasons I would not want my kids working in a night club or bar.  They tend to attract drugs, exploitation, and crime.
