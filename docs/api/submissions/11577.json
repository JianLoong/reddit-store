She\u2019s in college and lives on campus. I agreed to help her make car payments, since she was in school. \n\nI was recently informed by a young man I work with that my daughter strips at a club about 40 minutes away. I confronted her on this and she said she  didn\u2019t plan to do it after she graduated, and she needed some money. I told her then work at McDonalds, not use her body.\n\nWe got into an argument, and i asked her to quit stripping and get a decent job then. She refused and said stripping was easy money, so basically I said there was no need for me to pay her car payment anymore since she is making money so easily. She got upset and said that wasn\u2019t fair, and that she doesn\u2019t make enough for that. I told her to figure it out.\n\nShe told my wife about what happened, and my wife is upset by her job of choice but says it\u2019s unfair for me to stop supporting her so suddenly over an argument. I think it\u2019s perfectly fair, it\u2019s my money and my decision when to cut it off.", "created_utc": 1678067040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jkp2q/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_daughter_with_her/", "score": 302, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While I don't necessarily promote stripping as a profession I can certainly see how a struggling poor college student who has to keep their grades up would resort to that to make ends meet.

Wow . Reddit moment", "He\u2019s not petty he just understands that she\u2019s making enough money to do it herself now", "No, she wouldn't. She'd just have you barred from the establishment \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nIt would also (potentially irreparably) damage your relationship, as she would either see you as a creep or trying to interfere with her job, perhaps both.", "Where?", "I agree. If I was in the dad's shoes, I found out that the only option my kid has is to strip, and then I would go nuclear on my finances. rather than let it happen. \n\nBreak retirement,  sell home, and take a second job. This can not be the only option.", "Just using the example OP gave, pretty sure there are more rewarding employment opportunities that would allow her to maintain OPs financial contributions, just takes a bit of research.", "For real though.", "Do you even know what an incel is? So dads that don\u2019t agree with their daughters working in the sex industry are all incels?", "must be a third world country...", "Going to guess that OP has a habit of making poor decisions.", "And? What does the co-worker have to gain by telling him?  How is the co-worker in any way superior to the daughter?", "This is my same thought.

Are her parents then covering tuition and rent? Plz stop incel.", "That\u2019s why I put esh. Did you not read the second part of my comment ?", "Do you give her an allowance so she can go hang out with friends? Buy her favorite dinner when she does awesome on an exam? Can she go out an buy herself a nice pair of boots? Can she do anything, does she have money to have a social life?! If you aren't giving her \"fun money\" she has to find it somewhere else. A scholarship is only for school stuff, she can't just buy a movie ticket with it.\n\nOh and as a former 8 year slave of the clown, you're an AH for telling her to work there. I can fucking guarantee you that many of my coworkers and I would have jump ship and got into stripping if we had the bodies for it.

Petty and unsupportive? She is STRIPPING.", "The entitlement here is rich.", "Simple way to get rid of the payment. Sell the car and pay full I\u2019m cash.  Parents don\u2019t have to pay for car payments. You f\u2019ing kidding me?", "If I was paying all the bills for my kid and they went out to embarrass me like that, I'd do the same thing.

Grow up.", "Honestly, don\u2019t have anything against it personally; as someone mentioned it\u2019s legal work. Looking at it from OPs perspective his reasoning is understandable to an extent. He most likely raised his daughter to a higher moral standard, and expects her to uphold this. \n\nSeeing as OP provided financial support for a car, there was probably some support provided for college. At least in my opinion, stripping should be a last resort. \n\nWhy not replace the car for something cheaper and work out an arrangement with OP to use the provided funds for necessities while maintaining a part time job? \n\nJust seems like some information is missing or OP didn\u2019t bother to dive further into her situation. \n\nEdit: Mb if my first comment came off wrong.", "He\u2019s allowed to stop giving a gift if she\u2019s behaving poorly.

Idk", "I never assumed. I said if. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t said if he does. I asked. He has not answered.", "He doesn't seem to have a problem with his coworkers going to strip clubs .", "Your argument is changing. Pick a lane and stick in it.
