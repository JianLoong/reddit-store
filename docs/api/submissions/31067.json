My SO (37m) has a 9 year old daughter and a 14 year old son, whom reside with us 50% of the time. Both his children have their own rooms and beds. We have been together for 3.5 years, living together for 3 of them. I love his children dearly. I treat them just as my own. I am very close to them and there have never been issues in that aspect. One thing that repeatedly resurfaces is that his daughter climbs into bed with us. When she was younger, she slept more soundly and didn't thrash about. We are both large people (I'm 6 ft and he is 6'6) and there just isn't room for another person in our bed. I have often been awoken by getting an elbow to the face that results in a bloody nose or hard kicks to my back and side. I have had several conversations and have brought up my concerns to my SO and it goes in one ear and out the other. He could sleep through a tsunami. I have asked that maybe he sleeps in between us, as to create a barrier between me and the flailing arms but she insists on being in the middle. I have slept many nights on the couch, and my back is sore and i don't achieve any level of quality sleep. I work a 8 to 5 job and run on three to four hours of broken sleep on the nights she is in our bed. I have tried to offer her comfort, singing her songs and tucking her back into bed, while he lay there snoring away, blissfully in slumber. I have grown resentful and increasingly frustrated. Today I told him that if we cannot work together to figure out a solution, that I will need to move into a place of my own. I do want to add that I hold great appreciation for affection and closeness with our children. I know how quickly they grow up and that in a short time they'll be teenagers and want nothing to do with us. I also feel like she could use some counseling, as well as a family could use some. I feel like it's not my place to repeatedly be the only one to correct her. He is an avoident type when it comes to issues and I'm a problem solver (I mediate for a living). I feel like my health and wellbeing don't matter and that we are failing to teach her independence and proper coping mechanisms. AITA if I refuse to allow her to sleep with us moving forward?", "created_utc": 1700087596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17w5ynn/aita_for_refusing_to_co_sleep_with_my_sos_9_year/", "score": 64, "replies": ["NTA. \n\n>Today I told him that if we cannot work together to figure out a solution, that I will need to move into a place of my own.

I feel like it's not my place to repeatedly be the only one to correct her. \n\nI think this is all right on the money. You live there and deserve to get quality sleep. It may be a (long) phase that she grows out and and I'm not saying the answer is to just kick her out. Her development and needs are important too. But I would die on the hill of you needing a solution that works for everyone and him actually parenting his daughter.", "NTA a child that she shouldn\u2019t be climbing into bed with parents and it something you both need to start addressing. I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to move out if you partner won\u2019t accept that", "I started to read, and at first I thought, \u201cJust go sleep on the couch, that will teach him.\u201d But you already do, and he still hadn\u2019t said anything? No ma\u2019am. Sorry, but 9 is too old to be sleeping in your parents\u2019 bed. And I get the feeling he knows it\u2019s a problem, but is too avoidant to do the right thing. I don\u2019t like the term avoidant, because it makes it sound like they want peace for everyone, but that\u2019s not the case; avoidant people really just force others to do their dirty work. It\u2019s manipulative. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  \n\nNot to be all hard ass and all but 9 is 9.\n\nAlso, enforcing boundaries is a good lesson to teach a kid. Its good for a kid to learn to respect boundaries.\n\nAlso, you are a step parent. What would mom think?  Would she feel threatened, like you are trying to replace her or something?\n\nPlease forgive me if this is not making sense. It is in my head, but I just had oral surgery and this is filtered thru an oxycodone lens. But def NTA.\n\nAlso, maybe SO can understand you have prior experience as a parent. I'm sure your experience really comes in handy. SO needs to understand he's gotta listen to you.  It may end up being a bigger issue than you losing sleep. Maybe a communication issue?", "My parents divorced when I was pretty young, maybe about six or seven. My sister and I had trauma from abandonment and we often slept in the same bed with our father. Eventually, when I reconnected with my mother as a teenager, she brought it up in court and it was used against my father in the custody battle.\n\nMy point is that regardless of the reason it was allowed, for the sake of not losing the child, put your foot down now. Best of luck to you.", "I don\u2019t suppose there is any other space you could claim as your bedroom? Not the couch. An actual bed and room with a door. Since he doesn\u2019t seem interested in addressing the issue, this might get his attention and get you some sleep? \u201cI\u2019ve decided to install a daybed in the home office.\u201d There is no way I\u2019d have the patience to deal with what you\u2019re describing.", "I have a 5 year old son. I often have to remind myself that some of the frustrating phases he goes through are just that. Phases. I try to remind myself that he\u2019s only going to be this little once and I try to accommodate him in a lot of ways. \n\nBut co-sleeping? Nope. Not happening. We did it once a couple of years ago while visiting family. He was scared in the middle of the night and wouldn\u2019t stop crying. We didn\u2019t want him to disturb everyone else, so in desperation we brought him  into our bed. Little dude flailed endlessly. I had elbows in my back and knees in my face the rest of the night and my wife and I were both exhausted.\n\nYou are NTA. Based on the information from your post, it seems to me like therapy could be helpful. I hope you will be able to find a way to navigate through this and come out happy, healthy, and of course, well rested on the other side.", "NTA and you gotta start waking him up whenever it happens and making him take her back to bed. Then he can sleep on the couch.", "NTA\n\n9 is plenty old enough to sleep on their own.\n\nTime passes very fast. If you both don't put a stop to this... Next year it's a 10yo \n\nThen after you blink a few times and some time passes they are 13 or 14yo? \n\nBe the bad person. You'll sleep and feel better", "Nine is too damn old to be climbing in yo parents bed and if it's causing you bodily harm and the girl is a wild sleeper she need to most definitely sleep in her own bed if she scared give her a nightlight NTA", "INFO: Why have you let her crawl into your bed from age 5-9? Why don't you just lock your bedroom door?", "And separate rooms? Maybe that's the solution while she decides to sleep on her own\n\nEdit for judgment NAH", "Butting in again, you and SO sleeping apart or kid sleeping in bed?\n\nThe wait and see approach is risky and could breed resentment for you two.\n\nYou've said what you needed.  You've been clear. \nBig guy needs to understand how serious this is starting to look.\n\nYou know how to be a good mom. You raised your kids. You also defined your problem to him. Also, good job there. He needs to hear you, and not use you to do his parenting. \n\nHe needs to understand that you have needs as an adult, the least of which is taking on a burden you should not have to. Good families work together. He wants a family, he needs to sleep less and listen more.\n\nI obviously hope for a good outcome for you guys, but I'm just a dude on Reddit.  Good luck.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds quite disruptive but maybe you could try to work out a solution where all 3 are happy", "NTA. I can barely sleep through the night with my partner and his cat so I can only imagine. We plan to move in together and we are going to get a king bed. He should really work with you. Not having good sleep really fucks with you.", "Nta", "NTA", "This sounds like a jealousy issue with the daughter , did the dad up root and leave the family or was it amicable?  My ex abandoned us and since then my son won\u2019t leave my bed it\u2019s draining , defiantly sounds like an emotional aspect of some sort", "NTA. How big is her bed? Can he share it with her so you can get some sleep in your bed? Maybe then dad will understand the problem.", "NTA. Cosleeping only works when both the adults and child are happy with the arrangement", "Lock the door?", "You need couple's counseling with him to explore why he's dumping all the parenting work on you.

I did this for a couple of my children that had problems sleeping in their own rooms (and yes, even at age nine) and it helped them (and me because I could NOT sleep when they were in bed with me wiggly little creatures that they are!). But, NTA for wanting to be able to sleep through the night and wanting your partner to do something to help with the situation. Sleeping with kids is like sleeping with a hydra!", "Ehh I co-slept till I was about 10 and I finally got my own room but i knew if I had a really bad day or night I could still crawl in with my mom and be protected \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f don\u2019t see the big deal here, I know a lot of people who have co-slept for \u201clonger\u201d than \u201cnecessary or normal\u201d", "Dang that\u2019s some old kids for a 39 yo", "YTA of course you are. Have a heart and don\u2019t be such a shrew about a little girl.", "Dude, PHRASING!!!!", "Dudes 37 years old and is a \"avoidant type\".  A load of crap. Let me put it bluntly, he clearly doesn't care. He needs to grow a set of fatherly balls and shut down that behavior real quick if he wants to have a relationship with OP.  Absolutly NTA", "The worst is that he will outright tell her that I'm the one who doesn't want her to sleep in our bed. I see now that maybe my problems are bigger than just the dispute over co sleeping.", "Her mom and I get along great. I don't think she would have an issue with it. I understand that on occasion she ends up in her mom's bed too. I just feel super torn. My own kids were incredibly independent and I never experienced this issue with them, so this is new territory for me. I feel like somehow I am the asshole because it may likely create a wedge between them or between her and I.", "9 is old enough to not sleep in parents bed. far too old for sure", "Wth?? Did your father lose the custody?", "That's my next move. I realize now that me having my own bed to sleep in peace is better than bickering with him about the matter. I just feel like if I force the issue that she'll end up resenting me and I don't want that. What's lovely about our dynamic is that I love his kids and they love me. Maybe once he sees how sleeping apart effects other areas of our relationship, he will step up and lay down the law.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "It was long established prior to me entering their lives. And as a step parent I didn't feel right in being the one to implement boundaries. He thinks it's acceptable. Probably more so that it's easier to just remain comfortable in bed and not wake up and put her back in her own.", "I came here to gain wisdom and insight. Perhaps I may find some.", "Omg get that cat out of the bed. Is it a girl? They are jealous and the more lraise they get for it, the more the cat acts out. I put a stop to some cat shananigans.\n\nI love my dog and my cat. But I love no fur in the bedroom, it's already everywhere else in the house", "They've been divorced for 5 years. Adjusting seemingly well. Her mom is remarried and everything seems amicable. We sit together at their son's football games ect. I do have a son that falls on the autism spectrum and suffers from adhd and anxiety and she appears to have similar behaviors and traits. I remember when my four were younger and I was young myself. I was 22 when my fourth child was born. All four of them 5 and younger. Every day seemed like just making it through. I was working and then to University and the kids had sports and friends and activities and it was hard to keep the house at bay. But each night I'd ask for strength and courage to make it through. I look at my SO and his ex as being in the same spot I was a decade ago and I hold understanding towards them both. Kids are hard. Especially after divorce and acclimating to a whole new life. I think that my SO is incapable of seeing the bigger picture in this situation. I'm a firm believer that as parents it is our job to teach and guild. These are the formative years. I wish so badly that she would pride herself in being independent. But she is only 9 and still needs to mature. I hate being an authoritarian. The mere thought of her growing to resent me is deeply troubling. My SO is just trying to make it through the days of work (he is an industrial electrician, so very physical) and then picking up kids, feeding kids, getting them to sports ect in the evenings. He is so tired by day end that 5 minutes after his head hits the pillow, he is out cold. I have stepped up, and am his partner in every possible way, but the co sleeping is literally killing my soul. I'm just so tired. The only thing I can think to do is set up an actual bed in the living room for me to escape to on the nights she is with us. I do however think it'll stunt her growth mentally and emotionally. She will struggle to adapt to the real world. Just so frustrating. I'm stuck trying to adapt to the lesser of two evils.", "Her bed is only a single. He'd probably crush it. He is a big guy.", "The issue is that it\u2019s interfering with OPs sleep.", "Could you survive off 3 to four hours of broken sleep? I think anyone would feel frustrated if that was their daily life.", "So i should take blows to the face and go without sleep? Am I understanding you correctly?", "Look I love when my kids crawl into bed with me and they are 11 and 12. But cosleeping shouldn\u2019t continue if anyone is unhappy about the arrangement. Part of being a parent is setting an example on how to set boundaries and prioritize our health.", "Wow, that's quite a jackass move on his part... \n\nINFO: Why do you let him lie there, blissfully snoring away, while you are awake and being kicked? Why do you not wake him up the minute she wakes you up \u2013 and make sure he doesn't get to fall back to sleep as long as you are awake?\n\nI don't suggest this because I think it's reasonable, but simply because, if you want to continue to live with this man and he isn't likely to change his character: Have you tried moving to her room when you wake up to find her in your bed? If it's more comfortable than the couch, it might be worth a shot. The only other thought I have is for you to swap rooms with her until he gets his act together, so he can spend all night, every night with his daughter and you can sleep in peace in her room. I'm sure they doesn't sound like a very attractive option to you, but my hope would be that it wouldn't be particularly attractive to him, either.", "My ex did this same thing, would wanna have his 10 year old son in our bed and nothing I could say would change his mind. Guess who is by himself now? My ex.", ">The worst is that he will outright tell her that I'm the one who doesn't want her to sleep in our bed. I see now that maybe my problems are bigger than just the dispute over co sleeping.\n\nBut it's true. . .and it's 100% ok.\n\nAnd it's ok for you to comm7nicate to her that you don't find it acceptable or appropriate that she sleeps in your bed.  She needs to be told that.\n\nIs your SO a manipulative fuck? Yes.\n\nIs he fostering dysfunctional behavior by refusing to deal with his daughter's issues? Yes.\n\nBut it's fine for you to start explaining to her that her behavior is not ok.\n\nAlso, start kicking your SO's ass out of bed- literally- every time his daughter comes into bed, and make him take her back into her room and go to bed.", "Yes, this signals a much larger problem.", "Yup.  My point above.", "You\u2019ll be able to work through it. I hope you get some sleep soon.", "So, the truth?\n\nHe wants her there, you don't. I would not prioritize you over my bond with my child either. Get a divorce. You guys aren't for each other.\n\n\nNAH", "The wedge is the 9 yo. You said so. \ud83d\ude09\n\nSeriously, where does it say that you have to have to deal with the issue on your own?\n\nYou are trying to help a child grow into a good adult who has adjusted well to insecurities.  The least your SO could do is call a family meeting and lovingly lay out what needs to happen. This is not all on you. You are far more gracious than I can be.\n\nI'll also reiterate, this could be a communication issue between you and your partner.  You are expressing your needs, he's rolling over and snoring.  Not cool. \n\nAlso, what happens with the kid when you guys decide to do the things adults do and the child comes in?  That could be an even longer conversation.\n\nPlease don't tell him I said all of that. I'm only 5'11\" and I bleed easily.", "Why can\u2019t you talk with your partner and just lock the bedroom door? Why is this such a fuss?\n\nIf he wants to open the door because she\u2019s having a meltdown after some time to sort herself out, he can go sleep in her room.", "I know this may not be the perfect solution, but what if on the nites that the kids are there, you kiss your SO good nite and go into the daughters room to sleep. If the mattress isn't comfortable, buy one that suits you. Put his daughter to bed in your room. Just a thought, or a start to show him how much it is affecting you.", "It came close, but no. As an adult, I totally see both sides. I know it was just us being kids and seeking comfort from our father, but I also understand why my mother saw it as inappropriate.", "But, aren\u2019t you ignoring the real issues by saying this?  You have a partner who will put the blame on you to his daughter, he doesn\u2019t care about you level of sleep and rest.  He\u2019s ignoring you and you wishes so you\u2019d go to another room with a bed.  That is simply more avoidance!  And for what?", "I hope so too.", "It's your bedroom. It wasn't a parenting decision it was enforcing that your and your partners bedroom was your private place. What happens if he wants to have sex and your daughter wants to come in? Is he okay locking the door then?\n\nTime to start locking the door.", "Then he needs to go sleep in her bed with her or she needs to sleep on a pallet on the floor.", "yea, I hope so, I haven't really got any ideas though \n\nwish you the best :)", "I\u2019m so sorry you sound like such a lovely , caring thoughtful lady , my worry is though that by you setting up a bed for yourself elsewhere is only going to make the daughter think she can get away with anything , I hope you find a decent solution soon x", "Well sometimes families might get a larger \"child's\" bed so that a parent may share it.", "You should think about child first and stop being so selfish.", "So to verify, if you were laying in bed with your significant other and your child, and on multiple occasions awoke with a bed full of blood from your child hitting and kicking around to them, you would think that is acceptable? The same SO who drives your kids to practices, makes your meals, washes yours and your children's clothes, and looks after all of you when you are sick, supports you in all that you do...you'd think it's okay to toss her aside? It's not about choosing one over the other. Unhealthy sleep is terrible for all involved.", "No.\n\nShe's the adult. She should sleep in **her** own bed.\n\nThe child is 9 years old and needs to learn to sleep in her own bed.\n\nKick your SO awake and have him deal with putting his daughter back to bed, or have him sleep in her room with her every.single.time.", "I love this answer. Get her a larger bed in her room. When she comes into the master bedroom, kick them both out. Everyone wins.", "Everyone should think about themselves first, it's not selfishness, it's a common sense", "If my wife came to me and said that that I had to either\n\nKick my daughter (who my divorce with her mother has clearly traumatized her) out of the last remaining bastion of security in my home \n\nOr\n\nShe would MOVE OUT\n\nI would toss her aside faster than an MLB pitcher, yes.\n\nYou only get so many chances and so much time to build up your children with unconditional love. Inversely, there are many other women to marry, who aren't apparently hemophiliacs.\n\nETA: This isn't to say that you are wrong. If I was in his position, I'd divorce you, and if I were in your position, I would divorce him. Neither of you is the asshole. You're just puzzle pieces that don't go in the same box.", "Explain to me what being 9 has to do with anything ? I'm 23 and if I genuinely needed my parents during a stressful time they'd let me crash in there bed. They would come home to me sleeping in their bed at 17 years old. She finds comfort in her father and that's not a bad thing. just because they have DIFFERENT boundaries doesn't mean they're UNHEALTHY boundaries.", "You must also remember that he is still a part time father. Maybe he is awaken by his daughter, but ignores it because he had so little time with her. So if you're kicking the 9yr old out of your bed on the free nights that she gets to spend time with daddy,  maybe your the selfish one...\n\nBeing s parent of 3, I can tell you that I have spent many nights on the cough or their bed to sleep. Yes there are times I bring them back to their room, but each time, as a parent, you have to evaluate the situation.  \n\nI also said to start there, not to make it the here and after solution.\n\nYes", "I would be totally down with her co sleeping if it weren't for the blows to the face and back. She is 9 but she I'd big for 9 as her Dad is really tall. My children slept with me too when they were growing up. I love affection and cuddles and I wish that she wasn't so aggressive when thrashing about. But unfortunately, this just isn't the case. I too have slept on a couch or a floor, so I understand what you are saying but once it starts to affect someone's sleep, it can become a problem. If the shoe was on the other foot and my child was wanting to sleep in bed but was hitting him and kicking him, I doubt he would tolerate it as patiently and gracefully as I have. I guess truthfully, unless someone has experienced something similar, I cannot hold expectation of being understood."]}
