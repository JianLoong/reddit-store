It becomes then a slippery slope.", "I'm going to flip out because they were out with their friends before out date? What she supposed to be all home all day until their date? Geez it's not the end of the world", "OP said they are on the cusp of being official. \n\nIf they were both thinking about getting serious, the girl was probably looking at OP as someone she could \u201ccome home\u201d to. My partner and I don\u2019t always do things together but there are plenty of times where we\u2019ve made plans to hang out after being out with friends. I\u2019ll cook or vice versa. I wouldn\u2019t be mad if they were late.", "One can go out with friends and still be on time for a planned date. It was rude of her to not text or call and then to show up half drunk, especially when you consider it's pretty normal to have a glass of wine or two on a dinner date. Was she just gonna continue getting drunk at his place?", "I can agree she should have sent a message but this is just my opinion if they were just going to hang out at his place and not go anywhere I wouldn't be upset over half hour. It's not like he was sitting at a restaurant waiting on her, unless we had somewhere to be a play, a concert, a sporting event, dinner reservations at a certain time its not a big deal also She had some drinks what's wrong with that??? Sounds like he is bothered she has alife aside from him", "Whenever someone uses the argument \u201cyou\u2019re home anyway\u201d I can\u2019t help but wonder. When you\u2019re at home, do you just sit and stare at a wall doing nothing? Waiting for something to happen? Being home doesn\u2019t automatically mean you have nothing better to do than just wait around.", "There is no indication that she drove. Could have had a cab drop her off. \n\nAnd that's fine that you do not enjoy drunk people, but I am assuming you would communicate that with someone you were potentially about to enter a serious relationship with. It's unclear whether OP shares your reservation, or made it clear", "More of a reason to not be bothered if he has things to do at home. I would think someone is crazy if they flip out because I was 30 minutes late to hang out at their house  \ud83e\udd23. Not like the Netflix movie started without her. Maybe the girl wanted to go out and not hang out at home.", "People whoe doesnt care if they waste my time and our plans goes straight to trash, NTA", "NTA Is it possible she has a drinking problem?", "NTA, it was disrespectful to show up to a preplanned date 30 minutes late and tipsy. You didn't have to put up with that, especially when she didn't bother to let you know she was running late", "Yeah if she wasn't absolutely sloppy drunk I'd say you've just successfully killed that relationship. Well done", "NTA. Who the hell shows up to a date half drunk and late on top of that? You were right that she should have gone back home....but did she drive drunk? - That's super irresponsible of her if she did, and I'd be noting that as a red flag moving forward - if you move forward.", "NTA. Thankfully you aren't a couple yet so it will be much easier to tell this person to kick rocks. Obviously you can still try to have a relationship with them if you want but I wouldn't want to date someone with no respect for me like that.", "ESH. I think your reaction was a bit extreme. 30 min is not that long of a time and she could have been nervous so she had a few cocktails with friends. Either way sounds like you guys weren't right for eachother bc she didn't respect your time and you got angry and sent her home lol", "Long time super-lurker, first time commenter. But this post left me *shooketh*.\n\nCan't give a judgement, because I have never in my life seen an AITA post that is more culturally alienating to me. I am Irish, and OP sounds like the definition of shit craic (an uptight, Moody Michael). Then again, if Irish people kicked out friends for showing up 30 minutes late and lightly fried, no one on the island would have company, at all. \n\nI'm 4 years sober by the way, so I'm not a fan of v drunk people... but like.... a little loosey goosey and 30 minutes late for calling on my *in to my house, where I am at my leisure* is something Id never, in my wildest dreams, consider 'wildly disrespectful'. \n\nAs Lorelai Gilmore would say, 'Calm down, German Train'.", "As someone who generally get annoyed as hell by lateness, I would have kind a been ok with it IF she had communicated she would be late and been apologetic when she showed up. But she did/was neither, which I understand why he was pissed.\n\nYTA", "Hi, I get what you're putting down.  OP's story is differently tho as they hadn't just started dating yet.  Also it's better, at least in my experience, to allow for delays when inviting someone over.  7p is come over and chill, maybe keep the cook company whilst drinking an adult beverage.  \n\nRelationship are difficult enough without resorting to exiling your partner off the island for being 30m tardy for a home-cooked meal because they got caught up with their friends.  You cannot control everything and OP seems to be skating on the edge of being that guy.  OP wants to pursue a serious relationship with this person and gets angry over a perceived slight, then proceeds to ruin the night? How dare she not contact me that she's going to be late when I know she's out with her friends!  \n\nOP wants to be bf/ gf but just showed his partner that he will not tolerate this behavior (30m late), and that's okay.  He could have maintained his cool, salvaged the night and maybe made a core memory.  He chose otherwise.  He might not be as ready or mature enough for a long term relationship as he thinks he is.  My opinion.", "Why are you trying so hard to excuse her behaviour? Being late if they agreed on an hour is rude, end of..."]}
