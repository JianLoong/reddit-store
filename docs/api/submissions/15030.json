I\u2019m beyond nervous to say anything to my sister because she is sensitive and doesn\u2019t respond to criticism well. I love her to pieces and have watched her life fall apart over the last two years because of the choices she\u2019s made. I won\u2019t get into the gritty details about how but I\u2019ll explain where she is in life now. She got a divorce from her husband about a year and a half ago and since then hasn\u2019t been part of her kids life. Both children (7m) and (14f) moved in with their biological fathers and she moved 1.5 hours away to live with her fianc\u00e9. Her kids have been really missing out on their mom and have both expressed disinterested in spending time with her new fianc\u00e9. Her fianc\u00e9 also has two children from his previous marriage. (4f) and (3f) who she really dislikes and \u201cfeels they\u2019ve ruined her life.\u201d She has no interest in being the mother of his children and has said she hopes they stop coming over because she doesn\u2019t want them around. Last night she told us she is marrying him in a month and I am speechless. She has a lot of money invested in his newly built house and I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s trying to secure her finances with the marriage. Out of all the mistakes she\u2019s made in the past two years this would be by far the biggest. Would I be an asshole to tell her she\u2019s making the biggest mistake of her life? That the children are more important then her and she\u2019s ruining the lives of 4 small children just to get what she wants?", "created_utc": 1681727678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pb593/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_about_to_make_a/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She sounds like a narcissist, who only cares about her wants and needs. If you do decide to talk to her, she\u2019ll probably go on with her current plans, and when it all turns to hell she\u2019ll probably blame you for not doing more to stop her.", "NAH - the conversation hasn't happened.\n\nBut to give a little more insight?  This conversation will not be easy to have.  \n\nShe has vested all of her hope on this marriage being the one size fits all solution and clearly hasn't thought about the lives of her children.  \n\nKids are expensive.  She has four of them, and lacks responsibility over her own finances.  \n\nMy suggestion? \n\nConsider how much time you have to throw a monkey wrench into the marriage works.  \n\nDevelop some financial solutions and see if you can help her develop alternative solutions to income.  \n\nIf what you say is true.  She will pull back from the courtship if it was purely financial.", "You would be NTA.\n\nBut i recommend stop seeing her behaviour as a mistake. It isn't, it's selfishness. She's making all these decisions on purpose.\n\n\nBut I would not say anything. Reach out to her ex, explain hin you want to be in the kids life and you DO NOT approve your sister's decisions.\n\nYou will not change her mind.", "NTA, but it doesn't sound as if your sister wants to have children in her life at all (both of hers are with their fathers, the children of her fiance she doesn't want). So trying to win her over as an argument why the children are more important than her might just not work.", "NTA. As a mother, I can\u2019t imagine how she can feel to negatively towards her own children. Honestly though, I doubt you saying anything will change her plans. I recommend focusing on your niece and nephew. Give your attention to them. None to their mother. If you don\u2019t live near by, send tons of mail from someone who truly loves them!", "I was all set to say you'd be the AH, but while she has already abandoned her own children, she's likely preparing to pressure her fianc\u00e9 to abandon his, too.\n\nMarrying into an existing family of 3 when you think 2 of them are ruining your life is a bad idea. Someone's going to get hurt. NTA. \n\nYou are probably going to end up damaging your relationship with your sister, but I suspect that if you stand back and quietly watch your sister alienate her husband from his children, while you continue to try to be there for her own alienated children, you may do real harm to your relationship with yourself.", "YWNBTA, but given what you've said about your sister I doubt any such conversation with your sister will have a positive effect. Perhaps more to the point would be a conversation with your sister's fianc\u00e9 about what his relationship with his two girls would be like moving forward, and what he expects your sister's relationship with them to be like. A conversation like that will either reveal he's a similarly shitty parent, or bring home that your sister and her fianc\u00e9 have wildly different expectations about their future family dynamic.\n\nIt is possible that the fianc\u00e9 doesn't see that your sister isn't involved in her own children's lives through her own actions and wishes - he might have been misled to think instead they are angry at her, or being kept from spending time with their mom by their biological fathers.\n\nOn the subject of biological fathers, is that a typo (which should read 'father') or do you mean that they have different dads? Because if her two kids they are living in separate households, they are probably missing each other too, not just their mom.", "NTA.\n\nPull out the popcorn because this is going to be a long pile up train wreck.", "I don\u2019t have any judgment for you but are you sure you want to waste your energy and efforts?\n\nI mean of all the things you can do in this situation, maybe try being there for your niblings to support their relationship with each other? Those kids must be missing each other and their respective fathers probably don\u2019t have a lot of long term incentive to facilitate one.\n\nYour sister is actively choosing train wrecks, she\u2019s not going to listen. Leave her be. Break whatever cycle of bad decision making she might be creating for the next generation by encouraging a safe and reliable family connection for her children.", "Your sister needs to look up the word accountability in the dictionary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To her own kids and to someone else's now too. To want to alienate their father from them. I'm almost half a mind to say I'd let him know of that intent before they get married and she potentially drags an innocent family into it.", "NTA But go carefully. It sounds like she already made her mind up. She's selfish and self-centered. To think she doesn't care about the lives of children hers and otherwise is just plain evil.", "NTA\n\nBut I kinda hope for the sake of all the children involved that she doesn't marry that man. Rejecting the 4 and 3 year old, AND not being around her own children? She doesn't want kids in her life, so why on earth marry a man with 2 more of them?!?! She's a A. \n\nLike others have said, you can talk with her, but given her actions I don't expect her to listen. She seems rather selfishly motivated.", "Wow NTA how can that person marry your sister? Doesn't he see how she thinks of his children? She abandoned her own children and now wants to destroy her fiance's children. Prevent it, someone has to do something, your sister is a bad person. She's clearly after the legacy of her fiance and she will manipulate him to get what she wants.", "Nta. I'm not going to offer much advice since what's been said has been good. Would only say that a letter, or some sort of written format, may be beneficial so you're able to lay out a coherent argument without being interrupted and sidetracked. \n\nGood luck", "ESH  Stay out of it.  Sister knows what she's doing and doesn't care about the same things you do.", "YWNBTA \n\nHowever, I think you're fooling yourself, thinking she wants custody of her children ever again.", "NTA\n\nTell her once, speak your piece, and never bring it up again.", "NTA. She has two children with two different fathers. Got divorced and abandoned the kids. She is the worse. I would cut her from my life but stay in touch with your niece and nephew", "Thank you for the advice. That\u2019s kinda what I\u2019m afraid of. I didn\u2019t mention that I\u2019d be willing to let her live with us as a way \u201cout.\u201d We have an apartment upstairs that she and the kids could live in. Maybe if she saw an out it would help\u2026", "That\u2019s very good advice! I\u2019ve got a bit of time. Maybe enough to put alternative ideas in her head. I want her to move in with me and get the kids back. I don\u2019t know if she would go for it though. She would be walking away from a large investment but honestly I think it would be better to throw the money away then deal with another messy relationship if it should end.", "Thank you for the advice! Her kids live very close to me! Her older daughter is really pulling away and I feel like I\u2019m annoying her. If her daughter, my niece is being distant with me should I continue to reach out? I love her kids and it\u2019s been hard to keep in contact with them through their dads. Their understandably bitter about the situation.", "If you don\u2019t like kids you\u2019d shouldn\u2019t have them but; too many people have kids for the wrong reason. They give in to pressure from partners who want kids. Or they think that a child will be a little doll that they can play with it disappointed by the reality of parenthood. Or worse they have the kids and attempt to grasp child support money.", "I feel like it\u2019s not my place but at the same time I really do love her and I don\u2019t want to see her make anymore mistakes. It\u2019s getting hard on the entire family and it\u2019s\nGetting hard for me to stand by and watch. \nPart of me wants to stand by and part of me wants to yell at her to get it together and be there for her existing children.", "Out of all the advice I\u2019ve been given today this is probably the best. Her two kids were pitted against eachother and sadly the older one hates the younger one. The younger one is a perfectly normal child but the older sister thinks he is the worst and I can\u2019t put my finger on why. I\u2019m worried about the older girl. She\u2019s expressed to me that she doesn\u2019t care about anyone but her self. She doesn\u2019t even care that she lost her horses this year (her father also went through a breakup and the step mom took the horses) I told her that\u2019s not really normal and she SHOULD feel sad about those things. Even when I get them together she\u2019s just plain mean to the little boy and it makes me livid.", "I know most fathers would feel that way but im pretty sure he\u2019s on the same page as her. She\u2019s even told me he said, \u201cif I keep hitting them im hoping they won\u2019t want to come over anymore.\u201d I didn\u2019t hear him\nSay this, this is just what she told me he said out of anger once. So im not sure if that would deter him at all.", "I think she wants them to love her and it hurts her when they reject her (refusing to go to her house) but I just don\u2019t see the effort on her part to be with her kids. It\u2019s hard to accept that maybe this is the way she wants it. In which case I would be the ass hole for calling her out. Part of me still believes it\u2019s circumstantial and she DOES want to be around her kids. It\u2019s just getting harder to believe as time goes on. I don\u2019t want her to have deep regrets as an old person and I know she will if she doesn\u2019t step up.. and soon.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of. That all this is intentional. It would make me sick to know that. Her kids are really great kids. She\u2019s never openly said that she doesn\u2019t want her kids but literally every action she takes is the opposite to her words.", "I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s a generation thing. My brother doesn\u2019t have his children either. It\u2019s embarrassing and makes me so angry. They are really lovely children. Super cute, super kind kids. My mother raised us alone and never abandoned us, yet they hate her for not being a \u201cgood parent.\u201d I really can\u2019t relate to where they are coming from.", "If she lived with you, she wouldn\u2019t have her lover/fianc\u00e9. I\u2019m sure that wouldn\u2019t work for her. \n\nAnd after all the stunts she has pulled, I think the best she could hope for is the kids can live upstairs when they *visit*. I can\u2019t see the, (you said \u201cunderstandably bitter?), fathers being happy letting her have the major custody?\n\nBut\u2026 you can offer, I guess.", "I guess I only know to suggest; never stop showing you care. Maybe ask questions about what they love, that is enriching their lives. And nurture that. That\u2019s what I wish my dad (God rest his soul) would have done when I was growing up.", "You're NTA for wanting to help your sister. But she's not going to get it together for her children. She's not going to accept that she's making yet another mistake. Something is seriously wrong with her and she needs professional help. Unless you can convince her of this, you will be spitting into the wind.", "That has me worried tremendously tbh. I'm unsure what the best course of action is here but if they give you further reason for physical abuse you should maybe call cps. These attitudes are how small children end up passing away.", "Her only regrets will revolve around her own security and comfort. I'm sorry you have to watch someone you love be so awful.", "You\u2019re probably right. It\u2019s been about a year since they\u2019ve lived full time with their dads. I could possibly see the older daughters father being okay with having a room here but the little guys dad probably wouldn\u2019t be okay with that.", "Ugh\u2026. I really hope it\u2019s not true but even she said \u201cI used to wonder how parents could accidentally kill their kid but seeing how angry he gets I understand how it can happen.\u201d Ive expressed to her how messed up that is and if it\u2019s true he will probably hit her son (7m) at some point in the future. It like she tells me these things to make him look bad but it makes her look bad too because she\u2019s not doing anything about it. Even if she\u2019s exaggerating I\u2019ve talked about contacting cps with my husband already because you\u2019re right. It\u2019s super troublesome and worrying. She thinks they girls are delayed because they have learning disabilities but I think they are delayed because their brains are always in fight or flight mode.", "You can prepare a room and offer it. That\u2019s all you can do."]}
