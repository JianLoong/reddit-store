Your reasons are perfectly reasonable as a homeowner and the person eventually responsible for dealing with the mess. You're not squelching your daughter's creativity.

You're not restricting her from painting at all or hanging her art on her walls. Again, reasonable. \n\nCarpet is expensive af to replace or tbh even to professionally clean, so of course you don't want paint on it.

Oil paints and their associated chemicals are highly toxic. Over time they eat through surfaces. Canvas and other materials artists paint on are treated to avoid this. Also it is HIGHLY important for her to wear gloves while painting with it. Contact over time on the skin leads to heavy metal poisoning and death. Even just wiping it on your clothes and letting it seep through to skin can cause this. I have heard too many stories about other painters who did not take this seriously and died slow agonizing painful deaths. You should be working in well ventilated areas and take breaks from the fumes occasionally. Mineral spirits to thin the paint are also known spontaneously combust when on rags and such. \nWhen I work all rags and other detritus from painting go into a metal trashcan with a sealed lid. When not in use they go into a sealed metal box. I hate that these materials are often treated so casually, but truly many people don\u2019t know this. I cringe when I see oil painters on social media not wearing gloves, getting terribly messy, and FINGER PAINTING.

If she gets a job, and it\u2019s really that important to her to paint her room like a canvas, she can save up money to have the carpet replaced in her room, if it gets messed up and will affect your deposit. If she doesn\u2019t mess up the carpet and uses drop cloths, the money that she saved is hers free and clear. \n\nAlso, if you make this deal with her, she needs to save the money before she can start painting and you have to be okay with drop cloths on her floor for the foreseeable future.

I wanted to paint the walls black (oh, edgy teenage punkrock ideas), which my mom vetoed.

It was part of my identity.\n\nIt's ultimately up to you, but is there any chance you could buy a sheet of drywall and \"hang\" it on one wall, lay down a tarp or cheap/used rug, and still let her?  It feels like a decent compromise because then you'll only have to patch the screw holes/mounting points and the rug can come up.

But out of those 100 times, my parents helped me 98 times. And they are still one of my best childhood memories. I was a messy artist too. My dad would make me a table or a cover or anything. My point is, that age is tricky and you should encourage her to do something creative. If she wants to paint in her room, get a dedicated corner.

This can be laid down over the carpet (a friend did this in her bird room so that there wasn't bird poop all over the carpet).  If need be, use clear strong tape to tape the linoleum to the baseboards.  That solves getting paint on the carpet.  Another solution could be to get cheap throw rugs/runners to put along the walls so that there's a layer between paint container and rental property carpet.\n\nFinally, plywood isn't that expensive, and it's not difficult to create a fake wall in front of the painted wall without any damage to the existing wall.  You could use small nails like you'd use to put up pictures, etc, to fasten strips of 1x1 or 1x2 lumber near the top and bottom of the wall, and then nail plywood sheets to those.
