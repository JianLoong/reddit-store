Your reasons are perfectly reasonable as a homeowner and the person eventually responsible for dealing with the mess. You're not squelching your daughter's creativity.

You're not restricting her from painting at all or hanging her art on her walls. Again, reasonable. \n\nCarpet is expensive af to replace or tbh even to professionally clean, so of course you don't want paint on it.

Oil paints and their associated chemicals are highly toxic. Over time they eat through surfaces. Canvas and other materials artists paint on are treated to avoid this. Also it is HIGHLY important for her to wear gloves while painting with it. Contact over time on the skin leads to heavy metal poisoning and death. Even just wiping it on your clothes and letting it seep through to skin can cause this. I have heard too many stories about other painters who did not take this seriously and died slow agonizing painful deaths. You should be working in well ventilated areas and take breaks from the fumes occasionally. Mineral spirits to thin the paint are also known spontaneously combust when on rags and such. \nWhen I work all rags and other detritus from painting go into a metal trashcan with a sealed lid. When not in use they go into a sealed metal box. I hate that these materials are often treated so casually, but truly many people don\u2019t know this. I cringe when I see oil painters on social media not wearing gloves, getting terribly messy, and FINGER PAINTING.

If she gets a job, and it\u2019s really that important to her to paint her room like a canvas, she can save up money to have the carpet replaced in her room, if it gets messed up and will affect your deposit. If she doesn\u2019t mess up the carpet and uses drop cloths, the money that she saved is hers free and clear. \n\nAlso, if you make this deal with her, she needs to save the money before she can start painting and you have to be okay with drop cloths on her floor for the foreseeable future.

I wanted to paint the walls black (oh, edgy teenage punkrock ideas), which my mom vetoed.

It was part of my identity.\n\nIt's ultimately up to you, but is there any chance you could buy a sheet of drywall and \"hang\" it on one wall, lay down a tarp or cheap/used rug, and still let her?  It feels like a decent compromise because then you'll only have to patch the screw holes/mounting points and the rug can come up.

But out of those 100 times, my parents helped me 98 times. And they are still one of my best childhood memories. I was a messy artist too. My dad would make me a table or a cover or anything. My point is, that age is tricky and you should encourage her to do something creative. If she wants to paint in her room, get a dedicated corner.

Another solution could be to get cheap throw rugs/runners to put along the walls so that there's a layer between paint container and rental property carpet.\n\nFinally, plywood isn't that expensive, and it's not difficult to create a fake wall in front of the painted wall without any damage to the existing wall.  You could use small nails like you'd use to put up pictures, etc, to fasten strips of 1x1 or 1x2 lumber near the top and bottom of the wall, and then nail plywood sheets to those.

In addition, the fumes of oil based house paint are crazy toxic and you have to ventilate. It would be something she would have to do in a day or 2 not something she could work on when she wanted. That is really the main reason in my opinion - the oils, the cost, the toxic fumes, it probably being something she wants to work on over time.

It's just like when you spill water on paper and it gets warped", "I don't see automod.", "Wtf my hobby is horses and I wasn't allowed to wear my barn boots in the house\n\nThe hobby is allowed where I appropriate", "Building the frame was the hardest part for me. Attaching the canvas was fun though!", "It would have been nice to have that information in the original post I agree. But we do have it now.", "She\u2019s only young once. F*ck the carpet, it can be replaced. In fact, rip the carpet out and let her paint floor to ceiling. Even if it looks like crap this will be something that makes her happy for the longest time and gets you cool mom points.", "Her room, let her do what she wants", "This! A few friends and I were hospitalized after an odorless solvent was chewed through by a squirrel in our garage studio. We had space heaters in the winter because it wasn't a heated and it leaked into the heater. Because it was also a garage we didn't really notice any smell because even odorless solvents can have a slight smell. We are lucky no one died, but some of us have permanent lung damage.", "While I\u2019ve missed the comments you\u2019re referring to, my disappointment in OP due to their complete lack of creative parenting/problem solving. \n\nI don\u2019t think they\u2019re an AH, just one of those \u201cI said no and that\u2019s that\u201d types. Hopefully they will heed some of the compromises other commenters have made. \n\nIt seems like this would be a golden opportunity to teach the kid we can\u2019t do everything we want b/c of legal & financial ramifications. In this case losing the rental deposit. But we can come up with a solution by creating a gallery in her room by displaying a mural or smaller canvases that can be rotated out. \n\nBonus points if OP also drives home the point that as renters and just a person sharing space we need to respect the property.  Have the teen select and be responsible for her studio by using and cleaning drop cloths and her space when she\u2019s done painting each day. \n\nIt seems worthwhile to engage in a solution that teaches rather than wielding the resentment-breeding \u201cbecause I said so,\u201d (and yes there are instances when that response is necessary).", "This won't work though. It's not just the carpet, it's the walls. Op 100% won't get his deposit back if she paints on the walls the way she wants to. Also, she's 15, and a lot of jobs won't hire until 16. So a job may not be an option for another year. Also, that's just kind of dumb, because if the landlord finds out and is upset, they won't give a good reference when OP needs it for another place.", "Decent dropcloth would be cheaper, and good for early projects of this scale", ">Easy way is to get a large mural canvas roll, let her paint it in the basement and hang on the wall of the room once it is dry.\n\nthat is an amazing idea! Plus, when she wants to change it to something out, she can easily take it down and put a new one shes pants on  the wall.", "Also, wouldn't oil paints likely seep through whatever paint they tried to put over it?", "The way people treat houses like objects that should be traded and not places people fucking live is disgusting.", "She should get some removable wallpaper for her room, paint on that, and peel it off when they move. The cheapest one they can find.", "Plus, they\u2019re renters. A lot of landlords are particular about the walls being painted. I know some don\u2019t allow them to paint bold colors that can be harder to paint over. It\u2019s not their walls to treat however they want.", "What about repainting the walls with chalkboard paint", "Nah, they can purchase larger canvas or plywood board or any number of other materials to paint.  This is where compromise comes in and the understanding that the parent gets to make the call here.", "I think asking the daughter to paint furniture that will be in her room is an awesome compromise.  She could find \u201ccool\u201d pieces like lounge chairs, headboard, footboard, a desk, and coffee tables. If they buy them from a store that sells used furniture they will find mostly pieces made of real wood and not particle board.  Painting real wood will make the pieces last a long time.  Then she can paint them again as she leaves home and takes some of that furniture with her.", "I literally agreed because they are renting. I said in other comments that they should compromise with exactly what you just said. \n\nWhat I'm countering is you saying \"there's no reason to paint her walls.\"\n\nThere is, because she wants to, it's a way to express herself, and if they owned the house it wouldn't be as big of an issue. OP said themselves that if she was less messy with her painting they would honestly consider it. So it sounds like OP would be fine with it if they owned the house and she was less messy.", "I've done large paintings on posterboard before. So many options for large, non-permanent art!", "Actually, a canvas drop cloth would be perfect for this and cheaper than buying canvas by the yard - a 6' x 9' drop cloth is only $15 at Lowes and the edges are already finished.", "Yknow, maybe I\u2019ll just stick to acrylics then.", "I get it.  If she wanted to do it once, no big deal.  Treating a wall as a canvas is simply more trouble than it is worth.", "It just depends on if they want it to be easy for storage or moving in the future. Unframed canvas can be more easily rolled up for example.", "I highly recommend trying gouache paint! It\u2019s a good in between of acrylic and oils and not toxic! Super easy to build up and slower to dry, so you can keep working on it!", "I'm not sure what your point is, because I already said that because of what you just said, it's a bad idea, because they rent so it's not their house to potentially ruin walls or harm them.\n\nBut OP has already said they would consider letting her do it if she was cleaner. So I don't think the issue is using the wall as a canvas, it's that they rent and she's very messy and gets paint on the floor. If they owned the house, it wouldn't be anywhere near as much of a problem for them to have to sand the walls down to repaint if they even wanted to sell the house at all.\n\nYou're agreeing to the same things I am. I'm just saying if they didn't rent it would be different. I don't know how to make that more clear.", "Omg. This is such a rude comment. Of course she fucking knows.", "Absolutely - I've torn down some of my own canvases so I could roll them up to move. I remember breaking out into bigger paintings around the daughter's age, and posterboard + acrylics was a cheap and convenient way to do bigger pieces for my room without spending a ton. I still have a couple rolled up in storage, and they're probably never gonna be flat again. I just hope the parents can find a compromise in all the suggestions here!", "Yeah, but you don\u2019t seem to be getting the fuller picture that this should never have gotten this far to begin with.  A parent\u2019s duty is to foster a child\u2019s interested, not placate them completely.  Canvas was offered. Wall was declined. Further negotiation and confrontation on the issue isn\u2019t necessary."]}
