I moved back to my my mom's house a month ago to regroup until I start a new job elsewhere next month.  \nI'm shattered. I've been struggling to function and have just been trying to go to the gym once a day before returning to isolate. I haven't even wanted to see my closest friends for more than a couple hours. My mom gets this and respects my space. My dad (75m) not so much.  \nMy parents are long divorced. My dad deals with trauma by needing constant attention and doesn't understand when other people don't want that. I'm used to my dad, but the issue is with his wife (60f). She has always been unpleasant to me but with a smile that come off as \"sweet\" (i.e. praising me when I was a child with bulimia for wearing things that \"hid fat,\" telling me I'm lucky to be smart instead of pretty like her daughter is, petty shit like that). Anytime anything bad happens to me she pounces with pseudosympathy and fake smiles and backhanded compliments. My dad is blind to her nastiness even though plenty of people have seen it.  \nI told my dad that I would be ok to see him for now, but I didn't want to see his wife until I come back at Christmas. This resulted in many lectures from my dad telling my his wife loves me, plus him dissolving into tears because he's currently estranged from his wife's daughter (33f) (for good reasons I won't go into here that involve her stealing) so he needs me to \"be a family\" with him and his wife. After almost a month of this, I acquiesced and agreed to a lunch, but told him I was unhappy to go, can barely function, and wouldn't be able to pretend to be happy to see her. He said ok.  \nI met them at a restaurant and immediately my father's wife said \"it's so weird to see you without \\[ex-husband\\]\" and then asked if I'd be offended if she ordered a mimosa given what I'm going through. I immediately went into giving one-word answers to anything she asked and  cut her off to ask my dad questions about pedantic things he'd talk about at length since it's easy to get him to talk unchecked for a long time. I wasn't hungry and ate two bites of my food. My father's wife kept on prodding me to send it back to the kitchen and made a huge scene to call a waiter over to tell him I didn't like the food and was already going through a \"hard time\" and should have my meal comped (Food was fine, I just am having trouble eating). At this point I apologized profusely to the waiter and then said goodbye to my dad and left.\n\n  \nMy father is very upset and says I should have at least smiled and appreciated that she was trying to \"take care of me.\" I told him I made it clear that I didn't want her or anyone to take care of me and that I warned him my coming to this was solely to appease him.

I know a lot of people will be giving you advice on how to handle them, but with what you are going through already, you don't need all that as well. Go low contact with them for the foreseeable future, maybe enlist your friends and family in helping with that while you deal with the more urgent matters (your marriage ending, husband drinking, life imploding).

Your dad's wife is a monster. You need to have a very frank discussion with your dad about her behavior. Don't back down and don't let him guilt you. Set your conditions. If he wants you to be a family, she needs to make an effort. Respect given is respect earned, and she has given you none. Your primary concern here is yourself.

You're going through a lot and want your family to be a support system. Because family. But it will do you good long term if you take this opportunity to see who besides your ex husband doesn't need to be a priority in your new healthier life. Your dad is enabling his wife. He's every bit as much a problem as she is. You don't deserve that. Time to take charge of what you want your life to look like.", "NTA.
