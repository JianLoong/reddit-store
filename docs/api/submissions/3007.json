{"id": 3007, "submission_id": "z2c0nm", "title": "AITA for uninviting my MIL from Thanksgiving because she refuses to eat my cooking?", "selftext": "This year I (32F) am hosting Thanksgiving at my house and I have been working all month on coming up with the menu and testing all my recipes. I am so excited to share my cooking with my family and my husband (35M) has been supportive and helpful through all the planning and prepwork. I have bought all the ingredients and I have a beautiful variety of dishes planned (both traditional and a few unique additions).\n\nWell today my husband dropped the bombshell on me that his MIL wants to bring her own dinner to eat when she comes over. I asked him why she would need to bring her own food when I will have more than enough here. He just made excuses saying I know how his mother is a \"grade A picky eater\" and she won't \"like\" anything I have prepared. I thought that was ridiculous, I am not making anything unfamiliar to her and there will be plenty to choose from. He argued that her bringing her own dinner would be a good compromise and I disagree. It will be hugely obvious that she's making a comment on my cooking and it would be humiliating to have her there eating something completely different in front of everyone, it's like she's trying to make a point of showing that my cooking isn't good enough for her.\n\nI think she is being incredibly rude and disrespectful of the time, money, and labor I have put into this upcoming meal. I told him if she can't eat anything here then she is welcome to stay home and eat whatever she wants. My husband is now calling me insensitive and petty. He says I am ruining the holiday. I don't see it that way. I only want friends and family around who are appreciative and kind - I don't need the negativity of someone rejecting everything I've cooked and insulting my cooking when I've worked so hard.\n\nThis has truly been a labor of love and I took on this responsibility to share that love with my family and friends. AITA for not wanting my MIL to come if she's going to reject everything I've made?\n\n**TLDR:** My MIL is refusing to eat anything I cook at Thanksgiving and wants to bring her own personal meal, AITA for uninviting her?\n\n**EDIT:** Because some people are asking, here is what I plan on serving:(First all the traditional thanksgiving foods) roasted turkey, stuffing, classic creamy mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin, sweet potato casserole, green bean casserole, cranberry sauce, roasted carrots, homemade bread rolls with apple butter, roasted squash with goat cheese, honey glazed ham, braised short ribs, spinach, bacon, & feta cheese pies, special lasagna with white sauce, stuffed mushrooms, creamed corn with cheese, and then pecan pie, pumpkin pie, and apple pie for desserts. It's a lot!\n\nHow can there not be one thing she can eat?", "created_utc": 1669168401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2c0nm/aita_for_uninviting_my_mil_from_thanksgiving/", "score": 1878, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's often suggested as a way to still go and enjoy without troubling the host to cater to 1 specific person. \n\nSo I'm really confused at all the comments against the MIL because OP perceives her actions as a slight. \nI think it's hard to say who TA is without more info backing up why OP thinks MIL is targeting her, and also why it matters so much...\n\n If she is trying to slight you, her eating the food and complaining about it will not make the holiday more enjoyable for you.

They aren't looking for attention, they don't like that they're picky eaters, and they didn't choose to be picky eaters.

I think it\u2019s worth having a conversation with your MIL about why she\u2019s bringing her own food. Does she have a dietary issue, allergy, special diet? For instance a friend of mine has celiac and can\u2019t risk cross contamination and will bring her own food. I\u2019m vegan, so in most instances I\u2019ll bring a couple of dishes to contribute to the meal that I know I can eat.\n\nEither way tho, if you let her bring her own food she\u2019ll have to explain to why and people will either understand if it\u2019s reasonable, or see that she\u2019s the AH.", "It sounds like you express your love for your people through food and event preparation which is awesome.

Trying new foods, being pressured into trying new foods, causes me to have severe anxiety. Your mother in law has her reasons. She\u2019s not asking you to cut off your left arm, she\u2019s asking to bring her own food so she can have dinner with her family without causing her anxiety and without causing you to do anything extra. Being patient, kind, and understand literally costs you nothing. You\u2019re the AH.

Your MIL may have any number of reasons to not want to eat the food you are making, and it may very well have absolutely zero to do with you, and even if it does, her proposed compromise is adequate. \n\nSome people have medical dietary needs, sensory issues, some people have food insensitivities, some people plain just have preferences that can\u2019t be shaken. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you asked for dietary input from anyone who is attending. If your MIL was the AH, she would be telling you to change your food. Instead she is simply wanting to bring her own meal, something she would be comfortable with. And frankly, something I have done several times when I had strict medically necessary dietary restrictions.

I found out that it was autistic last month (literally last month) at almost 40 and that explains a lot of this, but what happens for me is that for reasons absolutely unknown some days certain smells, textures, or even the look of a food triggers off a gag reflex in me. It can be a food I love and I just can not eat it without vomiting. \n\nThe other is that, these days, I have gut issues, and now I have to be super careful with what I eat but a lot of people don't get it.

People also don't realise that yeast is found in so many basic cooking ingredients like soy sauce and vinegars. Yeast is one of 5 dietary allergies, and on top of that I have specialised 'my body is fucked' dietary restrictions on top of that.

I am so excited to share my cooking with my family and my husband (35M) has been supportive and helpful through all the planning and prepwork. I have bought all the ingredients and I have a beautiful variety of dishes planned (both traditional and a few unique additions).\n\nWell today my husband dropped the bombshell on me that his MIL wants to bring her own dinner to eat when she comes over. I asked him why she would need to bring her own food when I will have more than enough here. He just made excuses saying I know how his mother is a \"grade A picky eater\" and she won't \"like\" anything I have prepared. I thought that was ridiculous, I am not making anything unfamiliar to her and there will be plenty to choose from. He argued that her bringing her own dinner would be a good compromise and I disagree. It will be hugely obvious that she's making a comment on my cooking and it would be humiliating to have her there eating something completely different in front of everyone, it's like she's trying to make a point of showing that my cooking isn't good enough for her.\n\nI think she is being incredibly rude and disrespectful of the time, money, and labor I have put into this upcoming meal. I told him if she can't eat anything here then she is welcome to stay home and eat whatever she wants. My husband is now calling me insensitive and petty. He says I am ruining the holiday. I don't see it that way. I only want friends and family around who are appreciative and kind - I don't need the negativity of someone rejecting everything I've cooked and insulting my cooking when I've worked so hard.\n\nThis has truly been a labor of love and I took on this responsibility to share that love with my family and friends. AITA for not wanting my MIL to come if she's going to reject everything I've made?\n\n**TLDR:** My MIL is refusing to eat anything I cook at Thanksgiving and wants to bring her own personal meal, AITA for uninviting her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My sister has AFRID and couldn\u2019t eat rice for years, as well as a a lot of meats because of the texture. I also have a distant relative that had food poisoning so bad from someone else\u2019s cooking that she nearly died, and now will only eat food she cooked herself, years later.\n\nIs there a compromise? Is there something MIL would like that isn\u2019t difficult to cook?", "ESH.  She does seem to be very rude but my understanding of Thanksgiving (I'm Australian) is that it's a day for family and being grateful for what you have.  So excluding her is not kind to her or, more importantly, her family.  You need to rise above it.  \n\nAlso, it may be worth sensitively exploring whether there is some kind of health issue she's worried about.  There may be types of food she's trying to avoid and a quiet conversation with her may resolve the situation where you can ensure there is actually enough for her to eat without making a big deal of it.  But even if she's just completely in the wrong, you should invite her and let her eat her own food.  It only reflects on her.", "NTA\n\n\nLet's be honest, do we think she is bringing only a small plate for herself only?

It sounds like you have reason to believe she is doing it to hurt you, and I\u2019m very sorry you have a MIL like that.\n\nIf it helps at all, I don\u2019t think the message other guests will get is that your cooking isn\u2019t up to snuff. I mean, they\u2019ll all be eating your menu and know for themselves if it is good.

Will it make you feel better to make her feel badly? or would it feel better to provide a fabulous meal and have everyone also see you are a fantastic and supportive person?

I also have food aversions and textures can be hard to work around. Let your MIL bring her own fking plate, you still made the whole meal whether everyone ate it or not. You still can be proud of yourself. But don\u2019t be the daughter-in-law that refused to let her to come to thanksgiving because she wanted to eat something else.

So it seems like she just picks and chooses what she \"likes\" or doesn't like depending on her mood.", "This is one of those situations where the MIL thinks she's embarassing OP but she's really embarrassing herself.

Just the other day there were dual posts from a guy and his gf who is recovering from an ED. Both mention being or getting engaged soon. Hearing about what they were serving, she thought she would likely have a problem trying the meal and asked if she could bring her own. And bf argued it was hugely rude and no one in his family would be able to understand and so she should stay home. So...what, exactly? She's just going to not ever be able to spend the holidays with his family unless she promises to eat their menu? Or at least for several years, consider The Holidays are annual? Bringing her own plate is enough to get her banned from the celebrations?\n\nI mean, OP, I think your menu sounds fantastic, but I don't think you even need to pay it any mind if she brings her own food. You have a fantastic spread and I feel like MIL is going to regret bring her own and struggle to not abandon it when presented with the feast you're going to lay out. At the very least, she's making herself into an odd minority person when everyone else will be enjoying the meal you prepared. Why go out of your way to be snarky about it? With all that food, you must be having quite a few people over--with all of them enjoying the food, don't you think you'll make yourself look kind of bad by focusing in on the one person who's already cast herself out of the group in this way?", "I LOVE the kill with kindness approach.

If that\u2019s the case, she\u2019d only be making HERSELF look bad. If she wants to look petty and classless, let her. If she wants to participate in a family gathering despite a tricky diet, also let her.

You don\u2019t have to eat the food, but you don\u2019t need to make a big deal about not eating either.\n\nThanksgiving is actually a good example because, while I\u2019ve become less picky as I got older, I still have some things I absolutely hate, and one of them is turkey.  If I am at someone else\u2019s table, I will fill up on other things and just accept a sliver of turkey if forced. (\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll have a little later;you know that I am not crazy about turkey, and I want to fill up on this delicious-looking whatever, first,\u201d only works with some people.)  I may have a couple of bites, or not.  The point is to make as little fuss as possible.\n\nBringing your own food to a social occasion is terribly rude. Aside from giving the message that the cooking isn\u2019t good enough, you are being rude to the other diners by not sharing your \u201csuperior\u201d food.\n\nHowever, one way around it is to insist on bringing a dish to share and eat mostly from it.  I do this whenever I can.  Sometimes I will bring bread, other times I will bring a corn casserole that works well with most meals.   \n\nThe MiL is, for some reason, trying to devalue OPs efforts to have a nice Thanksgiving.

Let\u2019s go there. I suddenly feel I can branch out for a little bit\u201d. It\u2019s a cycle for me. At least my sister (who usually cooks for thanksgiving) understands that and doesn\u2019t try to uninvite me just because I wanna eat McDonald\u2019s or a grilled cheese or something. Maybe because we\u2019re both autistic so she gets where my pickiness comes from\u2026", "I\u2019m not sure of the judgement but I will put my input from my personal experience with food: potlucks/food at other peoples places is hard for me. I accidently lowkey offended my mother in law the first time I met her because I stayed over at her house and didn\u2019t finish my food. She said something to my (then boyfriend now husband) in private and he had to tell her that I just had a small appetite and that I told him I really did love it, just couldn\u2019t finish it. It wasn\u2019t bad tasting at all, if I had cooked it myself or gotten it at a restaurant I probably would have liked it, I just have a hard time with food sometimes. I never said anything negative, I complimented her cooking, I just wasn\u2019t able to eat much physically.  \n\nI will get nauseous or completely un-hungry when I\u2019m in certain scenarios such as homemade potluck type things that can be messy like casseroles, greasy things like cheesy things, burgers or bacon, eating with a group of people especially if I don\u2019t know them well or it\u2019s high pressure (at school and work functions it was really difficult for me cause I looked like an anorexic for how little I ate). I lost a lot of weight (unhealthily) my first few years of college cause I basically stopped eating since all my meals were in group settings in the dining hall where I couldn\u2019t cook my own food. It was miserable. \n\nI eat like a pig when I cook for myself tho so I can see how it can look insensitive or passive aggressive. But it\u2019s a genuine, physical reaction for me. I cannot control it and I cannot choke the food down. I have literally gotten sick. I don\u2019t know what it is, I assume an extension of my anxiety disorder, but it is possible MIL has something similar.\n\nIdeally, she should be willing to try. I\u2019ve always tried at extended family gatherings or work functions etc. I can usually find something to nibble on that is safe like fruit or veggies and I\u2019ll grab a plate of a bite of everything to see whether it will agree with me. But that\u2019s never optimal for me. I\u2019m too socially anxious to do something like bring my own food (sounds more awk than eating nothing but cherry tomatoes and melon) but honestly if it works for her, I kinda think that\u2019s ok.  I would just let her do her thing. \n\nIf she is being genuinely rude by doing this, then she will embarrass herself, not you. If she\u2019s doing this as a form of self care, then you should prolly let her do her thing and just focus on all the compliments you will get from everyone else (and from your own taste buds!)", "I have ARFID. That sounds like ARFID.", "So I get it seems illogical and hurtful that you don\u2019t know why and thus default to \u2018she must hate my food/me\u2019 which is a thing humans do when they feel uncertain. And not knowing makes you feel uncertain.\n\nBut your MIL has lifelong issues with food and she also feels uncertain. She\u2019s asked to bring a plate to create certainty and because she might not know how to articulate this.\n\nI am simultaneously a very adventurous eater (bring on tripe, gizzards and whole fish) and a picky eater (burn ketchup and condiments in hell.) I have extremely strong textural issues with \u2018wet food\u2019 like a vegetable stew or sauces. I only worked out this year aged 44 it is linked to being tube fed as a seriously ill baby and not weaning naturally. Ding! My ARFID side of my eating disorder finally makes sense.\n\nBut my eating disorder and chronic illness wrecked my gut and I have 175+ foods and ingredients I can\u2019t eat. I\u2019m low FODMAP, fructose malabsorption, low fibre. The fructose is genetic like lactose. I see gastros, dietitians, had multiple surgeries, have been hospitalised from the wrong foods. I also have food allergies in there alongside intolerances.\n\nAnd I recently had a serious illness after a complicated appenditicitis. I had to have multiple colonoscopies etc and developed a bunch of new autoimmune stuff. Suddenly allergic to dogs because I had sepsis and it sent my body loopy. I\u2019m being investigated by allergists and checked for a histamine disorder. But since a different colonoscopy prep 3 months ago, all fish and seafood is making me puke. I love fish and seafood and it was a safe food. My gastro thinks the repeated prep damaged gut bacteria and it will hopefully settle. I can\u2019t keep up with myself so I either don\u2019t eat with people at all currently, cook or bring my own.\n\nMost people know I have medical reasons but because some is \u2018pickiness\u2019 (if that\u2019s how you view a mental illness like an ED) I am often talked about like you are calling your MIL while other people like your husband just go \u2018eh, whatever because I can\u2019t keep up\u2019 and others give me endless unsolicited advice or probing medical questions just to have lunch.\n\nI don\u2019t want to derail the meal into the me show where oh god we are now talking about my diarrhoea instead of the special lasagna. I don\u2019t want to talk about traumatising stuff like my ED, life threatening health, my nagging fear I have to give up fish, that I feel like a freak and a burden, that people assume I am attention seeking not disabled. I just want to share the table we are eating at and chat. I cook for a living and yes ouch when your best dish doesn\u2019t get universal adoration, but nothing does. Your house decor isn\u2019t going to be exalted by all the guests but you won\u2019t know because its not a decor day and your MIL isn\u2019t asking to bring different blinds to cope with yours.\n\nHonestly its damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t when you can\u2019t eat stuff. Someone always makes an issue. Sometimes its the person who can\u2019t eat anything. But almost always just grey rocking it makes better guest and host for everyone. I miss sharing the same meals. My partner and I still eat together and I love that he just goes \u2018ok\u2019 when I say \u2018oh this is not good right now\u2019 or \u2018oh this works.\u2019 For me it is literally certain brands of cereal for example are safe, others aren\u2019t as the ingredients vary. I feel like a fruit loop asking the equivalent of \u2018is it Kelloggs? No, can\u2019t then.\u2019 That\u2019s crucial to me but sounds like judging people\u2019s finances. I can\u2019t eat most prepared stock or broth as allergies are celery and mustard: that takes out whole meals like Thanksgiving. If I explain to a keen cook like you, you will probably try to make your own at huge extra hassle and cost and I can\u2019t predict if you plan to do the standard minus those allergens or go unique which might add in something I am intolerant to. \n\nBringing a plate is just the least worst way of getting round that often people are so keen to host well I will spend the rest of that day and days afterwards in the bathroom in agony. And if I eat say turkey and lock myself in the toilet, all your guests start panicking it is food poisoning and now your perfect brined turkey everyone admired is like an unexploded bomb and everyone remembers \u2018the year we thought OP poisoned us.\u2019\n\nHonestly in a spread like yours her plate won\u2019t even get noticed. Don\u2019t Streisand Effect yourself here. If she\u2019s going to draw attention, focus on that not the plate per se. Yoi are the host. That sets the tone not just the dishes and colour scheme. You can shut it down if she or others start and use the power for good instead of forcing compliance. People will still have preferences. You cooked a tonne. Most people won\u2019t try it all because it\u2019s physically a lot. Are you going to uninvite them? Do you get mad if someone doesn\u2019t have mashed potatoes because they don\u2019t \u2018go\u2019 with lasagne? You have probably overwhelmed yourself by hosting so much and are overloaded like MIL is. Like how you are both uncertain. Different sides of the same core feelings. Find compromise in that similarity and empathy. It will make your day easier than any fights over plates, with your husband etc who will never remember the lasagne Thanksgiving now as anything except \u2018oh the one you banned mom from?\u2019 That trumps any recipe trust me!\n\nNAH.

Safe foods mean *specifically* prepared *specific* foods that she knows she will not react to negatively. Sometimes that \u201cspecificity\u201d means it\u2019s prepared solely by themselves because it\u2019s also an anxious control thing.

If someone makes homemade food for you, the polite thing is to do is at least try it. Of course unless there is a reason they cant have it: allergies, ARFID, etc.  Hosts are usually extremely accommodating, so if the guest even knows the menu before hand, then the host is usually absolutely willing to make changes so their guest will have something they like! And if the guest doesnt know the menu beforehand then how would they know they wouldnt like anything there?  I dont think its something to get worked up over, but it would be hard for a host to not take it personally and think they arent a good enough cook or accommodating enough or that they wasted their time, money, and effort. Ive been to many gatherings where I ended not really liking the food but I still taste it and thank the host for going out of their way to make it.", "I agree what she eats is no ones business. It's the way, where, and when it's presented that is rubbing most people  the wrong way, I think. \n\n\nThe only reason the son knows of (which I'm presuming was the reason MIL gave) was that she's a picky eater and doesn't like OP's cooking. MIL is not required to disclose any reason for a dietary restriction, but giving a dislike of OP's cooking as the reason is an insult. Had that not been a given reason for bringing her own plate, this might be a very different conversation. Also, MIL's reasons and demands are being given to her son, rather than directly to OP. In my family the main person cooking is the 'host' of the event and any requests or concerns go through them.\n\n\nThanksgiving in the US for the most part has a set menu, most of which OP has listed in her edit. I'd be very surprised if MIL hasn't eaten most of this meal without complaint for most of her life, since that would have been mentioned or be a yearly thing and expected. \n\n\nFor instance, I can't stand turkey. Absolutely hate it. And nearly the entire meal revolves around the bird. My family and friends know this, so aren't surprised I won't touch anything with turkey in it on Thanksgiving. I just fill up on sides while still participating in the family get together part of the holiday. As a joke one year, I roasted a duck and brought it to Thanksgiving. The family laughed because I'd been campaigning for the Thanksgiving duck for years, and put it on the table next to the turkey. \n\n\nSo my dislike of a traditional Thanksgiving food is a long established fact. And the family worked with it. Had I been the host, there would have been a Thanksgiving duck, or ham, or roast, or even a goose if I could find one. Now, had it been an allergy or sensitivity, rather than a dislike, that food would never have been on the table. But an allergy,  sensitivity, or even a dislike to the traditional Thanksgiving meal would have come up before in MIL's case. It would have been mentioned if the MIL's Thanksgiving didn't include the traditional dishes too. So I'm left with the impression that MIL has a history of being fine with a traditional Thanksgiving meal, and is objecting now because OP is cooking/hosting.\n\n\nLast is the timing. Because of oven space, I know my family has already started prepping ingredients and dishes for Thanksgiving. If someone had a dietary preference or restriction, even a week ago might have been too late to completely accommodate them. But it often reflects poorly on the host to not try. And if this is OP's first time hosting, she's trying to do her best. \n\n\nIf I suddenly announced today that I'm vegan and can eat no animal products, my mother would get very annoyed. Not because of being vegan, but because our Thanksgiving is very NOT vegan. What's not covered in gravy is covered in cheese or butter. Sometimes all three. I honestly can't think of a vegan thing on our table except the cranberry sauce and the olive/pickle plate. But then she would do her best to come up with at least a couple vegan options. The last resort would be to let me know she had no time and THEN ask if I could bring my own food. It would then be no insult to my mother, which I would emphasize if I was asked about it. \n\n\nMIL seems to have announced she was bringing her own food at nearly the 11th hour, not given OP a chance to cater to any restrictions or sensitivities as the host, and only given her reasons as 'being a picky eater' of a yearly, highly traditional meal and that she doesn't like OP's cooking. Unless there is information missing it feels like a targeted slap against OP as a host. \n\n\nBased on your wording I'm guessing you aren't from the US. I understand your point, but I think you are missing some emphasis american culture puts on aspects of both  hosting and attending the Thanksgiving meal. It's the behavior more than the plate itself that I find rude. \n\n\nIf even if a guest had shown up on the day the her own plate and just said something like 'My stomach is sensitive so I brought my own food', a good host would have taken it, reheated it to a nice temperature, possibly have plated it on the same plates everyone else was using, and not said anything else about it to the other guests. Though a good host might also quietly enquire if any upcoming dishes might be acceptable or not to the guest so the guest isn't put on the spot later on. \n\n\nIt was the MIL's announcement so close to Thanksgiving, which she did through her son without any communication to OP, and with an aversion to OP's cooking and being picky as the only reasons given, that is so infuriating here. Not her wanting the plate. \n\nSorry for trying to work through my gut reaction with a super long comment.", "You\u2019re good people; ignore the downvoters!", "Exactly:  person first, food second. Even if I think it's weird that Dave only eats chicken tenders and fries, he's still my friend and I want to spend time with him. As long as he's willing to provide his own, I will welcome him at all gatherings, even if I plan on cooking for everyone else. It would be ridiculous to stop hanging out with Dave simply because he wants to eat something different.", "> She's providing her guest with all the options and new options a traditional Thanksgiving dinner would have. \n\nExcept the option to bring something", "Offering meat makes you a great host? Wow, the bar is low.", "Exactly!  It\u2019s not insulting, I\u2019m not being mean, I just don\u2019t like anything on your menu or maybe the way it\u2019s prepared.  I would only eat ham on that menu.  Possibly the mashed potatoes but creamy ones usually have some sort of cream cheese or something added and I wouldn\u2019t eat them then.  I literally can\u2019t swallow foods I don\u2019t like without watery eyes and a gag reflex and feeling generally nauseous\u2026 I just don\u2019t like it.  I am not insulting the host.  If MIL is like me she wishes she was less picky.", "By OPs logic people wouldn't be sharing a meal at a food court. Different cooks!", "Some of us hate thanksgiving with all of our beings.

Pretty much everything else has a pretty high chance of having one of the above in it because of butter, cheese, and flour.", "I am not so extreme, but a tiny bite turns into a huge ball in my mouth. I swallow it really struggling and won't touch the rest. I just push food around my plate then. Why are Americans so pushy with the food?", "Alternatively, but only if op is real sure about the pettiness on MIL's part, ask MIL a list of items she can and wants to eat. Op, like a good, concerned DIL will cater to that. Work with her real closely on that. \"Are you sure it's 45 seconds? Not 47? Goodness knows I don't want you to be uncomfortable.\"\n\nIf she plays her cards well, it will not backfire. Either MIL will squirm (how can she not look like an AH if DIL offered to cater to her needs?), or if her picky eating is actually true (and not an AH otherwise) appreciate the extra care.", "OOo yes, but maybe word it to say: DH said, \"You told him about\" some pretty severe dietary restrictions.

Though I do love Derry Girls. \ud83d\ude01", "I would very suprised if she only brought enough for herself. Her goal isn't to eat a special meal herself its clearly to steal the show from op.\n\nThat is why I wouldn't invite her at all.  if her husband doesn't have the spine to back her now he defintily won't ones mil shows up with a full turkey dinner. Ones she gets the OK to bring anything she will show up with a turkey. Then she will demand everyone try it. You know husband and others will take her side and say i don't want to cause a issue and try her food. Then if you give into that him and mom will take and agree saying you might as well put your dinner away and just serve his mom's to everyone because he doesn't want to cause a issue and they don't need to Thanksgiving meals. Plus there isn't enough room on the table and acording to mom its better food anyways.\n\n\nOp needs to end this now and not allow her to come.

It is very offensive.", "As a crazily picky eater myself, I bring my own food to family events all the time.  They aren\u2019t insulted.  I do it to make it easier on them.  I don\u2019t have to awkwardly sit there not eating and they don\u2019t have to cater to my very limited palette.  It\u2019s not meant to be insulting at all.  I totally acknowledge my pickiness is a pain in the ass and that I wish I wasn\u2019t a picky eater! I personally would eat only the honey glazed ham on that menu and that\u2019s only because it is honey glazed and not a different glaze.

Who exactly is benefited in that scenario?", "That comment just hurts my heart so much. Like, if MIL has any kind of disorder, whether it\u2019s diagnosed or not, treating her like that will just devastate her.\n\nBut it would solve OP\u2019s issue.
