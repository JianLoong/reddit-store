{"id": 3007, "submission_id": "z2c0nm", "title": "AITA for uninviting my MIL from Thanksgiving because she refuses to eat my cooking?", "selftext": "This year I (32F) am hosting Thanksgiving at my house and I have been working all month on coming up with the menu and testing all my recipes. I am so excited to share my cooking with my family and my husband (35M) has been supportive and helpful through all the planning and prepwork. I have bought all the ingredients and I have a beautiful variety of dishes planned (both traditional and a few unique additions).\n\nWell today my husband dropped the bombshell on me that his MIL wants to bring her own dinner to eat when she comes over. I asked him why she would need to bring her own food when I will have more than enough here. He just made excuses saying I know how his mother is a \"grade A picky eater\" and she won't \"like\" anything I have prepared. I thought that was ridiculous, I am not making anything unfamiliar to her and there will be plenty to choose from. He argued that her bringing her own dinner would be a good compromise and I disagree. It will be hugely obvious that she's making a comment on my cooking and it would be humiliating to have her there eating something completely different in front of everyone, it's like she's trying to make a point of showing that my cooking isn't good enough for her.\n\nI think she is being incredibly rude and disrespectful of the time, money, and labor I have put into this upcoming meal. I told him if she can't eat anything here then she is welcome to stay home and eat whatever she wants. My husband is now calling me insensitive and petty. He says I am ruining the holiday. I don't see it that way. I only want friends and family around who are appreciative and kind - I don't need the negativity of someone rejecting everything I've cooked and insulting my cooking when I've worked so hard.\n\nThis has truly been a labor of love and I took on this responsibility to share that love with my family and friends. AITA for not wanting my MIL to come if she's going to reject everything I've made?\n\n**TLDR:** My MIL is refusing to eat anything I cook at Thanksgiving and wants to bring her own personal meal, AITA for uninviting her?\n\n**EDIT:** Because some people are asking, here is what I plan on serving:(First all the traditional thanksgiving foods) roasted turkey, stuffing, classic creamy mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin, sweet potato casserole, green bean casserole, cranberry sauce, roasted carrots, homemade bread rolls with apple butter, roasted squash with goat cheese, honey glazed ham, braised short ribs, spinach, bacon, & feta cheese pies, special lasagna with white sauce, stuffed mushrooms, creamed corn with cheese, and then pecan pie, pumpkin pie, and apple pie for desserts. It's a lot!\n\nHow can there not be one thing she can eat?", "created_utc": 1669168401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2c0nm/aita_for_uninviting_my_mil_from_thanksgiving/", "score": 390, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell her it looks absolutely delicious and ask for her recipes and ask her is she could bring one of her wonderful dishes to the next gathering. \n\n  \nMeanwhile, you and your other guests can enjoy your fabulous meal and your MIL can listen to all the compliments you get for it.  \n\n\nNTA", "This post is driving me crazy bcuz just the other day a husband was complaining his picky eating wife would not eat his mother\u2019s Thanksgiving food and asked to bring her own food to which he said no and everyone got on him that he was the AH.

Im so confused.", "I am not American and in my culture this would be considered a slap in the face. Thus I may be a little bit biased but I think you are NTA and she is trying to be disrespectful unless she has some health or religious reasons not to eat your food. I am pretty sure she can tolerate someone else\u2019s cooking once a year.", "I feel like the majority of food issue AITA posts I read, the comments absolutely back the op wanting to bring their own food due to restriction, allergies, or preference. It's often suggested as a way to still go and enjoy without troubling the host to cater to 1 specific person. \n\nSo I'm really confused at all the comments against the MIL because OP perceives her actions as a slight. \nI think it's hard to say who TA is without more info backing up why OP thinks MIL is targeting her, and also why it matters so much...\n\n If she is trying to slight you, her eating the food and complaining about it will not make the holiday more enjoyable for you.

Not about forcing someone to eat what you have or don\u2019t eat at all. It\u2019s about being thankful for having each other around. As much as I love a good thanksgiving dinner, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s offensive for someone to be eating something else. I don\u2019t think this is a hill to die on honestly.

It would not bother me at all. There are several picky eaters in my family and when they come to my house for a meal it makes it easier for me when they bring something they can eat rather than having to work around their needs. They aren't looking for attention, they don't like that they're picky eaters, and they didn't choose to be picky eaters. There are just limited things that they can eat and so we accommodate that.\n\nWhen I host I want all of my guests to be comfortable.

Let it go.", "I never understood why it\u2019s rude that someone doesn\u2019t eat your food. As a picky eater itself, it\u2019s very rare for me to like stuff even if everyone else does.

I think it\u2019s worth having a conversation with your MIL about why she\u2019s bringing her own food. Does she have a dietary issue, allergy, special diet? For instance a friend of mine has celiac and can\u2019t risk cross contamination and will bring her own food. I\u2019m vegan, so in most instances I\u2019ll bring a couple of dishes to contribute to the meal that I know I can eat.\n\nEither way tho, if you let her bring her own food she\u2019ll have to explain to why and people will either understand if it\u2019s reasonable, or see that she\u2019s the AH.", "It sounds like you express your love for your people through food and event preparation which is awesome. However, that doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to reciprocate and value those things the same way. \n\nI get the request feels rude but was it really? She asked her son for permission and ahead of time.

Sounds like you're making it personal when it shouldn't be.", "Sorry, but YTA. She is not telling you what to make, she is not telling other people not to eat your food. She just knows what her safe foods are and is choosing to bring those, rather than bring the drama. You sound like you would create a scene if she did come without food, and then refused to eat yours. \n\nLet the rest of the family eat your food, and let the woman have her single plate of food she knows is safe.

Textures were a difficult thing for me. I have had people make me feel like sh*t for picking around ground beef in pasta sauce, saying I was wasting it. Trying new foods, being pressured into trying new foods, causes me to have severe anxiety. Your mother in law has her reasons. She\u2019s not asking you to cut off your left arm, she\u2019s asking to bring her own food so she can have dinner with her family without causing her anxiety and without causing you to do anything extra. Being patient, kind, and understand literally costs you nothing. You\u2019re the AH.

It's an easy kindness to have her (or anyone with food issues) bring her own food.

There may be some medical reason as to why your MIL can\u2019t eat your food and she does not have to disclose that to you or your husband.

Your MIL may have any number of reasons to not want to eat the food you are making, and it may very well have absolutely zero to do with you, and even if it does, her proposed compromise is adequate. \n\nSome people have medical dietary needs, sensory issues, some people have food insensitivities, some people plain just have preferences that can\u2019t be shaken. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you asked for dietary input from anyone who is attending. If your MIL was the AH, she would be telling you to change your food. Instead she is simply wanting to bring her own meal, something she would be comfortable with. And frankly, something I have done several times when I had strict medically necessary dietary restrictions. I have brought my own meals to WEDDINGS on the advice of my doctor, because I did not trust professional chefs to adequately prepare a special meal for my needs. And bringing my own food meant I could feel comfortable and safe and also enjoy the party instead of missing it.\n\nYour MIL isn\u2019t required to tell you the reason she wants to bring her own meal.

First for you demanding that everyone eat your food and then pitching a fit and uninviting her when your MIL wanted to bring her own meal. MIL is an AH because she won't talk to you about what the issue is and why she needs to bring her own food.

Your menu clearly shows you're putting a lot of effort in.\n\nHowever, perspective from the other side, I have gone hungry a lot at other people's houses, even when there was good in front of me that I like to or normally would eat. \n\nOne reason is weird random food issues. I found out that it was autistic last month (literally last month) at almost 40 and that explains a lot of this, but what happens for me is that for reasons absolutely unknown some days certain smells, textures, or even the look of a food triggers off a gag reflex in me. It can be a food I love and I just can not eat it without vomiting. \n\nThe other is that, these days, I have gut issues, and now I have to be super careful with what I eat but a lot of people don't get it. One of my weirds, as an example, is that I'm allergic to yeast and, for some fucking reason, people keep trying to feed sourdough and gluten free food (hint: gluten free and yeast free are not the same thing). People also don't realise that yeast is found in so many basic cooking ingredients like soy sauce and vinegars. Yeast is one of 5 dietary allergies, and on top of that I have specialised 'my body is fucked' dietary restrictions on top of that.

I am so excited to share my cooking with my family and my husband (35M) has been supportive and helpful through all the planning and prepwork. I have bought all the ingredients and I have a beautiful variety of dishes planned (both traditional and a few unique additions).\n\nWell today my husband dropped the bombshell on me that his MIL wants to bring her own dinner to eat when she comes over. I asked him why she would need to bring her own food when I will have more than enough here. He just made excuses saying I know how his mother is a \"grade A picky eater\" and she won't \"like\" anything I have prepared. I thought that was ridiculous, I am not making anything unfamiliar to her and there will be plenty to choose from. He argued that her bringing her own dinner would be a good compromise and I disagree. It will be hugely obvious that she's making a comment on my cooking and it would be humiliating to have her there eating something completely different in front of everyone, it's like she's trying to make a point of showing that my cooking isn't good enough for her.\n\nI think she is being incredibly rude and disrespectful of the time, money, and labor I have put into this upcoming meal. I told him if she can't eat anything here then she is welcome to stay home and eat whatever she wants. My husband is now calling me insensitive and petty. He says I am ruining the holiday. I don't see it that way. I only want friends and family around who are appreciative and kind - I don't need the negativity of someone rejecting everything I've cooked and insulting my cooking when I've worked so hard.\n\nThis has truly been a labor of love and I took on this responsibility to share that love with my family and friends. AITA for not wanting my MIL to come if she's going to reject everything I've made?\n\n**TLDR:** My MIL is refusing to eat anything I cook at Thanksgiving and wants to bring her own personal meal, AITA for uninviting her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "INFO is she just picky or have a sensory issue like AFRID, or sensitive to certain spices that are common? \n\nIf she\u2019s just picky then she is TA. But sometimes, especially with older adults, there is an undiagnosed sensory disorder with food that makes certain textures and flavors repulsive for no reason. My sister has AFRID and couldn\u2019t eat rice for years, as well as a a lot of meats because of the texture. I also have a distant relative that had food poisoning so bad from someone else\u2019s cooking that she nearly died, and now will only eat food she cooked herself, years later.\n\nIs there a compromise? Is there something MIL would like that isn\u2019t difficult to cook?", "ESH.  She does seem to be very rude but my understanding of Thanksgiving (I'm Australian) is that it's a day for family and being grateful for what you have.  So excluding her is not kind to her or, more importantly, her family.  You need to rise above it.  \n\nAlso, it may be worth sensitively exploring whether there is some kind of health issue she's worried about.  There may be types of food she's trying to avoid and a quiet conversation with her may resolve the situation where you can ensure there is actually enough for her to eat without making a big deal of it.  But even if she's just completely in the wrong, you should invite her and let her eat her own food.  It only reflects on her.", "NTA\n\n\nLet's be honest, do we think she is bringing only a small plate for herself only?

Or perhaps a sickness she\u2019s not disclosing?", "While I do think your MIL is being shitty and rude, I have to go with a very gentle ESH. It is your husbands thanksgiving too, and if all she does wrong is bring her own food, however frustrating, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say he can\u2019t have his mom there.\n\nPeople with allergies, special diets, picky eaters all bring their own meals to family events. It\u2019s not always intended to be rude. It sounds like you have reason to believe she is doing it to hurt you, and I\u2019m very sorry you have a MIL like that.\n\nIf it helps at all, I don\u2019t think the message other guests will get is that your cooking isn\u2019t up to snuff. I mean, they\u2019ll all be eating your menu and know for themselves if it is good.

Sorry, if your first thought is if she brings her own food is a statement that your food is not good enough then you are insecure. Let her bring her own food. Don\u2019t make a big deal about it. Sounds like you will have plenty of people that will enjoy your food. Let her salivate on her pettiness while she eats the stuff she brings for herself while the rest of your guest enjoy your food.

Will it make you feel better to make her feel badly? or would it feel better to provide a fabulous meal and have everyone also see you are a fantastic and supportive person?

OP you wrote a lot about YOU planned, YOU did, YOU YOU YOU but isn't Thanksgiving supposed to be about celebrating family, friends, and being thankful ?

If she was bringing enough to feed everyone else that would be an issue but if it\u2019s just her, so what? Don\u2019t let her \u2018win\u2019 by even bringing it up or anything because you will just be making more drama out of a situation you get to look like the bigger person and a great cook.", "YTA. I struggled with an eating disorder for a long time and while I consider myself recovered now, some things- like going to someone\u2019s home and eating an entire meal that I don\u2019t know the process of making or what it\u2019s ingredients are-  can be difficult and stressful. I also have food aversions and textures can be hard to work around. Let your MIL bring her own fking plate, you still made the whole meal whether everyone ate it or not. You still can be proud of yourself. But don\u2019t be the daughter-in-law that refused to let her to come to thanksgiving because she wanted to eat something else. Is this really the hill you\u2019re willing to die on?", "This is one of those things that make me wonder why people seem to want to have conflict in their lives when they could just be happy.

I hate a certain holiday dish thats common in my husband's and I' s culture ( I don't even eat it when my family makes it) and I have sensory stuff with food.\n\nI ate before going over to my in laws once because I didn't want to waste food or make them feel like they needed to cater to my sensory stuff. This was seen as insulting to my mil but the alternative was not going over for the holiday which I thought would be worse", "Not that I know of. My husband says she's always been a fussy eater. So it seems like she just picks and chooses what she \"likes\" or doesn't like depending on her mood.", "This is one of those situations where the MIL thinks she's embarassing OP but she's really embarrassing herself. OP, consider how good you will feel as you watch her get more and more uncomfortable eating her special meal.\nAnd consider that if you uninvited her with no explanation you will look like an asshole, if she brings her own food she will look like an idiot.", "As funny and satisfying as this sounds when I imagine it as say a holiday movie, I'm not sure why there's even a need for it.\n\nThere have been quite a few posts about both sides of this on AITA since the holiday season kicked into gear. Just the other day there were dual posts from a guy and his gf who is recovering from an ED. Both mention being or getting engaged soon. Hearing about what they were serving, she thought she would likely have a problem trying the meal and asked if she could bring her own. And bf argued it was hugely rude and no one in his family would be able to understand and so she should stay home. So...what, exactly? She's just going to not ever be able to spend the holidays with his family unless she promises to eat their menu? Or at least for several years, consider The Holidays are annual? Bringing her own plate is enough to get her banned from the celebrations?\n\nI mean, OP, I think your menu sounds fantastic, but I don't think you even need to pay it any mind if she brings her own food. You have a fantastic spread and I feel like MIL is going to regret bring her own and struggle to not abandon it when presented with the feast you're going to lay out. At the very least, she's making herself into an odd minority person when everyone else will be enjoying the meal you prepared. Why go out of your way to be snarky about it? With all that food, you must be having quite a few people over--with all of them enjoying the food, don't you think you'll make yourself look kind of bad by focusing in on the one person who's already cast herself out of the group in this way?", "I LOVE the kill with kindness approach.

If that\u2019s the case, she\u2019d only be making HERSELF look bad. If she wants to look petty and classless, let her. If she wants to participate in a family gathering despite a tricky diet, also let her.

You don\u2019t have to eat the food, but you don\u2019t need to make a big deal about not eating either.\n\nThanksgiving is actually a good example because, while I\u2019ve become less picky as I got older, I still have some things I absolutely hate, and one of them is turkey.  If I am at someone else\u2019s table, I will fill up on other things and just accept a sliver of turkey if forced. (\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll have a little later;you know that I am not crazy about turkey, and I want to fill up on this delicious-looking whatever, first,\u201d only works with some people.)  I may have a couple of bites, or not.  The point is to make as little fuss as possible.\n\nBringing your own food to a social occasion is terribly rude. Aside from giving the message that the cooking isn\u2019t good enough, you are being rude to the other diners by not sharing your \u201csuperior\u201d food.\n\nHowever, one way around it is to insist on bringing a dish to share and eat mostly from it.

ESH", "This person is excluding her husband's loved one from a holiday because only HER food that SHE is excited to cook is allowed to be eaten, and if you disagree with that you're not welcome in HER house at HER holiday dinner table. I don't really see why you think \"oh, if only husband had told her, she'd have totally made what MIL told her to make\". That's not in character with the behavior she's showing at all. But even if she was willing, that didn't happen, and she shouldn't be insulted that other people don't like her food. Like, you don't own their tastebuds, and your husband being around his loved ones is more important.", "Yup that\u2019s it. You know all the answers . What\u2019s her name since you know her so well?", "So it\u2019s less rude to not eat than to bring food you can eat?\n\nAlso I disagree with the notion that them spending time on making the menu means I need to only eat it. If you really planned the menu you\u2019d have asked me whether I\u2019d like it or not.", "I\u2019m just going by what was written in the post. None of us knows if she has any dietary needs. You\u2019re assuming something that isn\u2019t in the post. I\u2019m not saying she couldn\u2019t have them, but that\u2019s not what the post said.", "Playing devil advocate so don\u2019t blow a gasket just a POSSIBILITY \nMAYBE OP is NOT as good a cook as she thinks. Hubby NOT going to tell her and others are being polite. \nI have an aunt by marriage and CAN\u2019T cook a lick but ALWAYS wants to host or bring a dish. ONLY her kids and hubby eats what she brings so her dish is eaten out of and her feelings are not hurt that NOBODY ate her food. Her dishes just sit there looking abandoned sooooo maybe MIL in her rude way just can\u2019t fake the funk anymore \ud83d\ude02", "Based on her description of her meal, do you think she would be open to another dish being brought?", "Except with toddlers, I have never experienced it.  As I said, usually people who are picky or have special diets will just bring a dish to share with everyone.", "The mother can eat what's there or not attend.  She's just picky, not allergic. \n\nShe sounds rather dramatic and a real pain in the arse.", "Quite literally 3rd hand info from someone who is biased against them and has no clue, why would/should she have to disclose her medical issues with everyone? \n\nFor all you know she has an allergy and OP cooking will contaminate the entire meal for her, no matter the reason she should not be forced to eat just because OP wants them to", "I hadn't really considered this angle (also sucks to be your aunt).\n\nSince we know she's had OP's cooking it's definitely possible, and from what I could glean MIL didn't ask what she was serving or what was on the menu, so if it's just a blanket \"she's a bad cook\" it really wouldn't matter, would it?\n\nBUT this still isn't the best way to go about it. I'd offer to bring ONE dish with enough for everyone, under the guise of wanting to contribute. Then at least all the guests could eat \ud83d\ude02", "Omg this is my family! My brother and SIL always insist on hosting and my SIL clearly puts effort into the food\u2026but it is NEVER good. My brother knows the rest of the family doesn\u2019t like it but he insists we\u2019re wrong. We\u2019ve all offered to host or to bring dishes and we\u2019re all shut down hard. \nNow the rest of us have a tradition of hitting up the Jack in the box on the way out of their neighborhood.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nFor the past 5 years or so, there\u2019s also been a \u201cshadow\u201d thanksgiving where everyone meets the day after and brings their best dishes and ITS AMAZING. \nI get this is hurtful to OP but if her husband is already upset, she runs a real risk of alienating other members of his family.", "Yea that was my initial thought too I have family and friends who LOVE to host parties and have huge spreads\u2026and I\u2019d rather die than eat their cooking. Sometimes when I\u2019m on the toilet after the fact I do feel like I\u2019m dying, especially when it comes up and out. Now I just avoid it or push around the food and claim I can\u2019t eat it for whatever reason (due to meds, a health problem, I have X thing after and can\u2019t be full, etc). Now its somewhat doubtful as OP has said she\u2019s eaten her cooking before, but maybe this is the straw that broke the camels back? I have a friend who cannot properly cook anything without burning it. Everything is black charred and dry as a desert, her bf will take it to the grave that she isn\u2019t the best cook he\u2019s ever met.", "You can\u2019t really eat stuff you don\u2019t like though? Or at least you shouldn\u2019t. \n\nDefinitely agree on the drama though, who immediately assumes they won\u2019t like the food?!?", "It sucks to have to eat my aunt\u2019s food. She has been regulated to sodas and ice!\ud83d\ude02 we don\u2019t even trust her NOT to find a way to mess up store bought cake \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "And what if the reason is because she has an allergy so the whole kitchen and meal is contaminated so what she brings is the only thing she can eat", "Girl my aunt will NEVER host a thanksgiving the most she could do was take the meat to the kitchen as her husband took it off the grill when they would host a bbq once a year but we STILL had to bring the sides \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
