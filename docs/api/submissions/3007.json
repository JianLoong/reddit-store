{"id": 3007, "submission_id": "z2c0nm", "title": "AITA for uninviting my MIL from Thanksgiving because she refuses to eat my cooking?", "selftext": "This year I (32F) am hosting Thanksgiving at my house and I have been working all month on coming up with the menu and testing all my recipes. I am so excited to share my cooking with my family and my husband (35M) has been supportive and helpful through all the planning and prepwork. I have bought all the ingredients and I have a beautiful variety of dishes planned (both traditional and a few unique additions).\n\nWell today my husband dropped the bombshell on me that his MIL wants to bring her own dinner to eat when she comes over. I asked him why she would need to bring her own food when I will have more than enough here. He just made excuses saying I know how his mother is a \"grade A picky eater\" and she won't \"like\" anything I have prepared. I thought that was ridiculous, I am not making anything unfamiliar to her and there will be plenty to choose from. He argued that her bringing her own dinner would be a good compromise and I disagree. It will be hugely obvious that she's making a comment on my cooking and it would be humiliating to have her there eating something completely different in front of everyone, it's like she's trying to make a point of showing that my cooking isn't good enough for her.\n\nI think she is being incredibly rude and disrespectful of the time, money, and labor I have put into this upcoming meal. I told him if she can't eat anything here then she is welcome to stay home and eat whatever she wants. My husband is now calling me insensitive and petty. He says I am ruining the holiday. I don't see it that way. I only want friends and family around who are appreciative and kind - I don't need the negativity of someone rejecting everything I've cooked and insulting my cooking when I've worked so hard.\n\nThis has truly been a labor of love and I took on this responsibility to share that love with my family and friends. AITA for not wanting my MIL to come if she's going to reject everything I've made?\n\n**TLDR:** My MIL is refusing to eat anything I cook at Thanksgiving and wants to bring her own personal meal, AITA for uninviting her?\n\n**EDIT:** Because some people are asking, here is what I plan on serving:(First all the traditional thanksgiving foods) roasted turkey, stuffing, classic creamy mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin, sweet potato casserole, green bean casserole, cranberry sauce, roasted carrots, homemade bread rolls with apple butter, roasted squash with goat cheese, honey glazed ham, braised short ribs, spinach, bacon, & feta cheese pies, special lasagna with white sauce, stuffed mushrooms, creamed corn with cheese, and then pecan pie, pumpkin pie, and apple pie for desserts. It's a lot!\n\nHow can there not be one thing she can eat?\n\n**UPDATE:** Omg there's a lot of replies, thank you all for weighing in. I've been reading all your responses and have been thinking a lot - and as much as it hurts my feelings, I think the kill her with kindness route will be the best thing to do. I am so overwhelmed and exhausted and I just want to have a perfect Thanksgiving for everyone. I will let her know she is welcome and will ignore her and focus on my other guests. I won't let her ruin my day and will be the bigger person. That's what family does, as much as I will be irritated on the inside...(who knows maybe she will try something and like it! - but if she doesn't that's okay too)", "created_utc": 1669168401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2c0nm/aita_for_uninviting_my_mil_from_thanksgiving/", "score": 8260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here's what you do: Welcome her and her special meal with open arms. Kill her with kindness.\n\nBe sure to point out to the other guests, in a lovey dovey, if perhaps a wee bit patronizing, tone of voice how MIL has ~~special needs~~ dietary restrictions and brought her own food and you are SO GLAD she could make it even though eating away from home is so difficult for her. Offer to help her heat up her meal. Tell her it looks absolutely delicious and ask for her recipes and ask her is she could bring one of her wonderful dishes to the next gathering.\n\nMeanwhile, you and your other guests can enjoy your fabulous meal and your MIL can listen to all the compliments you get for it.\n\nNTA\n\n**\\*\\*UPDATE:\\*\\***  \nHey, thanks for all the upvotes ad groovy awards, people! After reading a bunch of comments I want to clarify that I didn't mean \"special needs\" as in neuro-divergence, I meant it like \"special dietary needs.\" So I edited that above. My kid and I are both neuro-divergent, so I don't mean to use that like an insult. Sorry about that. My bad.\n\nAlso, I was basing the whole patronizing, somewhat passive-aggressive stuff on MIL doing this because she's trying to put down the OP, but I realize I don't have confirmed evidence of that.\n\nSo...INFO: OP, does MIL do this to everyone? Does she refuse to eat other people's cooking or restaurant food as a general rule, or is her \"pickiness\" targeted at you or other people she doesn't like for whatever reason? Because if she's like this everywhere, I'd cut her some slack. Maybe she has undisclosed health issues, mental or otherwise, that genuinely make this hard for her.\n\nIf it's just targeted at you and she eats normally in all other circumstances, than passive-aggressive at her to your heart's content. :) I'm glad you didn't uninvite MIL, OP. I think it will go fine. Just relax and do your thing and don't worry about her nonsense. PLEASE REPORT BACK!\n\nCarry on, and Happy Thanksgiving everyone!", "This post is driving me crazy bcuz just the other day a husband was complaining his picky eating wife would not eat his mother\u2019s Thanksgiving food and asked to bring her own food to which he said no and everyone got on him that he was the AH. His wife tried to compromise and was she supposed to starve? This post is the exact opposite, basically the MIL is the wife from that post and now MIL is the AH? Im so confused.", "I am not American and in my culture this would be considered a slap in the face. Thus I may be a little bit biased but I think you are NTA and she is trying to be disrespectful unless she has some health or religious reasons not to eat your food. I am pretty sure she can tolerate someone else\u2019s cooking once a year.", "I feel like the majority of food issue AITA posts I read, the comments absolutely back the op wanting to bring their own food due to restriction, allergies, or preference. It's often suggested as a way to still go and enjoy without troubling the host to cater to 1 specific person. \n\nSo I'm really confused at all the comments against the MIL because OP perceives her actions as a slight. \nI think it's hard to say who TA is without more info backing up why OP thinks MIL is targeting her, and also why it matters so much...\n\n If she is trying to slight you, her eating the food and complaining about it will not make the holiday more enjoyable for you. It just won't, and that's what you'll be getting if she comes without her own meal.", "INFO - Explain \"grade A picky eater\" in comparison to your menu. For example:\n\nAre you making turkey?

Not about forcing someone to eat what you have or don\u2019t eat at all. It\u2019s about being thankful for having each other around. As much as I love a good thanksgiving dinner, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s offensive for someone to be eating something else. I don\u2019t think this is a hill to die on honestly.

She's the one behaving strangely, any judgement will be passed on her, not you.\n\nBe the bigger person. Be the classy, generous hostess, spoil the rest of your guests with delicious food, make no comment on MILs behavior, and rise above. \n\n(Also, is it possible that she has a genuine food issue? Such as a sensory thing causing her to struggle with foods? Those do exist, and they're not always diagnosed. If so, going to eat at someone else's house can be a terrifying prospect, and bringing her own food allows her to enjoy the holiday with everyone without having the anxiety about if she'll be able to eat anything.)", "INFO: Would it be worth confirming foods she actually likes and adding it to your menu?

The fact that she\u2019s planning on hating your food is weird. \n\nHave you had issues with her in the past?", "I really do not understand this \"bringing your own meal is rude\" thing. It would not bother me at all. There are several picky eaters in my family and when they come to my house for a meal it makes it easier for me when they bring something they can eat rather than having to work around their needs. They aren't looking for attention, they don't like that they're picky eaters, and they didn't choose to be picky eaters. There are just limited things that they can eat and so we accommodate that.\n\nWhen I host I want all of my guests to be comfortable. If that means they bring something that they can eat I'm happy with it.", "INFO: is this something she has done before? If she regularly brings her own food to large family events, then I would let it go.\n\n\nYTA, since your MIL does this for most large gatherings, you taking it so personally is unreasonable. The point of holidays should be to come together and celebrate the company of family and friends. Your MIL bringing her own plate will not detract from that unless you let it.", "Kind of YTA. Like who cares? Just have thanksgiving, if someone doesn\u2019t want to eat your food, let them eat whatever. If you don\u2019t make a big deal out of it, I don\u2019t think it will be one.", "YTA OMG this is not a \"bombshell.\" Such an overreaction. What is the BFD? Let her bring her own plate. Who cares?

Let it go.", "I never understood why it\u2019s rude that someone doesn\u2019t eat your food. As a picky eater itself, it\u2019s very rare for me to like stuff even if everyone else does. Who cares if one person doesn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s one thing if she\u2019s making a show if it telling everyone you\u2019re a bad cook. Other than that you\u2019re letting your ego get in the way.", "Well if this isn\u2019t a complete about-face. Can\u2019t believe the NTA responses.

I think it\u2019s worth having a conversation with your MIL about why she\u2019s bringing her own food. Does she have a dietary issue, allergy, special diet? For instance a friend of mine has celiac and can\u2019t risk cross contamination and will bring her own food. I\u2019m vegan, so in most instances I\u2019ll bring a couple of dishes to contribute to the meal that I know I can eat.\n\nEither way tho, if you let her bring her own food she\u2019ll have to explain to why and people will either understand if it\u2019s reasonable, or see that she\u2019s the AH.", "It sounds like you express your love for your people through food and event preparation which is awesome. However, that doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to reciprocate and value those things the same way. \n\nI get the request feels rude but was it really? She asked her son for permission and ahead of time.

Why don\u2019t you have a conversation with her before going nuclear? Your relationship is bigger than one day and you both need to have a conversation.", "From what you've written, YTA. Thanksgiving is about family, not food. You may be excited to share your cooking, but you're being unreasonable. Her not liking your cooking has nothing to do with family or the holiday. Sounds like you're making it personal when it shouldn't be.", "Sorry, but YTA. She is not telling you what to make, she is not telling other people not to eat your food. She just knows what her safe foods are and is choosing to bring those, rather than bring the drama. You sound like you would create a scene if she did come without food, and then refused to eat yours. \n\nLet the rest of the family eat your food, and let the woman have her single plate of food she knows is safe.

Trying new foods, being pressured into trying new foods, causes me to have severe anxiety. Your mother in law has her reasons. She\u2019s not asking you to cut off your left arm, she\u2019s asking to bring her own food so she can have dinner with her family without causing her anxiety and without causing you to do anything extra.

I found out that it was autistic last month (literally last month) at almost 40 and that explains a lot of this, but what happens for me is that for reasons absolutely unknown some days certain smells, textures, or even the look of a food triggers off a gag reflex in me. It can be a food I love and I just can not eat it without vomiting. \n\nThe other is that, these days, I have gut issues, and now I have to be super careful with what I eat but a lot of people don't get it.

People also don't realise that yeast is found in so many basic cooking ingredients like soy sauce and vinegars. Yeast is one of 5 dietary allergies, and on top of that I have specialised 'my body is fucked' dietary restrictions on top of that.

I am so excited to share my cooking with my family and my husband (35M) has been supportive and helpful through all the planning and prepwork. I have bought all the ingredients and I have a beautiful variety of dishes planned (both traditional and a few unique additions).\n\nWell today my husband dropped the bombshell on me that his MIL wants to bring her own dinner to eat when she comes over. I asked him why she would need to bring her own food when I will have more than enough here. He just made excuses saying I know how his mother is a \"grade A picky eater\" and she won't \"like\" anything I have prepared. I thought that was ridiculous, I am not making anything unfamiliar to her and there will be plenty to choose from. He argued that her bringing her own dinner would be a good compromise and I disagree. It will be hugely obvious that she's making a comment on my cooking and it would be humiliating to have her there eating something completely different in front of everyone, it's like she's trying to make a point of showing that my cooking isn't good enough for her.\n\nI think she is being incredibly rude and disrespectful of the time, money, and labor I have put into this upcoming meal. I told him if she can't eat anything here then she is welcome to stay home and eat whatever she wants. My husband is now calling me insensitive and petty. He says I am ruining the holiday. I don't see it that way. I only want friends and family around who are appreciative and kind - I don't need the negativity of someone rejecting everything I've cooked and insulting my cooking when I've worked so hard.\n\nThis has truly been a labor of love and I took on this responsibility to share that love with my family and friends. AITA for not wanting my MIL to come if she's going to reject everything I've made?\n\n**TLDR:** My MIL is refusing to eat anything I cook at Thanksgiving and wants to bring her own personal meal, AITA for uninviting her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "INFO is she just picky or have a sensory issue like AFRID, or sensitive to certain spices that are common? \n\nIf she\u2019s just picky then she is TA. But sometimes, especially with older adults, there is an undiagnosed sensory disorder with food that makes certain textures and flavors repulsive for no reason. My sister has AFRID and couldn\u2019t eat rice for years, as well as a a lot of meats because of the texture. I also have a distant relative that had food poisoning so bad from someone else\u2019s cooking that she nearly died, and now will only eat food she cooked herself, years later.\n\nIs there a compromise? Is there something MIL would like that isn\u2019t difficult to cook?", "ESH.  She does seem to be very rude but my understanding of Thanksgiving (I'm Australian) is that it's a day for family and being grateful for what you have.  So excluding her is not kind to her or, more importantly, her family.  You need to rise above it.  \n\nAlso, it may be worth sensitively exploring whether there is some kind of health issue she's worried about.  There may be types of food she's trying to avoid and a quiet conversation with her may resolve the situation where you can ensure there is actually enough for her to eat without making a big deal of it.  But even if she's just completely in the wrong, you should invite her and let her eat her own food.  It only reflects on her.", "NTA\n\n\nLet's be honest, do we think she is bringing only a small plate for herself only?  Or will she bring enough to share and make others feel like they havw to eat her food to not hurt her feelings?\n\n\nCause it sounds like the latter.", "INFO: does your MIL have an eating disorder? Or perhaps a sickness she\u2019s not disclosing?", "While I do think your MIL is being shitty and rude, I have to go with a very gentle ESH. It is your husbands thanksgiving too, and if all she does wrong is bring her own food, however frustrating, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say he can\u2019t have his mom there.\n\nPeople with allergies, special diets, picky eaters all bring their own meals to family events. It\u2019s not always intended to be rude. It sounds like you have reason to believe she is doing it to hurt you, and I\u2019m very sorry you have a MIL like that.\n\nIf it helps at all, I don\u2019t think the message other guests will get is that your cooking isn\u2019t up to snuff. I mean, they\u2019ll all be eating your menu and know for themselves if it is good. If anything, they will look at your MIL poorly, if she is acting childishly about something like thanksgiving dinner.

Sorry, if your first thought is if she brings her own food is a statement that your food is not good enough then you are insecure. Let her bring her own food. Don\u2019t make a big deal about it. Sounds like you will have plenty of people that will enjoy your food. Let her salivate on her pettiness while she eats the stuff she brings for herself while the rest of your guest enjoy your food. And by chance she can\u2019t resist after seeing everyone enjoy your food, wouldn\u2019t that be the best??", "I have the feeling MIL is planning to show up with an entire meal - like a whole turkey, a serving bowl of mashed potatoes, etc.\n\nIf she is gonna be so petty, there is no way she shows up with a single serving of dinner or a slice of pie.\n\nHer plan is to entice others to eat her food.", "YTA-grow up.

Will it make you feel better to make her feel badly? or would it feel better to provide a fabulous meal and have everyone also see you are a fantastic and supportive person?

OP you wrote a lot about YOU planned, YOU did, YOU YOU YOU but isn't Thanksgiving supposed to be about celebrating family, friends, and being thankful ?

If she was bringing enough to feed everyone else that would be an issue but if it\u2019s just her, so what? Don\u2019t let her \u2018win\u2019 by even bringing it up or anything because you will just be making more drama out of a situation you get to look like the bigger person and a great cook.", "YTA. I struggled with an eating disorder for a long time and while I consider myself recovered now, some things- like going to someone\u2019s home and eating an entire meal that I don\u2019t know the process of making or what it\u2019s ingredients are-  can be difficult and stressful. I also have food aversions and textures can be hard to work around. Let your MIL bring her own fking plate, you still made the whole meal whether everyone ate it or not. You still can be proud of yourself. But don\u2019t be the daughter-in-law that refused to let her to come to thanksgiving because she wanted to eat something else. Is this really the hill you\u2019re willing to die on?", "This is one of those things that make me wonder why people seem to want to have conflict in their lives when they could just be happy.  So what if she brings her own meal?

I hate a certain holiday dish thats common in my husband's and I' s culture ( I don't even eat it when my family makes it) and I have sensory stuff with food.\n\nI ate before going over to my in laws once because I didn't want to waste food or make them feel like they needed to cater to my sensory stuff. This was seen as insulting to my mil but the alternative was not going over for the holiday which I thought would be worse", "Not that I know of. My husband says she's always been a fussy eater. So it seems like she just picks and chooses what she \"likes\" or doesn't like depending on her mood.", "This is one of those situations where the MIL thinks she's embarassing OP but she's really embarrassing herself. OP, consider how good you will feel as you watch her get more and more uncomfortable eating her special meal.\nAnd consider that if you uninvited her with no explanation you will look like an asshole, if she brings her own food she will look like an idiot.", "As funny and satisfying as this sounds when I imagine it as say a holiday movie, I'm not sure why there's even a need for it.\n\nThere have been quite a few posts about both sides of this on AITA since the holiday season kicked into gear. Just the other day there were dual posts from a guy and his gf who is recovering from an ED. Both mention being or getting engaged soon. Hearing about what they were serving, she thought she would likely have a problem trying the meal and asked if she could bring her own. And bf argued it was hugely rude and no one in his family would be able to understand and so she should stay home. So...what, exactly? She's just going to not ever be able to spend the holidays with his family unless she promises to eat their menu? Or at least for several years, consider The Holidays are annual? Bringing her own plate is enough to get her banned from the celebrations?\n\nI mean, OP, I think your menu sounds fantastic, but I don't think you even need to pay it any mind if she brings her own food. You have a fantastic spread and I feel like MIL is going to regret bring her own and struggle to not abandon it when presented with the feast you're going to lay out. At the very least, she's making herself into an odd minority person when everyone else will be enjoying the meal you prepared. Why go out of your way to be snarky about it? With all that food, you must be having quite a few people over--with all of them enjoying the food, don't you think you'll make yourself look kind of bad by focusing in on the one person who's already cast herself out of the group in this way?", "I LOVE the kill with kindness approach.

You don\u2019t have to eat the food, but you don\u2019t need to make a big deal about not eating either.\n\nThanksgiving is actually a good example because, while I\u2019ve become less picky as I got older, I still have some things I absolutely hate, and one of them is turkey.  If I am at someone else\u2019s table, I will fill up on other things and just accept a sliver of turkey if forced.

I accidently lowkey offended my mother in law the first time I met her because I stayed over at her house and didn\u2019t finish my food. She said something to my (then boyfriend now husband) in private and he had to tell her that I just had a small appetite and that I told him I really did love it, just couldn\u2019t finish it. It wasn\u2019t bad tasting at all, if I had cooked it myself or gotten it at a restaurant I probably would have liked it, I just have a hard time with food sometimes. I never said anything negative, I complimented her cooking, I just wasn\u2019t able to eat much physically.  \n\nI will get nauseous or completely un-hungry when I\u2019m in certain scenarios such as homemade potluck type things that can be messy like casseroles, greasy things like cheesy things, burgers or bacon, eating with a group of people especially if I don\u2019t know them well or it\u2019s high pressure (at school and work functions it was really difficult for me cause I looked like an anorexic for how little I ate). I lost a lot of weight (unhealthily) my first few years of college cause I basically stopped eating since all my meals were in group settings in the dining hall where I couldn\u2019t cook my own food. It was miserable. \n\nI eat like a pig when I cook for myself tho so I can see how it can look insensitive or passive aggressive. But it\u2019s a genuine, physical reaction for me. I cannot control it and I cannot choke the food down. I have literally gotten sick. I don\u2019t know what it is, I assume an extension of my anxiety disorder, but it is possible MIL has something similar.\n\nIdeally, she should be willing to try. I\u2019ve always tried at extended family gatherings or work functions etc. I can usually find something to nibble on that is safe like fruit or veggies and I\u2019ll grab a plate of a bite of everything to see whether it will agree with me. But that\u2019s never optimal for me. I\u2019m too socially anxious to do something like bring my own food (sounds more awk than eating nothing but cherry tomatoes and melon) but honestly if it works for her, I kinda think that\u2019s ok.  I would just let her do her thing. \n\nIf she is being genuinely rude by doing this, then she will embarrass herself, not you. If she\u2019s doing this as a form of self care, then you should prolly let her do her thing and just focus on all the compliments you will get from everyone else (and from your own taste buds!)", "I have ARFID. That sounds like ARFID.", "So I get it seems illogical and hurtful that you don\u2019t know why and thus default to \u2018she must hate my food/me\u2019 which is a thing humans do when they feel uncertain. And not knowing makes you feel uncertain.\n\nBut your MIL has lifelong issues with food and she also feels uncertain. She\u2019s asked to bring a plate to create certainty and because she might not know how to articulate this.\n\nI am simultaneously a very adventurous eater (bring on tripe, gizzards and whole fish) and a picky eater (burn ketchup and condiments in hell.) I have extremely strong textural issues with \u2018wet food\u2019 like a vegetable stew or sauces. I only worked out this year aged 44 it is linked to being tube fed as a seriously ill baby and not weaning naturally. Ding! My ARFID side of my eating disorder finally makes sense.\n\nBut my eating disorder and chronic illness wrecked my gut and I have 175+ foods and ingredients I can\u2019t eat. I\u2019m low FODMAP, fructose malabsorption, low fibre. The fructose is genetic like lactose. I see gastros, dietitians, had multiple surgeries, have been hospitalised from the wrong foods. I also have food allergies in there alongside intolerances.\n\nAnd I recently had a serious illness after a complicated appenditicitis. I had to have multiple colonoscopies etc and developed a bunch of new autoimmune stuff. Suddenly allergic to dogs because I had sepsis and it sent my body loopy. I\u2019m being investigated by allergists and checked for a histamine disorder. But since a different colonoscopy prep 3 months ago, all fish and seafood is making me puke. I love fish and seafood and it was a safe food. My gastro thinks the repeated prep damaged gut bacteria and it will hopefully settle. I can\u2019t keep up with myself so I either don\u2019t eat with people at all currently, cook or bring my own.\n\nMost people know I have medical reasons but because some is \u2018pickiness\u2019 (if that\u2019s how you view a mental illness like an ED) I am often talked about like you are calling your MIL while other people like your husband just go \u2018eh, whatever because I can\u2019t keep up\u2019 and others give me endless unsolicited advice or probing medical questions just to have lunch.\n\nI don\u2019t want to derail the meal into the me show where oh god we are now talking about my diarrhoea instead of the special lasagna. I don\u2019t want to talk about traumatising stuff like my ED, life threatening health, my nagging fear I have to give up fish, that I feel like a freak and a burden, that people assume I am attention seeking not disabled. I just want to share the table we are eating at and chat. I cook for a living and yes ouch when your best dish doesn\u2019t get universal adoration, but nothing does. Your house decor isn\u2019t going to be exalted by all the guests but you won\u2019t know because its not a decor day and your MIL isn\u2019t asking to bring different blinds to cope with yours.\n\nHonestly its damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t when you can\u2019t eat stuff. Someone always makes an issue. Sometimes its the person who can\u2019t eat anything. But almost always just grey rocking it makes better guest and host for everyone. I miss sharing the same meals. My partner and I still eat together and I love that he just goes \u2018ok\u2019 when I say \u2018oh this is not good right now\u2019 or \u2018oh this works.\u2019 For me it is literally certain brands of cereal for example are safe, others aren\u2019t as the ingredients vary. I feel like a fruit loop asking the equivalent of \u2018is it Kelloggs? No, can\u2019t then.\u2019 That\u2019s crucial to me but sounds like judging people\u2019s finances. I can\u2019t eat most prepared stock or broth as allergies are celery and mustard: that takes out whole meals like Thanksgiving. If I explain to a keen cook like you, you will probably try to make your own at huge extra hassle and cost and I can\u2019t predict if you plan to do the standard minus those allergens or go unique which might add in something I am intolerant to. \n\nBringing a plate is just the least worst way of getting round that often people are so keen to host well I will spend the rest of that day and days afterwards in the bathroom in agony. And if I eat say turkey and lock myself in the toilet, all your guests start panicking it is food poisoning and now your perfect brined turkey everyone admired is like an unexploded bomb and everyone remembers \u2018the year we thought OP poisoned us.\u2019\n\nHonestly in a spread like yours her plate won\u2019t even get noticed. Don\u2019t Streisand Effect yourself here. If she\u2019s going to draw attention, focus on that not the plate per se. Yoi are the host. That sets the tone not just the dishes and colour scheme. You can shut it down if she or others start and use the power for good instead of forcing compliance. People will still have preferences. You cooked a tonne. Most people won\u2019t try it all because it\u2019s physically a lot. Are you going to uninvite them? Do you get mad if someone doesn\u2019t have mashed potatoes because they don\u2019t \u2018go\u2019 with lasagne? You have probably overwhelmed yourself by hosting so much and are overloaded like MIL is. Like how you are both uncertain. Different sides of the same core feelings. Find compromise in that similarity and empathy. It will make your day easier than any fights over plates, with your husband etc who will never remember the lasagne Thanksgiving now as anything except \u2018oh the one you banned mom from?\u2019 That trumps any recipe trust me!\n\nNAH.

It's the way, where, and when it's presented that is rubbing most people  the wrong way, I think. \n\n\nThe only reason the son knows of (which I'm presuming was the reason MIL gave) was that she's a picky eater and doesn't like OP's cooking. MIL is not required to disclose any reason for a dietary restriction, but giving a dislike of OP's cooking as the reason is an insult. Had that not been a given reason for bringing her own plate, this might be a very different conversation. Also, MIL's reasons and demands are being given to her son, rather than directly to OP. In my family the main person cooking is the 'host' of the event and any requests or concerns go through them.\n\n\nThanksgiving in the US for the most part has a set menu, most of which OP has listed in her edit. I'd be very surprised if MIL hasn't eaten most of this meal without complaint for most of her life, since that would have been mentioned or be a yearly thing and expected. \n\n\nFor instance, I can't stand turkey. Absolutely hate it. And nearly the entire meal revolves around the bird. My family and friends know this, so aren't surprised I won't touch anything with turkey in it on Thanksgiving. I just fill up on sides while still participating in the family get together part of the holiday. As a joke one year, I roasted a duck and brought it to Thanksgiving. The family laughed because I'd been campaigning for the Thanksgiving duck for years, and put it on the table next to the turkey. \n\n\nSo my dislike of a traditional Thanksgiving food is a long established fact. And the family worked with it. Had I been the host, there would have been a Thanksgiving duck, or ham, or roast, or even a goose if I could find one. Now, had it been an allergy or sensitivity, rather than a dislike, that food would never have been on the table. But an allergy,  sensitivity, or even a dislike to the traditional Thanksgiving meal would have come up before in MIL's case. It would have been mentioned if the MIL's Thanksgiving didn't include the traditional dishes too. So I'm left with the impression that MIL has a history of being fine with a traditional Thanksgiving meal, and is objecting now because OP is cooking/hosting.\n\n\nLast is the timing. Because of oven space, I know my family has already started prepping ingredients and dishes for Thanksgiving. If someone had a dietary preference or restriction, even a week ago might have been too late to completely accommodate them. But it often reflects poorly on the host to not try. And if this is OP's first time hosting, she's trying to do her best. \n\n\nIf I suddenly announced today that I'm vegan and can eat no animal products, my mother would get very annoyed. Not because of being vegan, but because our Thanksgiving is very NOT vegan. What's not covered in gravy is covered in cheese or butter. Sometimes all three. I honestly can't think of a vegan thing on our table except the cranberry sauce and the olive/pickle plate. But then she would do her best to come up with at least a couple vegan options. The last resort would be to let me know she had no time and THEN ask if I could bring my own food. It would then be no insult to my mother, which I would emphasize if I was asked about it. \n\n\nMIL seems to have announced she was bringing her own food at nearly the 11th hour, not given OP a chance to cater to any restrictions or sensitivities as the host, and only given her reasons as 'being a picky eater' of a yearly, highly traditional meal and that she doesn't like OP's cooking. Unless there is information missing it feels like a targeted slap against OP as a host. \n\n\nBased on your wording I'm guessing you aren't from the US. I understand your point, but I think you are missing some emphasis american culture puts on aspects of both  hosting and attending the Thanksgiving meal. It's the behavior more than the plate itself that I find rude. \n\n\nIf even if a guest had shown up on the day the her own plate and just said something like 'My stomach is sensitive so I brought my own food', a good host would have taken it, reheated it to a nice temperature, possibly have plated it on the same plates everyone else was using, and not said anything else about it to the other guests. Though a good host might also quietly enquire if any upcoming dishes might be acceptable or not to the guest so the guest isn't put on the spot later on. \n\n\nIt was the MIL's announcement so close to Thanksgiving, which she did through her son without any communication to OP, and with an aversion to OP's cooking and being picky as the only reasons given, that is so infuriating here. Not her wanting the plate. \n\nSorry for trying to work through my gut reaction with a super long comment.", "You\u2019re good people; ignore the downvoters!", "Exactly:  person first, food second. Even if I think it's weird that Dave only eats chicken tenders and fries, he's still my friend and I want to spend time with him.

It's pretty common (especially with that amount of dishes) for guests to bring food to Thanksgiving. So the fact that OP is so upset as to uninvite over this makes me think they're kind of a control freak and snob (over people having their own opinions on the food). Even the fact that in the edit op says she's going to \"kill her with kindness\" and \"ignore\" her indicates that she's still turning this into a feud rather than just understanding that somebody can not like something she made while still liking her and thinking she did a good job.

My MIL is a kind and wonderful person.  \n\nThere are certain things she just won't eat.  Over the years I have learned these things and I cook some things the exact way she likes it even though it makes the dish worse because of it.  Then, there are some dishes that I just fib a little about what's in them.  I want to be clear that I've been in this family for 15 years and I'm not risking her health.   If she was to say \"are there mushrooms in this gravy?\" I would say yes...  but if she asks me how I made the gravy, I might just forget to mention the I tossed some dehydrated mushrooms in and liquefied them with with the immersion blender.  \n\nAnyway my point is that it's very possible that this is a real hangup she has and that she is struggling.   Unless you have other issues with her, this may not be about you or your cooking at all.  \n\nI would let her bring her food and then just tell her that you really want your guests to have a day off from cooking, and you would love to get ideas from her on how you can prepare foods that feel safe to her so she doesn't have to go to so much work next time.  Tell her you love her and you want her to feel pampered, not to have an extra chore.", "Do you actually know she means it as an insult? Maybe she is worried about ingredients and wants to keep to a certain diet. \n\nAs someone who has an ED, I typically will not eat most foods at thanksgiving.", "NAH. It\u2019s understandable why you\u2019d feel slighted, but MIL just may have some reason she needs special foods and she\u2019s not quite willing to share the why yet.

So just let her do it. How does this hurt you?", "NAH - I was picky due to undiagnosed food allergies. I now bring my food everywhere. MIL might also have this or she might be rude. It took DECADES to be diagnosed. Also who cares what they eat? It's just a time to be with family. Is it really that important to you that everyone validate you?\n\n\nAlso literally everything on your list has allergens in it except the turkey.

I am a VERY picky eater and I've choked down what were probably many finely cooked meals simply because I didn't like it.  Also, when I cook, I cook the way I like it, so I always tell people the only way they can insult me is to eat something they don't like.  So I get both sides.    The bottom line is that she's an older lady (I assume) and if it makes her happy to bring her own thing, than just let it go.\n\nNow, not to be insulting, but you also have to consider too that even with all the work, it doesn't mean you're making something that people love.", "Are you sure she doesn\u2019t have other issues and needs \u201csafe\u201d foods?

If someone especially a family member did that to me, I would make a scene. You\u2019re being rude. I want to be there. I want to eat your food but my body will not allow it. This is supposed to be a holiday where you\u2019re supposed to enjoy peoples company and be grateful that they are there, so why are you making it so that she doesn\u2019t wanna be there? Why do you have such a problem with your MIL? She could have an eating disorder, she could be autistic, but you\u2019re going to exclude her because you are taking some offense over her, wanting to bring her own food that she\u2019s not even talking about sharing with anyone?

I have family members who don't, but when we had big Thanksgiving gatherings, we had both Turkey and Ham...don't like either of those, there are a ton of side dishes.\n\nBUT, if someone said, hey, I don't really eat turkey or ham, mind if I bring in some fried chicken.....well sure, whatever.  Might be good if you brought in a big thing of it to share though.\n\nI do know some very picky eaters get very anxious about these things....'I know what I like and I'm concerned I won't like what they have'....but I make sure I'm not too hungry when I go to those things, so if I need to go a few hours without, I do...or I eat fruit or whatever.  I recognize that some people may not, and may really want to sit down and eat with everyone else.  While I think she should 'just deal with it', I also understand that it sucks if you don't like any of the stuff on the table and would rather just bring your own stuff to be safe.\n\nSo I kind of think this is an ESH situation.  She could suck it up for a day, and maybe like it, you could be a little more understanding....it isn't a reflection on your or your cooking, but rather on her anxiety around food.", "Wow.

And then the passive aggressive \"kill them with kindness\" - ugh, how about just actually be nice?", "Would it be considered more or less rude than not eating anything at all.", "I'd just also emphasize that reason for the \"dietary needs\" doesn't have to be disclosed or medically endorsed.\n\nYour medical records is private. For example, if the medication I'm taking causes nausea and I find I can only eat basic soup, I should not be required to disclose that the reason I'm eating soup is due to medication (which will likely lead to followup questions about that).\n\nMeanwhile, just because it's not a doctor giving the reason doesn't mean it's not valid. For example, if I eat Swiss cheese I throw up. I shouldn't have to come up with a medical reason for you to believe that. I probably shouldn't even have to explain that I throw up. You should believe me when I say it make me feel terrible. \n\nLastly, some restrictions are just related to personal values. The idea that a person should splurge because the host thinks they should and otherwise they need evidence of medical danger is ridiculous. If I'm on a strict diet I found myself to manage a weight issue or I practice precise control over what nutrients I get or what ingredients I can have and the host provides all foods that don't fit that diet, I should be able to just eat something else. I shouldn't be required to break my goals because they think it's no big deal even if it's not life or death. \n\nI say all this particularly in the case of OP where the MIL checked in advance so she had time to come up with a solution (her own food).

Why cannot OP just accept her preference and just be happy that family can enjoy holiday together?", "And make sure she eats from a special plate, totally different from everyone else. To ensure her safety and no cross contamination!!!", "Why would OP be entitled to know any of that information? What if MIL doesn\u2019t even fully understand it yet?\n\nI knew I had food issues and they got categorized by everyone around me and by me as being \u201cpicky\u201d long before I knew I had ADHD and IBS. Now that I know what a FODMAP is and it\u2019s a thing I\u2019m supposed to avoid and only eat in moderation I\u2019m actually a very adventurous eater since I don\u2019t just get mysteriously sick anymore after meals.\n\nAnd woman MIL\u2019s age are far less likely to be diagnosed with things or comfortable talking about it if they are. As a younger millennial with a group of other neurodivergent friends, it\u2019s pretty easy for me to say \u201cI have sensory issues with this\u201d or to say \u201cthat\u2019s a major trigger food for my IBS/Im having a bad stomach week and have to be extra good about my medical diet right now.\u201d And in 90% of situations Im happy to say \u201cI can\u2019t eat that or I will be shitting for the next 5 hours.\u201d Most women in their 50s-60s, if they even had access to that personalized insight about why they gave food issues, have internalized shame associated with being neurodivergent (especially around clearly uninformed people like OP) and would rather die than talk about their bowl movements with people. So instead, either out of ignorance, decorum, or shame, the label \u201cpicky\u201d is what is most often used as a catch all for all kinds of situations. \n\nJust let people bring a plate and stop acting like paranoid assholes over it.", "No child deserves that.", "'By' and 'with' are not tense specific.\n\nThe exact words are: \"For 'tis the sport to have the engineer hoist with his own petard; and 't shall go hard, but I will delve one yard below their mines, and blow them at the moon.\"", "I've defended my PhD once to a 'jury' of my betters. I thought those days were long behind me, so have decided to bow out, get a glass of wine (LARGE) and try never to think of this again. Especially on Reddit, which is supposed to be FUN.\n\n*Goodnight, sweet prince.*", "Here's the thing. It is an insult to you only if you choose to look at it that way.  It is no reflection on you or your cooking. If she is picky in general about what she eats, then this is a way for her to be present, enjoy everyone's company and still have food. Think of it this way. If she had allergies, and had to bring her own food because she was allergic to the ingredients in what you were cooking, would you begrudge her bringing her own food? Maybe it would be better if she expected you to cater the meal to her needs and not make what you planned? Or would she be thoughtful to say \" Don't change anything for me, I will take care of my own food and come for the company\". Change YOUR thought process and the insult goes away ( this said by someone allergic to dairy, soy wheat and nuts, turkey and chicken - how much do you think I get to eat when we go over to someone's house for Thanksgiving if I don't bring something for myself?)", "If a turkey came through the door and was served I'd send him home with his mama because he is clearly a mama's boy and not a husband. Husband's have a spine. I'd tell him that before his mom arrives so that he can act accordingly. \n\nHe thinks mama is a rock and spouse is the soft spot so she needs to make him understand that he is between a rock and a hard spot and his decisions/choices have long term consequences for both of them.", "Yup, it should be that way. Especially with family. Shouldn't you want your family to feel comfortable and be able to have a meal, even if that means something special??? It's not hard to be accommodating for people who have established food issues. Even if all that accommodation is is letting them bring their own food. Offer to let MIL bring a dish that she would like to eat to share with others. That's what I do whenever there's a meal involved in a gathering. I offer to bring something along that I can eat that other people can share. It's not hard. It's not ever meant as an insult to anyone. It's just me trying to be able to participate in an event and eat a meal like everyone else gets to."]}
