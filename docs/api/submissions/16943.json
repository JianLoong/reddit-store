I don't know how he thinks you can afford to send money back... What does he do?  How much does his name a year?", "NTA - But understand this is a deal breaker in many cultures.", "NAH, you're incompatible", "NTA\n\nIf you're going to marry someone who has family living in a poor country then it's going to be a constant issue with money.\n\nRun now if you're not willing for him to send money back to his family. I'm not just talking about medical bill there will be living expenses, holidays, gifts, loans, and even money for other relatives.", "NAH. As a practical matter, setting this policy IS being the one who always has to say no because it doesn\u2019t stop anyone from asking. It also means not financially helping anyone you love when they are in need. And if that\u2019s what you\u2019re comfortable with, then it is better to be honest about this now (and would have been best before engagement) rather than after a wedding.", "Don\u2019t apply for fianc\u00e9 visa if you guys don\u2019t agree on this. \nI am an immigrant. It is not about poor country or culture. It is about human nature. I think it is universal. If you can get money from your family just by asking , they will always depend on you. They will not work hard and will not have aspirations or ambitions. \nKudos to you for having this conversation earlier. \nDon\u2019t compromise on finances. \n\nNTA", "A lot if times in these kinds of \"mixed\" relationships you're marrying their family, from a financial support standpoint.", "INFO\n\n> Today we were talking about our financial expectations in marriage. He told me he would want to send money back home to pay for his brother\u2019s medical bills.\n\nIsn't he talking about *his* money here?\n\nJust don't mix finances, right?", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to support his family. If he comes to the US and makes a lot to send back, that\u2019s fine. But it\u2019s not your responsibility.", "Sounds like you have some incompatible financial goals. Maybe try living together for awhile first to see if this will really work out? Or be sure to sign a pre-nup\u2026", "Lol you ARE a poor people, 50k and less is poverty wages\n\nAlso NTA, you aren't a bank. No joint accounts. You're absolutely right that it seeds resentment. \n\nFor what it's worth I am a poor people and I wouldn't expect a spouse to pay for a family members medical bills.", "Run far and fast.. he\u2019s not even married to you and hitting you up for cash for his \u201cpoor deprived family\u201d? Girl run!!! In all likelihood this is a long running scam.", "NTA but it\u2019s normal for immigrants to send money to family. I\u2019m Filipino and all my relatives send money to the Philippines because the money goes a long way and they need it. Family is everything. Maybe if he does come to the US and finds a job as a graphic designer you can work it out that he would use his money to send, not yours. But if you were to be married money lines become blurred and it would be money from the household going to his family.", "NAH but also you should seriously consider that you have pretty different beliefs. He is the selfless type that feels he is responsible for his whole family and you are the more selfish type that thinks you are only responsible for yourself. Neither of you are TA for feeling the way you feel, but that's a huge issue to be so split on. You do not sound compatible at all in this respect, and if you stay together, I guarantee he will find a way to send them as much money as possible.", "NTA. \nCould you discuss in couples therapy how to handle finances? There are different ways of drawing that up so that you both feel heard, and values are aligned. Either way before processing into a marriage, read the laws in your state. Not sure where you live but if you understand what finances become each others (including debt) property etc through marriage, you can engage an attorney to create a prenup - a way of writing the law to apply to your specific marriage.", "Maybe you could tell him any money sent back would be from his bank account only and that he needs to make sure he fulfilled his financial obligations in your shared space first. Do not share a bank account with him as you will see your money disappear. And that\u2019s not me calling him a thief, but usually when people have families that know they are marrying an American, they will ask for a lot of money and he will probably send more than what you are comfortable with. It happens all the time so you need to protect yourself financially. If you choose to marry him, get a prenup. He makes way less than you and considering he\u2019s already making plans for YOUR money for his family is alarming already. But I see your comment that he does love you so the best of luck. I hope you guys can find a solution.", "You both aren\u2019t compatible!\n\nHe will always want to send money to family. You will always not want to. \n\nYou are not compatible", "NTA.  However, the two of you need to have some very firm understanding prior to considering marriage.  Does he work and live in the U.S.?  If not, it may be his goal to have a life where his family gets paid for by his wife.  You two need to have these conversations and that is important for your (potential) marriage.", "If you really want to stay with him, you make the financials very very clear and you agree on them. Have three separate accounts - yours, his, and household. You each contribute to the household account for bills, savings, vacations, emergencies, etc. you can decide to contribute based on income levels, etc. the remainder goes into your own personal accounts. You have free reign over your own individual accounts. He is free to spend his personal money on his family, and you can spend yours as you see fit. So he needs to determine how much he can send back home based on how much extra personal spending cash he wants to have. But household account comes first. You don\u2019t have to spend your personal money on his fam and he doesn\u2019t get to give you grief on how you spend your personal money. Just know that he will feel like there is an imbalance bc he will most likely have less personal money to spend on himself than you have. But again, that\u2019s his choice - give his personal money to the fam back home and deal with less money for himself. But it doesn\u2019t impact your household.", "He can do whatever he wants with his spare money after all your share household expenses are paid. You can\u2019t ask him not to send his own money. But he can\u2019t expect you to send your money to his family or to finance that in anyway. If he does then he wants to mooch off you and you should run away. \n\nNTA", "NAH - It helps to think of an engagement as your last chance before marriage to figure out whether you're fundamentally compatible. When you find a conflict in something huge, like money or children, you have to lean into that issue to figure out if it's a dealbreaker before you're legally tied to another person. This is doubly so if you'd need to sponsor someone's visa to proceed with the marriage. You mentioned anxiety about sharing a bank account in the comments; your gut is telling you to pay attention!", "I mean, what if your parents couldn\u2019t afford their medical bills? Would you help, or would that be \u201csacrificing your lifestyle\u201d? Some people are worth spending money on. You don\u2019t always have to send money to everyone for everything, but YTA for wanting to set a blanket policy like this", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My bff went through this and it costed them thousands of dollars.", "NAH- I think you would need to actually sit down and figure out how much he wants to send to his brother for his medical bills. Find an agreed upon amount that would be ok to send, figure out an absolute max for any emergencies. \nWrite down your future goals with your finances.

Earns $1000 a month which is a good salary for his country", "40k in a year is a huge amount of money for Eastern Europe and for most of the world actually.

I would grow resentful.", "Yes, I am sure people will still ask. And he will have difficulty saying no.", "Thanks for the insight from an immigrant and for making me feel better about bringing this conversation up.", "I really do not want that.", "He likes the idea of having one joint bank account. If we are going to make this relationship work though, I definitely think separate accounts is the way to go.", "We can\u2019t because they won\u2019t give him a visa unless we are married. Yes, definitely would want a pre-nup", "Exactly!", "Yes, his aunt married an American and consistently sends money back.", "Yes, this is what I am concerned about.

Are you sure he's not trying to scam you for a green card and/or money?", "$40K a year is close to poverty level in the US.", "> It's very privileged to think of that as a low salary.\n\nIn the US, 40k breaks down to $3,333 per month, probably before tax. Rent can easily take 1/3 or even 2/3 of that. Then add in insurance, transportation, utilities, and food, and there's very little left.\n\nSo no, it's not a low salary, per se, but it's not a very high one either.", "But I bet your rent isn\u2019t $1000+ a month, and you don\u2019t spend $300 a month on healthcare.", "I'm also an immigrant from Eastern Europe. The case of the family not working as hard as they can because they can get the money from you isn't true for everyone. For us it is a cultural expectation that family helps family. There are of course mooches, but in general it's just the accepted norm. And it's an expectation that children take care of their parents in old age.\nSounds like you guys are just incompatible to be honest. If he had high salary prospects I would say talk about having separate finances, but you might end up carrying the brunt of your household finances in that case, while he sends his money home.", "Then think real hard about marrying him\u2026coz a lot of people assume that feelings about having a joint account changes after the wedding..even if he agrees now there is a possibility he might wanna change his decision in the future and there is a very likely possibility you will resent him.", "That's the joke when men get \"mail order\" brides.", "> He likes the idea of having one joint bank account.\n\nYeah, the poor person usually does.", "This info makes you NTA in my opinion. It would be different if he was planning to move to the US, get a higher-paying job and send a portion of his income to his family. In that case, I would recommend a joint account + separate accounts and whatever he chooses to do with his separate account is up to him. But if he only wants to have a joint account you have the right to decide what that money should be spent on.", "Financial disagreements are one of the top 5 reasons for divorce in the US right now. If you two are already butting heads over money you should think long and hard before mixing up bank accounts and filing joint tax returns.", "And that's why I gave you the judgement I did.   \n\n\nI would suggest, however, that you think about the type of person he is, that he would fight to provide for his family (slightly larger than the family you have envisioned), and how his current family would likely be of similar stock and would probably be there for you in any way that they could. Keep in mind, though you come from the middle class, that could be erased in a heartbeat.   \n\n\nNow imagine if he works to get his family to come here. Imagine they get here and all of them work hard to make their lives better (a common trait of immigrants to the US, especially in Eastern Europeans). They might end up better off than you and making a lot more than you. Wouldn't it be great if you found yourself on hard times, but you had such a family to fall back on? Food for thought.", "Honestly I would be incredibly cautious with this.  If he comes over you are financially responsible for him, any crimes he commits, medical costs, etc.  These are concerning signs.", "Yes, met him 7 years ago on a study abroad. He definitely loves me", "Yes, the thought of having a joint bank account with him makes me very anxious", "Yes, being financially responsible for him makes me nervous", "Based on that, you would have been really young.

But none of those should be yours.", "OP if you have ever watched 90 Day Fiance on a regular basis, money is the #1 issue that arises once the couples get married and it all boils down to sending it back home to their families because often times it's an idea in the back of their mind to help them with finances.  I dealt with someone who was from Europe and told me that when we got married that I would need to sign everything over to them in my will, which was a nonstarter and ceased further contact.  It's also a challenge of you to have a valid prenup since you're responsible for him if the visa gets approval.", "Have you been transparent about your salary and budget? I would write everything in a spreadsheet, and show him your income/expenditures. Some things are very cheap in Eastern Europe that aren't here, i.e. he may think your electricity/water is like $10 a month.", "Yes, I\u2019ve gone back to visit him 6 times and lived with him while my college was online due to the pandemic.", "If you're married and you're sending money back to extended family, it's coming from you ***and*** your spouse, regardless of how much you try to separate your finances. It impacts you both financially. If one party isn't on board, it's a recipe for disaster."]}
