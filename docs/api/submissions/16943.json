There are different ways of drawing that up so that you both feel heard, and values are aligned. Either way before processing into a marriage, read the laws in your state.

Do not share a bank account with him as you will see your money disappear. And that\u2019s not me calling him a thief, but usually when people have families that know they are marrying an American, they will ask for a lot of money and he will probably send more than what you are comfortable with. It happens all the time so you need to protect yourself financially. If you choose to marry him, get a prenup.

You have free reign over your own individual accounts. He is free to spend his personal money on his family, and you can spend yours as you see fit. So he needs to determine how much he can send back home based on how much extra personal spending cash he wants to have. But household account comes first. You don\u2019t have to spend your personal money on his fam and he doesn\u2019t get to give you grief on how you spend your personal money. Just know that he will feel like there is an imbalance bc he will most likely have less personal money to spend on himself than you have. But again, that\u2019s his choice - give his personal money to the fam back home and deal with less money for himself. But it doesn\u2019t impact your household.", "He can do whatever he wants with his spare money after all your share household expenses are paid. You can\u2019t ask him not to send his own money.

If he does then he wants to mooch off you and you should run away. \n\nNTA", "NAH - It helps to think of an engagement as your last chance before marriage to figure out whether you're fundamentally compatible. When you find a conflict in something huge, like money or children, you have to lean into that issue to figure out if it's a dealbreaker before you're legally tied to another person. This is doubly so if you'd need to sponsor someone's visa to proceed with the marriage. You mentioned anxiety about sharing a bank account in the comments; your gut is telling you to pay attention!", "I mean, what if your parents couldn\u2019t afford their medical bills?

So if someone close to you in the future came to you for financial help, would you be fine rejecting them given you had your fiance do the same? \n\nHowever YTA for looking down on your future husband, so not cool, especially when having separate accounts is such an easy fix. \n\nI hope you both consider this relationship going forward.", "If the US dollar goes so far, why do they need more? How many income streams do they need?", "It d\u00e9pends of location of course but yes. For the same price we bought our house, we could bmhave bought a tiny studio in Paris, a small flat in a major town in France, an average house like ours (3bd, 1bathr, a big yard) on the suburbs or a big villa with pool on a more remote area.\nI make 28k, my husband 40k, we bought our house 11 years ago but we made less money, maybe 40-45 for the 2 of us at this time m.\nIf we want to buy a house now with our salaries and with the same conditions (financial input) we could still easily buy a house.", "Especially depending on region. Northern California here. Rent on a 1-bedroom is around 3k. So your 40k earner would have nothing left at all after paying rent and income taxes. I guess food is a luxury now.", "Why are you forgetting the vast majority of the world's population? Only 17% of the world's population lives in high income countries like the ones you mentioned. For instance the average montly salary in India is $573, in Vietnam  $275, in Brazil $267 and in China $1283.", "$1000 per month rent?! Maybe for a room in a shared house if you\u2019re lucky. Even in low COL cities, that won\u2019t rent you a house for a family", "People hate being called out on their shit. Especially when their ignorant ass bigots", "Oh honey.. no. You're a meal ticket", "Did you have to save up for a down payment from your salaries and then use your salaries to pay off a loan? Because here you can probably pay off a loan with these salaries instead of paying rent but saving up for a downpayment would take forever.", "Oh, yeah! From the other side it seems like a crazy amount of money!", "But this couple isn\u2019t living in Vietnam so I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s relevant to this story", "> I (24F) come from an upper middle class family **_in the US_**\n\nI'm sorry you were saying?", "Most of the world isn't living in low income countries, they're living in middle income countries.\n\nI used those statistics because they're the most comparable to the US which is also considered a high income country. \n\nYeah, sure, people in poorer countries would be so happy to have $40,000 USD per year because they make jack shit. Just like how Australians would love the median American salary because the conversion rate means more money for us. It doesn't mean that $40,000 USD is just automatically a fuck ton of money since there's poor countries. It's still a barely livable wage in the US let alone other countries like it. \n\nThat's like saying if you have to skip meals or work 12 hour shifts you shouldn't complain because there's people out there who are starving or working 16+ hours. If you complain you're privileged because there's someone out there that has it worse than you. It's really stupid to think like this.", "You don\u2019t need to have a joint account necessarily. But you should probably get a prenup if you do decide to move forward with this relationship", "I am not complaining but the point is that 40k is still a lot of money for most people living in the world.", "Sure, and if it were possible for this person to keep their $40k job and move to a lower COL country, that might be great. But living in the US on $40k means that if you get sick, you may not be able to pay for your medical treatment and may go bankrupt and lose your home. So that can be a very stressful position to be in."]}
