There are different ways of drawing that up so that you both feel heard, and values are aligned. Either way before processing into a marriage, read the laws in your state.

Do not share a bank account with him as you will see your money disappear. And that\u2019s not me calling him a thief, but usually when people have families that know they are marrying an American, they will ask for a lot of money and he will probably send more than what you are comfortable with. It happens all the time so you need to protect yourself financially. If you choose to marry him, get a prenup.

You have free reign over your own individual accounts. He is free to spend his personal money on his family, and you can spend yours as you see fit. So he needs to determine how much he can send back home based on how much extra personal spending cash he wants to have. But household account comes first. You don\u2019t have to spend your personal money on his fam and he doesn\u2019t get to give you grief on how you spend your personal money. Just know that he will feel like there is an imbalance bc he will most likely have less personal money to spend on himself than you have. But again, that\u2019s his choice - give his personal money to the fam back home and deal with less money for himself. But it doesn\u2019t impact your household.", "He can do whatever he wants with his spare money after all your share household expenses are paid. You can\u2019t ask him not to send his own money.

If he does then he wants to mooch off you and you should run away. \n\nNTA", "NAH - It helps to think of an engagement as your last chance before marriage to figure out whether you're fundamentally compatible. When you find a conflict in something huge, like money or children, you have to lean into that issue to figure out if it's a dealbreaker before you're legally tied to another person. This is doubly so if you'd need to sponsor someone's visa to proceed with the marriage. You mentioned anxiety about sharing a bank account in the comments; your gut is telling you to pay attention!", "I mean, what if your parents couldn\u2019t afford their medical bills?
