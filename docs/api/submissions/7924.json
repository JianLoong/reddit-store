My wife (22F) comes from this big super conservative family of like 6 kids. Her parents are abusive religious nuts who disowned her after she got an abortion some years back because neither  of us wants kids.\n\nLast year her little brother  \"Madden\" ( just turned 16M) wrapped his parents car around a tree drunk driving after his parents threw him out after some abusive a*hole teammate he was dating on his baseball team outed him. Apparently he'd been coping with his parents and the boyfriend with alot of alcohol for a while now. Now look I feel for him , he's a good kid ,butttt I don't want the responsibility of taking care of a baby much less a teenager.\n\nMy wife of course feels guilty for leaving her younger siblings behind in that house and basically let him come stay with us over the summer. I originally thought it was going to be temporary and he'd go back home or to a nearby relative. That was until  wife decided to just straight up take him in and he got enrolled in the school near us  and I didn't want to be the d***ck that put him out and said no. \n\nSo now all of sudden I had  to get rid of all my alcohol in our house and I'm taking this kid to school and therapy sessions and helping with homework. Sh**t I never wanted to do and I thought she didn't either.  We were supposed to finally be alone together just us able to just take off at a moments notice and do whatever we wanted with no ankle biters around.\n\nEven though ive never explicitly said anything I'm pretty sure my wife has picked up on the fact that I don't particularly want Madden around.  She confronted me after Madden went to bed Monday and told me that Madden had expressed to her that he thought I didn't like him and was upset that I don't engage with him more and open up to him. I countered that I never actually agreed for Madden to stay with us and that just because she felt guilty that we dint have to take him in. I suggested that maybe he could go live with another relative. How we didn't want kids.  She got upset and called me a heartless selfish  a**hole  saying that she's his big sister and she's supposed to be there for him and I wouldn't understand as an only child. She's been giving me the silent treatment since then.

She just decided to do it without talking to you, which indeed was an asshole move- but you\u2019ve \u2018never explicitly said anything\u2019 in response for what sounds to have been several months\u2026 all the while this troubled kid is stuck in the middle having to say something because you two are apparently incapable of communicating with each other.", "Its hard to say. As someone with siblings, I would also want to help him. That being said, I understand your pov & I would be upset as well if I didn't agree to have him live with us. Im gonna go with NAH. One of you is going to have to make a sacrifice. He stays & you're unhappy or he leaves & she's unhappy. Either way, someone's not going to like it & this might end up ruining your relationship. Good luck!", "I\u2019m going to say NAH\n\nI 100% get where you are coming from, but I don\u2019t think your GF is an AH. It is just a shitty situation\n\nAll you can do is tell your GF how you feel, and you both need to realize it is probably the end of your relationship. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s willing to even consider alternatives, you have no interest in raising a 16 year old - and even if you gave her an ultimatum and she chose you, she\u2019d likely resent you for it anyways", "NAH, with a *very minor* edit to remind you that the environment this child is getting *out* of isn't just uncomfortable or unideal, but outright unsafe.\n\nYour wife acknowledges herself that she knows you wouldn't understand that she feels she *needs* to step up and support her brother, so she absolutely should have tried harder to communicate her intentions more clearly. But you had all year to clarify with her how long he'd be staying, and you didn't. Neither of you communicated well about this situation from the start so of course it was bound to reach a point one of you wasn't anticipating; that doesn't really put either of you any more in the wrong than the other, though.\n\nTry to bear in mind that this is a 16 year old. He's underage, sure, but he's not a \"child\". He doesn't need your constant supervision, and he doesn't have to impede a childfree lifestyle. You need to communicate with your wife about your boundaries and expectations, though, or you're just going to end to resenting them both.", "No one is the ass here. I mean, your wife should have absolutely talked to you about it in the first place so that's an ass move. I have to assume she did it because she knew you'd say no and she clearly can't bring herself to push him out tough. Your feelings for not wanting him around are very valid. You went in this marriage expecting to not have those responsibilities. You guy gotta communicate and works through this. This is something that could ruin a marriage.", "I have to say I am torn on this one.  On one hand, you are both awfully young to now be responsible for a teenager with a drinking problem.  On the other hand, it is your wife's brother, who she obviously loves, and feels a sense of responsibility for.    \n\n\nI don't think you are TAH for having those feelings.  You thought you were \"free\".  Unfortunately, married life comes with some responsibilities that don't always go with your plans.  I say look at it this way.  You probably only have another year the boy will be living with you.  When he turns 18 he will likely be on his own.  You guys can then get back to being the wild 20 somethings you are.  :)   \n\n\nYou ARE a good man for taking him in and helping.  You can be a GREAT MAN by understanding that this is equally hard on your wife, and working through this all together.", "ESH. Your wife because she didn't even run it through you. You because you know your wife loves that kid. That being said, I think your wife is more of the AH here since it's both your house and she didn't even consult you. I know the feeling of not wanting to look after kids. I think you both should compromise and find other options.", "NAH. Your wife unilaterally made the decision to take her brother into your shared home. There was no discussion, and it has completely upended the life you were living. On the other hand, it sounds like her brother needs her right now, as much of a mess as he is. My uncle was in a similar situation some years back. He thought he and his wife were going to have the freedom of retirement when tragedy struck and they had to take in two (of her) grandnieces. He didn\u2019t want to set his life back to raise two tweenage girls, and he and my aunt were briefly separated. But he decided that he\u2019d rather have his wife than a few more years of peaceful retirement, and ended up coming back. The girls are out of the house and living their own lives now, and my aunt and uncle are enjoying their retirement. So, OP, you just have to ask yourself now whether you\u2019d rather have your wife, or 2-3 years of freedom.", "NAH......but your outlook here is weird. \n\nYou make it sound like you took in an infant. You call him an ankle biter. This kid is only seven years younger than you. You aren't exactly raising him. He will be with you for less than two years before he's eighteen and can move out. If driving him to therapy is such a chore then give him an allowance for Uber or help him get a car. Send him to tutoring if you don't want to help with homework. You're choosing to focus on the inconvenience to you personally over the fact you saved a miserable suffering family member trapped in a self-destructive cycle of abuse from his bigot parents.", "I am going to have to go with NAH, at least in the main cast of characters. The parents are, obviously, and the  teammate/ex is. But you aren\u2019t, your wife isn\u2019t, and Madden isn\u2019t. That\u2019s some jacked-up shit going on in your family, and everyone is doing their best. Can you and your wife get therapy? You both didn\u2019t want kids, fair, fair. But she didn\u2019t so much change her mind as have her brother thrust upon her on a way where she felt she can give him a foundation to save his life. Can he stay 2 more years until he graduates? That\u2019s a huge ask of you. And you\u2019re not wrong to not want it. And also it\u2019s something she may feel very called to do if there are no good options for him. Therapy for all, communicate openly with each other, and try to walk this road together. Peace.", "NTA, verging on NAH, but I think your lives might end up taking different paths from here if you can\u2019t find a good solution. Your wife *wants* to take care of her brother. He is a kid in a crisis situation and he needs someone to love him through it. I will (very) softly call her TA because she really should have gotten your full agreement first since you live together and you\u2019re being expected to take on responsibilities you didn\u2019t sign on for, but I think it is clear that if you\u2019d disagreed she would have been very resentful - kind of like you are now. Is there anyone else who is more willing and equipped to help Madden? Do you want to be with your wife enough to deal with this with good grace for a few years?", "I am not going to judge here as this is a really difficult situation. I understand that you both decided not to have kids and that you don't want the responsibility. But I also understand that he is your wife's little brother and she feels the need to not let him down. She should definitely have talked to you before letting him stay. But I also understand that she is unable to just throw him out onto the street. \nWhat are his plans for the future? Will he be off to college in and/or start to work in a year? Have you talked about that? If not, this may be the first step: clearly talk about his plans and then take it from there", "NAH.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong because you both agreed to a certain life. But your wife also isn\u2019t wrong for wanting support her brother.\n\nI think you both need to communicate better, but I also think the reason doing so is so hard is because you both know what this likely means.\n\nYou\u2019re wife no longer wants the life you do - she wants to raise her traumatized teenage brother. \n\nThis is either a sacrifice you can make or it\u2019s not. But agreeing to stay means going all in. \n\nIt\u2019s okay if this is more than you can give.", "NTA\n\nYou thought you guys weren't going to be raising a kid. Taking him and doing stuff for him feels a lot like raising a kid. She really needed to at least talk about it before basically adopting him. There is probably some level of compromise here but no one is going to figure anything out without conversation. Hopefully she is just gathering thoughts and feelings right now.", "NTA.\n\nTaking in an alcoholic teenager is something that both partners need to agree to in advance. It's no small thing.", "You and your wife are both over the AH line. Your wife should have discussed this with you. But this is her brother and she is worried. The kid is caught in the middle. Time for a mediator in the form of marriage counseling. \n\nTell your BIL the truth. Dont say something to hurt him but let him know you were never asked and you are trying to adjust. But he is already 16. He'll be in college soon. This shouldn't stop you from traveling with a little planning. (Get your BIL into counseling too. ) Maybe you'll get a brother out of it.", "Yes your wife should have talked it through with you first so shes an AH there.\n\nBut... why are you so uncaring about this lad, he's having a really horrendous time right now, rather than you wanting to help a family member out instead you're complaining, he's 16 he didn't ask for or deserve having shit parents, hes lost and trying but you seem to just want to throw him to the curb and don't care what happens to him. \n\nHas he actually done anything bad to you? Because from my POV he just needs love, guidance and acceptance ... you really dislike him so much that you can't put yourself out a bit for a few years to help someone your wife loves dearly? \n\nIf you are hell bent on not having him there then you may cost your marriage. Maybe you and your wife could come to some agreement with him, for example you will support him but as soon as he can help support himself he needs to help out too, have rules and boundaries he must agree to. He is 16 you won't be doing half as much for him as you would a baby. \n\nAs for time for just you and the mrs... again he's 16 I mean he probably will want to hang with his friends more than be around you pair. \n\nHe has been treated really badly by people he should of been able to rely on... don't add to the list of people who let him down, if anything for your wife's sake. Hes important to her.\n\nSorry that was long, strong feelings on this one!!!!", "NTA, these kinds of things should def be discussed. I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt that if you were in on the discussion from the start maybe you'd be more committed to helping Madden as he's really vulnerable at the moment and your choices right now could either make or break this young man's life. Yes you never signed up for this, sometimes life throws you a curveball and we're put into situations where we can either be a hero, or not. Your choice.", "I'd say ESH. I agree your wife should have consulted with you before making huge decisions like this and that you both agreed you didn't want kids, BUT. As a gay man who grew up in a similar environment to your BIL, if he stayed in that house any longer it's highly likely it would've led him to make an attempt on his life. He's 16 so it's not like he'll be in the house forever. This is for the well being of a loved on so sucking it up for the time being would be worth it.", "ESH, except for the kid.  Your wife didn't make her intentions clear and you didn't ask for clarification.  Your perspective seems a little odd to me, seeming to prefer a situation where you would be responsible for a young person for 18+ years instead of just helping a teenager for a few.  It's not my business to tell you what to do, but your brother in law may not have any better options.  If family means anything to you consider sucking it up for a couple years or you might find yourself divorced as well.", "NTA. She unilaterally decided to take him into your shared home and now you're expected to take on a fatherly role. That would be a deal breaker for me.", "NTA. There was a lack of communication in this scenario as you tell it. I can\u2019t tell you what to do, but would suggest you sit down and have a hard rational conversation to work it out.", "Your wife is the asshole and dont let anyone tell you\notherwise.\n\nIt doesnt matter if you end up helping the kid or not, the issue is that your wife did not sit down and talk to you about this monumental decision that affects both of you, financially, emotionally, and mentally. Thats 100% an asshole move.\n\nYou now have to not only share your living space but provide for a whole other person and you werent even talked to about it. Thats not ok and now she guilt trips you about it too- thats awful.\n\nLook im a woman and Id absolutely would have done the same as your wife and taken my sibling in but I 100% would not have sprung it on my SO. We would need to talk about expectations and bounderies first and he would need to consent. If he didnt consent then we would probably divorce but either way, the conversation should have happened.", "INFO: What other housing options are reasonably available?\n\nSorry bud but that brother is a part of your wife's life, and has been for longer than you. It is one thing to not want to bring a new baby into the family, it is another to kick out your younger sibling who has been abused by the parents and his boyfriend.\n\nYou need respect that your wife is going to support her brother, and if you aren't willing support her then you should leave. If you can find a way to support Madden that better fits with your, and your wife's needs then go for it, but resenting Madden and your wife is unfair and unkind.\n\nMadden can already tell that you seem to dislike him. He has gone through enough without being made to feel guilty just because he needs a home and his parents are AHs.\n\nYTA", "Nta. The situation isn\u2019t ideal at all but both of you agreed on having no children.

Your wife made a unilateral decision in your relationship. That affects both of you greatly. Decisions like this have to be a two yes one no deal.  You need to step up and stand up for yourself.", "NTA.

I can't stress this enough but she did not choose this, life happened and she doesn't want to abandon her brother, she wants to help him not out of guilty, as you seem to think, but out of love people can feel love for their relatives you know. If it was your parents or someone from your family wouldn't you want to help them? You are been very dismissive of your wife's feelings. \nAnyhow, either you sit down and talk and reach some kind of middle ground or this could be the end of your relationship.", ">I don't want the responsibility of taking care of a baby much less a teenager.\n\nINFO: the 16 year old brother has a baby?", "NTA.\n\nYour wife is wildly inappropriate for not even consulting you over this matter. This is your home with her and whether it's her brother or someone else, she should never have taken this decision without your consent.", "NTA. She should have had a conversation with you first. I am also an only child and I often marvel at other family dynamics but ultimately it sounds like she signed you up to be in a situation you both agreed you did it want to be in.

I could never imagine trying to manger a teenager in my early twenties.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is behaving like \"a heartless selfish a\\*\\*hole\" toward you.\n\nEvery decision she's made without consulting you is an example of her choosing her family over you. It's one thing for her to choose to parentify herself by deciding to take her brother in. It's entirely different for her to put that on you with rides to school and therapy sessions and helping with homework, especially since she knows full well that you never wanted to be a parent.\n\nHer taking you for granted in this fashion is the sort of thing that ends relationships.\n\nHer argument is that she's \"supposed to be there\" for her younger brother. Does she feel less obligated to \"be there\" for you? Did the two of you make wedding vows about \"forsaking all others?\"\n\nThe fact that she hasn't even acknowledged your feelings, much less acted in a way that takes them into account, is a huge red flag.", "NTA for not wanting him there, but you both need to work on your communication.

Yes, you and your wife should have had a talk before Madden moved in and got on common ground (boundaries, rules, timelines, etc) BUT this is a teenage kid with nowhere to go who has just been kicked out of his home.

Also with his school and a part-time job, he won't always be home.

Absolutely. Family means everything to a lot of people and your hesitance to help her little brother in what is clearly a very hard time of his life his life is very, very ugly. You might think she's an asshole for trying to bring a kid into your life even though you said you never wanted any but she's just trying to help a kid that was already here and important to her survive growing up under what sound like terrible religious fanatic parents. No one is forcing you to procreate. You're shifting goal posts and insisting that it was your original intention, but I see through it.. She's not trying to have a child, she's trying to adapt to a bad situation so that a child who is already here gets a fighting chance at life. So yeah, yta for sure. And you're surprisingly selfish. I hope she leaves you because this is a pretty clear indicator that you are deeply self concerned at the least", "YTA\n\nI think it would be reasonable to expect your wife to take on parenting duties like having boundaries with him to not touch your alcohol so you don\u2019t have to take it out of the house, and making rules so that he isn\u2019t out getting into trouble, going to school, getting a job, driving responsibly if he has a car or uses yours etc. And if he were to cause trouble in your home then it would be reasonable to not allow him to stay there. Also having an expectation for her to continue being present in your relationship and not to be cutting out of your time to go out, travel, whatever else is fair too.\n\nJust not wanting him around in your home, though without at least trying to set boundaries so that he can have a place to live? Yeah that makes you selfish. \n\nAlso not having a relationship with him? He\u2019s your sisters brother, therefore your family and you should have a relationship with him regardless of the living arrangements. Not bothering makes you an asshole. \n\nTeenagers are pretty much capable of taking care of themselves anyways, and if you tried to have a relationship with him you might actually learn some things about life in general and you also might build a strong bond with, yes a child, but one who is about to be an adult and will be part of your family as long as you\u2019re married to your wife. It would also help build your relationship with your wife if you support her in what she wants to do for her family with the most pure intentions.", "Soft yta. It's only for 2 to 3 years.

My wife (22F) comes from this big super conservative family of like 6 kids. Her parents are abusive religious nuts who disowned her after she got an abortion some years back because neither  of us wants kids.\n\nLast year her little brother  \"Madden\" ( just turned 16M) wrapped his parents car around a tree drunk driving after his parents threw him out after some abusive a*hole teammate he was dating on his baseball team outed him. Apparently he'd been coping with his parents and the boyfriend with alot of alcohol for a while now. Now look I feel for him , he's a good kid ,butttt I don't want the responsibility of taking care of a baby much less a teenager.\n\nMy wife of course feels guilty for leaving her younger siblings behind in that house and basically let him come stay with us over the summer. I originally thought it was going to be temporary and he'd go back home or to a nearby relative. That was until  wife decided to just straight up take him in and he got enrolled in the school near us  and I didn't want to be the d***ck that put him out and said no. \n\nSo now all of sudden I had  to get rid of all my alcohol in our house and I'm taking this kid to school and therapy sessions and helping with homework. Sh**t I never wanted to do and I thought she didn't either.  We were supposed to finally be alone together just us able to just take off at a moments notice and do whatever we wanted with no ankle biters around.\n\nEven though ive never explicitly said anything I'm pretty sure my wife has picked up on the fact that I don't particularly want Madden around.  She confronted me after Madden went to bed Monday and told me that Madden had expressed to her that he thought I didn't like him and was upset that I don't engage with him more and open up to him. I countered that I never actually agreed for Madden to stay with us and that just because she felt guilty that we dint have to take him in. I suggested that maybe he could go live with another relative. How we didn't want kids.  She got upset and called me a heartless selfish  a**hole  saying that she's his big sister and she's supposed to be there for him and I wouldn't understand as an only child.

He is also a minor so there is likely some fun legal ramifications from insane religious parents coming your way.", "> ESH- talk to each other more\n\nYeah, I can't agree with any YTA vote. Nearly a week of the silent treatment absolutely makes her an asshole. And that's not even touching on her blindsiding OP with this.", "To be fair not agreeing with OP but this kid is A and alcoholic and B dealing with parental abuse since he was born  and dating violence since he was at least 14 or 15 maybe 13 depending on when he and yh3 teammate started dating so him being a severely traumatized teen is a bit different then having your average 16 yr old around.", "I appreciate your comment because I've been waffling between all four judgments. NAH because there isn't an ideal solution for this but you are still stepping up. YTA because this is an obvious emergency situation with someone who has substance issues AND is part of a vulnerable group without much of a support system. NTA because not only did your wife not consult you, but also doesn't seem to give two gosh darn about your feelings. ESH because of everything. \n\nI think ultimately there is nothing wrong with feeling a way. You are still doing what you need to do and that's why your wife's dismissive attitude towards your feelings grates me WAY more than her unilateral decision. However, this isn't a healthy way to live. You need to make healthy decisions fast. You cannot go on being a robot fueled by resentment.\n\nLet's get to the obvious thing: you and your wife need to communicate better. If you think you can work on it yourselves, great! But do not fear a counselor to get a neutral space. A lot needs to be addressed. What is the long term plan here? Do you have legal guardianship? Will you and your wife be the ones sending him to school/helping with employment? What is the division of parental duties? From your post it sounds like you have the lions share. If your wife knows you feel this way, is she helping or hindering? It sounds like you got deep ended with little to no regard for you and sorry. No matter the emergency, your wife cannot neglect your emotional state for someone else's. Build on what you feel comfortable with and find the medium where you can help until you are ready and able to take on more.\n\nAnd since I haven't seen this in any other comments. You and your wife are only 6 and 7 years respectively older than her brother. You are barely out of childhood yourselves and are taking on a task that would be daunting for someone far more established in life and emotionally mature. Give each other some grace and empathy.", "Their Aunt maybe could take him but she isn't totally accepting though and I want to be with her I do I just don't want all this responsibility.", "no he doesn't have a baby,  I was just saying.", "> *another 2 years he could be away in college*\n\nThis is a temporary arrangement.  Your marriage will be stronger if you step up and help this young man get his life together.\n\nYour wife needs therapy, too.  She was apparently parentified to the extent that she feels responsibility to her siblings.  It wouldn't be fair for you to end up raising all of them.\n\n**I hope that the abusive parents are paying you child support**.  If not perhaps you should see an attorney about guardianship and any other custody issues.\n\nsoft YTA", "All the more reason for a sibling to offer a calm, supportive neutral environment to call home while he seeks the tools to deal with his trauma.", "Sending an already-traumatized LGBTQ+ kid with active substance use issues to live with a relative who \u201cisn\u2019t totally accepting\u201d doesn\u2019t sound like a better or safer alternative to him living with you and your wife.   \n\nPlease try to hang in there, work on communication with your wife, and get some family therapy for the 3 of you together (and individual therapy, too, if you can afford it for each of you).  I know this isn\u2019t what you wanted for your married life, but figuring how to get through it\u2014together, as a team\u2014will make your marriage stronger and help prepare you (individually and as a couple) for handling other unexpected stressors in the future.", "I'm pretty sure that your 16-year-old BIL doesn't want to have parents who kicked him out because he's gay, or to have been abused by his ex-bf, or to have developed a problem with alcohol as a result of both. Also, he's 16, not 6 or 6 months, so it's not like you're looking down the barrel of many years of intensive, heavy-duty parenting. \n\nTry to imagine yourself in his shoes; what would you want, if you were he? (Tip: Start with the assumption that the answer is *not* \"a BIL who clearly resents me for being here and is so desperate to get me out of the way that he'd happily ship me off to live with an aunt who would be, at best, marginally less hostile to me than my parents are.\") \n\nI really hope you will try to rise to the occasion. This isn't what you planned or wanted for your life right now, and that is unfortunate, but *it is temporary.* Furthermore, I strongly suspect that, if you can find it within yourself to be the source of steadfast support and love that both your wife and your BIL need right now, you will ultimately not only not regret it, but in fact be glad and grateful that you did it. \n\nRemember your wedding vows; did they say anything about \"for better, for worse\"? Life doesn't bring only better after better after better, improvement upon improvement, world without end. This is one of the hard times, but life will bring you more of them; if you don't bail at the first hurdle, you'll have a chance at building the kind of marriage that can withstand whatever difficulties life may throw at you. \n\nAlso, your wife absolutely should have discussed this with you before she brought her brother home, but you also should have discussed it with her. Neither of you has handled this appropriately. Rather than focusing on who has wronged whom, try to set your ego, frustration, hurt feelings, and anger aside, and focus on working together to handle the situation that is before you.\n\nAnd again, remember, he's 16. It's not going to be long before he's ready and eager to go out into the world and build his own adult life.

The way you keep making comments about your literal brother in law, is pretty disgusting in and of itself. It isn't just some random kid from a group home, or your child. I'd be mortified if you had kids with how much vitriol you've spit towards even your own BROTHER IN LAW. You said you didn't want the responsibility then don't help her or him. It's your right. Just don't be surprised when the divorce comes, cause she's clearly going to pick her sibling over you.", "ESH - Wife had no right to take him in without talking to you first.
