And I challenge even the most sex positive person on the planet to want to hear their mom fuck. What they\u2019re doing is deviant, and they\u2019re getting something out of this behavior.

Maybe a teacher. This is abuse, op, even a crime in some countries.", "NTA- it\u2019s incredibly inappropriate and maybe even illegal to have sex in the same room your child is in. That\u2019s so wrong. They need to do that when you aren\u2019t around.", "NTA, and you should never, EVER be put in a position where you have to share a room with your mother and her boyfriend while they\u2019re having sex. \n\nIs there another room in the house or apartment you could use as your sleeping quarters?", "NTA\n\nI don't care what religion/culture someone is from, having sex in the same room as your child is disgusting. Especially when said child knows exactly what you're doing. Absolutely appalling behavior on their part.", "NTA and could be constituted as an illegal act on their part", "NTA. I don\u2019t know where you live, but where I\u2019m from that\u2019s illegal and they could go to jail.", "NTA. You\u2019re sharing a bedroom?

This isn\u2019t a bunch of college kids in a dorm this is your freaking mother.", "NTA it's actually child abuse to force your underage children to listen to you have sex in the same room.", "Nope, what your mother is doing is awful.\n\nYou need to have a discussion with your mother explaining that you find it VERY uncomfortable to hear them having sex constantly, and it makes it hard for you to get some sleep.\n\nIn the meantime, you need to start doing whatever you have to to move out as soon as you are able to.\n\nNTA", "NTA - that's illegal where I live.", "NTA\n\nUgh, that's disgusting.", "NTA pretty sure you are describing sexual abuse", "NTA at all.\n\nI don't know how old you are but I'm quite shocked.\n\nI know that it's probably not that easy but I would try to sleep in another room, and to speak with your mother or someone that could help you with this situation.", "NTA.\n\nSo they are having sex while they are in the same room as you?? That\u2019s disgusting.", "NTA, you're a minor - a child - and they're doing that knowing you're awake? That's disgusting, that's child abuse, wtf is wrong with them?  \nThey either need to plan their sexual activities for when you're not here or fricking keep it in their pants for God's sake!", "NTA. I'd talk to them the once to get it out in the open and if it continued I'd take to screaming non-stop every night until it became impossible to ignore. Your mother is disgusting. I'd probably cough up blood before I could get myself to stop screaming.", "I am from a third world country where many families share one space. Believe me when I say , it is INAPPROPRIATE even where it is legal. The parents are sick people.Shitty is shitty no matter the flag.NTA, you better off sleeping with your sibling outside.", "NTA   \n\n\nMy parents split when I was 4 and when my mom got a new boyfriend, I heard them ... I was 7, and it scarred me for life.", "NTA Also I can't think of any countries where it's normal to have sex in the same room as your kid.

It's usually better to talk to people about things before getting that pissed off. Having said that, geez that's rough! I don't blame you for yelling.", "NTA- It's hard to mask the sounds of sex, so even if they kept it down its probably still audible. Have you tried listening to white noise in some headphones or calming sounds. If they can keep it down then all you need to do is block out the lower sounds with something that'll help induce sleep.", "Idk, there's some pretty obvious cultural differences at play here, but I can say NTA from an American perspective. Is it common where you live for parents to have sex in a room where their kids are asleep? It's definitely not ok in the U.S. but different countries have different rules.", "NTA, but totally ineffective. \nWhen you say you share one room, do you mean one bedroom, or that your entire living space is one room?\nIf you just share a bedroom, it's time for you to start sleeping on the couch so the bedroom door can be closed, and you can get some sleep. Otherwise, there's not much you can do about your mom's insensitiveness. Acting like nothing happened isn't going to change a thing, as yelling didn't either. Maybe you can ask your mom to get her sexual needs met while you aren't there, perhaps while you are at school, or maybe you can go to a friend's house whenever your mom is feeling frisky. The point here is for your mom to recognize and respect that you are uncomfortable hearing her sexual activities. She can plan her activities in advance at a time that doesn't interfere with your sleep, and communicate this with you, so you can be elsewhere. If she is so selfish that she is unwilling to do this, look into living with your dad, other relatives, or family friends.
