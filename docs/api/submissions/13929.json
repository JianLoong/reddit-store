Otherwise, there's not much you can do about your mom's insensitiveness. Acting like nothing happened isn't going to change a thing, as yelling didn't either. Maybe you can ask your mom to get her sexual needs met while you aren't there, perhaps while you are at school, or maybe you can go to a friend's house whenever your mom is feeling frisky. The point here is for your mom to recognize and respect that you are uncomfortable hearing her sexual activities. She can plan her activities in advance at a time that doesn't interfere with your sleep, and communicate this with you, so you can be elsewhere. If she is so selfish that she is unwilling to do this, look into living with your dad, other relatives, or family friends.
