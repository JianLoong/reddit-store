Otherwise, there's not much you can do about your mom's insensitiveness. Acting like nothing happened isn't going to change a thing, as yelling didn't either. Maybe you can ask your mom to get her sexual needs met while you aren't there, perhaps while you are at school, or maybe you can go to a friend's house whenever your mom is feeling frisky. The point here is for your mom to recognize and respect that you are uncomfortable hearing her sexual activities. She can plan her activities in advance at a time that doesn't interfere with your sleep, and communicate this with you, so you can be elsewhere. If she is so selfish that she is unwilling to do this, look into living with your dad, other relatives, or family friends.

So fucked up that it's semi-common.\n\nI don't care how you would have responded to this. You must be so sick and tired of hearing them so much and it is so understandable to yell at them in anger or in hopes of them shutting up. Life as a teenager can suck so bad with school and society's expectations for you and having this mental trauma added to it must be overwhelming.

It IS abuse to subject teenagers to sex noises. It's wholly inappropriate. You live in that close quarters, you need to be having sex when the minor is at school. Drop them off to go see a movie. Do it when they are having a sleepover at a friend's. etc.\n\nI lived in my ex's living room essentially with his parents on the other side of the wall from where our bed was. Not once did we hear them having sex and not once did they hear us because we were either quiet as mice in the middle of the night or did it when they weren't home.

NTA.\n\nWhy in the hell would you have sex in the SAME ROOM as your kid? That is not only gross, but i'm willing to bet anything that it's illegal as well (and also fucking gross).\n\nOne of the questions i have is what is stopping them from booking a hotel or some other place to screw in, or perhaps waiting until you've left for school at the very least?", "NTA.

I grew up in a house where my parents had loud, sometimes violent sounding sex all the time. The vents in the house were connected and my room was right below theirs. My dad would also grope my mom right in front of us and they had sex in hotel rooms with us there when we traveled. It was awful. I'm 44 and I still can't spend the night at their house without reliving all of it.  I also freak out when my husband and I make any noise while having sex because my daughters room is right across the hallway. I'm just starting to dive into this in therapy, hopefully I can start to work through it.", "That's disturbing AF and no... NTA.

This is child abuse.", "That\u2019s gross. NTA. Your mother should grow up and keep the private stuff to herself. That\u2019s abuse. 14 shouldn\u2019t be exposed to that stuff.

Any chance you could sleep on a couch or air mattress in another room? :(", "NTA. I had a narcissist mother who would fuck with her boyfriend EVERY MORNING and some nights when I was like fresh out of highschool and I was in the room right next door. Didn\u2019t even try to be quiet. You have the right to say something they should not be subjecting you to that. ESPECIALLY IF ITS AFFECTING YOUR SLEEP!

She needs to take that business elsewhere!", "I say definitely NTA, and it\u2019s more like some form of sexual abuse of a minor.

Having to deal with parental figures who are just sexual deviants, on top of battling insomnia, is going to take a toll on your health. Idk where you live, but hopefully there is some law that allows you to emancipate yourself and live with someone who can give you a stable home. Good luck.", "Yeah no, who wants to be around another couple having sex while they are trying to sleep in general let alone their own mother.\n\nIt\u2019s especially bad as they know you are awake", "NTA: you could handle this in probably the most aggressive manner possible and no one would blame you because absolutely NOONE wants to hear their mom getting boinked", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nI have heard my parents doing the deed once. Only once. All I really heard was the bed banging against the wall. I was a 23 year old woman, it was four years ago, and I still have not recovered. Oh, and I yelled at them too. \n\nI cannot believe that your mother is consistently exposing you to this. That is beyond disgusting. You are a child - a very articulate, competent child, by the sound of it, but still, a child. You shouldn\u2019t have to endure that. Heck, not even an adult should have to endure hearing their mother have sex. It\u2019s just\u2026no. \n\nQuestion, although it doesn\u2019t change my answer: when you yelled at them, did they stop? Because if they kept going\u2026yikes. \n\nUnfortunately, this is a bigger deal that you\u2019re making it out to be, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve become so acclimatised to it. If you can, I\u2019d recommend talking to an adult you trust. If your dad is in the picture, then maybe him. If not, maybe a grandparent, friends mother, teacher you trust etc. \n\nIf none of these options are available, your mother is your best living solution and you want to talk to her about this, I would suggest going to her with some solutions. You\u2019ll know what your family can reasonably afford; maybe you could discuss some noise cancelling headphones for you. \n\nBottom line: you shouldn\u2019t have to hear this. You shouldn\u2019t have to lock yourself in the bathroom (when you should be tucked up in bed) to get away from it. You absolutely have every right to yell at them and tell them it\u2019s disgusting.

I was merely trying to give the OP some things she could do in light of her mother's irresponsibility, some ways for her to take care of herself. Secondly, families all sleeping in the same room at night, and children knowing that their parents were engaging in sexual activity, has been the norm for a very long time. And the OP stated that it is the norm where she lives. It has only been in the last 100+ years that parents and children slept not only in separate rooms, but behind closed doors.

In rural areas the euphemism \"roll in the hay\" alluded to barns being a place to find privacy when the main house might only have a single bed.\n\nJust getting on with it in the same room as your teenage daughter hasn't been socially acceptable in pretty much any time period.", "Growing as a species implies evolution. We haven't grown as a species. We've just gained a lot of wealth because of which a new culture is created. Some of it may be detrimental to or biology. For example a daily shower or twice daily shower is probably doing more harm than good to our sounds depending on the temperature of water and the soaps used. I'm sympathetic to OP and God knows I don't want to be a witness to this. But I do think it is important to acknowledge the huge amount of privilege that is supporting this culture.
