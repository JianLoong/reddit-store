Who\u2019re you to judge that? Just say you\u2019re not in a place financially to contribute, end of story. But you turned it into something else by adding in your judgement. I don\u2019t know her and I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s difficult from your description but being judgmental puts you down at her level.", "If you can't afford it, you can't afford it. I don't know why you also need to be going off about her vanity also. Skin surgery is usually pretty necessary after gastric bypass, not just a vanity thing but a mobility and comfort thing. But that doesn't mean that you can afford it.\n\nNAH", "NTA, you can't afford what you can't afford.  FYI, depending on where your mother-in-law lives, the surgery may be covered by insurance if certain conditions are met. (Such as infections under the skin flap, mobility,  or interfering with ADLs)", "NTA NTA NTA. Cut and dry. Black and white. You even went so far as to explain that \"Due to the economy we aren't in a place to help contribute\" implying to me at least that if you were rolling in cash you might even help out. Kudos to you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't waste another minute feeling guilty about this.", "NTA. They could\u2019ve used that camper money for surgery, if they\u2019re not willing to scrimp and save why should you?", "jetting a boob job for no medical reason is vanity .... getting excess skin removed after weight loss is not vanity imo it will help with mental health also carry around excess skin is probably quite heavy since she doesnt have the fat/muscle to support it .... but if you cant afford it you cant afford it", "NTA \n\nBut have to say this. My mom had her stomach tied for medical reasons. She lost over 340 pounds. \n\nWe all the family helped chip in to get excess skin removed. \nOne because it left over 20lbs loose skin. Which ended up causing sores and wounds.\nTwo because it'd not vanity when the skin goes everywhere and cloths either don't fit, hurt, or you look like a monster.\n\nSo I guess my thing is please don't call it vanity when you haven't lived with that or felt the way many feel. Not saying MIL is but I just ask for respect for those who do get it removed even if it's to feel better but sure shouldn't expect people to pay for it", "So NTA for not contributing. Whether you can afford it or not, it\u2019s not your job, and if you can\u2019t afford it, then you can\u2019t afford it. That being said, YTA for the judgement on calling it a vanity project. That was just really unnecessary, and generally not true following bypass. There are many reasons to have this done, and even if it purely is to make the person feel better in his/her/their own skin, there is nothing wrong with that.", "NTA - it\u2019s your money. Nobody gets to tell you how to spend it but you.", "NTA.\n\nIf she can afford a new pickup and camper, they're in a better financial situation to pay for this elective procedure than you are.", "I say nta for not contributing. But I also had bypass surgery, lost 200 lbs and my loose skin causes infections bleeding and a lot of pain. Insurance will not pay for mine. I only wanted to say that for me, this surgery would not be vanity. I don't know why I got stuck on that. Your mils shenanigans are ridiculous and you should NOT participate but this surgery is NOT always just vanity.", "NTA. Easy fix. MIL can sell the new camper and truck. Not something I'd lose sleep over.", "NTA\n\nYou cannot afford to help right now. It would be nice if you could but you cannot.", "NTA.  They can sell the new camper or pickup to pay for it.", "YTA for saying not supporting her vanity.\n\nI have known people who have struggled with weight lost for years and finally they succeed but unfortunately get left with a lot of excess skin which effects they mental health greatly when they won the battle with weight loss. \n\nIf you don't want to help don't help don't be mean about it.", "This seems like a huge 2-sides-to-the-story thing. From your POV, definitely NTA but it feels like there\u2019s more to it .", "You clearly have some other issues with your MIL, which you haven't mentioned in your post as excess skin removal surgery isn't a \"vanity project\".\n\nYTA for calling it a vanity project as large folds of excess skin can be prone to nasty infections as well negatively affecting a persons mental health.", "NTA because you can't afford it but YTA for the vanity comment. Everyone who has had bypass or similar procedure will lose a lot of weight and need skin surgery. It's not about vanity", "NTA\n\nPerhaps if they didn't have disposable income they have recently been spending on non-essentials AND you were easily able to afford it, you could perhaps decide to help a little.\n\nBut given that neither of these are the case, YWNBTA for saying no.", "NTA - \"NO\" is a complete sentence.", "You\u2019re not the asshole for being unable to donate, but your definitely one for complaining that it\u2019s vanity.", "NTA about paying for it.\n\nThis is a very common surgery after significant weight loss.  It takes TIME & and health care provider that is good at documenting, for this to be covered by insurance.\n\nMIL doesn't want to wait and/or put in the effort to do this on her own. Which is also understandable.  As a person who lost well over 100lbs, it is so not just a vanity issue. It is extremely difficult to prevent skin issues, and \\*when there is an issue, it takes so fucking long to get it under control. It affects daily care, intimacy (gets smelly even if you clean multiple times a day, which is also not ideal), etc.  If one lives in a humid environment, it is so much worse and difficult to maintain skin care. It can go from rash to skin ulcer very quickly.\n\nYou are TA for dismissing it as a just a vanity thing.", "NTA OP, Your MIL's elective skin surgery is not as important as your ability and need to safely support  your family.   She needs to address her own ability to obtain her \"wants\". Your \"needs\" supercede her \"wants\" every time! If MIL can't understand this, she is quite selfish!", "Why couldn\u2019t her son communicate that you\u2019ll can\u2019t afford to help out? Why do you have to get in the middle? Just that fact makes me feel you basically wanted to tell her off for what you consider a vanity project. YTA for that.\n\nParents can ask for money. Children can say no. It\u2019s simple as that. There\u2019s no need to judge", "NTA. spot on about the vanity point.", "NTA", "NTA.", "Excess skin removal isn't medically necessarily. They can sell the rv if they need money.

Yeah the camper I would say is a bit much.\n\nBy the way this sort of surgery is not just for cosmetic reasons, the excess skin can get in the way and can cause problems for people Beyond just a confidence issue. I think she should definitely have the surgery if she has managed to keep the weight off for a significant period of time.\n\nIf she's really sincere about this, even if you have a little money, it doesn't take much to go on your local swap list and find some free empty baskets so that she has them so other people can start making baskets for a fundraiser for her.

It just implies a personal bias and a lack of insight.", "Depends on the insurance. A friend of mine lost over 100 lbs and was left with loose folds of skin that was getting irritated abd she even had a few infections. Her Dr told her that she should have the skin removed for medical reasons but the insurance company refused to cover it. This was being done because of the irritation and infections, NOT because of vanity but it still wasn't covered. For me I'd say ESH. If you can't afford it then you shouldn't be pressured to spend money you don't have, but telling her that's its making you sick and uneasy to support what you perceive as her vanity was a low blow and makes you an asshole, too."]}
