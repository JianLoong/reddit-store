My son has passed out a good few times before, so we've made sure he knows what to do when he starts to feel faint to make sure he doesn't hurt himself. However, when I arrived at the school my son was holding an ice pack to his head, when I asked about it the nurse told me he had hit his head when he fell, I wondered why he hadn't lay down like we taught him to do, I brushed it off and decided to ask him about it later as he was still kind of out of it. The next day I asked him about it and what he told me made my blood boil. Apparently when my son had first started to feel like he was going to pass out he tried to tell his teacher. When he stood up to talk to her he was immediately yelled at to sit back down. The next time he tried to tell her she told him that he didn't look sick so he wasn't allowed to go to the nurses office. Then,his class was doing an activity that required standing for practically the rest of the lesson, before the activity started my son, yet again told this teacher that he felt like he was going to pass out and asked if he could sit the activity out. The teacher responded by yelling at him, claiming he was just being lazy and was making excuses. My son's friend was getting worried about him so he told the teacher, who then started yelling at his friend, accusing them both of trying to get out of lesson. Not even a minute later my son passed out, and according to his friend and a couple other classmates, she acted very shocked, as if she hadn't been ignoring him trying to tell her how he felt for the last 5 minutes. I'm extremely worried about the impact this will have on my son, as when the fainting first started he didn't tell any of his teachers as he was scared that they were going to yell at him, this resulted in quite a few injuries from falling. It has taken a while for him to start telling them when he's feeling faint and I'm afraid this incident will cause him to stop asking and he will hurt himself.\n\nI had wanted to go down to the school that day but my son had stayed off and my wife wasn't home from work yet. The following Monday I arranged an appointment with the Principal. After I explained what had happened, he called in my son's teacher, who then tried to deny the fact that he ever told her anything and he had just randomly collapsed. This is where I may be TA. By this point I was pissed, I began to scream at her, yelling about how my son could have gotten hurt. I was so pissed I hadn't even noticed that she'd started to cry. By that point I was asked to leave by the principal. \n\n\nMy wife and some of my friends think I'm in the right, but my parents and the other half of my friends think I went too far. I don't know about this one \n\nWhat do you guys think, AITA?", "created_utc": 1689009610, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w06da/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sons_teacher_and_making/", "score": 3445, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At this point I think I would take my concerns to the Board of Education and let them know that you intend to speak with an attorney. Yelling at the teacher was probably not your best move, but I certainly understand when it comes to the safety of our children. It\u2019s hard to maintain our cool sometimes. I\u2019m going to say NTA.", "Did you inform the school that your son was prone fainting and have a protocol in place? What is the underlying medical condition that causes the fainting spells?", "NTA. The teacher repeatedly yelled at your son, berated him, caused him to injure himself physically and quite possibly scared him away from communicating his needs in the future. She is a bully. When confronted, she started lying to cover up her behavior, and eventually crying. Boohoo. That's what bullies do: bully, lie, then cry when not let off the hook. You losing your cool is completely understandable. Your parents don't need to have an opinion about it, and your wife is in your corner. Consult a lawyer. I bet the principal won't ask a lawyer to leave.", "NTA, she shouldn't have ignored your son. Especially because there was a protocol in place. It's a bad thing she lied.\n\nBut I do think that screaming is never the solution. You can also be angry and make a point without being verbally agressive. You also don't know how the ambiance was in the classroom, maybe the kids were teasing her and she thought that your son was joking around (it's not an excuse, I'm just trying to think of why the teacher would act like this).", "NTA - The teacher blatantly ignored what your son was trying to tell her and it backfired. She of course was going to try to save herself with the principal. Thank goodness your son wasnt hurt more.", "Nta she likes yelling at kids but can't handle being yelled at seems hypocritical", "NTA. Well, you didn't need to lose your temper, but you're only human. She didn't act human when she neglected his needs. He asked to go to the nurse, ffs.", "Info - Does the school know about this condition?", "NTA", "NTA, that teacher is a bully who deserved getting called out.

The teacher is the AH", "NTA", "NTA, your teacher ignored him several times and as a result he passed out and injured himself, she shouldn\u2019t be a teacher anymore, she endangered his life.", "NTA. She has no business teaching children.", "NTA I think she needed that dose of reality for her negligence and dishonesty. She literally endangered your child's life b/c he didn't \"look sick.\" I don't remember those school floors being very soft, if he hits his head the right way it can cause life-long complications. With that in mind, it might not hurt to have your son looked over even if he says he feels fine.  He was just taught not to talk about feeling unwell, so he might try to hide it if he's not feeling 100%.", "NTA but do as much as you can to either smooth things over with the teacher or get him changed to a different class.\n\nThis will affect your son more than it will you.\n\nI hope you get a diagnosis soon.

Yelling and berating a child as an adult that has power over them is never ok that on it\u2019s own warrants going down to the school and talking to the teacher. Also as someone who still has troubles advocating for their own rights I would maybe  get a therapist for your child to help them learn to advocate for themselves while of course still letting them know that you will always advocate for them. I don\u2019t even like kids and I would have gone down there and screamed at the principal and the teacher for a random stranger.

I\u2019m sure you have something in place for the school (in the US we call it a 504) for the teachers and staff to know how to handle medical situations for your child. Which means you have sat down with the school (his teacher most likely included) and they are aware he will pass out and they know what safety plans have been put in place. Now I\u2019m going out on a limb here but you said your son has a history of of not telling and passing out. I also know that there is always a he said she said and the truth is somewhere in the middle. So I\u2019m going to say a slight YTA and only for one reason.

Go through a sequence of events that happened that day and how they go against the plan for your son. Ask why the plan was not followed. If you don't have a 504, at this point, demand one. If you do have one, refer to the pages of the plan and what was supposed to happen.

If the teacher was aware of the ongoing passing out issue and still refused to allow your son to lay down, then you\u2019re NTA.  If the school admin, nurse, and teacher were unaware of this issue because you failed to inform them, then YTA.", ">She also bullied his friend. My cousin , another student and I were yelled at by a teacher in grade 5- he made us go in an empty room, stand against the wall and yelled in our faces. I'm now 56, and I never forgot.", "Yes, the school is aware of his episodes", "The doctors believe it is most likely POTS", "Yes the school has been informed", "Lmao, WHAT?", "Has he been tested for POTS? It can cause fainting and there has been an uptick in cases as a result of COVID. (POTS can be caused by many things, one of which is viral infections, which was known even prior to COVID but it was more rare then.) I'm sure you are all on top of it, I just wanted to mention it because it took years for me to get diagnosed and sometimes it truly makes me feel awful.", "This isn't an IEP - the kid doesn't require modifications or related services, the kid needs a 504.", "Absolutely not. But OP and all of the teacher's current and future students would have been better off if he would have been able to explain what happened clearly and why it was absolutely unacceptable and dangerous instead of losing it and screaming, The end of the meeting was the principal asking OP to leave because of his blowup instead of any resolution that would help keep kids safe. His loss of control took him from the driver's seat to the \"needs escorted out\" seat.", "Ugh. It sounds like you may need to get a 504/IEP plan put in place (if you\u2019re in the US). In that case it\u2019s a legal obligation, and your son could pretty much walk out of the room to the nurse if he needed to, and have it to back him up. They legally can\u2019t disagree with it.", "Significant detail. I recommend consulting an attorney.", "Agreed. I'd go with YTA based on what he said, and had determined that long before he had said \"this is where I might be the a******.\"\n\nTo jump right to his kid's story without even asking the teacher first, and going directly to the principal is awful. Kids make stuff up all the time when they think they may have made a bad choice. I also do not believe for an instant that the teacher yelled at the kid over and over. That right there tells me he took his kid's side without even considering another point of view.\n\nI will also say that the principal was wrong to.have taken that meeting without first having the OP meet/talk directly with the teacher first.", "My relative has it. Some stuff that may help is wearing compression socks or leggings, drinking a ton of water ( way more than you'd think is a lot) and having a lot of salt. Way more than would normally be considered ok. Good luck \ud83e\udd1e", "If you are training teachers it absolutely would. Once again. This whole thing is weird. kid has this serious condition that teachers are trained on but has no diagnosis or 504. Also I don't know any school that doesn't want someone at risk of fainting to not have a 504.", "Lmao, chronically ill patients go years without proper diagnoses *on average.* Not rarely, it's the norm. They can do absolutely everything right with their personal care, primary care, and specialists for years and still have an \"idk\" at the end of it. What matters is that people's symptoms are treated correctly in the meantime, and the teacher has failed in her responsibilities to this child.", "As an adult who was a teen with a fainting disorder, it sadly isn\u2019t that easy. Years of weekly doctors appointments, countless tests, etc, finally got diagnosed with POTS two years ago after 20 years of trying to find out what\u2019s wrong with me.\n\nI feel so badly for this kid.", "Doctors say that POTS is looking like the most likely option", "My mom was a cry bully. Always saw herself as the victim. She was emotionally broken by my dad tho, who was a real piece of work.", "I cry at everything and I have very little control over it. I run out of patience with people who think I'm being manipulative. It's just water.", "*they\u2019re. \nHow ironic you\u2019re sharing a story about an awful teacher, with this spelling \ud83d\ude06", "Nah, the student needs a 504.", "Agree. IEP is for learning disabilities. 504 is for medical. \n\nOP, have your pediatrician (or whatever doc is following your child for this particular health issue) to detail what accommodations need to be made in writing. Add that to your request for a 504 meeting in writing to your principal. Keep copies of these documents and have some sort of receipt stating what day they were received. They have 30 or 60 days (can't remember which tonight) to set up the initial 504 meeting. - Former teacher", "And teachers make stuff up all the time too.  I had similar shit like this happen when I was younger.", "That\u2019s not true. Any medical documentation is legally enforceable. I actually lived this so I can attest. Allergies without anaphylaxis don\u2019t usually get 504s and you still have to make sure you don\u2019t give kids an allergen.", "A 504 has federal legal benchmarks that usually require specific and regular accommodations. So sometimes yes there is just a doctors note with the nurse and it is shared with the teacher. That is how we did it every year. Just because the teacher has to know something doesn\u2019t mean it has to be a 504 or thar OP failed by not having a 504.", "I mean, someone allowing your head to bounce off the tile isn't 'perfectly safe' in the slightest. This response is just dumb from top to bottom.", "This kind of ignorance is why people with chronic illnesses struggle to get people to believe us. I have chronic migraine which is a serious and incurable neurological condition, it took years to get a diagnosis. This teenager may have POTS, which also takes a long time to diagnose. \n\nPeople didn\u2019t believe me when I was a teenager either.", "You don\u2019t think yelling at the kid and forcing them to stand until they pass out and hit their head is abuse??", "I wish you all well!", "This is a good point. It took me many years to be diagnosed with my chronic condition. I really had to advocate for myself and be a little annoying. That\u2019s why I\u2019m encouraging OP to really dig at their son\u2019s physicians and find out what\u2019s going on.", "I'm so glad to hear that his doctors are aware of it! It can be an incredibly difficult illness to deal with and it is terrible when no one can figure out what it is. Sending best wishes to your son!\n\nIf it is POTS, there's an organization called Dysautonomia International that provides great information. They have a website and a Facebook page. You can also usually find a local support group Facebook pages if you search for \"POTS + Your City\", I've found it helpful to ask questions in there and hear from other people who have it. \n\nOh and by the way: NTA.", "This is what I\u2019m looking for. If they\u2019re in the US, a section 504 plan guarantees accommodations and a plan based on a student\u2019s medical condition. It\u2019s also wildly common for kids to have medical or health safety plans. The plans just outline what needs to happen to keep a kid safe and are updated regularly. It\u2019s insane that the teacher wasn\u2019t made very very very aware of a freaking issues that causes fainting.", "This is the answer I came looking for. Where is this child\u2019s medical plan?  This is poor planning on your part, and you\u2019re taking it out on the teacher who is doing her job by not letting a child repeatedly interrupt class.", "Are we siblings? Because that sounds eerily similar to my family life as well.", "Omg I didn\u2019t even notice this. It was a math teacher though. And btw my grammar is fantastic. It was a one-off mistake.", "He may not meet the requirements for one.", "How old are you? \n\nDo you think it's possible that things have changed in documentation since you were in school?\n\nEdit: Also,.allergies are different. They have a specific cause and a specific remedy (avoidance, epipen).\n\n\nOp's son has an as of yet undiagnosed fainting issue. This is where doctor's instructions and paperwork become vital.", "There are a ton of people who for some reason think that any show of anger or negative response to someone makes you an AH. It's so weird.", "I can't believe you think that's even remotely what happened...", "Thank you so much, this will be very helpful \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a", "It's worth shooting for one, especially if the student loses consciousness often enough to have a plan in place with the school.\n\n\nand, well, a 504 is legally enforcement. A doctors note on file or a \"medical plan\" on file with the school isn't legally enforceable", "Sure, but if you\u2019re a literal kid and don\u2019t realize the law then what does it matter? And if your parents don\u2019t either or don\u2019t have bandwidth to go up against the school that makes it moot too. None of us knew it was illegal until well after I graduated unfortunately.", "The benchmarks for a 504 have remained the same since IDEA was implemented in 1998. I started school in 2000. So no they have not.\n\nI was also a music teacher in the last five years so I did have to keep up with this.", "I mean I\u2019ve definitely seen crazier, but I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t believe anything that would contradict you", "I got mine and my son's within a month. I self-diagnosed, but laid out our symptoms and why I thought it was POTS. They referred us, and the clinic called me back that day.", "As a teacher I would highly recommend considering getting your son a 504. A 504 is a legal document that holds the school and teacher legally responsible for any accommodations your kid may need. It sounds like he passes out often enough that he may qualify. It can have things like \"The student will be offered a break in the nurse's office if feeling unwell\" or \"The student can have a snack to prevent the feeling of passing out.\" It would be created to his specific needs and you can put any preventive measure in place as well as a safety plan. \n\nUnfortunately, not all teachers are sympathetic to medical needs in the classroom which is why 504's exist.", "\u201cShut up or I\u2019ll give you something to really cry about.\u201d The refrain of my childhood.", "Same, friend, same.", "It is legally enforceable. I don\u2019t know why a lot of people think it isn\u2019t? I both had this plan and taught and that\u2019s just not the case.", "This guy's story is not at all believable. The principal  dismissed the dad because he was being abusive. He's the bully, not the teacher.", "You got lucky.  You need to realize that.  There are so so many people that go years before they get this diagnosis, because their doctors just will not listen to them. \n\nI was also one of the lucky ones.  Took me 6 months. Took a friend of mine 4 years.", "hey that\u2019s awesome for you! i\u2019m really glad you got the answers you were looking for for you and your son. it can be a pain in the butt to get doctors to listen to you so i\u2019m super glad you found one that would actually listen. i wish i\u2019d had the same experience but no luck, unfortunately.", "Medical plans are literally a state by state thing. Some states have them, a good chunk don't. Some limit what disabilities can have medical plans.\n\nFederal laws cover IEPs (not necessary in this case) and 504s (I could see one being granted in this case, especially since none of the accommodations would cost the district a thing)", "One of our principle\u2019s got caught having sex with a receptionist by a student who got sent to his office and subsequently fired, they are still people who are very much able to make wrong/unjust decisions", "Yep, I had this same problem. My high school had a limit of three unexcused absences and eight *excused* absences. I have several chronic conditions and reached that limit very quickly. \n\nAt first, they had the truancy officer threaten my mother. My mom, of course, flipped her lid on the school administration. Their next solution was suggesting I go to an \u201calternative learning\u201d school. My mom, once again, went ballistic. She essentially told them that physically disabled children don\u2019t deserve to be sent away and deprived of normal school activities just because the school wasn\u2019t willing to accommodate them. Naturally, the administrators backtracked and said that\u2019s not what they were implying; they just wanted to \u201cput all options out in the open.\u201d \n\nTheir final tactic to attempt to deter me from my education was requiring individual doctors notes for every single absence, despite having all the necessary documentation for my disability. After a few times of being dragged to the doctor just for a note, my doctor directly called the school himself. He told the school that coming to the doctor just for a *note* was only exacerbating my conditions and causing me to need more time off. They finally left me alone after he called them, so I can imagine he was not polite about it lol. \n\nAnd honestly, absences weren\u2019t even the only roadblock for chronically ill students. We were usually punished for lack of participation in gym class or threatened with being held back if we did not take AND pass gym class. Some teachers would single us out and do everything they could to fail us as weird retribution for missing their class. For school events/dances/parties etc., they often wouldn\u2019t sell us tickets because of \u201cpoor grades\u201d or \u201cexcessive absences.\u201d It was a constant circle of BS. Public school is a fucking nightmare."]}
