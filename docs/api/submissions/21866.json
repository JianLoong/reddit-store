My son has passed out a good few times before, so we've made sure he knows what to do when he starts to feel faint to make sure he doesn't hurt himself. However, when I arrived at the school my son was holding an ice pack to his head, when I asked about it the nurse told me he had hit his head when he fell, I wondered why he hadn't lay down like we taught him to do, I brushed it off and decided to ask him about it later as he was still kind of out of it. The next day I asked him about it and what he told me made my blood boil. Apparently when my son had first started to feel like he was going to pass out he tried to tell his teacher. When he stood up to talk to her he was immediately yelled at to sit back down. The next time he tried to tell her she told him that he didn't look sick so he wasn't allowed to go to the nurses office. Then,his class was doing an activity that required standing for practically the rest of the lesson, before the activity started my son, yet again told this teacher that he felt like he was going to pass out and asked if he could sit the activity out. The teacher responded by yelling at him, claiming he was just being lazy and was making excuses. My son's friend was getting worried about him so he told the teacher, who then started yelling at his friend, accusing them both of trying to get out of lesson. Not even a minute later my son passed out, and according to his friend and a couple other classmates, she acted very shocked, as if she hadn't been ignoring him trying to tell her how he felt for the last 5 minutes. I'm extremely worried about the impact this will have on my son, as when the fainting first started he didn't tell any of his teachers as he was scared that they were going to yell at him, this resulted in quite a few injuries from falling. It has taken a while for him to start telling them when he's feeling faint and I'm afraid this incident will cause him to stop asking and he will hurt himself.\n\nI had wanted to go down to the school that day but my son had stayed off and my wife wasn't home from work yet. The following Monday I arranged an appointment with the Principal. After I explained what had happened, he called in my son's teacher, who then tried to deny the fact that he ever told her anything and he had just randomly collapsed. This is where I may be TA. By this point I was pissed, I began to scream at her, yelling about how my son could have gotten hurt. I was so pissed I hadn't even noticed that she'd started to cry. By that point I was asked to leave by the principal. \n\n\nMy wife and some of my friends think I'm in the right, but my parents and the other half of my friends think I went too far. I don't know about this one \n\nWhat do you guys think, AITA?\n\n[Edit] I'm just gonna answer some frequently asked questions that the answers weren't included in the original post \n1) We are not in the US so a 504 plan is not in place, however we do have something similar \n2)My son is in the middle of getting a diagnosis, doctors say the most likely option is POTS \n3)My son is 13, and I would say he's a fairly well behaved kid, only sometimes getting in trouble for stupid shit that 13 year old boys do, he usually stops after he gets a verbal warning. We've never had any major issues with his behavior \n4)Yes, the teacher was aware of his episodes", "created_utc": 1689009610, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w06da/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sons_teacher_and_making/", "score": 5122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The teacher repeatedly yelled at your son, berated him, caused him to injure himself physically and quite possibly scared him away from communicating his needs in the future. She is a bully. When confronted, she started lying to cover up her behavior, and eventually crying. Boohoo. That's what bullies do: bully, lie, then cry when not let off the hook. You losing your cool is completely understandable. Your parents don't need to have an opinion about it, and your wife is in your corner. Consult a lawyer. I bet the principal won't ask a lawyer to leave.", "NTA, she shouldn't have ignored your son. Especially because there was a protocol in place. It's a bad thing she lied.\n\nBut I do think that screaming is never the solution. You can also be angry and make a point without being verbally agressive.

She literally endangered your child's life b/c he didn't \"look sick.\" I don't remember those school floors being very soft, if he hits his head the right way it can cause life-long complications. With that in mind, it might not hurt to have your son looked over even if he says he feels fine.

Also as someone who still has troubles advocating for their own rights I would maybe  get a therapist for your child to help them learn to advocate for themselves while of course still letting them know that you will always advocate for them. I don\u2019t even like kids and I would have gone down there and screamed at the principal and the teacher for a random stranger.

I\u2019m sure you have something in place for the school (in the US we call it a 504) for the teachers and staff to know how to handle medical situations for your child. Which means you have sat down with the school (his teacher most likely included) and they are aware he will pass out and they know what safety plans have been put in place. Now I\u2019m going out on a limb here but you said your son has a history of of not telling and passing out. I also know that there is always a he said she said and the truth is somewhere in the middle. So I\u2019m going to say a slight YTA and only for one reason.

So long as you have recommendations from a doctor, it is fairly easy to put together and is legally binding.  \n\nIf you do have a 504 plan and she went against it, then you may have legal recourse if she went against the recommendations. \n\n\nI would recommend a follow up email to the principal and the teacher. I would apologize for losing your cool, but say that was the reaction of a parent who is deeply concerned about the safety of his child. Go through a sequence of events that happened that day and how they go against the plan for your son. Ask why the plan was not followed. If you don't have a 504, at this point, demand one. If you do have one, refer to the pages of the plan and what was supposed to happen.

I used to be a teacher, and kids lie ALL THE TIME. \n\nWhat I mean is this: \n\n* If I have a student in my class with a documented medical condition, I will believe them if they tell me something is wrong. If they don't, kid, I don't trust you as far as I can throw you, and I have no upper body strength.\n* You are getting this story second hand from your student. I don't doubt that the main beats are more or less accurate, but I do doubt that the teacher \"yelled\" at him. They might have said something sternly, but there's kind of an important difference. One is unprofessional, and the other isn't. I bet that about 70% of your student's story has a basis in truth.\n\nNow, you suck for yelling. I know that tensions are high in a situation like this, but it's totally possible that a) your kid lies to their teacher all the time for no reason about stupid things, and b) if that teacher didn't know the medical condition is legit, you can't blame them. Again, kids are fuckin liars.\n\nMoving forward, make sure there is medical documentation with the school district. If you are unsure of how to do that, talk to your student's counselor. If they don't know how to do the documentation themselves, I guarantee they will know who to contact who *would* know.\n\nI just leave things with this: We all want the best for our kids. Trust that the teacher was trying their hardest, and try to remember that that teacher was not JUST dealing with your student. I would bet they had at least 25 other students in the same class whom they had to manage in addition to trying to teach them. Teaching is motherfucking difficult.

From experience, they will likely push back, but according to federal law they are required to conduct a meeting within a certain period of time after a parent request. Strongly request that the team develop a 504 plan for your son. This is similar to an IEP but is used when a child needs supports or accommodations but not academic or behavioral goals.

The teacher probably didn\u2019t yell but probably did ignore your son bc there was a million things going on and kids make excuses to not do stuff all the time. Obviously teacher could have handled situation better, but as a parent you should also have handled yourself better and tried to work out a solution.
