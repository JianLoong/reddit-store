My son has passed out a good few times before, so we've made sure he knows what to do when he starts to feel faint to make sure he doesn't hurt himself. However, when I arrived at the school my son was holding an ice pack to his head, when I asked about it the nurse told me he had hit his head when he fell, I wondered why he hadn't lay down like we taught him to do, I brushed it off and decided to ask him about it later as he was still kind of out of it. The next day I asked him about it and what he told me made my blood boil. Apparently when my son had first started to feel like he was going to pass out he tried to tell his teacher. When he stood up to talk to her he was immediately yelled at to sit back down. The next time he tried to tell her she told him that he didn't look sick so he wasn't allowed to go to the nurses office. Then,his class was doing an activity that required standing for practically the rest of the lesson, before the activity started my son, yet again told this teacher that he felt like he was going to pass out and asked if he could sit the activity out. The teacher responded by yelling at him, claiming he was just being lazy and was making excuses. My son's friend was getting worried about him so he told the teacher, who then started yelling at his friend, accusing them both of trying to get out of lesson. Not even a minute later my son passed out, and according to his friend and a couple other classmates, she acted very shocked, as if she hadn't been ignoring him trying to tell her how he felt for the last 5 minutes. I'm extremely worried about the impact this will have on my son, as when the fainting first started he didn't tell any of his teachers as he was scared that they were going to yell at him, this resulted in quite a few injuries from falling. It has taken a while for him to start telling them when he's feeling faint and I'm afraid this incident will cause him to stop asking and he will hurt himself.\n\nI had wanted to go down to the school that day but my son had stayed off and my wife wasn't home from work yet. The following Monday I arranged an appointment with the Principal. After I explained what had happened, he called in my son's teacher, who then tried to deny the fact that he ever told her anything and he had just randomly collapsed. This is where I may be TA. By this point I was pissed, I began to scream at her, yelling about how my son could have gotten hurt. I was so pissed I hadn't even noticed that she'd started to cry. By that point I was asked to leave by the principal. \n\n\nMy wife and some of my friends think I'm in the right, but my parents and the other half of my friends think I went too far. I don't know about this one \n\nWhat do you guys think, AITA?", "created_utc": 1689009610, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w06da/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sons_teacher_and_making/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At this point I think I would take my concerns to the Board of Education and let them know that you intend to speak with an attorney. Yelling at the teacher was probably not your best move, but I certainly understand when it comes to the safety of our children. It\u2019s hard to maintain our cool sometimes. I\u2019m going to say NTA.", "Did you inform the school that your son was prone fainting and have a protocol in place? What is the underlying medical condition that causes the fainting spells?", "NTA. The teacher repeatedly yelled at your son, berated him, caused him to injure himself physically and quite possibly scared him away from communicating his needs in the future. She is a bully. When confronted, she started lying to cover up her behavior, and eventually crying. Boohoo. That's what bullies do: bully, lie, then cry when not let off the hook. You losing your cool is completely understandable. Your parents don't need to have an opinion about it, and your wife is in your corner. Consult a lawyer. I bet the principal won't ask a lawyer to leave.", "NTA, she shouldn't have ignored your son. Especially because there was a protocol in place. It's a bad thing she lied.\n\nBut I do think that screaming is never the solution. You can also be angry and make a point without being verbally agressive. You also don't know how the ambiance was in the classroom, maybe the kids were teasing her and she thought that your son was joking around (it's not an excuse, I'm just trying to think of why the teacher would act like this).", "NTA - The teacher blatantly ignored what your son was trying to tell her and it backfired. She of course was going to try to save herself with the principal. Thank goodness your son wasnt hurt more.", "Nta she likes yelling at kids but can't handle being yelled at seems hypocritical", "NTA. Well, you didn't need to lose your temper, but you're only human. She didn't act human when she neglected his needs. He asked to go to the nurse, ffs.", "Info - Does the school know about this condition?", "NTA", "NTA, that teacher is a bully who deserved getting called out.  Yelling after she straight up lied is warranted.  \n\nIf you're in the US, please get this condition and his accommodations into a 504 or IEP plan if it's not there already.", "NTA sometimes manipulative people cry to get out of situations where they are at fault. Had she not lied about the situation and apologized it would have been different. But good for you for standing up for your child !", "NTA. The teacher is the AH", "NTA", "NTA, your teacher ignored him several times and as a result he passed out and injured himself, she shouldn\u2019t be a teacher anymore, she endangered his life.", "NTA. She has no business teaching children.", "NTA I think she needed that dose of reality for her negligence and dishonesty. She literally endangered your child's life b/c he didn't \"look sick.\" I don't remember those school floors being very soft, if he hits his head the right way it can cause life-long complications. With that in mind, it might not hurt to have your son looked over even if he says he feels fine.  He was just taught not to talk about feeling unwell, so he might try to hide it if he's not feeling 100%.", "NTA but do as much as you can to either smooth things over with the teacher or get him changed to a different class.\n\nThis will affect your son more than it will you.\n\nI hope you get a diagnosis soon. There may be a chance that he outgrows this. <3", "NTA whatsoever.\n\nPrincipal also did the right thing by getting you to leave before it escalated any further.\n\nI'd consider taking it to the super intendant or school board if their actions/remedy to this situation doesn't fit your needs \n\nYour child has a documented medical issue on file with the school, even though you don't have an actual diagnosis. This teacher, who is well aware of that, still chose to ignore it for some power trip reason, and your child was injured as a resilt. She deserves whatever happens to her.", "Crocodile tears don\u2019t break me or make me brake.", "I would honestly get quotes from the friend and other people that were in the class go back to the school talk to the principal again because that teacher knowingly put your child in danger and actively bullied the child that is NOT ok. Yelling and berating a child as an adult that has power over them is never ok that on it\u2019s own warrants going down to the school and talking to the teacher. Also as someone who still has troubles advocating for their own rights I would maybe  get a therapist for your child to help them learn to advocate for themselves while of course still letting them know that you will always advocate for them. I don\u2019t even like kids and I would have gone down there and screamed at the principal and the teacher for a random stranger.  Teachers who abuse their power and berate kids and are just nasty are disgusting I don\u2019t care if you had a bad week if you can\u2019t behave properly around children you should not work with them period.", "YTA. Why the h.e.l.l. would you put responsibility on your little son to negotiate/educate with his teachers about his medical issues and needs?  That\u2019s a parent\u2019s job.", "Info. Does your son have a 504 plan or something that has the written instructions for his fainting spells. There is so much more info needed before I make an opinion because right now you only have one side of the story.\n\nAlso losing your cool doesn't help anyone.", "NTA but I do think you made a mistake by screaming at the teacher and you owe her an apology. At least you know for sure this won't happen again.", "ESH\n\nYou're not the AH for going to the principal and wanting the situation handled, or for wanting to protect your son. The teacher is definitely the AH for refusing to follow protocol and endangering your child. \n\nWhere you are the AH is going off on the teacher to the extent that the principal had to ask you to leave. That takes a significant level of hostility. I'm wondering if you're perhaps leaving out some threats? \n\nI hope you get the medical issue sorted with your son.", "I think your anger took over and you responded like a scared parent. I\u2019m sure you have something in place for the school (in the US we call it a 504) for the teachers and staff to know how to handle medical situations for your child. Which means you have sat down with the school (his teacher most likely included) and they are aware he will pass out and they know what safety plans have been put in place. Now I\u2019m going out on a limb here but you said your son has a history of of not telling and passing out. I also know that there is always a he said she said and the truth is somewhere in the middle. So I\u2019m going to say a slight YTA and only for one reason. When you get overly aggressive like this\u2026the teacher heard nothing. As I have said to others\u2026if you\u2019re going to go nuclear don\u2019t be Chernobyl. When you melt down make it count.", "ESH\n\nYou need to demonstrate the use of your big boy words when something bad happens and not yell at the teacher.  \n\nGrow up\n\nAre you certain that the admin passed the information to this particular teacher?  \n\nYou may or may not be blaming the wrong person.", "Meh, nta good job yelling at her she need it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When he walked up in the morning be at his bedside. Put the equipment on first take his bp and get a hr then monitor him standing there for 10 minutes. If the blood pressure stays somewhat the same but the heart rate elevates at least 30 beats from resting for a sustained period\u2026he most likely has pots. If his heart rate is good but his blood pressure bottoms out he probably has orthostatic hypotension (the odds of this one are pretty low). The first line of treatment for pots is compression socks/pants, lots of fluid and extra salt lol. Every child\u2019s desire\u2026foods high in salt. It\u2019s getting a lot of recognition due to long haul covid but it can happen for a lot of reasons.", "If the school is aware you are nta but your beef should be with administration failure to inform teachers", "I agree that if what is being said is true then OP is NTA. BUT! I find it hard to believe that a teacher knows a student is prone to fainting and not only refused to allow him to stay seated during a strenuous task while he was feeling faint, but also actively yelled at him for saying so. This seems so outrageous that it's hard to believe", "Not just the school, but the teacher, personally. He can actually sue her.", "Where does it say that?  OP does not mention talking to his classmates just his son.", "All teachers were made aware of his episodes, I asked the principal before explaining what happened and he informed my son's teachers in a meeting a couple months ago, he said he specifically remembers her being there.

In kindergarten, my teacher yelled at me because I needed to use the bathroom at the same time every day.

It was humiliating and my mother also yelled at the teacher and made her cry.", "Sadly this isn't that hard to believe. Some teachers are just like that, I really don't know why. Something similar happened to a kid I knew in high school, he had asthma and had forgot his inhaler, but in gym we were doing laps around the field.
