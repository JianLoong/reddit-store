He is a very massive and strong horse, but usually  very gentle and calm. I have him standing in a private barn with a few  other horses.\n\nTwo days ago I  brought my friend f(22) with me. She's got two dogs, but I told her that dogs or any other animals aren't allowed at the barn. She agreed to keep them home, that's why I was shocked when she arrived with them. I was a little pissed at that  point and told her to leave them in the car. She got mad and said that she didn't want it alone for too long. I agreed for her to take them  if she kept them leashed. Eventually I got my horse and started prepping  him. Everything was going well but I noticed him being unusually nervous. I left to get the saddle,  leaving my friend, her dogs and my horse alone outside and that was a mistake.\n\nI wasn't even gone  for two minutes when I heard screaming and barking from outside. I ran back to find my horse tearing on his leash, frantically  trying to get away from her dogs which were jumping up at him, biting and barking  at him. My friend was screaming, hitting my horse with the end of her  dogs leash trying to stop him from kicking her dogs.\n\nI  don't really remember what exactly happened, but I remember one of her dogs suddenly laying on the floor, frantically panting and squeaking. My horse ripped his leash and ran of. Luckily he didn't ran too far.\n\nI  was crying at that moment, shocked about what just happened. My friend was  screaming at me while holding her dog in her arms. I was so confused and shocked. While my friend drove  of to the vet, some other people went looking for my horse while I was  talking to the barn owner and the police. I don't even remember who  called them.\n\nIn the end I almost  had a thousand dollar vet bill, because of the biting, injuries from  running of and her hitting him. While running off he also damaged some  of the fences and stuff around the barn, which were another thousand  dollars. My friend had a vet bill of almost three thousand dollars.\n\nYesterday, she demanded that I pay for it, since it's my horse who hurt  her dog. But I refused. I told her to leave her dogs home and I also  told her to keep them leashed because dogs around horses can be  dangerous. She knew about the dangers. I told her that she should pay for my bills, since without her dogs  it would've never happened. Almost everybody says that I'm being cruel since her dog could've died, but I still don't see it.

She should also be paying for your vet bill because she refused to listen and she physically caused damage to your horse, but you are far from blameless here. You were reckless.

You \\*both\\* fucked up here, and neither of you put the safety of the animals first.", "ESH\n\nYou made sure she knew to keep her dogs away from the horse.

Ultimately the responsibility ended with you. As soon as you saw her dogs that should have ended the visit. And then you left them all alone with your horse.

Why did you allow someone to trample your boundaries? \n\nI am assuming your friend had little experience around horses based on her behavior or just enough exposure to be a danger (meaning familiarity without wisdom).

When they arrived with the dogs you told them to leave them in the car.  They refused and brought the dogs creating a dangerous environment for everyone.  Their carelessness is what led to ALL the different animals injuries and the property damage that happened after.  However you did not hold firm and allowed her to stay with the dogs, so you are partially responsible also.  So everyone paying their own side of their bills is what I would deem fair.  If you want to pursue them paying your side or them trying to force you to pay theirs will mean an immediate end to the friendship if it is not already over.  Most likely a court will end up costing both sides more than they are likely to win in court as both sides have some fault in the matter.\n\nI would also like to make note that the fact that they whipped the horse with a leash to the point that it required some medical treatment is something that you will be dealing with for a long time as that horse is going to have mental trauma from the event.  Approaching that horse now with any reins, bridle, ropes, etc can trigger a negative reaction from it now that would not have been an issue otherwise.   \n\nYes it is unfortunate that a dog was kicked and could have died, but two dogs attacking a horse (depending on the dogs breed/size) could easily have ended up killing the horse, so I have no pity for them making bad choices and then shifting blame as if they played no part in causing this because \"my animal could have died\".  Honestly the carelessness here could have led to a human getting injured or killed so based on how it ended up there will be no remorse from me for anyone here.", "Of course the horse is going to kick out if a dog is bitting it.

The fact that you also let strange animals whose behavior you could not verify is also a problem.\n\nI think you're going to have to go to small claims court if you want this handled.

ESH.", "Then you should have gone to fetch a member of staff, and asked for backup.", "avoiding is allowing, and what you allowed is an almost dead dog and an almost seriously injured and lost horse. You saw your horse was nervous way before anything happened and still didn\u2019t do anything about it. a VERY strong ESH", "Being conflict averse doesn\u2019t free you from responsibility. You told her no, she violated that. Then you told her she could be near your horse if the dogs were leashed. You may not have been able to bar her from the property, but you shouldn\u2019t have taken your horse from its stall until she left. She doesn\u2019t like it? Too bad. \n\nESH.", "ESH. Your horse is more than a pet, it\u2019s an asset. A very large, expensive asset. I won\u2019t let my kids eat spaghetti on my $3000 couch and you can\u2019t just avoid conflict bc it makes you uncomfortable. Lessons were learned that day. I bet you won\u2019t make it again.", "You did. She didn't listen and above you wrote you agreed to have them as long as they were on the leash. You ignored the rule to make your friend happy and now you both a learning a hard lesson. You might not have the ability to kick her out, but you could have notified the owner too. You have just as much responsibility in this as her and you should really just come to terms with that and learn your lesson.", "If dogs are not allowed in the barn and you invited her to the barn, AND you allowed her to bring her dogs into the barn, it is 100% your fault. YOU broke the rules by allowing them to enter. You (I assume rent a stall/pay boarding fees) therefore anyone who you invite is your responsibility and you are liable for their actions. This is your fault. If I were the barn owner, I'd be doing what I can to get rid of you as a customer since you cannot follow the very simple and clear rules for the safety of every human and animal. \n\nYTA", "It's right. i did not involved the barn owner since dogs weren't allowed in general and I didn't want either of us to get in trouble. By now I really regret this decision.", "You should consider yourself lucky that it was YOUR horse that was hurt, because I tell you right now if my horse was hurt by the negligence of a fellow boarder who brought their non-horseperson friend with off-leash dogs to a barn with a no dog rule, there would be hell (and expensive vet bills) to pay, and the barn owner would absolutely be getting a \"me or them\" ultimatum.   \n\n\nESH. Do a better job advocating for your horse, or don't have one. This is not the last time you will find yourself in a situation that can get dangerous fast if you don't grow a pair.", "I do know that. But I've actually been in the barn since the very beginning. And even the owner is saying that it is not my fault. Yes, I made mistakes but I will keep them in mind for the future so this will not repeat. I know my mistakes there and got a second chance which I'm grateful for.", "Labrador Retriever and a mix from mexico", "Yes it could. But then the friend could say the horse was hit by someone else. Prove it was the friend. People tend to turn into slithery snakes when legal aspects are involved.... Normal self preservation", "Yes but she can say it was done to protect her dogs, while claiming that the horse attacked first.", "It's a shire horse?! Bloody hell. \n\nYour friend was really stupid to bring the dogs. And why were they standing behind the horse?! Everyone knows that's not a place you stand. I grew up with dogs and I would never let them get near a shire horse bc they could literally kill the dog (or a person!). \n\nBut the peeps on the thread are right- you should have put your foot down. No means no and you gave in to her, so you effectively gave your permission by not stopping her. I think both of you are at fault, but mostly your (no doubt ex) friend.", "Yep. Not to mention the other horses could have gotten spooked and hurt themselves. Can you imagine what the other horse owners would\u2019ve said?", "Thank you for making this point. OP gave her friend permission to break the barn's rules, despite fully understanding why those rules were in place. OP is responsible for her choices, and her friend is responsible for her own choices. Each woman should pay her own bills and learn an important lesson about following the rules.", "This. They are lucky that the horse was focused on the attacking dogs and didn't kick the human hitting it.", "You sure the barn isn\u2019t going to kick you out because of this? They should for their own sake", "There's also the dog bites. Friend really doesn't have a defense. If she had control of her animals they wouldn't have been close enough to bite or get kicked.", "I will definitely take it to court. A good thing about this is actually our barn security system which includes cameras all over the barn. I do not have any of the films yet but I hope we can see the situation on them.", "Civil suits have a different level of burden of proof than criminal ones. OP doesn't need to prove it beyond a doubt, she just needs to convince a judge that it's more likely than not. And I think, given her testimony and the evidence, a judge is more likely to believe OP over the friend.", "According to OP, other animals weren't allowed in the stables. Even if the friend claims she didn't know, she still would've been violating the stable's policies. It wouldn't matter that she was protecting her dogs, her dogs shouldn't have even been there.", "No, they're not. I am clear about my mistake and I did got really scolded for this but I got away with a black eye. I know my mistakes here and I will definitely keep them in mind for the future. I do not want this to repeat ever again and I am sure to say I learned from my mistakes here.", "Give us an update after you check the cameras! NTA", "This is all so frustrating and I\u2019m so sorry your horse is injured. Ugh. But at the end of the day, you did allow it. You could have said no and refused to allow her/them in the barn. Again, I\u2019m so sorry but that is kinda the basics of horsemanship. You have to protect them. Im so sorry.", "It very well could be small claims based on the amount, which generally means you represent yourself.  Would recommend you post this on r/legaladvice and ignore any legal advice you get in this thread since the only ones I\u2019ve seen are either outright wrong or at the very best misleading.", "I don't think you'll have a case based on that, since you should have sent her home immediately when you saw the dogs. Unfortunately any lawyer is gonna use that against you. You allowed it, you let them out of your sight etc.", "True. I was just playing devil's advocate as a reminder to cover all bases. I wholly believe she should sue her friend, I think the owner of the barn will have to sue directly for property damage, maybe coordinate with the owners and co-file?", "This was also my concern with taking this to court: OP retains some responsibility in this incident because she still brought her horse out despite knowing/allowing the dogs into the barn. She knowingly took on that risk, so this case might be somewhat murky legally. OP, I would consult r/legaladvice and based on the responses there I would then reach out to an actual attorney to see what the likelihood would be of you actually winning this case. The headache of pursuing this in court probably won\u2019t be worth if you\u2019re not likely to win", "Honestly as an animal behaviorist I was mortified reading this"]}
