Jenna remarried three years later and became a stepmom to a 2 year old and a 2 month old. She later had three more children with her husband. My family and I stayed very close to our grandchildren and we were still in Jenna's life but there was never much of a closeness there between Jenna and us. There have been bumps along the way. Including but not limited to issues when the kids wanted to spend time with us instead of her ILs, and when her stepdaughter's became upset about having less grandparents and wanting to be adopted by us. More recently Jenna was upset to learn our son had left money for the kids that was guarded by my husband and I. She learned this when Ella reached 18 and my husband and I discussed how she wanted to access the money. He left money with Jenna also but he wanted something that would be protected by someone else if he were to die. Jenna felt like it was unfair that Ella, Kai and Luca would have such a big start in life between our son's money and money my husband and I added to the account.\n\nThis is what leads into this next problem. Ella's youngest stepdaughter was diagnosed with cancer a few months ago. Treatments have cost them a lot and they want to go to another country with her for a different kind of treatment for her cancer, one that has shown great promise. The problem is affording all of this. Jenna wanted my husband and I to fund this. Either by taking money from my grandchildren's accounts to give for the treatment or by paying with other money. She said we clearly have access to more money than they do and it's the right thing to do, to hell with biology, because if we can pay for our grandkids to go to college and beyond, we should be willing to pay for a surrogate grandchild's life saving cancer treatments.\n\nI told Jenna she would not get any money from me, and would need to find another way to pay for the treatment. Ella and Kai already warned me that she had tried to get them to convince me. Luca is also having trouble with it but he said he's doing fine. Jenna is frustrated and angry and she told me I was cruel and soulless. I felt bad for her because I can see she is at breaking point and it appears that the marriage is having some trouble because her husband is also aware of the money and feels like it should be used for his daughter instead of college for my grandkids. So I am sympathetic to them. As a mother who lost her child I know that's agonizing. But I also want to look after my grandkids and honor my son's wishes.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your son left this money with you for you to protect, for his children. It is very sad about Jenna\u2019s stepdaughter, but it\u2019s not your responsibility to fund, and it\u2019s unfair of her to put pressure on the older kids to give up their inheritance", "Is it selfish not to pay for your step-daughter's cancer treatment? Sure. Is it selfish for you not to pay for random strangers' cancer treatments until you have nothing left? Technically, it is. But we don't live in a society that facilitates selflessness. If you donate all your time and money away, you are subsidizing a broken system. As a society we all need to step up and socialize healthcare. Billionaires should be footing the cancer bills. Not you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I'm sure they must be desperate though, so I sympathize with them too.", "NAH or perharps Jenna might be a bit TA but honnestly as a parent who has been through a lot of emmotional turmoil when my premature twins were born and in danger for several weeks, I have hard time judging harshly parents undergoing such situations.\n\nYou and your husband certainly aren't AH and she's certainly not entitled to your or your grandchildren money, on top of it she's been overstepping more than once and on that part i'd say she's an AH prior to the cancer thing.\n\nHowever seeing a baby suffering in hospital and being uncertain of the future can wreak the worst kind of havok in a person's emotions and bring out the worst of them, so in spite of being absolutely certain that you're doing the right thing, it's also understable that she might say or do things that are AHish.", "NTA, that money has your son set aside for HIS children.\nThat is not money that can just be given away or used for other things.\n\nI  don't understand why Jenna thinks she's entitled to money from you.\nIt's a terrible situation, but not one you need to solve. She has her own family and her husband's family. It is unfair to demand money from you.", "NTA.  You aren\u2019t responsible for paying for any kids let alone ones that aren\u2019t yours biologically.  \nYou\u2019re honoring your sons wishes and that\u2019s the furthest you need to tell them.  They can ask the new dudes parents for the money.  And they double down by using the kids against you to try to get you to pay for them? They are TA here.", "NTA. They are not your grandchildren. Even if they were, it would be tasteless of Jenna to expect you to pay.", "NTA. \n\nIts unfortuante whats happening to her stepdaughter. But it is your grandchildrens money. This has nothing to do with you.", "NtA. This is the reason your son left this money under your guardianship and didn't even tell his wife about it. He knew her, he knew what she would do and anticipated this. She would have spend/wasted this money a long time ago on things that she deemed as \" emergencies\".\n\nAnd using cancer and an expensive life saving treatment as a reason to get the money is just... mean. Is this a 70s harlequin book?\n\nBasically what she's saying is that the stepdaughter needs a cure and either you or your grandkids pay for it because the other grandparents(mother or father's side) or her and the child's father can't or won't pay for it. This is a lot of people not willing to fund this, so why should you.\n\nDon't do it. Protect your grandkids and their future. Honor your son's wishes.\n\nNtA", "NTA. Your are keeping money in trust and its not your place to break that trust. Dont give in the the emotional blackmail.", "NTA. Your former DIL and her husband has no right to that money.", "NTA..  the money you are guarding for your grandkids was put there for that reason. R u sure she hasn\u2019t used what she was guarding?  Feels like it", "Gotta say I was leaning towards a gentle you're TA until the last line of your post. You are honoring your son's last wishes and NTA. Their frustrations are understandable and the situation is heartbreaking but your son wanted to make sure HIS children were taken care of.", "NTA. I mean, you're doing what he asked. Which is fine. Did she ask you \"for other means\" because you could easily afford the treatments? I couldn't live with myself if I could afford to help a child beat cancer and I didnt bc they weren't blood, and God forbid they died. But... If you can...", "NTA. Honor your son\u2019s wishes. This is precisely what will\u2019s & trusts are for and wonderful your son had that all set in place. Also, my sincerest condolences in the loss of your son \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.  You are in no way required to cover medical expenses for a child you are not related to at all.  There is nothing wrong with someone asking for a donation.  But they should accept a simple yes or no.", "NTA\n\nClearly your sin made the right decision by leaving you in charge of the money. Otherwise your grandkids would never see it. \n\nAlso, you aren't being heartless. Your following your son's wishes. And honestly, lets say you did help this little girl with cancer treatment and she dies anyway. Then your grandkids would be out of a college fund for nothing. \n\nPrayers for the little girl.....", "NTA - yes your son left money for his children and you are right in preserving that for them to have when the time comes.\n\nHowever... you don't appear to be very sympathetic to the situation, a mother is concerned about her child and is looking for help...you are linked to your daughter in law no matter what, and as much it was a tragedy what happened to your son, would you really want her to go through losing a child.\n\nIt may be the way that you have written, however you can support the mother of your grandchildren in a number of different ways (not just financially) through what must be is an extremely difficult, upsetting and stressful time.", "NTA.", "NTA - they should respect that decision immediately and not feel entitled to it. Your sons money is for your grandkids. If anything, they should be grateful that the financial burden of your sons kids has been at least partially taken care of, which will allow them to focus on their sickly child.", "NTA- I really understand Jenna's desperation- any parent would be desperate to save their child, but THIS is not the way. I feel bad for your grandkids.", "NTA \"surrogate grandchild\" Wtf?! Her new family has nothing to do with you or your late son! It is awful that their child has cancer but that is their problem. It is their new family. And she has an own family as has he, why can't they pay for it?! To try to go after the money for the future of the children of your late son is just disgusting especially since one is just 15!", "Looks like OP's son knew what he was doing. I'm child free at the moment, but reddit and this sub made me realise I will make a will, if I get pregnant and in case I decide to keep it.", "Thank you!", "Most, if not all, of the money she had access to after my son passed would be gone by now.", "He did. More than anything he wanted to make sure his children were taken care of and that they all knew he loved them enough to plan for the worst happening. He was aware of how badly things can go when you don't plan ahead, as someone he worked with passed and he was painfully aware of drama in the family over the money he had left behind. He never wanted that for his children who were always his top priority.", "I agree. Asking once is fine but not to pressure or try to demand money. Though I understand they are dealing with so much right now.", "We are not close enough for any meaningful emotional support. I sympathize with her but our relationship has always been more distant than not, which is a shame, but not everyone is who you want at the worst moments in your life.", "The child isn't just \"sickly\". The child has cancer, not the flu. She/he will literally DIE without help.", "My grandkids are dealing with a lot right now. I'm glad they have each other and feel comfortable talking to me still. Luca is who I worry most for, as the one still living with his mom. He might be living with more pressure on a daily basis than we realize.", "It doesn't sound like her family would be willing to help with this at all. They seem to have grown apart more in the last few years because her family did not accept her stepdaughters.", "And that is why your som left with you. To see to the future.  As hard as this is i think your doing the right thing. .", "Awww.. he gave the money to the right people OP. You're doing a good job!", "I'm aware of the scenario as I read it. I did not ask nor care for your opinion. This is not a debate sub. Read the rules. Share your opinion with OP separately.", "Maybe you should also step back. Except for the three children of your son.\n\nYou can't win. But your son wanted to secure the future of his children after his death. If you have enough money that it won't hurt you to give her a little... but don't touch the money of the children. The parents can take of loans, create a GuFundme."]}
