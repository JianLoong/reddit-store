I do tend to draw out stories and over explain sometimes so even though I did get a little upset I apologized after crying a bit because I felt overwhelmed. We then began driving around looking for a place to eat and during the whole drive he was stand off ish and constantly telling me things I was doing wrong. At this point I snapped and told him if he hates everything about me that much then to just dump me and then he said to take him home and we broke up. I wouldn\u2019t of minded him addressing the issues in a nice and caring way but it hurt a lot being called annoying and saying no one will like me if I do those things.

His anger and frustration is probably projection because of how useless he feels. But as someone who has suffered from depression there's no point talking about it without being proactive about changing habits. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if drugs or alcohol were involved if he's that debilitated.", "You're NTA and it's probably for the best that you go your separate ways.", "NTA, move on.  You\u2019re young and should dwell on his ass.", "NTA. You're better off without his ungrateful ass.", "NTA.\n\n***Congratulations on your recent weight loss!!! Losing the dead weight of that loser looks great on you!***\n\nKick his ass the fleep out!!! He was using you and projecting. \n\nEnjoy your freedom!", "NTA. You're both in a stressful domestic situation, you being overworked and his hands being idle. You no doubt put up with all sorts of nonsense at work, the last thing you wanted after a shitty day was more nonsense at home.\n\nLet things settle, perhaps take a little break from work of you can. He also needs to work on himself.", "NTA, if he's not supportive, he's not worth supporting. You're 19. The likelihood of him being \"the one\" is pretty low regardless. You have a lot of life to live. Don't waste it on someone who makes you miserable.", "NTA, your freeloading ex is and it\u2019s good riddance he took the trash out himself.", "NTA\n\nBabe, run. Do not go back to him or entertain the fantasy of a relationship with him. I promise you - not even just the *right* person, but any *decent* person will NOT make you feel bad about yourself. Those quirks that your ex hates, someone else will love. \n\nI apologize for apologizing too much, and it\u2019s because of my ex I met when I was 17 and dated for 3 years. My next bf, although he had his flaws, never once made me feel back about my trauma or the quirks I developed because of my first ex. He took his time and showered me with love. \n\nMy point, he doesn\u2019t deserve you. And *you* deserve a whole hell of a lot more.", "i agree\u2026 i\u2019m always skeptic about someone who treats people like this. he has no job, possibly no funds to support and yet he is just soooo comfortable with breaking up. either he already has plans with someone else or his depression is truly taking a turn. unfortunately the ball is now in your court , drop him like trash or cater to his needs only if you WANT and NEED to."]}
