{"id": 23515, "submission_id": "15dzqdy", "title": "AITA because I got my daughter a $80 dress?", "selftext": "My family just got back from a weeklong cruise, and there is still some tension about this. My wife and I took our 20yo son, 16yo daughter, 13yo son and 7yo son. Our oldest spent most of his time on vacation doing his own thing, having breakfast and dinner with the family but being seldom seen otherwise. My wife and I enjoyed spending time with out kids, but we also did some couple's activities.\n\nThere are clubs on the boat for kids, and our 13yo really enjoyed them, but our 7yo didn't and kept wanting to spend the day with his sister, who we'd given carte blanche to do her own thing as long as she ate with us and answered when we messaged her. She was a good sport and took her little brother on most of her adventures, swimming with him, taking him to trivia and doing the animation classes with him. I felt like this was very sweet of her and showed a great deal of maturity. The second to last day of the cruise I took her to the gift shop and told her to pick out whatever she wanted as thanks for looking after her brother.\n\nShe was very excited and ended up picking out a dress. The dress was $80. She wore it to dinner that night, and when she told her mom I bought it for her my wife gave me a weird look. After dinner she asked me why the hell I did that. I explained that it was a reward for looking after her brother. She said we can't buy an $80 dress for our daughter and nothing for our sons. I said we didn't get them nothing; we took them on a cruise.\n\nMy wife said I'm an idiot. I don't think so. We got some trinkets for the younger boys, about $20 worth of stuff. My wife thinks I fucked up and said I should apologize to the boys. I refuse. We took our adult son on a vacation that cost thousands of dollars, he has no reason to resent his sister being rewarded for being thoughtful. If we got our 7yo and 13yo a really expensive souvenir, it would probably be lost or broken. She still thinks I was an asshole though.\n\nClarification: A lot of commentors seem to think we asked our daughter to babysit her brother. That's not really the case. What kept happening was that she would tell us her plans for the day and 7yo would say he'd rather do that than go to the kid's club, and she would agree to let him come with her. So it was more just her being a nice sister than actual babysitting. She always had the ability to drop him off at the club. That's why I wanted to reward her, because I thought it was so sweet of her not to do that and to make her brother feel good about his cool older sister wanting to hang out with him.", "created_utc": 1690759174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dzqdy/aita_because_i_got_my_daughter_a_80_dress/", "score": 299, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter stepped up when she didn\u2019t have to, and you chose to reward her, it was not something she expected or had her hand out for.

As for your other two sons, maybe your 13 y/o deserved something a little nicer than a trinket, but that's not really my place to judge.

So many 16 year old girls would have just been annoyed by their little brother wanting to tag along with them. I know I would have been at her age. The boys are old enough to know that we don\u2019t all get treated the same- sometimes when we do extra, we get extra. \n\nWhat your daughter did was extremely kind. I think it\u2019s really important that you acknowledged that, because too often in society it\u2019s taken for granted. I think you need to have a deeper conversation with your wife about why she has such an issue with it, because it makes me wonder if there is more going on.  \n\nAlways try to be nice, but never fail to be kind. Your daughter will remember this.", "NTA if you would have paid your daughter average babysitting rates of $20 and hour. You actually would have owed her $1120. You and your wife had a babysitter for 7 days I am assuming 8 hours a day for the amazing prize of $80.\n\nActually your wife is right your an idiot you owe her about 14 more dress of the same value. If your 20 something wants to complain. \n\nSo I would tell him and your wife that you took your ADULT son on a free vacation. If next time he would like a souvenir he can pay for his own ticket.\n\nIf he would like a souvenirs and a free trip then next time he can help your 16 year old babysit his 7 year old brother.\n\nYou can also tell your wife that next years vacation you need to pay a babysitter if she does not want to compensate your daughter for caring for a child she did not have too. A child you guys pawned on her and expected her to be a third babysitter.\n\nBecause your daughter didn\u2019t get a vacation because you guys used her instead of telling your 7 year old to hang with you or the clubs you took her trip and made it a job!\n\nYour 16 year old deserves better. Your wife needs to quit expecting your daughter to pick up you guys is parenting slack.", "NTA... but you should probably have told your wife you plan to buy something for your daughter so she didn't feel blindsided.\n\nYour daughter babysat most of the cruise. Seems just fair that she get remunerated, one way or the other.", "NTA. She did a great job with her little brother and deserves some acknowledgment for that while everyone else was \u201cdoing their thing\u201d.", "NTA - did the other kids babysit for you? No they didn't. Maybe if they find out, they will next time.", "NTA, you noticed and encouraged your daughter's kindness and sensitivity with a lovely gesture of your own. I find your wife's reaction very odd, though. You'd think she'd also be proud and gratified by daughter's behaviour, and understand that the gift signified your appreciation. Is it about money? Is your wife generally less emotionally intelligent than you and daughter are?", "Aw, your daughter is nice, and a really good big sister. I hope she enjoys the dress!\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Could your wife be one of those messed-up moms who weirdly wildly overvalue their sons at the expense of their daughters? It's a known, nutty thing.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA at all. Obviously I only know what you've told us but based on this limited information your wife sounds like she's being a jerk about this.", "NTA, and 80 bucks for a dress is a reasonable price.  Good clothes are expensive.", "YTA \u2014 It has nothing to do with the dress and more to do with squandered opportunity to connect with your family.  I assume you provide many opportunities for the kids and live busy lives.  Vacation should a time for connecting all of the family. They are a captured audience.  It most likely resembled your 50-week a year life: ate breakfast and dinner together and lived your own lives.  \nI\u2019m a parent of kids in their mid 20\u2019s.  We\u2019ll vacation together spend time together, not just spending time in the same zip code.  It\u2019s a tough road to create a connection between siblings who are 13 years apart and this was a missed opportunity.   You\u2019ll only get so many of those weeks, use them wisely.  \nNot really an AH, just trying to adjust focus.", "NTA", "NAH I think at the ages you describe you are just leaving the stage where this type of gifting won\u2019t matter. Pretty soon, your wife is going to be right, the kids will notice and they very well could be resentful. Small gifts can often blend into everyday life, but if $80 is a larger amount in terms of the gifts you normally give, it is better to make sure you even things out. I think because it was a dress/clothing, the boys are less likely to notice that it was a gift and expensive.  But if you bought her an electronic item or something mutually desirable, it can look like favoritism or a lack of fair treatment between siblings. Again, you are probably fine in this scenario. But if it will start to matter more in the teen years.", "\\[INFO\\] how often does it happen? Was it just this time or does she get special gifts all the time? I don't think your wife would be mad if it was something that happened just once. If she thinks you're playing favorites, there's probably more situations than just this one time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I don't think $80 dress is something that absurd, but at the same time I think it is waste of money to buy anything at the gift shop. The dress is probably worth $15 and was overpriced as hell.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your daughter did something your sons DIDNT do.  Why do they deserve the same things ? She\u2019s only going to prove to her daughter that people can take advantage of her and she shouldn\u2019t expect compensation for her time and efforts later in life.

That\u2019s not what happened.  My older sister was like your daughter.  I wanted to be with her all the time.  She always said OK.  She\u2019s 8 years older than me.  Teenagers don\u2019t always want there little siblings with them.  You didn\u2019t ask her to babysit and neither did my parents. Your daughter said she will take him and they enjoyed each other.

What did the others do for one?", "NTA", "NTA. I can't imagine a family dynamic that creates problems when one child gets a gift. We buy our kids significant gifts all the time and certainly not all at the same time. Nobody gets angry and nobody gets jealous. Even when they were little and in those selfish \"mine!\" stages it was never an issue. I get my daughter nice things for her college dorm, no issue. I get my youngest son an expensive gaming computer, nobody cries. I take another child shopping for new clothes, again, everyone is content. You have to teach your kids that buying gifts for one doesn't mean the others are less important.", "NTA but also for any future trips and anyone else reading, don't let your kids wander a cruise ship alone. People disappear on cruise ships. Though it's presumed most fall overboard, there's also substantial evidence to indicate people get trafficked during stops at ports.

She's making it a bad thing so they'll see it as \"we should get things too.\" forever instead of \"we don't always get stuff just because sister does and going above and beyond to be considerate is rewarded\".

She could have taken him to the kids club, but she chose not to, so he rewarded her with a dress because that's what she wanted.", "Well, she did offer despite the fact that the kid could have been dropped off at the kid's club. It doesn't sound like anyone forced her to watch over the kid; instead, it sounds like she preferred having him join in on her activities.It sounds like she really enjoys time with her younger sibling. Just as there are some ppl that prefer being alone, there are going to be some that love spending time with others, even their much younger siblings.", "Maybe yeah, it was a little unfair to the daughter, but they never forced her to take the 7 yr old with her.

The dress she got was a reward, because an older sibling taking care of a younger sibling WILLINGLY is (I think) rare and shows maturity.", "Well first of all NTA, the dress was a special gift and something she earned. What did the boys do to earn a special gift? The reason I asked for info is, if they boys weren\u2019t concerned or upset why does it matter? If you concede to your wife and apologize (which I don\u2019t think you should do) it might end up making them upset. Why do that? This is all really silly to me.", "yeah on the next vacay I'd make it a point to let the sixteen year old run free and enjoy herself and stick mom with the younger kid---every.single.day.", "They where being the precious boys they are meant to be!", "Yeah it the lack of gratitude from\nThe mom and her thinking that what the daughter did was not worth a measly $80 dress. \n\nWhen the daughter is the one that stepped up and was the parent for\nThe week. \n\nThe fact mom has the audacity and entitlement to think that it was ok to dump her 7 year old on the 16 year old while she went and had the time of her life. \n\nI wonder how many times this happens at home that op doesn\u2019t know about! Where mom dumbs her responsibilities on the daughter to deal with! \n\n\nMom sucks as a parent! At least op try to show appreciation! He needs to step up and shut down mom using the daughter! She is not the damn parent op and the precious wife are!", "It kind of makes me wonder if this is a blended family and the 16 year old his her step daughter."]}
