{"id": 23515, "submission_id": "15dzqdy", "title": "AITA because I got my daughter a $80 dress?", "selftext": "My family just got back from a weeklong cruise, and there is still some tension about this. My wife and I took our 20yo son, 16yo daughter, 13yo son and 7yo son. Our oldest spent most of his time on vacation doing his own thing, having breakfast and dinner with the family but being seldom seen otherwise. My wife and I enjoyed spending time with out kids, but we also did some couple's activities.\n\nThere are clubs on the boat for kids, and our 13yo really enjoyed them, but our 7yo didn't and kept wanting to spend the day with his sister, who we'd given carte blanche to do her own thing as long as she ate with us and answered when we messaged her. She was a good sport and took her little brother on most of her adventures, swimming with him, taking him to trivia and doing the animation classes with him. I felt like this was very sweet of her and showed a great deal of maturity. The second to last day of the cruise I took her to the gift shop and told her to pick out whatever she wanted as thanks for looking after her brother.\n\nShe was very excited and ended up picking out a dress. The dress was $80. She wore it to dinner that night, and when she told her mom I bought it for her my wife gave me a weird look. After dinner she asked me why the hell I did that. I explained that it was a reward for looking after her brother. She said we can't buy an $80 dress for our daughter and nothing for our sons. I said we didn't get them nothing; we took them on a cruise.\n\nMy wife said I'm an idiot. I don't think so. We got some trinkets for the younger boys, about $20 worth of stuff. My wife thinks I fucked up and said I should apologize to the boys. I refuse. We took our adult son on a vacation that cost thousands of dollars, he has no reason to resent his sister being rewarded for being thoughtful. If we got our 7yo and 13yo a really expensive souvenir, it would probably be lost or broken. She still thinks I was an asshole though.\n\nClarification: A lot of commentors seem to think we asked our daughter to babysit her brother. That's not really the case. What kept happening was that she would tell us her plans for the day and 7yo would say he'd rather do that than go to the kid's club, and she would agree to let him come with her. So it was more just her being a nice sister than actual babysitting. She always had the ability to drop him off at the club. That's why I wanted to reward her, because I thought it was so sweet of her not to do that and to make her brother feel good about his cool older sister wanting to hang out with him.", "created_utc": 1690759174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dzqdy/aita_because_i_got_my_daughter_a_80_dress/", "score": 2066, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The boys are old enough to know that we don\u2019t all get treated the same- sometimes when we do extra, we get extra. \n\nWhat your daughter did was extremely kind. I think it\u2019s really important that you acknowledged that, because too often in society it\u2019s taken for granted. I think you need to have a deeper conversation with your wife about why she has such an issue with it, because it makes me wonder if there is more going on.  \n\nAlways try to be nice, but never fail to be kind. Your daughter will remember this.", "NTA if you would have paid your daughter average babysitting rates of $20 and hour. You actually would have owed her $1120. You and your wife had a babysitter for 7 days I am assuming 8 hours a day for the amazing prize of $80.\n\nActually your wife is right your an idiot you owe her about 14 more dress of the same value.

A child you guys pawned on her and expected her to be a third babysitter.\n\nBecause your daughter didn\u2019t get a vacation because you guys used her instead of telling your 7 year old to hang with you or the clubs you took her trip and made it a job!\n\nYour 16 year old deserves better.

No they didn't. Maybe if they find out, they will next time.", "NTA, you noticed and encouraged your daughter's kindness and sensitivity with a lovely gesture of your own. I find your wife's reaction very odd, though. You'd think she'd also be proud and gratified by daughter's behaviour, and understand that the gift signified your appreciation. Is it about money? Is your wife generally less emotionally intelligent than you and daughter are?", "Aw, your daughter is nice, and a really good big sister. I hope she enjoys the dress!\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Could your wife be one of those messed-up moms who weirdly wildly overvalue their sons at the expense of their daughters? It's a known, nutty thing.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA at all. Obviously I only know what you've told us but based on this limited information your wife sounds like she's being a jerk about this.", "NTA, and 80 bucks for a dress is a reasonable price.  Good clothes are expensive.", "YTA \u2014 It has nothing to do with the dress and more to do with squandered opportunity to connect with your family.  I assume you provide many opportunities for the kids and live busy lives.  Vacation should a time for connecting all of the family. They are a captured audience.  It most likely resembled your 50-week a year life: ate breakfast and dinner together and lived your own lives.  \nI\u2019m a parent of kids in their mid 20\u2019s.  We\u2019ll vacation together spend time together, not just spending time in the same zip code.  It\u2019s a tough road to create a connection between siblings who are 13 years apart and this was a missed opportunity.   You\u2019ll only get so many of those weeks, use them wisely.  \nNot really an AH, just trying to adjust focus.", "NTA", "NAH I think at the ages you describe you are just leaving the stage where this type of gifting won\u2019t matter. Pretty soon, your wife is going to be right, the kids will notice and they very well could be resentful. Small gifts can often blend into everyday life, but if $80 is a larger amount in terms of the gifts you normally give, it is better to make sure you even things out. I think because it was a dress/clothing, the boys are less likely to notice that it was a gift and expensive.  But if you bought her an electronic item or something mutually desirable, it can look like favoritism or a lack of fair treatment between siblings. Again, you are probably fine in this scenario. But if it will start to matter more in the teen years.", "\\[INFO\\] how often does it happen? Was it just this time or does she get special gifts all the time? I don't think your wife would be mad if it was something that happened just once. If she thinks you're playing favorites, there's probably more situations than just this one time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I don't think $80 dress is something that absurd, but at the same time I think it is waste of money to buy anything at the gift shop.

Your daughter did something your sons DIDNT do.  Why do they deserve the same things ?

We buy our kids significant gifts all the time and certainly not all at the same time. Nobody gets angry and nobody gets jealous.

She obviously loves her little brother very much and there\u2019s nothing wrong with you also showing your love for her. Your wife is giving really negative energy towards this situation.

Daughter graciously gave up her time to be a teen on her own accord to include her youngest sibling. That\u2019s kind, she didn\u2019t have to, and she does deserve something to appreciate that kindness. \n\nIt seems all your kids are happy. Your wife is wildly over thinking this. Daughter is not an automatic care taker, but her kindness gave you all a break as well.

Even when I had the hardest exams of my life I was still expected to study while dog sitting dogs who constantly bark. If I get my results back and I've failed, it wouldn't suprise me if it's due to the amount of dog sitting I have to do. Bae in mind these dogs are treated better then kids. Multiple hour long massage, meat for breakfast, lunch and dinner(there gonna end up malnourished so I always give them dog food), constant treats, played with for long periods of time and atleast 2 hour walks a day, sometimes walked multiple times a day. Yet I get complained at for not having a job, how on earth could I get a job when I'm expected to dog sit 5 days a week. I should be getting paid for this, growing up I was basically just free labour and still am. \n\nMeanwhile my brother NEVER looked after them once and got EVERYTHING handed to him and showed in gifts, despite him being nothing but a pain.

No, it'll even out in the long-term.  If another one needs help with childcare for a few weeks or months, are you going to have to provide equal childcare to the others?

Probably not.", "Why would this matter lol", "Money aside, the fact he took the time to take her shopping and told her \"pick whatever you want\" puts the experience on a different level.
