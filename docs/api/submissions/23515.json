{"id": 23515, "submission_id": "15dzqdy", "title": "AITA because I got my daughter a $80 dress?", "selftext": "My family just got back from a weeklong cruise, and there is still some tension about this. My wife and I took our 20yo son, 16yo daughter, 13yo son and 7yo son. Our oldest spent most of his time on vacation doing his own thing, having breakfast and dinner with the family but being seldom seen otherwise. My wife and I enjoyed spending time with out kids, but we also did some couple's activities.\n\nThere are clubs on the boat for kids, and our 13yo really enjoyed them, but our 7yo didn't and kept wanting to spend the day with his sister, who we'd given carte blanche to do her own thing as long as she ate with us and answered when we messaged her. She was a good sport and took her little brother on most of her adventures, swimming with him, taking him to trivia and doing the animation classes with him. I felt like this was very sweet of her and showed a great deal of maturity. The second to last day of the cruise I took her to the gift shop and told her to pick out whatever she wanted as thanks for looking after her brother.\n\nShe was very excited and ended up picking out a dress. The dress was $80. She wore it to dinner that night, and when she told her mom I bought it for her my wife gave me a weird look. After dinner she asked me why the hell I did that. I explained that it was a reward for looking after her brother. She said we can't buy an $80 dress for our daughter and nothing for our sons. I said we didn't get them nothing; we took them on a cruise.\n\nMy wife said I'm an idiot. I don't think so. We got some trinkets for the younger boys, about $20 worth of stuff. My wife thinks I fucked up and said I should apologize to the boys. I refuse. We took our adult son on a vacation that cost thousands of dollars, he has no reason to resent his sister being rewarded for being thoughtful. If we got our 7yo and 13yo a really expensive souvenir, it would probably be lost or broken. She still thinks I was an asshole though.\n\nClarification: A lot of commentors seem to think we asked our daughter to babysit her brother. That's not really the case. What kept happening was that she would tell us her plans for the day and 7yo would say he'd rather do that than go to the kid's club, and she would agree to let him come with her. So it was more just her being a nice sister than actual babysitting. She always had the ability to drop him off at the club. That's why I wanted to reward her, because I thought it was so sweet of her not to do that and to make her brother feel good about his cool older sister wanting to hang out with him.", "created_utc": 1690759174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dzqdy/aita_because_i_got_my_daughter_a_80_dress/", "score": 11308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You basically paid her for babysitting.", "NTA. But your wife sure is. Shame on her. Tell her she can then pay your daughter day care fees for taking care of HER child if she has such a problem with you buying her a gift. After all, your son isn't your daughter's responsibility. You did a good thing. Your wife sounds jealous of her own child.", "NTA! Your daughter is a gem! The value of her babysitting was probably WAY over $80. \n\nTry to frame it for your wife as her payment for babysitting so much. It's not a gift, it's something she earned by going above and beyond what you expected of her as an older sister.", "NTA Let\u2019s get this straight, your only daughter, took over the role of mom/babysitter for the week, so you and your wife could enjoy the cruise, while your other boys did what they wanted. Your daughter stepped up when she didn\u2019t have to, and you chose to reward her, it was not something she expected or had her hand out for.

It sounds like no one else cared.\n\n\nHonestly, this was a nice gesture for your daughter looking after her brother.", "NTA and $80 for a dress that she can wear many times is so reasonable.

That your wife can't see that and thinks you need to *apologize* makes me suspect she favours the boys.", "NTA\n\nGenerally it\u2019s good to largely treat your kids the same, but rewards-within reason- are different.\n\nThe key is to make sure the other kids also get treats as do above and beyond behavior and it\u2019s not a true one shot.", "NTA!!\n\nYour daughter is *16* as a former 16 y/o female, I probably wouldn't have wanted to even go on the cruise, much less watch my younger brother most of the time- especially if I was promised independence for the trip. \n\nShe took up the responsibility of watching a younger child without being voluntold and without complaint. That warrents at least *something* as a little treat, it shows you really *did* appreciate what she did. \n\nI *kind of* get where your wife is coming from, but I know my dad would've made me pay back my share of the trip (I'm 21 now), or act as baby sitter the whole time as payment. As for your other two sons, maybe your 13 y/o deserved something a little nicer than a trinket, but that's not really my place to judge.

Does she keep a spread sheet somewhere to make sure she never spends more than $10 extra on any kid.  How much effort does she put into this fairness.  God I'm glad I was raised in a family that isn't this petty about money.", "NTA, your adult son didn't have to pay for vacation and can thus theoretically afford souvenirs.

You\u2019re a great dad.", "NTA", "NTA, quite the opposite", "NTA\nno one else seemed to care except your wife, or even notice.

So many 16 year old girls would have just been annoyed by their little brother wanting to tag along with them. I know I would have been at her age. The boys are old enough to know that we don\u2019t all get treated the same- sometimes when we do extra, we get extra. \n\nWhat your daughter did was extremely kind. I think it\u2019s really important that you acknowledged that, because too often in society it\u2019s taken for granted. I think you need to have a deeper conversation with your wife about why she has such an issue with it, because it makes me wonder if there is more going on.  \n\nAlways try to be nice, but never fail to be kind. Your daughter will remember this.", "NTA if you would have paid your daughter average babysitting rates of $20 and hour. You actually would have owed her $1120. You and your wife had a babysitter for 7 days I am assuming 8 hours a day for the amazing prize of $80.\n\nActually your wife is right your an idiot you owe her about 14 more dress of the same value. If your 20 something wants to complain. \n\nSo I would tell him and your wife that you took your ADULT son on a free vacation. If next time he would like a souvenir he can pay for his own ticket.\n\nIf he would like a souvenirs and a free trip then next time he can help your 16 year old babysit his 7 year old brother.\n\nYou can also tell your wife that next years vacation you need to pay a babysitter if she does not want to compensate your daughter for caring for a child she did not have too. A child you guys pawned on her and expected her to be a third babysitter.\n\nBecause your daughter didn\u2019t get a vacation because you guys used her instead of telling your 7 year old to hang with you or the clubs you took her trip and made it a job!\n\nYour 16 year old deserves better. Your wife needs to quit expecting your daughter to pick up you guys is parenting slack.", "NTA... but you should probably have told your wife you plan to buy something for your daughter so she didn't feel blindsided.\n\nYour daughter babysat most of the cruise. Seems just fair that she get remunerated, one way or the other.", "NTA. She did a great job with her little brother and deserves some acknowledgment for that while everyone else was \u201cdoing their thing\u201d.", "NTA - did the other kids babysit for you? No they didn't. Maybe if they find out, they will next time.", "NTA, you noticed and encouraged your daughter's kindness and sensitivity with a lovely gesture of your own. I find your wife's reaction very odd, though. You'd think she'd also be proud and gratified by daughter's behaviour, and understand that the gift signified your appreciation. Is it about money? Is your wife generally less emotionally intelligent than you and daughter are?", "Aw, your daughter is nice, and a really good big sister. I hope she enjoys the dress!\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Could your wife be one of those messed-up moms who weirdly wildly overvalue their sons at the expense of their daughters? It's a known, nutty thing.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA at all. Obviously I only know what you've told us but based on this limited information your wife sounds like she's being a jerk about this.", "NTA, and 80 bucks for a dress is a reasonable price.  Good clothes are expensive.", "YTA \u2014 It has nothing to do with the dress and more to do with squandered opportunity to connect with your family.  I assume you provide many opportunities for the kids and live busy lives.  Vacation should a time for connecting all of the family. They are a captured audience.  It most likely resembled your 50-week a year life: ate breakfast and dinner together and lived your own lives.  \nI\u2019m a parent of kids in their mid 20\u2019s.  We\u2019ll vacation together spend time together, not just spending time in the same zip code.  It\u2019s a tough road to create a connection between siblings who are 13 years apart and this was a missed opportunity.   You\u2019ll only get so many of those weeks, use them wisely.  \nNot really an AH, just trying to adjust focus.", "NTA", "NAH I think at the ages you describe you are just leaving the stage where this type of gifting won\u2019t matter. Pretty soon, your wife is going to be right, the kids will notice and they very well could be resentful. Small gifts can often blend into everyday life, but if $80 is a larger amount in terms of the gifts you normally give, it is better to make sure you even things out. I think because it was a dress/clothing, the boys are less likely to notice that it was a gift and expensive.  But if you bought her an electronic item or something mutually desirable, it can look like favoritism or a lack of fair treatment between siblings. Again, you are probably fine in this scenario. But if it will start to matter more in the teen years.", "\\[INFO\\] how often does it happen? Was it just this time or does she get special gifts all the time? I don't think your wife would be mad if it was something that happened just once. If she thinks you're playing favorites, there's probably more situations than just this one time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I don't think $80 dress is something that absurd, but at the same time I think it is waste of money to buy anything at the gift shop. The dress is probably worth $15 and was overpriced as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWow, people here are really smart, downvoting me for wanting more info on the case.

Your daughter did something your sons DIDNT do.  Why do they deserve the same things ? She\u2019s only going to prove to her daughter that people can take advantage of her and she shouldn\u2019t expect compensation for her time and efforts later in life.

That\u2019s not what happened.  My older sister was like your daughter.  I wanted to be with her all the time.  She always said OK.  She\u2019s 8 years older than me.  Teenagers don\u2019t always want there little siblings with them.  You didn\u2019t ask her to babysit and neither did my parents. Your daughter said she will take him and they enjoyed each other.

What did the others do for one?", "NTA", "NTA. I can't imagine a family dynamic that creates problems when one child gets a gift. We buy our kids significant gifts all the time and certainly not all at the same time. Nobody gets angry and nobody gets jealous. Even when they were little and in those selfish \"mine!\" stages it was never an issue. I get my daughter nice things for her college dorm, no issue.

It doesn't sound like anyone forced her to watch over the kid; instead, it sounds like she preferred having him join in on her activities.It sounds like she really enjoys time with her younger sibling. Just as there are some ppl that prefer being alone, there are going to be some that love spending time with others, even their much younger siblings.", "Maybe yeah, it was a little unfair to the daughter, but they never forced her to take the 7 yr old with her. She was fine with hanging out with her little brother and still seemed to enjoy the time spent. The dress she got was a reward, because an older sibling taking care of a younger sibling WILLINGLY is (I think) rare and shows maturity.", "Well first of all NTA, the dress was a special gift and something she earned.

And frankly we learned that it\u2019s a whole lot more fun to be the one giving the gift than to be the one receiving it.  \n\nGood on you for raising children that look out for one another, and who are being taught to value one another.  Your children will hopefully have one another in their lives much longer than they will have their parents.  Do all you can do to foster those relationships.", "NTA. You know all those posts of young adults asking if they\u2019re the A H for getting mad at family and disappearing because they\u2019re always expected to babysit? This is the complete opposite in a good way! You\u2019re teaching your daughter to value herself. She did the work and she deserves the credit. She also is learning to show appreciation and be appreciated. You are making sure she doesn\u2019t feel taken advantage of. Bringing a seven year old around all day sometimes isn\u2019t the easiest.\n\nAlso, your 7 year old is going to remember this vacation with great memories because of the daughter. That\u2019s amazing!", "NTA. The opposite! Good parent medal award winner!", "NTA \n\nI'm not gonna bash the wife, because her main concern is favoritism. She does not want the other children to think your daughter gets preferential treatment. \n\nHowever she is mistaken. Equal and fair treatment are not one in the same. \n\nYour daughter was not expected to babysit, but she opted to anyway. I suspect it was as much for herself as her brother as it's pretty boring bumming around somewhere alone without any companions.she wasn't looking for payment or asking for anything in return. However she did take on the responsibility of caring for her little brother regardless. Had she been asked to babysit payment would've been fair. A reward was perfectly acceptable. \n\nThe oldest could've easily opted to do the same. And also then got a thank you gift. He opted to take the fully paid vacation for himself. \n\nThe 13 year old could've also opted to hang out with his little brother but apparently decided he wanted to do other stuff instead. \n\nThough, the 7 year old should've probably also received a good behavior gift. As he went with his sister without causing problems and behaved well. Yes he did get to go on adventures he otherwise wouldn't have but he didn't have the option to be responsible for anyone else but himself. He's the only one who couldn't actually decide for himself what he wanted to do. He could ask but it wasn't up to him. It's a little unfair. He probably was perfectly happy with what he did get though. \n\nIt warms my heart to hear that your daughter did spend the vacation with the youngest though. I'm sure none of the others were envious of the dress. \n\nI do hope your wife realizes that treating everyone equal is not always the best route to go.

Felt nice not to be lumped in with the 7 y/o. \n\n7 y/o was absolutely giddy to spend one on one time with his big sis. Which I\u2019m sure is rare. Plus didn\u2019t have to do things his older brother (13 y/o) enjoyed, but he didn\u2019t. \n\nAt the end, ask if any of them begrudge your daughter her one extravagance.

What did the boys do to deserve a more expensive gift? What is the expectation she\u2019s communicating/setting here? What kind of female role-model is that? \n\nSecondly, perhaps your wife is _jealous_ of  daughter because they received a nice dress, but mum/wife didn\u2019t. Still not okay, though, because why is a mum comparing herself to her daughter and getting jealous over it? \n\nShe ought to re-examine her thoughts and biases towards women, their role in society, and how she could be projecting this onto her daughter.

I don't think it's super rare for older siblings to enjoy the company of their younger siblings!", "Totally made up. I mean MAYBE but it's more likely that we're not being given the full story.", "My mother doesn't have a lot but she is very generous still. She is quite adamant about giving us an equal amount, and I think it's due to my 2 older siblings having a different dad and not wanting to have favorites and also because she has witnessed what inheritance squabbles can lead to. My brother was needed about $10.000 for help with a house (iirc) and so my mother gave $10.000 for me and my sister too with the admonishment that we should use it for a good investment (house, car or other big purchase) if not just saving.\n\nI don't think I or my siblings would care if one gets more than another but I appreciate my mothers approach.", "You don't know if the answer is \"no, we never bought him anything for babysitting\" or \"no, because he never did any babysitting\".", "I\u2019m a woman who is very valued in her family. People who are valued will not try to negate someone else\u2019s reward/goodness like insisting the brothers should also get something. Why can\u2019t the daughter shine alone? I get to shine a lot in my family.", "I get your point but thinking a 20 year old should/can pay for a cruise is insane. No need to diminish the 20 year old just to defend the daughter, he didn't do anything wrong. The parents aren't legally obligated to pay for anybody's cruise, plenty of parents have gone on vacations without their kids.", ">I don\u2019t think ANYONE deserves clothing that more than $20!\n\nPeople deserve things that bring them joy. Do you have a hobby that you spend money on? What if I told you nobody deserves an item that you buy as your hobby?", "The answer was \u201cno\u201d, not \u201che never babysat\u201d. So until OP says otherwise the \u201cno\u201d stands.", "While I can understand and agree with your second sentence, I don\u2019t see how this has to do with gender. \n\nGrowing up, several of my friends, male and female, had to watch their younger siblings. It was expected of them and they weren\u2019t rewarded for it. Now to be clear I thought (and still think) it was bullshit. It shouldn\u2019t be a child\u2019s responsibility to be a caregiver for their siblings. What\u2019s getting me though is that several people have made the assumption that the mothers reaction is only because she\u2019s a girl, but given the information we have I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fair take.", "My wife refuses to spend more tha $25 on a dress for herself and ALWAYS looks stunning.", "I also wondered if this was the case....", "Groups of singles often go on cruises, and I would argue they have more fun than anyone", "Not exactly the same thing, but my dad is like that. I guess gifts/acts of service (?) are his love language. Like when he'd leave to buy groceries and I asked him to buy me something sweet, he'd come back with a whole bag of different chocolates etc. \n\nMy mother was abusive, my dad was emotionally unavailable and pretty much an enabler, but I've always known and felt that he loves me. She'd say \"I love you\" to me all the time and it never felt genuine, the words meant nothing to me. He'd never say it, but he didn't need to. I always knew he did.", "Reading this makes me so happy that dads like this exist and that this experience happened and meant so much to you. But also so sad that my dad would never have done this and I never would have thought that it was something that dads even do.", "Awe!! This might be an off the wall suggestion, but you could frame the shirt in a protective frame and hang it up as decoration. Maybe with a picture of you and your dad nearby. And I don\u2019t mean having the whole shirt showing like a jersey but maybe the collar or neck area. Or where the details are the best. I don\u2019t know. Just a thought.", "Sure, you can look great in clothes that aren't expensive, but there's more to the quality of a dress than how it looks.", "In addition to finding a babysitter, they had the option of just not going on a cruise lol.", "In that case, I admire his confidence. At that age I would have been really awkward about rocking up to those sorts of things on my own.", "I think it's weirder that you're choosing her gender rather than anatomical reality.", "You don\u2019t know that they didn\u2019t keep checking in. \n\nThe sister was also amongst strangers. It\u2019s very possible they found comfort in each other and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Of course there\u2019s the possibility she only felt obligated, but why is it so far fetched she really was fine with her little brother hanging out with her? They\u2019ll always have the memory of that awesome vacation where they got to do some cool stuff together. OP doesn\u2019t mention the sister never having a moment to herself. And it\u2019s quite possible she didn\u2019t really want to be without family. Not all 16 year olds are burning to ditch familiarity at the first opportunity. \n\nThe crappy behavior in question is the mom having a tantrum over the sister being gifted a dress as if the brothers would even give a crap about it. There\u2019s no way to know for certain the details, but going off what was shared, she was fine with it and the only person who expected her to take on caregiving without compensation was her mother and we\u2019ve pretty much established she is a bit of a dink.", "I mean it doesn't take that much confidence for a 20 year old to hang out on a cruise and chill around other people their age. Unless you were a socially awkward 20 year old...that's like the prime time you will have the confidence to get some on a cruise.", "psst psst, guess what....VAGINA!!"]}
