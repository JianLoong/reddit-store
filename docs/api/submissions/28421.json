The doctors were never able to figure out exactly what was wrong with her. Cancer was the main suspect as her parents lost four of their six children to a rare childhood cancer that the four had. But cancer was ruled out many times. Due to the loss their parents and my best friend have suffered with the parents losing 5 of their 6 kids now, there have been some tensions regarding my three older niblings.\n\nMy brother and his ex had a toxic divorce and dynamic afterward. She hated SIL. So the kids hated SIL. There was never any uncertainty regarding that. They went out of their way to avoid spending time with her, they were often rude and disrespectful to her and at times, they were cruel to her as well. This is something my best friend and her parents witnessed and were aware of for many years.\n\nWhen SIL was hospitalized the kids would refuse to visit. A couple of times my brother brought them along and SIL would get very hopeful that the kids had wanted to be there. But that was never the truth and they would avoid as much as they could. The oldest stopped going once they turned 18. But the younger two were still dragged along from time to time.\n\nBefore SIL died she had wanted to see the kids but they all refused to go. They said they had no goodbyes to say and didn't care if she had stuff to say to them.\n\nOnce SIL was gone my best friend told my brother that he was not going to force his kids to come to the funeral. My brother argued that he could do what he wants. That he was her husband and has the final say and they are his kids and they should be there for their lost stepmom as well as for him and their younger siblings.\n\nThey have been fighting over this topic ever since. My best friend told him she does not want their hate present during the final goodbye. He denied his kids hated SIL. My brother asked me to jump in and \"tell her\" but I had to agree with my best friend and I said the kids should not be force to go if they don't want to. And that I do not believe they will want to go. My best friend said life has continued on as normal and they have not acted at all like someone has died in their family so that says everything.\n\nMy brother got mad at me for agreeing with my best friend.

I understand why your brother might want his kids with him at his wife\u2019s funeral. The children don\u2019t have to be sad about their stepmom\u2019s death to provide love and support to their other family members who are grieving at a funeral. I hope this is being explained to your niblings. My cousin hated my grandma, but she still went to her funeral to support and comfort her mother.

Her widower, the children's father just lost his spouse and could use the support of his family at the event. \n\nThe fact that the kids hate their former step mother so much more than their love to support their father during this time speaks volumes about the values they were raised with and what they prioritize as people. \n\nESH except the guy who wants his children so support him at his wife's funeral.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s sad that the kids hated SIL, but no one should be forced to go a funeral if they don\u2019t want to", "MTA but your brother sure is!

Oh, and his new wife was a friend of the family.  (sister of his sister's best friend).\n\nThink about the optics on that.  If we assume they dated for 12 months before they got married, that means they started dating when the youngest was 1.\n\nSo even if brother did nothing shady - the timing is enough to easily let the mother turn the children against them.  After all, he was dating a new woman while his ex was dealing with their baby, and other two young children.\n\nI don't think OP is TA at all (NTA), but it's not easy to guess where the toxicity is coming from.", "I understand. It's a long story but a lot of it is basically the same as what is already written out here.

It seems he married her when the youngest with his ex was 1 or 2. OP hasn't said anything to confirm if there was infidelity involved.", "> The fact that the kids hate their former step mother so much more than their love to support their father during this time speaks volumes about the values they were raised with\n\nHow can you say this when you don't know the children's side of the story?\n\nIt may be that they hated stepmother because she was sleeping with their philandering father while bio mother was pregnant with them. Who knows what their reason is. My point is, without knowing the reason for the children's dislike, how can you decide that their values and prioritization are wrong?\n\nIt's so odd when people jump in to provide judgement having heard only half of the story. Especially since OP's question is with regards to a different issue.", "We don't know this. In fact, it's entirely possible that their stepmom was OP's brother's affair partner.\n\nLet's do some math! SIL married OP's brother, the father of the the three in question, 14 years ago. The ages of the children today puts them at 5, 3, and 2 years old ***when he married the new stepmom***.\n\nHow old were they when former SIL divorced OP's brother? How long was it before he met future stepmom? It must have been in the two years between the birth of the youngest of the three and his marriage to new-SIL.\n\nThe only thing OP has said is that \"it's a long story\".

Men tend to remarry pretty quickly, regardless of if they start dating at a reasonable point. And it's very possible the divorce was initiated as early as during pregnancy with the youngest.", "And how does a 2 year old know that? They don\u2019t. Unless a parent deliberately poisons the relationship. My ex married his affair partner and I did everything I could to make sure my kid had a good relationship with their stepmom because that was what was best for my kid. Until my ex fucked around again and found out with his second divorce.", "The absolute determination of certain parents that children confirm to their vision of a happy family, notwithstanding reality, is bizarre and toxic.\n\nAnd dead SIL was as subject to that as anyone, unfortunately, asking for a happy family from her deathbed. Probably causing her husband to double down on it even harder. And even deeper alienation on the part of the kids.\n\nTherapists will get rich on this :-(", "Brother wasn't married to op's best friend. He was married to best friend's sister", "Either he cheated while ex was pregnant or after she gave birth or he left her to start another relationship immediately while she was still dealing with having a baby on her own. And got together with a family friend at that.", "> Thats the whole point of the sub?\n\nNo. We usually get a semblance of both points of view. That is why we have the 'INFO' option.\n\nGranted the OP's perspective of the other party's viewpoint is going to be biased. But there is at least an attempt to present the other party's perspective. If the OP does not provide it, posters say that they do not have enough info to make a judgment.", "It's possible, but unlikely imo. And divorcing during a pregnancy is a whole other matter, none of reflecting well on OP's brother.\n\nEDIT: And I'd add: what kind of woman marries a father of three young children after only dating for two years? Or in your scenario, what kind of woman marries a man that divorces his wife while she's pregnant with their third child?", "But the 5 year old would, especially if the patents ever fought over it where they could hear. And eventually those younger kids would ask about why their dad wasn't around, and the older could easily answer that.", "YTA. Best friend and you should have stayed out of it. Instead of demanding what he does, you should be there supporting him in every way possible. If he asked for your opinion, that is the only time that either of you should have responded but still left it with him. As an outsider, I do think the brats should not be invited since they won\u2019t provide emotional support for their dad or siblings.

They don't miss her, they never appreciated her and they don't belong at her service. Honestly, her family never needs to acknowledge those kids again. He can't force them to be decent people. The least he can do is keep them away from those of you who are grieving. \n\nNTA.

They must have their reasons for feeling the way they do and that should also be respected. I am sorry for your loss of your SIL, OP.", "I think where he was disrespectful was in allowing his children to be awful to his wife when she was alive", "Yeah, does he want them to make a big scene or say nasty, disrespectful things about her?", "Yes, the most disturbing part about this is that the kids wouldn't be attending the funeral for their step-mother, they'd be attending for their *father*. Funerals are for the living, not the dead. Sounds as if the kids don't care much about their father, either.", "There is no therapeutic solution for people being jerks to other people. They probably feel their feelings are justified and what would a therapist do about that? Talk at them and hope their entire perspective changes? They are old enough to refuse to go.

Was she?", "Also, a good therapist very rarely will tell someone they\u2019re wrong. Their job is to help the person express their feelings and understand them/ cope with them. Eventually the person themselves will hopefully realize if they misread the situation.", "And why is your immediate reaction that the brother is to blame in the toxic relationship?", "It wasn't. It's why I first checked for any replies from OP, then re-read the post and noticed that the oldest would have been 5 when OP's brother remarried. Than I did the math for the rest, re-read OP's only reply again, and became suspicious.\n\nOP still hasn't clarified what happened. But infidelity by their father and their future stepmom fits what OP has described more than a mother turning her children against the stepmom, imo.", "My dad remarried within about two years of my mother's death and there were three of us kids. It does happen... though goodness knows how he manages to charm these women.", "Did you know women can be abusive too? And that pregnancy hormones might exacerbate their abusive tendencies? Don't paint with such a wide brush.", "Divorcing during a pregnancy happens. \n\nGetting married within two years of divorce without cheating happens, and when we're talking about men it even happens *often.* \n\nIf dad only had visitation, a woman being willing to get as far as marriage to a guy with three kids after only dating for two years is believable. And honestly, \"Marriage fell apart while one spouse was pregnant\" is not some crazy turn-off that every woman will immediately avoid and are terrible people if they don't. Honestly, that's a bit of a puritanical mindset to say that \"divorce started will wife was pregnant\" = \"man left his wife while pregnant with his third child\". Most divorces are mutual, and sometimes couples continue to have sex through serious mutual marital issues and the marital issues continue through that, and therefore can theoretically end up finally deciding to initiate the divorce process during a pregnancy.", "I'm not sure I agree.\n\nThe oldest would have been 5 and the youngest 2 at the time of their father's remarriage.\n\nThere could have been infidelity on the part of the husband and there might not have been.\n\nNo one knows what goes on between an husband and a wife.\n\nYou can assume all you wish but no one really knows but the couple.", "Passed passed is a completely different situation than a still-alive ex with at least shared custody.", "Yes, but there is zero indication that this is the case here.

Keep in mind, this man wants to force his children to attend a funeral of a woman they hated.\n\nAnd you make a pretty mig assumption that father had visitation and not shared custody. And if he only had visitation, there would be a reason for that. Like he was fully at fault for the divorce.", "Which was my point. Everyone else is assuming the ex was \"poisoning\" the children against the stepmom and I presented what looks to me to be just as likely a scenario, and honestly fits the known behaviors of all. OP's lack of clarification just reinforces my suspicions.", "There's zero indication your suggestions are the case, either.", "There's zero indication of anything that you said too. You're just creating a story. That yes could be true but just as likely to be false", "My point is that there are a thousand possibilities that would make this timeline logical. One of those possibilities is he cheated. Another is that she cheated and he moved on quickly. Another of those possibilities is he didn't have custody so the woman didn't see it as a big deal he had three kids. Another was that he was being abused. Another is that he was abusive himself. And toxic just means issues, it doesn't mean any particular issue. We have no reason to assume this marriage fell apart because *he cheated on her,* just from the word \"toxic\" and the timeline. Yes, it's possible. But so are a thousand other things.", "The timeline is one. OP's unwillingness to explain what \"toxic relationship\" meant. The fact that these now-teens never once liked the stepmom.", "I see you've decided you're right.  Be blessed"]}
