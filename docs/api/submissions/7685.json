Since my fianc\u00e9 and I are childfree and because we plan to have alcohol at our wedding, we decided to have a childfree wedding with the age cutoff at 21. \n\nThis requirement so far has gone over well with most of our invitees (most of our invitees don\u2019t even have kids anyway so it doesn\u2019t make a difference for them). \n\nI do have one friend \u201cMel\u201d (20f) that I had to exclude from the wedding. After realizing that pretty much everyone else from the same social circle had been invited except her, she confronted me and demanded to know why she wasn\u2019t invited. \n\nI tried to explain that it wasn\u2019t personal and that I just didn\u2019t want to have to worry about underage drinking going on under my nose on my wedding day. \n\nBut Mel kept accusing me of being a bad friend. She argued that since we had drank together before it shouldn\u2019t be such a big deal, but I told her that it was different since we were both underage at the time (I was 20 and she was 18-19ish when we started drinking together). Now as an adult, I feel like I have a responsibility to prevent underage drinking, and as the bride, I feel like I have the right to have a childfree wedding.\n\nMel is unconvinced and keeps talking bad about me behind my back to our mutual friends and making snarky comments about me feeling superior. I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t just relax and let me have my wedding day the way I like.

For example - in the USA you CAN say the most hateful and disgusting things on social media, but your employer can still fire you because your values are different from their company's. The platform can still ban you. You have the right, but also the consequences.

She'll be fine.", "Honestly society (and reddit) needs to take a hard look at why \u201cchild free\u201d is such a trend. It\u2018s not inclusive, but since it\u2019s just a mother and just a child, apparently it\u2019s ok. \n\nPeople often *think* they\u2019re being independent and feminist. But if the people you always exclude are mothers (I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read a post where the issue was a male being excluded), that\u2019s pretty sexist. \n\nIt really just feels like hating kids is cool because people want to think they\u2019re more independent. If you don\u2019t want kids, fine, but if you think not having kids makes you a stronger, more independent female - you\u2019re sexist. Kids are people, why is disliking them different than disliking any other person?\n\nMany times it just creates a division among women - the \u201cmothers\u201d who these people think aren\u2019t independent (BS) and the women who *think* they\u2019re more independent.", "My cousin\u2019s wedding was last year and it was technically childfree, although I was 17 at the time and my other cousin was 19 (so not adults who can drink in the US) and we were still invited. When it was time to do the toast we told the waiter we were underage and he gave us sparkling cider instead of champagne, and then their open bar had nonalcoholic drinks as well (I got quite a few Shirley Temples that night). Childfree does not equal under 21. OP YTA", "And like\u2026wouldn\u2019t that be the bartender\u2019s issue, not OP\u2019s?", "And also OP is clearly insinuating to her friend that she's incapable of controlling herself around alcohol which is pretty insulting.", "And if OP really thinks of Mel as a child, she has been indulging in child abuse for the last few years by drinking with her. OP fiancee if you are reading this , get out before its too late.", "YTA moVE, showing how immature the OP\u2014- OP said Mel found  out she was excluded from the friend group.  The oh so mature OP,  didn\u2019t have the maturity or decency to try and explain the logic to Mel.  Instead Mel found out and tried to have a conversation.  Real maturity there  OP.  YTA.", "And not just stopping a 20yr old, but stopping someone about two years younger than her.  It's not like she's a 60 year old who doesn't want to deal with 20 year old 'kids.'  NO, this is some who is too good for someone she used to go out drinking with, when they were BOTH underaged.", "The weddings I went to that have been child free, still included anyone 12 plus or even 10 plus sometimes. They were really trying to keep the babies and toddlers out of the wedding because of how loud they could get/ how loud the wedding was. I've never heard of anyone calling a 20 year old a child before and I honestly think it is kind of hilarious, OP sounds unhinged. I'd never go to this wedding, what she is doing is wrong.", "I know right! So OP has told this women \" it was ok for me to drink when I was 20 but you are far too immature at 20 to even be in the same room as alcohol!\" You have to imagine someone saying this in the most stereotypical haughty voice you can imagine. \n\nAnd of course all of her mature and fancy 21-22 year old friends will be the very idea of class and no one will get black out drunk on free booze! But this young child would not be able to handle this responsibility! - big YTA", "That's exactly right. She can vote, join the army and even get married herself. Not only that, but she's the legal drinking age in many countries.\n\nOP doesn't have to condone underage drinking. But her friend is old enough to make the decision herself.", ">Is this a moral dilemma? Or you afraid of legal repercussions? \n\nNeither. She doesn't like Mel. She found a way to exclude her that might fly with her friends. It isn't flying.", "Have any of you people ever been to a wedding? I swear to god. I don't think I've been to a wedding where someone isn't over served.", "I turned 35 last year and this is the standard Im applying to all future events. A real sense of responsibility has come to me in the last year,  I really cannot be responsible for partying among any of those ungodly 34 year olds.", "I got skipped for champagne at a wedding once because the waitstaff (rightly) clocked me at under 21\u2026 two seats after they gave a glass to my sister, who is 2.5 years younger than me. I\u2019d been used to it for years by then but I genuinely do wonder where it is that they\u2019re carding people lol", "This 28 yo woman would like a word\u2026 You\u2019re not grown up yet. Y\u2019all will be acting like high school drama queens into your mid 20\u2019s. Also why on earth is underage drinking ok before but magically not at her wedding? I get the child free part. What I don\u2019t get is exclusion of one friend who\u2019s 1 year younger than the cut off. \n\nThis is right up there with another AITA where twins were invited but the age cut off was 18 years so one couldn\u2019t go because she was born 5 or so minutes past midnight.", "Same thoughts EXACTLY. I was like \"damn, OP is cold for not even giving her a chance to get a babysitt-- wait... the fuck??\"\n\nAnyone in their right mind would be upset in Mel's position.", "Thats because OP gaslighted you by calling it a child free wedding when she actually meant a 21 and up wedding.", "I find myself wondering how old the fiance is, and if it has anything to do with why OP is trying so hard to push the \"responsible adult\" narrative.", "Yup, my 60 year old uncle screwed up my brothers wedding by bringing mj laced brownies! One brother in law passed out on the bathroom floor. Nobody danced because they were so stoned, my dad was the worst! From my perspective it was pretty funny, but the bride, my very wonderful sil was mortified.\n\nGood thing it was over 30 years ago!", "Would bet money that Mel is competition in the looks department.", "I want to know what region they are in.  Because yeah, my first thought was either Mel is pretty enough OP is concerned about being upstaged, or Mel is a different skin color. \n\nIt feels like a weird southern thing, like OP is marrying into an \"image,\" which is the only way the weird bit about having a responsibility to prevent underage drinking would fit in right after op stopped being an underage drinker herself.\n\nObviously all supposition here, but it feels like the excuses you make when you want someone to not be there and you need to legitimise it\n\nAnd if it's not clear, op is YTA. And a bad friend\n\nWell bad ex friend, as I can't see Mel putting up with this unless she really gets something out of the social connection", "Can\u2019t buy smokes either until 21 now. But you can sign your soul to the government. Very logical indeed", "Right? I'm trying to wrap my head around the logic. If they have a private party in a house and there is alcohol, her friend could choose to drink it there. How is that any different from the wedding??? There would probably be a lot more pressure on her friend at the wedding not to drink, since everyone will be aware she's under age. Unless this friend has proven herself to be a \"gross drunk\" every time she drinks and is known to embarrass herself or others, it makes no sense. And I am someone who doesn't drink by choice! OP is TAH.", "And her middle name was \"seventeenth\"!", "But is your name \"Mel\"? Because then you're obviously just a child until then.", "You can be 18 and married but you can't have a drink when your husband fucking dies at war.", "I tried looking it up and found that it's not just the barman, but the host could be liable as well, would that include the bride and the groom, or would that be the owner of the venue? Because it sounded like it'd be the bride and the groom to me.\n\nThat wasn't only for underage drinking, though. It includes people suffering injuries or drinking too much as well, so I'm confused why one is a concern to OP, but the other isn't. If it's because OP is making sure everyone drinks responsibly, why doesn't she trust Mel to drink responsibly too?\n\nI was so ready to come with a NTA verdict because these posts tend to be about entitled parents that think their children are exceptions to the rules, but this is about a haughty young adult exercising her double standards towards her young adult friend, so underage drinking was fine when she was under 21, but now it isn't? Sure. Is this rule the actual reason Mel is being excluded, or simply an excuse to exclude her? OP, absolutely YTA.", "Wrong. Depending on the venue,  (and many, many do) contract states you (the persons renting the venue) are legally responsible for damages, and legally responsible for any underage drinking.  The venue absolutely does not want to end up in a multi million dollar lawsuit because someone under 21 gets drunk and hurts people there or driving, etc ..", "Here in the UK she's been an adult for 2 years already", "I just had a friend get married in Zion National Park, Utah. Everyone was of age, and he supplied the alcohol. It was a logistical and liability nightmare for him, the liquor had to be inventoried by staff, and if there was a tiny discrepancy all hell would have rained down upon them. An open container seen away from the venue could have ruined everything, loss of deposit, cancellation and possible serious legal ramifications, even the day before the ceremony. With the brain trust assembled, (all dear friends) it's a miracle it went off at all.", "And most of the civilised world.", "The beauty of it is that it's true in the US as well. Legally an adult at 18 but prohibited from alcohol till 21. Really makes the \"childfree\" characterization that much more insulting."]}
