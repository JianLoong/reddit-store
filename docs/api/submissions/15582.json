It's funny in the movies, but IRL no one should be proud of their behaviour here.", "By his willingness to throw out a threat about vandalism like that I think OP might be one of the crazies lmfao.  I enjoy hearing about him putting a jerk in their place, but also he has become that which he sought to destroy in the process.  ESH", "Ehhh what he said was barely a threat imo", "It\u2019s worse to threaten than to actually do it?", "Walking is good. Just park on the edge where it's always empty.", "I've been backed into and most recently had my passenger mirror ripped off in my Costco's parking lot. Good times. And it's partially why I have no interest in getting a newer car. Mine has seen it all.", "You mean a threat?", "I love parking at the far end and walking! Mostly because if I don't park in the aisle closest to the exit, I'd never find my car again.", "Only time I have been to Costco when it opened was the day before Thanksgiving and I was a madhouse.", "That sounds like a very specific circumstance that wouldn't be the norm.", "haha strategic strike is what i call it when I need to go to Ikea", "I just pull through the parking spaces. Much easier.", "Omg where was this??", "Literally everyone will hear \"do you want something to happen to your car\" as \"I'm going to do something to your car\". He doesn't need to explicitly use the word \"I\" for it to be a threat.", "I agree.", "And this is why I would always get my mother the riding cart WITH A FLAG ON IT!! I could turn around and she\u2019ll be gone in 10 seconds flat. At least the little orange flag would always give me the ability to find her.  God rest her soul I think it was a game she played to spend more time with us, and I miss her terribly. Now go hug your mothers. Or at least call.", "Ooooh, okay. I totally agree, even if the victim was in the wrong the shooter literally murdered someone, I can't think of any justifiable reason why they shouldn't have been charged.", "I agree. They justified it by saying the victim made the threat. Eye witnesses say he didn't.", "I mean, I understand why you felt that way but I\u2019m going with ESH. He was a jerk and unfortunately you sank to his level.", "ESH, i get being angry at someone being a bit rude or annoying in a parking lot (the closest thing to hell on earth) but getting into an argument where one person is antagonising you, and you respond with a threat, helps nobody and is just the wrong way to go", "ESH. Is this the new season of Beef?", "NTA.  I almost followed a guy last night because he cut the line in Dairy Queen drive-thru\u2026", "NTA. AH's should get what's coming to them", "hahaha good on you, they guy either had zero situational awareness or was being an ass on purpose. NTA", "ESH \"shame if something happened to it\" is a stereotypical threat, definitely didn't have context to excuse it as a warning\n\nThe ESH includes the person who dawdled while there were people waiting behind them, that always pisses me off", "ESH. You fought fire with fire. You were an AH too, but I would have cheered you on. I get it.", "Right? Just enjoy what we call \u201chealthy steps\u201d. So much less stress parking at the end of the Walmart and costco parking lots than trying to fight with people up front.", "That is the exact mentality of the first AH", "HOW DARE YOU CALL ME OUT FOR CHILD ENDANGERMENT \n\n*Endangers your friend\u2019s life*", "[deleted]", "This is also my strategy. It also takes a lot less time to make the walk then stalking the parking lot slowly going crazy.", "This is hilarious. Because I am thinking of traveling to a different office to meet with clients once a week, and the selling point to going to a certain office on Tuesdays was that the Costco is down the street and dead Tuesday after work. I mentioned it to someone else and she was like \u201cknown fact.\u201d", "Every grocery store is a madhouse the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas.", "They're known for bulk foods which is why, unless you need bulk quantities of food, it doesn't really make sense to shop there and will not save you any money. Especially if you don't have a lot of freezer space. \n\nAlso... Jokes. People make jokes. Even jokes you personally don't find funny and that's ok.", "I'm Canadian and I think I've seen two road rage related stabbings in the news recently (in one story the guy with the knife accidentally killed himself after starting a fight with the other driver)\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/calgary-police-altercation-death-deemed-accidental-self-inflicted-injury/wcm/6c8eeec9-5d5e-4e31-9d00-d90bce14f246/amp/\n\nDon't get into road rage fights, you loose just by participating.", "That only works if you can find two spaces at Costco. And they are back-to-back.\n\nYou want weekly weekend miracles?", "Enterprise, Alabama. I'm sure an article about it will come up on Google. Not much happens here on the regular.", "I only go to Costco during the week and at night and there's lots of parking.", "Why the hell were you sitting there for 30 minutes waiting on a spot?  You could have parked farther away and walked into the store in that amount of time.  YTA for being one of those people that just stop traffic in the parking lot to wait on a spot.", "ESH. But full disclosure\u2026 I have made exactly the same threat/suggestion when it happened to me one Christmas in a crowded shopping mall.", "I think both of you are assholes. I work at costco and it\u2019s super easy to figure out what times we\u2019re busy and what time we\u2019re not. If you wanna not deal with the insane lines and terrible parking lot situation, do not go during busy times", "YTA, and you are lucky that the person you threatened didn't have the wherewithall to start photographing you and your license plate.", "I usually tend to park at the far end of the parking lot at Costco. You're going to walk something like 5 miles though the store while you're there. Why can't you walk a few hundred feet through the parking lot?", "I really wanna know how old you are", "ESH: Both of you were acting in a manner that I wouldn\u2019t trust either of you with a motorized vehicle", "You're so right. There is no such thing as \"acting like an adult,\" just ask anyone who works in retail or food service.", "100%. OP blocked the aisle for ten minutes and doesn't realize he's the biggest AH in the lot.", "Bro would've been in the store faster if he'd just parked like an adult instead of blocking the aisle waiting for the one spot he felt entitled to", "It is where I live.", "My mom had that happen to her - big SUV parked next to her on the right side so she had to back out to see if anything was coming from that direction.  Backed into the right rear passenger door of a shiny new Lexus that come barreling up the lane.  Lexus had just been picked up that morning.  Mom heard the driver say they were never going to try to park anywhere but at the end of the lot again.", "You\u2019re buying groceries in a facility the size of a football stadium, go ahead and walk an extra fifty feet in the \nparking lot."]}
