{"id": 27523, "submission_id": "16quauz", "title": "AITA for demanding that my husband pays half of the takeaway food we order?", "selftext": "My husband (40M) and I (35F) have very different jobs. Basically, I make double than what he does and he argues that I should pay for takeaway food, especially because I am the wife and it is my role to cook. Therefore, if I cannot cook, then I should make up for it by paying for takeaways, since he already shares the split bill for food groceries (and rent). To give you a little bit of context, I have just taken on a new role at the start of this month, as a head of department, with 6 new members of staff and a lot of loose ends to tie from previous leadership. We both wake up at 4.30am and while he gets home at around 3.30 pm, I find myself arriving around 5.30pm on a light day. \n\nHis job involves food processing and while it is a laborious process, when he leaves his workplace, that\u2019s the end of the day for him, whereas I come home and continue working from home (including weekends) until around 9pm, when I just pass out as I am too tired. For him, home time means 90% being on his phone/laptop watching videos and playing games, making coffees and smoking his cigarettes. I am not going to lie and say he never helps \u2013 he does clean the bathroom and hoovers occasionally (once a month) and does the dishes (not without complaining though).\n\nNow it has come to the point where a few months ago, while he had one too many drinks, he told everyone at the table that he was \u2018investing all his money in my a*s\u2019. This is when I started downloading every single receipt for grocery, phone bills, rent, Uber drives, takeaways, holiday accommodations, plane tickets, etc. all paid by me. His argument is that some of those trips were things that I wanted to do or see (which is why I never reproached anything to him); however, the fishing trip that he wanted so much also came out of my own pocket and I never asked him a dime for it.\n\nLast month, as we were mostly on holiday, he only contributed with around $200 towards monthly expenses with rent, food and bills, which again, I did not complain about, as I knew that he wasn\u2019t paid for most of that month. But now, once he is working, he is refusing to give me anything that is beyond rent, bills and groceries, stating that I am the woman of the house and it is my job to do the cooking. I told him that I am spread thin these days until everything is more streamlined with everything at work, and that maybe he could cook every now and then or heat some ready-made food (microwave or oven), but he asked me what was the point of him getting married if he was going to do the cooking himself?\n\nSo, AITA for wanting the bills to be shared equally, if both of us are eating? Also, not one single time when I asked him about ordering, did he mention the fact that I would have to pay for all of it. In certain instances, he was even the one asking me to order food.\n\nEDIT: Having read the post that was shared here earlier, I noticed a few differences though. They were both going 50-50 for everything, including holidays, plane tickets, etc. I paid this summer alone around $3000 of my own money, and he didn't contribute with anything - I didn't even ask him to. Also, 90% of the clothes and shoes he has, I buy them for him, which I don't think was the situation where the wife had to max out her credit cards. I only pointed out the half split when he started keeping the money to himself, rather than contributing to shared things (only because I thought I was being taken advantage of). Whenever he has some money, he will spend it on some fishing gear (which he already has plenty of) or other gadgets. I, on the other hand, put money into a savings account which will go towards a house for us, whenever there will be enough for a deposit. I am not trying to play the victim card, but rather to understand if it should be me paying for the takeaways to compensate for the fact that I don't have time to cook.\n\nEdit #2: For those wondering why we have separate finances, it is because whenever he had access to some money, he just spent it on boilies, twisters, baits,etc. (Trust issues - red flags - I know). Also, for those wondering why I am still with him or what I get out of this marriage, it's simple - I love him. I suggested counselling, but he laughed in my face, saying I'm crazy and he doesn't need someone else to tell him what to do, when he already knows what he wants. I will suggest the 1/3-2/3 split for all shared bills though. Not sure what to do about holidays and other expenses though... I feel that he will still expect me to pay for those, so we'll need to sit down and have a long conversation about expectations.\n\nEdit#3 - and hopefully the last one. Having spoken to him, we decided that moving forward, he will pay 1/3 of everything shared and I would pay the rest, but he will have to cook around three times a week during the week (I cook during weekends anyway). As for the rest, I think he is reconsidering his views about gender roles, as I've shown him what everyone has been saying here.

If he thinks the point of marriage is to be serviced by his wife in every way then I fear that things will only get worse. You need to re-evaluate this relationship once the pressure on you has eased off and point out that marriage is a partnership and that you both need to make equal contributions to its success . That doesn't necessarily include money as it is rare for a couple to have equal incomes but it does include emotional labour, physical labour ie daily chores etc.", "NTA. \n\nBut you're wasting time asking him to pay - just stop getting him takeaway food. \n\nTime to start making life easier - buy your own ready made meals, order takeaway for yourself or eat at work, and leave him to work out his own meals.

If your financial,  physical, mental and emotional investment is more than what you get out of this relationship you might be better off without him.\n\nFrom the looks of it you are paying all the bills, with very little help from him and you are also doing all the chores at home.

Your husband on the other hand has lots of time when he gets home to MAKE DINNER. \n\nUsually I would be asking why your finances haven't been combined but considering his attitude I wouldn't trust him now.\n\nGet a House hold account just for bills.

Splitting equally 50/50 is not really equal.If you make 2 x what he does then pay 2/3 of the hh bills. \n\nYou then calculate groceries and split. If your husband doesn't want to cook split the cost. Or even better he pay and maybe that will get him cooking. the jobs of a wife were because they usually worked less than the husband and or made less money.  He is both. Perhaps even adjust a bit in rent and have cooking and cleaning be part of his \"Rent\" and adjust to 1/4 payment. Chores can be part of rent.

You are bringing the most money but don't have the same amount of time available. \n\nAs for personal expenses. If he is wanting a fishing trip he pay for it unless you are wanting to give a  gift, If you are going on vacation split into 2/3 for you and 1/3 for him. You make more. For personal bills and what not keep them separate. Savings separate although there should be a House hold savings that you both contribute to.\n\nReally when I read this I thought you were  a TA for splitting the bills 50/50 because you make 2 times more.  That is financial abuse. He is likely trying to equal things because he is paying more in rent than you are going by the ratios in pay and expenses. Even it up in ratios and work. You have no time for house work period so your contribution is money. His is money and labor in the house hold. Whether you are husband or wife. He seems to be trying to stuff his marriage in to a traditional mold. Does he expect to get home hours before you and you walk in the door and he ask whats for dinner while you are setting up and continuing to work from home? then because he didn't cook expect you to pay more for out to eat which is not healthy and really expensive.

Thank you for reporting content that you believe violates our rules and helping keep posts out of the POO by abiding by our rules.", "OP,\n\nI know that other post you are referring to, and I knew the two were different. You are providing your husband a lot more. Moreover, his wife did most of the home chores. Here, your husband expects you to do it (almost) all \"as the woman\". BTW, you may ask him why he's not doing 'the man's' job of being the breadwinner.\n\nIf you do go to a 1/3-2/3 split, then you stop financing his personal purchases (clothes, games, etc.). As for optional things (vacations, take-out/ eating out, entertainment), I suggest you use this general guideline: If it's something only he wants, then he pays for it. Likewise, if it's something only you want, then you pay for it. If it's something that you both enjoy, then you pay the 2/3 and he pays 1/3.\n\nDon't worry about dragging him to counseling, but you need to go for yourself. You are currently saying, you love a man who isn't being a partner, who unilaterally decides you should pay for/perform to his expectations - which are sexist, outdated stereotypes, who is an unproductive person in his free time, and sees you as his personal bank. Most people don't consider that a healthy relationship, but it's one you are actively choosing to have. You may find that counseling wil help YOU see yourself and him in a more clear light, better assess what you really want for yourself and whether you are actually getting it, and then make decisions about how you want to proceed in your relationship/achieving your own desires.", "NTA, but you need to realize your own worth and not let him dictate so much of this in the relationship. He is trying to \"have it all\" by getting the benefit of a non-trad wife on income as the breadwinner and still having the expectations of a trad wife on his household duties and responsibilities. This is not how the real world should work, it only works in his delusion and if you continue to allow it.\n\nLove is good and I understand that you love him and want to do all you can to make him happy and have a good life, but don't you deserve some reciprocation? Where is your good life provided by him? You are here so you are realizing there is an issue.\n\nLove is also sometimes not enough. In my former marriage I earned 3x my wife's salary. I was the breadwinner. I also took on 50/50 or more of the home chores, not counting those I could afford to hire folks to do. I paid ALL the bills and her salary went towards her expenses. She paid her own car note (her choice) and her expenses. I paid for all food and bills, including most restaurant/takeout purchases when she ate on her own or with friends. She maxed out her credit cards, defaulted on a couple of them and was cheating on me with her partner from work for years before getting caught and me filing for divorce. \n\nI loved her and provided and got little in return, but was unhappily staying with her until the full betrayal of trust was clear. She says she still loves me and when the divorce process was first starting, she didn't want to go through with it. I understand why, she, much like your husband, was enjoying both sides of the advantage. She was being supported like being in a full marriage and not holding to the exclusivity required (at least in my mind) of a marriage. \n\nBefore that was discovered though, I was living what you are living now. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. There was constant stress over the state of the house for me. If I didn't do it myself, it often didn't get done. If I did do it, then sometimes that was an issue because I was doing things with \"her stuff\" and she was getting to it. We used to live almost paycheck to paycheck with very little savings after my retirement investments. \n\nSince the divorce and despite having to refinance the house and agreeing to give monthly payments to her I now am able to save about 25% of my gross pay every month after bills. We don't always realize how many aspects of our lives are being drained by choosing a poor partner, but at some point, enough is enough. Though, admittedly, my personal experience is likely biasing my view. \n\nYour husband, assumedly, is being faithful, but trying to double dip on non-trad/trad spouse roles. You have to decide how much of that you are willing to tolerate, set firm boundaries on your limits and discover if you actually have a partner in life or just a wannabe slave owner.\n\nI hope for your happiness and peace going forward.", "You lost me \u201cI am the wife and it\u2019s my role to cook\u201d!\nSay whuut?\nAnd it\u2019s also your role to work and earn double what he does? \n\nHere\u2019s what I did: three bank accounts. His, mine, and ours. The joint account was contributed to equally to pay mortgage, insurance, utilities, household supplies and basic groceries with a set weekly limit. We also had a couple of savings accounts that we contributed equally to: vacations, household fund for repairs, purchases, etc. \n\nMy car was paid for when we got married but I paid my own maintenance and repairs for it. His vehicle payment came out of his separate account. \n\nWe had one night per week of dining out from the joint account, something modestly priced as we\u2019d usually grab Mexican or pizza one night per week. \n\nAny other expenditures from joint funds had to be agreed upon in advance. Credit cards were his, mine, ours with the understanding that neither of us put more than $200 on the joint credit card without discussing it first and it was paid from the joint account when due. \n\nOther discretionary expenses we used our own accounts. I saved money for my next car, paid for clothes, salon, gifts for him or my friends & family, and so on. He did the same. \n\nThis worked out very well for several years.\n\nMany years later we merged accounts and it was a disaster. Many fights over money, a lot of stress that we had avoided with our original system. \n\nOf course, you can tweak this as you wish. \n\nBut gtfo with that \u201cyou\u2019re the wife\u201d nonsense", "NTA, me and my partner have a decent amount of gap in our incomes, and I'm older by about 7 years, which contributes to the imbalance.
