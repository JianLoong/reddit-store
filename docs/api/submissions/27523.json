{"id": 27523, "submission_id": "16quauz", "title": "AITA for demanding that my husband pays half of the takeaway food we order?", "selftext": "My husband (40M) and I (35F) have very different jobs. Basically, I make double than what he does and he argues that I should pay for takeaway food, especially because I am the wife and it is my role to cook. Therefore, if I cannot cook, then I should make up for it by paying for takeaways, since he already shares the split bill for food groceries (and rent). To give you a little bit of context, I have just taken on a new role at the start of this month, as a head of department, with 6 new members of staff and a lot of loose ends to tie from previous leadership. We both wake up at 4.30am and while he gets home at around 3.30 pm, I find myself arriving around 5.30pm on a light day. \n\nHis job involves food processing and while it is a laborious process, when he leaves his workplace, that\u2019s the end of the day for him, whereas I come home and continue working from home (including weekends) until around 9pm, when I just pass out as I am too tired. For him, home time means 90% being on his phone/laptop watching videos and playing games, making coffees and smoking his cigarettes. I am not going to lie and say he never helps \u2013 he does clean the bathroom and hoovers occasionally (once a month) and does the dishes (not without complaining though).\n\nNow it has come to the point where a few months ago, while he had one too many drinks, he told everyone at the table that he was \u2018investing all his money in my a*s\u2019. This is when I started downloading every single receipt for grocery, phone bills, rent, Uber drives, takeaways, holiday accommodations, plane tickets, etc. all paid by me. His argument is that some of those trips were things that I wanted to do or see (which is why I never reproached anything to him); however, the fishing trip that he wanted so much also came out of my own pocket and I never asked him a dime for it.\n\nLast month, as we were mostly on holiday, he only contributed with around $200 towards monthly expenses with rent, food and bills, which again, I did not complain about, as I knew that he wasn\u2019t paid for most of that month. But now, once he is working, he is refusing to give me anything that is beyond rent, bills and groceries, stating that I am the woman of the house and it is my job to do the cooking. I told him that I am spread thin these days until everything is more streamlined with everything at work, and that maybe he could cook every now and then or heat some ready-made food (microwave or oven), but he asked me what was the point of him getting married if he was going to do the cooking himself?\n\nSo, AITA for wanting the bills to be shared equally, if both of us are eating? Also, not one single time when I asked him about ordering, did he mention the fact that I would have to pay for all of it. In certain instances, he was even the one asking me to order food.\n\nEDIT: Having read the post that was shared here earlier, I noticed a few differences though. They were both going 50-50 for everything, including holidays, plane tickets, etc. I paid this summer alone around $3000 of my own money, and he didn't contribute with anything - I didn't even ask him to. Also, 90% of the clothes and shoes he has, I buy them for him, which I don't think was the situation where the wife had to max out her credit cards. I only pointed out the half split when he started keeping the money to himself, rather than contributing to shared things (only because I thought I was being taken advantage of). Whenever he has some money, he will spend it on some fishing gear (which he already has plenty of) or other gadgets. I, on the other hand, put money into a savings account which will go towards a house for us, whenever there will be enough for a deposit. I am not trying to play the victim card, but rather to understand if it should be me paying for the takeaways to compensate for the fact that I don't have time to cook.", "created_utc": 1695551102, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16quauz/aita_for_demanding_that_my_husband_pays_half_of/", "score": 310, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not fair to expect he gets to have you deal with the old traditional roles and he doesn't.", "I\u2019m just wondering what you get out of him? I don\u2019t mean money, but what is the point here?

Bet he wouldn't be so keen on traditional gender roles then!", "NTA. He's trying a \"I am the man, I am in charge\" power play, but there is nothing about having a vagina that determines the role of household cook. He's an adult, he can prep and pay for food just as well. Better, in fact, since he has more time. \n\nHis trying to force you to pay more suggests this is all about punishing you for your new more prestigious job role, a reaction to insecurity about his own job in comparison. Don't put up with his behavior.", "NTA. \n\nYou work, pay bills, cook, clean, etc. what does he bring to the table?

Not his wife. That statement right there is saying \"I married you cus you can cook not because I love you\" lmao. Maybe I'm looking too deep into it but damn if my fiance said that to me, I'd ask him \"what the flip do you mean by that my man???\"", "You married a dinosaur so stop the take aways, change your bank info so he cant charge it , separate your finances , stop.paying for his trips and buy microwave/ oven ready meals.

Ask yourself. Where is   mutual respect and understanding in your relationship?", "NTA- Did you know he was like this before you married him? Saying your should do all the cooking, most of the cleaning, AND pay the majority of the bills is ridiculous. I think you should send him back to his mother if he wants to be treated like a dependent.", "NTA but you should set up some sort of system where you pay proportionally for everything. You\u2019re a partnership, behave like one! What I would say is, thought, he sounds like a bit of a jerk. Are you happy? That\u2019s probably the bigger question.", "NTA, however I think how y'all pay for takeout is the tip of the iceberg. At a very fundamental level, your husband does not respect you. That he would say bad things in front of others, blaming drunkenness, is disgusting. Further, when he asks why else he got married if not to have you cook for him, it reduces you to a role of servitude. You deserve better. Everyone deserves better.", "NTA. First, whatever you do, do not have children with this man.  Secondly, you are so much better than this.  Get rid of him.", "NTA. If it\u2019s your role to cook, it\u2019s his role to provide for you. You don\u2019t say whether you have children, but why are you staying with him? Wouldn\u2019t you be better off alone?", "He's a proper arsehole and a prize prick to boot, give it to him tight OP.", "ESH, leaning towards NTA: We just saw an AITA where it was sort of reversed, woman made half the husband\u2019s income and was expected to pay 50% of bills. I think the takeaway from that is same as it is here: why the hell is a married couple paying in halves and percentages? Who cares who makes more money, ya\u2019all are supposed to be partners, not competitors. Divide housework, but pool resources. Communicate. Be open. \n\nIf he can\u2019t share housework but wants your share of money, then he\u2019s the AH. \n\nGet some therapy, both of you. Why did you get married if you just wanted a roommate?", "NTA. Yikes. Just NTA.", "NTA but you have bigger problems to address than who pays for takeaway. Based on What you wrote, your husband does not appear to respect you as a person. Why are you ok with that? Suggest you have a good think around what he is bringing to the relationship and whether that\u2019s worth dealing with his poor attitude for the next however many years. You are still young. Find someone who treats you better", "Certainly NTA. that's all on him.\n\nAre you sure you want to stay with someone who, in this day and age, has such antediluvian attitudes towards the division of labour? If he thinks the point of marriage is to be serviced by his wife in every way then I fear that things will only get worse. You need to re-evaluate this relationship once the pressure on you has eased off and point out that marriage is a partnership and that you both need to make equal contributions to its success . That doesn't necessarily include money as it is rare for a couple to have equal incomes but it does include emotional labour, physical labour ie daily chores etc.", "NTA. \n\nBut you're wasting time asking him to pay - just stop getting him takeaway food. \n\nTime to start making life easier - buy your own ready made meals, order takeaway for yourself or eat at work, and leave him to work out his own meals. You can even pay someone to do your laundry so that your chores are cut to the bone. \n\nWhen he complains that \"the wife is supposed to cook\" tell him \"the husband is supposed to provide\". He needs to get his head into this century and recognise that you're partners and share financial and domestic responsibilities. \n\nHe's being such a dick and showing you how petty and disrespectful he really is.", "NTA. But again i\u2018m surprised by the massive amount of AITA posts which center around somethings smallish and not-world-ending, where my recurring thought is \u201ethis is not about _paying for takeout in this case_, but there seem to be larger relationship issues and arguing about _paying for takeout in this case_ is just a symptom\u201c. Am i the only one thinking so?", "Tell him that it's not he who is investing in a piece of ass but you. The only thing he seems to be contributing to the marriage is sex and I doubt if even that is worth the hassle of financially and physically supporting him.\n\nReevaluate what you are putting into this marriage versus what you are getting out of it. If your financial,  physical, mental and emotional investment is more than what you get out of this relationship you might be better off without him.\n\nFrom the looks of it you are paying all the bills, with very little help from him and you are also doing all the chores at home. You are anyways getting take-out because you are too busy to cook. So if you were on your own - your bills would be lesser - half the utilities and you could find a smaller place to live that is comfortable for just you. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSorry but what did I just read?  He married so he can have someone cook? What makes him so amazing that you would want to basically be his maid? I am sure you can find someone better or I am sure you would also feel better alone.", "I don\u2019t know how to pull quotes from your post but go ahead and serve him with those divorce papers and tell him you\u2019re right, there is no point in being married if he has to do the cooking. \n\nIt sounds likely that you\u2019ll pay some spousal support but that\u2019s the cost of peace. It\u2019s worth it. \n\nIf for some reason you think things can change, please do not have children with this man. Please. \n\nNTA.  I am not sure if you are splitting expenses in equitable way. If he missing time and pay from work due to lengthy vacations, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise when he is broke for a few weeks.

Move on.", "You are NTA, you are sharing cost and have been carrying him and paying for him. you pay the a larger portion of bills, pay for extras, not just for yourself, but those for him or joint. \n\nSorry but he is idiotic, he wants the life you have which you fund to a larger degree than him but still wants traditional housewife as well. In this day and age that not possible. \n\nRelationships are meant to be partnerships, him only doing the washing up, hovering or clean bathroom monthly is not a fair partnership. You are the main breadwinner with long hours, he can and does have the time to do more around the home, if he is unable to contribute more financially.\n\nHe is behaving like a child, if you don\u2019t have cook, he wants take out and you pay for. \n\nMy question, why are you still with him as he doesn\u2019t seem to care about you.

Usually people here will complain about the man making so much more and still splitting everything equally. Although I get it, you pay for trips and such, but hey, welcome to making more than your partner, what do you think men have been doing for so long now? Paying for trips and taking on more load of bills and rent because we made more. But now that's not the case all the time, and you're making more, like a lot more, and you still want 50/50. \n\nHim for thinking it's woman's job to cook and provide food, even though that logic is simply absurd because by his own logic, he should be the breadwinner and working more than you, making him just look like an idiot.
