Even if they are great and you trust them, you could both have something happen.\n\nAs for the mom, I want to say youre NTA and understand that she is probably critical and toxic. But I think that keeping this from her is just adding to the drama. Just unapologetically tell them you're dating someone and going on a trip. A big part of being independent is saying \"this is what I'm doing and your criticism is irrelevant\" you don't owe her more information than you want to give, you don't owe people anything really.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there aren't consequences, and it doesnt make mom wrong for feeling upset about being left out of the loop. A negative reaction to you having a secret boyfriend and vacation is, probably a normal reaction. You do live with her and rely on her for housing. Is this trip worth the extra drama? Are you about to move out? Are you prepared for her to go nuclear, cause thats absolutely what will happen if she finds out fromna second hand source. Idk I personally think that living at home, keeping a partner secret, and going on a secret trip is just feeding into the toxic dynamic here. \n\nI'm not saying mom is right, or she's not toxic.

I can see how a family member you live with would be taken aback to have you say you are going away for a week but refuse to even give a location.

I barely have money for fun and have to budget to ensure that my spending is in check. There\u2019s a big difference between living with your parents with a goal to save versus what I see in my area. Living in a very high cost of living area, I tend to see young adults making salaries of 60-140k driving $50-80k cars, eating out every single meal, and getting boba multiple times a day. On top of that, they are vacationing a few times a year. They complain about having no money, but spend faster than they make. It\u2019s pretty bad out here how little some people know how to adult, I\u2019ve heard someone in their mid 30s ask if they should get the square or round waffle mix for the party(she was ended up getting neither because no one responded).\n\nAgain, she\u2019s not forced to live with controlling parents.
