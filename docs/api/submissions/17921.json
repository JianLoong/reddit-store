She has unsolicited negative comments to add to about everything and this is why I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing my relationship (which is great!) with her;\n- I would absolutely love to share my trip with them. I just know she will cast a shadow to it;\n- my parents do not accept rent from me. I do pay for my food and anything that is consumed by me. My brother (M24) comes and goes as well and faces none of this. ATM he is living abroad and my parents support him;\n- I have a great job. However, I live in a country where the average monthly salary is less than 1 month rent for a 1 bedroom apartment. The only people my age I know that were able to move out are double income couples;\n- I am saving 70% of every paycheck towards buying a house. I also budget for traveling.

Even if they are great and you trust them, you could both have something happen.\n\nAs for the mom, I want to say youre NTA and understand that she is probably critical and toxic. But I think that keeping this from her is just adding to the drama. Just unapologetically tell them you're dating someone and going on a trip. A big part of being independent is saying \"this is what I'm doing and your criticism is irrelevant\" you don't owe her more information than you want to give, you don't owe people anything really.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there aren't consequences, and it doesnt make mom wrong for feeling upset about being left out of the loop. A negative reaction to you having a secret boyfriend and vacation is, probably a normal reaction. You do live with her and rely on her for housing. Is this trip worth the extra drama? Are you about to move out? Are you prepared for her to go nuclear, cause thats absolutely what will happen if she finds out fromna second hand source. Idk I personally think that living at home, keeping a partner secret, and going on a secret trip is just feeding into the toxic dynamic here. \n\nI'm not saying mom is right, or she's not toxic.

I\u2019m assuming that it is brought up because it\u2019s brought up by her parents in arguments. This is Reddit, we are given little information and are meant to make a judgement with said information. Some assumptions are obviously going to be made unless told otherwise by OP. \n\nI\u2019m a young adult, I\u2019m struggling. I don\u2019t have the option of living with my parents. I live in one of the most expensive cities in the US(close to San Francisco). I understand how shitty it is, but if OP wants more independence and not have to follow her controlling parents rules, she is free to leave. She\u2019s 28, not 8 and she has a job. I barely have money for fun and have to budget to ensure that my spending is in check. There\u2019s a big difference between living with your parents with a goal to save versus what I see in my area. Living in a very high cost of living area, I tend to see young adults making salaries of 60-140k driving $50-80k cars, eating out every single meal, and getting boba multiple times a day. On top of that, they are vacationing a few times a year. They complain about having no money, but spend faster than they make. It\u2019s pretty bad out here how little some people know how to adult, I\u2019ve heard someone in their mid 30s ask if they should get the square or round waffle mix for the party(she was ended up getting neither because no one responded).\n\nAgain, she\u2019s not forced to live with controlling parents.

The point of this is not to change your mother.   You won't, and she can't. It is to establish specific boundaries and to explain your reasons for them.  Yes, your mother will ignore them anyway, but she will have heard what they are.\n\nHave your parents agree to let everyone speak in full without interruption.  You must speak first. It can be helpful to write down what you are going to say, and to read it out loud.  State what you have stated to all of us here.  Preface it with an acknowledgment of your parents' love and support and your gratefulness for it.  \n\nLay out your complaints.  If your mother interrupts, stand up and say \"I will not interrupt you.  If you interrupt me again, the discussion is over until you agree to listen to what I have to say.\"\n\nState directly and clearly that you are a grown woman, you follow your parents' rules, but object to them being different for you than for your brother; that the reason you will no longer discuss any aspect of your personal and private life is because your mother is hypercritical about everything.\n\nYou will follow their rules for your brother while under their roof.  Your private life is none of their business.  You would like to be able to share things with them, but you won't in the face of your mother's inevitable criticism.  Regarding your upcoming travel, you have a cell phone. They don't need to know where you are or with whom.\n\nThen, let them speak without saying a word.  Do not respond to criticism or objections to what you have said.  When they have finished, however long that takes, stand up and say, \"I appreciate your willingness to sit down with me to discuss things.  I'm glad we now understand each other.\"  Then go to your room, or go out for a walk, or to see your boyfriend or a friend.  Stick to what you have said.\n\nAfterward, don't allow your mother to draw you into a discussion of your private life.  If she is persistent, ignore her or walk away.  Do the same if she starts to criticize anything.  Be as nice and respectful to both of your parents as you possibly can be.\n\nI hope some of this helps.", "Gentle YTA.
