She has unsolicited negative comments to add to about everything and this is why I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing my relationship (which is great!) with her;\n- I would absolutely love to share my trip with them. I just know she will cast a shadow to it;\n- my parents do not accept rent from me. I do pay for my food and anything that is consumed by me. My brother (M24) comes and goes as well and faces none of this. ATM he is living abroad and my parents support him;\n- I have a great job. However, I live in a country where the average monthly salary is less than 1 month rent for a 1 bedroom apartment.

But I think that keeping this from her is just adding to the drama. Just unapologetically tell them you're dating someone and going on a trip. A big part of being independent is saying \"this is what I'm doing and your criticism is irrelevant\" you don't owe her more information than you want to give, you don't owe people anything really.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there aren't consequences, and it doesnt make mom wrong for feeling upset about being left out of the loop. A negative reaction to you having a secret boyfriend and vacation is, probably a normal reaction. You do live with her and rely on her for housing. Is this trip worth the extra drama? Are you about to move out? Are you prepared for her to go nuclear, cause thats absolutely what will happen if she finds out fromna second hand source. Idk I personally think that living at home, keeping a partner secret, and going on a secret trip is just feeding into the toxic dynamic here. \n\nI'm not saying mom is right, or she's not toxic.

Living in a very high cost of living area, I tend to see young adults making salaries of 60-140k driving $50-80k cars, eating out every single meal, and getting boba multiple times a day. On top of that, they are vacationing a few times a year. They complain about having no money, but spend faster than they make.

Don't think I agree with you on that one.\n\nI get that OP is living rent free in their parents house which is very generous and OP should look at ways of paying it back somehow but that doesn't mean their parents get to be AH to them.\n\nWe are missing a fair amount of info here but going off what we got, OP is NTA.", "Honestly, even when they don\u2019t live at home I would like my kids to let me know when they are going away for a week. \n\nSimilarly, when our kids are out of the house we will still let them know if we are going on vacation.", "I wouldn't say she's TA but you are right on all other accounts.", "> as a 28 y/o living at home, you should be paying them rent or contributing financially \n\nThis is really culturally dependent. There are plenty of counties where this would be a bizarre expectation and I am pretty sure OP lives in one of them. Even in my country (USA) where this expectation is normal lots of people are from cultural groups (like mine) where it would be just weird for parents to expect, and certainly not an AH move to not pay rent to your own parents", "do we have the same mom? Mine has the little calendar too. but it doesn't bother me, because I know she is just asking because she loves us & may not remember in her head when we are going away. It doesn't have anything to do with how much money we are spending.", "OP has mentioned that she tried to pay rent but her parents refused to accept it. She also mentions that they have something bad to say about almost every decision she makes.\n\nNTA", "My family does the same.\n\nDon\u2019t have to share every detail, but we know what country and dates of travel so should anything happen, we know how to help and/or set expectations for how quickly we can get home.\n\nWe also agree on a schedule to text what are essentially proof of life messages - here\u2019s a picture or story about something cool that happened. It\u2019s because my family cares and it also helps my mom not to worry so much. \n\nI think it\u2019s a general courtesy to agree on what info would make all of us adults feel comfortable and to be grateful that we have a loving, caring family.", "Also, people who have normal parents don't understand this. They also don't understand that we'd love to have the kind of parents we could share this info with, but sadly, we don't. \n\nThe way we learned this lesson was all the times we actually did trust they were normal parents and we paid the price, again and again. After awhile, we realized we just couldn't trust them. If they were a friend who treated us like that, we'd end the friendship. Because they're our parents, we have to figure out how to maintain the relationship while also maintaining our mental health. That means time away from them, and what's referred to as an \"information diet.\"", "Think your also missing one of the points here. She's not carelessly freeloading off of her parents. She came home as an escape from a bad relationship. I did the same thing at 26 when my (ex) husband abused me. I didn't pay rent either, borrowed my mom's truck for free to job search, and moved out after no more than 4 months once I had enough money for a down payment for a new car and and steady income to rent with a friend.\n\nNot every 20-40 something living with their parents is an overgrown child who doesn't know how to take care of themselves. Especially if they were out of the house and had to move back in due to some shitty circumstances.", "I'm wondering if she has gotten into significant trouble or hurt herself. It's possible the mom is overprotective now. The way she said some things remind me of some other people I've known who don't have great decision making skills.", ">I can see her parents being annoyed if she has money to go on vacation, but doesn\u2019t have money to help pay rent.\n\nOP says her parents won't let her help with the rent, just to clarify.", "I kinda get why depending on how her mom is... My MIL absolutely freaks out whenever we travel. When we were on our honeymoon, it was a 7 day cruise. She called the ship daily demanding contact. The ship ignored the crazy so we got to relax, but it about sums up exactly how she acts when she can't contact my husband for a single day.", "This reminds me of the song \"Suds in the Bucket\" lol. The ladies gossiping at the beauty shop in a small town won't matter in 10-20 years. She was probably brought up to worry about what everyone thinks but that's just not how most of us are now. If you're not consistently needing them to bail you out of terrible situations then they need to learn how to just be happy for your accomplishments and stop worrying just about your mistakes.", "If I may ask, and I don't mean this in a judgemental way.  But you say its a small town and, with me also being from a small town, I can't help but wonder if this is an interracial relationship (or like.. another woman)? I ask because I know small towns, especially south, are very racist (and homophobic) and the average person gives interracial relationships bad looks and tend to talk. (I dealt with this issue before).\n(You don't have to answer that if you don't want to, I'll respect your privacy)\nNow for my opinion, NTA. its your life, you live the way you want. Yes inform them where you're going for no other reason than safety. Other than that, your life is yours to live and your happiness is what matters! Do what makes you happy!", "What are these other decisions of yours that don\u2019t align with how she thinks?  These are important details.", "What does this mean?", "And when you don't get an answer after a few hours or days? This is like an episode from the ID Channel", "Crazy you\u2019re getting downvoted. I only had a roommate for 2 years in college but I never asked where they were going and for how long, nor did I give two shits.", "No.  I\u2019m not saying the parents are free to do it.  I\u2019m saying if she doesn\u2019t like it, then she should leave.  I feel similarly when people borrow money from their parents and then get upset when the parents are concerned or comment regarding how the money is being spent.  This is essentially the same thing since OP isn\u2019t paying rent.", "Especially if my kid just got out of a bad relationship that left them on my doorstep. I'd probably be worried that they're going away with the Ex more than I would assume it's someone new.", "I haven't lived with my parents for almost a decade now, and I *still* drop my dad a text to let him know I'm on the way to/coming back from somewhere. Even if it's just to update him that I won't be needing an invite to dinner for that period. I'm genuinely trying to think of a situation in which a 28yo is more than happy to live at their family home, but absolutely adamant they won't say where they're going, it's baffling.", "Did you go on vacations during that time?", "It\u2019s an heterosexual relationship between two white people. With small town I mean a village in an European island. So extremely small. \n\nMy parents both have prominent jobs and are known members of the community. Me being seen with more than one guy throughout life looks bad for them. This is how my mother sees it.", "I've lived in deep south Texas towns for 25 years. There are lots of interracial relationships. No one cares.  Maybe they cared decades ago.", "That I agree with outrageously penguin, whom I replied to. AKA \"perfect answer\" \"bingo\" \"hit the nail on the head\". Must have lost something in the translation I guess.", "Well that never happened. Not sure why I'm being down voted for not telling my roommates my every move in a small town in the middle of Amish country. Odds are one of them likely told her parents where she was as she was that close to her mother.", "and that would prob be a good guess as to why OP prefers to be silent possibly??", "My Kids do the same, as in letting us know when they are traveling, returning, destination.  To me it's just common sense in this crazy world we currently live in, and just simple respect.  We do the same when we travel, etc.  I'm guessing OP may be feeling entitled........getting the housing, etc. for free, but expecting no obligations in return. It's not even that they're being asked to perform chores, etc. but to divulge what I would consider normal info to someone I'm living with rent-free.  Where are you going, and with who?  When do you leave, return.  It's not that hard!", "Maybe she didn't originally mention the rent situation because it has nothing to do with the issue at hand?", "> some assumptions are obviously going to be made unless told otherwise by OP. \n\nThis is one of the worst statements I\u2019ve ever read on Reddit. Assumptions will *always* be made, whether or not the information proving or disproving said assumption is given. So many times, I\u2019ve seen comments asking the OP for info, they give it, and are immediately called a liar, saying that they\u2019re twisting the story to make them look good. In many cases, that is what happens, but it isn\u2019t every single one. \n\nIn this case, whether or not OP contributes to shared bills isn\u2019t necessary information. She asked if she was TA for not sharing travel plans with her parents, whom she is uncomfortable sharing that information with, and she\u2019s not. If her mom were casually asking just to talk about it, OP would still be within her right to maintain her stance to privacy, but icing her mom out would fall into AH territory. Grilling your child and pretending it\u2019s in the name of love and safety is not good. It is really, really controlling and manipulative. If OP or her partner are paying for the trip, the only courtesy her parents have a right to is informing them she\u2019ll be on vacation and for how long she\u2019s going to be gone.", "Someone makes sense. Also she is 28 with s track record of shit relationships. Maybe her mom is right. She make shit life choices.", "I did actually. Drove from Vegas (home) to Cali for a weekend racing event that April, about a month before I moved out to live with my best friend.\n\nThough my mom knew where I was going and I video chatted with her while watching our Friday night show since I was going to miss it. So not the same circumstances as OP.", "Ahh, gotcha. Maybe its a cultural difference, i assumed you were in america. Sorry for assuming lol. I can't wrap my head around that outlook. I wish the best for ya though! And do have a lot of fun on your trip! :)", "i was gonna say you should like you live in spain or greece lol", "NAH - Especially from this addition. Y'all are doing your best, and y'all are in positions of high pressure. I'm sure they trust you, but it sounds like they could face social repercussions that could turn into professional repercussions from the actions of those you associate with. It's an unfortunate part of living in a small isolated community. People talk, and people weaponize gossip. I hope y'all can be gentle and kind amongst the silly social stresses y'all are under", "Man, my town was really bad. Woman who dated black men were called... I think... mudshark? I can't remember the term off hand. It was mostly older folks that were like that but many (mostly rednecks) my age were really bad to.. it was upsetting, glad to have gotten away from it.", "I didn't downvote you. I just responded to your comment. After watching the horrors that can happen in a Pennsylvania Amish town on dateline, I definitely don't put anything pass anyone.", "Op made an edit to give more insight into her decision.", "She mentioned she didn\u2019t pay rent since the beginning, it was kind of randomly put in the post.", "NTA, because it's none of their business, but", "Well not necessarily you down voting me just in general. Now I don't agree with telling your roommates your coming and goings considering your an adult and pay rent. I don't even report my coming and goings to my family when I moved out of state but I would think your parents are more likely to be in the loop on where your going then roommates. Especially if there is a close bond with the parents. The only time I've told anyone what I was doing or who I was with was a friend when I was meeting a guy I met online.", "My bad, let me rephrase it: maybe she didn't mention her parents told her not to pay rent because it has nothing to do with the situation?", "I'm a single mom so I tell my baby sitter all the deets plus she's a friend. She knows if I'm late and don't call somethings up.", "Well when someone is watching your kid yeah that's logical but did you do the same before you were a mom?", "Yep. I would text my bestie or sister. If I was meeting someone new, I would snap their pic and license plate and send that as well. Sometimes, I would send all the info I had, including screenames. I've also been watching true crime shows for at least 25 years lol", "Wow ok. License plate? Never heard that one before lol. Maybe I'm the strange one my family never respected boundaries and would show up or quadruple check to see if I was lying about where i was which I never was lying or did anything for them to think like that about me. So due to that I don't trust people with where I'm going or what I'm doing it's simply a none of your business I'm wondering if OP has had a similar relationship with their family and that's why they don't want to tell them."]}
