{"id": 14123, "submission_id": "12dhfra", "title": "AITA for going to work while my wife was having her appendix out?", "selftext": "My (31m) wife (32f) was having a ton of really bad abdominal pain last weekend. I drove her to urgent care Saturday morning--she didn't want to go but I basically made her. Urgent care made her go to the ER where they determined that her appendix needed to come out that day.\n\nShe called her mom before surgery. Her mom must have told both of my parents as well because all three (her mom and my mom and dad) ended up at the hospital to be with her during her surgery.\n\nNow; here's where the conflict lies...I was scheduled for work at 5pm that night. I've just started a new job that pays well.  I only started it a couple of weeks ago so I am brand new at it. I didn't want to call in. They probably would have been cool with it given the circumstances but I still didn't want to do it. I didn't even have the PTO for it; I would have either had to take the day unpaid or gone negative on my PTO. So, while my wife was having the surgery I went into work and pulled my shift.\n\nMy wife is upset with me. She is accusing me of \"abandoning\" her. But I think that is unfair. She was having a completely routine surgery and she had plenty of company and support. It was unfortunate that I couldn't be there and I feel bad about it but it's not as if I'm a surgeon and could have made a difference. I had to work, period, and I'm too new there to call in. The timing sucked but my wife's health outcomes were the same either way.\n\nHer mother gets it and so does my father. But my mom thinks I should have called in.

It was important to her that you be there. That\u2019s your wife having surgery, man. You *could* have taken off work - all but the absolute worst workplaces would understand \u201cmy wife is having an urgent surgery\u201d - but you prioritized your job over your wife.", "Info - what communication was there with your wife about this? Did you tell her how you couldnt be there?", "NAH - maybe not the choice I\u2019d have made but you were in a tough spot with the new job. Also, you didn\u2019t abandon your wife - you made her go to the hospital when she was refusing to seek that kind of medical attention, if anything you potentially saved her. You also knew she has adequate support around her, she wasn\u2019t alone.", "NAH. You made sure she did have support, and I'm hoping your job would have allowed you to keep your phone on at all times in case an emergency did arise.\n\nBut she is entitled being upset that you were not there during a very scary situation.", "YTA People can die during appendix surgery. There can be  so many complications. How would you have felt if she died and you were at work?", "NAH.\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult situation all round. New job stress, fear over surgery etc. However wife wasn\u2019t abandoned, both sets of parents were there. In event of an emergency, they could have called him. Doesn\u2019t make her fears any less valid though. OP did right thing by taking her to hospital and being there before and after.", "Oh this is a hard one as I see both y'all's points. She was probably scared and just wanted comfort from her partner but you have a good point to regarding the brand new job and PTO.  NAH and hopefully she'll get passed it in a little while.", "NAH.  As long as her parents were there and you were there before and after it is not a big deal to me.  I mean you just started the job and would like to keep it.  You couldn\u2019t do anything for your wife and she wasn\u2019t alone so, i think it is fine", "[deleted]", "NTA. You actually MADE her to get medical help before things get awful, so you got away with routine appendectomy instead of massive peritonitis. So, you brought her to urgent care and then to ER and was with her until you had to go to your shift leaving her with caring family. It's hard to say if you'd lose your job or would get bad appearance with this short notice, but you definitely thought about your nuclear family with her when tried hard to keep it. You would definitely come back to the hospital asap if anything goes wrong. I don't see from original post if she asked you to stay with her.", "NTA\n\nMy dad missed a few births due to working, shit happens, everybody is ok , move along.", "This is a tough one bc I get it. \n\nObviously, you would want to be there for your wife in a crazy and difficult time. Through the corporate america bullshit, it makes people extremely paranoid to think of asking. \n\nUsually the first 90 days, you are on a provisionary period and small things can be a cause for termination. My last job fired a guy bc he was in a car accident shortly after hiring. He had a broken limb. He could have still did most of the job responsibilities but he would need some accommodations while he healed. They thought it was better if they didn't waste their time.\n\nFriend/coworker almost missed the birth of his first child bc he had just been hired on. He had worked as a contractor at this job prior to being hired full-time. He had an established relationship with his managers and still needed to be told that he wasn't going to lose his job if he decided to go. He still came tried to come in the next day and the manager had to send him back home.\n\nEdit: NAH for judgement", "NAH. Of course she wanted you there! But you just started the new job and don't want to ruffle feathers. I can appreciate both sides. You definitely could've tried but I can see why you didn't.", "YTA\n\n\"They probably would have been cool with it given the circumstances but I still didn't want to do it.\"\n\nThe fact that you didn't even bother *trying* to contact your work to discuss the situation for their input is repulsive. There's plenty of options that your boss could've possibly offered you in that situation, but you'll never know because you didn't buckle down as an adult to communicate with them. The timing *absolutely* sucked, and you know, people might have actually understood that and worked with you, had you tried.\n\nThere are *significantly* worse things in life than unpaid leave or negative PTO. One that immediately comes to mind is making sure your wife understands that unpaid leave and negative PTO outrank her need to have you there with her.\n\nI'm not sure how familiar you actually are with medical procedures, but as others have said, no surgery is routine. You *really* don't want to learn to not take things for granted on something like that the hard way.\n\nEdit - thank you for the awards, greatly appreciated!", "I think everyone here has valid arguments and it was just a bad situation. Fortunately it was a routine surgery and she came out ok. Congrats on the new job and all. I think the best thing here is to not try and decide who was right. Emphasize that it was a rough situation and you thought you were making a right call. Come to terms with future situations. Above all else, please leave your family out of it. Lol", "NTA. I'm amazed at the YTA's here. We know there are bad workplaces and bad bosses. He could be at one. He also is new and it could reflect badly on him to call out so soon-not saying it's right at all, but it happens. They also may be struggling for money. Lastly, she had his parents and hers with her. She had a support system.", "Nah. Depending on your job that could massively effect your work atmosphere, interferes with finances, and it makes sense. \n\nI understand why your wife it upset, but you didn\u2019t abandon her, she wasn\u2019t alone she has support. It wasn\u2019t life threatening, and hopefully u can be making it up by taking good care of her now that she\u2019s out.", "NTA\n\nYou went to work not out drinking with your buddy. There was literally nothing for you to do until your wife was out of surgery. There\u2019s no difference between sitting in a waiting room, going to grab a coffee or being at work. If something went sideways the hospital staff was not coming to get you to help solve the problem. She had support with her in the hospital & they knew how to reach you. Hopefully you returned after your shift & are helping her during recovery.", "NTA.. you're at a new job, you shouldn't call in sick. \nshe was hardly alone!", "So I\u2019m going to be in the minority here Nta. Not because I would have done the same but rather because when I had mine taken out I had a great time. Honestly still think it was funny as shit.", "YTA. Did you have a conversation about it before she went into surgery? Did you ask her if she wanted you there? Because if she said yes, she wanted you there, and you said sorry I have to work, man that\u2019s cold. People don\u2019t go to their family\u2019s hospital beds because they can affect the health outcome. You go to support the person you love.", "NTA\n\nSeriously people, what could OP have done?\n\nOP's wife was *at a hospital under anesthetic* and away from OP who could be contacted by phone. \n\nEven if OP had stayed at the hospital, he wouldn't have been much use there. He was better off going to his work, telling them that he might need to leave even though the situation was (mostly) under control.\n\nPlus she had three other people at the hospital.", "NTA. There were three other people there and you had to work.", "Gonna go against the grain, NAH \n\nYeah you could have stayed, it is *surgery* but you had very valid reasons to need to go to work. \n\nAlso, as surgeries go, appendix surgery is pretty damn routine.\n\nShe can be upset that you went, she\u2019s not an AH for that, but you\u2019re not an AH for having your reasons to go. Especially in this economy, a job is pretty damn important.", "NTA you couldn't help her during the op and after the op there were 3 people to treat her. I by myself went through two surgeries during COVID and noone was allowed in hospital. And I would be completely pissed if my husband not mentally prepared to handle me being hurt etc sitting next to my bed the whole time while I try to get my thoughts together after anaesthesia. I got both my parents at my bed after a teeth surgery when I was 16 and I don't want anybody around in this time.\nI guess you visited her after work and slept at home? Or were you required to stay in hospital for days?", "NTA. You got her to the doctor, she was sent to the hospital and had 3 people with her. Some people do not get that some companies can and will fire you during the probationary period for anything, including an absence,  especially since you've only been there a couple of weeks. I understand she was nervous but she needs to understand you just started this job. Well paying jobs can be hard to find these days, depending on where you live. I'm sure you wanted to be there too and everyone here is acting like you are some heartless monster for wanting to keep a brand new job and paycheck. It's a risk you weren't willing to take and I don't blame you.", "Going against the grain and saying NTA. I just had surgery a few weeks ago and my husband wasn\u2019t anywhere near it. My mom brought me. He was at home taking care of our kids and getting ready for me coming home. Sometimes life happens, and it\u2019s not worth risking a new, well-paying job for a routine procedure where she has 3 people there supporting her.", "NTA- I would have told my other half to go into work as it\u2019s a new job. She had enough support from the parents.", "NTA, I mean people are ripping you apart here but she wasn't alone. Her family was there. You really don't need the entire clan to have a family reunion at the hospital for a surgery like that.", "NAH. Your wife wants you there; that's valid. You were making sure you were maintaining a job that would allow to cover the hospital bills and her comfort at home. Also valid.", "In the UK now mostly they won't let anyone at the hospital anyway so last time my partner had surgery  I had to be at home so I WFH that day and waited for the call to say I could go see them.  All this who was or was not in the waiting room is a bit pre COVID now here.  Sorry to say so in my opinion NTA.  If there was an emergency the hospital would have  called", "INFO: You say she had \u201cplenty of company and support;\u201d who was with her? Were they able to medically advocate for her should the need have arisen?", "Gonna say NTA. \n\nShe had her appendix taken out, not her heart.", "NTA\n\nI'm going to surprise myself and say it, even though I'd probably be beating myself up in this situation.\n\nWe don't know enough about OP's work situation or industry to say 'just call in', especially if he's not out of any probationary periods. I lost a job two weeks in because I was injured in an accident and couldn't work.....a lot of employers just won't care.\n\nIn a perfect world, OP would know that he could be there with his wife and face no repercussions, but that's not the case that the majority of us face. Maybe he could have told his boss the situation and been allowed to leave, but that's not a guarantee, even if you're settled into the job. \n\nI also get how she feels....honestly I just feel for you both, it sucks you have to be in that situation.", ">\tI had to work, period, and I\u2019m too new there to call in. \u2026 I would have either had to take the day unpaid or gone negative on my PTO\n\nThis is what makes it NAH for me. I\u2019m sure everyone here could\u2019ve been nicer with their words, but you have responsibilities you can\u2019t ignore. If you get fired, that hurts your wife worse than only having other family by her side.", "NTA appendix removal is a little intervention not a surgery, at 30 yo there is no reason to have the entire family there at all, its childish", "NAH - if she knew you planned on going in she could have used her words and expressed she wanted you to stay. She had plenty of support and you thought you were doing the right thing to protect your financial future. Her feelings are valid but so are yours.", "NAH.  I personally would have made a different choice than the OP, but he didn\u2019t really screw the pooch.  Unless his new high paying job is as an ER surgeon or anesthesiologist, his presence impacts nothing. She had several people there at the hospital, and if there were complications, I\u2019m going to assume the OP would immediately come to the hospital.", "NTA. Your status at work is for the benefit of your wife as well, and you left her with three trusted people, not alone.", "NTA. You didn't leave your wife alone. She had people there to support her. Considering how easily you can be let go when still on 'probation' it's perfectly viable to not to want to call in. He only started a couple of weeks ago.", "I\u2019m amazing at how many YTAd you\u2019re getting. NTA here. Routine surgery and she had plenty of family support. You were the one that got her there and advocated she go in the first place.", "NTA - I had mine out when I was 16.       \nI told my parents to go home.         \nUnless you\u2019re a doctor you don\u2019t need to be there for a simple operation.          \nYou didn\u2019t leave her alone, she had support.        \nHow would it make everything better if you lost your job ?          \nGo to work whilst she\u2019s in surgery that way if she\u2019s in a bad way after it you are more likely to be able to stay with her.", "1. Did your wife thank you for trusting your gut and taking her to the emergency room when she initially did not want to go? If not, she seems a bit ungrateful. \n2. Marriage can (and DO) fall apart due to bad finances. Your job versus her health in your marriage is therefore both big things to consider. \n3. If you were maximum a 30min drive away from the hospital you are good. If anything changed for the worse one of the parentals would have called and you would have gone to the hospital.", "NTA. She had coverage. It's not like you didn't have a cell phone.", "Nta she was IN SURGERY AND THEREFORE UNCONSCIOUS THE WHOLE TIME! And both of her parents and yours were all there. Your job may and I stress may have been understanding because you literally don\u2019t know for sure but as a brand new employee it still wouldn\u2019t have looked good.", "I know everyone here is saying YTA, but, I\u2019ve been through this exact scenario so I\u2019m on the fence, but leaning towards NTA. I had to have a pretty major surgery and my husband was unable to get time off. He was fairly new at the job and didn\u2019t have any PTO. He couldn\u2019t even take time off while I was in recovery. It sucked to not have my husband there for me, and especially while I was recovering at home when I needed it most, but I understood that he couldn\u2019t get the time off. I at least had my mom at the hospital with me. My husband was there for me when he was home, and helped me with whatever I needed or wanted. That\u2019s all that mattered to me. With food delivery apps so prevalent now, I was able to have food delivered whenever I needed it, and my mom came by a few times to check on me. It\u2019s really tough but we can\u2019t always get time off when we need it, so we must be flexible and understanding. In fact, I have to have another surgery next week and my husband isn\u2019t able to go, but I\u2019m not holding it against him.", "Because it was a recently new job and the fact that she had both her parents and his there with her (who could\u2019ve informed him of any emergencies so he could rush over), I\u2019m going to go with NTA. I have had this happen to me and unless it was really important for her to have him there for her own emotional support, perhaps she could have expressed that to him and come up with a solution together, like go in to work and tell your boss that your wife is having surgery. I think it would have made a difference coming in as opposed to calling out.", "I'm guessing unpopular opinion but NTA. I've had a handful of surgeries and would never require anyone to be at the hospital while I was asleep and unaware to be waiting there for literally no reason. It seems entirely pointless other than a weird symbol of loyalty? My partner has worked during my surgeries and also while I was hospitalized with pancreatitis. Life goes on, her surgery was not dependent on whether you were there, and I'm sure you were there later on? You know, during the important awake times. And made her even go to get care. I hate the way we focus on empty gestures instead of real care.", "NTA. A grown woman acting like a little child. When did it stop being mandatory for adults to act like adults even when times are hard? It's insulting.\n\nPeople die while crossing the road as well, does she need you to walk her every day because streets are scary?", "Eh, NTA?  Everyone freaking out  \u201cit\u2019s surgery!\u201d So?  lol it\u2019s a basic surgery.  If half my family was there and my partner had a new job to go to it would not bother me in the slightest.  I would have told him to work I\u2019ll be fine!  I really doubt OP being there would have really made any difference other than give him anxiety about missing work at a new job.", "YTA\nI understand it was a tough call as you don\u2019t want to jeopardize your job in any way, but understand that no surgery is \u201croutine\u201d. And if something went bad and a difficult decision needed to be made, that would fall to you as the husband. Her mom would not have legally been able to make that decision, and your parents definitely could not have. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve had this struggle with my husband for 17 years. He\u2019s always put work over family. Now our kids are grown/mostly grown and he\u2019s just starting to realize how little all that meant when looking at how much he missed. He feels tremendous guilt over not properly being there for me when family died, missing things with the kids, etc. And this is his issue, but the kids and I. At the end of your life, do you want to look back and go, \u201coh I worked a great job for X years\u201d or \u201cI was always there when my family needed me?\u201d", "NTA - you being there would have zero impact on the surgery. I understand not wanting to take time off to soon after starting a job. She will be home after 24-48hrs and can help her recover.", "NTA\n\nYou're new to the job and want to get a good start.  It was a routine procedure and she had support.", "NTA.", "NTA. People will rip you a new one here, but your wife wasn't alone and looks like surgery went fine. I understand that you didn't want to call in.", "Eh.. I\u2019m gonna go soft NTA ~ I personally would have told my husband to get his but to work. She wasn\u2019t alone, and a new high paying job is not something I would risk so he could hold my hand. \n\nHowever, your wife clearly feels differently and her feelings are valid. You need to find a way to make it up to her and make sure she knows how much you value her.", "NTA . I just had a similar surgery . I was perfectly fine with a friend there and a friend to pick me up. I knew I was going into a long recovery and I would need as much help as possible, I wouldn\u2019t want my partner or friend to mess up their new job to have extra worried person around me ; friends and family can\u2019t even get into the surgery ward they need to wait outside . Your gf is being ridiculous, entitled and is acting like a child, as if she won\u2019t need financial support for the recovery. She had 3 whole people there ?! For an appendix ?! LOL", "An emergency appendectomy is not routine surgery", "NTA\n\nShe had the best care in the hospital and you had no PTO to use. Until very recently in my country you couldn't have anyone even visit you or go into the emergency room with you due to COVID.", "Soft YTA. \nShe wanted you there at a scary time.\n\nYou want to make money to support your family and it sounds like you found a great job that can do that and you don't want to lose it. They would have understood you calling out. But I also see why you didn't. \n\nI didn't grow up with financial security and my husband and I finally are in a place where we feel safe and comfortable. Being scared to lose that security makes you do things you normally wouldn't do.", "NTA, she had family there with her so you didn\u2019t leave her alone. I understand her wanting you there, but your new job is presumably important for both of you, especially if she\u2019s gonna be out of work while she recovers.", "ESH/Neither. you took her there in the first place and you were there in the beginning- you had to leave and thats ok but shes allowed to be upset by that, honestly i would just talk to her and explain you didnt want to lose the job & make you both struggle, especially if you had to pay for that medical care", "NTA\n\nIf you're in the probationary period of a new job it can be dicey to take time off.  And your wife had people around her.  It sucks but you are not TA here.", "NTA. It\u2019s not open heart surgery. And I\u2019m sure he could have left in an emergency.", "NTA - there is nothing you can do whilst someone is in the operating theatre, to be honest if your wife is going to theatre from the ER all visitors are doing is getting in the way whilst she is prepped for theatre. \nYou did the right thing going to work, ensuring your job and income are maintained. \nThe time to take time off is when she comes home and needs rest and help post surgery.\nAs long as the hospital could contact you and have you return in a reasonable time, I would have advised you to go to work.", "I\u2019m leaning toward NAH since she did have support while you were at work. You did just start this job and while you had a valid understandable reason to call in, you had no way of knowing how receptive your job would have been. If you\u2019ve only been there a few weeks you are still in the \u201cprobationary\u201d period. The only AH here is the American work culture (assuming you\u2019re in the US)", "NTA\n\nSave that time with a new job to be with her at home after the surgery. She wasn't alone. She had her mom and your parents. That is plenty of support.", "I'm going to ruffle some feathers here, but...\n\nYour wife had a whole community of support around her. One person shouldn't make or break that.\n\nAnd if she's in the hospital, who's paying the bills? Not her; she's understandably down for a while. You? Not if you call off. Hell, many places nowadays don't even NEED a reason to fire you, they can do it because a supervisor has a bad mood on a particular morning.\n\nYou gave the rest of her support tribe a chance to be there for her while you did the fiscally responsible thing in providing a roof over her recovering head.\n\nNTA.", "Nah, it's just appendicitis and the safest operation in the world, with other family there.  \n\nI sent my wife away when I was in hospital with the same thing. She was uncomfortable, being overly attentive because she was bored (my pillow can only be fluffed so many times) and I was so high on pain meds I couldn't converse. It was miserable for her for no reason.", "NTA - there is precious little you can do while she is being prepped for surgery, in surgery and in recovery. As next of kin, you need to be contactable in case of emergency so as long as had phone on etc. I say this as someone who has had five operations, including one at 15 and two at 18/19 and in each case, I got dropped off at hospital and then parents/partner went to work. The days after surgery are when you need to be there for her. Especially with any heavy lifting. \n\nThat said, I do not work when my pets are in operation but that's because my focus is completely blown but I have the luxury of European paid leave.  I have worked when they were under but try not to since having to go straight into a meeting after telling vet not to wake her up. But we knew that was high-risk surgery.", "NTA. Your wife was not going into life or death surgery. It's a routine procedure, she had loved ones with her. She's not a child. I really don't get her attitude to be honest. I can understand her being disappointed, but not angry.", "NTA - my son had lots of medical issues and surgeries. There were many times my husband had to go to work while I stayed with him. This includes exploratory surgeries where we didn\u2019t know the outcome. You have to keep your job to support your family. Emotionally she may have needed you but sometimes we just have to be strong and pray.", "NTA. I can appreciate your wife's POV, but life is expensive. What if there are bills from this unexpected surgery? I agree working made the most sense. She had a support system. If it is a higher risk surgery or more serious, I would say TA. Maybe it's because I work in the medical field, but I don't see this as a huge deal.", "It\u2019s hard to say.\n\nSurgery is scary. I know you\u2019re just sitting in the waiting room, but, it\u2019s the wife knowing that you\u2019re close by if something happens. Its comforting to know that your other half is in the next room if anything was to happen. It\u2019s knowing they\u2019ll be there waiting for you when you\u2019re done. It all comes down to \u201cbeing there when it\u2019s important\u201d and personally, I think I\u2019d be a little upset if my husband chose to go into work. \n\nHowever, I do understand the husbands POV. It\u2019s a new job, we feel like it\u2019s \u201cthe worst thing in the world\u201d and the \u201cjob will treat me poorly/think I\u2019m unreliable\u201d now that I\u2019ve called in so soon. But that\u2019s such a skewed way of thinking\u2014 but I 100% get it. \n\nYour wife will probably lose faith that you\u2019ll be there for her during \u201cemergencies\u201d for a bit going forward. I know OP had valid reasons to not be there, but I know I would lose a chunk of \u201ctrust\u201d in my husband for a bit, but nothing that couldn\u2019t be fixed if that makes sense. \n\nNgl this is a hard one.", "NTA - considering the surgery was for the removal of an appendix, and you had family in the hospital and the situation with your new job at a time of recession, where every pay check counts .\n\nIf it was any other surgery that needed transfusions, things could go wrong and you would be needed to give consent . But not this one , I don\u2019t think you actually thought about that part at all and for that I feel you should apologize.", "YTA, it's surgery, she is probably scared and would like some support from her husband and your presence.

I drove her to urgent care Saturday morning--she didn't want to go but I basically made her. Urgent care made her go to the ER where they determined that her appendix needed to come out that day.\n\nShe called her mom before surgery. Her mom must have told both of my parents as well because all three (her mom and my mom and dad) ended up at the hospital to be with her during her surgery.\n\nNow; here's where the conflict lies...I was scheduled for work at 5pm that night. I've just started a new job that pays well.  I only started it a couple of weeks ago so I am brand new at it. I didn't want to call in. They probably would have been cool with it given the circumstances but I still didn't want to do it. I didn't even have the PTO for it; I would have either had to take the day unpaid or gone negative on my PTO. So, while my wife was having the surgery I went into work and pulled my shift.\n\nMy wife is upset with me. She is accusing me of \"abandoning\" her. But I think that is unfair. She was having a completely routine surgery and she had plenty of company and support. It was unfortunate that I couldn't be there and I feel bad about it but it's not as if I'm a surgeon and could have made a difference. I had to work, period, and I'm too new there to call in. The timing sucked but my wife's health outcomes were the same either way.\n\nHer mother gets it and so does my father. But my mom thinks I should have called in.

Maybe OP was still struggling with the decision until she was in surgery and there was nothing to tell yet before that point. I'm not sure how long that kind of procedure takes but she was unconscious so there was nothing he could have done for her anyway.

I\u2019m a wife of 26 years and my husband has always prioritized my health issues, from having 3 babies, to an ruptured ectopic pregnancy. He was by my side every time I have been in the hospital. Fortunately, the only time we have had a child in the hospital was for my oldest\u201d appendix surgery but he was there too. He took his mom to countless rehab and chemo appointments, like every single one. \n\nHowever, he also worked during almost every one of those things because he has a demanding job. He was fortunate to be able to do his work via phone and email and bring along his laptop. Obviously, he was there for me when in labor but being able to stay on top of work with international clients was also necessary. I never felt unloved or unsupported because he had to check emails. But again, I felt very fortunate. \n\nI say fortunate because he had that flexibility. Not everyone does.

Plus, you don't want to have to share your wife's personal medical information right off the bat. It's a private, family matter, so unless you were the one having the surgery, its none of your jobs business. \n\nThe other issue is with being able to support your family. A new job with a good salary will allow for her to perhaps take time off to heal and not worry about the consequences of bills piling up. It's important to take into consideration the difficulties in obtaining jobs with good starting salaries and having bills paid comfortably; especially when medical emergencies happen. \n\nWith that in mind, your wife's response was valid, but based on emotions and stress. The comfort of knowing you would be close by was emotionally important, but not physically necessary because once you are prepped for surgery and put out, everything else falls into the hands of the surgeon. What will happen, will happen. But, if you have to choose, having a loved one, on hand, is always preferred. \n\nHow would she have felt if your job decided to put you on notice for taking time off so soon after starting?
