It's because there are social norms around answering the door, not windows.

The neighbor went out of their way to avoid the door and peep through the window and then knock. That is so far beyond a nice and safe introduction. That is creepy peeping Tom like stalker behavior.  OP needs to invest in some great blinds and a ring camera.  I would not be happy to have some random stranger look into my window. I would be pissed as hell. I would also report to the management the strange creep behavior because this is just the beginning.", "\" Would it have killed you to take 10 minutes out of your day to say hello and introduce yourself? In that aspect, you've been quite rude and antisocial by flat out ignoring her.\"\n\nWould it to have killed the neighbor to go outside and not bang on her window like a crazy person. Like the neighbhor obviously was knocking on her own window so she could yell that the bins were not supposed to be out. If she wanted to introduce her self she could have walked outside and said something.
