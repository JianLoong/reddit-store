{"id": 10215, "submission_id": "114sppn", "title": "AITA for objecting to a group of people coming in and playing a loud game at my table in a coffee shop?", "selftext": "My team at work is remote, so I work from home. I typically spend part of my workday at a local coffee shop where most customers are working on their computers. It\u2019s a popular spot, so sometimes it\u2019s hard to find a table. Often, customers who don\u2019t know each other will end up sharing the largest tables. \n\nWhen I arrived at the coffee shop today, the only open table was the largest table in the shop. It wasn\u2019t an enormous table. It seats 5 people total, but only 4 comfortably. I set up my computer and got to work. I was finishing up a weeks-long project against a deadline later today.\n\nAbout half an hour later, two men approached the table and asked if anyone was sitting on the other side. I said no and moved my sweatshirt off the table to make room for them. I assumed they were there to work because they wore backpacks. They set their backpacks down and went to order their drinks.\n\nWhen they came back, one of them said to me \u201cjust so you know, six more people are coming and we are going to play dungeons and dragons here, so it will be pretty loud.\u201d I objected. I said that it was fine if they were here to work or have conversation on the other side of my table, but trying to squeeze 7 people into the 4 remaining seats and playing a loud party game wasn\u2019t going to work for me. They told me I was entitled and that, because this was a public space, I basically just had to deal with it. \n\nI thought this was rude. I told them they were crowding me out of my own table because it would impossible for me to work at the table if they were using it as a game table with a lot of other people. They had already asserted that it would get \u201cvery loud.\u201d I decided to leave because I didn\u2019t have time to waste with a fast-approaching deadline.\n\nAs I was packing up, they mocked me for being upset, saying that they were \u201cconfident I\u2019d figure it out\u201d and that \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d. \n\nBecause there were no open seats in the coffee shop, I just went home.\n\nTo me, it seems that if someone is at a table first then anyone who joins that table should be basically respectful of that person. Yes it\u2019s a public space. But am I really entitled for asking that they not disrupt my table with a loud game, because I was already sitting there? What\u2019s the etiquette for sharing tables in a public space?", "created_utc": 1676655599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114sppn/aita_for_objecting_to_a_group_of_people_coming_in/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one cares that you\u2019re working. Being out in the world means coming into contact with others who have differing priorities or reasons for being in the same place as you.
