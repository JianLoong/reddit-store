Also, my fins aren\u2019t your usual ones, they\u2019re true freedive fins almost 3ft long, carbon fibre and they were very expensive for me to buy, almost $400.

There is also a small section which is 4m (about 13ft) deep for diving boards. \n\nI was at the 1.5m section with my buddy when this happened. Part of my training involved being face down in the water with my legs out behind me and this of course meant that my fins were sticking out. During one exercise I felt someone bump into my right hand fin, so I put my head up to see what was happening. It was a teenage girl, maybe 15ish. I explained to her in the local language (I happen to speak it) that she needed to look out for other people. \n\nI continued with the exercises with my buddy but the same thing kept happening. It was obvious that she just wasn\u2019t listening to anything I\u2019d said or watching what she was doing. If anything she seemed more interested in being stupid in front of her friends. It happened multiple times and I tried to remind her gently. \n\nThe last time it happened, the fins were bent into a semi-circle and I became really annoyed because of this and instead of being nice, I basically laid into her and told her that if she wanted to be an idiot then I hoped she had the $400 to replace my fins when she broke them.

Asking people to literally not bump into you repeatedly is absolutely grounds for losing your cool. OP did nothing wrong.", "YTA. Could you see if the pool would allow you to hire a lane for a set amount of time? Sure, it'll cost more than a standard swim, but is a much more practical option if the swimming pool offers it. Then you will have the right to tell people to bog off out of your lane if they're in it.", "NTA after the first time you told her she deserved a can of whoop ass.", "NTA. I get that it is a free space and bumping into someone will happen, but she then began to bend them which showed clear intent. That is not ok! It is NOT bumping into someone, it is messing with them in their personal space. What is wrong with people here? This was harassment.", "As someone who was a lifeguard for 7 years i see situations like this all the time and theres a bit of a trade off. \n\nInfo: were you in a lane/ does the pool youre at have swimming lanes or an adult area? \n\nGenerally its seen where the open space is for kids to play in and lanes are for ppl that are there for more serious reasons like to train. If the pool only has open play space, then the issue is you poorly picked your pool. I get this is one of the few that allowed the fins but if it doesn\u2019t have designated spaces for playing vs not, then you need to keep looking for a different pool. \n\nI see a lot of comments saying yta but i think this is more of an ESH. The girl was 15, that is old enough that she should be aware of her surroundings and how shes affecting other ppl. Her bumping into you and getting a few warning but still doing it is on her. If youre 15 and are not considerate of the ppl around you, youre bound to get yelled at eventually. I saw it happen very often at the pool i worked at where teens got berated by older swimmers for getting in their way and being inconsiderate and as a lifeguard at a nicer pool part of my job was literally watching out for kids and teens that didn\u2019t respect other ppls space and we would tell them to cut it out. But this going back to the info part bc my pool had lanes and open swimming sections. So when kids were in lanes we took the adults side. HOWEVER, there were also plenty of times where an adult would chose to swim in the open swim area. And in those cases we would take the open swimmers side and point out to the adult that if they want uninterrupted space they need to be in a lane. \n\nIf the set up of the pool youre at is only play space, you need to find a different pool. I dont think your TA for yelling at the girl since she had warning first. The unreasonable AHs ive seen go off on kids at my pool always went off on them first time so you deff arent on their level. But you do need to recognize that different areas of pools usually have different uses and you should try to be as out of the way as possible. See, trade-off. You dont have free reign to take up any space you wish, but you are justified in point out a behavior that is just plain inconsiderate. Idk what this pools looks like, but when picking a place to train you need to take the layout of the pool and other pool rules, like adult only swim times or adult only swim areas, into consideration as well. Having the pool allow fins can not be the only qualification for a good place to train, that that part is on you if you didnt take these other things into consideration as well.", "YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re in a busy public pool. You were taking up a lot of space. It\u2019s expected you\u2019ll be bumped. If you want space you train at 5am or hire out part of the pool.

I'm gonna be the minority here. This is just my opinion, NOT A FACT.\n\nI'm saying ESH or NTA.

I personally feel like everyone is kind of jumping to conclusions about this whole thing.

But in another comment that OP responded to (they wanted more info), they mentioned how they were in fact with their friend who's an experienced diver.

This is hysterical (to me) when I picture the security guard that the scrawny kid was cussing out. After some truly violent incidents (the park is relatively near to some areas with very high crime) they hired the \"Task Force\". We no longer had mall-cop level security. We only had off duty cops and actual prison guards. And it seemed like only the biggest and most intimidating guards were hired. I once walked behind a big gate that led to an employee only area to find two Task Force guys with their knees on the heads of two shirtless guys covered in gang tats as cops were putting cuffs on them.\n\nThe point of all this is that the kid I dealt with was a moron from beginning to end.

Not even a local in the country but you want everyone to make way for you and follow your rules, in a public place. Demanding $400 if god forbid someone swipe past your precious fins. I\u2019m embarrassed for you.\n\nU know the self-entitled mfs who come into gym, set up their tripod, camera and lighting. A public space where everyone pays the same fee.

You went to a PUBLIC pool that is for the enjoy,ent of the PUBLIC and as a former free diver myself I can picture you, doing what is the most dangerous part of your training, somewhere I KNOW your instructor didn\u2019t tell you would be a good place to go or, probably, to be practicing without him there. \n\nBut from her point of view, not mine, I can picture all 9 feet long of you, upset that a young girl who could very well have been about the same height as the water she was in (I am 5\u2019 tall and was at that age which means that I have to tread water or skip along the bottom on my tiptoes to keep my head above water in 4 ft of it) and was trying to \u201cshow off for her friends\u201d by which I assume you mean have fun, be a 15 year old, etc. and as you are well versed in pools, you probably know that sounds and voices echo and it is very hard to hear what is going on around you from in the water, especially if your head is near it or if you are trying to comcentrate on someone else speaking to you or you yourself are speaking. Also, there are things like goggles and kids diving rings on the bottom, so when she felt your fins, she probably didn\u2019t think \u201cthese are that 9 ft long man\u2019s $400 fins, the man who was trying to speak to me. The one whose accent is hard to understand and keeps looking at me weird and I\u2019m a 15 year old girl who is practically naked and so I\u2019m just going to ignore him, hope he and his 9 ft pool hogging intimidating looking self goes away and just concentrate on my friends. And she probably felt really stupid when you yelled at her, and scared, and was thinking of how on earth she would get that kind of money and I would be shocked if you ever see her set foot in that pool again after that scare so well done. You are sooooo TA", "I would be so pissed if I was constantly being bumped by your fucking fins", "YTA: OP you are absolutely in the wrong here and seeing you try to justify your actions in the comments is sad, you got your rating and need to revaluate how you handle this stuff. This sub isn't for you to try and justify your actions and just makes you look more entitled than your post does, you yelled at a 15 year old child because they bumped into you which is bound to happen in a public pool. Depending on how tall you are taking up about 7ft-8ft in the pool with your fins, I doubt that this teenager was trying to be rude by bumping into you. What you did was way out of line, you yelled at a 15 year old girl and made her so uncomfortable that she decided to sit on the side of the pool for the rest of the time. The parents around probably don't think highly of you for yelling at a young girl and calling her an idiot. If someone was to yell at my child in a public space and call them an idiot I wouldn't be sitting by and allowing that to happen. You're extremely lucky you didn't get kicked out, and yelled at by other patrons. I wouldn't be shocked if people complained to the manager about your behavior, because this was way out of line. \n\nWatching you try to justify your actions of yelling at a 15 year old girl is just disgusting.", "YTA\n\nMajor /r/ImTheMainCharacter energy.", "I'm a diver myself, and there's a good reason why you don't use public pools for training.

Also, not really sure why this guy needs top of the line fins? When I started my instructor insisted I get a much cheaper set in case I tried to stand on them like pointe shoes. I absolutely tried. \n\nAlso as a scuba diver with specialty equipment, don\u2019t bring gear and expect people to not be interested. People will get close and ask questions, be prepared to politely explain.  If you have gear people will ask. They might also not know to keep their hands to themselves.", "I couldn't help but notice OP mentioning that the kid was a local and that OP spoke their language, neither of those things is relevant to what happened. But it leaves a bit of a taste in my mouth, considering that famous diving regions are often in countries where people cannot afford to spend 400 bucks on expensive toys. So OP wasn't just an AH for the ridiculous behaviour, but also for showing off and looking down on the locals. As a tourist you should be on extra good behaviour and absolutely never make children cry to a degree that they spend the rest of the day being consoled at the side of the pool. Who knows if that was even a 15 year old as OP states. Probably was a much younger child, that was terrified at that stranger yelling at them.", "An awful way to lose a friend, I'm so sorry. \n\nI had a friend die while cave diving, one of the most dangerous \"hobbies\". It's awful bc the longer he did it, the more he felt like \"those people who died cave diving just werent as smart/prepared/skilled as me.\" \n\nI remember a girlfriend leaving him because of all the anxiety she had when he left on a diving trip.
