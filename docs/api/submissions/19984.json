Also, my fins aren\u2019t your usual ones, they\u2019re true freedive fins almost 3ft long, carbon fibre and they were very expensive for me to buy, almost $400.

There is also a small section which is 4m (about 13ft) deep for diving boards. \n\nI was at the 1.5m section with my buddy when this happened. Part of my training involved being face down in the water with my legs out behind me and this of course meant that my fins were sticking out. During one exercise I felt someone bump into my right hand fin, so I put my head up to see what was happening. It was a teenage girl, maybe 15ish.

It happened multiple times and I tried to remind her gently. \n\nThe last time it happened, the fins were bent into a semi-circle and I became really annoyed because of this and instead of being nice, I basically laid into her and told her that if she wanted to be an idiot then I hoped she had the $400 to replace my fins when she broke them.

Not OPS fault a 15 year old couldn't comprehend \"leave me alone\".\n\nThen again I might be biased because as a teenager I knew better than to continuously mess with someone after they asked me to leave them alone. Perhaps that's not as commonplace as I thought it was.", "YTA.

I get that it is a free space and bumping into someone will happen, but she then began to bend them which showed clear intent. That is not ok!

This was harassment.", "As someone who was a lifeguard for 7 years i see situations like this all the time and theres a bit of a trade off. \n\nInfo: were you in a lane/ does the pool youre at have swimming lanes or an adult area? \n\nGenerally its seen where the open space is for kids to play in and lanes are for ppl that are there for more serious reasons like to train. If the pool only has open play space, then the issue is you poorly picked your pool. I get this is one of the few that allowed the fins but if it doesn\u2019t have designated spaces for playing vs not, then you need to keep looking for a different pool. \n\nI see a lot of comments saying yta but i think this is more of an ESH. The girl was 15, that is old enough that she should be aware of her surroundings and how shes affecting other ppl. Her bumping into you and getting a few warning but still doing it is on her. If youre 15 and are not considerate of the ppl around you, youre bound to get yelled at eventually. I saw it happen very often at the pool i worked at where teens got berated by older swimmers for getting in their way and being inconsiderate and as a lifeguard at a nicer pool part of my job was literally watching out for kids and teens that didn\u2019t respect other ppls space and we would tell them to cut it out. But this going back to the info part bc my pool had lanes and open swimming sections. So when kids were in lanes we took the adults side. HOWEVER, there were also plenty of times where an adult would chose to swim in the open swim area. And in those cases we would take the open swimmers side and point out to the adult that if they want uninterrupted space they need to be in a lane. \n\nIf the set up of the pool youre at is only play space, you need to find a different pool. I dont think your TA for yelling at the girl since she had warning first. The unreasonable AHs ive seen go off on kids at my pool always went off on them first time so you deff arent on their level. But you do need to recognize that different areas of pools usually have different uses and you should try to be as out of the way as possible. See, trade-off. You dont have free reign to take up any space you wish, but you are justified in point out a behavior that is just plain inconsiderate. Idk what this pools looks like, but when picking a place to train you need to take the layout of the pool and other pool rules, like adult only swim times or adult only swim areas, into consideration as well. Having the pool allow fins can not be the only qualification for a good place to train, that that part is on you if you didnt take these other things into consideration as well.", "YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re in a busy public pool. You were taking up a lot of space. It\u2019s expected you\u2019ll be bumped. If you want space you train at 5am or hire out part of the pool.

I'm gonna be the minority here. This is just my opinion, NOT A FACT.\n\nI'm saying ESH or NTA.

I personally feel like everyone is kind of jumping to conclusions about this whole thing. OP gave more details in the comments and that moved me more towards a \"ESH\" or a \"NTA\". \n\nFor example, someone mentioned how they should've trained with a professional or someone experienced and said \"YTA\". But in another comment that OP responded to (they wanted more info), they mentioned how they were in fact with their friend who's an experienced diver.

Plus he might need his footing for the exercise.", "Yelling at any 15 yo to berate them is an AH move. Yelling at one you don't know is worse tho.", "Moving would have been the thing to do to de-escalate, fair.\n\n\nIf op isn't practicing alone that might be hard though.\n\n\nI read it as him raising his voice a bit in frustration, not full on yelling. I'm sensitive and it wouldn't take much to make me cry. Maybe I misinterpreted?", "The problem I do have with answers like these is that, and I am not here to offend you, they are filled with assumptions. \n\n\"I'm actually convinced\" is not an argument if you weren't there. And I already wrote it in another comment: In free diving training sessions, especially when you start, you're being hold by different body parts to check out if you're getting tense. Do I know that he floated? No. Do I have to believe that he was being static, because he wrote so? Yeah, well, at least if I wan't to judge the situation like this subreddit intended: A personal view on a conflict based on the facts I get delivered. \n\nI would put money on the fact that this girl wasn't accidentally bumping into him but on purpose after what I read. Does it matter? No, absolutely not. \n\nThe tone of his post tells me this girl is at fault no matter what for \u201cacting stupid in front of her friends\u201d. And the tone of you post tells me that OP is at fault for being able to afford 400 something something fins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm also not here to argue, but maybe sometimes it's nice to take a step back from personal experience and emotions and see the situation as it (probably, if OP is not lying about the space and the permission from lifeguards/pool manager) is. \n\nI also would like to mention that everyone seems to be convinced that the lifeguards are not able to make professional decisions (simply telling him no) or banning him from the pool if necessary. All while the poor lifeguards are not able to do their job, b*ut just because of OP.*", ">I don't think trying to get her reprimanded by management would have been justified. \n\nWait, should you talk to the people in charge or no???", "Yeah, we don't know that, but it sounds like a possibility. All in all around it's a wild post and I can say that I'm gladly losing karma and enjoy to be here.\n\nJust imagine someone bumped in your shopping venture a few times and people would say: Well it's a public supermarket, the same girl is gonna bump into your cart a few times, don't be an asshole.", "Most adults you know go to a public pool to float? Like on rafts? Cause those are banned in every public pool I\u2019ve ever been to, specially because they take up too much room in a shared space. Without rafts? Ok, but they\u2019re going to get bumped and splashed and whatnot. It happens. Public pools tend to be very kid centric spaces and while adults try to police their behavior, they can only do so much. \n\nRegardless, I find it odd for an adult to go into a kid centric recreational space and yell at kids for being thoughtless. Can you do it? Sure. But, people are going to comment on it.", "Your 400 buck cart too!"]}
