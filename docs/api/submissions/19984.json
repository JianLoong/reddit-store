Also, my fins aren\u2019t your usual ones, they\u2019re true freedive fins almost 3ft long, carbon fibre and they were very expensive for me to buy, almost $400.

This means you have to\nbe fairly careful. \n\nThe pool is your standard type with a shallow end of 60cm-1.5m (from 1ft-5ft in depth) and then it slopes down to 2m (7ft). There is also a small section which is 4m (about 13ft) deep for diving boards. \n\nI was at the 1.5m section with my buddy when this happened. Part of my training involved being face down in the water with my legs out behind me and this of course meant that my fins were sticking out. During one exercise I felt someone bump into my right hand fin, so I put my head up to see what was happening. It was a teenage girl, maybe 15ish. I explained to her in the local language (I happen to speak it) that she needed to look out for other people. \n\nI continued with the exercises with my buddy but the same thing kept happening. It was obvious that she just wasn\u2019t listening to anything I\u2019d said or watching what she was doing. If anything she seemed more interested in being stupid in front of her friends. It happened multiple times and I tried to remind her gently. \n\nThe last time it happened, the fins were bent into a semi-circle and I became really annoyed because of this and instead of being nice, I basically laid into her and told her that if she wanted to be an idiot then I hoped she had the $400 to replace my fins when she broke them.

Thinking about more, it\u2019s really selfish for you to be doing this in a public pool without an assigned professional helping you.  Free diving is dangerous and you\u2019re putting your body at risk just training for it.  You\u2019re forcing lifeguards to pay more attention to you and taking their attention from the others.
