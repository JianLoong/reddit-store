She won't have the assimilated amino acids to keep up for long and may soon become too out-of-breath to speak. Extra points if she stops to rest somewhere and you say something cute about protein, keep walking, and get away clean.", "NTA. My birth mother also met me at 23 and tried to tell me I\u2019ll have to stop eating pork. I told her not to make kids with Chinese men if that\u2019s a concern. I cut her out of my life almost exactly 7 years ago.", "NTA. You met her, you didn't like her. You don't owe her anything. \nMilkshakes are delicious.", "NTA\n\nyou met, it went badly and you don't want to do it again.\n\nI see nothing wrong with that.", "This is an entirely personal decision. No one here should call you an A H for making any decision as to whether or when you ever see her again. Your parents' take on this has merit, and is a kind and generous way to handle this, but if it were me I'd be thinking that was your first real interaction, ever, and if that's how she chose to approach it, it's pretty much a huge red flag about her character and judgment that would definitely have me saying 'yeah I'm good' to any future requests.   \n\n\nNTA", "I think you\u2019re right to identify her behavior as a red flag. If you feel weird about her, don\u2019t invite her back into your life. You already have two great parents. You don\u2019t need a third. It is not your responsibility to give your biological mother validation. You need to look out for yourself first. She is not entitled to be in your life.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not required to have any contact with her, and at 23 unless you feel the need to see here I don't see why you should bother except to get medical history.  She was out of line, and frankly that sounds crazy pants anyway so I'd steer clear, but that's just me.\n\nGood luck.", "This is so strange. She sounds different..... I don't think you did anything wrong. Btw some influencer just died on the fruit diet so definitely don't follow her advice. It's totally your decision if you want to see her again. You don't owe her anything and I wouldn't bend over backwards to meet her in a place without food. A restaurant or a coffee shop sounds like a good neutral location. My sister was also adopted and met her birth mother a few years ago. After a few meetings, my sister also decided to to not continue a relationship because the woman had clearly not worked through all the issues she had regarding the adoption and my sister found it very uncomfortable to be around her. She also tried to act like a mother to her and my sister was not going to let that happen. Our mother passed away from cancer 10 years ago and she made it very clear our mother was the only mother she had. My point is that you don't owe this woman anything. Do what makes you feel comfortable. NTA", "NTA. It's your decision to make.", "NTA - It's up to you if want a relationship with her. You met her once and that might be enough to know that you don't want to be around her.", "NTA.  You don't owe her anything, and it is your right whether you want to see her again.  At the same time, I'd give her another chance.  She might have been nervous to meet you,  and was just babbling and said the wrong thing.  I have no idea what her situation was when you were born, but she might have a lot of emotions and thoughts swirling in her head sitting down with you the first time.  Feelings and fears can be overwhelming and make people do and say the wrong thing often.", "NTA\n\n\"family\" is more than blood relations, as you said the people who raised you are your parents/family. not only did you give it a shot and it didn't work out, she and her husband are now berating you for your birth mother's behavior and spinning the blame onto you. she was clearly fine with going out to eat but likely didn't expect anything to happen from being awful to another person.\n\nblock her, lock your account or close dms, and enjoy the rest of your life. you really dodged a bullet getting put up for adoption by this lady.", "NTA. My bio father really wants to meet me, I do not want to meet him and that is that. The way I see it is that your mother made the choice to give you up for adoption, it is now your choice whether you want a relationship or not.", "NTA\n\nYou've got two great parents and whether you see her is strictly your call.  \n\nIf it were her posting instead I'd suggest writing you a heartfelt note, apologizing and asking for a second chance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's not a polite or kind or loving behavior.  It sounds controlling, not healthy.

If someone is blaming how this went on you, they are not people to go to for advice about this.  This is not your fault.  This woman should have learned by now how to adjust to being in food establishments that don't cater to her diet.  Most people with limited diets have to adjust in some way, to go out in public.  This is not your fault.  \n\nIt's the parents' job to build the relationship with the child.  It's not the child's job to build the relationship with their parents.  She made her choices, and one of the consequences of her choices is that you do not see her as a parent, but as a stranger.   \n This is not your fault, and it's not your responsibility to fix her feelings, or give her what she wants from you.  **You do not owe her anything,** because she's the one that cut off that relationship, not you.\n\n *AITA for wanting to shut things down so quickly?*\n\nNot at all.

Your adoptive parents are the people who stepped up and put in the leg-work to raise you to be the person you are today. \n\nShe has no right whatsoever to try to step in and parent you again, for several reasons. One being that you\u2019re already an adult, another being that you\u2019ve just met, and another being to try to peddle this frankly absurd \u201cfruitarian\u201d diet to you and scold you for ordering a milkshake. \n\nAs someone who\u2019s been through the process of re-uniting with long lost biological relatives, the initial stages of connection should be to build a relationship and answer questions. They should be handled with care. The absolute last thing she should be doing is berating you for your choices (even micro-choices like what you order in a cafe) when she didn\u2019t want to be around to parent you. \n\nShe initiated contact with YOU, and she badly misjudged the situation.", "NTA, this is not really up to anyone else. This is only about you. I am so glad you were adopted by good people who love you and treat you well. If this woman makes you uncomfortable,  if you have no questions,  if you feel you have a full life, are not missing anything, you don't owe her more. If you have any questions, family medical history,  including mental health things, it might be a good idea to get that information. But this is only about you. You owe this person nothing.", "NTA . Unless you were eating animals while they are still alive, she has no business scolding your dietary habits. She wanted to be in contact with you, not the other way around - and that means she shouldn't alienate you when you don't share her views 100%. As a fruitarian she has met her share of people who do not share her views, so you disliking her way of speaking to you should not come as a surprise.", "NTA x a million. She found you on Instagram?

I was adopted and meeting my bio family has largely been chill, but to the point where I was essentially immediately treated like I\u2019d always been there\u2014which was weird and confusing to me at times and could feel like overstepping. I recognized it came from a well-intentioned place, and things settled over time. And something I came to realize is that it can be very strange to meet someone you\u2019re related to, and have all these weird similarities to, and treat them like a stranger when normally you treat those people like family\u2014especially if you\u2019ve known about and thought about them for years. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe her a relationship, but if you think you might regret acting so hastily in the future, it might be worth seeing if this one encounter can just be chalked up to clashing perspectives and expectations and if a little bit of communication can shift that moving forward.", "NTA she\u2019s not your mother.

Hopefully she will, too.", "NTA", "NTA. I too am adopted with amazing parents. When i was 14 or 15, my birth giver got into contact with me via letters. We wrote to each other for a bit then she sent a letter stating that she hated my mom because she \"stole\" me from her (she still had parental rights even when i was in foster care in one state and she was in another state across the country. The courts tracked her down to have her sign away her rights so i could be adopted by my mom and dad) when i was a baby (i was adopted when i was 8 years old, not really a baby) and she wished that she could come and get me and we could be a family again. She was calling my mom all sorts of names and that was it for me. I told her that i wanted nothing more to do with her and to stop contacting me. I have never regretted that. A couple of years later, she came to town and wanted to meet up with me and i declined. Again, never regretted it. \n\nYou do you.

If you want to in the future, I agree with your parents: don't involve food.", "NTA\n\nYou do not have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do.

But most importantly you don\u2019t owe her anything, you have the parents that raised you and if it\u2019s too much for you to deal with then don\u2019t feel an obligation to. It\u2019s not your burden to take on unwillingly, you have a choice here. At the end of the day it\u2019s your comfort that matters most.

I bet you get all the amino acids in your diet!", "Although I agree that raw vegan and fruitarian diets are stupid and can be dangerous if not meticulously planned and properly supplemented (B12 is important!!), those articles about the vegan influencer dying of malnutrition are BS clickbait.
