This generally does not bother me as I also have close male friends and don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem as long as the relationships are platonic.  The only issue I have with my boyfriend\u2019s female friends is that I sometimes feel that he places their needs above mine, or doesn\u2019t treat me much differently than his female friends.  I fee there should be a very clear difference in the nature of relationship between your platonic female friends and your female significant other.  We\u2019ve had discussions about this before, and how I feel bothered about it. \n\nBefore the story, I also want to say that I am one of those annoying people who NEEDS a cup of coffee in the morning to function and my boyfriend knows this.  \n\nLast weekend, 2 female friends of his came to stay with us.  I like them and get along with them so it\u2019s all fine.  Friday night, we went out for dinner and had a few drinks.  On Saturday morning, my boyfriend got up and made coffee and breakfast.  I came down 15-20 minutes later than everyone else, so they were all finishing up their first cups of coffee.  I went into the kitchen to pour myself my first cup, and my bf follows me in and says \u201cdon\u2019t take it all in case x and y want some more\u201d.   This immediately ticked me off, as there was only enough left for 1 full cup.  I said I wanted my first full cup, and we could make more if anyone wanted more.  I could tell he was annoyed, but he just walked away.   \n\nLater, he completely chewed me out for being rude and a bad host.  I told him I thought it was unfair for him to expect me to give up my cup of coffee for his guests when they\u2019d already had one.  It turned into a big ugly fight and left me feeling pretty hurt and misunderstood.  It sounds so petty but it really stems back to me feeling second-best when his female friends come along. \n\nSo I want to know, should I stand my ground or am I actually in the wrong?", "created_utc": 1673898973, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dpn65/aita_for_drinking_the_last_of_the_coffee_when_my/", "score": 302, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I believe you can be a good host without it being a detriment.

Coffee is an important part of your morning routine, that doesn't have to change because his friends might want more? Also, again, just make more.", "You're NTA.

His reaction in this situation is completely unhinged and it\u2019s very concerning that this is a repeat behavior for him.", "NTA-- And if he wants to play the \"who was the bad host\" game, then it's him.\n\nHe knew the coffee was running low. You said you wanted your first full cup. \n\nHe could have used his super host powers of deduction to realize he should make more coffee.", "NTA and he's being childish.  Make another pot, easy enough.", "NAH\n\nSounds like he was raised in a family that believes it's important to treat your guests like family. However, you need to stand your ground.

You drank the last coffee that was ready to drink. Making more would have solved that problem and prevented anyone from being an AH.\n\n2 - Your boyfriend shouldn't have complained about you taking a first cup for yourself. He should have displayed as much concern for your wants and needs as for your guests.\n\n3 - You needing him to treat you better / differently than other females is a sign of insecurity on your part. You being bothered when he doesn't visibly treat you better is a you problem much more than a him problem. He's an AH for treating you worse, but he can't be expected to treat you better every instant of every day. You're his SO, not a goddess who must be worshipped at all times.", "Eh, you kind of are.

Why is he picking a fight over this?", "I can't believe y'all are arguing over it....like just make more. Bf is being fcukin dumb lol.
