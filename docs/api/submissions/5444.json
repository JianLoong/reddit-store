{"id": 5444, "submission_id": "ztf26v", "title": "AITA for not giving my wife my \"old\" MacBook Pro?", "selftext": "Here's the backstory.\n\nIn mid-November this year I got laid off. As part of my redundancy package the firm let me keep my company MacBook Pro (after wiping it, obvs). I'd only been with them for a year, so the laptop on which I type this missive to you now is also barely a year old. \n\nThe Good News - Four weeks later I managed to get a new job. After an extremely stressful month it's all worked out pretty well as I've secured a small pay rise, at a bigger firm, starting next month. The new gig will also give me a new laptop to work from. They are a deep tech firm, and in my contract there are quite clear stipulations about not using my computer for personal purposes, security risks, etc etc. Fairly standard stuff.\n\nOn hearing that I'll be getting a new laptop, yesterday my wife said, \"Great, so I can use your MacBook from now on.\" My wife works part time, three days a week, and studies to complete a certification in the rest of her time. I agreed to support her on this when she herself got let go back in September, and I'm currently shouldering almost all of our household outgoings (mortgage, utilities, taxes, etc).\n\nI mention this to show how she can't easily just go out and buy her own at the moment. My wife uses an older MacBook Air to work/study from. Admittedly, it is a little slow now, but she uses Chrome (Google docs, login to her school portal), the Spotify app, and that's about it. In other words, she really does not need a powerful computer. At all.\n\nHere's the issue - My \"old\" MacBook is now my personal computer, and frankly, I don't want to just give it away. She doesn't seem to get this, and doesn't understand why I can't just let her have it as I'm 'getting a new one anyway'. But my new work laptop is for work, and honestly, I want to keep my personal and work machines separate. And to be more honest, I feel it's a bit entitled on her part to just assume that she gets to keep it now.\n\nAt the same time, I am her husband, and I do want her to be happy. Maybe I should just suck it up and be a good provider. But man, I like this computer. I'm thinking I should offer to help her get a new Chromebook or something instead. But you tell me, AITA?  \n\n\n**TLDR** \\- Got to keep my work MacBook when I got canned. Now I'm getting a new work laptop from a new job, but it's for work purposes only. Wifey wants to take my 'old' MacBook for herself, but I want to keep it for personal use.

If you're not the type who doesn't like to let others borrow their tools, devices etc, you can let your wife borrow your laptop when you're at work or doing something else - just create a separate account for her.

You are absolutely correct to keep the business devices seperate from the personal.", "Nta, she has a personal computer to use and it doesn\u2019t sound like she needs a new one. If you give her yours, you won\u2019t have one. Your work computer will be for work. And I also understand not wanting to share- I share a lot of things with my boyfriend but my computer is one thing that I prefer feels like it\u2019s only mine and I take really good care of it. I helped him pick out a really nice one for himself and he does take care of it, but like\u2026 not in the same way that I take care of mine lol.", "NTA for hanging onto your personal laptop, which you actually need. Seriously, if she takes it, won't you need to get something new? Or... take her old one, which is weird?", "NTA.\nI\u2019m baffled she didn\u2019t\u2026 ask? Why did she speak like it\u2019s a certainty? \nIf that\u2019s how marriage works I don\u2019t want it. \n\nTalk to her about it- if she is upset then y\u2019all can work on getting her one in the near future. But that computer is yours and you can gift it however you see fit (or keep it!!)", "NTA. I've got a personal and work computers. My wife has the same. Her personal one is slow, so I let her use mine, as long as I'm not using it or if there's something urgent/important that her personal one can't handle.", "NTA. It's your personal computer. Makes sense.", "NTA she can use her MacBook Air until it dies and then you two can figure something else out. Macs aren\u2019t cheap, but there are cheaper laptops out there. I am still using my 9 year old MacBook Air with the only problem being the battery life, which is fine because I always bring my charger. If you can\u2019t use your new work computer for personal things I don\u2019t know why your wife would assume your old work laptop would be hers.", "You are definitely TA. That\u2019s your wife; you could easily share it. She\u2019s working and going to school not like she just wants it for fun. You don\u2019t have to give it to her. Obviously, if she has to use a slow computer for school that\u2019s extremely frustrating. I would hate to be your wife. Oh I have a nice MacBook Pro but let me buy her a Chromebook really?!? I bought my wife a MacBook Air and myself a MacPro (that\u2019s what she wanted). When she finished her degree she gave her laptop to my sister. My sister was going to college and couldn\u2019t afford a laptop. So we share one now for personal stuff and we barely use it since graduation. Before anybody goes off about how I must be a rich kid or something I\u2019m not. I worked full time (being a server/bartender) through school and payed for all our bills including her tuition.", "I get where you\u2019re at, I\u2019m a gamer and play on a bootcamped MacBook Pro. It was the top of the line model when it was new maxed ram, graphics etc. \n\nI assume yours is similar.\n\nINFO\n\nDo you need a heavy duty MacBook Pro?\n\nDoes she need something heavier duty than a MacBook Air? \n\nCan you just swap MacBooks with her?", "YTA FOR SAYING \u201cwifey\u201d.  For some reason that seems so patronizing but probably just me", "YTA", "INFO: what do you use the personal laptop for? If it's primarily just the occasional balancing of checkbooks or whatever, could you just use her old laptop and give her yours? It sounds like her separate finances aren't enough to seeing a laptop and yet she needs for academic and professional use, whereas unless you're a gamer, your phone and even an old machine should probably work. I can't remember the last time I used my personal laptop for anything other than printing documents out, and it's a 7 year old MacBook that does great with that.", "NTA but maybe just swap computers? I think it's fair to want some separation, but if she's using her slightly show model for everything she's going to be more impacted by the upgrade than you would be by the downgrade", "Compromise by a new laptop when you start the new gig and can afford it", "You can set up separate accounts on a MacBook Pro and she can\u2019t get to your stuff and vice versa.", ">  Why don't you both have your own log-ins on the MacBook, and share it?\n\nCome on...this isn't super serious suggestion.\n\nThis isn't the pre-computer era where each person can share the typewriter between typing papers and letters.  \n\nBeing married doesn't mean sharing all things, because logistically, some things just can't be shared \"fairly.\"", "My wife and her clusterfuck of a desktop/file management is the reason we have our own laptops, and she never uses my desktop. She'll use my laptop for the internet sometimes out of convenience.\n\nShe understands my ocd about it and it's never been an issue.", "This comment gives 'Markand SarahSmith' shared Facebook account circa 2005 vibes, and I don't like it.", "Sharing a laptop full time is a pain in the butt. You can\u2019t both work on a project at the same time. Yes, it\u2019s okay to have multiple profiles, especially for travel so you don\u2019t have to take two computers, but for every day it\u2019s super annoying", "> hers is running badly, and you have two computers\n\nHers is running slowly, most likely due to age and, as OP mentioned, the fact that she's the type to download media from dodgy sources, so chances are a little clean up would have her computer running adequately.\n\nAnd no, OP doesn't have two computers.  His company owns a computer (his work computer) and then he has a computer that his prior company told him to keep (his personal computer).  I don't bring my work computer home unless...I'm specifically working from home, and I don't do \"home\" things on my work computer.\n\n> Of course, you\u2019re still entitled to it but you should at least get her a whole new laptop that suits her needs\n\nOrrr...they could just continue as they are now since OP JUST started a new job while still shouldering most of the financial burden of their lives, money is a little tight for the moment, and wife's computer still actually functions. \n\nIt sounds like OP wouldn't even have a problem with her using **his** newish personal Mac for things as needed, but if she has a working computer for her purposes...it's just a little greedy and selfish to want the new thing, ESPECIALLY with the assumption that he can just use the new work computer instead, which most employers really don't like.\n\nShe works.  Macs are pricey, but unless she's got a specific need for one, she can do without and get something in her budget.", "Yea it's just you. That's a pretty common term.", "No body wants to share a laptop in 2022.", " Messy, how? \n\nAre you saying your wife would like spill crap on your computer?", "Same with underwear lol", "Please see my other comment below and do not buy a Chromebook. Many online school websites and software do not support proprietary laptops like those and require a Windows or Mac machine.", "PLEASE DO NOT BUY A CHROMEBOOK OR OTHER PROPRIETARY CHEAP LAPTOP. My online school's website very specifically DOES NOT support Chromebooks or similar devices on their testing software, and Blackboard doesn't work on it either. I had to buy a Windows machine to access them both.", "I second this. Chromebooks are not a good investment. Just because she uses chrome doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll like that POS better than the MacBook she\u2019s currently using.", "His wife is using a MacBook and running Chrome. She's going to be much happier with a Chromebook. Also? Chromebooks are designed for people like his wife. Not really that technically savvy.", "Please do not give this advice, you absolutely do not know what you are talking about.

So yes, OP needs to ensure that her laptop would be compatible all her school requirements.", "Sounds like her MacBook Air is compatible with school though, so she could use that for school and the Chromebook for torrents and such. If she wants a $2000 laptop, she can get one.", "I don't think Chromebooks can even use torrenting software, but regardless the idea that the ONLY alternative to one is a \"$2000\" laptop is just fucking ridiculous. And she'd have to juggle two different laptops? The hell kind of solution is that when she could just get ONE to replace the old aging one? Even a $500 Dell like mine works just fine for browsing, all school websites/software, and streaming media."]}
