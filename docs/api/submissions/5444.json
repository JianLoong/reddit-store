{"id": 5444, "submission_id": "ztf26v", "title": "AITA for not giving my wife my \"old\" MacBook Pro?", "selftext": "Here's the backstory.\n\nIn mid-November this year I got laid off. As part of my redundancy package the firm let me keep my company MacBook Pro (after wiping it, obvs). I'd only been with them for a year, so the laptop on which I type this missive to you now is also barely a year old. \n\nThe Good News - Four weeks later I managed to get a new job. After an extremely stressful month it's all worked out pretty well as I've secured a small pay rise, at a bigger firm, starting next month. The new gig will also give me a new laptop to work from. They are a deep tech firm, and in my contract there are quite clear stipulations about not using my computer for personal purposes, security risks, etc etc. Fairly standard stuff.\n\nOn hearing that I'll be getting a new laptop, yesterday my wife said, \"Great, so I can use your MacBook from now on.\" My wife works part time, three days a week, and studies to complete a certification in the rest of her time. I agreed to support her on this when she herself got let go back in September, and I'm currently shouldering almost all of our household outgoings (mortgage, utilities, taxes, etc).\n\nI mention this to show how she can't easily just go out and buy her own at the moment. My wife uses an older MacBook Air to work/study from. Admittedly, it is a little slow now, but she uses Chrome (Google docs, login to her school portal), the Spotify app, and that's about it. In other words, she really does not need a powerful computer. At all.\n\nHere's the issue - My \"old\" MacBook is now my personal computer, and frankly, I don't want to just give it away. She doesn't seem to get this, and doesn't understand why I can't just let her have it as I'm 'getting a new one anyway'. But my new work laptop is for work, and honestly, I want to keep my personal and work machines separate. And to be more honest, I feel it's a bit entitled on her part to just assume that she gets to keep it now.\n\nAt the same time, I am her husband, and I do want her to be happy. Maybe I should just suck it up and be a good provider. But man, I like this computer. I'm thinking I should offer to help her get a new Chromebook or something instead. But you tell me, AITA?  \n\n\n**TLDR** \\- Got to keep my work MacBook when I got canned. Now I'm getting a new work laptop from a new job, but it's for work purposes only. Wifey wants to take my 'old' MacBook for herself, but I want to keep it for personal use.

However I get your side and as the wife i wouldn't take it.", "NTA. Keep work and personal laptops separate. I have the same set up as you, work laptop and personal laptop.

My husband has a work computer and home computer. He is absolutely under no circumstances to use the work computer for anything not work related. Explain this to your wife. You can be nice and let her use it when you\u2019re not home or whenever you don\u2019t need it.

Even doing simple stuff like you mentioned on a slow computer is not fun.", "NTA. At my workplace they are also serious about telling us we shouldn't be doing personal stuff using work laptops. Security risks etc. We also have no admin rights and can't install random software we want. So, a personal laptop is a must have, even if I'm typing this on my work laptop while working from home. I mean, if you have a need for a personal laptop, then you have the right to keep it. If you're not the type who doesn't like to let others borrow their tools, devices etc, you can let your wife borrow your laptop when you're at work or doing something else - just create a separate account for her. Or buy her a second-hand laptop? I needed a MacBook at some point for publishing some app for macOS, so I got a used MacBook Air. Since I don't need it most of the time, I let my wife borrow it, but she's now using it all the time (our cat managed to drop and damage the ThinkPad tablet I bought for her - also second hand).", "NTA.

And you obviously need a personal computer for leisure.", "NTA - you're not getting a new laptop, you're receving a work tool, which is something very different that your wife doesn't seem to understand. You won't be able to use this laptop for anything not work related, not even casual browsing. \n\nRight now with your current arrangement you both have laptops that work, if you give her yours, you're effectively left with nothing (unlesss you switch to her curent one). \n\nAlso, going against the grain here about the whole sharing comments, but I totally get it. I don't share my laptop with my wife (I gifted her one) and we keep our laptops separate, we have different tastes, different interests, that way we both have our privacy and it works.", "NAH because some companies are getting REALLY tetchy about using work machines for anything that's not work related. You are right to be cautious, and you don't know the new place very well yet.\n\nBut wife is probably doing a lot of hours on that old air. What if you express your frustrations to her, and admit your whiff of resentment about her assumption, and see what you two can come up with?", "NTA\n\nYou now both have this own computers.

She needs it to complete her certification which I\u2019m assuming is for a better job that\u2019s helping you both long term. You need it for internet browsing. \n\nThere also used to be these things called family computers, and you can still set your computers up with multiple accounts and share them.

Sure her laptop works, but if its as laggy as you say then using it for anything would be downright infuriating.  \n\nits a mac so I doubt you\u2019re using it for gaming.  So what do you need a whole separate computer for? Photoshop or something?\n\nWhy can\u2019t you share it?? Its not like a phone which would suck to share, its a computer.  Many houses spent years sharing a single desktop computer and you guys are getting all bent out of shape over a laptop??  You aren\u2019t using it during the day as you would be working presumably so why cant she have it during the day and you get it after work?\n\nI guess you could argue E S H here as she seemed entitled to it, but you upgraded.

You\u2019re married - just share the laptop and I am sure this would be no inconvenience to you as most of the time, you\u2019ll be on the work laptop anyway.

She is using an old and slow computer to work and study, so obviously she would assume that you'd let her use your newer computer now that you will be using another, also newer, one for work. Because you're her husband, you two are a team, you're supposed to love her and support her, so why on earth wouldn't you want to share your computer so that she could work and study with a more appropriate device? \n\nAh right, because you're selfish and you want to have a personal computer solely for yourself, despite knowing your wife cannot afford one at the moment (because she's working towards a goal and making less income), and despite knowing you will not need that computer for work, at all. \n\nShe's not entitled.

You have a new computer for work, she has an old computer that she uses for her studies, and you have another new computer for kicks. Maybe you could trade your extra MacBook Pro to her for her Air, and that way you each have a good computer for the primary work you each do. I get wanting to keep a nice personal computer for yourself, but you\u2019re in a partnership, and the needs should be more important than the wants. Your wife NEEDS a computer for schoolwork, you WANT a computer for personal use. See how that works?", "NAH listen, technically sure you don\u2019t owe your wife anything yadda yadda yadda but when both people need a work computer, hers is running badly, and you have two computers, it makes sense for her to use the extra laptop that already exists.
