{"id": 5444, "submission_id": "ztf26v", "title": "AITA for not giving my wife my \"old\" MacBook Pro?", "selftext": "Here's the backstory.\n\nIn mid-November this year I got laid off. As part of my redundancy package the firm let me keep my company MacBook Pro (after wiping it, obvs). I'd only been with them for a year, so the laptop on which I type this missive to you now is also barely a year old. \n\nThe Good News - Four weeks later I managed to get a new job. After an extremely stressful month it's all worked out pretty well as I've secured a small pay rise, at a bigger firm, starting next month. The new gig will also give me a new laptop to work from. They are a deep tech firm, and in my contract there are quite clear stipulations about not using my computer for personal purposes, security risks, etc etc. Fairly standard stuff.\n\nOn hearing that I'll be getting a new laptop, yesterday my wife said, \"Great, so I can use your MacBook from now on.\" My wife works part time, three days a week, and studies to complete a certification in the rest of her time. I agreed to support her on this when she herself got let go back in September, and I'm currently shouldering almost all of our household outgoings (mortgage, utilities, taxes, etc).\n\nI mention this to show how she can't easily just go out and buy her own at the moment. My wife uses an older MacBook Air to work/study from. Admittedly, it is a little slow now, but she uses Chrome (Google docs, login to her school portal), the Spotify app, and that's about it. In other words, she really does not need a powerful computer. At all.\n\nHere's the issue - My \"old\" MacBook is now my personal computer, and frankly, I don't want to just give it away. She doesn't seem to get this, and doesn't understand why I can't just let her have it as I'm 'getting a new one anyway'. But my new work laptop is for work, and honestly, I want to keep my personal and work machines separate. And to be more honest, I feel it's a bit entitled on her part to just assume that she gets to keep it now.\n\nAt the same time, I am her husband, and I do want her to be happy. Maybe I should just suck it up and be a good provider. But man, I like this computer. I'm thinking I should offer to help her get a new Chromebook or something instead. But you tell me, AITA?  \n\n\n**TLDR** \\- Got to keep my work MacBook when I got canned. Now I'm getting a new work laptop from a new job, but it's for work purposes only. Wifey wants to take my 'old' MacBook for herself, but I want to keep it for personal use.

If you're not the type who doesn't like to let others borrow their tools, devices etc, you can let your wife borrow your laptop when you're at work or doing something else - just create a separate account for her.

You should not use your work computer for personal purposes. It opens you up to all kinds of problems. Get your wife a new computer without the bells and whistles that she doesn't need.", "Just buy her an M1 air for 800$ if you can afford it. They are on sale in a bunch of places and it\u2019ll last her a while.", "NTA. **you** aren't getting a new MacBook. Your job is getting one. \n\nYou still have the same one as before. She seems to not understand the separation between work and personal machines. \n\nHonestly if you can just get her her own device that would be the easiest way to solve it.", "NTA - but seriously, just give it to her and make her happy. Support her studies and be the awesome husband.", "No it\u2019s yours. And you also need your own personal one.", "Your not getting a new laptop, your \u2018new laptop\u2019 will be the same as you having a desktop in a work office that you can\u2019t bring home. You can\u2019t use this \u2018new\u2019 laptop for personal stuff without risking getting fired. Your wife needs to understand that you are NOT getting a new laptop and that you still have use for your laptop", "NTA it\u2019s yours. You\u2019re not done. You got laid off and earned it.", "NTA, but if you want this argument to die out, just spend like $800 on a MacBook air. they have the same processor and everything, but dont have great upgrade options in terms of RAM, SSD, and whattnot. It should suit her tastes greatly, and you can use her old macbook as a trade in and get a discount, also since she is still a student there is an additional education discount. I know $800 is not a small amount of money, but its cheap in terms of marital bliss.", "Just buy her a new one? It sounds like you guys are financially sound, so upgrade her", "NTA- It sounds to me like she doesn't understand the security issues that require your work laptop to be seperate. \nPerhaps try explaining that to her again. And offering to help get her a new one.", "NTA after seeing your comment on how she uses her own computer. Buy her the new one and keep the one you like.", "In theory it's a good idea but I'm in college and I have a lot of studying to do, so she would essentially be on the computer most of the time, if op's evenings are free and he wants to use it then, but his wife is studying then he can't.", "that old MacBook air is going to be a much better experience than a Chromebook.", "\u2018The cat\u2019", "Shell want the new one", "Did you not read the post? His work literally said not to use the WORK provided laptop for personal use as it imposes security risks. He does not have two laptops available to him to use leisurely. He has a work device and a personal laptop. \n\nHer laptop works for what she needs it for, and when they can afford a new one, I am sure they'll do so; but even if they don't, he still doesn't have two laptops.", "Be realistic. She\u2019s gonna want a new pro. She already has her eyes set and feels entitled to one. OP\u2019s gonna have to give in to keep a happy wife.\n\nThe move is wait till op starts and makes sure everything checks out. Give wife the pro with profiles. Then trade her old one in when funds allow. Remove profile. Everyone\u2019s happy.", "I got my degree in software engineering using just a chrome book. \n\nIt was surprisingly easy. The only exception was respondus lockdown browser, which is pseudo-malware so I kinda dodged a bullet. \n\nI can run matlab, VS code, Microsoft office, teams, you name it. I could even run virtual machines, so I was able to run stuff like Alteryx AI suite. \n\nAlso, if your \u201conline application\u201d is OS dependent, it\u2019s a shit program. The whole POINT of an online application is that it\u2019s easily accessible and portable.\n\nPeople underestimate chrome books, but having a Linux ecosystem and android apps goes a long way. The way I see it, if I was able to complete an engineering degree with one then it should be fine for most degrees.", "This is the way!", "Blackboard works on a Chromebook. Web and app so baffled. \n\nI've use my for uni which uses blackboard and no issues.", "NTA. Many work devices are managed and have a policy that they are not for personal use. On those devices you should not install your personal software.", "As someone who works from home, I couldn't do this  I wasn't given a laptop from my company (I'm an independent contractor) my fil actually bought me the laptop I do my work on.. my old one was given to hubby and his old one was passed to the kids. If I needed a 100% separate system for work then they wouldn't have exchanged hands but because I don't need it then that's not a worry. Everything I do on it is for work anyway and nothing else. The only one that doesn't currently get regular maintenance is the kids one \ud83d\ude05", "NTA. that laptop is YOURS, the new one isn't, it belongs to the company. You can't use it any way you want to like you can your own, because if the company tracks it etc, you could get in big trouble. If she wants a new one then she can save and get one, but she can't expect you to give up your personal computer. The fact she can't comprehend the reasoning is only because she doesn't want to. She wants her way and doesn't want excuses", "I would talk to her about the work computer rules. If you\u2019ve never had a job where you had a work device it can be hard to get. God knows when I worked at AT&T people got fired all the time for doing stuff on their work phones. She might not understand the gravity of no I can\u2019t check my personal email on my work computer.", "NTA. It's imperative to keep your personal computer separate from your work one if you have a job that requires it. When I was working online last year my company gave me a computer, and the only thing I used it for was work.\n\nI looked at porn on my personal computer, like a good employee.", "What if they want it at the same time, too many issues there. I'd recommend buying wife a cheaper/still decent computer when there's room in the budget. OP NTA", "My brother had something similar, but I didn't know if it was a security thing.

Either she needs a new one or her current one still can handle all she needs just fine.  If you can't communicate that your new laptop is for work only and this other Macbook is part of your severance package, I don't know what to tell you.  \"Sorry hun I don't really have a personal computer of my own and was planning on using this one for that.  Is your Macbook Air struggling to keep up these days?\"\n\nIn any case I've actually been shocked at how good iPad Pros can be these days.  You get the keyboard and trackpad attachment for it and I honestly think it would work phenomenally for people like your wife who only need to use a web browser and Spotify and that's about it.  Though now that I look at the website I think it should be really great considering how close it is in price to a new Macbook Air.  But again either she needs a new computer or she doesn't.  And you either have $1600 in your budget or you don't.", "Sure. But it isn't hers.", "My brothers Chromebook from school was covered with hot Cheeto dust \ud83d\ude2d", "This isn't really related at all.

They are great if you are literally using them for email and to listen to music and search the news.

Barely works, closed source, relies on low-level exploits to function. \n\nIf your \u201capplication\u201d needs to install hooks into the OS kernel to function it\u2019s not an application. It\u2019s malware.", "I think it\u2019s also worth saying that because she\u2019s a student, she would qualify for student discounts on laptops from some places (Apple has one, for example; I think best buy might too). There are ways to get discounts that do _not_ fuck people over by buying shit chromebooks.", "I barely understand any of what you just said. But I agree. Fucking anoyying thingy", "My school sent out emails at the beginning of my semester specifically saying not to use Chromebooks because they don't work with their version of Blackboard.

Like nta, but also y'all are married \"can I have your old laptop since you got a new one, bc school?\" is not an unreasonable request.\n\nYou wanting a separate personal device, such that your 'private' searches don't appear on your company PC is also reasonable. Maybe just explain exactly why u need the separation?\n\nAlso, idk what you use the personal one for. But would it be possible to trade your wife, your newer MacBook for her older one? Is there stuff you do in your personal time that needs the added power?", "NTA I work in the same industry and can confirm that you absolutely need a home notebook that is separate from your work notebook. The firm will be trawling all over your work notebook in the background, watching everything that you do.

I use a 7 year old mac almost daily and it is still faster and nicer than most newer chromebooks. I would get her current computer cleaned up so it runs as fast as possible and if it\u2019s still not enough, help her buy a newer MacBook Air.

I don't even need a laptop and my husband of his own accord made me my own profile on both of his computers that he bought before we were married and he calls them \"ours\"...
