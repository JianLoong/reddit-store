{"id": 13202, "submission_id": "12244qy", "title": "AITA for refusing to babysit my nibbling's?", "selftext": "I (32m) am childfree and don't generally like kids. I have 8 nieces and nephews ages 6 months to 3 years between my 3 siblings. 2 of my siblings and 5 of my nibbling's live within 20 minutes of me the other sibling and his children are not local.\n\nDespite not being a big fan of children I do have a good relationship with my nibbling's. We occasionally do things like go to the toy store or the zoo (with their parents also present) and I see them about once every week to 2 weeks. (at least for the local ones)\n\nOne of my hard boundaries is I did not choose to have children of my own and am not willing to babysit, parent or otherwise be responsible for someone else's children. I do not do diapers, bath time, fix kids meals or put them to bed.\n\nI will do fun things like have a tea party, read them a book, watch a show, play in the mud or other such activities with the understanding that I can give them back to the parents when we are done.\n\nAlso do not misunderstand, if it were a real emergency (someone is in the hospital ect..) I am willing to help out and look after them for a short period while they arrange for actual childcare.\n\nNow my mother is the exact opposite of me. She loves children and is more than happy to babysit every chance she gets, and doesn't understand why someone wouldn't want to spend time taking care of children. My mother also has absolutely 0 respect for my boundaries, not just in regards to this but in general.\n\nNow my mother had offered to babysit for my sisters kids tonight so she and her husband could go out to dinner. However my brother apparently has to go to California tonight for work and failed to properly arrange childcare in advance, so my mother told me she would need my help to watch all 5 (sister's 3 + brother's 2) if my brother couldn't arrange for someone else to watch his kids.\n\nDespite it not really being a question I refused, politely at first and then more sternly when she kept pushing. If it were a real emergency would be more open to it but I don't view my brother and his wife's poor planning as an emergency.\n\nNow my mother is calling me ungenerous for not wanting to help, and selfish with my time. This is untrue. While it's true I have and excess of time on my hands the issue is not time, it's that I am being asked to violate a hard boundary I am uncomfortable with, and I am plenty generous with both my time and money, buying nice gifts for my nibbling's, going over if one of my siblings needs help fixing something or cleaning up or moving, picking stuff up at stores for them when they don't have time.\n\nSo guys and galls and everyone else, am I the asshole?\n\nPS, almost forgot to add both my sister and brother are relatively well off and have nannies, they just normally don't work on weekends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit #1:**\n\nJust a few common things I have seen in the comments I figured I would address here.\n\n>My siblings are not the ones that are violating my boundaries. My siblings do not and did not ask me to babysit, my mother offered to babysit and then told me she needed my help. I was talking to my sister on the phone earlier today making plans to see her tomorrow and she never mentioned babysitting once, although she did mention mother was coming over to babysit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My mother did not ask me to help, she told me I needed to help. A minor detail but an important one in my opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My mother is perfectly capable of saying no to my siblings if she wants to. The idea that anyone could make her do anything she doesn\u2019t want to do actually made me laugh when I was reading the comments. I never thought about how people that didn\u2019t know her may interpret it that way. To quote my brother \u201cyeah but life\u2019s a lot easier if you just do what she wants\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My siblings both have full time nannies for their children. They just normally do not work at night or on weekends, this does not mean they could not arrange to have them work late or on the weekend if they needed to. Overtime pay exists for a reason.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1679788811, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12244qy/aita_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_nibblings/", "score": 192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a good relationship with them BECAUSE you place these important boundaries. You know yourself well. That's really healthy.
