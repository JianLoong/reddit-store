We occasionally do things like go to the toy store or the zoo (with their parents also present) and I see them about once every week to 2 weeks. (at least for the local ones)\n\nOne of my hard boundaries is I did not choose to have children of my own and am not willing to babysit, parent or otherwise be responsible for someone else's children. I do not do diapers, bath time, fix kids meals or put them to bed.\n\nI will do fun things like have a tea party, read them a book, watch a show, play in the mud or other such activities with the understanding that I can give them back to the parents when we are done.\n\nAlso do not misunderstand, if it were a real emergency (someone is in the hospital ect..) I am willing to help out and look after them for a short period while they arrange for actual childcare.\n\nNow my mother is the exact opposite of me. She loves children and is more than happy to babysit every chance she gets, and doesn't understand why someone wouldn't want to spend time taking care of children. My mother also has absolutely 0 respect for my boundaries, not just in regards to this but in general.\n\nNow my mother had offered to babysit for my sisters kids tonight so she and her husband could go out to dinner. However my brother apparently has to go to California tonight for work and failed to properly arrange childcare in advance, so my mother told me she would need my help to watch all 5 (sister's 3 + brother's 2) if my brother couldn't arrange for someone else to watch his kids.\n\nDespite it not really being a question I refused, politely at first and then more sternly when she kept pushing. If it were a real emergency would be more open to it but I don't view my brother and his wife's poor planning as an emergency.\n\nNow my mother is calling me ungenerous for not wanting to help, and selfish with my time. This is untrue. While it's true I have and excess of time on my hands the issue is not time, it's that I am being asked to violate a hard boundary I am uncomfortable with, and I am plenty generous with both my time and money, buying nice gifts for my nibbling's, going over if one of my siblings needs help fixing something or cleaning up or moving, picking stuff up at stores for them when they don't have time.\n\nSo guys and galls and everyone else, am I the asshole?\n\nPS, almost forgot to add both my sister and brother are relatively well off and have nannies, they just normally don't work on weekends.", "created_utc": 1679788811, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12244qy/aita_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_nibblings/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ive worked in childcare for 20 years and adore my niblings, and I support you on this. You have valid reasons for the clear boundaries you have set and it is ultimately best for everyone for you to keep them. ESPECIALLY the kids. You have a good relationship with them BECAUSE you place these important boundaries. You know yourself well. That's really healthy. The more you stand firm, the less people will push in my experience, because they will eventually just have to accept reality. If you give in, your Mom will absolutely keep trying to push your boundaries further, and that would suck both for you and the kids.

You can't force people to be in your village just because you decided to have kids. Also the sister going out to dinner with her husband isn't an emergency so if OP's mom feels they will be overwhelmed watching 5 kids than why can't sHE tell her daughter that she can no longer watch her children. So rather than telling her son and daughter that she can't watch their kids OP's mom wantst to get mad at OP and some how make it OP's fault because they don't want to help watch children that they never agreed to watch in the first place. NTA", ">AH. Your family got used to rely on you or your mother, you seem to be the only smart in the family that decided not to have children. There are many babysitters companies that your brother could call and pay, but I guess it's cheaper to take advantage of you and your mother? . If you do what your mother is askin\n\nI mean I feel I should clarify my siblings do respect my boundaries. They do not and did not ask me to babysit. My mother is the one with boundaries issues. Also the reason they ask my mother to babysit is she wants to. She likes spending time with her grandchildren, she could have said no to either of them. (maybe I should add an edit to clarify this...)   \n\n\nAs for babysitting services, as I mentioned at the bottom of my post both my sister and brother employ full time nannies it's just Saturdays and Sundays are their days off. If it were a true emergency well overtime pay exists for a reason.", "What people do in their free time doesn\u2019t translate to time that\u2019s \u201cup for grabs\u201d for their family.

Is your free time only truly yours if you have to first move to an inaccessible city when you\u2019re grown with your own job and place? Being child free is consciously choosing a lifestyle without such obligations just like choosing to be a parent means you have to adequately ensure the care of your children.\n\nNTA. Siblings aren\u2019t just automatic free short-notice childcare. Child free people choose that life for a reason and aren\u2019t looking to fill it with other people\u2019s kids; they\u2019re not special.

It was like step-sibling being called stiblings (which yes that is what this family also called the step-siblings in the family).  Mind you this was 2009 or 2010", "True. OP is likely in a shitty situation.   Maybe increased separation from the entire family is in order.", "That's an interesting point - she volunteered to watch some of them, but OP didn't say how she acquired the responsibility of the others.", "Lol check and mate", "Well that is an interesting question.
