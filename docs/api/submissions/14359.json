I\u2019m a 19M college student living with \u201cAlex\u201d a 20M fellow college student whose dating \u201cDana\u201d a 19F also college student. Alex and I pay for the apartment, Dana does not. She spends a lot of her day here and spends a few nights a week. I don\u2019t really care that much for her, I\u2019m not crazy social so her being in the apt is mainly unnoticed by me since I spend most of the day at school, work, and practicing piano. That\u2019s important, I promise. \n\nYou see, I really enjoy the piano. I own a keyboard that isn\u2019t great but it gets the job done and I\u2019ve had it since I was 15. I paid for it with my own money and I am weirdly attached to it. I don\u2019t like people to touch it or mess with it without my direct permission and supervision, and I treat it very gently since it\u2019s a bit old. \n\nWell anyways one day I was in my room doing homework in bed as usual and Dana came in to talk with me about something. I was just chatting with her about nothing super relevant when she sat down at my piano bench. Okay, whatever, she\u2019s not even facing the keyboard and clearly isn\u2019t interested in messing with it at all. Or so I thought. \n\nWe finish up talking and she stands up to leave, realizes she\u2019s been sitting in front of the piano, turns around and turns it on. I started getting stressed a bit but oh well. She starts playing a few notes with one hand, and I notice that it\u2019s come off it\u2019s stand about halfway. Her fault? Maybe, maybe not. I stood up and said something like \u201chey, it\u2019s about to fall, let me fix it.\u201d Before I could finish my sentence, she slams down with her left hand and the whole thing comes off the stand and hits the wood floor corner-first. It clattered to the ground and I noticed a little white shard go flying across the floor. I told her to back up and walk away so I could pick up the keyboard and assess the damage. \n\nUpon looking at it, I realized that one of the keys had snapped off. I tried not to get angry and plugged it back into the wall, only to find that it just wouldn\u2019t turn on. I sighed and told her just to leave and come back when Alex got home from work, since I just didn\u2019t want her around after breaking something so important to me.  She said I was being silly and that she wouldn\u2019t leave, just would go out to the living room. I responded that I\u2019d prefer she just completely leave, but if she were to stay in the apt she should just leave me alone. She left my room and went to watch television in the living rooom. \n\nWhen Alex got back she told him everything, with an emphasis on how angry I had seemed while asking her to get out. Alex agreed with her that I was being irrational and a bit creepy over everything, and that it wasn\u2019t my place to tell her to leave. I don\u2019t know what I should have done - I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s worth apologizing for since I was the one who has to pay for a new keyboard, but I want to know if I can handle it any better in the future.", "created_utc": 1681015840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g96y1/aita_for_asking_my_roommates_girlfriend_to_get/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I honestly can\u2019t tell. A lot depends on how you asked her to leave. So this is part INFO/part advice. \n\nFirst thing, if I were you, I\u2019d talk with your roommate. His guest came to your room and broke something meaningful to you. You\u2019re allowed to be upset at that. You\u2019re also allowed to ask her to leave, not only your room but also your apartment, if he\u2019s not there. She doesn\u2019t live there. She shouldn\u2019t have free reign as if she does. \n\nNext thing, You both need some boundaries here. I say both because the apartment belongs to you both. The girlfriend is always a guest, and you both need to have a convo about what you expect from your guests. For example, If you were to have a guest over (even when you\u2019re not home), then what are the expectations? If a guest damages the other person\u2019s property, then what are the expectations? \n\nLastly, if you need space from her being there a lot, then you have every right to say that. But, you *do* have to say it. \n\nQuestions:\n- does your roommate know that you think his GF has been there too often? Have you had convos with him about it?  \n- How you ask someone to leave should be respectful. I can\u2019t tell if you were or not. Screaming and being scary is not ok, but it seems more like you went quiet and rage-y? Was she acting scared of you? \n- did she know she broke it or did she think it just dropped/dinged? I would think she\u2019d offer to pay for it to be fixed (if that is possible?), but did she?", "I'm going to get downvoted for this but oh well.\n\nSince her boyfriend is on the lease then he can have her over when he wants as long as he wants even when he isn't there at all.\n\nHe can do all of that since he's on the lease as well, you want her gone then your roommate needs to be gone as well. \n\nThat simple.", "NTA. I say this because Alex & Dana should completely empathize with you considering they broke a piece of your property.\n\nHowever, this is a lesson on passive aggressiveness and how it can cause harm to you. You mentioned you were uncomfortable from the minute she sat down in front of the keyboard. At this point you should\u2019ve set boundaries or communicated the importance of the object.\n\nInstead, you passively sat there hoping she wouldn\u2019t mess anything up. There is no way for Dana to know the significance of this object to you because you didn\u2019t communicate it. Regardless, she shouldn\u2019t have disrespected your property. \n\nThe difficulty in this situation is that, from the way you describe it, Dana did not mean to break the keyboard. It was an honest mistake. You seem more upset that Dana would mess and subsequently break an object you hold so dear to your heart, but there\u2019s no way she would know the significance because you never set boundaries and communicated such. \n\nIt seems you are asking if she\u2019s the asshole for messing with a \u201cheirloom\u201d of yours, yet to her, there\u2019s no way she\u2019d know such significance. \n\nRegardless, it seems as though Alex & Dana have no remorse for Dana breaking your property, regardless of significance, so that makes them the asshole.\n\nI feel as though you\u2019re concentrating your anger in the issue in the wrong manner, though. You shouldn\u2019t be mad at Dana for messing with your most prized possession. You didn\u2019t communicate boundaries and you need to take responsibility for that. You could\u2019ve have told her to get up the minute she sat at the bench. \n\nYou can try to remedy the situation, if you feel compelled, by explaining the anger came because this piano was so important to you and you should\u2019ve explained that better so they\u2019d understand context. \n\nAgain, NTA. They should totally offer to purchase you a new keyboard.", "You can handle it better in the future. \n\nFor starters, I've been playing keyboards for almost forty years; I've never had one that was secure randomly fall off the stand because someone played it vigorously.  That tells me that it wasn't really secure to begin with, especially if she wasn't even facing it until she started playing it.\n\nSecond, you seem really tetchy.   The boundary you need to set is at your room, not at the apartment door: your roommates have rights too, and they can invite friends or lovers over.   If you don't want them in your room, rock on: that's where \"common space\" ends and \"private space\" begins.\n\nYTA.", "ESH. I know that seems weird, but you two obviously have a good enough relationship where she can be in your room. She was totally out of line, but you kind of elevated the shittiness.", "Nta. She needs to replace your keyboard and not be over if he\u2019s not over. She doesn\u2019t pay rent", "What the hell? She doesn't even live there, comes into your room, breaks your stuff and acts INDIGNANT over it?!\n\nWhat is wrong with people today?! Its basic courtesy to be immensely apologetic for that and to agree to leave. Then tell your BF and ask what you can do to make it up to him?\n\nWhat an awful person.", "NTA\nShe's your roommate's guest. Guests leave when the person they're visiting is not there.

It\u2019s your apartment, it\u2019s not her place to be there unless she is with Alex. \n\nAlso no apology? I would kindly ask her to please never come back. \n\nIt\u2019s probably time to find a new place/ roommate.", "Nta. She shouldn\u2019t be there when your roommates not there. Talk with your roommate and make boundaries.\n\nA normal nice person would have left after you asked them to because it\u2019s NOT THEIR HOME and the persons they go to see at that go is NOT EVEN THERE. \n\nThey will/are going to take advantage she will be there more than half the week even though it is technically NOT her home.\n\nIf I were you o would at least make it a requirement that no guest unless the person they are visiting is home. PERIOD.", "NTA.\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask to use your keyboard, she ignored you when you said it could potentially fall if its stand, proceeded to roughy play the keyboard which in turn broke it, and she didn\u2019t apologize?!

Who slams their hand down on a musical instrument? That doesn't belong to them?!? She needs to replace the keyboard. You need to sit then both down and tell them that she's banned until she makes it right. You could have gone off. You could have had her arrested for the destruction of property. She broke it. She needs to own her fuck up and do the right thing. Yes, it was old, but it was yours.", "NTA.  She broke your piano and she needs to replace it.  Also there is no reason for her to be in the apt when your roommate is not there, she does not live there!  Time for a serious discussion with your roommate.", "I'd report this for documentation purposes and then run to small claims court. See how she tried to change the narrative and portray OP as aggressive. Who knows what she'll cook in her head and accuse OP. She should pay for another keyboard and get the hell out of the apartment.", "NTA \n\nThis!\n\nThat\u2019s all OP needs to say. She\u2019s not allowed when he\u2019s not there. Make it a rule going forward\n\nEdit: input judgement", "It\u2019s not just the key that\u2019s broken the keyboard won\u2019t turn on at all", "100% this!", "^ This", "More like OP is a doormat", "NTA - you probably should have asked her not to play your keyboard if it's got some personal, emotional attachment.\n\n\n\n\nThat said, she broke it, and needs to reflect it. she doesn't live there so she has zero right to be there without her boyfriend there. Roommate is siding with girlfriend over what's actually right. Welcome to learning to deal with roommates", "That's absolutely insane of her, you're NTA but she definitely is. I'd be livid if someone busted any of my instruments especially when she seemed to do it on purpose by slamming her hand down on it as soon as you mentioned that you needed to fix how it was sitting or it would fall. One of them should replace it for you", "You don't need to pay for a new keyboard, she does. And until she pays for a new one and gives you an apology, she should be allowed back at the apartment.
