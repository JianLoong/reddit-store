She said she would get back to me, a week later she told me that she's now booked all of her holidays for the year but that we can go to London on a specific day, just that she's does have an appointment on that day also. \n\nI don't see this friend often, I was a little disappointed as it would mean I'd just be in London in a random location for a few hours while she had her appointment. Also it kind of felt like she was taking advantage a little since she knew I would be driving us.\n\nI decided to make the most of the day anyways and found a spa nearby and booked some treatments for myself at the appointment time. I didn't mention this to my friend until we where at the location, she said she was off and I said  \"cool, I'll be at the spa, let me know when you're done\" she looked confused but I had already started walking off. \n\nThe spa was lovely, I got a few treatments and half way through a massage i got a text from her saying she was done and asking where I am. I told her I was at the spa and that I was almost done.\n\nShe apparently went up to the front desk to book a slot too, but they said they were fully booked. When I was finally done I walked out to her looking really annoyed but she wouldn't say what the issue was. \n\nFinally, midway through lunch she said I was really rude for only booking myself into the spa and that I didn't even think about her and that she had wait outside.\n\nI said \"but you expected me to wait for your appointment to end in this random location?\" She insisted there where other things I could have done (not sure what she meant except hang out in tescos)  and that I was rude for how I acted. \n\nShe also brought up the fact that I'd waited for her before without issue. Which is true, but we had been in a shopping centre and I'd been able to just shop until she appeared.\n\nIt's been a few days now and while we are talking, she is being very cold and makes passive aggressive remarks about it, including the lack of apology. I spoke to my sister and she said she understood where I was coming from but also I could have just booked us both in and made the day more pleasant.

She was okay with having you wait around but didn't like it when the shoe was on the other foot. She took you and your time for granted. And she got used to that since you didn't say it was an issue for you. And that makes her (and your sis) feel like you're on the wrong. You're not. And you don't owe her an apology, I don't think. But next time don't let it get that far, speak out earlier. And this is a lesson for you, you are clearly not a priority for her. \n\nNTA. Just tell her that you didn't like how she wouldn't commit to making plans with you and how when you guys finally met, she expected you to be at her beck and call, with her and her plans coming first and you being expected to fit yourself around that.\n\nEdited. One word.", "NTA your friend does not respect your time but respects her own, she was fine with making you wait because she is important and not you (in her eyes) if she had booked she would have expected you to then wait as she would likely have finished after.\n\nShe mentions you did it before to put you in your place in the relationship with her as the superior it looks to me how she sees it. Perhaps i read into things but that is my opinion.", "NTA. She can't expect it to be okay for you to wait around, but get mad when she has to do the same thing.", "NTA- you try to plan a whole day of activities, and she only gave you one day as an option and it's not even a full day. Your life does not stop because she has an appointment. You are absolutely free to spend that time anyway you choose. She's giving main character vibes when she says that you had waited for her before so you why couldn't you just wait on her again. I feel like she likes you being the friend that \"holds her purse while she shops\" but is resentful of the fact that you didn't let her appointment spoil your day. Also, if you told her about how you plan to spend her appointment time and it was anything remotely fun she would've demanded that you wait for her so effectively telling you you're not allowed to have fun without her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow much advance notice did she give for the day she was available?", "NTA - Your friend clearly doesn't respect your time and is the selfish one for expecting you to just sit and do nothing whilst making her appointments. Had she told you beforehand when she would be finished with her appointments for the day?", "NTA you arranged something to cover the time she was otherwise occupied like a reasonable adult. She is not reasonable.", "NTA-you\u2019re being treated like a doormat. You are not her servant. I would ignore her messages referring to this incident. Answer all the other ones as if nothing is wrong.", "NTA. This woman isn't your friend. She used you for transport and had the audacity to be upset that you booked a spa for yourself while waiting.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" clearly thinks it's totally fine you wait for her, but not the other way around.  She's sulking because you found something cool to do instead of just killing time until the exact second she was done.", "Your friend seems to have an issue with time, between not being able to tell you when her appointment would end and thinking she could just book walk-in services at a decent spa.

I would think twice about this friendship, as this \"friend\" may not really be much of a friend at all.\n\nYou didn't have to book an appointment for her because she made you wait all that time to get back to you about what you were going to do, plus you were just supposed to wait willy nilly for hours while she had an appointment of her own? Your friendship is transactional to her... and has to always be in her favor. Reconsider the friendship, OP.", "Let me get this straight:  You booked the spa **during** her appointment and your friend is upset because she was not invited?  \n\nShe has an appointment and during the appointment time, which she expected you to wait for her, is quite simply your time and you can do whatever as you deem fit.  It is not like you were plotting a scheme to take over the world.  How you spend your time is your business.\n\nYour sister's suggestion is not wrong, but from what I gathered, your spa started during your friend's appointment, so her suggestion would not work.\n\nAnd maybe your suspicion is right, your friend is taking advantage of you as a driver.  Regardless of that, maybe you should review your relationship with a person that want to control how you spend your time, and freaks out when she found out that she was not included with some niceties of life like a spa.\n\nNTA.\n\nAfter all that spa talk, I want to get a massage.

She told you up front she had an appointment- you dropped it on her so she couldn't make a plan. You assumed she was taking advantage of you and decided to punish her for this assumption and now your playing the innocent- telling you didnt mention how long she had to wait for you to \"finally [be] done\". You could have told her before \"while your at your appointment I'm going to go to xyz spa, you should book yourself in for the end of your appointment, we can do abc treatment togeather before lunch\" and none of this would be a problem- but you wanted to be petty and now can't even pull up your big girl pants and apologize.

Great explanation.", "She originally said it would be 30 minutes, but as I knew it was a therapy session I knew it would be longer than what she claimed, so that's why I booked myself in for 2 hours of treatments. \n\nSo if I did wait for her I'd have been waiting 1.5 hours. The thing I feel guilty about is that she was in an appointment for her health and I decided to do something fun. And arguably the spa was nicer than the other activities we had planned for the day.", "I do wonder if she genuinely thought it would be 30 minutes (even though past ones have been 2 hours), or if she said 30 minute because she knew 2 hours might make me reconsider meeting up that day.", "Wow, what an assumption. OP never said they intended to hide the spa or tried to be petty. They just found an activity to keep themselves busy while the friend rudely expected her to wait, after already delaying confirmation on dates. OP did nothing wrong. They were in London and made a plan. If the friend cared to share in an activity, they should have asked OP about their plans. Not just go 'Oh you can wait for me' and not give a damn how they used their time. Because if I were the friend, I would have actively helped OP plan something to kill time.

That time I didn't tell her what i would be doing either and she didn't ask. \n\nThe spa could not have been done at any other point in the day since we have stuff planned, tickets booked. \n\nShe said her appointment would be 30 minutes, but it took 1.5 hours. (Her previous appointments usually took 2 hours). \n\nSo there wouldn't have been any time that she could have joined in the Spa. And the minimum stay was 1 hour. \n\nMy only guilt is that while she was doing the therapy she needs, I was doing something fun that she would have liked. And maybe we will go back together. But I couldn't have forseen she would be finished early.", "You're still assuming. Maybe it never came up? Maybe it didn't matter because OP deserves to do something nice while she waits. Either way, if the friend really cared to spend the whole day together, they would have planned a whole day. They didn't and gave scraps to OP. Petty or not (which again, you're assuming), OP doesn't have to tell anyone what she does with her free time. So clearly she's not the AH. The friend is for the terrible planning and not helping OP plan something for the waiting time. You can't just say to someone 'Wait for me, but don't do anything TOO fun while you wait'.", "Then OP could have declined. Or mentioned to her friend she felt taken advantage of. No one made OP wait, the appointment wasn't sprung on her day of. She knew before they made their plans that her friend had an appointment so she had the foreknowledge and time to plan for something to do. OP chose to be petty and make their friend wait instead of using her big girl words.", "You booked an appointment knowing that it could,and likely would, affect her. Cut this high school mean girl fake innocent shit out. You knew damn well that you would be making her wait and wanted to get back at her for feeling taken advantage of.

You can say \"I think\", but you don't know my intentions and you can't claim you do. \n\nShe said her appointment was 30 minutes, if I had believed her I would have either been waiting doing nothing for 1.5 hours. Or I'd have booked us into the spa together and then she would have been an hour late to the appointment.\n\nAlso, you're talking about how people are on reddit, while probably being the most angry person I've interacted with this week, both on and offline.", "Or I just know how to be an adult and keep worthwhile friendships through communication and genuine affection.
