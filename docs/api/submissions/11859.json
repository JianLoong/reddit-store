She said she would get back to me, a week later she told me that she's now booked all of her holidays for the year but that we can go to London on a specific day, just that she's does have an appointment on that day also. \n\nI don't see this friend often, I was a little disappointed as it would mean I'd just be in London in a random location for a few hours while she had her appointment. Also it kind of felt like she was taking advantage a little since she knew I would be driving us.\n\nI decided to make the most of the day anyways and found a spa nearby and booked some treatments for myself at the appointment time. I didn't mention this to my friend until we where at the location, she said she was off and I said  \"cool, I'll be at the spa, let me know when you're done\" she looked confused but I had already started walking off. \n\nThe spa was lovely, I got a few treatments and half way through a massage i got a text from her saying she was done and asking where I am. I told her I was at the spa and that I was almost done.\n\nShe apparently went up to the front desk to book a slot too, but they said they were fully booked. When I was finally done I walked out to her looking really annoyed but she wouldn't say what the issue was. \n\nFinally, midway through lunch she said I was really rude for only booking myself into the spa and that I didn't even think about her and that she had wait outside.\n\nI said \"but you expected me to wait for your appointment to end in this random location?\" She insisted there where other things I could have done (not sure what she meant except hang out in tescos)  and that I was rude for how I acted. \n\nShe also brought up the fact that I'd waited for her before without issue. Which is true, but we had been in a shopping centre and I'd been able to just shop until she appeared.\n\nIt's been a few days now and while we are talking, she is being very cold and makes passive aggressive remarks about it, including the lack of apology. I spoke to my sister and she said she understood where I was coming from but also I could have just booked us both in and made the day more pleasant.

But next time don't let it get that far, speak out earlier. And this is a lesson for you, you are clearly not a priority for her. \n\nNTA.

Your life does not stop because she has an appointment. You are absolutely free to spend that time anyway you choose.

I feel like she likes you being the friend that \"holds her purse while she shops\" but is resentful of the fact that you didn't let her appointment spoil your day.

It is not like you were plotting a scheme to take over the world.  How you spend your time is your business.\n\nYour sister's suggestion is not wrong, but from what I gathered, your spa started during your friend's appointment, so her suggestion would not work.\n\nAnd maybe your suspicion is right, your friend is taking advantage of you as a driver.

You could have told her before \"while your at your appointment I'm going to go to xyz spa, you should book yourself in for the end of your appointment, we can do abc treatment togeather before lunch\" and none of this would be a problem- but you wanted to be petty and now can't even pull up your big girl pants and apologize.

OP never said they intended to hide the spa or tried to be petty. They just found an activity to keep themselves busy while the friend rudely expected her to wait, after already delaying confirmation on dates. OP did nothing wrong. They were in London and made a plan. If the friend cared to share in an activity, they should have asked OP about their plans.

(Her previous appointments usually took 2 hours). \n\nSo there wouldn't have been any time that she could have joined in the Spa.

Either way, if the friend really cared to spend the whole day together, they would have planned a whole day. They didn't and gave scraps to OP. Petty or not (which again, you're assuming), OP doesn't have to tell anyone what she does with her free time. So clearly she's not the AH.
