They discussed it with the family and everyone agreed except my cousin's wife(Tanya,30) she told A and SIL that they are being \"cheap\" even though they both have high-paying jobs. My aunt (Carol) cousin's mom(Tanya's MIL) explained to her that it's not just about reducing expenses but also a consideration for our relatives that will attend the event because some of them are living in another city or out of the country, but Tanya just rolled her eyes and left. ( My cousin was in the military so he was not present when all of this happened)\n\nTanya **hates** SIL with passion, the reason is SIL was supposed to be one of Tanya's bride's maids but due to SIL's work, she has to leave Tanya's wedding. SIL explained and apologizes to Tanya before leaving and Tanya tells SIL that it was fine. It's not fine. After the wedding, Tanya didn't invite SIL to any of her plans, she always said that she forgot or she thought she was busy as an excuse but SIL didn't take it personally. Cut to my brother and SIL's wedding, Tanya decided not to attend the wedding at the last minute because she doesn't like the dress SHE bought HERSELF and she wanted the MOH's gown instead (I'm the MOH).\n\nMy mom told her no because everything is already set up. Like a toddler Tanya stomped her feet and run out of the venue, Carol apologizes to SIL while mom and SIL's mom were calming SIL down as she was panicking because the wedding was about to start. The wedding proceeded beautifully, SIL was stunning, we made fun of my brother for crying, and everything is just perfect. **Until the reception**. We thought Tanya has gone home after causing a commotion but that's not the case. We got to the reception only to find Tanya in a bikini and drunk af. Carol got a towel to cover Tanya but she pushed Carol causing her to fall. Tanya then proceeds to rant about how SIL ruined everything, her wedding, her life, blah blah blah. Then pulled my brother and tried to kiss him, good thing my brother pushed Tanya away before she kiss him. Everyone was appalled by Tanya's action.\n\nEverything was a mess, SIL sobbing, my brother trying to calm everything down, Carol apologizing profusely and the guests just stood there shocked and frozen. I was fuming mad at this point, so I dragged Tanya out of the venue, locked her in a room, and called the police to get her detained.\n\nI may be the  Ahole for calling the cops on her because my other relatives are telling me that I have gone too far calling the cops over some family matter and it's not even my wedding, to begin with. SIL, her family, and my family said that I did the right thing. So  IATA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: when the cops came they just issued a warning. That's it.  And Carol told my cousin what his wife did.

Don't assault pregnant people. They don't have great balance and falling wrong can kill the pregnancy."]}
