The state that we go to school in has a full ride scholarship (incl books, room and board, a MacBook, etc) that  each state representative chooses a student from their district to receive. I am an out of state student so this doesn\u2019t personally affect me. Sarah\u2019s dad is good friends with her districts rep, and she was selected to start receiving the scholarship after the last recipient graduated this May. \n\nThis left a bad taste in my mouth for a couple reasons. Sarah\u2019s family is very wealthy, her dad makes somewhere in the low 7 figures annually. She grew up going to an expensive private school and her family has been comfortably paying essentially her college tuition annually for the last 12 years already. She is also very religious. Although I don\u2019t always agree with some of her beliefs, one of the points I used to really respect her for was that she claimed her faith inspired her to give back and volunteer. Her family honestly does donate a lot to charity and she volunteers more than anyone I know. \n\nWhen she excitedly told me that she was selected for the scholarship she could tell I was upset and asked why I wasn\u2019t happy for her. I told her that I thought it was kind of selfish for her to accept it, when the only reason she received it in the first place is because her rich dad knows the rep personally. The district she\u2019s from has some of the poorest communities in our state and there\u2019s hundreds of students where this scholarship would make or break their ability to go to college at all. Instead, her dad gets to buy another boat with all the money he saved. She kept defending herself, and how hard her dad works so I finally said \u201cI just don\u2019t think accepting it when you really didn\u2019t need it and didn\u2019t earn it on merit is very Christian\u201d \n\nShe called me an asshole and who am I to tell her what is or isn\u2019t Christian and left. I still don\u2019t believe I\u2019m an asshole but people in our circle are telling me to apologize to keep the peace.\n\nEDIT:\nTo answer the ppl that are asking why I know the only reason she received it was because of her dads connections. She told me that the rep reached out personally to her dad to ask if she would accept it. I\u2019m also friends with another person in her district and they confirmed that there was no option to enter for consideration to receive the scholarship. The previous person was also the son of one of the reps friends.\n\nHer parents are fully paying for her tuition plus an allowance for her other expenses.\n\nEDIT 2: Didn\u2019t think I would have to say this but bc ppl are getting really personal, we both go to a very expensive private college. My parents are middle class and the only reason I was able to go to this school is because of a very sizable merit scholarship.

And in this particular case it does seem hypocritical on your friends part. However, she could be thinking in a practical way about the whole matter as you mentioned that the process for getting the scholarship has been incredibly shady from the very start so maybe she thought that even if she refused the scholarship would probably go to some other rich kid whose dad is friends with the rep.

It sounds like jealousy to me personally. \n\nIt also sounds illegal if it\u2019s happening as you say. Like who funds the scholarship?

So many friendships in my 20s got heavy rocked by this because everyone is jumping into the rat race.\n\nIf someone handed you a scholarship you didn\u2019t totally need would you use it? Would you want your friends to be happy for you if you ever \u201clucked out\u201d (ie had any lucky breaks you didn\u2019t totally work for)? \n\nPeople get lucky sometimes and people have privilege. It\u2019s annoying but to expect her to give up a scholarship to virtue signal is a stretch. Did you actually want her to not take it? Wouldn\u2019t it go to some other rich persons kid if it\u2019s as rigged as you say it is? Did you just want her to feel guilty about it? Give you some money?\n\nIf you react like this to rich people (jealousy) then you should only cultivate middle class friends. It\u2019s a huge stretch for you to think she would have given that up, and it was normal for her to call you out for it I think. It just seems like a weird and controlling demand. \n\nI\u2019m not a Christian but manipulating people under the guise of religious values is sometimes considered spiritual abuse. If you don\u2019t like how she lives simply float away and make new friends, you don\u2019t need to tell her you\u2019re mad she was born wealthier and with more privileges and lucky breaks than you. That\u2019s probably not going to solve anything. \n\nI know this is harsh, and you\u2019re young too, but it just seems like such a strange and sad thing to tell someone to not use a scholarship they were offered and make them feel bad about it. I also agree with others that it\u2019s possible you don\u2019t actually know how rigged that scholarship program is, if you truely do, again I encourage you to tell investigative reporters giving solid evidence of this if it\u2019s an illegal activity which it may be.\n\nI\u2019d be far more worried about some weird illegal lobbying scheme with rich families using their reps via perks like this than whether or not your 19 year old friend enjoys and uses some extra money that was given to her. I\u2019d be on the case of the parent and the rep if it\u2019s that corrupt not guilt tripping her.

I don't. It would go to another privileged kid with a wealthy family.\n\nIf you feel strongly about this, instead of badgering your friend to refuse it, do some homework and find out whether the system is being abused and whether the rep is actually allowed to dish the scholarship out with no regard for whether the recipient's circumstances.\n\nAlso, you may want to apologise for your heated reaction, since technically she didn't do anything wrong.

The state that we go to school in has a full ride scholarship (incl books, room and board, a MacBook, etc) that  each state representative chooses a student from their district to receive. I am an out of state student so this doesn\u2019t personally affect me. Sarah\u2019s dad is good friends with her districts rep, and she was selected to start receiving the scholarship after the last recipient graduated this May. This left a bad taste in my mouth for a couple reasons. \nSarah\u2019s family is very wealthy, her dad makes somewhere in the low 7 figures annually. She grew up going to an expensive private school and her family has been comfortably paying essentially her college tuition annually for the last 12 years already. She is also very religious.Although I don\u2019t always agree with some of her beliefs, one of the points I used to really respect her for was that she claimed her faith inspired her to give back and volunteer. Her family honestly does donate a lot to charity and she volunteers more than anyone I know. \nWhen she excitedly told me that she was selected for the scholarship she could tell I was upset and asked why I wasn\u2019t happy for her. I told her that I thought it was kind of selfish for her to accept it, when the only reason she received it in the first place is because her rich dad knows the rep personally. The district she\u2019s from has some of the poorest communities in our state and there\u2019s hundreds of students where this scholarship would make or break their ability to go to college at all. Instead, her dad gets to buy another boat with all the money he saved. She kept defending herself, and how hard her dad works so I finally said \u201cI just don\u2019t think accepting it when you really didn\u2019t need it and didn\u2019t earn it on merit is very Christian\u201d \nShe called me an asshole and who am I to tell her what is or isn\u2019t Christian and left. I still don\u2019t believe I\u2019m an asshole but people in our circle are telling me to apologize to keep the peace.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Can I ask a question? A full ride scholarship is an American thing obviously. I'm British.  Reading this it appears 'full ride' doesn't include tuition.  Is that correct?  Is there such a thing as a completely full ride, ie including tuition?", "I think this is NAH. You\u2019re not technically wrong about how she got it, but there are better ways that you could deal with this. You are wrong in thinking that Sarah is getting the scholarship instead of an underprivileged student; as you describe it, there\u2019s no way to apply so the only way to get it is connections. If Sarah didn\u2019t get the scholarship some other well-connected and probably rich kid would. It isn\u2019t a merit scholarship, so unless she\u2019s acting like it is, there\u2019s no need to cut at her about it. So she\u2019s not an AH for being excited or for accepting the scholarship, as long as she doesn\u2019t act like it\u2019s the same accomplishment as your merit scholarship. I won\u2019t call you an AH for being annoyed at the situation though.\n\nWould it be better if these representatives looked for kids who needed a leg up rather than just giving it to their buddies\u2019 kids? Certainly, and you\u2019re not wrong that this scholarship is very biased. Maybe you could encourage Sarah to think about others more, about helping others make connections and especially about the poor kids in her district. But that particular scholarship is going to go to some rich kid, because that\u2019s how her representative does things, so her turning it down won\u2019t really help anyone.

This is crony capitalism, ie, corruption.\n\nVery illegal in every state except Florida. (This is a joke, but really Florida, you are so corrupt).\n\nAnyway, give a little search to \"investigative journalist (your state)\" and find someone who has written articles about that representative before. It will be helpful to have the name of the previous scholarship recipient.\n\nIt's not a small deal. This is at least 200k of favor. She should be ashamed, but more importantly, that representative should be brought to account.", "NTA\n\nYou pointed out that her state rep is corrupt and only awarded her the scholarship because of the corruption.\n\nScholarships are suppose to be for standout students, be it in athletics or scholastic achievement. The aren't suppose to be handed out to the children of your millionaire friends.", "YTA.\n\nShe's 19. She is not the problem. Even if she didn't accept it, the scholarship is not going to a poor kid. If you really feel this is a massive injustice, the correct thing to do is contact a reporter or someone who oversees the program. Not tell your friend she isn't very Christian (that's such a stupid thing to say, especially if you're not Christian or a non-practicing Christian).\n\nIt's very clear you're envious of her life. That's understandable. But if you can't handle being in proximity of rich people (even rich people like her who, according to you, are great volunteers and give to charity), just fade away. This life is not meant for you. \n\nBut you have an opportunity to leverage your own privilege of getting a rich, connected roommate, and you are squandering it. If you stayed good friends with her, got to know her family, etc., who knows what benefits you could have reaped (job recommendations, invitations to nice vacations, etc.). Sometimes, it's not 100% merit-based, and who you know is a factor. It's just the reality of the world, and you should do what you can to take advantage of it while you have a chance.", "Gently, YTA. I probably would have felt the same in college. But she did not ask for the scholarship and likely has no say in how her parents pay for her education. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ethical of the state rep to not have an application process or for her father to effectively accept it by proxy, but you don\u2019t know what the consequences would have been if she asked to reject it. Her father might not have been willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars after she rejected it.", "NTA. The scholarship is a racket and the state rep is a crook. You should expose this by telling the local media. It's not personal, and though your friend has personally chosen to accept it, the money would just be used on another person that would further the rep's personal interests if she refused: it really isn't about her. You have now discovered corruption and have a duty to do something about it.", "If your edit is accurate and there was zero chance she would\u2019ve gotten the scholarship without her dad\u2019s connections, then I\u2019d say NTA for bringing that point up specifically. Talking about her religion in an effort to guilt her into giving up a great opportunity, earned or not, is making you a bit of an asshole though. \n\nBut I hope you\u2019re going on more than just hearsay. Because if there\u2019s even a possibility that she got the scholarship for her grades or community outreach and what not, then you\u2019d be an asshole. \n\nI grew up dirt poor and received a full-ride due to my grades. My husband grew up extremely poor, but then his parents became millionaires when he was about 15/16. He also got a full-ride due to his grades and things he and his parents did for the community. I\u2019d never tell him he didn\u2019t deserve it just because his family has money. Was he afforded opportunities to boost his application that many others aren\u2019t? Absolutely. But it doesn\u2019t make him any less deserving, even if people feel a little bitter about it (which is also understandable). \n\nAs someone who isn\u2019t Christian, I also don\u2019t think it makes her any less Christian to accept help when it\u2019s offered. You already said she and her family give back to the community and donate to charities. Being a good Christian shouldn\u2019t mean giving absolutely everything up. She still has to think about her future and take care of herself and her potential future family. \n\nJust offering a different perspective. I think you\u2019re entitled to your feelings, but you\u2019re not entitled in telling her what she can or can\u2019t do with her money or her life. And shaming her for it is a bit gross. You\u2019re both kids. She doesn\u2019t have life figured out. Your lives are just beginning.

Even in the sketchy states this kind of corruption wouldn\u2019t be able to hide.", "Don\u2019t want to dox myself but will say that our state is not exactly known for its legislature responsible spending, this wouldn\u2019t be that crazy compared to other stuff that politicians have gotten in trouble for here already", "Wow, I did not know that!\n\n\nBut I guess I was mostly referring to the scholarships that are listed on the official school websites (like the ones your school advisor encourages you to apply if your GPA is high enough, or if you did tons of services for school/community)", "Well crap I wish I had known about the read head one 16 years ago \ud83e\udd72\ud83d\ude05", "Lots of small ones out there just as contest prizes too. I reviewed essays for a $3,000 scholarship that was based solely and entirely on the essay.

Pretty certain no one handed Dad a wad of cash & said it was a scholarship. \n\nAll scholarships have criteria (need, merit) & can be reported if it\u2019s questionable. If Sarah did nothing for the scholarship then potentially she received it fraudulently. Report her...", "I think you\u2019re talking about the Full House woman.... that was a college admissions scheme.

Not with the case of OP they sound like the AH to me but the larger issue is was this a bribe for lobbying reps under the table?

You can do your best to be a good person, but seriously, I'm surprised you can't recognize the scandal in this situation. It's absurd.", "I think this is a very naive take. There are plenty of instances where politicians cheat the system to benefit their network and donors and easily get away with it. If every politician was properly held accountable for fraudulent behavior then our political and economic system would be much different. Yes, sometimes they are prosecuted or held accountable but it usually isn\u2019t until years after the fact and maybe this rep hasn\u2019t had their day of reckoning yet.

Read her entire post and all the other comments OP has made. It's a scandal in Sarah's town. You wouldn't be outraged at a scholarship created by public funds going to a rich kid who is friends with the politician responsible for giving out the scholarship? Do you not live in the world? Most of America isn't merit based. That is a myth and a fantasy. It's based on who you know.", "I mean, both? Like it's absolutely corruption, and that representative should be removed at the very least. But her friend also knows this scholarship would make literally no difference to her (her parents are multi millionaires who are already having no trouble paying for college), knows it is blatant corruption and abuse of public funds, and knows it could be better used to help someone who otherwise can't go to college. \n\nThe level of greed and apathy for other people that takes is astonishing, and i wouldn't be friends with someone willing to do that", ">Weehhh my friend has something I don\u2019t have not fair \n\nLiterally said in the post they can't be eligible for the scholarship as they're from out of state, and already have their own. \n\nNone of what was said was about op being jealous, where are you getting that from?

The district she\u2019s from has some of the poorest communities in our state and there\u2019s hundreds of students where this scholarship would make or break their ability to go to college at all.
