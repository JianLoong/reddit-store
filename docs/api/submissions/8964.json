She\u2019s somewhat right because of my older brothers made it worse (maybe another post). She constantly reminded us as kids that we would be on the streets if it weren\u2019t for her and that her, and her only, would only love us. My sisters got most of the verbal abuse from her and they\u2019ve both been distant from our family (especially our mother) for quite a while. They only come around because she\u2019s getting old and they want their kids to know their grandma since we never met ours (both of grandparents from each side died trying to escape the vietnam war or in a refugee camp). \n- My mom knows why my wife wasn\u2019t there.

She needs to respect you and the basic conditions you set for her.  I won\u2019t tell you what to do, but I would start pulling back from contact.

Please listen to me when I tell you something bothers me and please respect me as a person The same way I respect you. \n\n2) The disrespectful one is: I wish you would\u2019ve reconsidered  your decision to have children if you\u2019re going to hold it over my head all the time that you gave me life. You had children to please yourself, your husband and your in-laws but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to give up my choices, comfort or dreams to please you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She is your mother and you feel some sort of obligation to let your kids know her. Your mother has shown you who she is throughout your life. She is an abusing narcissist who respects no one but herself. I personally don't understand the need to subject yourself and your kids to her brand of 'family', but you do. Your call. But when she continually ignores your requests,  lies to your face,  then angrily blames you for her actions, you have every right to refuse to be further abused. Protect yourself and your family from her toxicity. Refuse to visit. If your brothers don't agree, tell them it's your decision and they should respect it even if they don't agree. I wish you all the best.", "It's easy for your older brothers to disagree with you.  They didn't have to do any of the work!", "NTA, but you're stuck with your mother on the other side of a cultural divide. As long as you and your sibs are acting as family, this is how it will work. You're not an a-h unless you really expect to change things. The status quo benefits your mother and brothers and that won't change.", "[removed]", "No grandma is better than a toxic grandma.

She loves pushing buttons. Stop listening to what she says. Her actions tell you what her opinion is of you and your sisters. She will continue to disrepect you. Your choice is to put up with it or go no contact or low contact.", "NTA. Did your older brothers do anything other than sit on their asses while you and your sisters cooked? Have they ever helped? If not, they can go kick rocks. I say you and your sisters get together from now on. Let your older brothers deal with your mom.", "NTA. It's bad enough she thinks it is okay to invite one person without telling you but she invited 20+ people without telling you. Wtf? How does she think this is even acceptable? You supposedly make her look bad? What do the other relatives think of you and your sisters when they think they were invited and there is barely any food for them? There was food for 11 people, not 30+ people. Even if you made a bit more, that's still not enough. Also, if she is not contributing financially to those dinners where she invites so many people, she certainly should.\nShe is being ridiculous and should only invite people to her own house. Your brothers are AHs too if they take her side when they seem to not help with the cooking and cleaning up.", "NTA. Full grown adults playing victim when its time to take accounrability is disgusting. You also told her you wanted a small celebration and ignoring your wishes and responding with \"you shouldve cooked more if you knew I was going to do this\" is childish", ">Also your mam sounds lazy and entitled.\n\nThe brothers too! They can disagree all they want when they get off their butts & cook for 30+ people.", "I just say i didnt ask to be here lol", "I absolutely fuckin love this!
