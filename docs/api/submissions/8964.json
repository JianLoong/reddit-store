She does it nearly every Christmas and Thanksgiving when we directly tell her not to. \n\nLast weekend, we had a dinner celebraton for my older brother. We verbally told our mother that we want to just make it small for our family so that we don\u2019t have to cook so much since all of us are so busy now. She said yes, it would be just us. My two sisters (31 & 32) and I, (24) cooked for our family of 11 (parents, siblings, nieces/nephews). Once we finished cooking and started prepping the table, my little cousin popped out of nowhere and surprised me. I went outside and saw my two uncles (family of 5 & family of 6), my aunt (family of 6) and two of my cousins (couple & family of 4) in our front yard. I ran back inside and told my sisters and they literally dropped everything and just left because we hadn\u2019t cook enough for that many people. \n\nMy two sisters left together to go eat at a resturant taking some of their kids and left one with me that wanted to stay. My mother berated them on their way out and in front of our relatives saying how ungrateful and \u201cbad women\u201d they were\u2014very awkward and embarassing of course. My cousin (couple) left as well. Everyone at the table barely had a full plate and I chose not to eat with the rest of the men to allow the kids and my daughter to eat. \n\nAfterwards when mother and I were cleaning (none of my brothers were helping), I talked about how embarassing it was that she shouldn\u2019t had put us in that situation and her response ticked me off\u2026 in our native tongue she says, \u201cIf you knew I was going to invite them, then why didn\u2019t you just cook more then?\u201d and blamed my wife for not helping. I told her that if she wants to keep having a relationship with some of us, especially my sisters, then she has to stop that crap otherwise some of us won\u2019t be showing up anymore. She started crying and said that she couldn\u2019t believe that we were so cruel and reminded me again, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for me\u201d.  I got very, very angry because i felt like I was a kid again hearing that and i hated hearing that as kid. I told her that if she ever says that again then I would never let her see me, my wife, or my daughter again. I didn\u2019t want her to see me get teary-eyed and so I grabbed my daughter and just left.

I remember a lot of their arguments and I always felt bad for my sisters. Also because they practically raised me too (baby of the family). \n- My mother, not my father, used to beat us with belts and bamboo sticks. Thankfully, i only got to experience that once because I didn\u2019t want to cut my hair. \n- My mother often blamed us for their divorce because we weren\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d children. She\u2019s somewhat right because of my older brothers made it worse (maybe another post). She constantly reminded us as kids that we would be on the streets if it weren\u2019t for her and that her, and her only, would only love us. My sisters got most of the verbal abuse from her and they\u2019ve both been distant from our family (especially our mother) for quite a while. They only come around because she\u2019s getting old and they want their kids to know their grandma since we never met ours (both of grandparents from each side died trying to escape the vietnam war or in a refugee camp). \n- My mom knows why my wife wasn\u2019t there. We told her weeks ahead of time that she was going to be traveling for work.", "NTA. Your mother is a textbook narcissist. \n\nMake your threat a reality and cut her off your life. You'll feel much better. \n\nKudos to your sisters for up and leaving when she pulled her crap again.

She could have turned off those tears like flipping a switch if she wanted.", "NTA. I don't blame your sisters at all for leaving. That's absolutely unacceptable that she put you guys through that. You didn't make enough food, and your whole family is there so you were put in a terrible situation. It sucks having to turn away family because you end up looking like the bad guy. Your mother has big entitlement issues and she refuses to see the err of her ways somehow.", "NTA You were clear with your expectations and she violated them intentionally. She wants to control everything. The advice you gave her was good anyway", "NTA. Stick to your guns my friend and I hope it gets better.", "NTA, you do not owe your sanity to anybody. This reminds me of some of my family and it's not cool, being an immigrant parent that struggled doesn't mean you and your siblings are indebted to her so thoroughly she can do and say whatever she wants.\n\nYou are your own person.", "NTA.  Growing up my mom always had to tell her mom and sister to come to show up at least two hours earlier than she actually needed because they were perpetually extremely late for family dinners and events.  In hindsight she shouldn\u2019t have had to do that.  The same goes for you here.  You set a boundary, double checked that she understood, and she still let you down.  And holding your own birth over your head like you owe her something when clearly you and your siblings love and care for her and the family as a whole.  She needs to respect you and the basic conditions you set for her.  I won\u2019t tell you what to do, but I would start pulling back from contact.  Creating a bit of distance between her and her grandkid may make her at least realize you\u2019re serious.  It\u2019s unfortunate, but sometimes our parents can\u2019t be the people we with they could be, but that isn\u2019t your fault.", "NTA. Your brothers did not cook nor clean, so they have no say in this dispute unless they step up. You mother put you in a ridiculous and embarrassing situation that could easily have been avoided.", "NTA. Maybe letting go the relationship with her wouldn't be that bad. She was like that all your life, as much as you'd want it, she won't stop now. She will do the same things and try to guilt you into forgiving her time and time again. She seems to view your sisters and women in general as less than men whose job is to be subservient to men, but most of all to her. It's what makes sense to her, as I assume she was raised similarly. For the sake of your daughter, you might want to reconsider if you want your mother around her or not.", "Your sisters and you are not ass holes at all. stick to your guns", "Holy shit...if I were cooking for *eleven* people, and 24 MORE PEOPLE showed up (is my math right?), I would be so pissed AND stressed.

If you were making a big pot of stew, everyone would get a CUP. \n\nAnd your mother isn't *embarrassed* that no one got a full tummy? The cooks in my family would die of embarrassment. \n\nI'd have done exactly what you did, OP. Who the hell invites 20ish extra people knowing there will not be enough to go around? \n\nI'd also have tossed her a takeout menu and told her the wait time might be long for a couple dozen people. \n\nNTA. But there's having the patience of a saint, and being a doormat.", "NTA your mum knew the boundary, she broke it and was nasty.

You and your sisters should seriously consider going LC with her for the sake of your own peace of mind and self-respect.", "NTA. Your mother got caught in her lies and paid for it by being embarrassed in front of her relatives.  My guess is that it will be a long time, if ever, that your sisters agree to an event at your mother's house.", "I went to therapy in college and my therapist said that too.

My ethnicity is Hmong so despite being born and raised in the states, we do retain some gender tasks. \n\nIt\u2019s a little saddening hearing everyone\u2019s posts including yours because what everyone is saying is true and I realize now that I must be in denial of my mother\u2019s intentions.

If there's never enough food, hasn't she realized it by now? Doesn't she care that she invites people to eat and then leaves them hungry?

If anyone uninvited shows up, they get met at the door with an \"oh my goodness, I'm so sorry for the confusion, I don't know who told you to come but you weren't invited. There's only enough space and food for the people we planned on.\" And if even that won't work, still host it elsewhere but tell Mum it's going to be the day AFTER it really is.
