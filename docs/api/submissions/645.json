In her family cooking is a big deal with all of the women in the kitchen (I know and have offered help, don't come for me) and they all take part and socialize while doing it.\n\nIn my family my mom does most of the cooking. My sisters might wander in and out and help, her husband might chop some vegetables, but it is really mainly her. Her MIL stays in the kitchen with her but apparently doesn't know how to cook, or sometimes she has a friend in there. We've offered my mom help and she has politely turned it down.\n\nRosie has been trying to get more involved for the past couple holidays and my mom has snubbed her. Rosie confided in me that she is getting frustrated and feels that she is going to be a member of the family and has the right to be included. I talked to my mom and she suggested Rosie bring a dish and they can reheat and serve it.\n\nAt this point Rosie felt like she was being totally snubbed. I talked to my mom again and she confided in me that she finds Rosie annoying and doesn't want to be forced to spend that much time with her, and it would \"ruin\" her holidays. She said I \"can't\" get mad at her as she has never tried to break us up or even said anything, but I also shouldn't be forcing Rosie on her.\n\nI was furious. I always felt like my mom wasn't crazy about her and borderline cold sometimes, but I couldn't believe she would just admit it like that, and that she is snubbing Rosie during family holidays because of her personal feelings. I told my mom I was disappointed in her for being selfish and immature. I talked to Rosie and we decided we can no longer spend holidays with my family. My mom called me pathetic and said I obviously want a fake relationship if she can't even tell me how she feels. Everyone else in the family texted me pretty much all telling me that I am a huge asshole.", "created_utc": 1667073458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygt4ri/aita_for_saying_i_wont_spend_holidays_with_my/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You say no other member of the family helps your mother in cooking, so how is Rosie being snubbed?\n\nShe's wrong to try to force her way into the situation on the pretext of being \"family.\" Family members respect each other. Your mother's made it clear she doesn't want outside help. Your fiance shouldn't force the situation. Now, if other members were helping and yr mother told her no, that would be snubbing. But she isn't. So she's not.\n\nYou're lucky your mother had the confidence in you to tell you her feelings for Rosie, though I'm sure you didn't like hearing it. Your mother wasn't being selfish or immature. She just doesn't like Rosie. People have the right to not like someone, even if they're perfectly nice people otherwise.\n\nI think you're being a bit petty by not going at all. Though if you do start going again, you should have a \"pre-meet\" on another day, to clear the air.", "YTA You pushed for an answer and you got upset at the truth. Being a member of the family doesn't mean that it's ok to force yourself on others. It's not just about feelings, it's about personal boundaries. \n\nRosie can contribute, but she can't decide that she has to be in your mom's personal space against her will on a yearly basis and ruin a holiday for her. She at least compromised by telling Rosie to bring a dish. You should have accepted that instead of going nuclear. Not everyone likes everyone, that's ok, but forcing people on people never is. \n\nYour mom clearly respects the relationship, but you don't respect her space. Your mom has a certain way she likes to cook around the holidays and likes her personal space being respected, respect that, it's her home and it's her space, you can't make rules about who gets to be in her personal orbit around the holidays.\n\nEdit to add: It's pretty obvious why mom doesn't like Rosie. Mom prefers cooking alone and too many people \"helping\" means too many people to babysit and distract her from cooking. If you can respect how Rosie's family does things, then you can at least respect how your own family does things.\n\nI absolutely hate people \"helping\" while I cook because, if I have to tell someone where something is, or they're constantly in my direct way, then they're being a detriment and a distraction. The most I'll accept is grabbing me eggs or opening containers for me, but not the actual cooking.", "YTA. Different families have different styles, and not everyone likes to cook as a team. My dad's a superb cook, but getting in his way while he's focused on cooking is Not Recommended. (This is why my sister and I do what your mom suggested and bring to Thanksgiving premade dishes that only need heating up, or in the case of my cranberry relish just putting into a serving dish. I highly recommend that strategy, as it lets us contribute without getting in the way.)", "YTA. Dude your moms trying. She\u2019s not being a crazy MIL that tries to break you up. Her mental health matters too. She should not have to deal with a pushy GF insisting on being in her sanctuary(in this case her kitchen). Your GF needs to respect your moms personal space.", "Rosie is the AH. Rosie needs to find something else to do. Just because something is done a certain way in her family doesn\u2019t mean she can push that on to others. Stop trying to pry her way in where she isn\u2019t wanted. That would make anyone annoyed with her. It\u2019s your moms house, then it\u2019s your moms rules. Respect that.", "YTA\n\nYour mom isn't \"snubbing\" fiance. Things are done differently in your family. Your fiance should get that. No one else is cooking either. Your mom is hosting the event, it is her decision.\n\nIn this case, it is actually selfish of your fiance to try to push in to your mom's cooking.", "This story sounds pretty familiar. YTA. I think suggesting Rosie bring a dish to reheat was an okay compromise.", "Yep, YTA.\n\nYour mother hasn't been immature AT ALL. You and GF on the other hand... You're mother has the right to dislike your GF. And your GF has no right to push HER traditions onto your family. You too are stepping on many boundaries.", "Yta. If your mom wants to cook by herself that\u2019s her choice. She isn\u2019t specifically excluding just your fianc\u00e9 and letting others help. Your fianc\u00e9 sounds annoying", "YTA. Rosie is an acquired taste and you know it. You pressed your mom for an answer and she gave you one. It just wasn't the one you wanted. \n\nI should also note that response came AFTER she politely turned you down. Leave it alone.", "YTA. \n\nHere\u2019s the deal: Your mother has been polite and respectful by not telling you her true feelings. \n\nYou are being an immature AH by punishing her for being polite and respectful. So she doesn\u2019t want her in the kitchen. Grow up and get the fuck over yourselves. Your mother isn\u2019t obligated to have her in there and she isn\u2019t being rude to anyone. \n\nIf you need to figure out who is being rude here, look in a mirror.", "yta - oh boy why did you need to open pandoras box... you had a situation where it was clear your mother was not fond of you girlfriend. you knew it.. and still you decided to poke the sleeping tiger with a stick... and now you complain you got bitten...", "YTA and you shouldn't be forcing your girlfriend on your mom or giving ultimatums. Want your girlfriend to really not feel part of the family and 100% treated as such here on out...then do exactly what you just did. Your mother does the cooking in the household and that's how she likes it. That should have been enough of an answer for yall. Bringing a dish was a good compromise as well. Yall need to respect that. Or like you said stop being part of your family's holidays. But yeah you do need to grow up and are the AH", "Your family is correct \n\nYTA. Your mom isn't someone who wants the help in the kitchen. That's fine. Your fiancee should respect that, not push and push until she gives in. That's why she finds her annoying. Because she cant take no for an answer and instead tries to force you to force your mom to say yes. \n\nCome on dude, grow a spine.", "YTA. First off because Rosie does sound really annoying, she doesn\u2019t get to just decide that other families should behave the same way hers does. Second because you asked your mom and got mad at her answer, don\u2019t ask if you don\u2019t want the truth. Third for calling other people selfish and immature when the only people being selfish and immature are you and Rosie.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to be mad at people for not catering to your bossy, irritating gf.", "YTA", "YTA, letting your girlfriend dictate how your mother behaves in her own home and attempting to force herself in where she's not needed or wanted is despicable.", "YTA.\n\nRosie doesn\u2019t have a \u201cright\u201d to cook with your mother.\n\nJust because Rosie\u2019s family all cooks together doesn\u2019t mean your mother needs to do the same. She likes cooking on her own which is clear since no one really helps her, and also since she does it mostly alone Rosie isn\u2019t being left out of anything.\n\nYou would rather ruin your relationship with your entire family then just tell Rosie no. Good luck with that.", "YTA. Rosie and her family have their traditions so why can't your mother? She obviously enjoys what she is doing and you have no right to shove what Rosie wants down her throat.", "You demanded your mom let someone in her kitchen and then got mad at her for saying no? Just because rosie cooks at her house doesn't mean she has to cook at your moms. Geez I can see why your mom doesn't like her if she's demanding she be allowed to cook\n\nYTA", "YTA - I\u2019d be annoyed if I were your mom. It\u2019s weird that your fianc\u00e9e won\u2019t back off", "Honestly I think your mother communicated her wishes and needs like an adult, she is under enough stress preparing the food for holiday season and you want to force your fiance on her, because your fiance loves cooking?\n\nCool, but not your kitchen.\n\nYour mother likes doing things her way in her house, she keeps it cordial with your fiance, she offered a compromise - she is not absolutely over the moon with your fiance - but she's also not gonna marry her.\n\nYou and your future wife should try to grow up a little, and respect the hosts house rules.\n\nYTA (and Rosie if she thinks forcing her way into your mum's kitchen is going to suddenly improve their relationship)", "YTA\n\nYour mother isn't snubbing her GF. It isn't like everyone is joining your mother in the kitchen. She is doing it herself, which is the way she likes it. \n\nYour GF needs to understand that she can't march into someone's else house and demand things done her way. She needs to adhere to what the  host wants. it isn't a personal attack", "YTA!", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur mom is reasonable, you are not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRosie is an entitled AH, and a shitty guest.", "Not sure why you and your SO can't just relax and just eat!\n\nIt's not a contest!\n\nIt's your mom's home and her invitation. \nShe gets to set the reasonable expectations. \n\nIs this really the hill you want to die on, over food??\n\nIt seems super silly.", "YTA \n\nI cannot imagine how much work it is going to be in the future when you and Rosie have legit problems... you are in for a Rollercoaster of BS", "OP, when I go to my IL's houses on holidays, I always offer help.  However, if my MIL or SIL say they're all set, I ACCEPT IT LIKE AN ADULT.\n\nRosie needs to grow TF up, and apparently so do you.\n\nYTA and so is Rosie.", "How is it that Rosie's family traditions are great but your mom's traditions are unacceptable? Your mom is *consistently* on the too many cooks in the kitchen theory so much so that your family (and extended family) understand and respect it except you and Rosie. All of this in your mom's home.\n\nSomebody please make this make sense.\n\nOh and yes, you and Rosie are YTA.", "YTA & so is Rosie. You pushed until you got an excuse to issue an ultimatum. I\u2019m not big on wanting people in my kitchen either, especially if it\u2019s someone I only tolerate for the sake of someone I love.", "YTA. Rosie has no right to force her way into your mum's kitchen and your mum was perfectly reasonable explaining that she isn't a fan but making it clear that she's not asking for you to split up or anything. You can't be mad at someone for not liking a person. The only people being rude here are Rosie and you.", "You and Rosie are the AH.", "YTA\n\nThis is weird, man.  Your mom didn't want help.  Rosie kept trying to force her way in.  And then, when your mom said \"hey, it's annoying when she does that\" you get butthurt, tell her, and then refuse to come to the holidays.\n\nYour family is right, and you need to figure your shit out", "Yta you\u2019re literally trying to force her to interact with someone she doesn\u2019t wanna be around she\u2019s civil and polite what else do you want stop pushing the issue before there is an issue", "YTA. What rosie does at her family house, is her thing. Don't expect that at your parents house. And your mom is already being nice by not saying anything for so long. Just because YOU love Rosie doesn't mean your family does. They simply love you so much that they tolerate her.", "YTA for sure. Nobody has to let other people help them cook just because they want to - it\u2019s not like she\u2019s letting everyone but her, she just wants to cook on her own. And yeah, her not liking Rosie is valid and she can tell you that honestly if that\u2019s how she feels. Is she just supposed to hide her feelings forever? Your family is honestly better off without you there if you\u2019re gonna treat them like that.", "Yta. Tell your gf to stop trying to force her family's holiday style/traditions on your mother.  She handled it very diplomatically. You didn't even know that she didn't like your girlfriend until you pushed and asked her for a reason.  Don't ask a question that you don't want the answer to.  Maybe part of the reason your mother doesn't like her is because she's so pushy. When there is already a tradition in place it is very annoying for the newcomer to come and tell you how to do things.\n\n\n Rosie needs to find her lane and it's not in the kitchen.", "YTA. Sorry but your mum isn't obligated to like your fiancee. She has tried to accommodate her in a way that she thought would work by suggesting bringing a dish but that wasn't good enough for you or Rosie. So you pushed and pushed and then got an answer you didn't like, even though you say you suspected that to be the case.\n\nYou sound a bit childish to me. How do you think things will pan out if your mother allows Rosie to help (while still not accepting help from anyone else in the family - just Rosie because...reasons) and things go south and they argue? Would that make you happy? To finally f- up the family Christmas because you couldn't leave it alone.\n\nMaybe have every other Christmas with your family and have the others just you and Rosie where Rosie can cook all she wants?\n\n\\*edit for typo", "Yta", "YTA", "YTA. Rosie\u2019s family traditions are theirs. Why does she feel that she has the right to force your family to do what her family does?", "YTA. If you\u2019re comfortable with Rosie insisting that your Mom host the way Rosie wants her to, why don\u2019t you go into Rosie\u2019s Mom\u2019s kitchen and announce to all the women that they\u2019re going to have to accept your help? I mean, that\u2019s just fair. If it\u2019s fine to disrupt the way your mother hosts, isn\u2019t it fine to disrupt the way Rosie\u2019s family hosts?", "YTA", "Rosie is mad annoying!\n\nShe's not entitled to anything from your mom. She's imposing her family values and traditions on yours...leave your mom alone!", "YTA. Who cares if it's her family tradition it is not yours. Your mom cooks in yours. So what if she doesn't like your fiance she doesn't have to. You said she's never tried breaking you up or even brought it up before. She owes zero explanation for not wanting someone in her kitchen while cooking. She's right though you're pathetic for letting this girl cause an unnecessary ripple.", "That was a bit of a journey.  I began thinking that YTA about making a nuclear decision because Rosie was making assumptions about what it meant not to help in the kitchen based on her family's different traditions.  But it's clear that she was picking up on a vibe that was really there - your mum genuinely doesn't like her and obviously doesn't hide it well enough from her (although she seems to have hidden it from you well enough).  To be fair though, your mother didn't start this, it all emerged through trying to solve the apparent problem of kitchen activity.  That is not the actual problem though.  So.  I still think this is too nuclear an option at this point based on what you've said so I still think YTA.  You can't make someone like your fiance.  You can expect civility and kindness though.  Which it sounds like you had until you blew it all up.   So in an ideal world everyone takes a deep breath and goes back to 'normal'.  Rosie needs to accept that helping in the kitchen isn't a bonding activity in your family and stop trying it.  It would be nice to see if you can engineer some situations where your mother and fiance can get to know each other better and maybe break down some barriers, but not in a weird or forced way.  But ultimately your mum may never really warm to her and both you and Rosie need to be able to live with that, provided your mother is polite, civil and inclusive.  If you go looking for snubs you'll find them - like the kitchen situation, which wasn't actually a snub but just something your family doesn't do.", "YTA. Your Mother likes to cook and didn\u2019t like a lot of folks in the kitchen. Why couldn\u2019t Rosie have brought something to be reheated? Brought dessert? Offered to help with dishes? But. I, YOU forced your Mom into a corner and now you\u2019re pouting and not going to spend anytime with during the holidays.", "YTA why does this need to be the hill Rosie dies on? If she wants to connect with your mom why not figure something else out since your mom has made it very clear this is not the avenue? She's only going to get more annoyed with Rosie the more you two force the relationship on her. If she wants to do it just to make a point than that just makes both of you more of the AHs. Everyone else has accepted your mom doesn't want people in the kitchen - hell, who actually likes having someone else in the kitchen with them anyway - why is this the thing that you guys are putting your foot down for?", "YTA. People stay in the kitchen for different reasons over the holidays. Some people can\u2019t take all the commotion but still want to see their family. My sister does all the cooking because it helps manage her anxiety. If your mom is use to doing all the cooking (and apparently enjoys it), just let her. Part of getting married is getting use to someone else\u2019s family. There are much worse things than not being asked to cook!", "So after years of hammering your mom, she finally said she\u2019s not a fan to get you to drop it, and now you\u2019re insulted. \u201cSnubbed?\u201d Grow up. When you host holidays at your house, you can have all the people you want in your kitchen. Not everyone likes that. My bf\u2019s mom is much like your mom: she\u2019s got her process, she likes her space in her kitchen, and maybe she\u2019ll let us help clean. She says the same thing your mom did, to bring a side. So I do that or a dessert and some wine and stay out of her hair. My family is Italian, so everyone\u2019s in the kitchen, which is fun, but I can see how that\u2019s not everyone\u2019s bag. I may prefer a more lively gathering, but what I don\u2019t do, ever, is take it personally that my bf\u2019s mom does things differently in her own home, where she has every right to. YTA", "Yta every family does things differently and Rosie should accept that. She sounds entitled.", "YTA. \n\nYour mom's not letting ANYONE do much cooking with her, so no, Rosie isn't being snubbed. I also don't really like people in my kitchen, that's a totally valid way to feel and no host is required to let guests cook with them. And given that Rosie keeps trying to force her family's dynamic into yours? I can see how that comes off as annoying.", "YTA. Your mom doesn\u2019t want anyone to help cook, never has, and only admitted to not liking your fianc\u00e9 because you forced her to. You\u2019re 100% in the wrong.", "YTA.

Rosie wasn\u2019t being excluded, she was being treated the same as everyone else in your family which is that your mum cooks for everyone else.

She is allowed to not like her and not want to be stuck in a kitchen with her for hours on end. You and Rosie need to back off and apologise", "YTA we also find rosie annoying", "I'm not seeing how this is a snub on Rosie. If everyone else was asked to help but not Rosie, then that would be a snub. But your mum doesn't want help from anyone much. And her house, her rules. Rosie is pushing her way into the situation  and forcing her traditions on your mother in her own house  then getting all butt hurt when she is not wanted and using it as an excuse to create trouble in your family. You say your mother doesn't like Rosie much. Could it be because Rosie is overbearing and sulky? YTA and Rosie too.", "YTA. Bloody \u2018ell. She can\u2019t just force her way in. Is that what she did with you too? She sounds exhausting", "YTA, Rose doesn\u2019t get to dictate how your family behaves.", "Rosie sounds like a narcissist.  Everything has to be done the way she likes it!! It must revolve around her or she is not going?! Huh?! That's not how life works.", "YTA. My family does potlucks/group cooking but my MIL likes to handle it all herself when she hosts. Different families have different traditions and that\u2019s ok.", "It sounds like your mom has an established role that she wants to keep.  Maybe Rosie should respect moms boundaries and stop being annoying.", "YTA. Rosie is trying to alienate you from your family.

Personally, I don\u2019t like anybody else in my kitchen while I\u2019m cooking, they just get in the way and slow things down.    I also do not want anybody doing the dishes and putting away stuff in my kitchen.      It sounds like your mother feels the same way and there is nothing wrong with that. When you go to a household where everybody is supposed to help, you should be sure to help. When you go to a household where the host or hostess wants to do the work and then present the finished product to the guests, you should let them do that and oooh and ahhhhh  appropriately at what comes out.   \n\nWhy is Rosie trying to shoehorn her way into someone else\u2019s kitchen? That\u2019s actually incredibly rude.", "YTA - First, Never ask someone to be honest with you if you can't handle the answer. Your mom has no one help her. As a mom who prepares the majority of the meals, it's my way of showing how much I love my family and I really love doing it. They help here and there, bring desserts, etc but they know I like to prepare the main parts of the meal. Sounds a lot like your mom. Second, you mom was polite and civil. You and your fianc\u00e9 of four years keep trying to push your agenda on your poor mother on every holiday would be wearisome.  I feel for your mother and you and you alone are the asshole. Don't add Rosie to this. She's just trying to figure out how to fit into a family and following your terrible lead. You owe your mother, nay, the whole fam an apology pie.", "YTA. I despise other people in my kitchen. I know exactly what order I need to do things and when to put things in so that every single thing is ready for the table at the same time. \nIf my husband wants to cook, he cooks the whole meal. If my kids want to cook, I give instruction but do none of the work. \nYour mom didn\u2019t let you know she wasn\u2019t enamoured with Rosie till YOU pushed, and its likely Rosie\u2019s pushing that caused that in the first place.

It's okay to not be the biggest fan, as long as your mom isn't disrespectful or unwelcoming - which it sounds like she isn't.

Not everyone will like her, honestly as a grown woman she should understand this by now. And her continuously pushing your mother didn\u2019t help at all. You and her crossed so many boundaries.\n\nHonestly, your mom probably doesn\u2019t realize yet what a relief it will be to not have people around who ignore and disrespect her and her boundaries. And having someone forced on her. You both need to Grow up and stop the victim mentality.", "Pffff. YTA", "YTA. And so is your GF. Your mom has gifted the family with many years of Christmas joy.

When hosting Rosie can cook to her hearts content and she can also invite your mom and sisters to join her in the kitchen. Maybe they will join her and maybe they won't. It's not entirely impossible to imagine that your mom could become more comfortable with a shared cooking scenario once she has a chance to participate in it in a low stakes environment (she likely won't feel the same pressure to meet her own probably high holiday cooking/tradition standards if not responsible for the meal) . You can also negotiate with your family to host a major holiday whether your mom participates in the kitchen with Rosie or just takes a possibly well needed and enjoyable break from the kitchen.", "YTA.

In her family cooking is a big deal with all of the women in the kitchen (I know and have offered help, don't come for me) and they all take part and socialize while doing it.\n\nIn my family my mom does most of the cooking. My sisters might wander in and out and help, her husband might chop some vegetables, but it is really mainly her. Her MIL stays in the kitchen with her but apparently doesn't know how to cook, or sometimes she has a friend in there. We've offered my mom help and she has politely turned it down.\n\nRosie has been trying to get more involved for the past couple holidays and my mom has snubbed her. Rosie confided in me that she is getting frustrated and feels that she is going to be a member of the family and has the right to be included. I talked to my mom and she suggested Rosie bring a dish and they can reheat and serve it.\n\nAt this point Rosie felt like she was being totally snubbed. I talked to my mom again and she confided in me that she finds Rosie annoying and doesn't want to be forced to spend that much time with her, and it would \"ruin\" her holidays. She said I \"can't\" get mad at her as she has never tried to break us up or even said anything, but I also shouldn't be forcing Rosie on her.\n\nI was furious. I always felt like my mom wasn't crazy about her and borderline cold sometimes, but I couldn't believe she would just admit it like that, and that she is snubbing Rosie during family holidays because of her personal feelings. I told my mom I was disappointed in her for being selfish and immature. I talked to Rosie and we decided we can no longer spend holidays with my family. My mom called me pathetic and said I obviously want a fake relationship if she can't even tell me how she feels. Everyone else in the family texted me pretty much all telling me that I am a huge asshole.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
