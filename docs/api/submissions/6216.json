Basically she's just taking out her frustrations on you but also it seems like this isn't a one time deal either. I agree with the others in the comments.

IMMEDIATELY. \nI have a similar experience: my brother (35) has always got anything he wanted basically, doesn't ever hold down a job for long because he's lazy and entitled (though it's ALWAYS his employers fault \ud83d\ude44), has a college degree that's useless because he just basically got a general studies degree so he could party for 5 years and have it paid for by my parents (mind you, i had to pay for my own school, and for all my expenses, while he got an \"allowance\"), and it just goes on and on. \nSo then you have me. Didn't get shit growing up, had to pay for everything myself, got emancipated at 15 because i had to be homeschooled for most of grade/middle school due to my undiagnosed (at the time) autism, actually graduated at 14 because i was doing 3 days worth of school everyday cause i was bored waiting for my friends to get done with school.\nAnyway, i went thru some SHIT: drugs, incarnation,  etc....but thankfully, i got all that shit outta my system when i was young. Now, I'm married, own my house and vehicles (no loans), run my own business, and in general, have made a decent go of things. \nBut my brother would treat me the same as your sister treats you: he would expect me to do shit for him all the time, and if i tried to refuse, temper tantrums and long txt or emails telling me how unsupportive, selfish, toxic, etc.\nFinally, i was literally on the verge of checking into the hospital (there was a rather big \"incident\" with my brother, and it triggered me so badly i almost had a full blown freak out, which hasn't happened to me in YEARS) when i said to myself, \"enough is enough. All im doing is enabling him and i can't take the bs anymore.\"\nSo i cut him off. \"NO\" to everything... time to fend for yourself bud.\nNot gonna lie, it was messy. We still don't really talk other than holidays. And that kinda sucks. But i have SO much less stress in my life. \nAnd yeah, it's still hard sometimes. I wish things had played out differently. But for the sake of your own mental health, my advice is to nut up and drop the axe. It will hurt, and you will feel guilty at first, and be prepared to be called every name in the book. But in the end, you are only hurting yourself and your sister by subjecting yourself to her narcissism.\nGood luck! \nAnd happy new year", "no, NTA. your sister is an entitled psycho", "NTA.
