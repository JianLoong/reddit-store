She started questioning if my relationship is real because she cannot understand how is it possible that I\u2019m in a relationship while being this fat. I also overheard a conversation she had with my dad, where she was wondering if my boyfriend actually cheats on me, because \u201cit\u2019s not possible that he loves her, she is so fat\u201d.\n\nThis whole week has been dreadful, I regretted deeply spending this week with them and I feel hurt.

My dad agreed with her, told to me that there was no reason for me to talk like this to my mother, because she is correct and she is saying these things out of love.\nI reminded them both that I went through eating disorders growing up that were triggered by my mom\u2019s behavior and constant criticism of my body.

I think you should stop contact for your mental health. They would not like it if you started to pick on their flaws- woah mom, your nose is so ugly. Did you have to blackmail dad to have kids? No really, very very ugly. When you shift the lens and imagine doing a likewise thing to someone else it can give you a better perspective.", "NTA - nope nope nope. As someone who is obese and overweight there is no flipping reason to talk to you like that. You\u2019re doing all the right things it is natural to gain weight especially when doing a dissertation year and it is insane that your mum thinks you gaining a bit of weight means you\u2019re unloveable.

They don\u2019t love you for who you are, just your image and how they think you reflect on them as parents.  Assuming that your boyfriend is cheating because you gained a few pounds is one of the shittiest things I\u2019ve read this week and I don\u2019t doubt your ED issues based on this visit.

Please do whatever you need to do to protect yourself from this hateful behaviour. Please dont feel guilt for protecting yourself.", "NTA \n\nAbsofreakinglutely not. It sounds like your parents are gaslighting you by claiming you never had an ED because they know deep down that they contributed in part to that. You have nothing to feel guilty for! Whatever it is they claim they have done for you and that you ought to be thankful for does not negate the body dysmorphia and self-hatred they are cultivating. No parent should be influencing their child to think their worth and loveableness is inversely proportionate to the number on the weighing scale.", "NTA. Sorry that your mother's insecurities (and dad enabling her) have affected you your whole life. You did great standing up for yourself and you have every right not to invite them to YOUR graduation. If you have to hear her talk crap again, try to remove yourself from what she's saying \"you've gained weight\" and hear the real meaning \"I hate my own body, but I feel better if I drag you down to my level, rather than fix me\" \nI'm petty so I'd play her at her own game \"you've gained weight\", \"why yes I have, thank you for noticing. Looks like you have too\" \"my boyfriend loves bigger girls, so I plan on gaining even more\" \"oh are you not using face cream, I'm sure you've got more wrinkles than last time\" \"wow, your hair got really grey/thin\" \"I'm surprised dad still loves you looking so old\" even thinking these things may help you feel a little better. \nShe has never protected your wellbeing, so don't protect hers.", "NTA. No good and loving parent would ever even think the words 'my child is unlovable' let alone say them aloud, or agree with such views spoken aloud, and then *double down when confronted*. Why would you ever be thankful or grateful to people who think so lowly of you, speak of you so poorly?   \nYou deserve so much better than this.", "NTA. Your mother has serious issues around weight and she's trying to project them on you. The things she said are messed up. For your own wellbeing, I think you were right to say that you don't want to see her.", "The \u201cdid you have to blackmail dad to have kids\u201d lowkey got me laughing while crying!\nThis helped a lot tho! Will probably start to reply like this!", "This got me giggling! I will reply like this next time!", "The worst part of this is that last summer I went back home for three months and they did the same thing. We already had a talk about this, and I\u2019ve already mentioned to them that their words hurt and are only triggering me.

It doesn\u2019t really matter how much I weight, she has been telling me things like that since I was 10.", "I would just make sure that you are on opposite continents when you do.\n\nMay I also assume that your mother may just possibly be of the *zaftig* persuasion herself?  Because she sounds like she's doing more projecting than an IMAX theater.", "A general principle of relationships is you can't change other people, you can only change yourself.\n\nSuppose that they will never change, that they will always say/do this to you. Which, BTW, is unacceptable. \"I hurt you for your own good!\" It's just utter bullshit.\n\nThen you have two choices: (1) status quo (they keep saying ugly things to you) or (2) going LC/NC with them and letting them know why.\n\n(2) would be you changing, accepting that you can't force them to change.", "I am pretty confident that she has body image issues, but she usually denies it!\nShe is probably projecting more than an IMAX theater lmfao!!

I absolutely don't respect you.  You have spent a week belittling me.  Commenting on my body.  That is uncalled for.  Intrusive.  And a horrible thing to do.  So of course I don't respect you.  Dad.  It is not love.  It is bitter.  It is hateful.  And it is hurtful.  There is absolutely no love in it.  It is not criticism.  It is hate.  Pure.  Unadulterated.  Hateful comments.\"   \n    \nI would let both know.  They are not welcome.  That they ruined your vacation.  And you will look for an apology.  Ignore any communication that isn't an apology.

The weight you actually need to lose is the burden of your parents' judgmental ugliness. Go low or no contact with them.", "NTA. Please cut contact with both of them. They don't respect you, and this shit is DAMAGING. You deserve better.", "NTA. Your parents sound like narcissists and please go LC/NC with them ASAP. You can also research the topic of narcissist parents - there are plenty of books written about it and it would open your eyes why your parents are like this and what you should do to help yourself. \n\nSincerely, from someone who also has narcissist parents that bodyshamed them their whole life.", "Yeah or comment something like \"Whoa, Mom, you got SO wrinkled/saggy! Gotta get some Botox/face lift/boob lift/butt lift, etc otherwise Dad might trade you in for a younger model. You can't go around looking like an old bag\"", "Cut her off. Once they're adults parents have to maintain their relationships with their children, you owe them nothing. They can either earn back your trust and respect or they can stay out of your life. If they don't add anything to it, why bother with them?"]}
