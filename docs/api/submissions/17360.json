I've got a bit of a predicament at my job and I'm looking for your take on it.\n\nI'm a 26-year-old female working in a local restaurant alongside \"Lisa\" (23F).

Seeing her so upset, I immediately agreed. I wanted to help her out. I ended up working 12-hour days and by the end of the week, I was pretty worn out but glad I could help.\n\nThen, a few days ago, I stumbled upon some photos on social media. It wasn't a family emergency - Lisa was on a vacation with her boyfriend. They seemed to be having a blast, enjoying the beach and dining at nice restaurants.

She argued that her mental health is as important as any family emergency and she didn't technically lie because her need for a break was an \"emergency\" to her.\n\nI was pretty upset and told her I won't cover her shifts in the future because I couldn't trust her.

I\u2019m pretty sure if Lisa was struggling from mental health issues and needed a break, I feel it would be best if she was honest, rather than lying about a family emergency.", "NTA she lies because she knew you would say no. Then she tried to gaslight you. So never cover her shift, and pay attention to the coworkers who are giving you the cold shoulder. Their shifts should also not be covered by you. They jumped on her train, so she can take their shifts.", "NTA. \n\nLisa sounds like a lot. Let karma take care of her for using a non-existent family emergency. Please hold your ground.", "NTA- she could have just been truthful and been like \u201chey, I\u2019m just fried, I need a break\u201d\u2026 what\u2019s wrong with telling the truth?!", "NTA - Tell the other co-workers the whole story and that Lisa\u2019s a liar, two can play that game", "NTA\n\nLisa lied, you no longer trust her. She can con someone else out of their time off.", "NTA, she could asked, and explain why she was going away for some time and not lied at all.", "NTA- She lied to you, she's probably lying to them about what actually happened. For future purposes I would recommend letting your coworkers know you don't care why they need a shift covered. When is it? If you can/want to do it you will,  if not they can find someone else. Cut all that manipulative bs out of your work life. No reason you couldn't have covered a couple shifts and others covered other shifts. No excuses/reasons from them or for them. Shift A? Nope, sorry. Shift B? Sure. Shift C? Nope, maybe next time. Why not? Because I said no. No is a perfectly valid answer.", "NTA- If you were cast one, go to HR.  In this context, I would tell your co-workers because she might pull the same thing on them.\n\nTell them if anything, it shows you are completely willing to take one for the team in the right context.\n\nBut she lied to you.  You do not owe her anything.", "NTA. She could've just been honest. All she had to say was she's been stressed out and her boyfriend was taking her on vacation. There was no need for her to lie about a family emergency. The fact that she has spun this around on you to make you look like the \"bad guy\" is unfair and just pathetic.", "NTA but you have nothing to gain by picking a fight over this right now.\n\nLet this roll off your back. Don't bother holding a grudge. Simply decide on a case-by-case basis in the future if you're willing to cover a shift.\n\nRight now, she clearly owes you a favor. Whether or not she feels like she should make up for the fact that she lied to you, you covered multiple shifts for her. Don't bother arguing with her until she's repaid that favor to your satisfaction. You've got some leverage. Don't throw it away just yet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
