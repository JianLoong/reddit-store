I ended up working 12-hour days and by the end of the week, I was pretty worn out but glad I could help.\n\nThen, a few days ago, I stumbled upon some photos on social media.

And by lying and refusing to apologize, she was just using you to benefit herself. I wouldnt cover for her anymore either.", "NTA. I\u2019m pretty sure if Lisa was struggling from mental health issues and needed a break, I feel it would be best if she was honest, rather than lying about a family emergency.", "NTA she lies because she knew you would say no. Then she tried to gaslight you. So never cover her shift, and pay attention to the coworkers who are giving you the cold shoulder. Their shifts should also not be covered by you. They jumped on her train, so she can take their shifts.", "NTA. \n\nLisa sounds like a lot. Let karma take care of her for using a non-existent family emergency.

She can con someone else out of their time off.", "NTA, she could asked, and explain why she was going away for some time and not lied at all.", "NTA- She lied to you, she's probably lying to them about what actually happened. For future purposes I would recommend letting your coworkers know you don't care why they need a shift covered. When is it? If you can/want to do it you will,  if not they can find someone else. Cut all that manipulative bs out of your work life. No reason you couldn't have covered a couple shifts and others covered other shifts. No excuses/reasons from them or for them. Shift A? Nope, sorry. Shift B? Sure. Shift C? Nope, maybe next time. Why not? Because I said no. No is a perfectly valid answer.", "NTA- If you were cast one, go to HR.  In this context, I would tell your co-workers because she might pull the same thing on them.\n\nTell them if anything, it shows you are completely willing to take one for the team in the right context.\n\nBut she lied to you.  You do not owe her anything.", "NTA. She could've just been honest. All she had to say was she's been stressed out and her boyfriend was taking her on vacation. There was no need for her to lie about a family emergency. The fact that she has spun this around on you to make you look like the \"bad guy\" is unfair and just pathetic.", "NTA but you have nothing to gain by picking a fight over this right now.\n\nLet this roll off your back. Don't bother holding a grudge. Simply decide on a case-by-case basis in the future if you're willing to cover a shift.\n\nRight now, she clearly owes you a favor. Whether or not she feels like she should make up for the fact that she lied to you, you covered multiple shifts for her. Don't bother arguing with her until she's repaid that favor to your satisfaction. You've got some leverage. Don't throw it away just yet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And all throughout my entire 10 or so years in this industry, there were ppl calling out due to having \"family emergencies\" only to find out later they were just skipping because they wanted too.

Lisa's just upset because she made it sound like someone was *dying* and then I found out I worked myself to death so she could go on holiday! It's like the boy who cried wolf!

You are NOT obligated to cover anyone\u2019s shifts for whatever reason. NTA", "NTA. In my country you get fierd if you call in sick and the boss finds vacation fotos of you online. You can only call in sick if a doctor aproves and have to take vacation days otherwise. There is also something literally called care vacation days (word for word translation) when you need to take care of a sick family member that is registered in the same house as you, doesen't mean the primary registerd adress, since in my country we can be regeistered in many places with one being the main adress and that town is the one we are allowed to vote in. And there is also special vacations for example in case of a sundden death of a family member and mamdetory maternity leave for mothers. But if you are a US citicen you don't have mandetory paed vacation days, you don't even have one mandetory payed vacation day in fact, witch is less then china. The regulation might be diffrent and it might be harder or impossible to get a week of, depending on your employer, but it's still not right to use somebodys compassion to go on vacation and lye to them to get the time off that they need. You are defenetly NTA and it is kind of questionable to me how it is even legal for her to not tell your employer that she wont be coming in for a week and can just ask you directly to take over her shifts. As far as I know in any of the cases you don't come in for even a day of work you have to conatct your boss and it is his obligation to organize replacements for your shift on that day or  that week or anything. The whole system sounds extremly exploitative if you can manipulate somebody to worke two shifts and afterwars run around telling people that person sucks for not doing that again wuthout there being Any legal consequences or the possibillety of being fired for not coming in for a week either without stating a good reason or lying about your reason.", "NTA - do the coworkers giving you the cold shoulder know the truth ?         \nWill they be willing to cover her shifts when she lies to them about the reason ?", "NTA....not petty, just pointing out that she lied in front of the whole (cold shoulder) co-workers. Who knows what BS she spewed out to her co-workers just to make you look bad. That tells ALOT about what kind of person she really is. \nShe's probably done the same thing to other people in the past just so she can look like an angel", "Also op clear the air with your co workers tell them she lied and show them the photos. I doubt she told them the truth. NTA", "Yes sometimes you need a day....A DAY....not a week. That's a big difference. Your NTA", "And if you\u2019re up front about it and tell someone most people who care will be understanding and help out. However when you lie about why you need the time off to trick someone into doing it then they\u2019re gonna feel betrayed and used and not want to help you out again.

You did nothing wrong and I wouldn\u2019t cover for her ever again either.

She should absolutely clue them in that Lisa lied to get her to work.
