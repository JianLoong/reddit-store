And whatever she feels needs doing around the house, I'm sure you can team up on on monday.", "She is 5", "Regardless the family history, teenagers do different things than 5 year olds. If you take a 5 year old to a trip then you end up doing 5 year old stuff, not teenager stuff. While it's good to have activities with the whole family together, it's also important to do things according to the age of the child. It's important that teenagers experience \"adult-like\" activities in a safe environment with a parent, and not only with peers. Like this they can learn how an adult would behave in a certain situation and ask for guidance where they would probably feel embarrassed to ask among friends.\n\nMaybe you can try to explain your wife in this case. Move the narrative away from feelings (\"you love the boys more\") and into \"parenting responsibility\" territory (\"I need to teach the boys this and that before they are adults\"). Try to make her see that it's important for boys on the brink of being men to have positive experiences with grown-up men in order to develop healthy behaviors (especially around girls and women, which she should care about).\n\nTurn this trip into a \"teenager teaching trip\" in front of her (even if your main motives would be different) to show her that a 5 year old would 1. not be in a safe place around there and 2. limit the positive outcomes of the teaching.

If it's a \"Boys' Trip\" then it's something she can never be a part of.  Also, make sure to have an outing with just her soon after that's geared to her interests, even if it's just for the day, to reinforce that she's special, too.\n\nI suspect your wife is worried that you're only interested in bonding with your sons while leaving her to deal with your daughter because \"girl stuff is boring\".

The best thing my hubby and I did when our kids were younger was to have one on one time with each of them. I would take one shopping for new clothes and things and the other got a day with dad.

Also, check in with your wife, it\u2019s also possible that she\u2019s overwhelmed and needs a break.", "NTA\n\nIt's good to have some alone time with the kids both individually and grouped such as your family is structured. Wife sounds jealous and insecure of your boys. As a girl who had a step mom jealous of my relationship with my dad, I can tell you it's a very ugly look.", "NTA only if you take your daughter on a similar excursion. Otherwise, YTA", "NTA. This is ridiculous. You aren\u2019t going to Hawaii for 2 weeks. Enjoy the weekend.", "I do not think you are TA for wanting to take this trip, but I will think you are if you let spending time with your sons create conflict in their home life. \n\nTo that end, you should be talking to your spouse before you finalize plans, in case you've chosen a weekend that makes her life harder, and because she is your partner and that is your job. Not just in this case, but all the time.", "She can distract your daughter for one weekend. This is a great idea. NTA", "NTA...glad you are standing your ground.", "NTA, there's nothing wrong with having a father son trip. There's no reason why your wife can't plan a mother daughter activity while you are gone. Sounds like she's just making excuses. There are times when boys need to spend time alone with their dad and times when girls need to spend time with their mom.", "NTA. maybe if you have time later take you're daughter to lunch as daddy/daughter time? could it be possible that the wife is just wanting a break?", "NTA. but make special time for all three, both you and your wife. Sounds like she's mad she doesn't get a kid free weekend/night.", "NTA, your wife is a jerk for not only insisting that you can't have time with just the boys AND for refusing to do the same with her and your daughter!", "NTA. It\u2019s important for kids to have 1-1 (or in this case 2-1) time with their parents. I feel like in families with a big age gap and with step parents it\u2019s even more important. If your wife needs time to do things by herself on that weekend, she can hire a babysitter", "Shes being the wicked step mother\n\nGiving time to your boys for a few days and hopefully a few weekends out of the year does not mean you do not love your daughter\n\nKeep fighting for your boys my dude\n\nThey need this", "NTA\n\nBut you do have three children and your daughter is feeling understandably left out. \n\nFind out what your daughter is interested in and start planning a daddy daughter day quickly. Make the day all about her and make her feel like a princess.", "NTA. The boys do need your attention and your 9 y/o daughter is old enough to be home with Mom.", "NTA. She needs to understand you need boy time.", "NTA and for the life of me I never can understand why people get married to someone who already has kids without having the mindset that those kids need to be taken care of too.  That it isn't a binary us/them situation.  Your boys need you, and if your wife can't make allowances for that then she shouldn't have married you.", "NTA for wanting \u201cguy\u2019s time\u201d, but please make sure you do something just with your daughter as well. It\u2019s not nice to feel left out, especially when you\u2019re a child.", "NTA. Take the boys on this weekend trip. Make it a blast like never before. Then when you come back, make a day with your daughter. All the things she loves. Or places she loves to go. Explain to your daughter when you get back, what happened and why, and this is your plan to do the same thing for her, and her alone.", "THIS!! NTA", "As the girl of the family who would get left out of boys trips I felt extremely left out. It sucks really bad to be left out of activities and bonding time because of something you can't change.\n\nIf he doesn't explain it like this (very clearly) then he will be TA.", "NTA. Absolutely not. Sometimes I take the boys out on boys trips, and Ill take the girls on girls trips. The grandkids do not have the same interest, and there are a bunch of them, so I separate them for quality time doing stuff they like. They know their turn is coming, and will not let me slide if I don't have something planned for them too. Mom can use the time to bond with daughter, hair and nail day or whatever she is into.", "NTA, but ONLY if you ensure you have equal alone time with your daughter as well", "NTA. You didn't mention the ages of the kids but it's a pretty safe bet that with a 9 year age gap their interests will differ.\n\nYou should make it up to your daughter with some kind of 1:1 activity though.", "NTA - \n\nWhat if she wanted a mommy/daughter day/weekend? Would the boys go too? It makes no sense. \n\nShe needs to open her eyes ((I mean heart)) and make your daughter\u2019s weekend special as well.", "Bad wife. That's all. It's never going to be better. Nta.", "NTA \n\nDid you explain the reasons for this trip to your wife at the outset?\n\nIf she was given plenty of prior notice of this trip with the suggestion that she does something with your daughter,  then I wonder why she doesn't want to take that opportunity.\nShe sounds a bit mean, immature and jealous. \nMaybe she resents you having boys only time.  Or perhaps she would really like a night away with just you.\n\nDoes your wife get any time to herself?  Maybe that's what she wants.\n\nI think your getaway is a lovely idea btw and I really hope you can achieve it without any bad feeling.", "NTA. Just offer to do a daddy/daughter thing too at some point. And maybe just you and all 3 kids another time. That way she knows it's that you cherish those more specific and intentional bonding moments and not that you're trying to teach your kids that guys get to do some things and girls can't.", "Unlike most, I'm leaving the wife out of the equation since it's really not about her at all. Unless you also make \"1 on 1\" with your daughter as well YTA.", "NTA. The boys lost their mother to death. And youre doing what you can to avoid them losing you to absence and inattention.", "Nta\nYou are allowed to bond with your boys without your daughter.", "Don't forget that OP is doing this because he hasn't been spending anything like equal time on his sons; his daughter has been getting more of his time and attention, for years now. Doing this in the first place is an effort to make up for giving his sons short shrift, so he literally doesn't have anything to make up to his daughter.", "Take your daughter out first, then it's the boys turn. Easier to justify.", "Op commented that the daughter is 5", "Don't forget that OP is doing this because he hasn't been spending anything like equal time on his sons; his daughter has been getting more of his time and attention, for years now.", "Perhaps suggest that this would be a good time for mom and daughter to do something together.  Suggest they both get manicures or haircuts.  Then lunch followed with a girlie movie.   Some shopping.  Unless your wife is not interested in that kind of thing.  Five isn\u2019t too young for these things.", "Yeah definitely phrase this as a big kid trip and promise her a special day later. And keep that promise.", "NTA.  My dad took my older brothers hunting every year.  The younger kids had to stay home. Mom made it the best time.  We each got to pick out a new toy, get take out for dinner and just play.  It was a magical time.  We never felt left out because Mom and Dad made sure all of us felt special.", "NTA.  Spend the weekend with your sons.  Can't believe your wife is doing this.", "NTA. \nI think individual activities with individual parents is healthy. That way each child gets undivided attention. Children are just small people, not a group to b meshed together. Each need time & space \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "NTA This is vital that you do this with the boys. If your wife is that insecure and jealous then ask her to get therapy. Your daughter will understand if no one makes a big deal out of it . You can tell her that she gets the next one on one trip. Leave your wife at home for that one too. Find some place for the boys to go so she isn't alone with them while you and daughter are gone.", "NTA but maybe consider if your wife deserves a break?", "I think OP needs to run it by his wife to make sure she is free that weekend, and get her approval.  Especially if OP is usually the caregiver for daughter on weekends.", "Kids need alone time bonding with their parents, regardless of gender."]}
