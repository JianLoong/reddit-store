Tell your wife you will do something nice with your daughter, but it\u2019s healthy for just the guys to get away for some time. There will come a time where she and her daughter will also want to get away together without the boys. If she can\u2019t understand that, then it sounds like she\u2019s TA.", "INFO how old is your daughter? \n\nRegardless, NTA it is on both of you as parents to manage your daughters upset if she doesn\u2019t get something she wants, you shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice your time with your sons just to appease her. What you should do is plan a day to spend with just her as well, because I\u2019m sure she\u2019d appreciate that a lot and it would hopefully stop any thoughts of favouritism. You definitely need to make sure your wife is on the same page though because you don\u2019t want her feeding those thoughts to your daughter. If your wife\u2019s issue is really about wanting a break from childcare for a weekend then organise for your daughter to stay with grandparents or other family, or at a friends house so your wife can get that break.", "NTA \n\nTell your daughter that both of you will have a daddy-daughter day so she'll be able to have your attention. \n\nMy mom used to have a \"girl's day\" with my twin sister and I when we were little up until my sister moved away then I did earlier this year. Those were some of my best memories.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnless you are taking your daughter on solo outings, too.", "Agree with this. It's only fair that his daughter gets to have equal time with her dad as much as her brothers.", "Yeah, worth checking. And whatever she feels needs doing around the house, I'm sure you can team up on on monday.", "She is 5", "Regardless the family history, teenagers do different things than 5 year olds. If you take a 5 year old to a trip then you end up doing 5 year old stuff, not teenager stuff. While it's good to have activities with the whole family together, it's also important to do things according to the age of the child. It's important that teenagers experience \"adult-like\" activities in a safe environment with a parent, and not only with peers. Like this they can learn how an adult would behave in a certain situation and ask for guidance where they would probably feel embarrassed to ask among friends.\n\nMaybe you can try to explain your wife in this case. Move the narrative away from feelings (\"you love the boys more\") and into \"parenting responsibility\" territory (\"I need to teach the boys this and that before they are adults\"). Try to make her see that it's important for boys on the brink of being men to have positive experiences with grown-up men in order to develop healthy behaviors (especially around girls and women, which she should care about).\n\nTurn this trip into a \"teenager teaching trip\" in front of her (even if your main motives would be different) to show her that a 5 year old would 1. not be in a safe place around there and 2. limit the positive outcomes of the teaching. Point out to her that, as you usually never do things just with the teenagers, you have to make the most out of this one trip, in order to make this \"teaching\" worthwile.", "NTA. Your boys lost their mother. Your wife should understand that you need to spend one on one time with them.", "NTA.\n\nMake sure the trip is explained as an \"Older Kid\" trip rather than a \"Boys' Trip.\"  This way your daughter sees it as something she'll get to do with you when she gets older.  If it's a \"Boys' Trip\" then it's something she can never be a part of.  Also, make sure to have an outing with just her soon after that's geared to her interests, even if it's just for the day, to reinforce that she's special, too.\n\nI suspect your wife is worried that you're only interested in bonding with your sons while leaving her to deal with your daughter because \"girl stuff is boring\".  Also, why is your wife so busy on the weekends?  Is the division of labor equally distributed?", "NTA for wanting this trip alone with your boys, but Y T A for saying SHE should do something with your daughter. YOU should plan a special weekend with your daughter too. Your daughter needs special time with her dad too", "Have YOU taken the time to explain to your daughter why you are doing this? If you haven't then YOU are just as much TA as your wife. As much as you want to do things for your sons if you haven't taken time to explain it to your daughter then it WILL come off as you love them more. It's not your wife's job to do it. She's not the one taking off and leaving the daughter behind. Man up dad. \n\nNTA but and this is a big but, you will be if YOU DO NOT EXPLAIN things to your daughter.", "NTA and you offered your wife an excellent compromise. The best thing my hubby and I did when our kids were younger was to have one on one time with each of them. I would take one shopping for new clothes and things and the other got a day with dad. It helps to have just one to focus on and builds a stronger relationship. \n\nYou sound like a good dad so just keep doing what you\u2019re doing. Your wife sounds like she just wants a weekend off without kids. She needs to be more understanding of your boys needs.", "Tough situation but definitely NTA.  Not certain if Mom wants a free weekend or really is concerned about the little one. You are doing right by the boys and I applaud that.", "NTA. Your wife is being ridiculous. Take your boys for a boys weekend and make plans later to take your daughter some where for a dad and daughter weekend. Involve your daughter in making the daddy daughter weekend plans and keep reminding her that just like her brothers who got a weekend with dad, she will be too. Kids are more understand then adults give them credit for.", "ESH, only because you should have discussed this with your wife first. Have a great weekend with your boys!", "NTA but your wife sure is. \n\nThis should be a wake up call to you. Your wife resents the time you spend parenting your sons.

He had 4 kids all with my mom he is still married to. So... yeah. Spending one on one/special time with your kids is great and already should have been implemented", "NTA. This is a long overdue weekend. The boys deserve the private undivided attention. They have sacrificed a lot over time without complaint. Stick to your guy only boundary on this. Your wife needs to stop being so selfish and actually step up and take care of your daughter. It really seems like she's trying to shirk her responsibility as a parent in this and is passively trying to find a way to get a weekend to herself.", "NTA\u2026your wife us just upset that she is not getting a \u201cfree\u201d weekend.  She is making all about your daughter when in reality it is not.  She is the one making your daughter feel less, not you.", "NTA- stand your ground your sons need you just as much as your daughter does. Your wife is just being difficult on purpose dont feed into her BS. In front of your daughter bring up that they should have a Mom & daughter Spa weekend, see what she says but regardless your sons also deserve your undivided attention.", "NTA but only because she\u2019s a baby. Please include her whenever she\u2019s older. You have no idea how girls look up to their dads and being excluded from trips like this (when she\u2019s older) really mark you. \nIf you want sons time then make sure to also have daughter-dad time.", "NTA I have a son and daughter. Me and my partner take turns taking each of the out on little dates. Maybe think of a date that you can take just your daughter on?\n\nIt's important that the kids get one on one time with their parents.", "NTA", "As background, I\u2019m one of 8 kids.\n\nSometimes, my parents took my older siblings to stuff and left me and the younger kids at home.\n\nSometimes my parents took me out and left everyone else at home.\n\nSometime my parent took one sibling out and left me and the others at home.\n\nSometimes I went out with just Dad, or just Mom. Dad always took me Christmas shopping and out to dinner by myself. Mom always took me out of school in the afternoon of my birthday and we went out to lunch and then did something fun.\n\nFrankly finding activities that kids who are 9 years apart will all enjoy is tough. Sometimes finding activities that both boys and girls will like is tough. \n\nThere is no need for everyone to do everything together all the time. OP can take his daughter out later.

Our kids are all super close in age and all have the same biological parents and we still set aside time to do this.\n\nYour wife is manipulating you either because she likes the arrangement where you put your shared child above your twins and or she doesn\u2019t wanna be bothered to care for the child over the weekend.", "On this issue NTA. In general, yes, because your boys didn\u2019t need you less than your daughter. They have you only. She has 2 parents.", "NTA\n\nBut your wife is.", "NTA \n\nYour sons need time alone with you from time to time.

Not that he wasn't going to do something with his daughter.", "NTA. I'm a mom of 3 and a firm believer in 1 on 1 time. My husband and I both pick something with our kids and set up a date once a month doing what they want to do. Sometimes we do things just 3 of us (mom/dad/kid 1 then next time is kid 2 then kid 3). It's important to let them know that you understand they're individuals with different interests and needs.", "INFO: did you discuss the timing and plans with your wife *before* organizing the trip, or only after things were booked. You\u2019re not an AH for doing this for your sons, it sounds like a good idea, but if it was \u201cHey honey, I\u2019m taking the boys to a cabin next weekend, have a fun girls weekend\u201d then that\u2019s a dick move.", "NTA", "It\u2019s a guys trip. \n\nYou take the girl out another time.

Maybe they thought your daughter needed you more, but they were wrong. Your kids need you equally, and they had lost their mother.

Make a plan for a special weekend for her too, whether it\u2019s a trip away or special dad-daughter things locally. \n\nEvery kid needs to feel cherished in their personal relationship with their parents, and just because you\u2019re doing maintenance on your boys\u2019 relationship doesn\u2019t preclude your daughter from also having that special time. Your wife needs to get that through her head.", "NTA- I am struggling to think of an activity suitable for kids 9 years apart in age that they can all enjoy at the same pace unless the baby sister is about 17 and the lads are 26. How old is kidetta and is she a big hiker/camper/fisher/whatever you're going to do-er? Cos this sounds like a dead easy 'you can come when you're big enough' for diplomacy in the sane world. What you have here is a wife who got the sniff of a weekend off then decided your daughter reeeeeeeeeeally wants to go. If she is any age you can still call a baby, I'm guessing she likes Hey Dougie and chunky building blocks more...", "Did you even talk to your wife before booking the trip, or just assume her plans? \n\nAre you going to do something similar with just your daughter? \n\nYes, the boys need alone time with dad, but so does your daughter. \n\nIf wife refuses to watch daughter, can she have a sleepover with friend house or with aunt/grandparents?", "NTA. All kids need one on one time with their parents and it sounds like your sons are overdue.

Gross.", "Everyone is the asshole but less op this time.  Yta but smaller than wife", "INFO: Do you do special 1 on 1 time with your daughter?\n\nETA: Your wife said she can't do something with your daughter because she is busy around the house on the weekends.

I have a bonus son, a toddler daughter and am in my 3rd trimester. My husband regularly does things with my bonus and leaves the little at home.

He should be ensuring all his children spend an equal amount of time with him even outside of this trip.", "It was a hypothetical?", "Just seems weird to just assume ops wife wouldn\u2019t object to it.

But if it were the other way around, and it was a father/daughter trip, the wife more than likely wouldn\u2019t try and force the sons on the trip.\n\nIt makes perfect sense, cos the wife is being intentionally \u201cdumb\u201d about the concept of a guys trip by insisting on the daughter going too.", "Ok and I\u2019m asking why are you saying that ? Why wouldn\u2019t the wife also want the boys to come ? Considering the only singular example you are basing this on show shows the opposite", "Because it\u2019s a FATHER AND SON trip. Why should the DAUGHTER come on a FATHER AND SON trip? And vice versa?

I don\u2019t have time for you. Go bother someone else.
