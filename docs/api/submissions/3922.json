Probably not. \n\nYour boys have been through a lot and they have been very understanding of the fact that you've had to devote a lot of attention to raising their younger sister - and it's hard for children to have that much emotional intelligence when they only have one living parent left. \n\nYour sons (literal children) seem more empathetic towards the family as a unit than your wife does for literal children. Your son's deserve some quality father-son time.", "NTA all the way. Does your wife just want a weekend off kids, or is she really not seeing your point? Either way, stick to your idea, your boys will undoubtedly love it and it will be a new amazing memory for you. And you can do something separately with you daughter too afterwards as well!", "NTA. Go have a nice father-sons time, I'm sure they'll love the idea! Even without the reasoning you have, a baby is too little to be taken to a \"getaway in a cabin in the mountains\" anyway. However, it might be a good idea to suggest your wife to go somewhere either alone or with your sons too while you stay at home with your daughter. Maybe she would like a break from her.", "NTA if YOU explain it to your daughter and make sure she knows she will have equal daddy-daughter time in the  near future with activities she gets to pick.  But your wife needs to understand that your sons also need a dad and need some one-on-one time.\n\nGood luck, sounds like your wife is going to make this difficult.", "NTA \nIt's good to have some time sperately with your different children. It allows them to take up all of your attention for a little while and allows you to bond with them one-on-one, or in this case, one-on-two.\nI always appreciated the time my mum or dad spent with me on my own. I felt like they were taking the time to connect with me as a person. It felt easier to talk because I didn't have to compete with my younger siblings' noise.\nI hope your wife will see the value in this.", "Nta \n\nKids need alone time bonding with their same sex parent. As long as you are also giving your daughter her turns at alone time with you as well, its totally fine for this to be a guys only trip.", "Nta as long as you do something special with her separately", "NTA. To this day, the best memory I have is when my dad and I took a whole daybon vacation for just the two of us and went on a mountain hike to a crashed plane. No mom, no younger sister. Sometimes kids need that kind of 1 on 1 (or 2 on 1 in this case) moments with one of their parents.", "NTA. \n\nMaybe check in with the wife and see if she actually needs a weekend away to herself but doesn't know how to ask?\n\nOr she's insecure about your first wife.

What you should do is plan a day to spend with just her as well, because I\u2019m sure she\u2019d appreciate that a lot and it would hopefully stop any thoughts of favouritism. You definitely need to make sure your wife is on the same page though because you don\u2019t want her feeding those thoughts to your daughter.

It's only fair that his daughter gets to have equal time with her dad as much as her brothers.", "Yeah, worth checking. And whatever she feels needs doing around the house, I'm sure you can team up on on monday.", "She is 5", "Regardless the family history, teenagers do different things than 5 year olds. If you take a 5 year old to a trip then you end up doing 5 year old stuff, not teenager stuff. While it's good to have activities with the whole family together, it's also important to do things according to the age of the child. It's important that teenagers experience \"adult-like\" activities in a safe environment with a parent, and not only with peers. Like this they can learn how an adult would behave in a certain situation and ask for guidance where they would probably feel embarrassed to ask among friends.\n\nMaybe you can try to explain your wife in this case. Move the narrative away from feelings (\"you love the boys more\") and into \"parenting responsibility\" territory (\"I need to teach the boys this and that before they are adults\"). Try to make her see that it's important for boys on the brink of being men to have positive experiences with grown-up men in order to develop healthy behaviors (especially around girls and women, which she should care about).\n\nTurn this trip into a \"teenager teaching trip\" in front of her (even if your main motives would be different) to show her that a 5 year old would 1. not be in a safe place around there and 2. limit the positive outcomes of the teaching. Point out to her that, as you usually never do things just with the teenagers, you have to make the most out of this one trip, in order to make this \"teaching\" worthwile."]}
