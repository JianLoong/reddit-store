They fooled around and won the big prize. She is 5 months pregnant. When I found out I told them I'd be supportive in anything but marriage as they are too young. I offered her a room in the house so she could still go to college while I watched the baby. \n\nGF is homeschooled and her parents are pastors. Since she couldn't marry him, she decided to give baby up for adoption so it could be raised in a Christian two parent home. When my son told her he would raise baby alone  (with my family help) if she was determined to give it up, she threatened to have abortion if he didn't sign adoption papers. \n\nShe told him she didn't want her child being raised by a single mom (me) in our heathen household. Our house was too small, messy, we curse occasionally, watch movies, do not attend church regularly etc... Basically not a good enough for the baby but good enough for her to hang out in every waking moment with my son. She wanted to be with my son at all costs but the baby would get in the way. \n\nThey broke up but her parents continued to pressure my son into giving up custody. So my son enlists in marines to show  he can provide for child and  offer a future. They tell him being absent for first years of baby life would make  him a horrible dad.\n\nAfter several scary mental health episodes on ex-gf part ( running away from home, threats) she tells my son she took abortion pill. So my son is super upset but I tell him there is nothing he can do. Her body her choice.Then the next day he tell me, she regretted it and  they found a Dr to reverse pills effects.. \n\nNow I'm seeing every kind of red flag here but my son insists that she is just scared and not the manipulative person I think she is. They get back together. She convinced him to try and  break enlistment so he can stay with her and be a family. I understand that they are both super young, brains not fully developed etc... but their relationship is toxic. \n\nI can see the writing on the wall but ultimately it's his choice since they are 18.  But in the end, my home is my safe space and she hands out chaos and drama like they are party favors. AITA for not allowing her in my home for my own mental health?\n\n*Edit* my son has gone to all her appts so she is really  pregnant.", "created_utc": 1682517576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zignd/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sons_pregnant_gf_in_house/", "score": 275, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do find it hypocritical that she doesn\u2019t want the baby to to raised in a heathen household but she was committing a sin herself when she had premarital sex. \n\nIs the pregnancy confirmed through a doctor or at-home test? I\u2019m wondering if she feels bad about having sex and is trying to make up for it by trying to convince your son to marry her.\n\nEdit: The ex is really pregnant. \n\nDepending on where you are, your son has more rights than others. In my state, both parents need to sign off on the adoption but there are states where she can put the child up without is consent. Your son may need a lawyer to sort all that stuff out, but everyone needs to stop taking her calls. Save texts, emails, voicemails, and call logs to present to the lawyer and judge if and when you fight for custody.", "You do know she\u2019s probably lying about an abortion pill.

Abortion pills usually only work in the first trimester (as far as I know) and I don't think there is some kind of reverse pill (but I'm not a doctor and if she has only taken the first one, maybe).\n\nWhy does she wants to live with you now? Was she kicked out by her family? If not, don't offer her to stay.\n\nBut if you do, maybe think about the option together with your son, to keep her well till the baby comes and then your son can fill out for full custody.\n\nINFO: as others already asked, are you sure, she is really pregnant?

I hope you can talk some sense into your son but he's young and it looks like he's well on his way to fucking up his life.

If you've seen ultrasounds/have certifiable proof that she's pregnant, then I'd say she had planned to have an abortion or give the baby up from the go, she just needed your son to get her out of her parents' home, but she never intended to raise the child. Hence when her plan started to fail, she went rogue with all the lies about your lifestyle and the ridiculous nonsense about the pills. \n\nBut honestly, since she's only 5 months along, I wouldn't put it past her to have completely fabricated the pregnancy and just be looking for a way to end the lie without losing your son. \n\nTry to help him see the light. He's only 18 and such an unhealthy relationship could have life-long consequences for him, regardless of whether he becomes a father or not.", "NTA, and yeah a) confirm that she is actually pregnant, b) the pill story is BS, there is no way to reverse it, and anyway there is no way it would work at 5 months without putting her in grave danger, c) her parents might actually be the ones causing her so much whiplash. Don't sign anything, don't admit to anything, if your son wants to enlist, let him go forward with the enlistment. Once the baby is out, either there will be a custody battle, or the girl does decide to surrender the baby for adoption, and your son gets all the custody by default as a father. For now,  keep calm and wait it out.", "Go to her house and speak to her parents about this. Tell them all the things she does. Put them all in a group chat so that her parents are on the same page. I think parents from both sides should discuss and agree on the arrangements regarding both your son and their daughter. Bring your son and an adult family member during the meeting. \n\nLet them know your thoughts about the adoption matter and let them know that she took pills that could endanger the pregnancy and herself. Let her parents know all the stunts shes been pulling and ask them to keep an eye on her for her own safety because you cannot be held responsible if anything happens to her. \n\nThe way she cannot marry your son, and makes decisions within her rights, you have the right to not want her in your house. Just let her parents know that she cannot come uninvited and if she does, she cannot misbehave.", "So a doctor prescribed abortion pills...at 5mo pregnant...she allegedly takes them and then found a doctor the very next day to magically reverse the effects? It doesn't work like that. None of this works like that.\n\nLady, this girl has some serious MH issues and is 100% lying about this baby.", "NTA but also realize there's a very high likelihood that this eventually ruins your relationship with your son (and eventual grandchild). Seems like he's in deep and is about to make some very poor, life-altering decisions. I think you need to figure out what kind of relationship you want to have with him moving forward.", "NTA, but this is super messy...\n\nDefinitely see toxicity in a person who is supposedly a 'good christian girl' who feels the baby is better off aborted than in a single parent home... Not to mention, the home is good enough for her to be in often enough? That sounds more like a control thing than anything. \n\nMost likely, adoption would be best for this kid, though I'm sure your son would be very upset. Ultimately, girlfriend is too inconsistent and a bouquet of red flags, even if your son is doing his best to care for a kid.

From the comments, it sounds like her parents aren't just standard Christian but they are anti-science and anti anything the slightest bit not biblical fundamentalist Christian, which probably means she's getting a lot of pressure from them to adopt out, etc.  They may not have told anyone she's pregnant and she's being told to stop looking pregnant, etc.  They may have threatened to kick her out, or any other number of horrible things.  She may have been parroting her parents' words in her reasoning for putting it up for adoption because that would get them off her back.  I can't explain that whole abortion pill thing.  I mean, she obviously lied about it, but I'm not sure what she was tryin to accomplish.
