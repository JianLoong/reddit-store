They fooled around and won the big prize. She is 5 months pregnant. When I found out I told them I'd be supportive in anything but marriage as they are too young. I offered her a room in the house so she could still go to college while I watched the baby. \n\nGF is homeschooled and her parents are pastors. Since she couldn't marry him, she decided to give baby up for adoption so it could be raised in a Christian two parent home. When my son told her he would raise baby alone  (with my family help) if she was determined to give it up, she threatened to have abortion if he didn't sign adoption papers. \n\nShe told him she didn't want her child being raised by a single mom (me) in our heathen household. Our house was too small, messy, we curse occasionally, watch movies, do not attend church regularly etc... Basically not a good enough for the baby but good enough for her to hang out in every waking moment with my son. She wanted to be with my son at all costs but the baby would get in the way. \n\nThey broke up but her parents continued to pressure my son into giving up custody. So my son enlists in marines to show  he can provide for child and  offer a future. They tell him being absent for first years of baby life would make  him a horrible dad.\n\nAfter several scary mental health episodes on ex-gf part ( running away from home, threats) she tells my son she took abortion pill. So my son is super upset but I tell him there is nothing he can do. Her body her choice.Then the next day he tell me, she regretted it and  they found a Dr to reverse pills effects.. \n\nNow I'm seeing every kind of red flag here but my son insists that she is just scared and not the manipulative person I think she is. They get back together. She convinced him to try and  break enlistment so he can stay with her and be a family. I understand that they are both super young, brains not fully developed etc... but their relationship is toxic. \n\nI can see the writing on the wall but ultimately it's his choice since they are 18.  But in the end, my home is my safe space and she hands out chaos and drama like they are party favors. AITA for not allowing her in my home for my own mental health?\n\n*Edit* my son has gone to all her appts so she is really  pregnant.", "created_utc": 1682517576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zignd/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sons_pregnant_gf_in_house/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you can't reverse an abortion pill. Best case scenario she lied about that whole deal. Worst- she didn't and did serious damage to the fetus.", "NTA. She's picking and choosing which parts of religion/Christianity are important to her.", "NTA the relationship is quite toxic and inviting her into the home would make life hell for everyone involved. I do find it hypocritical that she doesn\u2019t want the baby to to raised in a heathen household but she was committing a sin herself when she had premarital sex. \n\nIs the pregnancy confirmed through a doctor or at-home test? I\u2019m wondering if she feels bad about having sex and is trying to make up for it by trying to convince your son to marry her.\n\nEdit: The ex is really pregnant. \n\nDepending on where you are, your son has more rights than others. In my state, both parents need to sign off on the adoption but there are states where she can put the child up without is consent. Your son may need a lawyer to sort all that stuff out, but everyone needs to stop taking her calls. Save texts, emails, voicemails, and call logs to present to the lawyer and judge if and when you fight for custody.", "You do know she\u2019s probably lying about an abortion pill.   I don\u2019t think a pill at that time is even a real thing and the doctor reverse is a lie to. That girl is crazy but also a normal scared teen. \n\nNTA but son had a part in this too. It\u2019s his problem not yours.", "I have a feeling that the girlfriend isn\u2019t even pregnant.  Nta.  There are too many red flags with this girl.", "INFO: Are you sure she's even pregnant? \n\nShe's claiming she tried to have an abortion at 5mos. I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that can only be done when the pregnancy compromises the mother's health.", "NTA. This girl seems to lie. Abortion pills usually only work in the first trimester (as far as I know) and I don't think there is some kind of reverse pill (but I'm not a doctor and if she has only taken the first one, maybe).\n\nWhy does she wants to live with you now? Was she kicked out by her family? If not, don't offer her to stay.\n\nBut if you do, maybe think about the option together with your son, to keep her well till the baby comes and then your son can fill out for full custody.\n\nINFO: as others already asked, are you sure, she is really pregnant? Sounds a little bit, like she is building lie after lie to get married to your son and pitty", "Your son needs a lawyer...", "This is above reddit\u2019s paygrade. You and your son need a lawyer.", "NTA - Document everything. Create a timeline, save any evidence of threats etc. Don't let her move in. Support your son as best you can given the circumstances. Once the baby arrives your son needs to 1. establish paternity, 2. File for custody if that is his choice. \n\nHer story switches, manipulative tactics etc. make it seem like there is a lot more at play here than \"Christian family Values\". I would not be surprised to learn the reason she is pushing so hard for adoption is that the baby is already \"adopted\" to a family in her church for some $$$.", "Holy mother of drama.", "NTA but what a mess. I hope you can talk some sense into your son but he's young and it looks like he's well on his way to fucking up his life. Offer to take him to consult a lawyer so he can be realistic about the possible outcomes.  The crazy girl is not going to last as a gf or a mother, I'm guessing.", "Info. Have you seen ultrasound photos? Have you seen a bump? Are you 100% sure this girl is pregnant? Some of this reads she wants to get married as soon as she can and is looking for ways to make that happen.", "NTA and don't ever give in (don't let her move into your house), but sadly this girl sounds like she has more than one psychological issue and your son is absorbed into the toxicity of their relationship. \n\nMy guess, she wants to get out of her conservative family's house and thought marrying your son was the way to do that. If you've seen ultrasounds/have certifiable proof that she's pregnant, then I'd say she had planned to have an abortion or give the baby up from the go, she just needed your son to get her out of her parents' home, but she never intended to raise the child. Hence when her plan started to fail, she went rogue with all the lies about your lifestyle and the ridiculous nonsense about the pills. \n\nBut honestly, since she's only 5 months along, I wouldn't put it past her to have completely fabricated the pregnancy and just be looking for a way to end the lie without losing your son. \n\nTry to help him see the light. He's only 18 and such an unhealthy relationship could have life-long consequences for him, regardless of whether he becomes a father or not.", "NTA, and yeah a) confirm that she is actually pregnant, b) the pill story is BS, there is no way to reverse it, and anyway there is no way it would work at 5 months without putting her in grave danger, c) her parents might actually be the ones causing her so much whiplash. Don't sign anything, don't admit to anything, if your son wants to enlist, let him go forward with the enlistment. Once the baby is out, either there will be a custody battle, or the girl does decide to surrender the baby for adoption, and your son gets all the custody by default as a father. For now,  keep calm and wait it out.", "Go to her house and speak to her parents about this. Tell them all the things she does. Put them all in a group chat so that her parents are on the same page. I think parents from both sides should discuss and agree on the arrangements regarding both your son and their daughter. Bring your son and an adult family member during the meeting. \n\nLet them know your thoughts about the adoption matter and let them know that she took pills that could endanger the pregnancy and herself. Let her parents know all the stunts shes been pulling and ask them to keep an eye on her for her own safety because you cannot be held responsible if anything happens to her. \n\nThe way she cannot marry your son, and makes decisions within her rights, you have the right to not want her in your house. Just let her parents know that she cannot come uninvited and if she does, she cannot misbehave.", "So a doctor prescribed abortion pills...at 5mo pregnant...she allegedly takes them and then found a doctor the very next day to magically reverse the effects? It doesn't work like that. None of this works like that.\n\nLady, this girl has some serious MH issues and is 100% lying about this baby.", "NTA but also realize there's a very high likelihood that this eventually ruins your relationship with your son (and eventual grandchild). Seems like he's in deep and is about to make some very poor, life-altering decisions. I think you need to figure out what kind of relationship you want to have with him moving forward.", "NTA, but this is super messy...\n\nDefinitely see toxicity in a person who is supposedly a 'good christian girl' who feels the baby is better off aborted than in a single parent home... Not to mention, the home is good enough for her to be in often enough? That sounds more like a control thing than anything. \n\nMost likely, adoption would be best for this kid, though I'm sure your son would be very upset. Ultimately, girlfriend is too inconsistent and a bouquet of red flags, even if your son is doing his best to care for a kid. Perhaps there's a way to set up the adoption arrangement so the child has free access to his information?", "NTA\n\nI have some sympathy for this girl because she's been indoctrinated by her parents, and the fact that she's being pressured by her family to adopt the baby out to someone in their religion is absolutely disgusting (lowkey infant trafficking vibes, which can unfortunately be common among conservative Christian communities).\n\nIf you and your son would really be willing to take the baby on without his gf's involvement, y'all should lawyer up asap to make sure you get as much custody as possible with a newborn (which probably isn't much, but I know nothing) and try to keep evidence of all of her erratic behavior, threats, etc.\n\n(Also there's no way she got an abortion pill at 5 months pregnant. Definitely seems like a lie to me.)", "NTA. If this causes too much of a strain on the relationship with your son, you could set some ground rules before allowing her back into your home.", "She wants to give the kid up for adoption?\n\nShe\u2019s offering your son an out to having ruined his life and you don\u2019t want him to take it?\n\nESH", "Why are you against adoption ? This child could have a good home, family with 2 parents, be loved, by adults who are ready to have a child\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with single parents but your son is going to go join the military?? And be gone for years? Then you will raise the baby alone? Do you actually want to sign up to be a parent again? bc your son will likely be no help at all, he has no idea what he\u2019s doing or what he\u2019s getting himself into", "NTA Your house is not a good christian home.

If she's not already seeing someone for her mental health, I think this may help her.", "Depends on the state.

And there are no guarantees of a happy life  with adoption especially if it's in the same church she belongs to. They don't believe in dinosaurs, enough said.", "Depends.

After 24 weeks, that it\u2019s only if there is significant medical concern for mother or the fetus is no longer viable. I can\u2019t find a healthy mother and fetus being able to legally get an abortion in the US after 24 works.", "Thank you for clarification :)", "As a doctor i Can confirm you cant reverse the abortion pill. At 5 months, it kills the fetus first and then the patient takes a second medicine that causes labor. And the delivery of a dead fetus. Otherwise imagine the horror of having to let it die or kill it outside?\nBest case she lied. Worst case the baby is dead.", "That will change again.\n\nYour son may not understand all the consequences, so I would encourage him to meet with the lawyer at least once, even if he doesn\u2019t want to.", "I watch waaay too many crime dramas as well so take that with a grain of salt. Honestly though, this is a really tough situation for your family and I truly hope it works out to the best.", "Check and see if your state/country has ways of establishing paternity before birth so that the baby can\u2019t be adopted without your son\u2019s consent. You\u2019ll be in for a bigger fight contesting the adoption if you can\u2019t prove your son\u2019s involvement and consistent desire to keep the baby.

At least now they know that their daughter acts up. Suggests to them that she probably needs counselling. \n\nHow about sitting with your son? I think he must be stressed out over this issue. Offer support and suggestions on how to \"clean\" this mess. Giving the child up for adoption as other redditors mentioned may not be a bad idea for his future. Him being tied up with this girl may not be a good thing for him. Tell him she should remain at her house so that her family can keep an eye for her. He should schedule meet ups with her at her house (you can offer to come with him) regularly while her parents are home.
