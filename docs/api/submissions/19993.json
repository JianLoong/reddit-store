I\u2019m getting married in 2 weeks. I(28F) had told my friend that she(29F) was allowed a plus one when I sent her the invite months ago. She was dating someone at the time and I figured she would bring him. I just found out that she broke up/ took a break (not sure on the details still confused). She is now seeing a mutual friend of ours, she wants to bring him to the wedding. The thing is I\u2019ve hooked up with the guy in the past. I don\u2019t have feeling for the guy it was a dumb young thing. My fianc\u00e9(M27) knows about the guy, he doesn\u2019t really care for him. I told him that it was his decision to make. That what ever he wanted to do I would stand by it. I told him that I don\u2019t want to make him uncomfortable by having that guy there. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 said he doesn\u2019t care if he\u2019s there. That he will not go out of his way to talk to him. Or spend any time with him. I told him are you sure? I feel like it\u2019s weird and disrespectful toward my fianc\u00e9.  My fianc\u00e9 said if that\u2019s who she wants to bring and is dating she can bring him cause we already told her she could bring someone. We\u2019ve all have told her in the past that she should date this guys. That he would be great for her. So we can\u2019t deny her having him there. So would I be the ass hole for telling her he can\u2019t come? It\u2019s just fucken weird.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE \n\n  I took your guys advice and saw a point where you guys are coming from. I meet of with my friends for lunch. She had asked me if it was okay for him to come. I told her yeah, he can come. I congratulated her on dating him. How happy I\u2019m that they are finally together. She corrected me and said oh I\u2019m not with him. I\u2019m still with my boyfriend. I said okay, I totally get wanting to bring someone your comfortable with coming to the wedding. She said yeah, plus ex hook up kept asking me if he could be my plus one and he really wanted to go to the wedding. \n\nWhen I got home my fianc\u00e9 ended up telling me, he you know I thought about it and I don\u2019t really think I want him there. It makes me uncomfortable for him to be there. You know I don\u2019t like him and what he did in the past. I told him I understand, but I unfortunately already told her she could. There isn\u2019t really much we could do now. To just let it ride out. \n\n   To people saying I still have feeling for said guy, no I don\u2019t. Trust me I wouldn\u2019t be marrying my fianc\u00e9 if I wasn\u2019t 100% in love with him. I thought it was weird because I personally wouldn\u2019t want one of my fianc\u00e9 ex hook up there.  \n\nThank you to everyone who gave me advice, and to those wishing me a happy wedding\u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1687109626, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cq4xc/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_cant_bring_a_plus/", "score": 901, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why is this guy angling SO hard to come to your wedding? \n\nAt THIS point it\u2019s not longer about actually being an asshole to your friend, from her words it seems like she couldn\u2019t really care less and the ONLY reason she is bringing this guy is because he basically begged/hounded her to bring him. The only person getting \u201cscrewed\u201d here would be the creep who is trying to secretly finagle his way into your wedding. \n\nI feel like there is more here than just a sexual past given what your BF said. If that\u2019s the case, then revoke the invite.", "YWBTA.  You gave her a plus one, which leaves it up to her.  Had you invited her and her ex by name, things would be different.  But the plus one means she can invite whom she wants and you would need a really good reason to veto. And in this case, I don\u2019t think you have that.  Your fianc\u00e9 seems to not care, and you say you don\u2019t have any feelings for him. With everything that is going on, do you really think him being there would matter? I would think you would be too busy with the wedding for it to even impact you minimally.", "NTA - I'm glad everything has been worked out.", "Lol op made up the story that her fianc\u00e9 did a backsie. What a loser lol.", "NTA for the fact that this guy is not your friend's boyfriend and he was pressing her to take him to your wedding\n\nHis insistence of being at your wedding is weird and combined with SO not being comfortable with said hook up. \n\nI would hope your friend would understand. Especially if you are ok with her bringing her actual boyfriend. \n\nThis guy and situation are a no go for your wedding in my mind.", "What a mess, now your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t want him coming but there\u2019s nothing you go do about it? Lol. I don\u2019t know. ESH", "Yes YTA, and a jealous one at that. YOU don't want him there, and it kinda sounds to me like you wanted more with this guy at the time while he only saw you as a hookup. Your fiance is ok with him coming, and he is your friend's significant other, of course he should come. Don't try dressing it up like the only reason you want to exclude him is because it would be disrespectful to your fiance if he came, as it's pretty obvious what the real motives are lol.", "This is a bit of a mess.\n\nI think there's a distinction to be made here though. You told your friend she could bring someone with her, which that part never changed.\n\nThe issue was WHO that person would be.\n\nAt your wedding, you can decide if it's ok for someone to attend.\n\nYour friend could bring someone different.\n\nIf it was upsetting to your friend that she couldn't bring a particular person, that's understandable. Doesn't mean you were in the wrong.\n\nThe whole day is supposed to be designed to be as wonderful as possible for you and your spouse. If a particular person being there would make it less wonderful it's reasonable to exclude that person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "YTA.  For future reference, when a person is creating drama where there is none, that person is almost always the AH.", "\u201cShe said yeah, plus ex hook up kept asking me if he could be my plus one and he really wanted to go to the wedding\u201d\n\nNTA\n\nThis should disqualify the dude. He begged your friend to invite him. He is an ex-hook up. \n\nI find it odd that he \u201creally wanted to go\u201d. Especially since he isn\u2019t on friendly terms with your fianc\u00e9. Weird.", "It\u2019s your wedding fuck that guy", "I came home from lunch with my friends and my fianc\u00e9 now said yeah he actually does care if his there. I already told her she could bring him so I\u2019m just going to let things play out. Nothing much I can do now.", "Everyone is open to their opinions, I thought people would think that too haha. I did state in an other post he tends to be a people pleaser. It\u2019s something his working on.", "Want to be even more confused? Read the update.", "So I agree with everyone's take that YTA based on the initial information provided.\n\nBut the update gave me a weird feeling.\n\nShe's still with her boyfriend, but will bring your ex-hook up instead because *he asked her because he really wants to be at the wedding*? Now, THAT is a bit strange. \n\nEveryone assuming you were not over the guy and it turns ou he's the one who isn't over you which you might have had a gut feeling about. \n\nDid you ask why he wanted to be there so bad and why that trumped bringing her own boyfriend who you already know and she's supposedly in a long-term relationship with? How is the boyfriend ok with any of this anyway? \n\nJust food for thought.", "That\u2019s too bad that feels it will matter to him. But seriously, he is one random guy and you guys are having a wedding! Just treat him like a colleague\u2019s partner that you know in passing, acknowledge him when you are greeting guests, and then you are done with him.", "Yeah, someone pointed out that I could lose my friendship with her if I told her no. I didn\u2019t want to take that risk, it was an eye opener for me. Like other people said too we will probably will be having to much fun to even notice.", "Damn he jinxed it", "Seems like most comments I am reading were made before the OP added her update, cause it looks like I am the only one wondering why TF the ex-hook up (who is not actually dating the friend) insisted so much on attending the wedding?? Like maybe he\u2019s the one who\u2019s still not over her and might try to make a move or cause a scene??", "I don\u2019t get why anyone is saying you\u2019re the asshole, NTA from me. I think it\u2019s absolutely fair to say, \u201cHey, please don\u2019t bring that person I slept with/dated to my **wedding**.\u201d It would be one thing if everything was cool and the person was specifically invited, but as someone\u2019s plus one? Totally your right to say not to bring them.", "Yes, I was quite confused. If I'm understanding correctly, she is bringing this random guy friend, who previously hooked up with OP, as her plus one rather than her actual boyfriend?\n\nThat is extremely weird to me. Also, I feel like a \"plus one\" is expected to apply only to a romantic partner, not just a general pass to bring a friend. I guess you could argue it's the same effect in the end, but still, seems a bit rude of this guest in my opinion.", "For real. I met my husband through a really good college friend. She had been friends with him in high school and they had a bit of FWB. But clearly things between them didn't \"click\", so much that it never even got to a relationship status. So who cares?? I mean, I don't even care about his actual exes including an ex wife. Again, clearly the relationship didn't work and they broke up, so who gives a fuck if he talks to them or is friended on social media.", "It seems a bit weird that someone you used to sleep with, but neither you or fianc\u00e9 are friends with, really wants to go to your wedding...", "Nta, after the update. Just tell her no. That u have chanced ur minds and don't feel comfortable with him there. If she's really ur friends, she should understand.", "NTA\n\nFrom the update it sounds this ex of yours is still in to you. He is not dating your friend and he begged your friend to invite him. This is red flag territory \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nHave a private word with your friend, explain you said it was OK because you thought they were dating. \n\nExplain you and man went on a couple of dates before your relationship with fiance and after finding out that he specifically asked her to bring him to the wedding, you and your fiance are no longer comfortable with him being there.", "YES now the update is there with more context then I seriously think she\u2019s NTA now. \nThis doesn\u2019t make any sense now", "The update makes no sense and imo a +1 should really only be for SOs or at least \"dates\", right? Do people often just bring friends as a +1?", "Ikr the friend wants to bring hookup guy but actually is still dating her boyfriend?", "The real question is, did your boyfriend know about their flaw before you told him about what had been going down?  :-D", "If it's starting to show crack then she better get some sealant.  Problem solved!", "Hey OP, considering the update, the situation sounds like there is the potential for this ex to be disruptive.\n\nMaybe have an official \"disruption minimizer\" position to quickly escort disruptive entities out of the venue?\n\nThat way, you don't have to worry, and it will put your betrothed at ease about the situation.", "That edit makes it very clear NTA. This dude is being weird and creepy trying to get into a wedding he wasn\u2019t invited to. If you pointed that out to your friend then I\u2019m sure she would be fine not bringing him. You have extra information now and you\u2019re well within your rights to act on it.", "NTA why was he begging to come? And she\u2019s not even really dating him. Leave the invitation open for her bf that she\u2019s complicated with and say it was meant for him. How badly the ex wanted to go is a red flag", "I\u2019m so confused by everyone saying YTA. It\u2019s your wedding, literally the one life event where you should have almost total control who gets to come. I think it\u2019s totally understandable to not want an ex there. If it\u2019s gonna add any stress to your wedding day, just politely tell your friend you\u2019d prefer him not to come. It\u2019s your wedding day, enjoy and be surrounded by people you love and care about! NTA", "It seems weird to me that he wants to be there badly enough to ask his *not* girlfriend if he could be her plus one.. I guess NTA but just because it seems like he might have other weird motives", "YTA. I'm sorry, i just don't understand why this is such a big deal. Nor do i understand why you keep changing your mind", "There is an update?\n\nEdit: read update, have decided this is either fake, or OP is a bag of hammers."]}
