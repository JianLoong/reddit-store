Are you planning to request all your other guests with plus one's to get your approval for their guest? Why are you contemplating creating drama before your wedding?  Everyone else is on board and okay with Ms X's guest.", "YTA you told her she could bring a plus one and she probably didn\u2019t realize that that came with rules. You should\u2019ve explain to her that you get to decide who her plus one is.", " If your fiance said he doesn't care, and you don't care, what's the issue? Especially when you say you told her to date him? Unless I'm misunderstanding something I'd have to think yta for making an issue where there doesn't seem to be one.", "YTA, yes this situation is weird, but not for the reasons you are stating. It is weird because you are making it so by over thinking the whole thing and trying to assign the blame for this on everyone but yourself. You are uncomfortable having someone you had a brief intimate relationship with at your wedding. While understandable, to a point, that would still make you petty af to rescind a plus 1 two weeks before the event.", "So you and your friends *told* her to date the guy, now you're punishing her for dating the guy you told her to date. \n\nYta", "YTA if your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t care and everyone thinks they\u2019d be a good match what\u2019s the issue?

You even told her she should date him. Wtf. You say you have no feelings for him but I think that isn't quite true. This is going to be your wedding to another man who even said he didn't care if your friend brought him as a date. You refer to him as a mutual friend in your post so do you still consider him a friend? Do you hang out with him in other settings? Yes OP, YTA and the only weird part about this situation is your reaction to it.", "YTA. You're the only one who cares about this non-issue. Even your fiance doesn't care. You and your friends have told this woman she should date this guy, so now she is dating him. So, what exactly is the problem here? It sounds like you might be afraid that there will be weirdness if this guy comes to your wedding because of your brief past. You need to get over that, and quick. Your friend deserves to bring whoever she wants as a plus one, just like all of the couples who will be there. All you have to do if the two of them come over to congratulate you is smile and say thank you. It's not that hard. I'm sure this guy is simply happy that you've found a great guy who you want to share your life with, because unlike you, he's moved on from that brief fling from years ago.

I understand that you don't want any ex making your future husband uncomfortable . But damn then you say you encouraged her to date that guy . So it would be kind of an AH move to tell her no.\n\nI would talk to her and see if she could come without him since she know the past between you both and you just don't want to be disrespectful to your fianc\u00e9 .  It would be different if you did not have a past with this guy but in this case she should see that it could be awkward for everybody", "NTA\nI would feel weird. You like your friend, not her BF. If this is something that is going to make YOU feel uncomfortable at your wedding, you should be able to have it your way. You\u2019re not asking anything of her. She should respect your wishes and want to support you as a friend in any capacity", "YTA. There will be so many other things to focus on on your wedding day, ostracizing your friend for her choice of date (who you call a mutual friend) when you told her she could bring a plus one seems pretty extra.  You have your fianc\u00e9, who does not care despite not liking that person. You all told her to date him anyway, why now take issue with it? It makes me wonder if you really think it's rude and disrespectful to YOU, not your fianc\u00e9, since you're the one who seems bothered. Follow his lead and allow your friend her joy, you'll be busy enough with your own.", "You should have just said no, I'm not comfortable w someone I've had sex w at my wedding.  Instead of the whole I'll leave it up to hubby.  Now are you going to lie and say he said no?", "YTA. Your fiance is an adult *and the groom* . He can easily ignore the guy, and so can you. Focus on each other.", "YTA.  It\u2019s weird because you\u2019re making it weird, everyone else seems fine with the situation.", "YTA you and your husband will be so busy greeting other guests that this guy will be an afterthought. Especially if you\u2019re having a large wedding. Just remind your friend that he isn\u2019t your husband\u2019s favorite person and it would be best to keep some distance between them if you feel it\u2019s necessary.", "NTA but be honest - it\u2019s not that it\u2019s making your husband uncomfortable, it\u2019s more about your discomfort. That\u2019s okay and perfectly fair, but be honest with yourself and your friend.\n\nIe; hey, I just wanted to let you know - I put forward the plus one option to you when you\u2019d had a long term partner whom I was very aware of. However, considering circumstances have changed, I\u2019d feel more comfortable if you could come and support me at my wedding without a plus one, as I\u2019d really like this to be a more intimate affair to show with people I know well. I hope that\u2019s okay, and I completely understand if you\u2019d rather not come otherwise!", "YTA If you are over him , your partner doesn't care and you encouraged her to date him, how is this weird. Why are trying to create drama for your wedding?", "NTA. It's your wedding and you can have whoever you want there, especially because you're paying for it. Your friend knows you guys hooked up, and she should understand that it makes you uncomfortable.", "NTA your fiancee will not feel comfortable with a guest his bride gave a blow job to a while back and so disinviting him makes sense", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
