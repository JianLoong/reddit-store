So you gave him a sip, he hated it, and now he won't want it anymore. You should have cleared it with your first, though, so, there's that.", "You know, I was going to say Y T A, until I remembered that my folks did the same thing when I was 8.

It could cause the child harm\n\nTo the appropriateness of letting your kid try beer, it's not like you were getting the kid blitzed, just satisfying his curiosity with a single sip of beer. In parts of the world, they still let teething children suck on rags soaked in some alcohol spirit or another. It numbs the baby's gums and also calms them. This might be a bit overkill. \n\nInsofar as harming the kiddo goes, a single swallow wouldn't affect him at all. Additionally, he reacted exactly as you anticipated. Lesson learned.", "Sounds like he was determined to get a taste one way or another. You didn\u2019t put the curiosity about it into his head. I think you handled it well under the circumstances. A sip wasn\u2019t ever going to waste him.", "NTA. It's a pretty common thing for parents to let their kids try a sip. My parents did it to me, and I did it with my daughter. One small sip once is very different from a pattern of giving your kids booze.", "Nta. One of my first memories as a child is this exact situation and the exact same reaction.

You can\u2019t run every single parenting decision by committee.", "Oh ffs NTA. You gave him a sip and it went predictably as you expected. I did that when my kid was almost 4 for the same reason, and after he had his sip, he said, \"yum tasty!\" But he never asked for it again and he's now 18 and we all laugh at that story.", "NTA...us kids in the 70s and 80s all had a sip of beer.

You did good. 5 stars for you!", "I am surprised by people calling it abuse.  A sip to find out it\u2019s yucky isn\u2019t going to harm him in any way.

My mother did this with me and it kept me away from alcohol. I know lots of people whose parents did the same. I thought this was standard practice.", "NTA, we all (in our family i mean) tasted alcohol when we were kids, we were given a sip since we were curious. I don't drink at all as an adult and if you're given one sip it can't harm you in the moment. You can't run everything you do and say to your child by your spouse in case they don't agree, like how ridiculous would that be? If my child asks a question or asks to taste something new should I tell her to wait and go have a private meeting in the bedroom on how to answer / act in the moment?", "NTA. His curiosity is satiated for a good few years now", "NAH I fully see both sides of this and this is probably something you should\u2019ve run past her before doing it. I know you thought it was harmless but clearly she doesn\u2019t and you can\u2019t really blame a mother for being shocked by giving a 6 year old alcohol even if it was a completely harmless sip.", "NTA, you're actually doing something that European parents do on regular basis. It's always better for the child to learn from you while they're young so they wouldn't try to drink while you're not around. My grandfather did the same with his rakija (a much stronger alcoholic beverage, somewhat similar to vodka) when I was around 4 or 5. I was curious so he allowed me to dip my pinky in it and have a taste. It burned so bad that it made me gag and I still don't drink anything stronger than the occasional glass of red wine since then. So yeah, not only did you do the right thing in my eyes, but you potentially made your son realise that alcohol is yucky. Not to mention that he'd now trust you that he won't get in trouble if he drinks it and that takes away the forbidden fruit allure that alcohol usually has and makes it less likely for him to drink when he's older.", "NTA\nI was allowed sips.\n\nI hate alcohol to this day!", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you made him chug a bottle of jacks.", "NAH.  It's not uncommon to give little kids a sip, knowing the vast majority of the time they are going to absolutely hate it.  Now you know this is one thing mom feels different about than you and more strongly than most.  Maybe she's seen or known some who have had their lives destroyed by alcohol?  With these things best to let the partner with the greater emotional stake  win the day, since no one is objectively wrong or being harmful.", "NTA. Give the kid a kombucha and it'll be the same amount of alcohol. It's not a shot of vodka.  \nMy dad gave me a sip of a beer called \"hoptimum\" when the IPA craze was kicking off 10-15 years ago- and it was awful, same reaction as your kid. I cant drink an IPA to save my life at this point.. Everything's good in moderation, better to teach responsible consumption early IMO.", "Pffft! NTA. This is almost a parental right of passage. I don't know where all these snowflakes are coming from, but every kid I ever knew, including me and my siblings and many cousins, all did this, and none of us ended up in the hospital or alcoholics. We went through it with my kids, and all of my friends went through it with theirs. Same results. Plus, none of the spouses were upset because, you know why? We all trusted each other not to hurt the children. (Actually, they were upset more if they missed seeing the kids' faces when they spit out the drink.) It's a sip! Not a bottle! You're making OP sound like an alcohol pimp. Everyone freaking out needs to go cry to their therapist and get over themselves.", "This is pretty normal. \n\nNTA\n\nUpon reading other comments here you have 2 types of people with opposite opinions it appears.\n\nParents and non parents.", "NAH. We\u2019ve all had our sip of beer at 6 years old. Whether we stole it or it was given to us. But I do agree that maybe you should start keeping it in the garage. A year or so from now he might want to sneak another sip or maybe dare his friends to try it. Beer was always kept in the garage or basement fridge at our house growing up.", "ESH.

You gave alcohol to a 6-year-old? I don't care if it was just a sip, that's completely irresponsible. There's a reason we have laws against giving alcohol to minors.

I just mentioned how I had a taste of my grandfather's rakija when I was a kid and to this day I don't drink anything stronger than red wine because of how much it burned lol", "I loved sipping my Dad's beer when I was little and so did my brothers and sisters. If your going down in flames, you have company. We took a sip, we weren't slamming tall boys.", "100% agree.\n\nBefore my parents let me try beer, I got curious about a beer can one time and decided to try a sip when I was 5. Unbeknownst to me my grandpa had been using it as an ash tray. Got a mouthful of cigarette ash. XD", "Exactly, now the kid won\u2019t be tempted to try it again lol", "I thought so too before reading these comments. You\u2019d have thought he force fed the beer to the kid on comments alone.", "Yup!", "doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right or effective", "This. Imagine if you had to ask each other every time you feed someone something.", "Upvote this comment", "THIS \ud83d\udc4f", "We always had a small glass of wine with Thanksgiving dinner, and a sip of beer when my grandfather was making beer-batter fish. Not a big deal.", "Do you drink now?", "Forcing and allowing are different, though.", ">Plus, none of the spouses were upset because, you know why? We all trusted each other not to hurt the children. (Actually, they were upset more if they missed seeing the kids' faces when they spit out the drink.) \n\nSeriously. I don't even get all of the scolding comments saying \"you should have consulted your wife before you did this\".  It's a spontaneous thing, not something he planned out in advance.  BOTH parents need to have some level of trust in each other not to do something that would harm the child.  \"A tiny sip of beer so he knows it's bitter and yucky\" ought to fall under something that BOTH parents understand does not harm the child.\n\nHis wife's overreaction makes me think she's one of those parents who is hovering over her kid all the time trying to keep them from ever coming to the least little harm, or experiencing the least little setback or disappointment.  As a parent you need to be able to assess risk, too, and figure out what is important to worry about, and what isn't. Or you're going to drive yourself insane, AND you're going to raise a kid who reaches adulthood without knowing how to figure that out, either -- or handle small amounts of pain or disappointment.", "Which is which? I\u2019m a non parent and see no issue with this lol", "Beer does suck.", "Except his wife didn't tell him no beforehand. If she did, it's not mentioned here. Do you know OP's wife? \n\nNTA, OP. You did it once not expecting her strong reaction. I'm sure you didn't plan to do it again and now you know I'm advance for the new baby.", "He didn\u2019t know about his wife\u2019s feelings on the matter until after he\u2019d already done it, though. Considering how incredibly common it is for a parent to let their child try a sip at some point in their infancy, I\u2019m not surprised that OP didn\u2019t even consider his wife might have such a reaction.", "I think it's usually legal for kids to drink with their parents at home. Not everywhere.", "With so many hands, doesn't that make it more of a NAH or ESH situation?", "I mean like a lot of parents do this. I had a sip of wine when I was like 10", "Tell us you have no kids without telling us you have no kids.", "What? \ud83d\ude02 drinking alcohol fast and increased risk of addiction because he gave his kid a sip and the kid hated it?", "If that was true then everyone who grew up in the 90s and earlier would be raging alcoholics. That\u2019s just not supported.", "he just let the kid took a sip and now the kid knows that it taste like shit and will not want look forward to drinkin it in the future until he is an adult. just a tiny sip ur wife is trippin. NTA. it's against the law but it's just a tiny likkle sip bro not a whole fuckin can", "If he didn\u2019t like it OP doesn\u2019t have to give him more. We\u2019re talking about a 6 year old. It\u2019s not like he can walk down to the LCBO and buy himself more! He probably can\u2019t even fill his own cup without help from mom or dad. Yeesh. People acting like the alcohol is just laying around the house waiting for the kid to magically unlock manual dexterity and down some full bottles.", "Thank god he didn\u2019t mention the meth that he gave him\u2026 it\u2019s a sip of beer, relax", "In the US, many states allow family members to give alcohol to minors. In addition, there are exceptions for religious and other reasons.", "depends where you live, not everywhere has laws against it actually", "Kids not much older than 6 are being given sips of wine in church - why don't you go yell about that?", "Calm down America. You obviously haven't been to Europe ever.", "It wasn\u2019t \u201cserving\u201d alcohol. I gave my son a millisecond sip of beer.", "Except he didn't know how she felt until after the fact. Reading through these comments, it seems that this is commonplace, which explains why it didn't cross his mind to even ask in advance. \n\nIt would be one thing if they talked about it, she said she didn't want her children to have any and he did it anyway, but that's not what happened.", "There\u2019s kids facing actual abuse and you\u2019d waste CPS time with this?", "I liked plenty of things at 6 that I don\u2019t still like. And if he *did* like it, OP just doesn\u2019t have to give him more. He\u2019s 6. They still control what the kid eats and drinks. So at that point you just say no. It\u2019s not a big deal. In a few months kid would forget what it even tasted like or having tried it probably.", "Any particular reason?", "they don't know that drinking age is a modern concept, lol. i wonder how old were vking boys when they had their first mead or roman kids taki g sips of wine. people need to know the difference between dipping your tongue and going \"ewww\" and chugging beer can", "not got that far down the page yet but I bet they are almost all americans. Other countries have much more relaxed attitudes/laws regarding children and alcohol. They seem to take their \"no drinking under 21\" thing really seriously despite it being something promoted by some road safety campaign and states basically being heavily incentivised to make it law despite it not being mandatory for them to have this law. Other places eg britain it's legal to give a child alcohol on private property from 5 and children and teenagers are given wine or diluted wine with a fancy meal pretty commonly in much of europe. It's not like it turns most of the kids into raging alcoholics, quite the reverse, they learn to drink sensibly.", "Yeah it's really not as bad as people are making it out to be. Making it mysterious and untouchable is only going to make the kid want it more and more willing to deal with the taste to be cool and get drunk like everyone else when he gets older.\n\nYou have to give your kids a healthy amount of exposure to things, making it unobtainable is only going to make them more curious.", "Honestly I don't get it. They act like he gave him a shot of vodka.", "Also doesn't mean it's wrong just because you think it is. It's the same as letting the kid try food you know they will hate but won't stop asking for.", "It was more than effective for me! I never sipped another beer again! Still think it smells nasty, now I'd rather have cocktails since I'm \"old enough\" to drink", "Why would that matter, if they're an adult now?", "I'm reading all this people saying it should be a joint decision and wondering if I need to call my DH at work before I give the turdler dinner, since tonight's dinner is something new and *gasp* mildly spicy. And with a fair bit more planning going into it than giving a kid a 2 sec sip of beer in the moment.\n\nOP, NTA, but I think you married a helicopter. Good luck with that one.", "Legal in Texas.", "You know I thought about that, but that didn\u2019t quite feel right either. Like I don\u2019t necessarily feel like the wife was being an asshole, just maybe a bit unreasonable. But I also don\u2019t wanna say \u201cno assholes here\u201d, because given how controversial this topic clearly is, it seems in hindsight he definitely should have spoken to her. So I went with a soft Y T A\n\nEdit: I should note that at the time I left the comment, most of the comments declared him the asshole and many of them seemed to think this was basically abuse. While I didn\u2019t agree with them, the fact that it was so controversial did me pause, because anything that people feel _that_ strongly about surely seems worthy of at least a discussion. I wanted to mention this because now that it\u2019s gotten more comments, most people seem to think he\u2019s _not_ the asshole, so someone reading my comment might not know the context leading me to call it \u201ccontroversial\u201d", "And now look at you, a redditor!", "Nobody can say that the child will not consume alcohol before he is an adult, but what is certain is that his father introduced him to alcohol and is more likely to end up an alcoholic. The fact that a law was created does not come from nowhere", "You can belly up to a bar at 16 or something with your parents in Wisconsin.", "this is technically abuse?", "I'm doing research", "Kids in Europe drink wine at home and most of them don't become alcoholics. If people became alcoholics because they had alcohol as a child, pretty much every kid that attended a Catholic or Episcopalian church would be an alcoholic.", "Where are the stats showing a kid who sips alcohol is more likely to grow up and become an alcoholic?", "To answer your question: no.", "It is a stupid thing to do, but it's not abuse.", "Well, I hope you post your results!\n\nFor your research: my dad definitely gave me a little sip of his beer when I was like 6 or so.  Bitter!  Hated it. Yuck.\n\nYes, I drink now.  Mostly beer, lol.  (I like wine okay. I like mixed drinks okay. My default is beer.)\n\nBut, my palate is still more anti-bitter than not.  All beer is going to be somewhat bitter, and \"sharp\" with the alcohol flavor, but like, I don't like hoppy IPAs.  I like mellower, \"sweeter\" dark beers, like stouts.  Has it been made in some gimicky way with coffee or chocolate or maple syrup or whatever?  Give it to me.  Last night I drank a S'mores Stout. It was great, I gotta go buy an actual six-pack.\n\n(I also was drinking in the year before my 21st birthday.  Not a lot, though.  I never drink very much.  And I didn't go to a college where there was an underage-drinking culture.)", "I don't know where you live but in France children don't drink at home. I am not saying that they automatically become alcoholic if they drink alcohol but that there is an increased risk of alcohol", "Where YOU live in France, perhaps not. Can you speak for the whole country?", "I had lessons on this subject so I think so"]}
