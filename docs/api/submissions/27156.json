Taking in a traumatized 13-year-old boy is a LOT to handle, even for someone who doesn't have other kids, and considering you have a baby on the way it would be wildly irresponsible of you to take him in. \n\nIn addition to the fact that he's going to require a lot more time and attention than a normal 13yo which would be impractical with a newborn as well, 13 is getting to the point where he's strong enough to do real damage if he turns violent. You definitely need to protect yourself and your family in this situation.", "NTA, OP, Placement with you is no different than a foster placement, as you don't know this nephew and he does not know you. Additionally, he would be moving far away from his siblings and mother. We don't have information here about the nature of the family's problems, however I speculate that it may be better if your nephew has the possibility of retaining some contact with his siblings. Realistically, your nephew may be better served by staying close to where his siblings are living. To him you are a random stranger.", "NTA\n\nWhile it would be nice, it\u2019s not your responsibility to take in a child unknown to you at such a critical juncture. Are there no other family members who can help?", "Nta", "Is the best thing for the kid to be taken in by a family member?: Probably yes. Kinship care tends to be more stabilizing for kids who are taken from their parents. Even though most of the family doesn't know him, it would still likely provide the best possible outcome for your teenaged nephew than foster care with complete strangers or a group home.\n\nMight it cause disruption in the family that takes him in? Also probably yes. Maybe a small disruption, or maybe a massive disruption. It's impossible to know.\n\nSo, this is a very hard decision. I hope it works out for the best for all of you.", "Meet the child before you write him off as hopelessly damaged. You're not required to take him in, but don't pretend it's because your sister told him lies about the family, etc. There are ALWAYS lots of unknowns to deal with - there will be many with your own baby too. \n\nNAH", "NTA. I worked with teens for several years in a public school setting and can confirm that your nephew will almost certainly require far more attention and care than a typical young teenager. He deserves a family who loves him, but more importantly, adults who can meet him where he is. If you and your spouse aren't able to offer him that level of support right now, you'd be doing him a disservice by taking him in.\n\nI don't know if it's an option where you live, but if you want to be involved in your nephew's life, you can inform the social worker who contacted you that you are unable to offer your home at present, but would like to be in contact and try to build a relationship with him. He might not want that and he might be angry at you, but giving him the option to have that family connection could help.", "Look into boarding schools. Some states have public boarding schools - they are good quality schools and would provide stability for him in a way you can't. Maybe you can take him in during the summer and the holiday breaks.", "NTA. I wish we lived in a better world where people could agree to take in a traumatized teenager and get the support they need. If we lived in that world, where taking in children was not a huge burden, I'd say that you had a duty to do it. But that's not this world. I think it would be a bit cruel if you specifically disavowed even meeting him, but not being in a position to take in a teenager that is going to have a lot of special needs when you've never even raised a child before doesn't make you an asshole.", "NTA.

Frankly, I\u2019m surprised they want to place him with you if there is a new baby coming soon. Generally speaking, quite a few social workers don\u2019t recommend this kind of situation because the child needs stability. You need to be able to dedicate time & resources to his care to make sure he is getting the help he needs.\n\nIf possible, I would be asking for more information about any psychological assessments & similar things that may have taken place when he was removed from her care. I believe that before you even consider taking him in, you should at least know what you may be able to expect. Simply put, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA or that you\u2019re being unreasonable. As he doesn\u2019t know you, I wouldn\u2019t think this much/if any different from going to a foster placement. Are there other family members or your parents who would be able to take him in?", "NTA. Your immediate family and pregnancy come first. This kid is bad news and you don't need to be around his stress when you are having a baby.", "It is not possible to be the AH here. No one is ever obligated to accept this responsibility.", "NTA not your kids, not your obligation regardless of familial ties or trauma. No one is entitled to your help like that.", "Kind of where my head is at too but sadly still trouble moral ethical and emotional side of it all with AITA for abandoning family.", "Parents are deceased sadly and most older relatives are at the age where idk if they'd want to take in a teen.", "State sent out letters to all known family but many are older or have young kids themselves. Also most of the family hasn't known this child for 10 plus years either.", "Parents sadly are both deceased or they would have taken him in in a heart beat. I know multiple relatives have received letters and I'm sure there will be multiple reaching out to me to talk and ask questions.", "NTA and blood ties aren\u2019t what makes a family, not in the real sense of the word imho. \n\nDoes his life suck? Probably, but my question is why they are only removing one out of four?  I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s the one getting into trouble therefore may have behavioural issues? Either way, definitely not what you need bringing a new squish into the world.", "I\u2019m so sorry. As someone who took in a problematic relative and suffered gravely, your reservations are valid. Just because you share generic relations form not me you have to throw yourself on the sacrificial fire. These are the consequences of your sister\u2019s choices, decisions, and mistakes. You are starting your own family. Infants are a lot of responsibility. Post-partum is unpredictable. Obviously we are not the same, but I\u2019ll say this, my relative ruined our experience of my first child\u2019s birth. The stress, dreams and upset was devastating. It is something that can never be undone. Years spent embroiled in trying to do the right thing and step up for the failures of other family members only made my life traumatic and ultimately destroyed relationships. If I could rewind the clock, I would have said no. My heart was big, but the reality was devastating. Maybe it would be different for you.", "If most of the family is in the same boat as you in this, I see no reason why you specifically are the AH. Hopefully the kid can get a loving family that he deserves.", "He likely won\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean OP needs to take him, but there\u2019s no need to lie to themselves."]}
