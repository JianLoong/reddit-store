Taking in a traumatized 13-year-old boy is a LOT to handle, even for someone who doesn't have other kids, and considering you have a baby on the way it would be wildly irresponsible of you to take him in. \n\nIn addition to the fact that he's going to require a lot more time and attention than a normal 13yo which would be impractical with a newborn as well, 13 is getting to the point where he's strong enough to do real damage if he turns violent. You definitely need to protect yourself and your family in this situation.", "NTA, OP, Placement with you is no different than a foster placement, as you don't know this nephew and he does not know you. Additionally, he would be moving far away from his siblings and mother. We don't have information here about the nature of the family's problems, however I speculate that it may be better if your nephew has the possibility of retaining some contact with his siblings. Realistically, your nephew may be better served by staying close to where his siblings are living. To him you are a random stranger.", "NTA\n\nWhile it would be nice, it\u2019s not your responsibility to take in a child unknown to you at such a critical juncture. Are there no other family members who can help?", "Nta", "Is the best thing for the kid to be taken in by a family member?: Probably yes. Kinship care tends to be more stabilizing for kids who are taken from their parents. Even though most of the family doesn't know him, it would still likely provide the best possible outcome for your teenaged nephew than foster care with complete strangers or a group home.\n\nMight it cause disruption in the family that takes him in? Also probably yes. Maybe a small disruption, or maybe a massive disruption. It's impossible to know.\n\nSo, this is a very hard decision. I hope it works out for the best for all of you.", "Meet the child before you write him off as hopelessly damaged. You're not required to take him in, but don't pretend it's because your sister told him lies about the family, etc. There are ALWAYS lots of unknowns to deal with - there will be many with your own baby too. \n\nNAH", "NTA. I worked with teens for several years in a public school setting and can confirm that your nephew will almost certainly require far more attention and care than a typical young teenager. He deserves a family who loves him, but more importantly, adults who can meet him where he is. If you and your spouse aren't able to offer him that level of support right now, you'd be doing him a disservice by taking him in.\n\nI don't know if it's an option where you live, but if you want to be involved in your nephew's life, you can inform the social worker who contacted you that you are unable to offer your home at present, but would like to be in contact and try to build a relationship with him. He might not want that and he might be angry at you, but giving him the option to have that family connection could help.", "Look into boarding schools. Some states have public boarding schools - they are good quality schools and would provide stability for him in a way you can't. Maybe you can take him in during the summer and the holiday breaks.", "NTA. I wish we lived in a better world where people could agree to take in a traumatized teenager and get the support they need. If we lived in that world, where taking in children was not a huge burden, I'd say that you had a duty to do it. But that's not this world. I think it would be a bit cruel if you specifically disavowed even meeting him, but not being in a position to take in a teenager that is going to have a lot of special needs when you've never even raised a child before doesn't make you an asshole.", "NTA.

Frankly, I\u2019m surprised they want to place him with you if there is a new baby coming soon. Generally speaking, quite a few social workers don\u2019t recommend this kind of situation because the child needs stability. You need to be able to dedicate time & resources to his care to make sure he is getting the help he needs.\n\nIf possible, I would be asking for more information about any psychological assessments & similar things that may have taken place when he was removed from her care. I believe that before you even consider taking him in, you should at least know what you may be able to expect. Simply put, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA or that you\u2019re being unreasonable. As he doesn\u2019t know you, I wouldn\u2019t think this much/if any different from going to a foster placement. Are there other family members or your parents who would be able to take him in?", "NTA. Your immediate family and pregnancy come first. This kid is bad news and you don't need to be around his stress when you are having a baby.", "It is not possible to be the AH here. No one is ever obligated to accept this responsibility.", "NTA not your kids, not your obligation regardless of familial ties or trauma. No one is entitled to your help like that.", "Kind of where my head is at too but sadly still trouble moral ethical and emotional side of it all with AITA for abandoning family.", "Parents are deceased sadly and most older relatives are at the age where idk if they'd want to take in a teen.", "State sent out letters to all known family but many are older or have young kids themselves. Also most of the family hasn't known this child for 10 plus years either.", "Parents sadly are both deceased or they would have taken him in in a heart beat. I know multiple relatives have received letters and I'm sure there will be multiple reaching out to me to talk and ask questions.", "NTA and blood ties aren\u2019t what makes a family, not in the real sense of the word imho. \n\nDoes his life suck? Probably, but my question is why they are only removing one out of four?  I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s the one getting into trouble therefore may have behavioural issues? Either way, definitely not what you need bringing a new squish into the world.", "I\u2019m so sorry. As someone who took in a problematic relative and suffered gravely, your reservations are valid. Just because you share generic relations form not me you have to throw yourself on the sacrificial fire. These are the consequences of your sister\u2019s choices, decisions, and mistakes. You are starting your own family. Infants are a lot of responsibility. Post-partum is unpredictable. Obviously we are not the same, but I\u2019ll say this, my relative ruined our experience of my first child\u2019s birth. The stress, dreams and upset was devastating. It is something that can never be undone. Years spent embroiled in trying to do the right thing and step up for the failures of other family members only made my life traumatic and ultimately destroyed relationships. If I could rewind the clock, I would have said no. My heart was big, but the reality was devastating. Maybe it would be different for you.", "If most of the family is in the same boat as you in this, I see no reason why you specifically are the AH. Hopefully the kid can get a loving family that he deserves.", "He likely won\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean OP needs to take him, but there\u2019s no need to lie to themselves.", "NTA. Don't do it.  You don't even know what kind of trauma he was exposed to.  Which, in turn, he could expose your child to.", "Nta, however you could and should get more info from the social worker about why he was removed from his mother's care and if they expect he will be able to go back, what kind of contact he is to have with her, and separately his siblings. Are they considering removing his siblings. Why. Why not? (Would they also expect/want you to take them? What is his school situation. Was he never sent to school or did he leave once there. Is he behind? Since the pandemic or since before? What is his education like. Where would he need help.\n\nYou should also find out from the state what resources would be available (what is offered to kinship carers varies.) Would he be given psychiatric help? extra educational assistance? Would you receive a foster care allowance? Would he be in foster care would you be given guardianship?\n\nYou can also ask to speak to him, perhaps via zoom and ask him about his life, what he knows about you and the extended familiy etc. And general stuff whatbis he interested in. Any extra curricular activities  \n\nMaybe what he needs is stability and kindness, maybe he needs a lot more. Do due diligence before refusing.", "Why can\u2019t you meet the child and see how that goes before assuming he is damaged? Personally, I wouldn\u2019t say no but maybe your morals are different than mine.", "NAH, but meet the kid first and see what he's like before you decide he's a danger to your family. I would also discuss with the social worker to see what the best options are for him to get help and to get a fully honest evaluation of his behavior.", "There're a lot of comments taking about how much attention this kid will need,  all the issues he'll have.  But really,  you have no idea what he's like. He could be a shy quiet bookworm who just wants a warm bed and an escape from his mother.  Kids aren't just a sum of their parents issues.  \n\nHas he been evaluated? Have you spoken to the social workers about his personality,  his level of needs? About the exact reasons he was taken away? \n\nYou're not obligated to do anything.  No one's obligated to do anything,  really.  But life isn't just about only doing what you're \"obliged\" to do.  There's a scared kid who has no idea what will happen to him,  who's spent his life surviving his mother's mercurial whims,  and who has a bunch of living relatives who are all refusing to so much as meet him. \n\nYou have an opportunity to make someone's life better. If he's a pathological liar with a propensity for making nipple belts and eating the neighbors cats,  I'm fairly certain you can put him back in the system.  \n\nIf you were in his position,  how would you hope people would treat you? Or your future child? At some point or other in our lives,  we all depend on the mercy of others. His mother hasn't shown him much.  It's up to you.  But at least find out something about the kid before he's thrown to the wolves.", "NTA. You cannot possibly care for a disturbed young man as a new father. You are protecting your family.  Hard NO.", "Personally, YTA. I just don\u2019t understand how anyone, knowing all that you do about your sister, would let those kids remain with her for any period of time. \n\nI could never sit around and let any of that happen to a kid in my life. Never. And I likely feel this way because I was that kid. My mom and me/her kids suffered at the hand of an abusive alcoholic/druggie father and my mom\u2019s family just stood by and let it happen because \u201cit\u2019s none of their business.\u201d They should have done something. Thankfully we got lucky and my dad got deported after being arrested when I had to call the police at 10 years old on him because he threatened us. \n\nYeah, I could never sit around and let that happen. My siblings know this too and they know I will not stand by if they ever tried acting like our dad towards a woman. \n\nYou knew all that you did about your sister and you stood by and let it happen. Now you think you have zero responsibility for a kid that you contributed to fucking up by standing on the sidelines letting him get traumatized. YTA. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA: because obviously refusing to take care of another human being that you don't owe  responsibility to would imply that. You don't have autonomy, so this is obvious.\n\nThe circle jerk here is wrong this time, sorry pal.", "YTA but it's understandable.  My take, having been through a somewhat similar situation with my nephew, is that yes there are a lot of unknowns and quite probably he will bring some trouble that you didn't ask for.  But the flip side is you can be the person to finally bring some stability into this young person's life.  None of this is his fault and he deserves to at least have a chance at a normal life.", "NTA\n\nYes, you are related to this child but your home might not be the right fit. This boy has gone through a lot and he needs stability. At this point, you\u2019re going to have a big change with the new baby. He is also going to need counseling and other supports. It might be too much for you and your wife to balance his needs with the needs of your new baby.", "NTA but\u2026If it was me I would maaaybe meet him and foster to see if it was ok", "NTA, with what he has been through he needs major care and mental health counseling.  Most of all with not knowing how he acts you have no way to protect a newborn from him.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019d need to divert your attention to either him or your wife and baby, you can\u2019t do both. It\u2019d be unfair to him and your family if you took him in.", "NTA ofc.\n\nHowever maybe meet the kid before you write him off. I know life is tough for you, but I bet it's a lot tougher for him and maybe having an uncle in his life might change that. Ofc you dont have to tho", "NAH, other than your sister of course.\n\nbut I would hope you would take the opportunity to talk to the social worker handling this case to learn more about your nephew\u2019s needs, personality, issues, etc. first before making a final decision.", "NTA. Don\u2019t raise a child unless you are 1,000% sure you want to. Sometimes, it\u2019s better not to raise a child if your have doubts.", "NTA you gonna have baby soon with mean you can't spend enough time with your nephew. Your wife will to busy with baby she can't help you with nephew too.", "You have to be able to live with your choices. Personally, if I could afford to financially support and house the nephew, I would at least talk with my spouse, meet with the nephew, talk to him and also have a very in depth discussion with his case workers about the support he needs and is available rather than just abandoning him to the foster care system. I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror if I abandoned nephew without even looking into it. \n\nHaving said that, it is more harm than good for the nephew to be taken in by someone who doesn't want him. You might want to be a good person but resentment is inevitable if you didn't want to take him in to begin with. So if you don't want him, you shouldn't take him in. But you have to live with the knowledge that you made that choice and it was the right decision for you.", "NTA. It\u2019s a heartbreaking situation but you have have to do what is best for you child and family.", "NTA. I\u2019m very concerned that he is the only one being removed from the home. If the mother were endangering the kids, they\u2019d all be going into the system. What is it about this 13 year old specifically that requires his removal from being around 3 younger siblings? I wouldn\u2019t feel safe having this kid around my fragile newborn baby and my post-partum wife. They\u2019re too vulnerable, and the situation would be too volatile when everyone is sleep deprived and all the attention is focused on taking care of the baby. This kid is a teenager and coming into his physical strength. If he has a violent temper, it only takes one moment to do irreparable harm. It\u2019s sad and I hope he gets the help he needs but the place for that isn\u2019t your home.", "NTA. Say no and have no guilt about it. This is not your responsibility. Your responsibility is to your spouse and new baby.", "Well... that's not really true. I agree NTA, but placement with OP is HUGELY different from a foster placement. A foster placement could involve anything, including abuse.", "Can\u2019t believe I had to scroll this far to find this answer. \n\nOP, NTA, but at least give the kid a chance before you write him off. I get that not everyone is cut out for adoption or similar situations but you do owe it to yourself and the kid to at least meet him. This will also help clear any lingering dilemmas. If he\u2019s as bad as you think he\u2019d be, it\u2019s fair enough to not take him in (albeit still very sad\u2026), but you never know. He might just be a good kid in a bad situation. I think meeting him will help you solidify your decision.", "eh maybe if he didnt have a baby on the way. his child is way more important. too much of a risk.", "This\u2026", "I agree with not having your child subject to the stress that will come with having an unknown teenager in the home.", "The family is complete strangers as well.  Most of all OP will soon have a newborn in the house that she needs to protect.", "I wish this too. \n\nI want to adopt but im afraid of not being equipped to help a traumatized child.", "It has nothing to do with morals.  Taking care of a newborn - especially as a new first time  parent - is very time consuming and stressful.  She does not need to take on any additional responsibilities and it does not make her a bad, immoral person to focus on bonding with her own child.  Her primary responsibility is to the baby she chose to bring into this world.", "Wow - way to pile on the guilt.  I think her concerns are legitimate, and it\u2019s best he be placed with a family who has experience with kids in his age group.", "And no other relatives to take him? I hope someone would at least connect with his social worker or give him their phone number in case he faces similar abuse in foster care. You are NTA for not taking him in given the new baby but I would hope he has some kind of lifeline", "So you're saying that family members wouldn't abuse the 13 YO??? Not that I'm saying OP is an abuser, just that you seem to believe families don't abuse.", "I don\u2019t think OP owes it to the kid or himself or anyone", "He needs to be where he can get the mental health care for everything he has been through.  This is not with an untrained family member.", "As mentioned, even though most of the family doesn't know the nephew, being taken in by kin still tends to result in the most stable outcomes for a child. Foster care, especially for a teenager, is rough.\n\nOne summer I worked on a farm, and one of the neighboring farms took in a lot of foster kids. The reason the kids were taken in there wasn't out of love from the family. The teenagers were the farm's labor.\n\nAnd that was one of the better places for teenagers to get placed.\n\nETA: While it may not seem likely, it's also possible that this nephew could bond well with the baby cousin, and be a help to the parents.", "Usually they remove one because they are getting the brunt of the abuse and are often the target, but it can also be he\u2019s reacting more negatively than the other kids so they are hoping removing him will give him a chance to get the help he needs, but I do not think OP is wrong for saying no, he likely needs a high amount of care and that\u2019s just not an option at OP\u2019s house, he needs to be somewhere that he can get what he needs", "Happy cake day.", "No, of course I don't believe that. I'm saying that OP knows if he's an abuser or not; and if he's a good man, then there is actually a big difference between placements.", "Yeo and he is the only child taken away from the mother.  If there were issues with mom all the kids would be taken.  God only knows why he is taken away.  She needs to protect her newborn not endanger her child.", "Hmmmm caaake\u2026.. thanks, I didn\u2019t notice lol"]}
