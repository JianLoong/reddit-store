How about you go to the dean and complain? Where I am from, it is prohibited for private educational institutions to make contributions for extracurricular activities mandatory, and violators of this would affect the school's credentials and license to continue operating.", "NTA. So let me get this straight. They are throwing a party and want people to pay to attend and then also demand that those that are not attending pay too? Unless it effects your grade or graduating then no dont pay. Isnt tuition and alumni donations supposed to help pay for stuff like that?", "NTA. This makes no sense, I\u2019ve never heard of mandatory party fees before at a school. This sounds like extortion. \n\nI would complain to the dean that this type of extortion is unacceptable.", ">However, some time into the preparations, they said that those who would not to attend would have to pay nonetheless. \n\nNTA. Here's what happened: not enough people bought tickets to fund the event, so they got desperate. Making everyone pay regardless if they want to come serves two purposes for them: it raises more money and guarantees a full house when everyone thinks \"well, I've paid for it, might as well go.\" Don't pay them, their poor planning isn't your fault.", "NTA. You're absolutely right, this makes no sense whatsoever. Why pay for something you're not going to attend, especially when you're tight on money? I'd honestly be a little sketchy of this expectation.", "NTA. I would be eager to see the Dean to let them know that some students were extorting money from the entire class.", "NTA.\n\nThis is not a matter of tuition, or extra lab fees that were added on based on which classes you were taking.  Those are taken care of by the Bursar.\n\nIf this was a mandatory thing they would have the Bursar add it to your account.  So this is a volunteer activity.  They hoped to get more participation but your classmates weren't all that into this party so now the organizers have gotten more aggressive.\n\nThis \"naming and shaming\" thing would have me refusing to pay even if I had the money to spare.  I'd probably stand up in class and shame them back for trying to extort money out of me.  If they try to do this again at the start of the exam I would be LIVID.\n\nI'm guessing that the \"talk with the dean\" is a bluff, but if it's not then you should take the opportunity to talk to the dean about how inappropriate it is to use class time for fundraising.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't know these people and it doesn't sound like you're going to know them in the future, so don't sweat it. I assume someone one the planning committee blew out the budget and now they just want to pressure other people into paying.", "\"they said that those who would not to attend would have to pay nonetheless. \" ..

If you end up in the dean's office tell them you don't have extra funds for parties that have no baring on your education.\n\nI really doubt there's going to be any reprocussions, but don't allow them to extort money out of you that you don't have", "NTA How is this even possible? Very silly thing for the party planners to do?", "NTA  That's absurd. You don't owe the school or its staff a goddamn thing. You pay to go there! If they don't have enough for their party, that's their problem. It's not part of the curriculum and you didn't agree to pay for shit.\n\nI'd be so pissed.

Go to the dean and complain about the harassment.", "WNBTA The people who are organizing this need to go take a running jump off a short pier. What they are doing is ugly and unfair.

It's no accident that they wrapped the party money and the gift money into one payment, with no break down.

Sure, you talk to that dean and you say what I said above.
