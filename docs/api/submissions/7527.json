She didn't like the idea of him going out with us, and said I had to stay home and it would only be for for an HR or two. I told her no, I wanted to go out with my friends n drink, she'd have to find someone else. She went on this rant how she does so much for me and never ask much, and that I was being an AH. It is true, she supports me financially and I practically live for free and she is incredibly helpful but I feel I shouldn't have to watch her son.

She supports you financially and you practically live for free, but you can't be bothered to watch her kid for a couple of hours so she can go to an appointment? Wow.

Your girlfriend doesn't ask for much and the one thing she does ask, you can't do.  This is what life is when you get into a relationship with someone who has a kid (yours or someone else's).

You were really going to take her son and go out and drink and probably drive? WTF were you thinking? NM you weren\u2019t thinking. Between that and the fact you are mooching off of this single mom, caused her to miss her appointment , among probably a bunch of other shady shit you do. She should cut her losses now.

Appointment so most likely during the day so you can't wait an hour to day drink? And if she pays for everything how do you have money to go out?", "YTA and a pathetic moocher at that. Let me get this right. You live there *checks notes* for FREE. Your girlfriend provides for you financially, and all she asked was for you to watch her child for 1 hour 2 max. Instead, you determine that drinking with your buddies is a better use of your time. Buddy, she's being distant because you're gonna have to most likely find a new living area soon. But hey! At least you can go and drink with your friends as much as you like after!", "YTA and are not mature enough to be in a relationship with anyone, much less someone with a child. She has two children. The least you can do is help her out while you mooch off of her.", "YTAAAAAAA\nYou say you practically live for free??? This woman who already has a child is taking care of you like you're a kid??? Bc you are a kid. If you don't want to be a step dad don't date a woman with kids. \nGrow up.", "YTA. You\u2019re taking advantage of her and not providing anything in return. You\u2019re dating a woman with a kid and you don\u2019t get to ignore the fact that she has a kid.\n\nFor her sake I hope that soon you have the title of ex-boyfriend, and you get tossed out on your butt like you deserve.", "YTA. She's basically paying your way and you don't want to watch the kid? I'd be kicking you straight out of the house.\n\nGo be lazy somewhere else.", "YTA...but this cannot be real.

She supports you financially and you can\u2019t watch her son for an hour so that she can go to the doctor? Because you want to go out drinking? What time of day was this? Most doctors don\u2019t have evening appointments.", "I was going to say N T A but when I read that you\u2019re basically a freeloader then YTA.

I won\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re putting the \u201cno one will love you because you have a kid\u201d card against her so you can do what you want. Either way, it\u2019s disgusting. If you\u2019re serious about her then her kid will eventually be a part of your life so you need to at least pull your weight especially when you\u2019re being a dead weight. \n\nAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself? She\u2019s a single mom and it\u2019s already hard for her and you\u2019re just another mouth to feed.", "YTA and you sound like a leach. You couldn\u2019t wait an hr or 2 to drink? During day time hours ??", "YTA. She has a kid and you signed up for that when you decided to date her. That\u2019s your own fucking fault.

Everything she wants deserves and needs! Prince fucken charming.", "YTA. She financially supports you and she asks you to baby sit for a few hours and you thought it was appropriate to drink with your mates while watching the child?!?

I hope she realizes soon enough what a freeloader you are.", "YTA, obviously. The classic advice to not date someone with kids if you can\u2019t handle having a partner with kids rings true.

She deserves way better YTA", "You live rent free?\n\nNot for much longer\n\n\nYTA", "If it\u2019s a serious relationship with the intentions of being married, YTA since you would be stepping into a fatherly role for the kid.

I\u2019d boot you to the curb.", "YTA\n\nYour girlfriend is very young to have a 22 year old son...\nYou treat her like she's your mom and your a cranky teenager  , she pays all your stuff and you get mad when she asks for help for important things because you need to go out with your friends ...

Don't date someone with kids if you have no interest in helping them take care of said kids.", "You're not an ass hole for not wanting to watch her kid, but YTA for being a freeloading dick.

It sounds like you live on her dime and don\u2019t have much responsibility for yourself or your own expenses. So you\u2019re essentially dating a single mother and acting like a second child for her to deal with. So when she came to you with a legitimate need (Like a doctors appointment that are hard to take children to and focus on what you are being told) that would take an hour maybe 2 of your time you\u2019re telling me that because you couldn\u2019t take a 4 year old to a bar with you so you could drink (because why tf would you agree to watch a child of any age and plan to drink aka not be responsible for said child) you threw a fit after already agreeing (of your own free will mind you) to watch her child, retracted your agreement to watch said child last minute and made her miss her appointment. What the actual fuck dude. \n\nSo here are your opinions as to not be the asshole again. #1 You can stop dating women with kids because clearly you aren\u2019t ready to provide any kind of support for your significant other in their needs as a parent because whether you like it or not dating a parent means that you are going to be involved in those children\u2019s lives in some way and if you really love the person you\u2019re dating it\u2019s not a chore to help them with their kids \n\n                               OR \n#2 You can grow the fuck up and help your gf with her son when she asks for help because you love her and realize that she and her kid come as a package deal and respect that. You even admitted that she doesn\u2019t ask you for much but she trusted you to be a responsible adult and watch her kid for an hour or 2 which in the grand scheme of things is a really short amount of time so she could meet a need of hers and go to a doctors appointment without having to chase her child around. You willfully chose to date a woman who has a child and that kid needs her for so much so you agreeing to take a massive weight off her shoulders by watching that baby for a couple hours over going out drinking with your friends means so much to her and speaks to the person you are to her. That she can trust you with her child, that you respect her as a mother but you also respect her as the person she is and will be her teammate in life which includes her child.", "you're dating a mom who supports and allows you to live for free and you can't bother to babysit for a DOCTORs appointment? of course yta", "I hope she breaks up with this jerk.", "Wow YTA.

She would be much better off without this albatross around her neck.\n\nYTA.", "Wanting a father for her son.\n\nThe thing is, I can't even fault OP.  He's only 22.  They're just incompatible.", "Uh, 22 is plenty old enough to know better than behave like this. OP is just being irresponsible and immature. He shouldn't be reliant on his 20 year old girlfriend for financial support.", "No, it's called lonely and this guy is what she thinks she deserves. She'll leave him and soon.", "I've heard it must be a whole lot of money or a whole lot of d*ck.\ud83e\udd14", "This is exactly what OP needs to hear. YTA, but You're also apparently good in bed.", "She\u2019s younger than him", "I sure hope so. She\u2019s way too young to be settling for so little."]}
