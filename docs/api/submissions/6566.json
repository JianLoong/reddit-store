Maybe this has been a lifelong dream of his, to have a son.\n\nNow obviously the hope is that he does not play favorites, but until the kids get to that age, you're not going to know if he will do that or not.\n\nIf you ban him from his own child's birth, YTA\n\nAlso: If I've learned anything from the amount of couple's therapy I've gone through with my own wife, it's that any kind of withholding techniques used as punishment toward a partner (i.e. not talking, withholding affection, not allowing into space, etc.) only *ever* makes your partner resent you that much more.\n\nIs that really how you want your son's life to start?  \n\n\nEdit to add: PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMENTING:  \nSince so many people mistakenly seem to think I am saying this woman should be \"over the moon\" or \"falling at his feet\" for doing what they are calling the \"bare minimum\", allow me to clarify what I meant when I offered the perspective above:  \n\n\nAppreciation goes a long way, and sets the tone for a better relationship. When my wife shows appreciation for even the most basic things, it actually makes me feel good and therefore more motivated to do bigger and better things, and vice versa when I show my appreciation for her. \n\n  \nThe lack of appreciation, or taking things for granted, sows the seeds for resentment and has quite the opposite effect. If even the little things aren't appreciated why should I bother to try and do more?\n\n  \nAny marriage counselor or couple that has been married a long time can tell you this. The little things really do matter.   \n\n\nOP's concerns are totally valid, but her reaction is not. Rather than jump straight to punishing a man who is present and trying, (for something he hasn't done yet)  OP needs to TALK with her husband and tell him how his reaction made her feel, listen to his perspective and try and work this out via mutual respect and appreciation for one another through deeper communication. A counselor would be an excellent support for that endeavor.", "YTA.  Not wanting your husband to attend a baby shower and/or the birth of his own child because he is excited about having a son, which you interpret years-later as him having been insufficiently excited (for your personal taste) about having a daughter is, honestly, one of the most mind-numbingly dumb and asshole-ish things I've ever read in this sub.\n\nNot only are you the asshole, you're the asshole a thousand times over.", "I cried when I found out I was having a girl. I have a shit relationship with my mom and was so scared she wouldn't love me that I wanted a boy. My daughter is the best human I've ever met and I wouldn't trade her for anything but in the moment, I was upset. By the time I had my son, I wanted another girl. Lol. YTA. Just because he's really excited for a boy doesn't mean he has a problem with girls. If he's a good dad and husband then you need to let this go.", "YTA\n\nBy your own acknowledged he wasn't sad or angry about having a girl, he was happy. He was just happier to have a boy.\n\nYou're reading into this way too much.", "YTA you guys already have a daughter so of course he will be more excited about having his first son instead of a second daughter", "No judgment, as I would be disgusted too. But please talk with him after you\u2019ve had a chance to  reflect, and be honest about your feelings rather than doling out \u201cpunishments\u201d. One thing to ask him is what your existing child might be unconsciously internalizing about her worth, based on his reaction to this, and if/how that\u2019s going to play out going forward?", "YTA- excluding would be a relationship ender for me and many others. It doesn\u2019t sound like he treats your daughter badly or complained about having a second girl. So what\u2019s the problem that he got excited for unexpectedly having a boy?!

Nothing wrong with that. He has probably always wanted to have a son, and that\u2019s okay!", "YWBTA. Don\u2019t do it. It will be a sore spot for years, maybe forever, if you do. \n\nTalk it through with him. Explain that you\u2019re worried he\u2019s going to play favorites, you\u2019re worried that his reaction means he\u2019s going to perpetuate sexist norms with your kids, you\u2019re hurt at the thought that he wouldn\u2019t have really loved another daughter, etc. Make him explain to you why he wants a son in particular. Clear the air. \n\nOh and make sure you\u2019re on the same page in regards to loving both your kids equally, regardless of sex, gender, and whether or not they\u2019re LGBTQ. \n\nIf instead you simply punish him for having the wrong feeling, you will achieve nothing other than damage to your relationship.", "While I do think you\u2019ll regret not having him there for these moments later on down the road, I can\u2019t help but question if his favor for a boy will effect his relationship with both of your children. \n\nI would be worried about favoritism with that reaction.

This needs to be shut down fast for the sake of daughter", "YWBTA.\n\nYou're being very immature if you don't let him attend the \"baby shower,\" even worse the birth. I think it's very likely he wanted a boy because you two already have a girl, not because he never wanted a girl in the family all along (it seems to me you may be getting this kind of idea).\n\nYou're making a big deal out of this and your reaction could in fact erode your relationship. Don't grow resentment over something like this.", "Yes, you would be YTA. Especially the birth. Yes he was excited it's a boy but that isn't an excuse to deprive him of a once in a lifetime moment.\n\nI honestly don't know how you would recover from that. The punishment doesn't fit the 'crime'.\n\nI'd just keep an eye on him post birth and make sure he treats the kids equally", "IMFO - Does he treat your daughter right? Is he a good husband and father? Are there any cultural things related to his family?", "I think you have a right to be upset, his difference in reaction is kinda shitty and it might end up developing into favouritism later. At the end of the day, the comfort and needs of person who is having the baby taken out of them overrules everything when it comes to the delivery of said baby. But it's pretty serious to bar someone who would otherwise usually be there, and I feel like you don't have to go to that level just yet. Work through this, because if you're upset enough to not want him in the room when the kid is being born (for a reason that's not 'he faints at the sight of blood and would be a nuisance to the hospital staff', your marriage is already fractured and will probably get worse.", "YTA\n\nWhen my wife and I had our first, and found out it was a boy, my wife was happy but disappointed it wasn\u2019t a girl.  For our second we found out it was a girl and she was ecstatic!  I didn\u2019t get upset or mad at her because her reactions were completely different.  She loves both our kids with all her heart and I\u2019m sure your husband will as well.  You are making a mountain out of a mile hill.  Let him be excited it\u2019s a boy and move on.", "INFO\n\nSo where\u2019s the rest of the story? Pretty extreme reaction I\u2019d say.", "ESH - I understand all the reasons a Dad might be more excited for a son, but as a Mom my heart would ache for my daughter seeing her father react like that and seeing how badly he wanted another boy. I don't think it's right to exclude him from the baby festivities, but I understand why you feel negatively about the situation. There's a difference between having a preference and making the preference so blatantly clear to you and your other children.", "lol I get you\u2019re probably sensitive and hormonal right now, but YTA.", "NAH. I think you\u2019re totally allowed to be upset about the difference in reaction, but I also think he\u2019s allowed to be excited. I do think barring him from the birth would definitely be an extreme reaction though. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d let emotions settle a little and have a talk with him about why you\u2019re upset and maybe he\u2019ll be able to explain why he\u2019s so much more excited. I think this is one of those situations where a good, open conversation will go a long way to getting everyone back on the same page.", "ESH I get your problem with his reaction but your reaction isn\u2019t going to help matters", "ESH i think. that would really turn me off and disgust me too, so i\u2019m not faulting your reaction here. but he is still the father. you chose this man, which means he will be around this child. you can keep him from the birth since that\u2019s your choice, but the shower is fair game.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. His reaction does seem over the top and it would definitely bother me too, BUT it\u2019s super petty and mean to keep him out of the room just for his overreacting. If you have other legit concerns that he will make your birth experience uncomfortable for you, that\u2019s one thing, but if you want to do this out of spite and anger, you should really rethink your stance", "YTA majorly if you punish the father of your child for being excited about having a son. It's not like he was disappointed about the idea of having another daughter. \n\nNot letting him attend the birth would be extremely cruel of you.", "Honestly, it would hurt me too. Many people saying that it's just a gender preference and disappointment and nothing more than that are being very optimistic. \n \nObviously, you know more about him. Do you think your son will be a golden child to the husband and daughter would be sidelined? There are many many daughters who notice the preferential treatment the son gets. It can be very very hurtful. \n\nThe best thing is to discuss your concerns. Your decision while may seem reasonable to you, would not help alleviate the concern you have. Talk. \n\nI would go with NTA.", "YTA. Good luck with your divorce.", "Info: were/are you only planning 2 children and he had dealt with the fact that he wouldn\u2019t have a son? Being overjoyed could be a reaction to that, accepting you won\u2019t get something you want, but then finding out your are.

After we had a girl, I was super happy that our next was a boy. I wanted to have both, and we were having both, and that was super good news. \n\nBut even leaving that aside, your proposed response to what he did is just so unbelievably over the top and cruel that I don't understand how you are even considering it.  I would never, ever forgive somebody who did that to me.", "YTA - you\u2019re going to make the baby\u2019s father miss the birth of his child because you\u2019re mad that he was excited about said baby?

Don\u2019t create drama when there isn\u2019t any.", "YTA, it\u2019s not like he acted disappointed when he found out it was a girl. He was just super excited to be having a boy. Keeping him out of the delivery room is a huge overreaction", "yes, you would be a GIGANTIC AH. He's allowed to be excited for a son. We're all human. I cried when we found out our 3rd was a boy. Then cried again a month later when we found out we were actually having a girl. Feelings are complicated. You're being a jerk. TALK to your partner about your concerns, don't alienate him because you're mad.", "YTA. I get it - the history of boys being prioritized and revered in childbirth is LAME and sexist af. \n\nThe punishment wouldn\u2019t fit the crime.

He\u2019s clearly showing an extremely strong gender preference which could very well lead to blatant favoritism. This will continue to be a problem in the future unless it is discussed and stopped immediately. As for uninviting him from the shower, that\u2019s petty. HOWEVER the birth is YOUR medical procedure.

Just make sure this is what you truly want to do.", "I mean, regardless of whether he is present at the party or birth... that doesnt really fix the main issue, does it?

You would make him miss the birth because he was more excited about having a boy? I can see the future arguments already about favoritism.

People react to different pregnancies in unique ways.\n\nFor my first child we found out the sex and I was excited that I was having a son. For the second we didn't find out, it was a surprise and I was really excited that I was having a girl this time. Not because I wanted a girl more but because a we found out in the delivery room and b because we had one of each so felt our little family was unique.\n\nI also felt an instant bond with my daughter that took a few weeks with my son. I can't explain why, but I think already being a dad I was way more prepared the second time around.\n\nPeople will react to situations differently based on experience.

We knew we\u2019d love the 2nd child as much as the first but still were a bit disappointed *in the moment* when we were told it was another boy.

Hell no. And our 2nd boy is a little badass. So funny and full of personality.

So get over it because YTA.", "YTA - I get why you\u2019re upset and its your choice to not have him at these events but using them as punishment isnt the answer. \n\nI\u2019m sure he loves his daughters and is a good father, but the guy also wanted to have a son.

It's something different! Something new! One of each- that's fun!\n\nYou're WAY overreacting.

It would be different if he had reacted negatively to the news of a daughter. He may have had a preference but he absolutely did not make it know until he found out.

Men imagine the bond they will have with a son, the shared interest the things he can teach them...bonds that they don't automatically imagine that they will have with a daughter because men and women are different. Women imagine the bond and friendship they will have with a daughter especially as adults that they won't necessarily have with a son because men and women are different. The reality is often different but in the moment the fantasy is powerful. My MIL adores us DILs because she always wanted daughters.

There\u2019s also something about having a little mini me that a lot of parents get excited about.\n\nYour reaction is disproportionate to what he did, at the end of the day, you have a man thats excited to be a father and loves the kid you already have.

He\u2019s likely very hurt and confused by your reaction. Let him be excited.", "Oh come on OP. YTA.\n\nOf course he's excited to have a boy! The idea of a mini version of ourselves is part of the joy of having a kid, and it's only natural (or at least culturally inbuilt) to feel especially excited about a child the same sex as ourselves, and all the stuff we imagine we can teach them and show them and do with them.\n\nI mean, the reality of a child's gender may be different to our traditional ideas around physical sex, but that's another conversation. \n\nGive your husband a break. Is this really worth arguing over?", "I can see that his reaction hurt you. Maybe let things cool and discuss that after. If it's really a concern and you plan on having more children, sure it could hurt them in the future if there is favoritism based on gender. Would he have seen your child as less of it was a daughter? That's definitely concerning if so. YTA for barring him from being part of this journey, but I think this could easily be fixed by a conversation surrounding why you were upset and your concerns around that. If the answers of that conversation are alarming, then take it from there. Seems like emotions are running a little high at the moment.", "YWBTA, yeah.

It's not about him being disappointed with a girl; it's about him showing an obvious extreme preference for a boy. Also, I disagree with your assumption about why he's more excited for a boy. I doubt it has anything to do with his father and has much more to do with societal expectations of boys versus girls and what kind of things they'll enjoy, what kind of bond they'll have, maybe even some absurdity about carrying on the family name, etc. It could be a whole host of things, but honestly, it doesn't matter.

If he's been putting up with this attitude of yours for awhile then the spark is probably close to the powder and you may not have much time left to be a family with this man.  It's impossible to know where the red line might be and I can't assure you're not already past it.  It may already be too late but then again, it may not be.  It all depends on how patient he is which I can't know.  I'd like to think there's a shot.\n\nThe big thing that is going to help save you right now is humility.  You can't both save face and save the marriage -- you are going to have to admit that you were absolutely, positively, 100% dead wrong.  If you can't do that?  Well he could be an absolute saint I suppose but I'm not holding my breath", "YTA \n\nwhat\u2019s wrong with his reaction.

By doing this your basically gonna ruin the family and potentially loose a father figure for your children. I know OP feeling might be hurt, but biologically looking in men will always prefer a son and same goes with females wanting daughters. Some people just want the little person of them which is perfectly fine and some don\u2019t care about gender. I think maybe OP is just mad that they won\u2019t have a second daughter and is using the husband as a scapegoat to release all that frustration upon. But I don\u2019t know them.

Let me check this and make sure I\u2019m being conscientious that my daughter and wife are feeling loved and respected as women.\u201d Because I do believe gender preference so extreme as that likely come from either trauma or sexism or both.

But I feel like he\u2019s more than entitled to be stoked at the prospect of having a son too. My parents were very lucky and got 2 of each and we all are very different.

OP YTA", "I honestly think it's a legit case of gender disappointment that she's projecting onto him.", "Are parents not allowed to want a certain gender anymore? It's literally one of the most basic questions prospective parents get asked. I've almost never seen a mother get called sexist for saying they would prefer a boy or a girl.", "Sexist favouritism? \n\nMaybe he's just excited because he can pass his experience o being a guy.\n\nAs an aside, it's odd that ye used the words \"fantasy this guy built up\", seeing is that's exactly what you've done with OP's husband, also purely based on him having a penis.\n\nThe blind hypocrisy is almost impressive, mate. Well done.", "Teaching my kid cooking - although a girl - has clearly instilled a lot healthier attitudes than I remember 90s girls getting over food and portions. She helps pick the meal. There\u2019s always some part of it she likes. We talk out what we do and why. So it\u2019s fun, and she doesn\u2019t hate eating anymore like she did when she was left out. \n\nAlso throwing in different rhetoric about food helped. (Food is fuel. It\u2019s not bad or good. Some foods have more vitamins than others, but treats sometimes are okay, too!) I have a specialized diet and it\u2019s almost become a game on how I can manage the meal where I can eat it but she also likes it. We\u2019ve found 6-7 vegetables in rotation so far. \n\nPrior to the pandemic she helped pick the produce too. But I\u2019m high risk so that stopped.", "\"The reach you're achieving would make Luffy from One Piece jealous.\"\n\nThis absolutely *sent* me.", "google \"gender disappointment\" and it's literally 90% women being upset they're not having a daughter. but god forbid a dad want a son. \n\njesus christ people", "Applause to your sis for changing her last name \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4c", "I almost posted that, like I wanted a brother just because I had a sister and I wanted both, but part of me wonders what dad would have done then and the other part of me is like \"give the man some credit\" lol.  And not a saint over here either but who is?", "Yeah, that's how I may not be able to articulate it, but they can certainly notice. People view children as being less observant as they actually are, because children aren't able to articulate themselves as well as an adult can.", "Mental gymnastics ?  You should do some cuz youre cooked.", "Thank you, I specialize in bringing up One Piece in every conversation I'm in \ud83e\udd23", "This! Gender disappointment is an actual thing. It doesn't stay forever and most times grows into acceptance. With my first I told myself I wanted a boy. I tried to convince myself that's what I wanted but when I found out she was a girl I was ecstatic. Even more so when I found out my 2nd was a boy. I recently got married and my husband has always wanted a girl, and now this girl is almost done baking.\n\nPeople are allowed to feel disappointment when they don't get the gender they hoped for, but can still have appreciation for having a healthy baby. We don't know if this happiness was actually because he favored boys, because he doesn't want to be the only male, or (what I see most commonly) because he wants a daughter AND a son, and now he gets to have both.\n\nPeople are jumping to conclusions waaaaay to quickly here.", "Thank you! This bothered me SO MUCH.\n\nThis guy was told he was having a second daughter. He was then told \"just kidding it's a boy\". OF COURSE he's gonna be over the top excited about it, let's be honest the chances of having more than two kids isn't very high, he probably told himself he'd never get to have a son.\n\nNo misogyny required to be excited about having one kid of each gender. And there is NO EVIDENCE in this post that he will \"treat the son better\" or \"not love the son if he comes out as lgbtq+\" jfc people get a grip.", "I Googled it and my results don't fit with your statement. We could compare?", "What I'm saying is his \"overreaction\" might be because it's twofold; a boy and that means they have one of each. \n\nIt's not necessarily malicious. \n\nYou're saying \"in reality\" as if you have more of an insight to this particular situation than the rest of us. You don't. You're just more comfortable with assuming sexism than I am.\n\nSexism is a huge issue, but it's not every issue. A man being excited to have a son doesn't mean he won't love his daughter less anymore than a woman being excited to have a daughter doesn't mean she doesn't love her son.\n\nPeople can be excited for experiences without it being a red flag to a life long battle. Having a son is a new experience, it's also a new spin on an experience he's currently having. \n\nI think OP (though her right to do so) banning her husband from the birth of his son could also set up a dynamic in which the husband coverts time with his son because of the missed experience/s (I'm dubious this distance will end after birth). Thus creating the \"he likes his son more\" situation that OP apparently fears.\n\nWait until there is a comparable relationship and parenting track record before jumping to massive conclusions.", "I don\u2019t think it necessarily has to be sexism. I know a woman who tried to have a daughter 3 times. The final attempt was twin boys. She stopped trying after that.", "I\u2019ve never known a man **so** into shaving that he\u2019d lose his shit with excitement over getting to share that with someone.  sports, sure. but shaving? come on lol", "His daughter might learn she's (he's) a trans man, and he can help shave that face too!\n\nOr maybe his son learns he's (she's) a trans woman, in which case he probably won't be helping any of his kids shave.\n\nThis might be an extreme scenario, but my point is that each little human being is going to be their own little human being, and having expectations for them based on their sex organs probably isn't going to work out very well for them. At least, not in the best way.\n\nMy father wanted several sons, and got two daughters instead. He never taught us to shave, but he DID play catch with us, take us hunting and fishing and backcountry camping, and teach us to use all the tools in his workshop. The only difference between having daughters vs sons for him was... absolutely nothing."]}
