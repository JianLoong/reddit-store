Maybe this has been a lifelong dream of his, to have a son. \n\nNow obviously the hope is that he does not play favorites, but until the kids get to that age, you're not going to know if he will do that or not. \n\nIf you ban him from his own child's birth, YTA\n\nAlso: If I've learned anything from the amount of couple's therapy I've gone through with my own wife, it's that any kind of withholding techniques used as punishment toward a partner (i.e. not talking, withholding affection, not allowing into space, etc.) only *ever* makes your partner resent you that much more.\n\n Is that really how you want your son's life to start?", "YTA.  Not wanting your husband to attend a baby shower and/or the birth of his own child because he is excited about having a son, which you interpret years-later as him having been insufficiently excited (for your personal taste) about having a daughter is, honestly, one of the most mind-numbingly dumb and asshole-ish things I've ever read in this sub.\n\nNot only are you the asshole, you're the asshole a thousand times over.", "I cried when I found out I was having a girl. I have a shit relationship with my mom and was so scared she wouldn't love me that I wanted a boy. My daughter is the best human I've ever met and I wouldn't trade her for anything but in the moment, I was upset. By the time I had my son, I wanted another girl. Lol. YTA. Just because he's really excited for a boy doesn't mean he has a problem with girls. If he's a good dad and husband then you need to let this go.", "YTA\n\nBy your own acknowledged he wasn't sad or angry about having a girl, he was happy. He was just happier to have a boy.\n\nYou're reading into this way too much.", "YTA you guys already have a daughter so of course he will be more excited about having his first son instead of a second daughter", "No judgment, as I would be disgusted too. But please talk with him after you\u2019ve had a chance to  reflect, and be honest about your feelings rather than doling out \u201cpunishments\u201d. One thing to ask him is what your existing child might be unconsciously internalizing about her worth, based on his reaction to this, and if/how that\u2019s going to play out going forward?", "YTA- excluding would be a relationship ender for me and many others. It doesn\u2019t sound like he treats your daughter badly or complained about having a second girl. So what\u2019s the problem that he got excited for unexpectedly having a boy?! I know women who had similar reactions to having a girl doesn\u2019t mean they love their sons any less", "Is this the hill you want your marriage to die on?", "YTA\n\nHe was never upset about having a girl, he is just excited to have a boy. Nothing wrong with that. He has probably always wanted to have a son, and that\u2019s okay!", "YWBTA. Don\u2019t do it. It will be a sore spot for years, maybe forever, if you do. \n\nTalk it through with him. Explain that you\u2019re worried he\u2019s going to play favorites, you\u2019re worried that his reaction means he\u2019s going to perpetuate sexist norms with your kids, you\u2019re hurt at the thought that he wouldn\u2019t have really loved another daughter, etc. Make him explain to you why he wants a son in particular. Clear the air. \n\nOh and make sure you\u2019re on the same page in regards to loving both your kids equally, regardless of sex, gender, and whether or not they\u2019re LBGTQ. \n\nIf instead you simply punish him for having the wrong feeling, you will achieve nothing other than damage to your relationship.", "While I do think you\u2019ll regret not having him there for these moments later on down the road, I can\u2019t help but question if his favor for a boy will effect his relationship with both of your children. \n\nI would be worried about favoritism with that reaction. ESH.", "ESH. It's his kid and he should be present at the birth and baby shower. BUT he is already showing signs of favouritism. This needs to be shut down fast for the sake of daughter", "YWBTA.\n\nYou're being very immature if you don't let him attend the \"baby shower,\" even worse the birth. I think it's very likely he wanted a boy because you two already have a girl, not because he never wanted a girl in the family all along (it seems to me you may be getting this kind of idea).\n\nYou're making a big deal out of this and your reaction could in fact erode your relationship. Don't grow resentment over something like this.", "Yes, you would be YTA. Especially the birth. Yes he was excited it's a boy but that isn't an excuse to deprive him of a once in a lifetime moment.\n\nI honestly don't know how you would recover from that. The punishment doesn't fit the 'crime'.\n\nI'd just keep an eye on him post birth and make sure he treats the kids equally", "IMFO - Does he treat your daughter right? Is he a good husband and father? Are there any cultural things related to his family?", "I think you have a right to be upset, his difference in reaction is kinda shitty and it might end up developing into favouritism later. At the end of the day, the comfort and needs of person who is having the baby taken out of them overrules everything when it comes to the delivery of said baby. But it's pretty serious to bar someone who would otherwise usually be there, and I feel like you don't have to go to that level just yet. Work through this, because if you're upset enough to not want him in the room when the kid is being born (for a reason that's not 'he faints at the sight of blood and would be a nuisance to the hospital staff', your marriage is already fractured and will probably get worse.", "YTA\n\nWhen my wife and I had our first, and found out it was a boy, my wife was happy but disappointed it wasn\u2019t a girl.  For our second we found out it was a girl and she was ecstatic!  I didn\u2019t get upset or mad at her because her reactions were completely different.  She loves both our kids with all her heart and I\u2019m sure your husband will as well.  You are making a mountain out of a mile hill.  Let him be excited it\u2019s a boy and move on.", "INFO\n\nSo where\u2019s the rest of the story? Pretty extreme reaction I\u2019d say.", "ESH - I understand all the reasons a Dad might be more excited for a son, but as a Mom my heart would ache for my daughter seeing her father react like that and seeing how badly he wanted another boy. I don't think it's right to exclude him from the baby festivities, but I understand why you feel negatively about the situation. There's a difference between having a preference and making the preference so blatantly clear to you and your other children.", "lol I get you\u2019re probably sensitive and hormonal right now, but YTA.", "NAH. I think you\u2019re totally allowed to be upset about the difference in reaction, but I also think he\u2019s allowed to be excited. I do think barring him from the birth would definitely be an extreme reaction though. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d let emotions settle a little and have a talk with him about why you\u2019re upset and maybe he\u2019ll be able to explain why he\u2019s so much more excited. I think this is one of those situations where a good, open conversation will go a long way to getting everyone back on the same page.", "ESH I get your problem with his reaction but your reaction isn\u2019t going to help matters", "ESH i think. that would really turn me off and disgust me too, so i\u2019m not faulting your reaction here. but he is still the father. you chose this man, which means he will be around this child. you can keep him from the birth since that\u2019s your choice, but the shower is fair game.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. His reaction does seem over the top and it would definitely bother me too, BUT it\u2019s super petty and mean to keep him out of the room just for his overreacting. If you have other legit concerns that he will make your birth experience uncomfortable for you, that\u2019s one thing, but if you want to do this out of spite and anger, you should really rethink your stance", "YTA majorly if you punish the father of your child for being excited about having a son. It's not like he was disappointed about the idea of having another daughter. \n\nNot letting him attend the birth would be extremely cruel of you.", "Honestly, it would hurt me too. Many people saying that it's just a gender preference and disappointment and nothing more than that are being very optimistic. \n \nObviously, you know more about him. Do you think your son will be a golden child to the husband and daughter would be sidelined? There are many many daughters who notice the preferential treatment the son gets. It can be very very hurtful. \n\nThe best thing is to discuss your concerns. Your decision while may seem reasonable to you, would not help alleviate the concern you have. Talk. \n\nI would go with NTA.", "YTA. Good luck with your divorce.", "Info: were/are you only planning 2 children and he had dealt with the fact that he wouldn\u2019t have a son? Being overjoyed could be a reaction to that, accepting you won\u2019t get something you want, but then finding out your are. As someone else mentioned lots  of men want sons/lots of women want daughters, that\u2019s a daily normal feeling about parenthood. As long as he is a good dad to your daughter YWBTA if you excluded him from the birth.", "YTA.\n\nI guess I get where you\u2019re coming from but this is an extreme reaction. He wanted a boy but was happy with having a girl and lo and behold, he\u2019s getting a boy. Unless he treats your daughter as lesser than or talks about being relieved that it\u2019s a boy, there\u2019s no reason to be mad at him.", "YWBTA\n\nWhen we had our first kid, I didn't care about the gender.  After we had a girl, I was super happy that our next was a boy. I wanted to have both, and we were having both, and that was super good news. \n\nBut even leaving that aside, your proposed response to what he did is just so unbelievably over the top and cruel that I don't understand how you are even considering it.  I would never, ever forgive somebody who did that to me.", "YTA - you\u2019re going to make the baby\u2019s father miss the birth of his child because you\u2019re mad that he was excited about said baby? WTF? Gender disappointment is a real phenomenon and it sounds like your husband has handled it really well. Don\u2019t create drama when there isn\u2019t any.", "YTA, it\u2019s not like he acted disappointed when he found out it was a girl. He was just super excited to be having a boy. Keeping him out of the delivery room is a huge overreaction", "yes, you would be a GIGANTIC AH. He's allowed to be excited for a son. We're all human. I cried when we found out our 3rd was a boy. Then cried again a month later when we found out we were actually having a girl. Feelings are complicated. You're being a jerk. TALK to your partner about your concerns, don't alienate him because you're mad.", "YTA. I get it - the history of boys being prioritized and revered in childbirth is LAME and sexist af. \n\nThe punishment wouldn\u2019t fit the crime. It would make more sense to just COMMUNICATE with him and ask why he is so much more excited, and share why that reaction disturbed you, so you can both understand more and grow.", "ESH. He\u2019s clearly showing an extremely strong gender preference which could very well lead to blatant favoritism. This will continue to be a problem in the future unless it is discussed and stopped immediately. As for uninviting him from the shower, that\u2019s petty. HOWEVER the birth is YOUR medical procedure. You are allowed to have (or not have) whoever you want there. If it\u2019s not liked, so sad too bad. Just make sure this is what you truly want to do.", "I mean, regardless of whether he is present at the party or birth... that doesnt really fix the main issue, does it? Just grows the animosity?", "YTA. He's happy. Seems like he loves his daughter too. Stop punishing him for heing happy.\n\nBut... talk to him about your real concern. Favourtism. And how you will work together as parents to ensure equal treatment regardless of gender. TOGETHER.", "YTA. I was just pregnant and had our first kid and we both def had a \u201cI hope we have\u201d and regardless we are going to be happy. Most people get excited if they get to have what they always wanted it doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t love his daughter just as much.", "yta according to you he loves his daughter and would have been happy if the baby had been a girl\u2026 you didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with him being happy about a girl but are upset about him being happy about a boy.. did he go overboard with the celebration maybe.. but admit it or not most people do wish for one or the other doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t love and cherish the child they get but doesn\u2019t mean a man doesn\u2019t want a boy or a woman doesn\u2019t want a girl or vice versa. be glad you have a husband who is involved and supportive and not a dead beat.", "Yta get tf over yourself. He\u2019s allowed to hope for a son, especially given he already got a daughter. Also when he thought he got another girl he was still happy even if he hoped for a boy.\n\nNot allowing him to be at the birth of his son because you got offended on behalf of a baby will have you coparenting within 5 years.", "Yes, YTA. You would make him miss the birth because he was more excited about having a boy? I can see the future arguments already about favoritism. If I had a son & my man thought we'd be having another one but it turns out we didn't & he was more excited to have a girl, I wouldn't mind or be upset. Pick your battles.", "YTA\n\nHe wanted a boy and you\u2019re upset about it? He was happy when he thought it was a girl as well \n\nBe petty if you want, but don\u2019t come whining when the marriage falls apart", "YTA for a couple of reasons. People react to different pregnancies in unique ways.\n\nFor my first child we found out the sex and I was excited that I was having a son. For the second we didn't find out, it was a surprise and I was really excited that I was having a girl this time. Not because I wanted a girl more but because a we found out in the delivery room and b because we had one of each so felt our little family was unique.\n\nI also felt an instant bond with my daughter that took a few weeks with my son. I can't explain why, but I think already being a dad I was way more prepared the second time around.\n\nPeople will react to situations differently based on experience. If you had had a son first he may have been more excited second time around because he was having a girl. If you exclude him from this event you will be the asshole 100%.", "YTA 100% - \u201cNot attend the birth?\u201d You can\u2019t be serious. It\u2019s a very childish and AH way of thinking. It\u2019s something he didn\u2019t see coming, which compounds the excitement. \n\nWe love our two boys (2 & 7) to death, but we wanted a girl second time around. We knew we\u2019d love the 2nd child as much as the first but still were a bit disappointed *in the moment* when we were told it was another boy. Now, can you imagine if we went through that emotion and then find out we were told wrong and SURPRISE! ITS A GIRL! We\u2019d be so excited! \n\nDoes that mean we would have loved a girl more? Hell no. And our 2nd boy is a little badass. So funny and full of personality. Can\u2019t imagine having any other child. \n\nEmotions in the moment don\u2019t always depict how things will go in the future. So get over it because YTA.", "YTA - I get why you\u2019re upset and its your choice to not have him at these events but using them as punishment isnt the answer. \n\nI\u2019m sure he loves his daughters and is a good father, but the guy also wanted to have a son. After having two girls, I get that. That doesn\u2019t make him love his daughters any less.", "ESH\n\nHis reaction is ridiculous and I would worry about his relashionship with his daughter. \n\nBut yours is also overblown.", "YWBTA. \n\nI'm a girls girl through and through. \n\nI would be happy with 0 sons, but when we found out this baby's sex, I still got unexpectedly excited for a son. It's something different! Something new! One of each- that's fun!\n\nYou're WAY overreacting. Especially since he was happy to have a girl before he knew it was a boy. \n\nGender disappointment is real and much discussed on the baby subreddits. You didn't even experience that. File this as a net positive and please don't shut out your husband for something so ridiculous.", "YTA, people are allowed to be excited about things.. He didn't act disappointed or unhappy when he thought he was having a girl, he was happy either way- he's just extra excited that he'll have a boy to do father/son things with, a mini him maybe. It doesn't mean he doesn't love his daughter. This isn't something worth punishing him for, you're being over emotional.", "YWBTA. It would be different if he had reacted negatively to the news of a daughter. He may have had a preference but he absolutely did not make it know until he found out. Preventing him from being at the birth of his own child? That's petty. And IMO that sort of pettiness doesn't stop there. Share his joy OP, every man secretly wants a little buddy.", "Mehhh I understand where you are coming from, but I think YTA. \n\nBarring your husband from the delivery room is something you can\u2019t undo and won\u2019t be easily forgiven. It will cause irreparable long term harm to your marriage. Sit down and talk about it. I would guess your fear is more that your son will be heavily favored by his father - sit down and talk about that.", "Keeping him from the birth is way too extreme jfc. YTA.", "You\u2019re being extremely childish. YTA", "I\u2019m going against the grain here with ESH. Your husband sucks because he clearly didn\u2019t want another girl and was ecstatic about the boy news. He could\u2019t even contain himself and showed that having another daughter would have been a less desired outcome. But you cannot behave this way either. Barring him from the birth of your son is not a good idea. You two need to be good parents for both your children. Have a good conversation about his sexism and how you feel about it, and hopefully you\u2019ll come out stronger because of it.", "You are under no obligation to have anyone in the room at the birth you don't want there. As the person pushing a baby out of your nether regions your wishes come first. You are the one risking your life and health and you are the one who is vulnerable you get what you want and what makes you comfortable.\n\nHOWEVER..is this about your comfort and feeling safe or anger and spite......do you really want to potentially blow your marriage up over an over enthusastic reaction.. Would some sessions of couples therapy might not be a first stop.....before you start a domestic war of tit for tat...and do things out of spite or revenge you can't take back and might be very difficult for him to forgive and you might regret later. \n\nIt is not actually that unusual for parents to be excited about a mini me. Men imagine the bond they will have with a son, the shared interest the things he can teach them...bonds that they don't automatically imagine that they will have with a daughter because men and women are different. Women imagine the bond and friendship they will have with a daughter especially as adults that they won't necessarily have with a son because men and women are different. The reality is often different but in the moment the fantasy is powerful. My MIL adores us DILs because she always wanted daughters. She loves her sons and gets on great with them but woman to woman friendships often have a different dynamic than man to women ones. He should have been more tactful but he is entitled to his feelings. You don't get to tell people how to feel.  \n\nSo yes YWBATA ot yourself to your child and to your marriage and husband if you do this just to punish your husband for being over excited it was a boy and not actually working to resolve this rather than escalate it.", "YTA already using your child as a pawn before he's even born", "ESH.  \n\n\nHe is definitely a dumbass for not having enough sense to realize that he was letting his bias show, and at the level of his reaction, I would be concerned about how capable he was of treating the kids equally. That's an issue worth discussing.  \n\n\nBut I also know that my better half and I really, really, really hoped for a boy for our first child and equally hoped to have a girl for our second. We didn't try for a baby either time until we were emotionally in a place to be happy and grateful for either, but...NGL, we WERE thrilled to \"win\" the coin toss twice.   \n\n\nAnd because you went nuclear right out of the gate, you kinda killed your chance to have the discussion with him. Suggest you two make a couple therapy appointments and talk out your (reasonable) fears.", "I\u2019m going to say this with kid gloves because you\u2019re pregnant and being pregnant is rough: YWBTA. Ask yourself if it\u2019s really worth it to start this much drama because your husband is excited to have a son. Is he a good father? If so- don\u2019t let this bother you. If you\u2019re being this divisive before your son is even born, then you\u2019ll be setting yourself up to compare and contrast every aspect of how he parents both children. Not worth it, friend.", "Ywbta\n\nThat's a bell you can't unring, esp  not allowing him at the birth. That's too extreme & punishing him in that way will drive a huge wedge in your marriage imo. Do you have the right to be hurt or mad? Sure. But go to couples counseling & work on your issues. Don't do something you can't take back", "YTA\n\nDude is excited. He was happy when he thought it was a girl.\n\nSounds like you should be thankful you have a good man and your kids have a good father.", "ESH\n\nHe should not have shown this disparity of reaction to your daughter. She's young, but she's still old enough to pick up on biases.\n\nYou need to decide how you wanna move forward with this relationship. Yeah his difference in reaction was shitty, but do you want to tank the entire relationship & marriage as a result? Because excluding him from the birth is the kind of thing that creates a permanent rift in a relationship - you don't get to take that back or walk back from it. Drawing these boundaries then expecting the relationship to just function normally isn't reasonable.", "YWBTA. Based on the info provided, it sounds like he just got really excited for a boy, which I don\u2019t think is out of line. Your reaction seems a little extreme for what you told us.", "Doing this wouldn't be the right way to handle it but I don't think you're completely TA. If you have concerns about him potentially treating the kids different or favouring the son then handle it with communication instead of petty revenge.", "YTA. That's... So immature. You both probably should go to therapy.", "Info: has he started treating your daughter differently now that there is a boy on the way?", "YTA\n\nHe would be tha AH if he doesn't treat his kids equally, but for now, you are the one stealing from him unique experiences, specialy the birth of a kid because \"you don't like that he wanted a boy more than a girl\".", "YTA. I want boys, but there\u2019s no chance in hell my daughter is ever going to miss out. My dad always wanted boys, he got 3 girls. I never felt like he loved me less because I was a girl. Not the hill to die on and a huge overreaction from you that could probably cause problems down the line as well. Just let him be excited", "YTA. That's a pretty standard reaction for a father tbh. Whether it's a boy or a girl shouldn't matter. Hell he celebrated by picking up HIS DAUGHTER. Not like he went to a bar with the boys to celebrate the news. \n\nYou're gonna punish him for his joyful outburst by forbidding him from attending the baby shower? Are you gonna keep him from the hospital room when you bring your son into this world? I wonder what your family and in-laws think about your premature outburst.", "YTA. Grow up and stop the pettiness. Your husband is excited to have a son, your petty desire for revenge, will guarantee turn around to bite you in the heinie. I'm trying to imagine you telling family and friends that husband was denied coming to a shower or the delivery because he was excited about having a son.", "YTA\n\nI understand why you're upset since you already have a daughter and hope he would be just as excited for either gender, but this is an extreme reaction. Communicate with him and don't let this end the relationship if everything else is good.", "YTA. Can you imagine your son asking why his dad wasn't in the room for his birth? Because he was excited about having a son.  Yeah that is what makes you an ass.", "ESH. Most of us have a slight preference but really the only thing that should matter is the baby is healthy and well whatever gender. His reaction is so overblown, at least in how your described it, that I get your irritation. On the other hand, not allowing him to the shower or birth is just vindictive. not constructive dealing with the issue. You should sit down and talk about it, express your concerns and hear him out, and ensure that there will be no preferential treatment or prioritising one child over the other.", "YWBTA, being more excited to have a boy when it came as an unexpected surprise and you already have a girl does not mean he will not love them both the same. \n\nNothing wrong happened but you want to ban him from the baby shower for a pretty much normal reaction.\n\nYou have couples where the husband is not happy and here you're being upset while your guy is happy and excited regardless.", "Gently, YTA\n\ngender excitement and gender disappointment is normal and real for expecting parents.\n\nI had a daughter first and was thrilled!!  So was my husband.  Second was our son and while i had never cared prior and always wanted a little boy when they told me, i freaked out. What did i know about little boys?!? I was momentarily scared and confused. Meanwhile my husband was over the moon.\n\nYou are hormonal, you are growing a human, you are sensitive and i understand. But this isn't a slight against you and the daughter you already have.", "Would you feel the same way if the genders of the children were reversed? If you already had a 3yo boy and then he was this thrilled for a girl, would you still be mad at his enthusiasm?\n\nYWBTA. You can be annoyed, but it sounds like he was going to love the new baby, no matter the gender..", "YWBTA\n\nIt's okay for him to be excited about having a boy. It doesn't mean he loves his daughters any less. You're being irrational about the whole situation. Keeping him from the birth would be an awful thing to do to him.", "This might be an unpopular opinion but YTA! I know a few couples who were ecstatic to have one boy and one girl because they preferred to have one of each gender.\n\nThere are a lot of people who have a preference but that in no way means that they love their child any less.\nI think you are completely overreacting to this and being totally irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why people get shit just because they have a gender preference.

Is this traditionally a female only gathering where you are? If so, then I wonder why he was planning to attend at all and NTA.

Talking it out is much better than going nuclear, however", "ESH\u2026 i think you guys need to talk and have a serious conversation about this. gender disappointment is normal for parents, but it has to be managed appropriately. i don\u2019t think he\u2019s the AH necessarily for his reaction, a lot of men react that way, BUT if he crosses into favoring your son over your daughter, or rejecting your daughter in favor of your son, that\u2019s another story entirely. excluding him from the birth of this child and the celebrations you\u2019re having for said baby is what makes you the ah; i get how you feel but this was the wrong response. communication is key, op. good luck", "NTA.

A lot of men want a son to follow in their footsteps, and a lot of men become emotionally abusive or unkind to their sons when that doesn\u2019t pan out how they expected. Imposing strict gender roles is a Bad Idea all around, and this could end badly. \n\nAs far as the birth itself, I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s really the issue so much as what you plan to do once the child is born.

But that's where you talk about and give him the chance to do better.", "YTA. I honestly fail to see what he did wrong. He was happy? Is that your deal? You are angry because he wanted a boy? And was happy when you two found out it is going to be a boy?", "YTA. I think the overexcitement comes mostly from the part where you 2 get \"one of each\". Allow the man to be happy. If he treats your kids differently, it will be time to take issue with it, but as it stands, you are being unfair and mean.", "YWBTA if you didn\u2019t allow him for being excited. Absolutely.

Would you have preferred he be upset about a boy and act disappointed at the update? Because that makes zero sense. \n\nApologize to your husband. He\u2019s likely very hurt and confused by your reaction. Let him be excited.", "Oh come on OP. YTA.\n\nOf course he's excited to have a boy! The idea of a mini version of ourselves is part of the joy of having a kid, and it's only natural (or at least culturally inbuilt) to feel especially excited about a child the same sex as ourselves, and all the stuff we imagine we can teach them and show them and do with them.\n\nI mean, the reality of a child's gender may be different to our traditional ideas around physical sex, but that's another conversation. \n\nGive your husband a break. Is this really worth arguing over?", "I can see that his reaction hurt you. Maybe let things cool and discuss that after. If it's really a concern and you plan on having more children, sure it could hurt them in the future if there is favoritism based on gender. Would he have seen your child as less of it was a daughter? That's definitely concerning if so. YTA for barring him from being part of this journey, but I think this could easily be fixed by a conversation surrounding why you were upset and your concerns around that. If the answers of that conversation are alarming, then take it from there. Seems like emotions are running a little high at the moment.", "YWBTA, yeah.

She's afraid she'll see her husband suddenly start doing fun things with the son he never did with their daughter. And if that happens, it's already too late to protect the daughter from that emotional damage.", "She was referencing both his reaction to the 3 year olds gender AND his reaction to the very recent misread of the ultrasound, but keep playing mental gymnastics to pretend his obvious favoritism for the boy that\u2019s not even born yet is somehow _just fine_", "Yes, I edited my comment to add that. But OP is not an asshole for being upset about this in general.", "Idk I would rethink my relationship and coparenting with somebody who really wants a boy and will tolerate a girl. I'd get it if he said \"OK, tbh, I'm even more excited now because then we'll have one of each\", but his reaction sounds SO over the top that I'd worry if that's the same person I fell in love with and that person now has to parent his two unequally wanted children. At least the birth should be an event where she gets to pick who's there rather than him having any \"rights\".", "> It doesn't justify banning him from the baby shower", "This isn\u2019t favouritism yet. I wouldn\u2019t jump the gun here. As a guy, I\u2019d be happy to have either child, but getting to raise a mini me is a very exciting prospect indeed! Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d love me already born daughter any less.", "Agreed. She just is for the actions she's taking based off her upset feelings.", "Good thing that\u2019s not the question OP asked then.", "There's no evidence in this post that he would just 'tolerate' his daughter, or treat her as any less loved than his son.\n\nYes, the birth should be and is an event that the person giving birth should be able to pick and choose who she wants there. But that doesn't mean we can't call her an asshole for the reason why she doesn't want someone there.", "No it doesn\u2019t. And the more I think about it, I don\u2019t see the justification in being hurt. \n\nI\u2019ll never judge a woman for being sensitive, particularly a pregnant one, but as I\u2019ve said elsewhere, OP said he is an attentive expectant father and partner and was excited for another daughter. Being EVEN MORE excited for a son for whatever combination of reasons that probably stem from either having or not having a good relationship ship with his own father is not the same thing as being disappointed he was having a daughter.", "Good thing I didn't reply to OP and instead explicitly replied to a comment then.", "> Being EVEN MORE excited for a son for whatever combination of reasons that probably stem from either having or not having a good relationship ship with his own father is not the same thing as being disappointed he was having a daughter.\n\nDisappointment is not the only thing that can hurt someone. It's not about him being disappointed with a girl; it's about him showing an obvious extreme preference for a boy. Also, I disagree with your assumption about why he's more excited for a boy. I doubt it has anything to do with his father and has much more to do with societal expectations of boys versus girls and what kind of things they'll enjoy, what kind of bond they'll have, maybe even some absurdity about carrying on the family name, etc. It could be a whole host of things, but honestly, it doesn't matter. Any partner showing such an intense preference for one sex over the other can be hurtful. It can also leave the other partner wondering: is there going to be favoritism now? Is my daughter going to feel equally loved when her brother is here? Those are valid concerns."]}
