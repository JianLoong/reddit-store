Prior to meeting Mark, I was in a casual relationship with John & developed a bond with his senior dog, Luna. Though I stopped seeing John more than a month before meeting Mark, I still dogsit for Luna if I'm available when John goes out of town. Luna can be boarded, but it's very stressful for her bc she doesn't get along with other dogs, and I enjoy spending time with her, it's good easy money, and John appreciates it. John doesn't have a couch or guest bed so I sleep in his bed when I dogsit. John and I don't see or talk to each other except about Luna.\nBecause I had a casual relationship with John, Mark is upset that I continue to watch Luna now that he and I are dating. I am currently dogsitting her for a week and a half, and this is the second time I've watched her since we started dating. He feels disrespected bc I won't leave Luna alone overnight to stay with him and bc I sleep in John's bed. I can't bring Luna to his house bc he has a dog.\nI'm having a hard time understanding why he feels so angry and hurt that I won't stop watching Luna, and I view it more as jealousy and ego that he needs to deal with.

I get some people don\u2019t see it negatively but not many people are ok with their significant other spending any time with an ex, let alone staying at their house and sleeping in their bed.", "INFO: would you rather spend time with the dog or with Mark? How often is this happening?\n\nYou don't mention anything about your feelings for Mark, how serious you two are, how much time you spend together. That comes across as your feelings and relationship not being serious. Which is fine, though it seems like Mark feels more serious.\n\nIf I was in a new relationship like this, and my partner frequently chose to dogsit over me, it would probably be time to have a conversation about your relationship being more casual than he thinks.", "Can you bring the dog over to your house and watch it there? I feel like that seems like a reasonable compromise, but since you haven\u2019t done that yet I\u2019m guessing maybe there\u2019s a reason why you can\u2019t? \n\nMaybe consider still dog sitting, but not staying there overnight. The dog will probably be fine if you go home for 8 hours to sleep.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t blame your boyfriend for not liking you sleeping in your ex\u2019s bed. It seems weird.

And when we watch our furry vaccation guests, the owner bring them over to ours - we have only once be asked to petsit / feed cats in their own home - bc we had sick pets (cancer) back then and didn't want to add the stress and we only had to feed the other cats twice a day and it was 10mins away by foot, so no big effort.", "YTA\n\n>  I'm having a hard time understanding why he feels so angry and hurt that I won't stop watching Luna\n\n...\n\n> John doesn't have a couch or guest bed so I sleep in his bed\n\nSo you sleep in your ex's bed where you've shared intimate moments and you don't understand?", "Can the dog not come to your house?", "This is going to sound wild but it really ain't that deep.

You can do your relationships how you want, but I will tell you I can\u2019t imagine any self respecting man continuing this relationship, nor could I imagine a self-respecting woman doing so it the genders were reversed. \n\nI think it you had a good friend or sibling in Mark\u2019s situation, even you would be hard pressed to tell them that they should stay.", "NTA \n\nYour bfs insecurities are not on you", "YTA \n\nThere's being helpful then there's sleeping in your exes bed that I'm sure you had plenty other times in.

As others have suggested, try imagining it reversed. If he did these things to you. If the relationship was so casual, who is to say it won't spark up again? Or if the relationship was just casual, why do you have such a strong commitment to the dog?

Are there other things he might find \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to him?

Mark, as well as everyone in the comments saying you are the asshole, absolutely need to learn how to address and manage their feelings of jealousy. \n\nYou are allowed to have a connection with Luna, and if mark can't handle that how do you think he'll feel if you get your own dog when you love? Or a child? Is he going to be jealous of them too? \n\nAs far as sleeping in your Ex's bed, it's a housesitting gig, not like you are still sleeping with the guy.
