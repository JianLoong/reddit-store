Prior to meeting Mark, I was in a casual relationship with John & developed a bond with his senior dog, Luna. Though I stopped seeing John more than a month before meeting Mark, I still dogsit for Luna if I'm available when John goes out of town. Luna can be boarded, but it's very stressful for her bc she doesn't get along with other dogs, and I enjoy spending time with her, it's good easy money, and John appreciates it. John doesn't have a couch or guest bed so I sleep in his bed when I dogsit. John and I don't see or talk to each other except about Luna.\nBecause I had a casual relationship with John, Mark is upset that I continue to watch Luna now that he and I are dating. I am currently dogsitting her for a week and a half, and this is the second time I've watched her since we started dating. He feels disrespected bc I won't leave Luna alone overnight to stay with him and bc I sleep in John's bed. I can't bring Luna to his house bc he has a dog.\nI'm having a hard time understanding why he feels so angry and hurt that I won't stop watching Luna, and I view it more as jealousy and ego that he needs to deal with.

If you go to a hotel and end up in a room where your ex was the last person to sleep there, are you indirectly cheating because they slept in that bed before you?

If you guys can't work through something so small though, you might not be compatible.\n\nEdited to clarify; he can feel how he wants about his girlfriend sleeping in her casual hook up dude's bed. People might have different tolerance levels for that. At 5 months in, I wouldn't be there, personally", "NTA. If your ex isn\u2019t there, why does it matter that you\u2019re sleeping in his bed? He doesn\u2019t have a couch. The only explanations for his actions are 1. jealousy and 2. distrust. In both cases, it\u2019s kind of unfair to you because there\u2019s literally nothing going on except you taking care of a dog. It\u2019s a dog. A poor old dog that you already care about. There\u2019s not much difference between that and dog sitting for a stranger, because the dog is the only thing that matters. Also, you guys have only been together for five months, this is clearly something that is important to you, and this has only occurred twice in the time you\u2019ve been together. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be taking care of the dog forever, either. So he might just need to get over himself? Have a little sympathy for the poor ol dog? Idk, trust you not to cheat on him with your ex that is out of town?", "Yes, YTA. The problem here is you broke up with your ex but not his dog. I get it, dogs are wonderful animals. But Luna belongs to your ex and is his responsibility. She is not a child, and not yours. \n\nYour boyfriend is seeing what you\u2019re not. Your ex can use his dog as a way to keep the door open for potential future something with you. Especially knowing you sleep in his bed. That\u2019s just weird. You have a boyfriend, whether the guy is there or not you should not be sleeping in your ex\u2019s bed.\n\nIf you want to be with Mark, then stop being available to your ex. Get your own dog to love. If you can\u2019t find it in yourself to do that, then you need to seriously question why. It should not be this hard to respect your partner and his concerns. Either you aren\u2019t over your ex, or you\u2019re not really into this new relationship.", "NAH, you're fine to watch the dog. Your \"relationship\" with your ex is completely platonic (if even that much) and solely about a dog you care for. Mark is also within his rights to feel a type of way about you keeping in contact with an ex and establishing his boundaries.", "NTA and people griping about you sleeping in your ex's bed better be buying a new bed everytime they break up with someone or have a one night stand by their own logic. The ex is not there when you are there what is there to be jealous of? For me personally it's a green flag when a partner can get along well enough with exes to maintain healthy friendships. Your partner expressing and talking through any feelings that might pop up is okay but demanding change of what sounds like a long term arrangement that pays you is honestly unreasonable. It's a newer relationship if it's a deal breaker for partner then they should break it off.", "NTA you both just disagree and have different boundaries for a relationship. You both just don\u2019t sound compatible.", "I was super jealous of every relationship my (now 35+ years married) husband had previously had. I had a hard time seeing it at the time but it was definitely a ME problem. I found after afterwards that I had been cheated on for years in an 8-year relationship and had zero faith in anyone else\u2019s integrity. I\u2019m so thankful my husband was patient with me and am horrified now at the way I spoke to him when something bothered me. \n\nI am not saying your relationship is doomed but I suggest you think carefully about how much you\u2019re willing to put up with, because 5 months in with Mark, this is probably the tip of the iceberg as far as insecurity and control issues.\n\nGood for you for caring for a senior dog.", "  I work in specialty vet med and I remember a divorced couple who had a very ill dog, with appointments at least once a month with internal medicine and neurology. They did such a great job at coparenting that pup it was so impressive. Thankfully, they both had partners that understood and accepted that situation as well.\n\nAnimals need consistency even more than human children imo, especially as they get older. Animals cannot comprehend human relationship changes. It\u2019s a green flag (imo) that you are still willing to do what is clearly best for this senior dog. \n\nI think it warrants a discussion about what exactly Mark is uncomfortable with, considering you do not actually see John, just his dog. And maybe explaining that it\u2019s not about what you want to do, but about what the dog needs to thrive. He might not be seeing that perspective.\n\nEdit: NAH", "Most people wouldn\u2019t be cool with this.", "NTA - But it does seem like this may have revealed a long term compatibility issue. Personally, I\u2019m not dating anyone who thinks you can\u2019t remain friends with people you have had sex with. I\u2019m also not dating anyone who asks me to leave a senior dog alone overnight while I\u2019m dogsitting that dog, especially if it would make the dog uncomfortable. I love dogs and I\u2019ve had casual hookups years ago with people who are good friends, that\u2019s a part of my life, if someone thinks that makes me suspicious or disrespectful then they are obviously not a good partner for me.", "NTA .... which might well become a yes depending on the communication you're having with Mark. \n\nYou had a casual relationship with John right? Which means it was no strings attached. Some people simply don't get that people can have those kinds of relationships and still be amicable / even friends with nothing lingering afterwards.  Five months in Mark is showing that he is jealous of a dog and innately mistrusts you - its not a control thing at all, he just clearly is the type of person who can't imagine being able to have a casual thing with a mate and not having lingering feelings of jealousy etc. you both have clearly very different intimacy styles.\n\nSo it's really not about the dog at all, and maybe you need to have a chat about other things in your relationship where he feels intimacy is lacking, and if it doesn't compute, doesn't match up or it turns out he is just actually just controlling then you might have to consider that you're not in the right match up for each other. \n\nSo, no you're not the asshole for taking your stance, but neither is he, its a genuine complaint that speaks about where he values his intimacy. You need to have a heart to heart about the bigger picture of your relationship and your genuine compatibility if I'm honest and the five month period is the perfect time to do so.", "NAH John isn't there, and you are making money while spending time with Luna. It isn't happening that often. I get why Mark doesn't like it, but he is making it a bigger issue than it needs to be.", "NTA. People have past relationships and sometimes those relationships linger for reasons that have nothing to do with feelings for the ex. Children are the most obvious, but the ex may be part of your social circle thanks to mutual friends, or may be present at some sport or activity that you both enjoy.\n\nFor some, these connections may be difficult to handle, depending on who broke up with whom, but mature adults can handle it.\n\nSimilarly, any future partner should be able to handle your connection to an ex. Your situation is a little unusual, but you\u2019ve made it obvious that Mark is your priority when it matters (e.g., Memorial Day). His discomfort (perhaps interlaced with the insecurity we all feel in the early stages of a relationship) is understandable, and he needs reassurance that this purely about Luna, not John. As an animal lover myself, I know it\u2019s not \u201cjust a dog\u201d, and I certainly missed the dogs when my ex and I split. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, and work with Mark on his discomfort.", "NTA. John isn't even there, and the bed will be freshly made, like hotelbeds. I get that he is insecure, but how is you making a bit money with dogsitting disrespectful to him?", "NTA\n\nMark is extraordinarily insecure and has taken the \"you're mine now so we have to pretend you have never dated or had sex before AND you better not have any contact with prior relationship partners\" mentality. \n\nTypically, insecure and jealous people don't change so unless you want to keep dealing with someone who is going to dictate your life based on their insecurities, I would cut Mark loose. Feeling \"disrespected\" is a red flag in itself as *respect is earned* not demanded meritlessly.", "NTA \n\n\n\nPeople can be friendly with exs, especially when animals are involved. I can see why the idea of you sleeping in an exs bed might make him feel weird, but also, the ex clearly isn't home if your dog is sitting. If there is nowhere else to sleep, that's unfortunately all you can do. His \"compromise\" of bringing the dog to his isn't a compromise when the dog doesn't like other animals. This is just a difference in boundaries. You'll have to decide if your partners feelings here are important enough to stop helping out your friend and if they aren't (and he won't budge/holds firm to this boundary) you need to decide if that's a deal breaker behavior for you.", "I can tell all of the people commenting who are upset are cishet, because this is something that would be laughable to be upset about in most of the queer community.

Easy money or not, most people would agree that taking time out of their schedule and away from their own place to stay at someone else\u2019s, even for only a temporary period, takes some extra maneuvering and energy. You don\u2019t put your life on pause to house/dogsit for just anyone. I believe this is where OP\u2019s new guy has every right to feel concerned or perplexed.

A persons bed is a private and intimate place - there's a reason that if you have guests in a house that they take the spare room. Sleeping in someone's bed signifies a certain level of involvement, and even though the casual thing with John is over, it's most definitely a boundary that is being crossed. I know for a fact that any of my ex girlfriends would feel emotionally threatened in this scenario - it's got nothing to do with control, rather that it's an element of your past relationship that continues to exist alongside your new emotional attachment to Mark. \n\nThink about it this way. Say you lived with a friend and you were away from the house regularly, and your roommate let someone sleep in your bed. Unless they were a close friend you'd be pretty annoyed, right? The context of who sleeps in your bed and your relationship with them is an important element of whether it's cool or not. Your relationship with this person was founded on sex and companionship - these almost always end because one person is more interested than the other, and presuming that you ended it to pursue a relationship, this is totally uncomfortable for the person you're seeing now.", "YTA but soft YTA\nHonestly I feel like a lot of people are missing the point here. People keep talking about the bed or whatever which feels a bit like a red herring. What it seems like this boils down to is your current partner has expressed his feelings of discomfort and your making the conscious decision to continue doing the thing that is causing the discomfort. A lot of people have said \u201coh he sounds insecure\u201d and honestly I think that makes you more of an AH if that\u2019s true. Imagine you express an insecurity to your partner and they essentially ignore it and just keep doing the thing that makes you feel insecure. When it comes to exes everyone feels differently. You don\u2019t see a problem, Mark does. This seems like you\u2019re dismissing his feelings cause you don\u2019t agree with them. Some people would be totally fine with this some people would not be. The key here is communication. Of course we don\u2019t know the full story and maybe you already did communicate but overall this feels like a discussing you should be having with your partner not strangers online.", "To start, let\u2019s reframe what the problem is here. You titled this post about dog sitting. I think anyone looking at this can tell the issue isn\u2019t that you want to watch someone\u2019s dog, it\u2019s that you\u2019ve been choosing to sleep in your ex\u2019s bed instead for a week and a half instead of trying to spend any of that time with the person you\u2019ve been in a relationship with for 5 months. Do I even need to say anything else? \n\nIt\u2019s not like you offered any solutions to him or tried to work anything out. He has every right to be upset; you aren\u2019t prioritizing him and you\u2019re not available, and your first reaction is to call it ego? Maybe you didn\u2019t do anything wrong before, it didn\u2019t seem like you had bad intentions, but you created unique situation sleeping in your exes bed for over a week, and your first response to your partner of 5 months feeling weird about it is to make it \u201cdeal with it on your own\u201d thing instead of a \u201cwhat can I do to make you feel better about things\u201d moment. I\u2019d prob tell your bf to break up with you, he deserves someone with more empathy and better communication skills.\n\nIf you\u2019re that committed to the dog, you could at least have enough respect to sleep on the couch instead of in your exes bed.
