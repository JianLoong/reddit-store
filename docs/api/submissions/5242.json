Everyone is responsible for bringing one part of the meal. We are all coming together on Christmas Day. My partner and I are bringing the vegetables and the turkey. We've bought them from a local farmer as I had wanted to use the vegetable peels and turkey carcass to make stock.\nMy partner's SIL has told MIL that she wants the carcass and MIl has told her that's fine. Annoying, but whatever. I know I can get another carcass from the local farmer, he's the husband of my friend. BIL (not married to SIL, partner has 3 brothers) messaged me to say he will be collecting the peels as normal and he would rather I put them in a box than a bag. Apparently he gets free eggs off a friend who has chickens in exchange for him giving the friend all his kitchen scraps to feed them. BIL gets the kitchen scraps from most people in the family, he doesn't get ours as we compost them. I told BIL not this year as I was going to use them to make stock for my son as we are weaning him. With son being so young, he can't have salt so I wanted to make my own stock for when I'm cooking meals for son so I know if theres salt in it. He responded with that he wasn't asking, he was telling. Partner has said that once we're done peeling the vegetable that he'll just put them in the car so BIL can't have them as son is more important than chickens. \n\nWIBTA if I took the peelings anyway? I feel like I am being as this has been the way for years. This is my first family christmas with my in laws and I dont want to get off to a bad start with them.\n\nEdit: the vegetables are of better quality than the ones we usually buy, which is why I had wanted to use them. Prepping them at home isn't an option, peeling vegetables is the only Christmas dinner task my MIL can help with as she has mobility issues. So shes looking forward to doing the peeling.
