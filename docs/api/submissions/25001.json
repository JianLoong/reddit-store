What are you going to do, wear a shirt that says \"I'm mute, not deaf\" or type the explanation into your phone for every stranger that assumes wrongly? It is entirely different for me when it comes to people you interact with regularly or more than once, though. It is both fairer to the people maybe thinking you cannot hear them (as misguided as that assumption may be) as well as the decent thing to do to not actively fake a disability you do not have, as the acquaintance said. You'd probably find it uncool if that acquaintance started to regular fake being mute to get out of conversations?", "NTA.

Heck, even the pin would bring up questions you\u2019d either have to sign or type out and you don\u2019t owe random people explanations. You\u2019re just a person trying to go about your day.

To the extent you're not simply using sign language, but ignoring people trying to speak with you or otherwise deliberately leading them to believe you're deaf, I'd say NAH for a lot of casual interactions with strangers, but YWBTA if you do this around people you see regularly, or you're inconveniencing someone by making them write out a lot of information just for you.\n\nThat is, if you're a classmate or colleague, and you led me to believe you're deaf, I might well discuss personal details in your hearing that I did not want to share with you -- not to mock you, but on the assumption you can't hear and I'm only sharing my personal matters with my intended conversational partners.  You would also be inconveniencing people to write things out for you, since they believe you can't hear them speak to you. No, you didn't actually say or write that you're deaf, but actions speak louder than words, and you certainly acted in a way which you know leads people to believe you're deaf.

Seeing that people are talking WAY too relaxed when you're around, it's an incident-waiting-to-happen that I can predict for you on the proverbial silver platter.\n\nNot that you'd mind a lot, because by then, you're already dead. POW! POW! POW! HEADSHOT!\n\nSo tell us, what are you going to do when people'll suddenly find out (because, one day, they *will*)? Sign \"Just kidding!\" at them, or \"Oops, sorry!\"? (PS.
