I'm sure some of you have a similar scenario with siblings and can relate to the fact that Josie and I have had very different upbringings. I don't think I had a bad childhood and I know my parents did their absolute best by me, just the facts are that when Josie was born they were more mature and prepared, meaning they've been able to provide her with more stability and opportunities that they could when I was a child. I am absolutely not jealous about this; if anything, I'm happy for Josie that she's getting such a good childhood. \n\nNow, the issue: our parents both have quite demanding careers, meaning long hours, so Josie spends a lot of time hanging out with my husband and I at our place. My husband and I are both IT guys in our 20s and we absolutely live like it lol. Pertinent here is the way we eat: we don't live off of junk food by any means, but neither of us is gonna say no to pizza and if we get sent home from any kind of function with leftovers, we're eating leftovers for the next few days. \n\nWhich is exactly the issue. My folks have been back at work after Christmas, so Josie has been at ours a lot. We spent Christmas day with husbands family this year, and his mam sent us home with a frankly boggling amount of leftovers, so that's mostly what we've been eating this week. This includes Josie, who has made absolutely zero complaint on her own part and has, in fact, seemed pretty happy about it since MiL is a great cook and the kid just loves turkey. However, when my mum caught wind she kinda flipped out about it. For some reason, one of her big things the past ten years has been a bit of an anti-leftovers crusade and she believes everyone should just eat freshly prepared food every day, something about depleting nutrients the longer it sits.  She got quite mad at the fact that husband and I have been feeding Josie with leftovers and had a bit of a rant about how we're depriving her of proper nutrition. I said we ate leftovers all the time when I was a kid and I turned out fine. She really went off at me about how I'm so bitter and twisted that Josie has had more stability than me and it's unfair of me to throw *my* childhood back in her face and to take it out on Josie as well. She ended up crying and hanging up the phone. \n\nI'm honestly mostly confused. Mum keeps texting me that she's sorry she was such an awful mother to me in a  way that feels quite passive aggressive and Dad called me an ungrateful arsehole for saying that to her. Josie doesn't seem to want to pick sides but the 'rents have been sending her to our aunt instead of my house when they work so there's that. From an outside standpoint, does it sound like I was an arsehole here? If I was I'll apologise because I didn't mean to be, but I want confirmation if I fucked up or not first lol.\n\nEdit: just want to add a couple of notes here because people seem to be getting the wrong idea, so I want to clarify things. \n\nFirst off, Josie doesn't come to ours because the 'rents are out gallivanting, they're just both hospital doctors (mum an obstetrician, dad an oncologist) so they don't really have typical Mon-Fri 9-5 hours and both work long shifts, often overnights. They do try to make it so theirs always someone at home whenever Josie is but obviously with those jobs it can't always be helped. \n\nSecond, mum and dad really aren't bad parents or bad people in general. They've always been very supportive, loving, attentive and kind. This is really the first proper row I've had with either of them, hence why it's throwing me so much.\n\nI should also clarify mum's definition of \"freshly prepared\" is literally just \"not leftovers\". A takeout pizza or a meal in (most) restaurants counts because it's made - or at least assembled - to order. A packet of Super Noodles counts because you cook it and eat it straight away. Pasta and sauce from a jar counts provided you eat it as soon as you make it.

Same parents, just a big age gap (I was my mum\u2019s 40th birthday present..!). As such, I had a very different upbringing than my siblings as our parents were more financially secure, experienced, and mature when they had me. My brother is very understanding of this and we get on great, but my sister holds me responsible for the differences in our upbringing and, as such, we don\u2019t really talk. It\u2019s a real shame but, as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s her problem. \n\nI mention this because sibling relationships with big age gaps/differences in upbringing/the way this affects your relationship with your parent(s) can be really tricky to navigate and none of these subjects get discussed a lot.

I would have a snack, do homework, my chores and watch TV. At the age of 12 or 13 my mom taught us simple dinners to make like hamburger helper. My first experience was interesting, I had to defrost hamburger in the microwave and hamburger helper says to brown the meat so I thought that was browning the meat and mixed raw meat into the pack and we had to toss it and my mom corrected me and explained it, but it's a funny story to tell now", "NTA.", "NTA also your parents suck.", "NTA you were not judging your parents you were stating a fact.

That isn't how any of this works! Her beliefs are nonsensical, and this is part of why I question whether or not she's actually matured as a parent. If she had, then she would have spent five seconds on Google to see if her \"parenting\" intuitions had any basis whatsoever in reality. She apparently either hasn't done that or did that and decided not to trust the results. Either way not exactly a parenting feather in her cap.\n\n>She got quite mad at the fact that husband and I have been feeding Josie with leftovers and had a bit of a rant about how we're depriving her of proper nutrition. I said we ate leftovers all the time when I was a kid and I turned out fine.\n\nThis is an accurate statement without a hint of passive-aggressiveness in it. From the overall tone of your post and these sentences in particular I do not at all get the sense that you were doing some sort of nasty \"well it was good enough for me but not your precious Josie\" routine or anything, you were just matter of factly stating that leftovers were fine and you had them yourself growing up. Both true statements.\n\n>She really went off at me about how I'm so bitter and twisted that Josie has had more stability than me and it's unfair of me to throw my childhood back in her face and to take it out on Josie as well. She ended up crying and hanging up the phone. \n\nThis is pure projection. **She** feels guilty about the different childhoods you and Josie had. **She** feels like she didn't do enough for you and is defensive about it, so she interprets even clearly neutral statements from you as attacks on her over this subject because that's what defensive people do. She apparently hasn't been willing to face or deal with these feelings herself, so they're boiling away just under the surface and will explode out at anything even remotely resembling a comment on the subject.\n\n>I'm honestly mostly confused. Mum keeps texting me that she's sorry she was such an awful mother to me in a way that feels quite passive aggressive\n\nThat's because she's being incredibly passive aggressive. If you're actually sorry about something like that this isn't how you communicate it. She feels guilty about it but doesn't want to accept that she feels guilty about it because that would mean accepting that she did poorly by you and that's not part of her self image as a mother, so she's angry that she thinks you brought it up (you didn't, you made a neutral factual statement and her pent up guilt caused her to project her own feelings about her parenting on to you) and is now sarcastically claiming responsibility in a way that lets her reassure herself that she was a great parent and you're the problem.\n\n>and Dad called me an ungrateful arsehole for saying that to her.\n\nEither she told your dad what she convinced herself that she heard rather than what you actually said, or your dad is doing the same thing she is where he knows he's doing better with Josie, feels guilty about it, doesn't WANT to feel guilty about it, and is exploding at you for what he thought was you calling him out.\n\n>Josie doesn't seem to want to pick sides but the 'rents have been sending her to our aunt instead of my house when they work so there's that.\n\nThis also makes me question their supposedly improved maturity as parents. They thought you were the best place to send Josie, then they got mad at you, so now they're sending her to their second choice of sitter.

I figured that might be a good way to establish independence at home, in addition to the other aforementioned reasons. My mom immediately got upset and defensive, going on about how she wished she could only worry about herself and other things that seemed out of character.

It wasn\u2019t, but her own insecurities soured the meaning of what I was trying to say. (Well, that, and I may have worded the request poorly lol.)\n\nBut yeah, point is, I would talk to her.
