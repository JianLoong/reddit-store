I'm sure some of you have a similar scenario with siblings and can relate to the fact that Josie and I have had very different upbringings. I don't think I had a bad childhood and I know my parents did their absolute best by me, just the facts are that when Josie was born they were more mature and prepared, meaning they've been able to provide her with more stability and opportunities that they could when I was a child. I am absolutely not jealous about this; if anything, I'm happy for Josie that she's getting such a good childhood. \n\nNow, the issue: our parents both have quite demanding careers, meaning long hours, so Josie spends a lot of time hanging out with my husband and I at our place. My husband and I are both IT guys in our 20s and we absolutely live like it lol. Pertinent here is the way we eat: we don't live off of junk food by any means, but neither of us is gonna say no to pizza and if we get sent home from any kind of function with leftovers, we're eating leftovers for the next few days. \n\nWhich is exactly the issue. My folks have been back at work after Christmas, so Josie has been at ours a lot. We spent Christmas day with husbands family this year, and his mam sent us home with a frankly boggling amount of leftovers, so that's mostly what we've been eating this week. This includes Josie, who has made absolutely zero complaint on her own part and has, in fact, seemed pretty happy about it since MiL is a great cook and the kid just loves turkey. However, when my mum caught wind she kinda flipped out about it. For some reason, one of her big things the past ten years has been a bit of an anti-leftovers crusade and she believes everyone should just eat freshly prepared food every day, something about depleting nutrients the longer it sits.  She got quite mad at the fact that husband and I have been feeding Josie with leftovers and had a bit of a rant about how we're depriving her of proper nutrition. I said we ate leftovers all the time when I was a kid and I turned out fine. She really went off at me about how I'm so bitter and twisted that Josie has had more stability than me and it's unfair of me to throw *my* childhood back in her face and to take it out on Josie as well. She ended up crying and hanging up the phone. \n\nI'm honestly mostly confused. Mum keeps texting me that she's sorry she was such an awful mother to me in a  way that feels quite passive aggressive and Dad called me an ungrateful arsehole for saying that to her. Josie doesn't seem to want to pick sides but the 'rents have been sending her to our aunt instead of my house when they work so there's that. From an outside standpoint, does it sound like I was an arsehole here? If I was I'll apologise because I didn't mean to be, but I want confirmation if I fucked up or not first lol.\n\nEdit: just want to add a couple of notes here because people seem to be getting the wrong idea, so I want to clarify things. \n\nFirst off, Josie doesn't come to ours because the 'rents are out gallivanting, they're just both hospital doctors (mum an obstetrician, dad an oncologist) so they don't really have typical Mon-Fri 9-5 hours and both work long shifts, often overnights. They do try to make it so theirs always someone at home whenever Josie is but obviously with those jobs it can't always be helped. \n\nSecond, mum and dad really aren't bad parents or bad people in general. They've always been very supportive, loving, attentive and kind. This is really the first proper row I've had with either of them, hence why it's throwing me so much.\n\nI should also clarify mum's definition of \"freshly prepared\" is literally just \"not leftovers\". A takeout pizza or a meal in (most) restaurants counts because it's made - or at least assembled - to order. A packet of Super Noodles counts because you cook it and eat it straight away. Pasta and sauce from a jar counts provided you eat it as soon as you make it.

They plant seeds of doubt and criticism in you until you grow up questioning everything you do because of them, and the seeds they planted transform into an overgrown garden of all of the questions and lies you tell yourself every day because of everything they ever told you that you still hear in your head throughout your life.\n\nYou didn\u2019t screw up.

I can totally relate to this situation, but probably more from Josie\u2019s perspective. My sister is 21 years older than me, and my brother is 19 years older than me. Same parents, just a big age gap (I was my mum\u2019s 40th birthday present..!). As such, I had a very different upbringing than my siblings as our parents were more financially secure, experienced, and mature when they had me. My brother is very understanding of this and we get on great, but my sister holds me responsible for the differences in our upbringing and, as such, we don\u2019t really talk. It\u2019s a real shame but, as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s her problem. \n\nI mention this because sibling relationships with big age gaps/differences in upbringing/the way this affects your relationship with your parent(s) can be really tricky to navigate and none of these subjects get discussed a lot.

I would have a snack, do homework, my chores and watch TV. At the age of 12 or 13 my mom taught us simple dinners to make like hamburger helper. My first experience was interesting, I had to defrost hamburger in the microwave and hamburger helper says to brown the meat so I thought that was browning the meat and mixed raw meat into the pack and we had to toss it and my mom corrected me and explained it, but it's a funny story to tell now", "NTA.", "NTA also your parents suck.", "NTA you were not judging your parents you were stating a fact.

That isn't how any of this works! Her beliefs are nonsensical, and this is part of why I question whether or not she's actually matured as a parent. If she had, then she would have spent five seconds on Google to see if her \"parenting\" intuitions had any basis whatsoever in reality. She apparently either hasn't done that or did that and decided not to trust the results. Either way not exactly a parenting feather in her cap.\n\n>She got quite mad at the fact that husband and I have been feeding Josie with leftovers and had a bit of a rant about how we're depriving her of proper nutrition. I said we ate leftovers all the time when I was a kid and I turned out fine.\n\nThis is an accurate statement without a hint of passive-aggressiveness in it. From the overall tone of your post and these sentences in particular I do not at all get the sense that you were doing some sort of nasty \"well it was good enough for me but not your precious Josie\" routine or anything, you were just matter of factly stating that leftovers were fine and you had them yourself growing up. Both true statements.\n\n>She really went off at me about how I'm so bitter and twisted that Josie has had more stability than me and it's unfair of me to throw my childhood back in her face and to take it out on Josie as well. She ended up crying and hanging up the phone. \n\nThis is pure projection. **She** feels guilty about the different childhoods you and Josie had. **She** feels like she didn't do enough for you and is defensive about it, so she interprets even clearly neutral statements from you as attacks on her over this subject because that's what defensive people do. She apparently hasn't been willing to face or deal with these feelings herself, so they're boiling away just under the surface and will explode out at anything even remotely resembling a comment on the subject.\n\n>I'm honestly mostly confused. Mum keeps texting me that she's sorry she was such an awful mother to me in a way that feels quite passive aggressive\n\nThat's because she's being incredibly passive aggressive. If you're actually sorry about something like that this isn't how you communicate it. She feels guilty about it but doesn't want to accept that she feels guilty about it because that would mean accepting that she did poorly by you and that's not part of her self image as a mother, so she's angry that she thinks you brought it up (you didn't, you made a neutral factual statement and her pent up guilt caused her to project her own feelings about her parenting on to you) and is now sarcastically claiming responsibility in a way that lets her reassure herself that she was a great parent and you're the problem.\n\n>and Dad called me an ungrateful arsehole for saying that to her.\n\nEither she told your dad what she convinced herself that she heard rather than what you actually said, or your dad is doing the same thing she is where he knows he's doing better with Josie, feels guilty about it, doesn't WANT to feel guilty about it, and is exploding at you for what he thought was you calling him out.\n\n>Josie doesn't seem to want to pick sides but the 'rents have been sending her to our aunt instead of my house when they work so there's that.\n\nThis also makes me question their supposedly improved maturity as parents. They thought you were the best place to send Josie, then they got mad at you, so now they're sending her to their second choice of sitter.

So many foods even taste better the 2nd day -- think soups, chili, casseroles, mac & cheese, etc. that being anti-leftovers cuts out an awful lot of good food.", "Uh your parents don\u2019t have to be bad people to be subpar parents \n\n\u201cNot neglectful\u201d is a low bar. \n\nI fail to see the stability they\u2019re providing. They had Josie when they had an adult kid to provide childcare. \n\nNTA your mom can sit with her choices for a while, as can your dad. \n\nReal interested to hear how much they contribute to you financially to provide such consistent care and meals", "NTA - I would not trust your mom as my ob", "So let me get this right. You are providing free childcare for your sister and your parents are complaining about what she is eating? But they have failed to provide an alternative. And YOU are the ungrateful one? LMAO. NTA.", "NTA. 1. Has your mother not heard of food waste? 2. If she wants her daughter to eat freshly peppered food every day, then she and your father should cook it. But also 3. If you're still eating leftovers from nearly a week ago and it wasn't frozen, it's time to toss it.", "I mean, Josie is getting a different upbringing because she\u2019s being brought up by a different person. *You*.\n\nPeople who outsource parenting don\u2019t get to have an opinion on how the parenting is done.", "NTA. Why isn\u2019t your mom packing a meal for your sister everyday?", "NTA\n\nI wouldnt say, you throw your childhood in her face. It sounds more like an argument, cause you wanted to understand. \"why was it okay to eat leftovers in your childhood, and know its not.\"", "**NTA**\n\nYou didn't say anything wrong. Unfortunately your Mum just took it the wrong way. What you basically said was: \"I had leftovers as a kid and it didn't hurt me nutritionally.\" \n\nWhat your Mum heard was: \"I had leftovers as a kid and it was terrible.\" You and your Mum should probably sit down and try to figure out what's going on for her to have gone so completely off the rails. You did nothing wrong at all. Maybe Mum is just tired, who knows, but I think a serious conversation is long overdue if she's going off and getting the wrong impression from such a tiny sentence that was meant as completely harmless.", "Your comment is the reason why I read these posts.  It's very insightful and I appreciate it.     NTA", "\u2b06\ufe0f This!  Parents are still shitty.  Amen.", "Bingo. It's truly a sad state of affairs but I'm so glad OP is there for Josie.", "This is just the mom projecting her shit on to her son. OP does not even resent his parents at all so what is the problem?", "Yes, fancy jobs do not equate to stability. Josie is lucky to have a brother that cares so much for her!", "They sound super out-of-touch. They're doctors and probably don't know the struggle of people starting their careers. Kinda sounds like Arrested Development. \"It's only 1 banana. How much could it cost? $10?\"", "I think people are really playing fast and loose with the word \"neglect\" here. I'll give you that there might be a degree of parentification in regards to myself (though I don't think it's anything concerning as I never took care of her beyond normal older sibling babysitting til I was in my early 20s and it was of my own volution), but let's maybe pump the breaks on throwing around such serious terms as \"neglect\". Both of us have always had our physical, mental and emotional needs met and it doesn't help anyone to trivialise something as serious as neglect by pretending this one incident constitutes that.", "She needs to produce some meaningful studies or back off. Also if nutrition is lost is it even a significant amount? Every single meal doesn't need to be nutrition packed", "Was looking for this comment. This is exactly what's going on, mom is displacing her anger and guilt on OP for being an absent parent to Josie, and she found something small to wig out about. NTA OP.", "Mom feels bad. She\u2019s carrying her guilt around like a concealed weapon. She wouldn\u2019t make it past the TSA.", "This is a bit much lol neither of us have ever been neglected.", "She can\u2019t, which is why she doesn\u2019t. Which is fine, but people in glass houses\u2026", "I should clarify mum's definition of \"freshly prepared\" is literally just \"not leftovers\". A takeout pizza or a meal in (most) restaurants counts because it's made - or at least assembled - to order. A packet of Super Noodles counts because you cook it and eat it straight away. Pasta and sauce from a jar counts provided you eat it as soon as you make it. You get the gist.", "I think you're right on needing to have a sit down and talk with your mum. You have no ill will to how you were raised, but that doesn't mean she doesn't feel guilty in some way about it, and even now about Josie as it seems your parents are working quite a bit. She's allowed those feelings, and I think she overreacted and displaced them onto you, but maybe some reassurance would help her see she's done what you feel is a great job as a mom. She definitely owes you an apology too.", "Shut down the passive aggression, though. Your sis is fine, you're okay, and leftovers are the best bit of this bit of Christmas. As well as Quality Street. You're doing brilliantly. Obviously NTA, and Happy 2023!", "It boggles my mind that as physicians your parents think packet noodles and store bought pizza are healthier than homemade leftovers. Also no nutrition does not deplete over time like they think it does. Not exactly. Unless of course the food has gone bad which is a completely different issue. NTA op. Also they're cheapskates for relying on you for free babysitting and then blaming you for not living up to their ridiculous standards", "I think your mum feels guilty she couldn't provide for you as a kid as she can now for Josie, so she heard what she wanted/feared you thought. She's also a bit of an idiot when it comes to food o.O NTA in any case.", "Listen, you obviously are NTA. Your mum and dad are slightly being assholish but they aren\u2019t total assholes; I can tell by the way you love and defend them. Here\u2019s the thing: tell your mom blatantly, \u201cyou\u2019re a doctor, so you should know and understand as well as anyone that having a takeout (junkfood) day every once in a while isn\u2019t going to hurt *anyone*. And let her know if she *doesnt* understand that, to have a chit chat with one of the dietitians at the hospital. Also, remind her how happy and loving your relationship is with Josie; remind her how bonded you are, and how it\u2019d be silly to both ruin your bro/sis relationship *as well* as your entire familial dynamic over friggin **leftovers**!!! Again, NTA\u2026wish you well!!!", "That is absolute insanity. She is not allowed to complain about reduced nutrition if she's not raising and slaughtering her own animals on site and growing your other food.", "NTA. Maybe your Mum thinks leftovers =a less than life? OMG love a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce, or hot gravy & turkey over leftover mashed. I agree she has some kind of internal trauma that she needs to figure out. \nHappy New Year OP. Hope things improve", "I'm sorry but I'm cackling over \"leftovers made me gay.\"", "I don't think she'd like that stew(ing), it wouldn't be fresh anymore after a few hours LOL", "Right you get it, it's hunter-gatherer or nothing, *Susan*", "Be very careful. There\u2019s a crunchy-to-alt-right pipeline.", "Your parents are kooks. It's great that you're providing a good spot for your sister. I hope your aunt has kids so your sister has something to do.", "Gotta say, little concerning that a guilt-tripping person, with a neurotic fixation about food only being nutritious when it's labor-intensive, works in the profession she does. \n\nI'm always on my soapbox about how \"breast is best\" people are part of a really [insidious, misogynistic, anti-science movement](https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/12/the-breast-feeding-extremists-who-put-lactivism-ahead-of-protecting-babies-from-hiv.html). It might be a reach to apply that to your mother based on the information provided, and it's certainly a tangent from the actual issue you're having with her, but I'm always looking for an excuse to talk about it because it's so bleak and fascinating.", "That's why I consider her crunchy adjacent rather than just crunchy. She's an obstetrician and dad's an oncologist so they're also pretty clued in about most stuff vis a vis medical science so they're also not into a lot of the woowoo psuedoscience the crunchy parents do, moreso just a lot of the \"let's run around barefoot in the woods and burn lots of incense and only buy organic produce from the bulk buy place\" side of things. Mostly it's kind of nice to be around in that sort of hippy dippy crystal shop primary school art teacher kind of way, this is really the first issue we've run into with it. \n\nAlso let it be known that I was not only allowed to drink out of the garden hose as a kid, I once left a cup outside and it filled up with rainwater and my dad let me drink it after it had been sat there for two days and I'm still here fighting fit lol.", "I have the garden hose to thank for my immune system."]}
