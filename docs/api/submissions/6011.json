I'm sure some of you have a similar scenario with siblings and can relate to the fact that Josie and I have had very different upbringings. I don't think I had a bad childhood and I know my parents did their absolute best by me, just the facts are that when Josie was born they were more mature and prepared, meaning they've been able to provide her with more stability and opportunities that they could when I was a child. I am absolutely not jealous about this; if anything, I'm happy for Josie that she's getting such a good childhood. \n\nNow, the issue: our parents both have quite demanding careers, meaning long hours, so Josie spends a lot of time hanging out with my husband and I at our place. My husband and I are both IT guys in our 20s and we absolutely live like it lol. Pertinent here is the way we eat: we don't live off of junk food by any means, but neither of us is gonna say no to pizza and if we get sent home from any kind of function with leftovers, we're eating leftovers for the next few days. \n\nWhich is exactly the issue. My folks have been back at work after Christmas, so Josie has been at ours a lot. We spent Christmas day with husbands family this year, and his mam sent us home with a frankly boggling amount of leftovers, so that's mostly what we've been eating this week. This includes Josie, who has made absolutely zero complaint on her own part and has, in fact, seemed pretty happy about it since MiL is a great cook and the kid just loves turkey. However, when my mum caught wind she kinda flipped out about it. For some reason, one of her big things the past ten years has been a bit of an anti-leftovers crusade and she believes everyone should just eat freshly prepared food every day, something about depleting nutrients the longer it sits.  She got quite mad at the fact that husband and I have been feeding Josie with leftovers and had a bit of a rant about how we're depriving her of proper nutrition. I said we ate leftovers all the time when I was a kid and I turned out fine. She really went off at me about how I'm so bitter and twisted that Josie has had more stability than me and it's unfair of me to throw *my* childhood back in her face and to take it out on Josie as well. She ended up crying and hanging up the phone. \n\nI'm honestly mostly confused. Mum keeps texting me that she's sorry she was such an awful mother to me in a  way that feels quite passive aggressive and Dad called me an ungrateful arsehole for saying that to her.

They plant seeds of doubt and criticism in you until you grow up questioning everything you do because of them, and the seeds they planted transform into an overgrown garden of all of the questions and lies you tell yourself every day because of everything they ever told you that you still hear in your head throughout your life.\n\nYou didn\u2019t screw up.
