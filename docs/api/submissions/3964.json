She wouldn't be getting those checks unless her bipolar disorder was causing her REALLY SERIOUS problems.", "I bet you ten bucks that her mom is the reason for her anxiety.", "Exactly. The older sister has a proven disability. Sister #2 is still working to prove hers. The niece may have disabling social anxiety, but she can\u2019t prove it because she hasn\u2019t seen a doctor for her issues. It\u2019s certainly possible they are all faking it, but there is absolutely no evidence of that here.   \n\n\nThere is evidence here that they have been spending well beyond their means, including frivolous spending.  They need to take responsibility for putting themselves in a living situation that they can afford.   \n\n\nNTA for not enabling them with money or opening up your own home, OP.   I understand that they\u2019ve refused all suggestions to improve their situation before, but I would continue to over, for a brief time, with offers to help expiring when they get kicked out.   \n\n\nGood luck.  I think it\u2019s kind of you to try to help them, but you don\u2019t need to let them guilt trip you when their own poor choices catch up with them."]}
