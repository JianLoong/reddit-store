I\u2019m not hating on Christians but seeing how my sister and her boyfriend act is repulsive. My mom begged me to let her join me and my husband\u2019s dinner party to celebrate my birthday. I really didn\u2019t want a lot of people there and just wanted a nice diner and a fun night with my husband. But he and my daughter panned an entire dinner party with a 30 guests.

I had enough, they would go out of their way to make Scenes like this at every given moment.
