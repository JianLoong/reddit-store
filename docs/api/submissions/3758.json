He was having a baby with his girlfriend/now wife (50). \n\nMy mom was a stay at home mom and didn't finish college.  She had gotten pregnant with my older brother (42). My father was an ass and made the divorce as shitty as possible for my mom.  \n\nWe ended up moving in with my paternal grandparents.  He was their only child and they were disappointed in him. They helped my mom go back to school. Once she finished school she wanted to pay them back but they wouldn't let her.  They also basically disowned my father. He was invited over for Thanksgiving and Christmas but that was about it.  They did love their other grandchildren though. They always provided gifts and contributed to their education.  \n\nMy grandmother passed away a few years ago from breast cancer. And my grandfather passed away last year from complications related to COVID. And he left everything to my brother and I.  It wasn't a huge estate. And it's not life-changing money.  Both my brother and I are well established in our careers.  They left my father $500.  The lawyer explained that it was a way of avoiding him being able to challenge the will.  They also left each of my half siblings $10,000.  My brother and I each got over $100,000.  My grandfather said that since my brother and I had grown up without a father, by his choice, but his other children had then he felt this was fair.  \n\nHe also left my mom his house and some money. She had been taking care of them for a long time and they never stopped thinking of her as a daughter. \n\nMy father approached my brother and I recently saying that his other kids are struggling with finance and that we should split everything with them since we really don't need the money. He also tried to get my mom to renounce her inheritance. She laughed in his face and asked for all the child support he owed. \n\nI get that it's not my half siblings' fault but they had a dad to take care of them growing up and we didn't. So neither my brother or I agreed to share. \n\nNow my father, his wife, and all my half siblings are calling us assholes for being so greedy and not helping them through the hard time they are going through.  \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT\n\nYes $100,000 is a lot of money.  When I said it wasn't life changing I meant that I would still have to work for a living.  I would still have to save for my retirement. I would still have a mortgage.   I hope I didn't come off as 1%.", "created_utc": 1669989058, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zamt8a/wibta_if_i_dont_share_my_inheritance_with_my_half/", "score": 1122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
