Her autism is irrelevant to the fact they need to find alternative care. It's lovely that you're in her life, but there are sitters and nannies who specialize in special needs childcare. It could do a lot of good for them to set her up with an occupational therapist on regular evenings. She can work on life skills while they get some adult time.\n\nCongrats on charging $100 an hour. That's a fair rate for you to cancel your plans.", "\"if i don\u2019t then they won\u2019t do anything.\"\n\nHere's the thing.  They put up that barrier themselves.  There are plenty of capable people, baby sitters, and services they can use to get a night out of the house.   And they deserve a night out of the house, but not at your exclusive expense.  No matter how many times you suggest it, they won't agree to look elsewhere for whatever reason.\n\nYou can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink.

They know how to manipulate you and apparently, are quite good at it.  You need to learn to set the boundary and enforce it.  They will up the ante when you do but stick to it and go about your business.\n\nShe is THEIR child and THEIR responsibility.  If they can't find a sitter they like then they will have to stay home.  That is THEIR problem.  Maybe they need to spend their time finding additional childcare they trust rather than going out and foisting her on you.", "This whole situation is NOT your responsibility at all! What are they going to do if you have kids and won't have the time? They are her parents not you. If they wanted time to themselves they should not have had another child.", "NTA\n\nAlso, start putting the idea into their heads that once they\u2019re no longer around, you will not be your sister\u2019s full-time caretaker.", "\"Sister deserves more than to be seen as a burden, but by constantly asking me to babysit -- especially after I've told you that I am busy -- you are rapidly turning her into one. It is incredibly irresponsible to not to take advantage of the fact that I *am* occasionally available to find other trustworthy sitters. You *must* start actively searching for other options and trying them out so you'll be prepared for an emergency and so you stop treating her like she's a burden. I don't want to do something drastic like tell you that every time you pressure me for an extra job I'll refuse it *and* cancel one of the scheduled dates, but I'm rapidly getting to that point.\"\n\nNTA. Your parents are failing you *and* your sister by not finding alternatives. Any time they attempt to guilt trip you, I highly encourage you to remind them of your boundary then hang up on them if they persist on discussing it... By listening to them when they continue to pressure you, you are encouraging their bad behavior", "NTA\n\nCare for autistic children is difficult and taxing, you're not obligated to provide it. They need to find/make alternative arrangements in any case, since if their pool of potential sitters is that low there could be situations where neither of you is available even if it's an emergency/urgent and they'll be left scrambling then. Guilt is a funny thing, and people do guilt trip without meaning to, but you should feel no compunction when they start doing so about telling them \"stop. I've said no, I need you to respect that or I'm going to hang up\"\n\nIf it might help (and you're still willing to do 2x a month), tell them that you will watch her 2 times in a month on days/times when you are free and have no plans, they need to pick the days at least a week in advance, and it's up to *them* to decide which things they need/want to do are most important to them.", " NTA, totally understand even with months in advance you want to say no. When someone constantly asked for you to do something that isn\u2019t your job or is always inconvenient or feels guilted into doing, you start to never want to do it even if you have every option to do it, so I don\u2019t blame you for feeling that way. They need to get someone who can do the job most the time and only ask you occasionally, like 2 or 3 times a year max! You should be able to see your sister because you want to, not because you have to, this could definitely lead to a bad relationship with your sister and possibly making you resent her if they keep this up.", "NTA. Try explaining that not having alternative child care can be a serious problem, what if one of your parents needs to go to the hospital and you aren't around? Also start saying \"no\" more frequently, say that you have friends over or that you have a concert or other things planned.", "NTA, and your parents need to figure out caregivers for her that don't include family.

Not your child, not your responsibility.", "NAH - Your parents are definitely putting a lot of pressure on you about this. They need to start interviewing sitters. They should post the job opening that explains that they need someone who understands about autism as well. It's not your responsibility to pause your life and babysit your sister all the time. Continue to set boundaries and say no without guilt.", "NAH\n\nYour sister's severe autism that requires a constant caregiver is hard on the entire family. I worked with this population and I understand your parents have concerns about turning to outsiders for respite care, but ultimately that is what they are going to need to do. You or the other person they trust could move away, or have children of your own, or be too busy. Your sister is going to require care for the rest of her life. They are going to get older and sicker (happens to all of us) and they need to not just have 1-2 family members in their corner, they need to start NOW developing a network of trusted respite care people who they can call on to help out once a week, or every other week, so that they get breaks. So I would continue to set boundaries and I would continue to encourage them to pursue outside respite care.
