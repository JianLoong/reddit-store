They know how to manipulate you and apparently, are quite good at it.  You need to learn to set the boundary and enforce it.  They will up the ante when you do but stick to it and go about your business.\n\nShe is THEIR child and THEIR responsibility.  If they can't find a sitter they like then they will have to stay home.  That is THEIR problem.  Maybe they need to spend their time finding additional childcare they trust rather than going out and foisting her on you.", "This whole situation is NOT your responsibility at all! What are they going to do if you have kids and won't have the time? They are her parents not you. If they wanted time to themselves they should not have had another child.", "NTA\n\nAlso, start putting the idea into their heads that once they\u2019re no longer around, you will not be your sister\u2019s full-time caretaker.", "\"Sister deserves more than to be seen as a burden, but by constantly asking me to babysit -- especially after I've told you that I am busy -- you are rapidly turning her into one. It is incredibly irresponsible to not to take advantage of the fact that I *am* occasionally available to find other trustworthy sitters. You *must* start actively searching for other options and trying them out so you'll be prepared for an emergency and so you stop treating her like she's a burden. I don't want to do something drastic like tell you that every time you pressure me for an extra job I'll refuse it *and* cancel one of the scheduled dates, but I'm rapidly getting to that point.\"\n\nNTA. Your parents are failing you *and* your sister by not finding alternatives. Any time they attempt to guilt trip you, I highly encourage you to remind them of your boundary then hang up on them if they persist on discussing it... By listening to them when they continue to pressure you, you are encouraging their bad behavior", "NTA\n\nCare for autistic children is difficult and taxing, you're not obligated to provide it. They need to find/make alternative arrangements in any case, since if their pool of potential sitters is that low there could be situations where neither of you is available even if it's an emergency/urgent and they'll be left scrambling then. Guilt is a funny thing, and people do guilt trip without meaning to, but you should feel no compunction when they start doing so about telling them \"stop. I've said no, I need you to respect that or I'm going to hang up\"\n\nIf it might help (and you're still willing to do 2x a month), tell them that you will watch her 2 times in a month on days/times when you are free and have no plans, they need to pick the days at least a week in advance, and it's up to *them* to decide which things they need/want to do are most important to them.", " NTA, totally understand even with months in advance you want to say no. When someone constantly asked for you to do something that isn\u2019t your job or is always inconvenient or feels guilted into doing, you start to never want to do it even if you have every option to do it, so I don\u2019t blame you for feeling that way. They need to get someone who can do the job most the time and only ask you occasionally, like 2 or 3 times a year max! You should be able to see your sister because you want to, not because you have to, this could definitely lead to a bad relationship with your sister and possibly making you resent her if they keep this up.", "NTA. Try explaining that not having alternative child care can be a serious problem, what if one of your parents needs to go to the hospital and you aren't around? Also start saying \"no\" more frequently, say that you have friends over or that you have a concert or other things planned.", "NTA, and your parents need to figure out caregivers for her that don't include family.

Not your child, not your responsibility.", "NAH - Your parents are definitely putting a lot of pressure on you about this. They need to start interviewing sitters. They should post the job opening that explains that they need someone who understands about autism as well. It's not your responsibility to pause your life and babysit your sister all the time. Continue to set boundaries and say no without guilt.", "NAH\n\nYour sister's severe autism that requires a constant caregiver is hard on the entire family. I worked with this population and I understand your parents have concerns about turning to outsiders for respite care, but ultimately that is what they are going to need to do. You or the other person they trust could move away, or have children of your own, or be too busy. Your sister is going to require care for the rest of her life. They are going to get older and sicker (happens to all of us) and they need to not just have 1-2 family members in their corner, they need to start NOW developing a network of trusted respite care people who they can call on to help out once a week, or every other week, so that they get breaks.

Then stick to the plan, and review it after 6 months. This way you have been very clear and unambiguous and you are taking control of the situation. \n\nIf your parents pick the dates, only giving you a week's notice, there is too much opportunity for things to slip back to how they were before, for example you might babysit the last two weekends of September and then the first two of October, and suddenly you have done 4 in a row. Then by the end of October your parents might wear you down, because they have not been out for so long, and your boundary goes out the window.\n\nIf fitting in with your schedule does not suit your parents, that is their problem, not yours.\n\nNTA", "I'm glad it helped! \n\nA lot of the time, a change in how you frame something can shift how people think about it. Giving them a set amount of days to 'spend' both helps you to set firmer boundaries and makes them more obviously responsible for not prioritizing better.

What can they do if something happened to you and you couldn't assist them.\n\nThey need to find a provider they trust.\n\nThey can start off with having the provider watch the child when they are home.", "NO is a complete sentence! You are building resentment because it appears your parents are doing absolutely nothing about securing alternative, regular care. You should have zero guilt if these adults, your parents, are ignoring and disregarding the wishes and life choices of their first child.  Where has their care and love for you gone? How is your life so easily disregarded by them?\n\nThis is only going to get worse as your sister gets older and more difficult to handle. They need to research and secure local options for her current and long-term care, and especially in the case of an emergency. It is amazingly ignorant of them to not have that lined up already, and then to put that burden on their other child.\n\nI am a grandmother in my 60's that works full time, and I would feel exactly as you do. You're working to build your own life now, and you should be able to enjoy your free time, after fulfilling your life obligations, without pressure to take on the wants of the people who are supposed to care about you the most. It appears that you're a good person, working to support yourself, and you've earned it.\n\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't help them occasionally, especially since you love your family, it should just never be expected or coerced.\n\nPlease feel free to share my comments (or other's here) if it will help you have a conversation with them that is long overdue.\n\nStay strong. Take care of yourself, no one can do it for you."]}
