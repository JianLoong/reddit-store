Mother is making OP the centre of her world to the exclusion of everything else, and when OP moves out she's likely to feel lost, lonely, unfulfilled and unhappy, because she doesn't seem to have any other outlets like hobbies or friends to fill the gap that will be left with the absence of her child. \n\nShe's also infantilising OP to OP's detriment. This is going beyond nice gestures. Her determination to do absolutely everything for OP sends a message that she thinks OP is incompetent, even though OP clearly isn't, and has repeatedly asked her not to do these things.\n\nIt's smothering behaviour and is clearly backfiring, since OP is moving up the timeframe to leave, and is more likely to go low contact to get away from such an overbearing parent. Mother is damaging the relationship with her constant meddling and disrespecting of OP's boundaries. \n\nI would say NAH, but the mother is definitely straying into AH territory by continuing to ignore OP's requests.

My mom has always struggled with boundaries, so our relationship improves when we live separately. She is someone who likes to talk every day, which isn\u2019t feasible so I try to meet her in the middle. Thankfully, I have a little sister in college so she has someone to dote on. Unfortunately for her my sister is very independent and rarely comes home.", "I'm genuinely curious: You think it's normal for OP to re-wash her laundry (wasting water, energy, and detergent) to prove a point? Or to waste food to prove a point? You don't think OP is an asshole at all? Not even a little bit? \n\nOP doesn't claim that anything her mother does comes with any strings. OP also complains about a lack of independence; however, where how are her parents interfering with that? OP is not, for example, prohibited from having friends over. She isn't prohibited from going out. She isn't prohibited from dating. She isn't told she has to be home by a set hour or even that she has to do certain chores. (We know all of this to be true because otherwise OP would have written about how her parents were legitimately stopping her from being independent.)   \n\nAt the end of the day, we should all be so lucky to have parents who are as generous as OP's mother. I get that it's not much fun to be living at home in your mid\u201320s. But OP could have it a whole lot worse. And in case you doubt that, read some of the truly bizarre threads that people post every day.\n\n(Also if I were giving personal advice, I'd advise OP to read and learn about love languages.)", "So when I had my kids that were young adults living at home, I did their laundry. I don\u2019t like other people using my washing machine. I would also pack their lunches, but I was making my lunch (if it was on a Saturday they were on their own).  But if I was already doing it, it was easy for me to make one for them also. If I was cooking dinner of course they were welcome to eat with us. It wasn\u2019t me keeping them as a child, it was me already doing it.", "YOu DID move back, because living on your own did not work out in some way, so living with mom seemed to be the better option.", "Username checks out.", "I stand by OP ignoring your judgment and analysis.", "Could you encourage your mum to take up hobbies, like joining a book club or something, so she has more outside interests?", "Thankfully a lot of that stopped the first time I moved out. I used to have a strict curfew, was interviewed when I dated/went out, they were very much the \u201cmy house, my rules, I\u2019ll come in your room when I want/look through things,\u201d type of people. They\u2019ve really loosened up once I forced those boundaries in place. My mom still struggles at times though.", "It's not normal for parents of adult children to constantly hover over them, doing chores they've been asked multiple times not to, and try to actively curtail their independence when they've been independent for years. \n\nI don't think anyone's the AH in this situation; I can understand both the mother's and OP's feelings. OP is redoing their laundry etc to assert their independence, to try and make their mother understand that they don't want her doing their laundry and making food. \n\nMother is controlling, and this is where she's going into AH territory. It isn't about love language, it's about the mother's need to control everything around her. OP says she has always been overbearing. \n\nWhen a parent refuses to listen to their child and respect their boundaries, the child is going to do things to reassert those boundaries, that we might not approve of or understand. If my mother constantly did these things despite my repeated exhortations to please not to, I might do the same as OP to try and get my message across.\n\nThat kind of 'luck' is the type most people who aren't entirely dependent on their parents can do without. You may see it as a plus, but when micromanaging your adult child is affecting that child in a detrimental way, it's not about love, it's about not being able to relinquish control, and not being able to (or not wanting to) separate your personhood from your identity as a parent. \n\nA healthy love language would entail asking your perfectly capable child if they wanted you to do their laundry and pack their lunch, especially at times when they couldn't get round to doing it themselves because of work, study or other commitments. Treating them like an infant who needs spoonfeeding, despite them telling you and showing you multiple times that they neither need nor want that, is something else.", "I moved back home because the lease ended for my school apartment, and I could only rent it as a student. I was no longer allowed to rent it, because I graduated. My therapist and parents advised me to move back home because my best friend was murdered by my other friend during finals weeks, and I found the car he was killed in. My therapist told me to move back home, because my ptsd and anxiety made it hard to study for my licensing exam when I was alone. However, I have maintained full time employment during this time and have never neglected daily living activities or basic care, which indicates that I do not need help with those tasks.", "She has a decent amount of ohobbies.

She also works part time too, she has just always been a micro manager.", "I don't see the micromanaging, here. The only thing that comes close is when OP and her friend were baking cookies. Perhaps they might have invited mom to join in as opposed to having her hover? \n\nWhat I'm seeing here is a mother who wants to be closer to her daughter. I see a daughter pushing mom away while living rent free. \n\nAnd that OP's parents were overbearing in the past is irrelevant. Even OP says they're not overbearing now.", "Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt will be good for you to  - at some point - strike out on your own again and stop living with your mom.

You can't continue to ignore your child's requests and boundaries after being asked multiple times not to. \n\nThe fact that OP is living rent free doesn't entitle the mother to take liberties. OP has a right to be respected regardless of whether they're paying rent or not. Even if they were paying rent, I doubt the mother's overbearing behaviour would stop. \n\nAnd it is overbearing, just in a different way. Mother knows she can't dictate where and when OP comes and goes, but she's still trying to have some semblance of control, and laundry and food is how it's now manifesting. \n\nI get it, mother is stoked to have her child back at home, and is trying to keep OP tied to her apron strings because she doesn't want to let go. But she has to let go if she wants a healthier, adult relationship with her adult child.\n\nJust because you personally don't see it as a problem, and think OP should be grateful to have a mother who cares, it doesn't mean that this isn't a problem for OP and they should just suck it up. The fact that OP is leaving the home earlier than they planned to, because of the mother's smothering, indicates that there is a problem.\n\nNo doubt mother cares for and loves OP.

It may be that she wants to be part included in your everyday activities and this is the only thing she can think of, not sure But while her actions might be interpreted as babying you your actions could be construed as ungrateful and mean. I\u2019m sure there are kinder ways to get your point across regardless of how unpopular my opinion will be.", ">If she does my laundry, I take it off the drying rack and re wash all of it.  If she tries to pack my lunch, I leave it out and pack my own food. \n\nI mean, YTA for wasting water and detergent like that.  And when you say \"leave it out\" - do you mean you don't even put it back in the fridge or whatever?  Good lord.  You're like the definition of passive-aggressive. \n\nStop wasting water and food in this pointless fight you're having with your mother.  The climate doesn't care about your \"need for independence\".\n\n>I sped up my move out date because I feel like I am going crazy.\n\nThat's because you're acting crazy.  I get that your mom is overstepping her bounds, and she hasn't listened to your repeated requests to stop, but the solution isn't to waste resources as if parts of the US aren't in extreme drought conditions.\n\nBut speeding up your move out date is a good idea.  How about next week?  Because if you can't restrain yourself from being wasteful, then you need to remove yourself from the situation that is causing you to act irrationally as quickly as possible.", "\u2b06\ufe0f this \u2b06\ufe0f", "NTA, but OP, one solution is to send her over to my house.  I have a ton of laundry and a constant mess.  It would be heaven for her over here!!", "What if you sit her down and explain that you love her and want to have a relationship with her as an adult, especially after you move out (subtext being that it's not guaranteed and she needs to make some changes). Tell her how her behavior makes you feel and that she is damaging your relationship. \n\nMaybe instead of her smothering you and running roughshod over your boundaries, you can plan baking days or times that you watch a show together while you fold your own clothes.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
