There was no particular reason for the swap, her son is an adult and doesn't pay rent. It's time he moves out, or both of them do. It's crazy", "NTA...She admitted she was wrong.  She needs to undo what she did.", "NTA\n\nI don't know that I'd end the marriage. I would switch the bedrooms back immediately. Take the day off work, hire movers, and do it. Also, put the son's crap in one bedroom, and take the third room to be used as an office or something. He needs incentive to move out. After everything is moved, explain to your wife that this is a hard limit for you. If she moves him back, you're leaving. \n\nI would also stop supporting her son financially.", "NTA. Please update us with the outcome", "NTA\n\nThe freeloading 20 year old should appreciate that you let him live there rent-free. Your wife **really** did you wrong here.  You should never have accepted this!", "NTA.\n\nTen months later? I'd have mad that dude swap that shit back within ten minutes of my return home, and if it wasn't well underway moving back when I got home, anything that wasn't would end up on the lawn and he'd be moving out, as of today.\n\nIf I were you I'd count all  your valuables, move them to a safe deposit box off site, count all your money, and quietly change the signers on the accounts so she can't rob you blind. This is how divorces where the innocent party just gets cleaned out happen--because they were too passive until it was too late. This is an enormous breach of trust, what others has she perpetrated that you haven't discovered yet?\n\nPut your foot down, man. This is total BS, and you don't deserve this treatment.", "NTA - Your wife deceived you and I'm not sure why you didn't change it straight back.

But after that *healthy* marriages put their partners, & also the marriage above the wishes of their children. \n\nI love that you recognize this, about healthy marriages. \n\nYou aren't just saying all this because it's a marriage & you demand to be placed higher than her child. Not at all, you recognize a parent's role with their children. \n\nYou simply want at least *some* consideration as the partner, and what you're asking for is NOT harmful to the child. They may not like it, but it's not harmful. \n\nWhat they are expecting of you is harmful tho, to your relationship. I hate to say it, but she doesn't seem to be an invested in this relationship as you are. The whole secret switcheroo was very shady, and disrespectful.", "So the adult living at home rent free has the GA to suggest that he get the master bedroom?\n\nNo.  If he wants a bigger room, he can move out and rent his own place.\n\nI have serious trouble believing this is real.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is a two card situation. You hand your wife two cards; one for a marriage counselor, and one for a divorce lawyer.Tell her to choose. \n\nI also think that you have been unbelievably patient to wait 10 months and not kick that entitled child out of your room.", "NTA\n\nThe way your wife went about this whole thing was terrible. She knowingly deceived you. She knowingly went against your wishes and did not at any point take your needs into account.\n\nYou need to stop all financial support for this \u2018child\u2019. You need to take your room back. You also need to decide whether or not this marriage is worth it.", "NTA, you handled that like the mature adult you are.   \nYou gave it 10 months.

If he wants a big room with a fridge and computer/gaming set up, then he should pay for one, he\u2019s not entitled to your bedroom.", "NTA. I can't believe he has the master bedroom without paying any rent.", "NTA - the level of duplicity and complete disregard  for you from your wife is galling.  I would have a hard time coming back from this personally.  How do you not lose respect and regard for her or faith in your marriage when she did this?", "Nta. I'd take a weekend and have them switch it back. It isn't fair to you especially when he isn't footing any bills.", "Nta, this is wild to me I wouldn't have let it go on 10 months.  All of this is so he can play video games in the same room? JFC", "NTA- I\u2019m having a hard time understanding why he needed the master bedroom though? What was the \u201csafety\u201d issue?", "Divorce that that wife man. She doesnt really care about your boundaries. NTA", "NTA. And you nailed it. She placed her sons wishes above your wishes in your own home. Not his needs, or his safety but his wants. This is not only terrible behavior for a spouse but also, quite honestly, horrible parenting. Son is an adult, living at home, not paying any rent. He should have been grateful to have a room and incredibly grateful to have been offered an additional room for his computer/gaming needs. \nIt\u2019s up to you (and your wife) if this is the hill for your marriage to die on but I\u2019m appalled that your wife would do this to you", "NTA. Dude, this wife of yours needs to go. There is not point trying to be level-headed about it.

Get rid of both of them as they have no care at all for your wellbeing", "NTA-her son has some nerve and she completely doesn't respect you.

Now you need to choose your own comfort and leave her. You will never be her first choice. Been there, done that, lost the house and t-shirt.", "NTA. The 20 year old needs to move out if he wants a bigger room.", "Nta", "NTA - your wife is making it too comfortable for her son.  He won\u2019t ever want to leave, because he has it very comfortable where he is.  Raising kids is hard, but I have found that dealing with a minor child is easy compared to launching a legal adult son on his own.  It take a lot of thought and work on providing the the incentives for a legally adult son to launch himself to become a self sufficient independent adult.  \n\nGiving him the master bedroom so that he will be more comfortable is a mom treating her son like he is a 5 yr old, rather than a 20 yr old.  A mom of a 20 yr old when the 20 yr old asks for the bigger bedroom so that he is comfortable must respond with, Son, when you can afford to pay for your own place, you can have the master bedroom.\n\nMy son, when he was in high school, we had a conversation about college.  He was planning to major in engineering.  I said, here is the deal, 4 yrs = degree, job, place to live.  He was like huh?  Just what I said.  You are going off to college to get a degree in your chosen career field.  You need to graduate in 4 years and you have to plan for having a job ready to go when you graduate, and you will need to find a place to live and assume responsibility for your own expenses.  That\u2019s what being an adult means.  He looked around our beautiful house and said, why can\u2019t I live here?  I replied, this is my house that I worked really hard for.  It took me 2 decades to get to this house and this lifestyle.  You need to make your own way in the world, you need to be responsible for your own living expenses.  And the reward for that is you get to make your own decisions, you don\u2019t have me telling you what to do.  However, I am your mom, and I will always be your port in a storm.  I will be here to help you get up when you fall down.  But I will not pick you up, I will help you or advise you.  You are about to become an adult and with that comes responsibility for being an adult.\n\nYour wife is harming her child by giving him the best bedroom in your house.  She is teaching him that he doesn\u2019t need to work for it and earn the money for it.  He just has to ask mommy, and mommy will give it to him.\n\nSo, you and your wife need to have a long talk about what I have said, and it\u2019s not just about walking back the bedroom swap.  It\u2019s about what incentives is your wife providing to her son to get him to launch himself.  I would also suspect that your wife doesn\u2019t what her son to become independent and self sufficient because then he won\u2019t need her.  But that is the circle of life.  He grows up, moves out, and she becomes an empty nester, able to do all the things she didn\u2019t have time for when she was raising her son.  So, what is her next life purpose because raising kids is a temp job with a termination date that ends when they become adults.  Making him so comfortable that he wants to stay and never leave is a way for your wife to keep raising him rather than letting him go and pushing him to become a self Sufficient independent adult that he can be.\n\nFYI - my son went off to college, and I was clear with him that he had to get a part time job to pay for his extras (pizza, books) because that\u2019s what responsible adults do and he is a responsible adult.  My son is now in his mid 20s, he hit all the goals that I set for him, and exceeded them because as he accomplished things on his own, he gained confidence to tackle the next thing.  He has his own place with his own stuff, and is thriving.", "NTA - since we have to vote, but you all need to go to therapy. Including your wife and her son.", "NTA\n\n& i\u2019m just gonna wait for the update to see if she values her marriage or her son\u2019s comfort (& perpetual tenancy) mote", "NTA.   You're  way nicer than I would have been\n\nI'd  have lost my shit if I came home to my  house and my room was swapped without my ok.", "NTA and I\u2019m trying to imagine having the unmitigated gall of her son, to contribute nothing to the house and demand the master bedroom over your mother, the homeowner, just for your computer set up!", "NTA\n\nAnd the real issue here is not that she put her sons 'needs' (he does not need the room he wanted it) above yours the issue is that your wife did not communicate her feelings on giving her son the room and instead did this behind your back. \n\nTo me this shows she does not respect you or the relationship enough to have a proper discussion and come to an agreed upon solution and feels lying and sneaking around is an acceptable way to behave. She has broken your trust and that is not okay.", "NTA but wait, this happened 10 MONTHS ago?  And you're still living that way???   I would have checked myself into a hotel or gone to stay with a friend and said \"I'll be home when you put it back the way it was.\"  \n\nThis is just completely unacceptable, he's 1 person who pays zero dollars in rent.  He does not get the biggest room so he can have his games with him.", "AITA For putting our marriage on the line?", "NTA\n\nI will say, some of the stuff near the end about pecking order and second place is a bit...eh. A parent will always put their child first in general. BUT that doesn't mean that they should put superficial desires of their child above their partner's comfort. It doesn't sound like the son had actual practical issues with his old bedroom, he just wanted more space to have the computer setup in the same room. That should not be enough reason to just swap bedrooms so TWO people can have HALF the space. If he had issues with not enough space in general, perhaps you could work out something else, but with the agreement of everyone involved.\n\nEither way, what your wife did behind your back is absurd. She knew you'd be upset so she made sure you wouldn't be around to veto the move. That's very shitty; whether it's divorce level shitty is probably up to you.", "Nta, put your big boi pants on and either kick that guy out, or tell her to return the besroom as it was", "NTA. Unless she rights the situation by her own efforts you need to plan to leave.\n\nAnd here is the kicker. If she blames you, you walk. You are not to blame for their conniving and lies.\n\nPersonally I would actually move to a hotel or something and end the marriage.", "NTA\n\nEnd the marriage.  You rank so far below the son, you are of no consequence.  She did this on purpose, while you were away, and when given the opportunity to tell you in advance, or discuss it further, chose to not confront you.  She is dishonest, and deceitful.  She is unworthy of someone who provides so much to her and her son.\n\nNo normal person will place a second spouse above their children, but this is WAY over the top.  No spouse is worth this type of aggravation.   Document everything, find yourself a great divorce lawyer and get it over with.  There are plenty of fish in the sea, and most of them will not lie and deceive you.\n\nPersonally I would move everything he has to the smallest bedroom, indicate that rent would be starting at the first of the month, with a penalty for late payment.  I would use the second bedroom as I see fit, probably to put my wife in while the divorce proceeded.  Separate the finances, as it has to be done, you might as well get it over with.  Start looking for someone who values you and your generosity, and get on with your life.  Life is too short for this type of crap.\n\n!updateme", "I am surprised you lasted as long as you did. I would have packed my shit that first night and slept somewhere else, stopped putting money into the house expenses, and made a point of it, too. Her son wants the master suite and let him pay your share. As your marriage spouse, she did a pretty stupid thing. Hope you figure out what you want out of all this crap.", "INFO: is it your house or your wifes house?\n\nBut NTA. It is not okay to do that behind your back. Especially as she knew you weren't okay with that. As she hasn't done anything for the last 10 months and ignored your feelings and wishes for that topic, it is not over the line to give her that ultimatum. You should give her a deadline until when she has to make her decission.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your wife\u2019s behavior was manipulative and untrustworthy, I\u2019m afraid. She\u2019s treating her son like a spoiled prince instead of an adult son she\u2019s helping out. She has, unfortunately, raised her son to be ungrateful, selfish, and entitled. Upon hearing that his stepfather did not agree to give up the master bedroom in his own home, a decent man of 20 would have immediately put everything back the way it was, and promptly apologized.\n\nThat your wife is enabling this entitled, callous behavior of her son is very troubling. It shows she does not value your marriage. This is a grown man. He needs to be treated as such. She also treated you like a child by asking forgiveness instead of agreement, as in a healthy marriage partnership. She allowed this to continue for 10 months, while the wedge in her marriage grew.\n\nHer son is not disabled, requiring extensive medical equipment that just won\u2019t fit in a smaller bedroom. There is no need for this. She is ruining her marriage over nothing.\n\nYou need to be respected and important in your home and marriage. That\u2019s the crux of the problem. It sounds like you\u2019ve been willing to support her son, so you\u2019re doing your bit. Speaking of which, why does he live with you? Is he going to college or trade school? If not, then he needs to get a job, and rent a room or studio apartment like everyone else.\n\nThis marriage needs to be a respectful partnership, he goes back to his room or better yet, moves out, or you might consider divorce.\n\nRemember, as you grow older, this woman is whom you\u2019ll need to trust when life gets really hard.

They would have had until I got home from work to get that computer and all of his crap out of my room, or it would be on the lawn.

You should not have accepted this in the least and they are using you.

Maybe you could update your post with the update. You were definitely NOT the arsehole here. Your wife needs to accept that all kids move out eventually.\n\nI was widowed at 33, our daughter was 17.

I'm perfectly happy pottering around the garden alone with my dog and chickens. My daughter and her family keep me going and while we're not physically close we see each other at least once a month.

Her changing rooms the way she did shows clearly that you are second compared to her adult son. If the house is in her name and something ever happens to her, you can bet she will leave the home to one of her kids- probably the one that had the audacity to ask for your room in the first place.  If you are counting on this kid or her others to care (be there in a loving way) for you in your old age, that is not going to happen based on this kid's entitled behavior.  Frankly, you should consider cutting your losses now with a wife who would treat you in such a manner and her entitled using kid/s. I wouldn't want to grow old with someone who would put me on the back burner  while putting their entitled adult children first. Also, wait for the grandbabies to come along- hello permanent babysitter in your retirement years and a constant money bleed.
