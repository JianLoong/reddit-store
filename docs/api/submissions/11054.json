My wife\u2019s 20 year old son still lives with us & asked her to swap his small bedroom for our master bedroom which is twice the size of his now former bedroom (he pays nothing towards rent or utilities) \n\nThe gain for him is that his computer setup up instead of being in the third unused bedroom is in his bedroom with his dorm size refrigerator. The gain for us nothing. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to sound like an ogert so I said I would consider it if we made scaled drawings to see if it could work.  Weeks later I realized I was way too uncomfortable with the idea & told my wife I changed my mind to no\nBedroom swap. \n\nWeeks later she had a Monday legal holiday off, & so did her son. The day before the holiday we go to breakfast & also drive 1.5 hours away (just the two of us) to visit one of my vendors to transact a deal.

What will you do with your day off tomorrow I ask. \u201cOh we will find something to do.\u201d  \n\nLate at work I get a text, be sure to call me before you get home.  After work I call to hear: \u201cI wanted you to know she says sheepishly \u201cI moved your books to the third bedroom\u201d.  What about your son\u2019s computer won\u2019t he find that cumbersome?  Oh i moved his computer too, but into our bedroom.  What?  Where is our bed, oh in my son\u2019s old bedroom, I swapped out bedrooms while you were at work. \n\nI went ballistic & days later she admitted she knew for days what she would be doing on Monday.  She eventually apologized, & said she knew it was wrong to do that behind my back. But it was only for two years until he launched himself.  I almost left her over this. \n\n10 months later the swap has been an unmitigated disaster for me. \n\nI gave her plenty of warning & took a weekend for myself & wrote out my feelings, & diagramed out the dynamics. \n\nI realized that every parent has to put their child\u2019s safety over their partners wishes. But after that healthy marriages put their partners, & also the marriage above the wishes of their children.   \n\nI came home from the weekend & told her that. I reminded her that I have helped her son financially, took him to games, gave him my used car (his first) when I upgraded. \n\nI also told her his current bedroom situation was completely appropriate when he had his own place. But it was completely inappropriate at the expense of her husband\u2019s comfort & that she had to make a choice. Either explain to him  (as I am certain he knows) my /our bedroom was stolen behind my back & the current one for us is not working for me as I have to be a contortionist to use even part of the too narrow closet & there is not enough room for my tings. \n\nOr it\u2019s time I accept where I am in the pecking order, & I don\u2019t do second place & end this marriage.

She needs to undo what she did.", "NTA\n\nI don't know that I'd end the marriage. I would switch the bedrooms back immediately. Take the day off work, hire movers, and do it. Also, put the son's crap in one bedroom, and take the third room to be used as an office or something. He needs incentive to move out. After everything is moved, explain to your wife that this is a hard limit for you. If she moves him back, you're leaving. \n\nI would also stop supporting her son financially.", "NTA. Please update us with the outcome", "NTA\n\nThe freeloading 20 year old should appreciate that you let him live there rent-free. Your wife **really** did you wrong here.  You should never have accepted this!", "NTA.\n\nTen months later?

This is an enormous breach of trust, what others has she perpetrated that you haven't discovered yet?\n\nPut your foot down, man. This is total BS, and you don't deserve this treatment.", "NTA - Your wife deceived you and I'm not sure why you didn't change it straight back.

But after that *healthy* marriages put their partners, & also the marriage above the wishes of their children. \n\nI love that you recognize this, about healthy marriages. \n\nYou aren't just saying all this because it's a marriage & you demand to be placed higher than her child. Not at all, you recognize a parent's role with their children. \n\nYou simply want at least *some* consideration as the partner, and what you're asking for is NOT harmful to the child. They may not like it, but it's not harmful. \n\nWhat they are expecting of you is harmful tho, to your relationship. I hate to say it, but she doesn't seem to be an invested in this relationship as you are. The whole secret switcheroo was very shady, and disrespectful.", "So the adult living at home rent free has the GA to suggest that he get the master bedroom?\n\nNo.  If he wants a bigger room, he can move out and rent his own place.\n\nI have serious trouble believing this is real.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is a two card situation.

She knowingly deceived you. She knowingly went against your wishes and did not at any point take your needs into account.\n\nYou need to stop all financial support for this \u2018child\u2019.

I can't believe he has the master bedroom without paying any rent.", "NTA - the level of duplicity and complete disregard  for you from your wife is galling.  I would have a hard time coming back from this personally.  How do you not lose respect and regard for her or faith in your marriage when she did this?", "Nta. I'd take a weekend and have them switch it back. It isn't fair to you especially when he isn't footing any bills.", "Nta, this is wild to me I wouldn't have let it go on 10 months.

She placed her sons wishes above your wishes in your own home. Not his needs, or his safety but his wants. This is not only terrible behavior for a spouse but also, quite honestly, horrible parenting. Son is an adult, living at home, not paying any rent. He should have been grateful to have a room and incredibly grateful to have been offered an additional room for his computer/gaming needs. \nIt\u2019s up to you (and your wife) if this is the hill for your marriage to die on but I\u2019m appalled that your wife would do this to you", "NTA.

Now you need to choose your own comfort and leave her. You will never be her first choice. Been there, done that, lost the house and t-shirt.", "NTA. The 20 year old needs to move out if he wants a bigger room.", "Nta", "NTA - your wife is making it too comfortable for her son.  He won\u2019t ever want to leave, because he has it very comfortable where he is.  Raising kids is hard, but I have found that dealing with a minor child is easy compared to launching a legal adult son on his own.  It take a lot of thought and work on providing the the incentives for a legally adult son to launch himself to become a self sufficient independent adult.  \n\nGiving him the master bedroom so that he will be more comfortable is a mom treating her son like he is a 5 yr old, rather than a 20 yr old.  A mom of a 20 yr old when the 20 yr old asks for the bigger bedroom so that he is comfortable must respond with, Son, when you can afford to pay for your own place, you can have the master bedroom.\n\nMy son, when he was in high school, we had a conversation about college.  He was planning to major in engineering.  I said, here is the deal, 4 yrs = degree, job, place to live.  He was like huh?  Just what I said.  You are going off to college to get a degree in your chosen career field.  You need to graduate in 4 years and you have to plan for having a job ready to go when you graduate, and you will need to find a place to live and assume responsibility for your own expenses.  That\u2019s what being an adult means.  He looked around our beautiful house and said, why can\u2019t I live here?  I replied, this is my house that I worked really hard for.  It took me 2 decades to get to this house and this lifestyle.  You need to make your own way in the world, you need to be responsible for your own living expenses.  And the reward for that is you get to make your own decisions, you don\u2019t have me telling you what to do.  However, I am your mom, and I will always be your port in a storm.  I will be here to help you get up when you fall down.  But I will not pick you up, I will help you or advise you.  You are about to become an adult and with that comes responsibility for being an adult.\n\nYour wife is harming her child by giving him the best bedroom in your house.  She is teaching him that he doesn\u2019t need to work for it and earn the money for it.  He just has to ask mommy, and mommy will give it to him.\n\nSo, you and your wife need to have a long talk about what I have said, and it\u2019s not just about walking back the bedroom swap.  It\u2019s about what incentives is your wife providing to her son to get him to launch himself.  I would also suspect that your wife doesn\u2019t what her son to become independent and self sufficient because then he won\u2019t need her.  But that is the circle of life.  He grows up, moves out, and she becomes an empty nester, able to do all the things she didn\u2019t have time for when she was raising her son.  So, what is her next life purpose because raising kids is a temp job with a termination date that ends when they become adults.  Making him so comfortable that he wants to stay and never leave is a way for your wife to keep raising him rather than letting him go and pushing him to become a self Sufficient independent adult that he can be.\n\nFYI - my son went off to college, and I was clear with him that he had to get a part time job to pay for his extras (pizza, books) because that\u2019s what responsible adults do and he is a responsible adult.  My son is now in his mid 20s, he hit all the goals that I set for him, and exceeded them because as he accomplished things on his own, he gained confidence to tackle the next thing.  He has his own place with his own stuff, and is thriving.", "NTA - since we have to vote, but you all need to go to therapy. Including your wife and her son.", "NTA\n\n& i\u2019m just gonna wait for the update to see if she values her marriage or her son\u2019s comfort (& perpetual tenancy) mote", "NTA.   You're  way nicer than I would have been\n\nI'd  have lost my shit if I came home to my  house and my room was swapped without my ok.", "NTA and I\u2019m trying to imagine having the unmitigated gall of her son, to contribute nothing to the house and demand the master bedroom over your mother, the homeowner, just for your computer set up!", "NTA\n\nAnd the real issue here is not that she put her sons 'needs' (he does not need the room he wanted it) above yours the issue is that your wife did not communicate her feelings on giving her son the room and instead did this behind your back. \n\nTo me this shows she does not respect you or the relationship enough to have a proper discussion and come to an agreed upon solution and feels lying and sneaking around is an acceptable way to behave. She has broken your trust and that is not okay.", "NTA but wait, this happened 10 MONTHS ago?  And you're still living that way???   I would have checked myself into a hotel or gone to stay with a friend and said \"I'll be home when you put it back the way it was.\"  \n\nThis is just completely unacceptable, he's 1 person who pays zero dollars in rent.  He does not get the biggest room so he can have his games with him.", "AITA For putting our marriage on the line?", "NTA\n\nI will say, some of the stuff near the end about pecking order and second place is a bit...eh. A parent will always put their child first in general. BUT that doesn't mean that they should put superficial desires of their child above their partner's comfort. It doesn't sound like the son had actual practical issues with his old bedroom, he just wanted more space to have the computer setup in the same room. That should not be enough reason to just swap bedrooms so TWO people can have HALF the space. If he had issues with not enough space in general, perhaps you could work out something else, but with the agreement of everyone involved.\n\nEither way, what your wife did behind your back is absurd. She knew you'd be upset so she made sure you wouldn't be around to veto the move. That's very shitty; whether it's divorce level shitty is probably up to you.", "Nta, put your big boi pants on and either kick that guy out, or tell her to return the besroom as it was", "NTA. Unless she rights the situation by her own efforts you need to plan to leave.\n\nAnd here is the kicker. If she blames you, you walk. You are not to blame for their conniving and lies.\n\nPersonally I would actually move to a hotel or something and end the marriage.", "NTA\n\nEnd the marriage.  You rank so far below the son, you are of no consequence.  She did this on purpose, while you were away, and when given the opportunity to tell you in advance, or discuss it further, chose to not confront you.  She is dishonest, and deceitful.  She is unworthy of someone who provides so much to her and her son.\n\nNo normal person will place a second spouse above their children, but this is WAY over the top.  No spouse is worth this type of aggravation.   Document everything, find yourself a great divorce lawyer and get it over with.  There are plenty of fish in the sea, and most of them will not lie and deceive you.\n\nPersonally I would move everything he has to the smallest bedroom, indicate that rent would be starting at the first of the month, with a penalty for late payment.  I would use the second bedroom as I see fit, probably to put my wife in while the divorce proceeded.  Separate the finances, as it has to be done, you might as well get it over with.  Start looking for someone who values you and your generosity, and get on with your life.  Life is too short for this type of crap.\n\n!updateme", "I am surprised you lasted as long as you did. I would have packed my shit that first night and slept somewhere else, stopped putting money into the house expenses, and made a point of it, too. Her son wants the master suite and let him pay your share. As your marriage spouse, she did a pretty stupid thing. Hope you figure out what you want out of all this crap.", "INFO: is it your house or your wifes house?\n\nBut NTA. It is not okay to do that behind your back. Especially as she knew you weren't okay with that. As she hasn't done anything for the last 10 months and ignored your feelings and wishes for that topic, it is not over the line to give her that ultimatum. You should give her a deadline until when she has to make her decission.", "NTA for the bedroom situation but \u201cI don\u2019t do second place\u201d?? If you do end this marriage don\u2019t date someone with kids ever again. Kids will always come before a partner regardless of age.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This should never have gone on for 10 months.", "for fucks sake, generally used to emphasize a point. also no need to apologize!", "My pleasure!  when my son was a teen, I started to notice all of the other older teens (newly minted legal adults), and saw how there were all these failure to launch scenarios\u2026 or even worse, kids would go off to college, finish with a degree, but then were tired and needed a break, so they came back \u201chome\u201d to have a vacation, and figure out what they want to do next\u2026. Able bodied young adults resting on their parent\u2019s dime\u2026 what the hell\u2026 I would talk to parents, and the general consensus was that they (the kids) would eventually figure it out\u2026 I\u2019m like but there is no incentive for them to figure it out because you have made it so comfortable for them to be lazy on your dime.  That wasn\u2019t the way when I was their age, I had to go to work, my parents were not going to be busting their asses every day and let me sit home \u201cresting\u201d and \u201cfiguring myself out\u201d\u2026 but I had blue collar parents who had to work and expected their kids to work as soon as they were old enough\u2026", "Agreed. NTA.", "Of course. I didn't say he is a child, just her child in the broader sense. I was talking about parents and their children in general, because 'child' is a gender neutral term that sounds a bit better than offspring. In this case, he's a full grown adult and could also just move out instead of doing any of this.", "I did not say this situation was an appropriate place to put her adult child before her spouse. I was responding to OP\u2019s statement of \u201cI don\u2019t do second place\u201d which was a broad statement not pertaining to this specific situation. There will 100% be times when a kid needs to come before a partner regardless of how that partner feels about it and if he can\u2019t handle that he needs do move on.", "Hey I learned, and your FFS was very well\nPlaced.", "Considering how thought out he has gone with this and waited 10 months thinking it over. I feel he accepts that there are times the kid comes first.\n\n>I realized that every parent has to put their child\u2019s safety over their   \npartners wishes. But after that healthy marriages put their partners,   \n& also the marriage above the wishes of their children.\n\nThese two sentences honestly sum up that."]}
