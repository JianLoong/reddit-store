Does your family generally use you as their whipping boy?", ">disrespecting their beliefs\n\nAnd how about YOUR belief, that this is all BS?\n\nFace facts: *your family will never forgive you for having survived*, when your twin died.

And holding your sister hostage? Do they know how ridiculous that sounds?", "The FUCK? NTA! The spirit medium is the asshole. What an awful thing to say to a family. That being said, your family also sounds unhinged. They need serious therapy for believing you are in ANY way at fault here.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry they said those things to you.", "NTA, obviously. They wanted reaffirmation, fell for a grift and now blame you because they didn't get what they want.\n\nHowever, ~~it seems like~~ they 100% still have heavy grief that they're not willing to deal with and they're even passing it on their other kids.

That's delusional of them to think you have any control of the ghost of your twin sister that your didn't even know and don't think or believe is hanging around you. I dunno, make a big show around them of saying \"Sister's name, I love that you've been watching over me so much, but I would love it if you watch over our parents and siblings, too.\" Or something like that. Maybe that would appease them. And they could probably use some therapy too.", "NTA. Your family is delusional to think you can hold a person's spirit hostage.", "NTA. They have lost their pacifier.

They are also being preyed on by a charlatan who will be taking money from them for doing this.\n\nIf they keep insisting on it then just tell them that you can connect to your sister but in order to do so the spirits need them to pay you the money instead of the medium.  Then your sister can tell them whatever it is they want to hear.  You won't change their beliefs but they will be happier and you will have some money.
