I applaud my daughter every time she tries something new and I don't press her to decide whether she likes it or not. New foods for young kids can take several tries before a kid likes it or ultimately decides they don't. \n\nPlease bring this up to your wife. It's bad to create food anxiety with kids. Don't let her do this. \n\nAlso, setting a kid up to lie is a parent fail. Reassuring your child they don't need to lie because you are safe to be honest with is always better. Punishing lying like that instead of having a discussion about it and letting them know they can trust you with the truth will just make them more wary and feel that you don't understand their feelings.", "That poor baby!

This does not encourage honesty. \n\nA far better response would have been to tell your child that she doesn\u2019t need to tell people what they want to hear and that she has a right to her own feelings. However your wife seems to be overlooking the fact that it is also often appropriate to give responses that may not be 100% honest, but are polite. Sadly I don\u2019t think your wife was actually interested in teaching your daughter. I think she was toying with her emotionally much like a cat toys with a mouse.", "WOW.....\n\nNTA. Although tbh I was pretty concerned when you said your wife was going to make her drink the whole thing...

This is honestly more concerning to me than a lot of what I've read on here. I'm actually quite concerned about the family dynamics. I know, I know, it's hard to know from one anecdote. But it's a bizarre anecdote, and your wife's response is just as upsetting. How your 5 year old daughter is a pathological liar (seriously?!!) and you are a bad parent. She's resorting to gaslighting so fast, and I'm concerned about your girl. She made her drink an entire soda she didn't like (which is like 3 adult sodas) and then still told her \"You were lying!

Would drinking 3 sodas she didn't like be not enough punishment?\n\nEither way, this is NOT healthy, and not how most 5 year olds are raised.\n\nAND 5 year olds tell tales a bit sometimes. It's normal. I still remember, my niece, I guess she was 4, like a year ago, she said her choc cupcake disappeared when we were in the other room. She INSISTED this was true. We asked her how, and finally she said maybe the dog? I asked her if this was true, because if so, it would mean the doggy had to go to the vet tonight and he hates that. She thought for a bit, and said maybe something else happened to it. I asked her if she was sure she hadn't eaten it still, and she said she didn't think so but maybe. If I would have pressed in that directed she would have admitted. I was really proud of her though. I really don't know or care if it was an intentional lie. Making her dog go through something he didn't like was enough to convince her to change her story, even though in her mind it meant not getting another cupcake. I can't remember if she got another cupcake, but we were proud of her for changing her basically surely untrue story for the sake of the dog. Also she had chocolate on her face I believe, and the cupcake wouldn't have seriously harmed the dog, so we weren't risking the dog's life on that. And hey, we exaggerated too about the vet!\n\nLittle kids exaggerate and \"lie.\" I'm still not totally convinced whether they understand they are lying or not, but who cares.\n\nA lie about liking soda pop....

Third, her method is manipulative and abusive:\n\n- she tried to force her to admit to lying on pain of punishment, but the only one that can know if she really does like it or not is the 5 year old!!!

Rather than a valuable moment about trying new things and communicating what we like and don't like your daughter will be scared. \n\nFurthermore, I worry that any \"lying\" with her is a fear on part of your five year old to discuss things with mum that might make her upset. She was trying to impress her mother, try something new and articulate how she feels. Now she is confused that she got stuck in a situation, mum trapped her into communication she does not undersand where now she is in trouble. This is very destructive parenting and your wife needs to seriously re evaluate. \n\nA 5 year old is not a \"liar\". She is developing and scared of mums reactions. Calm, non punative approach needed. \nMum: \"Did you knock that over?\"\nChild: \"NO I didn't\"\n\nOption 1 - Punitive: \"You're a liar and will be punished\" \nOption 2 - Restorative: \"Are you sure it wasent you? I'm sure it wasent on purpose right? You know honey, telling the truth is really important, and if it was an accident then I'm not cross just help me clear it up. If you did knock it over by accident we can clear it up together and maybe think about how to avoid it next time. If it was you and you still say it wasent then maybe you need to go away and think about it and come back to me when you have a different answer. (You have to be SURE it was the kid)\" \n\nOption 1 gives no learning, no chance for repair and remedy. It essentially teaches nothing. \n\nOption 2, the child might lie, might double down on not telling the truth, it may become necessary to use consequence to demonstrate that truth is important. Note, that consequence is different from punishment. A child must logically be able to connect \"I didn't tell the truth for something I should not have done and mum loves me but needs me to know that was not ok\". The point is to try and teach. The child is not labled a \"liar\" but gets taught about the importance of truth in a non confrontational way. \n\nYour wife absolutely did se set your daughter up for failure there. The confusion is completely in keeping with a kid that does not understand the escalation of the situation and the punishment. She accepts but does not understand. This will cause and leave hurt and confusion which is very unhealthy for attachment. As she gets older with a firmer sense of justice parenting such as this will lead her to push against percieved injustice.\n\nI am unsure how you should communicate this to your wife. It is not about \"letting things slide\" but fostering a healthy relationship of logical consequence for the child. This was not logical for your daughter and achieved nothing.

Why can't the kid try a small portion.  Teaching portion control is a good thing.", "Yeah, my daughter loves hot chocolate. She also never finishes more than like, an eighth of her cup. We don\u2019t enjoy wasting stuff when our kids don\u2019t finish, but we\u2019d rather they listen to their bodies when they\u2019re full than force anything. And our kids regularly get candy from the gas station or something, eat a bit, ask to save it for later, and then we end up throwing it away weeks later after it\u2019s sat on our counter. And I think that\u2019s good, actually? Because they aren\u2019t just plowing through sugar because they feel like they have to finish it, and they know they\u2019ll have other chances to have candy so they don\u2019t go crazy when they get it.", "PRECISELY!! All of this!!\n\nIt was a no win situation and the daughter was well aware of that!! (And Dad just sat there like moron enjoying the back and forth banter, not realizing his daughter was being emotionally and mentally abused \ud83d\ude44)\n\nSomeone else said that OP was likely the wife\u2019s first victim of gaslighting and abuse, and I can see that by how oblivious he is/was. Sadly, my Mom was the exact same way and did the same things to me (and my Dad continues to be oblivious to it).", ">i would however give a bit of a pass to OP as quite often these things are not quite that bad to onlookers unless you\u2019re consciously looking for a pattern of behaviour\n\nJust seconding this a little. My mum was a lot like this, and for a long time I was angry at my dad for letting it happen and, when they separated, not taking me with him to safety, but we had a conversation a little while ago where something he said strongly implied he just didn't know. I went through as much of my memories as I could of my childhood and realised, actually, he mostly wasn't around when the worst stuff happened. He was only there for one or two instances, when he did generally try to pull my mum up on it in a small way, in a tone of surprise. I think to him he didn't realise how constant and consistent and relentless it was, he only got occasional glimpses of my mum slipping up and doing it in front of him, which I think he dismissed as just weird moments or my mum having a bad day or something. He never saw the pattern.\n\nI think therefore my message to OP would be, don't dismiss this as a weird day, please take this seriously.", "Thank you, it was what I meant.", "Least he's questioning enough to post about it. Hopefully he wakes up and gets his daughter away from this monster", "She tried a new taste. She didn't know how she felt about it. Mum decided that she was being deceitful and tried the cigarette punishment. Mum didn't get what she wanted so she decided scorched earth was the method to deal with it. Top shelf parenting that fosters trust and open communication there (sarcasm, incase you can't spot it)\n\nWhat's your problem??", "The only person here with a problem is you. When your kids cut you out of their lives because they resent being bullied and forced to walk on egg shells every minute I hope you at least have enough self awareness to recognize that you brought it on yourself.", "Kids learning to lie is actually an important step in their mental development -- they recognise that there are things that they know that you don't know.\n\nOf course it cannot be encouraged as a strategy -- and mom should have said \"it's bubbly, isn't it? It's okay if you don't like it\". Or if the kid insisted she did, maybe say \"hmm, doesn't seem like it. I'd like some hot chocolate now, want some?\" Instead, she \"playfully\" coerced the kid into drinking all of it and set her up, and felt the need to take her down a peg.\n\nAnd lies about \"when I was big\" aren't lies. She's familiarising herself with the concept of time and life stages, though honestly in my opinion this should have happened around 3, and been over by 5. In any case, this is stupid and infuriating.", "The kid was not lying. She was trying something new and wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about it. It takes children up to 16 tries to get used to a new taste. It sounds like she liked the flavour but didn\u2019t enjoy the fizz, which she probably hasn\u2019t experienced before. It was new so she was figuring it out. The mum was cruel and manipulative.", "If the reminder hurts you then get off the internet and go to therapy. We're literally complaining about people being abusive by forcing you to walk on eggshells and you come here to demand exactly that.\n\nYou're cluelessly proving the expression you hate is perfectly right.", "Right? \n\nThe poor kid probably liked the flavour but didn't enjoy the sensation of the carbonation and didn't know how to express that, especially with her mom pressuring her for a response.", "Someone taking a sip/bite, saying they like it, and not consuming anymore is actually the POLITE way of handling a situation where you actually don't like the thing the other person gave you.\n\nA lot of parents would love for their kid to have this level  of politeness.\n\nAlthough, based on the daughter's reaction, the mom probably often does stuff like this to her, and it's going to effect her mental health.", "As an adult with less self control around food then your kids (in part because of my own childhood stuff), this is great!", "Heck, she may have enjoyed the fizz in the first sip. But the whole can she was forced to drink as an endurance test may have been less enjoyable simply because it was too much. \n\nOr she did like the whole thing, but by the point that mom was grounding her and taking away toys, she realised that her mom would only accept being right, and so she tried to appease her mom by saying what she wanted to hear to get her to stop. (This is the same reason why torture never gets you accurate information...)", "And \"I like it but don't want any more\" is a perfectly valid answer! I too like soda in small doses.\nThe kid tried something new, got to exp\u00e9rience it, and that's great!", "Or she did like it but got the impression that Mommy was mad she liked it.", "And giving a safe space to try new flavours, in a non judgemental way is imperative to NOT giving your child food issues ...", "Yes. \n\nThe kid liked the taste, but didn't like the bubbles.\n\nHis wife ***interrogated*** the kid & the kid only said that she didn't like it so she wouldn't get in trouble.\n\nHe is NTA , his **WIFE** *is a* **BIG YTA**", "She was so polite about it, too. Poor wee thing", "This also too is a perfect jumping off point for future lessons about responsible alcohol drinking, I know it\u2019s a bit of a leap but encouraging that mentality of liking something and being able to put it down (essentially moderation) is so important!", "True. I didn't even think of that aspect. Talk about a kid being set up to fail.", "Yes! That kid did everything right. She was brave enough to try something new, wasn't too sure how she felt about it, and answered with politeness while still asserting her own boundaries. I'd be proud to have such a kid!", "Absolutely!!!", "I mean heck, even before you get to alcohol, just responsible unhealthy food intake. Liking soda but only drinking a bit is a good life lesson, if anything!", "And she's only 5!"]}
