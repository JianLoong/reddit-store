I applaud my daughter every time she tries something new and I don't press her to decide whether she likes it or not. New foods for young kids can take several tries before a kid likes it or ultimately decides they don't. \n\nPlease bring this up to your wife. It's bad to create food anxiety with kids. Don't let her do this. \n\nAlso, setting a kid up to lie is a parent fail. Reassuring your child they don't need to lie because you are safe to be honest with is always better. Punishing lying like that instead of having a discussion about it and letting them know they can trust you with the truth will just make them more wary and feel that you don't understand their feelings.", "That poor baby!

This does not encourage honesty. \n\nA far better response would have been to tell your child that she doesn\u2019t need to tell people what they want to hear and that she has a right to her own feelings. However your wife seems to be overlooking the fact that it is also often appropriate to give responses that may not be 100% honest, but are polite. Sadly I don\u2019t think your wife was actually interested in teaching your daughter. I think she was toying with her emotionally much like a cat toys with a mouse.", "WOW.....\n\nNTA. Although tbh I was pretty concerned when you said your wife was going to make her drink the whole thing...

This is honestly more concerning to me than a lot of what I've read on here. I'm actually quite concerned about the family dynamics. I know, I know, it's hard to know from one anecdote. But it's a bizarre anecdote, and your wife's response is just as upsetting. How your 5 year old daughter is a pathological liar (seriously?!!) and you are a bad parent. She's resorting to gaslighting so fast, and I'm concerned about your girl. She made her drink an entire soda she didn't like (which is like 3 adult sodas) and then still told her \"You were lying!

Would drinking 3 sodas she didn't like be not enough punishment?\n\nEither way, this is NOT healthy, and not how most 5 year olds are raised.\n\nAND 5 year olds tell tales a bit sometimes. It's normal. I still remember, my niece, I guess she was 4, like a year ago, she said her choc cupcake disappeared when we were in the other room. She INSISTED this was true. We asked her how, and finally she said maybe the dog? I asked her if this was true, because if so, it would mean the doggy had to go to the vet tonight and he hates that. She thought for a bit, and said maybe something else happened to it. I asked her if she was sure she hadn't eaten it still, and she said she didn't think so but maybe. If I would have pressed in that directed she would have admitted. I was really proud of her though. I really don't know or care if it was an intentional lie. Making her dog go through something he didn't like was enough to convince her to change her story, even though in her mind it meant not getting another cupcake. I can't remember if she got another cupcake, but we were proud of her for changing her basically surely untrue story for the sake of the dog. Also she had chocolate on her face I believe, and the cupcake wouldn't have seriously harmed the dog, so we weren't risking the dog's life on that. And hey, we exaggerated too about the vet!\n\nLittle kids exaggerate and \"lie.\" I'm still not totally convinced whether they understand they are lying or not, but who cares.\n\nA lie about liking soda pop....

Third, her method is manipulative and abusive:\n\n- she tried to force her to admit to lying on pain of punishment, but the only one that can know if she really does like it or not is the 5 year old!!!

Rather than a valuable moment about trying new things and communicating what we like and don't like your daughter will be scared. \n\nFurthermore, I worry that any \"lying\" with her is a fear on part of your five year old to discuss things with mum that might make her upset. She was trying to impress her mother, try something new and articulate how she feels. Now she is confused that she got stuck in a situation, mum trapped her into communication she does not undersand where now she is in trouble. This is very destructive parenting and your wife needs to seriously re evaluate. \n\nA 5 year old is not a \"liar\". She is developing and scared of mums reactions. Calm, non punative approach needed. \nMum: \"Did you knock that over?\"\nChild: \"NO I didn't\"\n\nOption 1 - Punitive: \"You're a liar and will be punished\" \nOption 2 - Restorative: \"Are you sure it wasent you? I'm sure it wasent on purpose right? You know honey, telling the truth is really important, and if it was an accident then I'm not cross just help me clear it up. If you did knock it over by accident we can clear it up together and maybe think about how to avoid it next time. If it was you and you still say it wasent then maybe you need to go away and think about it and come back to me when you have a different answer. (You have to be SURE it was the kid)\" \n\nOption 1 gives no learning, no chance for repair and remedy. It essentially teaches nothing. \n\nOption 2, the child might lie, might double down on not telling the truth, it may become necessary to use consequence to demonstrate that truth is important. Note, that consequence is different from punishment. A child must logically be able to connect \"I didn't tell the truth for something I should not have done and mum loves me but needs me to know that was not ok\". The point is to try and teach. The child is not labled a \"liar\" but gets taught about the importance of truth in a non confrontational way. \n\nYour wife absolutely did se set your daughter up for failure there. The confusion is completely in keeping with a kid that does not understand the escalation of the situation and the punishment. She accepts but does not understand. This will cause and leave hurt and confusion which is very unhealthy for attachment. As she gets older with a firmer sense of justice parenting such as this will lead her to push against percieved injustice.\n\nI am unsure how you should communicate this to your wife. It is not about \"letting things slide\" but fostering a healthy relationship of logical consequence for the child. This was not logical for your daughter and achieved nothing.

It\u2019s possibly the first time she\u2019s encountered something she kind of liked but kind of didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t figure out how to reconcile the two. And instead of helping her through it, her mom turned her into a liar.", "As a 44 year old woman who has hated carbonation my entire life I can confirm. My mom practically had to force 7Up down me when I had the stomach flu to keep me hydrated because I hated fizzy drinks so much.", "Exactly! Dude, this was such a potentially positive teachable moment and the mom just ruined it. Could have taught the child a lot about trying new things and being honest to yourself/listening to your body. Kid likes the flavor but the bubbles are too much? Soda Streams are like $40 now and even if the tanks cost like $10 to swap, if you just want to make your kid a less-carbonated version of a soda they like, it'll last for ages.", "Especially if she made her drink it down. The longer or more the sensation is on your tongue, the more it would hurt, especially for a kid having it for the first time.", "I like soda, but can\u2019t drink a whole can in one sitting because of the carbonation.  I\u2019m a whole 36 years old.  If I was OP I would\u2019ve knocked that can out of my wife\u2019s hand so fast.  No way anyone would do that to my baby.", "Seriously, child me would have thought I was doing it right by saying something positive but not wanting any more. What a mindfuck.", "I like baked onions, made myself one, and offered my five year old some. He tried a piece, gave me a thumbs up, said it's good, and declined more (little dude just had dinner himself). \n\nAccording to OPs wife I should have forced him to eat my entire onion and then punished him for not giving me an essay on the nuances of the onion to avoid raising a pathological liar \ud83d\ude44 \n\nI'm also dying to know what soda was described as 'spicy'. My children are weird and like spicy chip, but I'd never force them to eat a whole bag of them. This is some kind of warped power play with a literal baby.", "My partner jokes he has to pay a soda tax to me. I don\u2019t want and wouldn\u2019t finish a whole one, but like to have 1-2 sips when he gets one. I can\u2019t even imagine not being willing to let your 5 year old try a sip of soda and decide 1 sip was enough. Depending on how big the soda was that poor kid probably got a tummy ache, 8-12oz of a fizzy drink is a lot.", "This is a good lesson on consent...that her mom totally plowed through.  Good going, mom...", "It's actually a joke in my family because that's essentially what my sister would say when she tried new food that she wasn't keen on.\n\nHow was it? Good.\n\nWould you like so more? No, thank you!", "Yeah. She definitely didn\u2019t dislike it. But you can like something and not want a lot of it. \n\nI like to stretch. It\u2019s a good kind of pain. But if you told me \u201cdid you like stretching your hamstring!? Ok now DO IT FOR AN HOUR!!\u201d You\u2019d be a psychopath", "This is exactly what I was thinking. She was telling the truth about liking it but ended up feeling forced to lie that she didn\u2019t like it. *Great* lesson by OP\u2019s wife.", "But he\u2019ll be a YTA if he doesn\u2019t step for his daughter.  This mother is nuts.", "Heck, not to mention that last bit could be a lie. If I liked something and my mom kept grilling me about it and then grounded me for \"lying,\" I would definitely try to run damage control whatever way I could, probably by mentioning the part that was most odd to me", "Why would she make you drink 7up for the flu if you hated it? There are plenty of ways to make you hydrated that don\u2019t make you more sick. I can\u2019t take alk\u00e1 seltzer. It makes me more nauseated and sometimes puke. I very rarely drink soca because i don\u2019t like the carbonation and if I drank it while ill I would definitely feel worse", "It\u2019s a reasonable leap because the same principles apply. My parents are strict vegetarian, my auntie (technically just moms college friend) said that it wasn\u2019t fair since I never tasted meat, so they gave me cold grilled chicken from a day old salad that was unseasoned to \u201cprove\u201d to her that I didn\u2019t like meat anyway. Well guess what happened when I was 22 and someone gave me some fried bacon for the first time?\n\nThey were similarly strict about soda, alcohol, even eggs. Guess what I never learned how to moderate intake of?", "I suppose she said the soda was spicy because it makes your mouth sting a bit, like some spicy things do?", "Same for me and beer! When my boyfriend gets a beer he pours an espresso cup or shot glass for me. That's enough to get the taste and try new beers! And then I go back to water or squash.", "In our house, we call it a \"no thank you bite\".\n\nYou try one bite and then if you don't like it, you just say \"no, thank you\" and don't have to eat anymore.", "Exactly this! Honestly, I have 5yo twins and it\u2019s a miracle when the boy tries something new. OP has a great little girl, but to me the mother\u2019s behaviour almost borders on abuse. It\u2019s definitely manipulation. All it will do is teach the girl to lie better and be distant from her mother. Hopefully op can keep a better relationship with her.", "Yeah my 3 year old doesn\u2019t like candy \nBut i still let her try mine cause shes curious and maybe she\u2019ll like it! She never does tho lol and i just eat what she doesn\u2019t like. \nThat mom couldve said \u201cthanks for trying something new\u201d and drank her soda instead of forcing her child to drink it all"]}
