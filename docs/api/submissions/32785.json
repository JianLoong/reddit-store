My wife saw my 5yr old daughter eyeing the soda with interest and offered her some with a warning that it was \"spicy\". \n\nMy daughter took a sip of the soda and had a look of uncertainty. My wife then asks \"Did you like it?\" daughter says \"yes\" with the uncertain look continued. \"So finish it\" my wife says as my daughter refuses. My wife follows up with \"Ah, because you didn't like it\". Daughter replies with \"No, I do like it mom. I just dont want anymore\". \"So finish it\". Daughter finishes the drink and goes \"That was yummy mom\" \n\nThis goes on for another 5min of back n forth with my wife trying to get my daughter to admit that she does not like the soda. I sit there enjoying the back n forth banter as it all seems playful. Suddenly, my wife tells my daughter \"No toys, no games, no tablets for lying\" \n\nMy daughter visibly confused and sad says \"Okay mom I just didn't like because it was too bubbly\". Wife says \"too late, nothing for the rest of the night. Get ready for bed\". I sat there in confusion due to the playful nature suddenly becoming a lesson about lying. I mentioned that our daughter just wanted to impress her by drinking an \"adult\" drink and wasn't about deceiving her. I was then accused of just allowing my daughter to walk all over us and play us like we're idiots. \n\nMy wife had made up her mind that my 5yr old daughter is a pathological liar because of this and other light lying examples children do regularly (i.e, That wasn't me who knocked that over,  I dont remember you saying that, when I was big... etc.) \n\nI mentioned that she set my daughter up and it wasn't taken kindly. She then began putting down my abilities as a parent and to wait when she's a teenager and lies about much more serious things and she's gonna get away with it because I don't question her. I felt like this was blown way out of proportion and she stormed out into our office as she says \"I guess I'm the only parent here! Keep letting her slide you'll see!\" \n\nAnyways AITA?", "created_utc": 1702270447, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fmnvt/aita_for_not_agreeing_with_my_wifes_form_of_a/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Setting kids up with manipulative questions like that is surefire way for them to develop anxiety when they get older. *\"Do I really feel this way?\" \"Am I just lying to myself.\" \"I should just stick with what I know I like.\"* This type of parenting is going to make her a nervous wreck who can't trust her own judgement.", "NTA. Da fuk? That\u2019s a pretty extreme over reaction on her part. Besides, it sounded less like your daughter was lying, and more like she was just trying to be polite. It\u2019s silly of your wife to get so upset over this.", "NTA!! Your wife seems to be taking a little thing extremely seriously and blowing it out of proportion. I agree stick up for your kid always!", "NTA your wife is manipulative, trapped her kid and abused her mentally.", "NTA, has your wife ever heard of the word Entrapment? It was a drink for the love of god here.", "NTA\n\nIf you let her continue to pull this gaslighting, abusive crap on your kid, however, you will be an asshole.  So do not let this continue.", "NTA. It\u2019s strange wife has a grudge with a baby", "Your daughter is only learning to say what mom wants to hear whether it\u2019s the truth or not. Your wife is setting your daughter for failure. Your wife is the AH, playing kind games with a small child.", "NTA. Your wife did an awful thing: she made a new experience into a trap for a 5-year-old child. \n\nLook, your daughter wasn't lying. She was trying to decide what she thought about a new taste. She might have liked the sweetness, but not so sure what she thought about the carbonation. \n\nSo... great way to make her reluctant to try any new foods or drinks, mom. I applaud my daughter every time she tries something new and I don't press her to decide whether she likes it or not. New foods for young kids can take several tries before a kid likes it or ultimately decides they don't. \n\nPlease bring this up to your wife. It's bad to create food anxiety with kids. Don't let her do this. \n\nAlso, setting a kid up to lie is a parent fail. Reassuring your child they don't need to lie because you are safe to be honest with is always better. Punishing lying like that instead of having a discussion about it and letting them know they can trust you with the truth will just make them more wary and feel that you don't understand their feelings.", "That poor baby! I would question why your wife needs to exert her dominance over something like this. Please look out for your little girl!", "NTA - This is abusive behavior on you wife\u2019s part though (both to your daughter and YOU). Don\u2019t let her get away with it or your daughter will absolutely grow up to have anxiety (or worse) and you will start to lose confidence in yourself as a parent. A parent protects their child\u2026.even if that means sometimes it\u2019s from the other parent. And -btw- abusing your child now will in no way prevent her from lying to you when she\u2019s a teenager, so you should also nip that falsehood in the bud. If she lies about something serious when she\u2019s a teenager, you\u2019ll deal with it then.", "Info: what is wrong with your wife?", "NTA and your wife sounds like she needs parental coaching before your daughter hates her.", "NTA\n\nyour poor daughter must be so confused.\n\nYour wife is a massive AH, she set your daughter up and then punished her.

Your daughter is just going to learn to be a better liar when she gets older.", "NTA! That is some strange behaviour from your wife though.", "NTA WTAF This is not normal behavior. What your wife did is wrong on so many levels. I would be concerned about what goes on when you\u2019re not around. Do not let your wife\u2019s behavior continue. She needs therapy.", "NTA. Your wife needs to read a book or two about psychological development in children. Kids lie. It\u2019s normal and harmless, especially at age 5.", "NTA for sticking up for your kid, because yeah, making her finish a soda she didn't like is enough punishment the rest is overkill.", "INFO: Is your wife your kid's bio-mom? You keep referring to your daughter as \"my daughter\" and \"my 5 year old\" and not \"our daughter.\" If she isn't and she keeps doing this kind of shit consider if you want her in your daughter's life.\n\nNTA", "Info: is your wife pregnant?

It almost sounds as if your wife is mentally ill and incredibly abusive. I would be afraid to leave my daughter alone with her. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you think it was playful or all in good fun at first, because it reads like you should have intervened from the start. Your daughter is only five years old. This is so disturbing that I really think you and your daughter should move out and get away from this woman.", "NTA. Your wife was bullying your small child.", "Nta.\n\nYour wife sucks as a mother jesus.", "NTA. That was unhinged. Your poor daughter. Don\u2019t let that become a pattern for her to have to deal with.  It will mess her up.", "NTA your wife is acting like a psycho!", "My mom used to do this to me when I was kid. Now I just don't interact with her :) because I rather not end thinking \"Is this right?\" \"Will she believe me?\" \"Is she going to do something if she thinks I'm wrong/lying?\"\n\nI don't trust my mom because she pulled shit like this.\n\nNTA btw. Just know your wife probably won't have a real relationship with your daughter.", "NTA and a weird interaction on your wife's part. This interaction certainly isn't going to \"teach\" your daughter to not lie.  It is more likely going to teach her to tell her mom what she wants to hear.   Randomly, a million years ago, when I was about five, I wanted to try my mom's soda.  She let me and I said it was \"hot\".  She and her friend laughed and didn't make me drink anymore or admit to liking or not liking it.", "I went through this with my ex. This is one of the many reasons I left.\n\n I'm not up for mind games ESPECIALLY when it's an adult \"testing\" a CHILD for Gods sake. \n\nHe always justified it with what he did as a child and how he lied and snuck behind his mom's back at a young age and I just \"watch and see\" that my son's gonna be the same way if we don't stay on his neck now.\n\nMy son is 5 btw and my ex has been in his life  since before he was 2. He's a pretty well behaved kid and usually does things the first time asked (picking up toys, or clearing his spot after he eats, helping with his brother, etc ) , but my ex would also say that \"8 out 10 times is not enough. He needs to do it the first time 10 out of 10 times\". \n\nI'm getting angry just thinking about it. \n\nI tried to reason over and over and fought him on it EVERY SINGLE TIME to the point of me crying. My son was regrettably a witness to these fights. But it never changed. \n\nHe still did it- and even still tries when he comes around for my younger son,  but he has no power here. \n\nNot anymore.", "This is not tame at all.\n\nNTA what your wife did is horrid. She's teaching your daughter that being gaslit is normal and to accept someone forcing an opinion on her.\n\nThis was no playful banter. You've far bigger problems at home. Get into counseling. Separate counseling than your wife.\n\nKeep standing up for your little girl.", "NTA but at least it's not the end of the world. Your daughter is going to be fine. I hope your wife rethinks her parenting techniques. In her defense, lying is a slippery slope and nowadays there are so many messed up kids like school shooters and drug addicts. She's just being overprotective. Maybe show her some AITA posts from parents who were deemed assholes because they treated their kids like her. This is fixable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
