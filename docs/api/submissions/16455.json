Because of a previously failed LDR, I said from the very beginning that I didn't want to be in one again. But then COVID rolled around, and we were living in the same city for a bit and I fell for him and got myself into another long distance relationship. When our office reopened and I moved back home 1100+ miles away, we agreed to see each other once a month, alternating locations. We have been good about keeping this schedule, but there is the occasional month where I'll go and visit him instead of him coming to me. Whoever is visiting pays for their own flights, and the person hosting covers dinners and activities. I feel that it has been a fair arrangement, as we both have full-time jobs and make decent money. However, I am much better at money management and saving than he is, so he often finds himself stressing about funds, but still buying unnecessary* stuff and making poor financial choices. It's stresses me out to no end, and he knows this and is trying to be better.\n\nI recently received a raise at work and was super excited about it, given that life in general has been getting much more expensive. When I told Jay about my raise, his first reaction was to ask me to start paying for his flights to see me, as well as continuing to pay for mine to see him. I reminded him that's not the arrangement we had, and that my life style does not change with this raise. I just plan on putting more into my savings. He seemed really upset by this answer. I said that I don't think it's fair that I have to pay for everything just because he chooses to spend his money on unnecessary things. He says that I am well off and since I won't pay for his ticket, it makes him feel like I don't want to see him. I do want to see him, I just feel it's not my responsibility to support him financially, and if I do it will enable his current spending habits. He said it is incredibly selfish of me to think this way and I understand where he's coming from, but I just don't agree.\n\nSo am I the asshole or selfish for refusing to pay for his flights to visit me?\n\n\n*Unnecessary stuff: he enjoys collecting a certain type of liquor that can be hundreds of dollars per bottle, making modifications to his car, and other pretty expensive hobbies", "created_utc": 1683301585, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138sndk/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_boyfriends/", "score": 522, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because you are earning more, doesn't mean you should pay for everything. First off, he is just your bf and not your husband. What would happen when you guys got married? He'll make you pay for everything because you make more?\n\nAnd just like every couple, there are agreements to make the relationship work. Relationship should be balance; it's give and take. Don't be in a relationship if you are not willing to make sacrifices and compromise.\n\nI hope he change, because if he continues to not be willing to exert an effort - then the relationship is going downhill.

He should be over the moon and ecstatic for your raise because he loves you and should want the best for you, not because it means he can now stop spending so much on you. LDR are difficult in so many ways, but fundamentally you need to have an unselfish love, respect, absolute trust, and a willingness to go above and beyond for your SO. It does not sound like he is as invested in the hardships seeing you in person entails which makes me wonder what other areas of your relationship will he get tired of putting effort into down the line. I suggest a serious conversation where you discuss exactly what his request tells you when reading between the lines, and ask him directly if he is truly as committed to your relationship as he used to be.

Basically I was left worrying every month and working as much as I could just to afford the basics for our family and it turned out he hid the amount he made and wasted thousands a month. All whilst I stressed just to maintain supply the basics for us to live. That he had savings and money plenty of time but told me he was broke and couldn\u2019t get the kids new shoes they urgently needed or Christmas presents for them. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I was stuck having to pay chunks of his debts because he had to get anything he saw whilst hiding them from me.I also suggest from now on do not share anything about how much you earn, any savings you get or any raises. I\u2019d wait a couple of months then tell him your company started to struggle and that day they told you they couldn\u2019t pay the higher amount any more.

Or at least is very comfortable making it your responsibility that he gets there. \nThe way he spends his money, versus the way you spend yours, are totally different. Which is fine as long as it's not on your (or your partners) expense. \n\nIf his spending/hobbies make it so that you would have to spend more so he can see you, is a bit cringe. \n*His hobbies should not affect your life.*\n\nIf he wants to blame someone, he should blame himself. \nIf he finds his finances are none of your business, then thats his rightful boundary, but also not your problem. \n\nIf he wants to see you and he wants expensive things, he'll have to do what a lot of people these days have to do, and just wait until next paycheck comes along.", "NTA. \n\nYou're the sugar mama and he's the entitled boy who likes his toys and being taken care of, sounds like.", "NTA, but every month is a lot.

If liquor and cars are more important than being able to afford a flight to come visit, then you know where you stand.

I think you have made your expectations clear and discussed them in a positive way that makes sense. You are communicating very maturely, on the other hand, he wants you to foot the bill (and for what?). You do want to see him, but it is not fair that the financial burden of the relationship would be solely on you. This could add up to thousands of dollars in a calendar year. What is he willing to do to meet you halfway here? Is there a longer term plan for him to relocate to you? \n\nUltimately, if he is not willing to add these trips into his spending budget, your financial goals are not aligned.

What happens when you actually share funds? Is he willing to give you control and live on spending money you ration out or will you two live separate financial lives along each other? \nWhich will likely lead to your money going into necessities and upkeep and his getting blown on every fancy he comes across.\n\nLast he turns around and tries to guilt trip you into enabling his spending instead of 'trying to be better' as he promised.\n\nIf you want to persue the relationship regardless. Draw a hard line, lay this out to him and see how he reacts, maybe he sobers up and actually tries harder.\nBut be prepared to have to repeat it several times with varying issues.", "NTA At All\n\nHe's trying to manipulate you by saying you should pay because He Feels like you don't want to see him because you have the money to pay for both trips but won't.\n\nHe is the one who chose not to budget.\n\nYou both agreed to the way things were.\n\nIf he's mad you are making more, maybe he should find another source of income or be more responsible.\n\nBut none of that is on You to handle or fix.
