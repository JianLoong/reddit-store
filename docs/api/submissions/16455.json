Because of a previously failed LDR, I said from the very beginning that I didn't want to be in one again. But then COVID rolled around, and we were living in the same city for a bit and I fell for him and got myself into another long distance relationship. When our office reopened and I moved back home 1100+ miles away, we agreed to see each other once a month, alternating locations. We have been good about keeping this schedule, but there is the occasional month where I'll go and visit him instead of him coming to me. Whoever is visiting pays for their own flights, and the person hosting covers dinners and activities. I feel that it has been a fair arrangement, as we both have full-time jobs and make decent money. However, I am much better at money management and saving than he is, so he often finds himself stressing about funds, but still buying unnecessary* stuff and making poor financial choices. It's stresses me out to no end, and he knows this and is trying to be better.\n\nI recently received a raise at work and was super excited about it, given that life in general has been getting much more expensive. When I told Jay about my raise, his first reaction was to ask me to start paying for his flights to see me, as well as continuing to pay for mine to see him. I reminded him that's not the arrangement we had, and that my life style does not change with this raise. I just plan on putting more into my savings. He seemed really upset by this answer. I said that I don't think it's fair that I have to pay for everything just because he chooses to spend his money on unnecessary things. He says that I am well off and since I won't pay for his ticket, it makes him feel like I don't want to see him. I do want to see him, I just feel it's not my responsibility to support him financially, and if I do it will enable his current spending habits. He said it is incredibly selfish of me to think this way and I understand where he's coming from, but I just don't agree.\n\nSo am I the asshole or selfish for refusing to pay for his flights to visit me?\n\n\n*Unnecessary stuff: he enjoys collecting a certain type of liquor that can be hundreds of dollars per bottle, making modifications to his car, and other pretty expensive hobbies", "created_utc": 1683301585, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138sndk/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_boyfriends/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Both of you had an agreement, which seems perfectly reasonable. \nHonestly, do you want to be in a relationship with him? He\u2019s financially irresponsible and not willing to change.

He\u2019s pretty entitled to think you should be covering for his bad financial habits. At best, maybe pay for a session with a financial planner for him.  In that way he will save so much money he can take his flights out of that.", "NTA. It's reasonable for each of you to pay for your own travel. You do not need to subsidize his expensive hobbies.\n\nYour approaches to finances represent a pretty major incompatibility. Even if you're otherwise happy right now, this does not look built for the long term.", "NTA. Find a Local.", "NTA, add this to the laundry list of reasons LDRs don\u2019t work long term. \n\nIn my humble opinion the only way for a long distance relationship to work is if you are both working towards making it a short distance relationship asap", "NTA\n\nHe's not entitled to your money and he's demonstrating that you are not a priority to him if he's not putting aside money for when it's his turn to travel.", "Independence, financial and otherwise, is sexy. Being unable to handle your shit so you can see your partner? Deeply unsexy. NTA.", "NTA.....Id rethink the relationship in general if he's trying to guilt you into footing the bill for everything. Just because you got a raise,(amount is irrelevant) doesn't mean you should take on the financial burden of his transportation. His implying that you should just makes me think he sees you as a future source of income while he continues to be irresponsible with his own finances", "NTA. He\u2019s a grown man. He can pay for his own flights. By him suggesting you start paying it shows exactly how he sees you - you just know you\u2019d be footing the bill for all the dinners and activities too. You told him point blank you didn\u2019t want to be in another LDR, and something tells me you should end it now before he starts telling you he can no longer travel to you.", "I'd break up with him. You shouldn't be paying for his flights. He's not broke, he's buying $$$ alcohol and other expensive stuff. It's a poor sign when you get a raise and he wants to spend it. You're also not compatible long term because you save your money and he blows his.", "NTA - He's entitled", "Nta and get rid", "NTA\n\n\"It makes him feel like I don't want to see him\"\n\nLike maybe how it would make you feel when he chooses to buy things instead of putting the money aside to come see you? You're doing your share and paying to come see him. He is not putting in the effort to do the same and now asking you to go above and beyond and put in the effort for him. Not acceptable in the slightest.", "NTA. Both you and he can spend your money how each of you wants. In his case, buying expensive liquor and zhuzhing up his car are more important than spending money on visiting you. I think you can draw your own conclusions on how important you are to him.", "Is sex with him good enough that you are willing to have him be your gigolo?

Asking you to pay for his flights is ridiculous!", "NTA - If he wants a LDR but can't handle one, then you or he can leave the LDR.", "NTA. Not your fault he's bad with money.", "NTA, you could easily use his manipulation tactic against him. After all, how bad can he want to see YOU if he isn\u2019t willing to curb his spending to make it happen?", "NTA. He is spending his money on his top priorities. You appear to not be one of them. I\u2019d move on if I were you.", "NTA.

He knows you want to see him, so he's trying to guilt you into paying", "So...your boyfriend is prioritizing his liquor collection over visiting you.  What part of this is unclear exactly?\n\nNTA.", "I wouldnt pay for him and this doesnt feel like its working out", "NTA. Use this info to access if this is really the right relationship for you, especially if you are thinking of a future with him. Your financial habits are different and money is right up there for top reasons couples fight & divorce.", "NTA. If he wanted to see you, he\u2019d stop buying unnecessary shit, or at least less of it. You are not obligated to foot the bill for this relationship. I would personally tell him to figure it out or fuck off, but it\u2019s up to you to decide how to handle it.", "NTA he seems to be selfish and just cares about himself. If he's truly serious about the relationship, he would set aside the material things or other stuff, and prioritize you.\n\nI'm not saying he shouldn't buy himself things that would make him happy, but it should be balance. He should save money for a plane ticket if he truly wants to be with you. That's how you'll know you are important to someone, when they make sacrifices and *efforts.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He says that I am well off and since I won't pay for his ticket, it makes him feel like I don't want to see him\n\nThat is not a fair statement, more like seeing you is not his priority because he doesn't want to spend money on you. Just because you are earning more, doesn't mean you should pay for everything. First off, he is just your bf and not your husband. What would happen when you guys got married? He'll make you pay for everything because you make more?\n\nAnd just like every couple, there are agreements to make the relationship work. Relationship should be balance; it's give and take. Don't be in a relationship if you are not willing to make sacrifices and compromise.\n\nI hope he change, because if he continues to not be willing to exert an effort - then the relationship is going downhill. It's not fair that it's just you who's willing to spend the money, \n\nI have been in a long distance relationship myself- different country. It's not easy, but it's worth it with the right person..", "NTA - You aren't his sugar MoMA.", "NTA, me and my partner share expenses and I still wouldn't ask/expect them to begin giving more because they got a raise, especially not if you're not living together.", "NTA and congrats on your raise.", "NTA - You don't owe anyone else any money just because you have it.  Having said that, he also doesn't owe you an explanation for what he spends his money on either.  He does need to take on the responsibility to pay his own way.  After that, he can spend his money any way he chooses.", "NTA", "NTA", "I think this highlights that you aren't compatible. NTA", "NTA - Sounds like he wants to be your call boy or sugar baby?
