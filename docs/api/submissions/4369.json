She should just be happy no one has packed all of that crap in trash bags and taken it to the dumpster yet.", "NTA\n\nHer own fault for using a parking spot as a storage space. She knew the risks and she still did it.\n\nYou can tell her that she owes you $15 per each month that she used your space as part of her storage space. LoL.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s really lucky none of her son\u2019s stuff has been stolen.  Hockey gear is expensive, especially goalie gear.  If she wants her son\u2019s equipment to be safe, where it won\u2019t be stolen or damaged, she is responsible for storing it somewhere safe.", "NTA. NT fucking A.\n\nShe needs to sort her shit.", "NTA. Bah, it's her fault, and she has no right to put things in a way that makes your access to your own parking space difficult or inconvenience you.", "NTA. She's the one storing things improperly. You don't have to be rude about your refusal, but ultimately, improper storage is what caused the issue and anyone with access to the garage could have moved it.", "Mom of 3 goalies and wtf NTA. Goalie gear is incredibly expensive. My kids helmets are 1k each. Why in the heck would she leave it sitting out in a parking garage to get stolen or destroyed??? Also, it stinks, totally rude of her to subject the rest of the parking garage to that smell.", "NTA- tell her- stop blaming others because you don't secure your property in your space or use a locker. \n\nI'll be happy to pay for your helmet and you can pay me a $20 fee for each time I've had to move your stuff to get in or out of my space.  Wonder which one of us owes more?", "NTA seems to me if she just rented the locker instead she wouldn't have to store the equipment in the parking lot?

And you aren't responsible for her belongings in any way.", "NTA. Also, \"LOL, F off lady\" would be absolutely okay for her demands. You should report her to the landlord before she starts making unfounded accusations.

They required me to do a documented walk-around (check for dents, damage, clear from clutter around) every single time I had to drive a company vehicle. I still do it when I park in certain areas so I don't damage my vehicle.", "NTA.\nAlso the items are a trip hazard from a safety perspective (incase they say the items aren't combustible), so potential suing for medical bills.", "NTA.
