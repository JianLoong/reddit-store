I was asked to be maid of honor and her best friend matron of honor. We planned the parties together. After the engagement party. We started planning a Caribbean bachelorette party(we live in the u.s). But due to the pandemic this trip got canceled. She and her now husband pivoted and opted for a small wedding (30 guests). Instead we planned an old school bachelorette sleepover. \n\nWe talked about taking a \u201cgirls trip\u201d together in the future and finally planned one this spring break. We have a group of 8, 5 of my sisters friends and my best friend. The trip is in one week and my sister is no longer able to go due to a family (husbands side) emergency. I feel terrible that she can\u2019t make this trip as does the rest of the group. But everything is booked and paid for, we are excited, so we decided to still go. My sister told the group she understood and wished us a good trip. \n\nYet, she has been harassing me nonstop about going. She literally told me if the situation was reversed she would stay behind in case I needed her emotionally. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she had our mom talk to me about it. My mom keeps calling it my sister\u2019s \u201cbachelorette party\u201d. Though she is already married! Asking me to question if I am being insensitive. There are many people going on this trip, but somehow I\u2019m the only bad guy.?!?!

This is NOT her bachelorette.", "NTA she can't really expect you to not go and lose the money. She's salty she's missing out, and that's understandable. But still unreasonable. You're the bad guy to her tho bc you're her sister. She holds you to a higher standard.", "NTA. She's upset about her emergency and missing the trip, and taking it out on you.", "Very misleading title in my opinion but NTA\n\nIt just a girls trip, an expensive girls trip but nothing more. If someone gets sick or in her case has other obligations, tough luck life happens.", "NTA. This really isn't a bachelorette party anymore. It's a girl's trip which is booked and paid for. I don't really know what your dynamic is like with your sister but it certainly sounds to me like she's asking a lot by having you forfeit your entire week on the offchance that she might need support.", "NTA.  The situation sucks but you've all long-ago made your plans and taken off work, etc.  Go, have fun and tell your sister you will absolutely do another trip with her for a post-bachelorette celebration and it will be even better.  Tell your mom to stop calling it that and impress on her how much money everyone has already spent, etc.", "Nta. Your sister is pissed she can\u2019t go and is taking it out on you.", "NTA - She just wants you to stay because she can\u2019t go. That\u2019s super selfish of her and manipulating your parents to also shame you into staying is terrible. Go have fun!", "  NTA. Your sister is upset that she can't go\\~but with this death in her husband's family, she can't go on this trip.\n\n  It is reasonable that she is staying home; NOT reasonable to get mad at you. She's zeroing on you b/c you are her sister; if she rants at the friends, they may un-friend her.  \n\n   Go on the trip, and hopefully\\~she will eventually stop resenting that she had to miss it.", "NTA,\n\nWhy would your sister expect you (and 6 other people) to just cancel a trip , one week out? It's paid for, it's planned  , and vacation time has already been submitted and approved. \n\nAlso, how on Earth would you be required to stay behind in case she needs you for emotional support, when you've said she never met the uncle that passed....It sounds like she chose to stay behind for her husband so that she could offer emotional support for him. \n\nShe's probably super bummed about missing the trip, and was likely really excited and looking forward to it. I bet she's having a major case of FOMO, and because you're her sister, she feels she can ask you to stay behind and make an unrealistic request of you because you're family.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and go on the trip. Explain to your sister why it doesn't make sense for you to cancel & You're really sorry that life got in the way for her. She already had her wedding and Bachelorette party, and isn't \"missing out\" on that experience. \n\nYour sister is the AH for trying to guilt you into staying back, just so she isn't the only one who gets the short straw. GO on the trip. Have fun! She will forgive you I'm sure", ">She literally told me if the situation was reversed she would stay behind in case I needed her emotionally.\n\nI doubt it and she's an adult, she can handle it. NTA. Enjoy your trip. If your sister needs emotional support, she can call your mom. \n\n>It\u2019s gotten so bad that she had our mom talk to me about it.\n\nAdult siblings need to stop running to their parents over minor sibling disputes or they are automatically the AH.", "NTA. Shit happens.", "NTA. The trip is paid for.  Unless your sister is offering to cover your losses, and even then, go have fun.\n\nIf it matters that much to your mom, ask her (your mom) to offer to become your sister's emotional support while you're gone.", "NTA. Go and have fun. If she keeps harassing you block her.", "NTA- Sounds like your sister need to get a grip", "NTA, although I do wonder what the emergency is.\n\nIs something happening to her MIL or FIL that she needs to emotionally support her husband and need someone to help her be supported? I would miss my in-laws terribly and would need some support but would want to avoid dumping that on my partner, so I'd want to lean on a close friend or sibling if that's the case.\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't want my money to be wasted either and looking forward to the trip would be hard to change that up without good reasoning.\n\nIn the end, NTA.", "NTA but there should be a rule about not using baity misleading titles on posts.", "NTA....go and have a good time.

And even tho in my eyes (and many others) this isn\u2019t her bachelorette i sincerely believe she thinks of this trip this way.

If your sister gets mad let her and she will eventually get over it.", "NTA.  Tell your parents to butt out and quit encouraging her entitlement.  She is married, so it has nothing to do with her wedding.  Her emergency while sad, does not mean everyone else can\u2019t go.  Crap happens.

I can see her pov too. She\u2019s been wanting to do this trip for 3 or 4 years. Now everyone is going without her and probably won\u2019t want to make the same trip again. If it weren\u2019t for her, this trip wouldn\u2019t even be happening. So, yeah, she\u2019s disappointed.  But I can see where the rest of you don\u2019t want to cancel and idk why you\u2019re the one she\u2019s giving a hard time about it.

She's pulling the poor me card. And now your getting all of her anger.  It's understandable for her to be upset that she couldn't go, but to expect everyone else to cancel the trip after it's booked & paid for is completely an unreasonable request.  She's not being fair to you or to the rest of her bridal party.", "LMAO she had to go tattle to mommy that her little sister gets to do something she can't!
