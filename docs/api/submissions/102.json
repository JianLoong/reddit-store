Your wife should just accept responsibility for what she did, along with the consequence.", "NTA.

Saving lives.", "NTA. Your wife really doesn't understand how serious what she did was, and seemingly won't, until, heaven forbid, she sees herself in an incident involving mobiles and driving. I see it every time I go out into the street: pedestrians looking so intently at their screens that they don't notice when the light goes from green to red, drivers so absorbed in their conversations while holding their phones in one hand (Why do they do that? Are they so damn cheap they cannot even get themselves a hands-free device?) that they don't notice they have gone from one side of the road to the other, drivers texting as if they were solving all the problems in the world while other drivers honk at them because they are crossing lanes and simply are not paying attention to what they're doing...

But how could she not? I mean, doesn't she know about your accident? \n\n NTA-- you didn't know the footage would incriminate your wife when you gave it up. And, to be honest, if you are actually committed to the cause, you probably should have turned it over anyway even if you knew.", "NTA don't text and drive!", "INFO: was she on private property", "NTA. Thank you! People that break the law deserve to suffer the consequences.", "Clarifying question: Why in the world would you turn her in... and then pay the fine FOR her? That is the opposite of her having consequences for her actions that could have killed someone. \n\nSo if you aren't doing this for her to learn her actions have consequences, are you just using it as a gotcha?

Where I live in it seems like everyone texts and drives, it's horrific. On a daily basis I see lorry drivers speeding through town texting or talking, paying no attention to the road.
