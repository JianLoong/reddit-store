She generated art using AI and sold them", "selftext": "Hi there, I'm 19F and my sister Lauren is 17F. \n\nBackground: For the past 6 months, I've been donating $100 to a non-profit charity every month. Unfortunately, I was fired from my job recently, leaving me with too little to continue my donations. \n\nHowever, 2 months ago, I came up with the idea of raising funds by selling printed T-shirts and cups. I drew out the designs and sold them on Redbubble, with all my profits going towards my favourite charity. So far, I've only earnt $30 but it's better than nothing.\n\nA month ago, Lauren decided to copy me. She opened a Redbubble account and excitedly told me that she would be selling tees for charity too. I was skeptical as she did not draw at all (and wasn't interested in it), but tried to be as supportive as I could - giving her advice and telling her how the website works, etc. \n\nWhen she first showed me her product designs, I was stunned. They were intimidatingly good - really great art with HD quality. Amazed, I asked her \"Have you been working on your art secretly?\". To my surprise, she started laughing, then said - \"I may or may not have...*generated this using AI!*\"\n\nI was totally horrified, especially as an artist myself. I told her that AI devalues art made by real humans. Selling things with generated art is essentially cheating. Lauren rolled her eyes and said, \"It's for a good cause\". I tried to convince her to not do it, but she didn't listen. \n\nFast forward to yesterday. Lauren's Redbubble shop has become really successful. She has earnt nearly $400 - which is no surprise at all because AI art is so *professional*. I'm not going to lie: I am bitter that she stole my idea then got successful without putting in a single drop of effort.\n\nAt lunch, she triumphantly announced that she had reached 50 orders. My mom and dad were so proud of her and even suggested we go out for a fancy dinner as a celebration (which they never do). \n\nI couldn't help but say - \"Mom, you should treat the AI to dinner, not Lauren.\" Lauren laughed and said - \"Why are you still mad about that?\"\n\nI replied \"I'm not mad with you, I'm just upset that you are selling AI-generated art under YOUR name. It's cheating!\" \n\nSuddenly, Lauren blew up. \"It's not cheating! I'm tired of you shitting on my success. You have no reason to be mad - I'm not pocketing the money. I'm donating it.\"\n\nI told her, donated or not, it was still unethical. She yelled angrily \"Do you even care about the charity? Or do you just like feeling good about yourself?\" \n\nI was really hurt by her statements. Firstly, I did NOT shit on her success. I was the one who gave her advice on how to even start her business! Secondly, *I* was the one who donated $100 every month out of my pathetic student money. She just jumped on the bandwagon. \n\nUpset and angry, I left to my room. Lauren went to stay at her boyfriend's place - I haven't heard from her ever since the argument. I don't really feel bad (after all that she said about me!) but my mom says that I was too harsh on her. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676129857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zq3bf/aita_for_slamming_my_sister_she_generated_art/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

AI art is more than cheating, it's theft. The program can't create on its own but uses human made art stolen from the artists. All without permission. If it was solely public domain art, this would be different. But AI uses copyrighted artwork without permission or compensation. Anyone who uses it for commercial purposes is a thief", "NTA and anyone who says otherwise doesn't know how AI art works. Your sister is stealing from artists to generate images and is profiting off them. Even if she's donating to charity, she is stealing from artists to do it. It is extremely unethical and you have every right to criticize her.", "This isn't about her success it is about AI generated art. She is stealing from other ACTUAL artists, passing the work off as her own and then selling it. that's awful, and the implications it has for skilled artists today are terrifying.

AI also steals the artwork from several different artists to create a \u201cstyle\u201d. The worst part about your story is that your sister is claiming the art is her own, and selling it as her own, even if it\u2019s for a good cause she\u2019s lying. Now if on her page she were to say artwork created by AI for a good cause then she would be ok. But if you\u2019re raising funds for a charity the last thing you want to do is be shady about your work. It sucks for you to watch this go down but believe me karma comes back around. Do your parents know how AI art is created? They may feel differently if they knew. I\u2019d leave it alone honestly because she\u2019s not going to come clean about her work but NTA for trying.", "NTA. Tbh I wouldn't ask the opinion of that up here purely because so many people undervalue art as a whole. They don't get how time consuming creating things is. They don't value the effort put in education wise either. And because people don't care about ethical practices in MOST situations, the thing people are going to nitpick at the most is how you delivered your message. \n\nYeah it sounded like there was a little venom in it, but it felt like it was more of the fact that she's being celebrated for something she didn't really put much effort/time in and you want some recognition as well. Which tbh, you should get.\n\nTl;dr: Ai \"art\" is theft. And if she's not clear about mentioning that it's Ai designed t-shirts, that's a double whammy.", "Unpopular opinion but  NTA. AI art is unethical.", "NTA - AI draws from other people's REAL art, sometimes you even see the original artist's signature in the piece. It's one thing to create for fun but selling it is absolutely unethical.\n\nEdit: typo", "I guess it depends. As an artist, I\u2019m not against AI being used, *depending* on how it is used. If it\u2019s just completely generated with no input from the artist, such as using your own work, and sold as though you created it, then yeah, I\u2019d call an \u201cartist\u201d out on that, because they aren\u2019t an artist. It\u2019s the principle of the matter.\n\nSo, if she isn\u2019t doing anything other than generating random images and claiming it as her art, then yeah, NTA. It is unethical, especially since those AIs have been found to source other artists\u2019 work.", "Going with NTA but there are better reasons to be against this than your own ego.\n\nSelling AI art is unethical largely because it works through stealing other people's art. Your sister is probably selling loads of designs that are just other people's works obviously crushed into one big image. (When people find the original art that AI \"references,\" it's really obvious what's happening and honestly makes AI seem a lot less impressive).\n\nThis is basically theft and could get your sister into a lot of legal issues if she's making that much profit from it.\n\nIt's also just generally shitty to build an online personality around selling art you didn't make. People buy stuff on Redbubble largely to support artists that make things they enjoy. This is lying to everyone about the product she's selling. It's also probably against the ToS of basically every reputable site you can sell art on.\n\nWith that said, I think this level of competition between you two is indicative of bigger issues. How often are you pitted against each other, and how often does one feel like they're the \"golden child\" of the family while the other feels like all their accomplishments are neglected?", "NTA\n\nAI generated art isn\u2019t art and anyone that passes it off as such should be ashamed", "YTA.

Or is it to feed your ego? YTA.", "EHS except mom. Mom is right, you were too harsh. There\u2019s no problem selling AI art but claiming it as original sucks.

You're salty AF that she's been more successful at this t-shirt game than you.\n\nIdk how you generate art via AI (because I'm a dinosaur)... but she's not selling million dollar paintings and claiming they are hand painted. She's designing a t-shirt. Many people use computer programs to generate designs/graphic art in their heads.", "Yeah, I\u2019m going to go with YTA on this one. The core issue at hand here is the debate over AI generated art, which I find not terribly dissimilar to the debate over music artists sampling from others\u2019 work. AI can\u2019t make art without sampling from human artists, which can understandably make \u2018real\u2019 artists feel both threatened and exploited. But can you honestly say that anybody is being harmed here, aside from your ego?", "The artist directs the AI to create the image after the artist\u2019s fantasy.

For that YTA", "YTA, jealousy pure and simple.  Your not the guardian of what is art or who is an artist.  Your sister would be copying you if she sold the SAME T-shirts and cups you did.  Apparently she has found a niche of what people want, more so than you.  In return you become bitter and jealous.", "AI debate aside, YTA here. You seem to have a bit of self-reflecting to do. Your jealousy is only bringing you down.", "YTA. Your jealous and took it out on her. I understand being jealous in this situation but, that's on you and you shouldn't lash out on others who are excited about their success. It is for a good cause, you are both donating the money and that's awesome. I think you owe her an apology.", "This is gonna be one of those things people laugh at in a few years. AI is going to overtake multiple aspects of our lives in the coming future; we need to figure out how to adapt. AI isn\u2019t going away. YTA you\u2019re living in the past.", "YTA. I don\u2019t feel like this is cheating. She still came up with the idea to use AI. Either way, welcome to the future. People will use AI to simplify tasks, even if it\u2019s considered \u201ccheating\u201d, like why write a paper of you don\u2019t have to, why draw if you have no interest in it?", "ESH\n\nYour sister copied your idea, I have 3 sisters and I know exactly what it\u2019s like feeling you can\u2019t have something of your own. So, that\u2019s really annoying. Maybe next time she could come up with her own ideas. And yeah, using AI sucks. \n\nYou are obviously really jealous over your sisters success. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because her fake art is doing better than you, because she looks better to the charity you donate to, or both. Maybe more. But regardless, it\u2019s obvious and YTA for the way you handled everything. Seems like a good self reflection moment. \n\nYour parents are also the AHs. There\u2019s no way all of this has been going on without them knowing. Very clearly resentment towards your sister and I\u2019m not sure how they haven\u2019t noticed. \n\nFeelings don\u2019t negate actions.", "YTA.  Luddites always are.", "If any of this is true, then YTA if anything for getting your panties in a bunch about AI art.  New tools are here, they're changing the art biz.  That's just how it is.", "YTA - Welcome to the new world kiddo. Try not to punish those who are better suited to it than you.", "YTA\n\nShe is raising money for charity selling T-shirts not canvases\n\nAnd hate to break it to you selling T-shirts for charity art or not is not an original or even uncommon idea.\n\nUnder your name or company \u2026. is she claiming that they are original works of art created by her\u2026if she isn\u2019t she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.", "YTA. I can't say I approve of AI generated art, but she has had success with this and fair play to her. You started the fight so I'm unclear why you seem to upset that she retaliated in kind.
