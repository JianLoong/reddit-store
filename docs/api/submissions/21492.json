I will not be able to babysit her child because my other sister is graduating and my other sister want me to attend her graduation, which is 5 hours travel, so i asked my sister a half and day off. She's going through a lot and here i am going on a graduation and just straight up yelled at her that it was a PRIVILEGE and she should be GRATEFUL that we- i am helping her.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your sister doesn't respect you and feels entitled to boss you around because you're so much younger in her eyes. Don't allow that", "NTA\n\nyou are right, she should be grateful . Also ask her next time she complains,  what is she going to do if you move out one day... I mean you are 18, you should be starting your life, enjoying experiences etc... you should not have to play substitute parent to her kids.", "NTA. Is your sister getting child support? She may also be able to ask for half of the daycare costs so she can put the children in daycare a couple weeks. There are programs that offer childcare lower fees for low income families. Is your sister getting food stamps?\n\nYour sister needs to realize that her children are her responsibility and not yours. At 18 you should be either working a full-time job or in school looking for opportunities to improve your life, not babysitting her children for free because she couldn\u2019t figure out how to prevent pregnancy.", "NTA - one of the many reasons why abortion would shouldn\u2019t be a stigma.", "I really am thankful for the comments. I've been thinking about it alot and getting an outsider pov on the matter really help clear things up. I've been riddled with guilt when i dont take my sister circumstances into consideration and yell at her about being grateful and the privilege that she's experiencing when we are helping her, it just feels like I'm being an ass and shows that i don't really like taking care of my nephew, (which i really love taking care of them). She's in an emotional wreck and so do i, i still feel an ass for yelling because im sure the kids hear all the yelling and fighting which is obviously not a good environment for the kids, so im reflecting on the way i act and my emotional state. \n\nAnd i just want add, why i- we feel responsible for my sister is that we grew up with my parents telling us how we should help each other and share the burden so the other wouldn't be helpless. And my sister is the oldest and she really is like a second mother to us, that's why i-we feel inclined to help. But after reading your thoughts it made me rethink my definition of family. Thank you again. Hope ya'll have a really nice dinner.", "NTA\n\nI cand stand out when thanking for help is taking advantage..you are not free childcare and is not your reaponsibility that she is single mother...dont be pushed to not your problems", "Not your kids.

She put herself in said circumstances by choice and she should carry the responsibility, you have your own life to live. If you had kids now would she help you with your kids as much as you're helping with hers? Or if it was the opposite, if she didn't have kids at all and you did? Helping is fine but being guilt tripped into it or demanded to give up your own life to raise kids with her is not. Why doesn't she demand from father of her kids to help? You're \"easy target\" so to say cause she feels like she has authority over you.\n\nAnd about lashing out part.. Sadly sometimes people won't hear you out any other way.", "It\u2019s not about whether you love them or not. It\u2019s about ensuring people have a choice especially when they aren\u2019t stable enough in their life. Someone making minimum wage, cannot raise a child(ren) on their own. They should reconsider if they really want to bring kids at that stage of their life.\n\nWhat people don\u2019t realise is the impact on the kids through no fault of their own. Having kids is a privilege and people should really think it through before having them\n\nPregnancy can happen, having a choice(without the stigma) should be normalised", "\"Significant Other\" a partner.  They're asking whether you live with parents or with your own boyfriend or girlfriend.", "Thank you. You're an eye opener. With the question you asked. The answer is no. Now that I'm thinking about it, when she and i are working (i dropped out of college and work to save up money for my own tuition) our mother asked her to pay for the a one month water bills, in which the same day, she lashed out at us for using the water \"too much\" and demanded my mom that I should also pay the electric bill. Wow, now i realize we've been catering her needs all the time. Maybe that's why she feels like she have an authority over us just like you said.\n\nTbh, when we fought i always tell her that she and the kids are not our responsibility but would always feel guilty for not helping her enough to the point that she would tell us that she feels alone and we are not helping her. Maybe that's why i always feel guilty, she might be guilt tripping us because reason tells me that i shouldn't feel guilty but i did. And we cater to her again. It became a cycle. I could guess what will happen next after our fight. I- we would take care of the children as always and wait until she talk to us, then that's the que for us to talk to her. Not the other way around because she will got mad. We've been catering her needs to just avoid the fight/drama but i think we made it worst. I'll definitely talk to my fam and sibling about this, and hopefully we'll stop my sister from guilt tripping us. Really thank you. It made me reflect a lot as i write. I really hope that you also not feel guilty over the things that are not in your control and that you have a nice dinner.", "Might sound dumb, I never really thought about that. Mental health is stigma in my country, what more abortion.\n\nWhat i mean about it not relating to the post is that my sister cannot have abortion because she's not pregnant and gave birth last year, but i ger your point that if we have enough knowledge and compassion about the life of the child that they will be giving birth, i think her life might change. But yeah, getting abortion not for medical reason but because they can't take responsibility for their own action is what I'm against, in which is my sister and her ex situation.", "I'm a bit older than you but I had big heart like you when I was 18 and later, too. Life taught me to know better than just comply to requests to avoid fights, so yes I live now guilt free life and I have no issue saying no when needed. Don't give up your college, don't give up your fun time, years go by really fast, you'll be 25 in a blink of an eye having to catch up with things you didn't have chance to do \"on time\" because you catered other people's needs. I'm sending you much love girlie and wishing you nice dinner too without this burden on your back \ud83d\udc95 happy to help and thank you for kind words", "Thank you, no one really said that to me. I dropped out of college to give way to my other siblings who's both graduating. I work after dropping out to save money for my own college tuition fee but ended up giving all the money to other older sibling for their tuition because she's graduating student that time and needed a lot of money. I thought it was normal, but i really did catered to my family too much.\n\nI always reflect on my action, on how i should've done better to not hurt and help my fam but never really take into consideration my own self. The last time i gift myself was when i get my first paycheck, i bought a cute pins which is 0.18$ if converted. And give all my money to my parents. And it's been a year since i last contacted my friends.\n\nYou really help me today, and im really grateful. I'll try my best to love myself. And I really love studying, so i don't think I'll ever give up on that one in this lifetime. I'll be working again and studying this year. Again, thank you. It might sound an exaggeration but i really think you help me and you're one of the reason why started/will be starting to change myself to be better. I'll be forever be grateful to you, so i hope- i will wish on my prayers that you will always overcome your problem and that you will always have a nice food on your meal. Really thank you.", "NAH You're not responsible for her child. She's probably telling the truth about work. I'm sure it's stressful for everyone.", "Yeah its been a really stressful day for both of us. Maybe talking later will be good, but I will really try to emphasize that her child is not our- my responsibility. I'll take a step forward to stop being an enabler. Thank you for your insight. Hope you have a nice dinner.", "So your sister would rather burden you and your parents than complete some paperwork? She clearly has no motivation to improve things for herself or her children as long as you and your parents pick up the slack. \n\nNTA\n\nAnd I hope those siblings you gave money to for tuition will do the same for you, especially since they should be far better paid (than you) now that they've graduated.", "Yeah i also think so after reading the comments. We are partly at fault for always catering at my sister's need because of her poor circumstances but never really take into consideration our own.\n\nAnd my sibling just straight up told my parent when she asked about helping me a no- that she would be just be helping if she wants to. Which i agree with her, i really don't want to burden her with some obligation. I help her because i want to and not really expecting a help in return. I'll try to manage my own, i mean i can help someone to graduate, what more my own self.\n\nAnd yeah, thank you for your insight. I no longer feel that guilty because i kept telling myself that the situation my sister are in right now, is what she puts herself into not us- not me. So I shouldn't feel responsible for her. Again thank you. Hope you have a nice dinner.", "Oh thank you, I'm not really that knowledgeable on internet shortcut \ud83d\ude05", "You're truly a pure heart and I believe life will bless you in many ways but you have to stand up for yourself and put yourself in position to receive those blessings. \n\nYou can be there for your family without ruining your life and if they expect you to ruin your life and sacrifice your important things for their comfort it tells you all you need to know about them.\n\nGood luck and thank you for your kind words \u2764\ufe0f", "Again thank you. I'll be sleeping with a smile. Thank you.", "And you also have a big heart. Your advice really help a stranger- me. Im forever grateful to you.", "i dont like people who have kids or adopt pets and then expect someone else to take responsibility for those kids or the pets. i really dont like those kinds of people", "NTA but if you have an agreement that you'll watch the kids and you tell her she has to miss work after the schedule is already made, that could lead to her losing hours at best, or at worse getting fired. I believe in family helping family but you need to express clearly that you're not willing to help and she needs to arrange for a sitter or daycare.", "NTA. Your sister seems to have forgotten that you are doing her massive favors on a frequent basis and seems to see it as an entitlement.", "NTA Even if she was paying you, you get to take days off.", "OP, I'm glad the responses have helped, and I also want to say that you are NTA. It sounds like you've spent your whole life giving pieces of yourself to the people you love, and they aren't giving anything back to you. You deserve love and care and to have someone step in to help when you're struggling and to care about how you are doing and to make sure that your needs are being taken care of. If someone is asking you to do something for them that they wouldn't gladly do for you, they are the selfish one, not you. \n\nIf I asked what makes you happy, would you have an answer that doesn't include making other people happy? I'm guessing you've put yourself to the side for so long that you aren't even sure how to want something just for yourself. You get to have things for yourself. You get to be happy in yourself. You get to choose things that make you happy just because they make you happy. That isn't selfish, it's caring for yourself the same way you have always cared for other people."]}
