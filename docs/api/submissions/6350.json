We were spending time with each other and being civil. I was walking by their room with the laundry when I overheard my brother and his wife arguing over something. It was something about her promising to not do something, but having done it recently. I quickly left and thought nothing of it and didn\u2019t mention it. My SIL (sister in law) works at a big corporation where we\u2019re from. The two men who own the business are notorious for cheating on their wives with their female employees. My SIL always tries to outdo everyone like when she told my sister that we were all supposed to dress casually for an event she was hosting and my sister showed up in jeans and a sweater while everyone was wearing fancy clothes. The next day my brother was in a bad mood while my SIL kept asking him what we had done to him. He told her to just leave it. She insisted that we should talk about what my family had done to upset him. He got up and went to their room. My friend who works at the company told me that people in the company were talking about the fact that she had recently slept with one of the bosses for benefits and had done it before. I told her it wasn\u2019t possible and that I had to go. I walked past their room and overheard my SIL telling my brother that if he divorced her she would take the children. I was appalled because she\u2019s usually been wonderful. Later, at dinner things were a little tense. She kept nagging on brother telling him his bad mood didn\u2019t suit him, that he was embarrassing her, and that I must be ashamed to have a brother like him. I snapped and told her that I was embarrassed that I had her as a SIL and that her doing that to my brother wouldn\u2019t be tolerated and that she should get the fuck out. Everyone froze and they quickly got up and left after a minute.

I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve been right to explode at her about office gossip you *just heard* and can\u2019t directly substantiate; especially not before you had a chance to talk to your brother about it first. That said, her conduct at dinner was unacceptable in any circumstance. She was antagonizing and humiliating your brother, and she used you all as tools in visiting her cruelty upon him. Ain\u2019t nobody gonna do that to *my* brother, in *my* house, while eating *my* food at *my* dinner table. **HELL NO**. Whether or not the office gossip proves true, there was obviously something very intense going on between the two of them and she thought it wise to emotionally castrate him in front of his family. That\u2019s just sociopathic-level cruelty and I wouldn\u2019t tolerate it either.", "NTA, might be different if she wasn't deliberately trying to push his buttons in front of the entire family, but it was their drama that was the issue, not you calling her out on it.", "NTA. She wanted to use her body as a means for advancement, she can suffer the consequences for it. In your shoes, I wouldn't allow her back in my home. If she gets upset at people judging her for her behavior, then she shouldn't have done it in the first place \n\nI feel for your brother being put in a bad spot with the threat of taking the kids, and for the mental toll this is assuredly taking on him. He's probably not in the best mental state to think clearly about who's being an asshole in this situation.", "You\u2019re a protective sister who is showing love by defending your brother against a woman who is not treating him well, to say the least. However - you\u2019re not privy to the whole story. And you\u2019ve guns akimbo into a situation you know little-to-nothing about. Good intentions aside, you\u2019ve almost certainly made the situation worse.\n\nPerhaps it would have been better to pull your brother aside and speak to him honestly when it was just the two of you. Allow him to open up and let you know how you can be supportive. If his answer is \u201cmake a giant scene around the failure of my marriage at dinner\u201d then absolutely go nuts. Otherwise - take his lead. But realize there is more than one way to offer support to someone you love who is struggling. \n\nBut look - what you did out of witnessing someone hurting a person you care about. Show yourself some kindness.", "Info:  After repeatedly watching her yell at your brother for days, did you ever talk to him about it?", "NTA. She had it coming nagging your brother in front of everyone. The moment she brought you into the public verbal abuse towards your brother at the table, she opened a can of worms she wasn\u2019t ready for. If she didn\u2019t want you involved, she shouldn\u2019t brought you into it by saying you were \u201cashamed to have a brother like him\u201d. She\u2019s mentally abusive.", "Info: I don\u2019t understand your story at all.  What exactly did she provably do that caused you to say this to her?  Were you angry based on an unconfirmed rumor?  Were you angry about their private conversation into which you eavesdropped?", "NTA. You saw your brother being verbally *abused* by a woman who had just cheated on him, so you stepped in. The shit she was saying was meant to cut deep and put the weight of her actions on his shoulders, and she did it right in front of you. Imagine how she treats him in private. Try not to be mad at your brother for his reaction. He's in an awful position. It must really fuck with a person to be married to someone you need to ask not to cheat on you.", "ESH.\n\nNot your place to get involved in that way, but she was definitely baiting something to happen. If he was leaving it alone, you probably should have too.", "NTA. She was creating a scene then brought you into it.", "ESH\n\nIt's not your call how your brother handles his marriage. And you should have stayed out of it. Your brother and SIL should not have brought the argument into your home.", "This is so confusing I think it is fake.  If it isn\u2019t fake, then all I can go with is ESH, except maybe your brother.  You because it sounds like at some point you eavesdropped on conversations and stuck your nose into their business and we\u2019re rude to guests in your house.\n And your SIL, who you think is usually \u201cwonderful\u201d even though she lied to your sister and is unfaithful to your brother, sucks because she doesn\u2019t sound \u201cwonderful\u201d. She sounds cruel.", "ESH - but your brother it seems. You eavesdropped on their conversations and your brother told you not to get involved.", "Quick.  Correct your typo at the end.  Stupid autocorrect.\n\nNow that\u2019s out of the way, your loyalty is to your brother and you Momma-beared him.  And to a very shocking piece of news!\nNTA.  You\u2019re going to respond in some way or another.  Might as well be that.", "NTA for calling out her observable behaviour at the dinner table but you shouldn\u2019t have mentioned anything you heard secondhand or through eavesdropping (even accidental). It\u2019s not right for her to treat your brother like that, but it\u2019s up to him to set those boundaries and you likely embarrassed him as well sharing that info in the way you did.\n\nYou would\u2019ve been entirely entitled to defend against her remarks to you, saying you aren\u2019t at all ashamed of him and what\u2019s actually bothering people is her berating him for how he is being. If you\u2019re concerned about him you could\u2019ve pulled him aside and asked him about it privately or offered a listening ear, instead of airing personal info that isn\u2019t yours to share (and may not even be true) at a family dinner. If you want to support him your behaviour has likely only pushed him away from you. \n\nApologise for talking about things that you weren\u2019t involved in, you can tell him you care and it comes from a good place and you\u2019ll be here for him no matter what, and you don\u2019t like him being spoken to/about like that, but take responsibility for that parts you shouldn\u2019t have done. Then give him space to calm down and forgive in his own time.", "NTA and i dont agree with the ESH comments at all. They were arguing about it in OPs home. SIL was trying to pin everything on her brother while playing innocent. OP is well within her rights to take the trash out of her house", "You had ZERO right to exacerbate an already volatile situation based on what you overheard and/or gossip.  You made a bad situation worse,  and forced their hand instead of letting them handle it their own time with their own way of dealing with privacy issues. \n\nSiL might suck, (barely a question, I know) but she is not here asking for judgement.  \n\nYTA. Sorry.", "50/50", "YTA. You have no idea what actually happened besides rumor an innuendo. You certainly have no business snooping on arguments between your brother and his wife.\n\nYou may feel you were standing up for your brother, but your brother clearly does not agree with you. He is correct: you are an asshole and should mind your own business.", "Everybody pretty much sucks, but YTA for what you said. \n\nAside from the fact you shouldn't have inserted yourself into someone else's marriage, you did so based on gossip. \n\nDid you see, with your own two eyes, your sister-in-law engaging in sexual activities with her employer? Did she tell you she had sex with her employer? If neither of those things happened, you don't know what happened. \n\nEven if you did know, do you really think your brother wanted anyone else to know about it? You're TA for embarrassing your brother, regardless of what his wife was up to. \n\nAnd before anyone else comes at me, have you read 'Are You There God It's Me Margaret?' Remember the character who has bigger breasts and a bad reputation because of them? Who turns out to be a good Catholic girl who's never been kissed? Well, it's a lesson about how reliable gossip is, even when everybody knows it's absolutely true.", "ESH, you are eavesdropping then spreading gossip.
