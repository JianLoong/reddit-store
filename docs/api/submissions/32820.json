I\u2019ve had problems with alcohol dependency between the ages of 17-21 and I\u2019m 2 years sober. My close friends know this and have supported me over the past few years which I am very thankful for, as I know I would have really struggled without them. \nMy friend Anna (29 F) threw a Christmas party at her house on the weekend. Anna knows all about my alcoholism in the past and had been one of those friends who supported me. When I arrived, Anna was already quite tipsy as she said she\u2019d been drinking most of the day already while setting up for the party. I brought some non alcoholic drinks with me to the party since I know Anna would mostly have alcohol there. I have been around my friends while they have been drunk a few times now and didn\u2019t think this night would be any different.\nAfter being at the party for about an hour, Anna found me with a hot chocolate that she said she had made for me. I stupidly didn\u2019t question it and thanked her, thinking nothing of it. A little while later, she had found me again and said she saw I drank the first one and made me another hot chocolate. I thanked her again. She smiled at me and then sat next to me on the couch where I was chatting with another friend. When I was halfway done with my second hot chocolate, Anna asked me if I liked her hot chocolate recipe. I said yes. She started to laugh and when I asked her what was funny, she said she always makes her hot chocolates with some Irish liqueur and continued laughing. I asked why she would give an ex-alcoholic whisky in a hot chocolate. She said she thought it would be funny, which hurt me honestly. She\u2019s seen me at my worst and witnessed how hard it was for me to seek help and stop drinking. I told her this and she rolled her eyes and told me to \u201clighten up, it\u2019s Christmas.\u201d I left the party after she said this and once I got home, I had messages from both Anna and the other friend I was talking to on the couch saying I blew up for no reason and caused a big scene which left Anna feeling very embarrassed. I didn\u2019t respond.\nI called my sister the next day and told her what had happened and she said she understands why I was upset, but thinks I made a big deal out of a stupid joke. Was I right to leave the party?

Hopefully it will make it less likely that she does anything so criminally stupid in future.\n\nTell her that she owes you a huge apology. Friends don't behave that way. Normal adults don't behave that way. \n\nIt wasn't a joke. Jokes are funny. This wouldn't have been funny or acceptable even if you were not in recovery, or even of you'd been drinking and the joke was that you'd said you didn't like the liqueur and she'd tricked you into drinking something you don't normally like. \n\nEvan assuming she was drinking and her judgement was affected as a result, this is just wrong, and she was apparently sober enough to plan this nd execute it.", "NTA\n\nAs an alcoholic myself, sober now 33 days, I\u2019d probably have done the same thing.

Well, gf, it isn't a joke if the butt of it isn't laughing and you've deliberately tried to harm them.  \n\nBeing drunk herself isn't an excuse.  Alcohol doesn't make you somebody else.  Alcohol shows you *exactly* who the person is when their sense of social constraints are lowered.  She just showed you who she is.  Believe it.  There are really lots of good people out there to have relationships with who won't treat you disrespectfully.", "NTA and it would be completely, utterly, absolutely understandable if you never spoke to this person again. \n\nWhen I first read the title I thought she gifted you a bottle of liquor or wine, and that would have been bad enough (and still NTA), but she mixed alcohol into a beverage she served you and pulled a \u201cgotcha?!\u201d  I don\u2019t think I would be able to repair a friendship after that.  \n\nHope you\u2019re doing okay and can get any extra support you may need.", "NTA, NTA, NTA. Just not ok behaviour. Well done on getting sober, and I hope you keep  winning the fight.", "Definitely NTA. God, if it was me I would\u2019ve thrown the hot chocolate in her face.
