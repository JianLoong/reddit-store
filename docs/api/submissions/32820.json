I\u2019ve had problems with alcohol dependency between the ages of 17-21 and I\u2019m 2 years sober. My close friends know this and have supported me over the past few years which I am very thankful for, as I know I would have really struggled without them. \nMy friend Anna (29 F) threw a Christmas party at her house on the weekend. Anna knows all about my alcoholism in the past and had been one of those friends who supported me. When I arrived, Anna was already quite tipsy as she said she\u2019d been drinking most of the day already while setting up for the party. I brought some non alcoholic drinks with me to the party since I know Anna would mostly have alcohol there. I have been around my friends while they have been drunk a few times now and didn\u2019t think this night would be any different.\nAfter being at the party for about an hour, Anna found me with a hot chocolate that she said she had made for me. I stupidly didn\u2019t question it and thanked her, thinking nothing of it. A little while later, she had found me again and said she saw I drank the first one and made me another hot chocolate. I thanked her again. She smiled at me and then sat next to me on the couch where I was chatting with another friend. When I was halfway done with my second hot chocolate, Anna asked me if I liked her hot chocolate recipe. I said yes. She started to laugh and when I asked her what was funny, she said she always makes her hot chocolates with some Irish liqueur and continued laughing. I asked why she would give an ex-alcoholic whisky in a hot chocolate. She said she thought it would be funny, which hurt me honestly. She\u2019s seen me at my worst and witnessed how hard it was for me to seek help and stop drinking. I told her this and she rolled her eyes and told me to \u201clighten up, it\u2019s Christmas.\u201d I left the party after she said this and once I got home, I had messages from both Anna and the other friend I was talking to on the couch saying I blew up for no reason and caused a big scene which left Anna feeling very embarrassed. I didn\u2019t respond.\nI called my sister the next day and told her what had happened and she said she understands why I was upset, but thinks I made a big deal out of a stupid joke. Was I right to leave the party? Or are Anna and my sister right?", "created_utc": 1702297298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ftbrm/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_friend_for_giving_me/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is egregious! It is a **massively** big deal.\n\n NTA in the slightest. Holy shit, you have terrible friends and sister.", "NTA. Anna is an absolute AH. So is everyone who agrees with her. And that is putting it mildly. Anyone who would trick a recovering alcoholic into drinking alcohol has no morals whatsoever. Kudos to you for going home when you did!", "NTA..   she fucked with your sobriety, that is not a \"joke\"", "NTA.\n\nAnna was a complete giant ahole. If she is that way or it was because the alcohol got the better of herself, I cannot say of course. But I think it was the right thing to get out of that situation before worse could have happened. \n\nHiw are you holding up? It would be very bad if annas asshole-behaviour would made you start drinking again. Do you have a support net, a doctor etc.? \n\nI guess your sister does not understand the gravitas of the situation 100%? You never ever give an addict the suvstance he / she is addicted to, especially not as a joke. I mean she would not punch someone who had a operation on the spleen right on the back just fun, right?", "NTA.  What Anna did was a violation of trust that endangered OP's wellbeing.  I can believe she thought it was funny while drunk, but her continued behavior after the fact seems to suggest malicious undertones.  Leaving, without making a scene I might add, was absolutely the right call and in no way disruptive to anyone else in attendance.\n\nSounds like it's time to cut Anna's drunk AH out of your life unless she offers a sincere apology that indicates she understands why what she did was wrong.", "WTF is wrong with the other friend and your sister to say you made a big deal out of it? That was a fucking awful thing to do to someone, absolutely unforgivable NTA", "NTA. That was really shitty of her!", "NTA , everyone else is an absolute AH. That's NOT funny that's DISRESPECTFUL and HARMFUL. She's no friend of yours. I'd recommend you to avoid her in the future .", "NTA\n\nOmg what is wrong with your friends and your sister??\n\nAnna shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed- she should be ASHAMED.\n\nYour friends are idiots and your sister needs her head checked.", "Anna is more than asshole\u2026\u2026she\u2019s a sadistic selfish psycho who is NOT a friend.   You\u2026..NTA.  And congrats on your sobriety, friend.", "NTA.\n\nThose are not your friends, and your sister is completely wrong.", "You're definitely NTA but everyone else is, you're a recovering alcoholic and they gave you alcohol, that's not a joke I would have been fuming and probably wouldn't have left that party quietly.", "NTA. Both Anna and the other one are not your friends. It sounds like there was something twisted or sinister about her \u201cjoke\u201d - could she have some underlying issues (eg envy) against you?", "NTA you was technically spiked. I bet everyone at that party would have had a different opinion if Anna put drugs in your hot chocolate. But because alcohol is legal it\u2019s a joke. I watch my parents have addiction all my life till it killed my dad. I hope your well and continue the hard fight xx", "NTA. You need new friends.", "NTA. It wasn't just a stupid joke...... It was an incredibly disrespectful, harmful evil thing to do! She probably would have never given you alcohol had she not already gotten drunk herself but that's just one great reason to NOT hang out with people who are drinking. You might be able to trust yourself at this point but s*** happens and it's better to be safe than sorry.", "NTA.  Let's say you weren't an alcoholic & Anna or someone else put a pill in your drink before giving it to you. Would that be OK with you? Would your sister be OK with it happening to her?\nWhat Anna did with the alcohol isn't funny. It's certainly not ok. To top it off, she did it Twice. She is not your friend. Stay away from her.", "NTA. Giving someone a drink with alcohol in it without telling them is an AH move. Doing it to someone who is sober is even worse. You were right to leave : this is not a joke and these people did not act like friends. I'm sorry and I hope you're ok OP.", "NTA Anna is not your friend if she did this to you, and your sister is also an asshole. Well done for being sober for so long and don\u2019t let these horrible people knock you off track \ud83e\udd70.", "NTA. What she did was completely unacceptable.\n\nEven if you were not a recovering alcoholic, messing with someone's food or rink without their knowledge, is incredibly irresponsible . \n\nEven without your past history, For all she knew, you could have been going to drive, or could have been taking medication which doesn't mix well with alcohol.\n\nIt's good that she was left feeling embarrassed. Hopefully it will make it less likely that she does anything so criminally stupid in future.\n\nTell her that she owes you a huge apology. Friends don't behave that way. Normal adults don't behave that way. \n\nIt wasn't a joke. Jokes are funny. This wouldn't have been funny or acceptable even if you were not in recovery, or even of you'd been drinking and the joke was that you'd said you didn't like the liqueur and she'd tricked you into drinking something you don't normally like. \n\nEvan assuming she was drinking and her judgement was affected as a result, this is just wrong, and she was apparently sober enough to plan this nd execute it.", "NTA\n\nAs an alcoholic myself, sober now 33 days, I\u2019d probably have done the same thing. Ana can never be trusted again.", "NTA!  First, you don't lie about other people's food.  You just don't.  Second, that your gf would do that \"as a joke\" when she knows about the problem tells you right there *everything you need to know about her.*  She's going to do things at your expense which could seriously, seriously cause you problems or danger, and she's going to try to manipulate you by saying it's just a joke.  Well, gf, it isn't a joke if the butt of it isn't laughing and you've deliberately tried to harm them.  \n\nBeing drunk herself isn't an excuse.  Alcohol doesn't make you somebody else.  Alcohol shows you *exactly* who the person is when their sense of social constraints are lowered.  She just showed you who she is.  Believe it.  There are really lots of good people out there to have relationships with who won't treat you disrespectfully.", "NTA and it would be completely, utterly, absolutely understandable if you never spoke to this person again. \n\nWhen I first read the title I thought she gifted you a bottle of liquor or wine, and that would have been bad enough (and still NTA), but she mixed alcohol into a beverage she served you and pulled a \u201cgotcha?!\u201d  I don\u2019t think I would be able to repair a friendship after that.  \n\nHope you\u2019re doing okay and can get any extra support you may need.", "NTA, NTA, NTA. Just not ok behaviour. Well done on getting sober, and I hope you keep  winning the fight.", "Definitely NTA. God, if it was me I would\u2019ve thrown the hot chocolate in her face. I don\u2019t even think I can fully imagine the hurt you must\u2019ve felt to lose two years of hard work and recovery because someone you trusted betrayed you in such a personal way and everyone invalidating your extremely valid feelings on the matter can go shove it.", "Nta. Anna is not a friend.", "NTA, definitely go NC until every single one of your so call friends that suppose to be your support system reach out and apologize to you and that includes your sister for her remark about you making a big deal out of a stupid joke.", "NTA.  Who the hell would do that to a friend? Fuck Anna.", "NTA. You are underreacting.", "NTA And Anna is NOT your friend. You never trick a recovering alcoholic into drinking.
