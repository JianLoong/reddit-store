Go back to where you came from and leave our house alone.\"\n\nI got mad at that, and yelled at her, and said that if she says anything like that again, she has to leave. I continued \"Actually, you can leave yourself if you've got a problem. I am helping my brother even if I lose you as a girlfriend.\"\n\nShe's livid at me, said that I don't care about her opinion, etc. My brother was upset at what she said, but I assured him that nothing like that would happen again, and we're fine now.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702570939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ica0e/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_leave_the_house/", "score": 1059, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
