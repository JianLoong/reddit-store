Good for you.", "NTA\n\nThey were guests in your home and if they didnt like the accommodations then they should have booked the hotel to begin with, rather than stay with you and be rude and ungrateful.\n\nIt sounds like they invited themselves, rather than you inviting them, which makes them even more rude.", "NTA, if they weren't happy with the arrangement from the start they shouldn't have taken up the offer. What were they expecting? For you and your husband to give up your bed and sleep on the floor?\n\nAlso, it could be understandable if there were some noise given that they are cramped with 2 three year olds and maybe they had some difficulty sleeping, but that is quite different from playing wrestle.\n\nYour MIL should have stood up to her husband, not brushed it off as your problem and your husband should probably grow some balls and learn how to oppose his mother", "NTA - If the accommodations you can provide are not up to their standards, the should stay elsewhere.  If they want to stay with you, they should keep their mouths shut.  It\u2019s never a good idea to teach people they can treat you poorly.", "NTA\n\nBut did I read it wrong or does your MIL have 3 year old twins?", "NTA. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers. If he has a problem with his FREE sleeping arrangements then he can find one himself.", "NTA they over stepped the boundaries of being a nice house guest. Also I'm like super intrigued about everyone involved ages", "ESH. The way you kicked them out was an AH move and clearly fueled by the fact that you didn\u2019t want them there to begin with. But, that was clearly the right choice because they weren\u2019t even trying to make it work. \n\nBut, why did anyone think that 4 people in one bed, two of them toddlers, was going to work (or be quiet)? This was a recipe for disaster from the get-go.", "Three yr olds can sleep on a folded up blanket. They might wake and crawl into bed with parents a few times, but you can usually carry them back to their bed pretty quick", "ESH but your husband and the children.\n\n>I really didn't want them here but I know he loves and misses her, and he wanted her to meet our seven month old son. Nearest hotel is pretty far and kind of gross.\n\nI think you overreacted to bad houseguests because you didn't want them there  and took the first opportunity to blow an inconvenience out of proportion.\n\n5:30 AM wake up seems like a normal thing when you have a 7 month old.\n\nCouldn't the baby have slept with you and the twins on a pallet in the nursery so you didn't have 4 people in a small guest bed?", "ESH except the kids and the husband.\n\nYou didn't want them there so you made their arrangements as uncomfortable as possible. Have you ever tried to sleep with a 3 yo? It's pure torture. I can't imagine two adults and two 3 yos in one bed. Ugh!\n\nThey were bad houseguests to wake you up. And not giving a proper apology.\n\nYou kicked them to the curb with no where to go. No hotel is going to accommodate them that early in the day.\n\nThen you have the nerve to expect them to come back to a place where you've made it entirely clear they are not welcome.\n\nYou didn't want them there and now they're not there. Not sure why you're complaining.", "ESH, but your in-laws suck worse. They should have known better than to try to cram 3-year old twins into a small home with an infant. And they shouldn't have been divas about the free hospitality (offered by new parents of an infant!) not meeting their expectations. They definitely should have attempted to keep their family quiet until a decent hour.\n\nYour offense was in responding in anger and issuing a dramatic pronouncement to scram without taking time to calm down and letting your husband know it was coming. You were right to ask them to find other accommodations, but wrong in the angry, abrupt, theatrical way you did it. It put your husband in a bad spot and damaged the bonds between the two families. They'll hold it against you (and him) forever. Just to keep the family peace, you'll have to eat a small portion of crow and apologize for doing it in anger instead of more calmly. You (personally) could offer to split the cost of the hotel with them as a peace offering, which would let them know you appreciate them making the effort to visit.", "No judgment  but a question. Couldn't the 3 year olds have bunked down on the floor in your child's room?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why did you force their kids to sleep in the same room? Don\u2019t you have a blanket for the floor or even better put them in the nursery and the baby in your room. I can\u2019t imagine they were to be there longer than a couple days. And it does suck to have to drive 20 or 40 minutes back and forth to a hotel for everything. That usually makes it so you see people only for 2-3 hours a day which is kind of a wasted trip.

One bed was not the wisest choice.\n\nedit: oops - I misread the age of the son as 7 years not 7 months. Yeah, the infant is too young for camping in the living room. Perhaps the 3 year olds could have used the nursery and the infant could have stayed in his parent's room just for the visit since he may need feeding during the night anyways.", "OP also kicked out her husband's mother without even running it by her husband.

Also I don't really trust them not to wake up and climb on stuff", "Right? My kid (now 4yo) has always slept in the same room as my husband and I because we\u2019re not about to demand separate rooms from whom ever is hosting us.
