For the most part, his family is lovely and we get along well. \n\nThe party started at 6 and everyone had a good time. Around 10, people started to make their way out.

A little after midnight I heard the doorbell ring and heard unfamiliar voices and laughter.\n\nI went downstairs to discover my 20 something niece (who was still there) had invited 7 of her friends to the party (without our permission) and they were just showing up because they left their city late and underestimated the time it took to drive to our places (about 7 hours). They strolled into our house with some of them not saying anything to me and the older adults and asked my niece what was for dinner. \n\nI tried to shut it down and said that the party is over and it\u2019s after midnight. A girl in the group said that they\u2019ve been driving for so long and she doesn\u2019t want to be in the car anymore then another girl told my niece (without looking at me) that everything is closed so if they don\u2019t eat now, they won\u2019t be able to eat until morning. I pointed out the gas stations are still opened when my SIL (niece\u2019s mom) told the group she can heat up some food for them. We got into a heated discussion and I told SIL she can leave and feed them at her house. My husband led me upstairs, begged me to just let his sister feed the group, and we argued. It was almost 2 before I could get our toddler to sleep due to the noise and the smell of food coming from downstairs.\n\nToday at lunch, another SIL made a passive aggressive comment about being a good host so I told her directly that a good guest doesn\u2019t bring additional guests.

You wanted to turn kids away that drove 7 hours to visit with a friend to eat gas station food.\n\nNiece sucks because she should have let you know more people were coming. Plates could have been prepared ahead of time, and everyone would have been prepared for a visit. But, kids are stupid. We can call them out on it, but in this case after the fact and not in front of her friends would be more appropriate.\n\nSIL sucks because this is not her house. It is not her place. She\u2019s not respecting your home as your domain, or you. Ultimately, it is your choice on who you accept into your home and when.
