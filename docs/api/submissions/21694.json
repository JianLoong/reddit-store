They strolled into our house with some of them not saying anything to me and the older adults and asked my niece what was for dinner. \n\nI tried to shut it down and said that the party is over and it\u2019s after midnight.

Because a group of 7 20-something girls couldn't possibly find another party, right? I have never heard of anything like that ever happening. That just...doesn't make a lick of sense. Where were they planning on sleeping? After eating did they turn around and drive 7 hours back? Did they all pile into a cheap motel? The niece just didn't mention at any point \"oh btw, I have 7 friends driving here and it's a 7 hour long drive\" And where does this SIL live? And why did it took 2 extra hours to \"heat up some food\" it takes me about 10-15 minutes to eat. Did they stay after and wash dishes? What did the SIL actually say when you were like \"sorry, party is over. Take these kids to your house and feed them\" You took the time to add all this detail about the before prep (very irrelevant info btw such as wasting characters letting us know everyone had a nice time) but didn't say what the SIL actually said when you asked her to feed them at her house? How convenient for the perfect little rage bait story! And your toddler upstairs couldn't sleep due to noise, sure okay.. but \"the smell of food\"? (wow more wasted characters that could have went towards the actual interaction that was just completely not mentioned).\n\nAnd the next day the rest of your family would actually defend 7 uninvited guests you never met showing up to a family reunion 2 hours after it was over while you were literally putting your toddler to bed and they hung out for 2 additional hours after arriving. And they all said you were a bad host even though you did let them stay and eat your food? If this story actually happened (and you are a reliable narrator, meaning it happened exactly like you said) I will cut off my left hang and post a picture.\n\nThis just reads like a typical Reddit ragebait story for karma farm (or whatever it is that leads people to make up these creative writing thought experiments) like the king of made up Reddit stories. A persona that has a normal social/family life knows human interaction like this wouldn't happen. And if it did, only the most weird favorite having dysfunctional family would insult OP the next day. Entitled people exist sure. But all the little details, just so absurd. This is literal text book Reddit fiction, hitting all the check marks of the \"family member from hell and their entitlement\".

We had these family friends (you know, the kind you're so close to that you call aunt and uncle even though you're not related to them at all), who we partied with pretty regularly.  This was at a beach town, and they actually \\*would\\* throw huge parties where so many people came that if one of their young-adult sons had invited 7 random friends, they would have just been absorbed into the entire mass of people.  My dad and my \"uncle\" Harry definitely shared an interest in large parties that would last for hours and involved a lot of beer.\n\nThe thing I'm getting to is, one year, we wound up getting into a big car (me, who's probably like 12 or so at that point, my parents, my \"uncle\" Harry and \"aunt\" Pattie), and driving to what I later found out was the WEDDING of the kids of some people  whom Harry knew tangentially, up in northern NJ somewhere.

I do not know WHO in the wedding \"invited\" Harry, and I do NOT know by what authority Harry felt it was reasonable to just... bring along 3 extra people to this wedding reception.  If Harry only kind-of knew one of the families of the bride or groom (I don't know which one), then my parents and I were absolutely complete strangers to all of them.\n\nBut yeah, we essentially crashed this wedding reception, and my dad and Harry got to spend hours drinking beer, and I do not remember who stayed sober enough to drive us all home (my mom, I guess).  I was too busy being absolutely \\*mortified\\* about the entire thing.\n\nGranted, that was probably only a 3 or 4 hour drive, to attend a completely random family's wedding reception.

Option 2 is that the niece gave them the address and they would have had to put it into Google Maps or whatever in order to get directions to the actual house.\n\nMaybe it's my age showing (over 50), but I flat out do not believe that the niece gave them super detailed directions.

People who drive probably usually have at least a vague sense of what they can reach in a couple of hours in a car.  So if I'm in Columbus OH and you tell me we're invited to a party in Buffalo NY, I know \\*damned well\\* that's not just \"a couple of hours\".
