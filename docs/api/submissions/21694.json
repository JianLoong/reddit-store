They strolled into our house with some of them not saying anything to me and the older adults and asked my niece what was for dinner. \n\nI tried to shut it down and said that the party is over and it\u2019s after midnight. A girl in the group said that they\u2019ve been driving for so long and she doesn\u2019t want to be in the car anymore then another girl told my niece (without looking at me) that everything is closed so if they don\u2019t eat now, they won\u2019t be able to eat until morning.

At the very maximum, you give them some food to go.\n\nI\u2019d be super petty and bring friends to your SIL\u2019s house at the same time of night.\n\nI would also ring the other family members at the same time of night and hold them on the phone for a couple of hours, a lesser situation but one equally unbearable.\n\nI think either of those would cause big rifts to form so I\u2019d advise against it, but it would be fun.", "Nta they should ask first if they bring extra guests", "NTA. I would've kicked everyone out!", "Nta they were being very rude. Completely out of line. Don\u2019t host future events", "NTA what is wrong with your husband and family not to mention the niece and her friends. This is so bizarre I might have given them cold leftovers to go but at no point in the five hours of the party did your niece think to mention that she had invited friends and they were late.\n\nHonestly the biggest AH is your spineless husband and his pandering to his rude siblings and their entitled brats which is a sad statement to make about a 20 year old.", "NTA I would also be livid if I were in your shoes. \n\nIt\u2019s not your problem that they didn\u2019t plan ahead and leave early enough to make the party. For your niece to invite people to your house without telling you is rude and entitled. Also, it\u2019s ridiculous your SILs disregarded you in your house. And then your husband?!?!", "Wow that is freaking rude", "NTA \n\nShow up at hers with the whole family when you hear she's having a girls night. If she wants to make petty comments to avoid understanding her lack of respect, show her how it feels. (Excessive but lol)", "NTA- talk about entitled.", "NTA Who asks 7 strangers to a family reunion? Let me reiterate FAMILY reunion. Niece was out of line from the get go. Guests showing up at a stranger's house party at midnight unless you are a bunch of party hardy kids is not OK to follow that up.", "NTA.  Your niece had no right to invite a large group of her friends to your house at midnight without asking.  And these kids could\u2019ve prepared themselves better if they were hungry.", "NTA... Guests do not get to invite people to your home. Especially after midnight. Rude uninvited guests that dont aknowledge the home owner, dont get past the front door. \n\nThen you are made to feel like you did wrong. \n\nAH...1. your husband (no spine)\n2. SIL for no spine or pure ignorance \n3. Niece for ignorance and arrogance \n4. Husbands family that dont support you - they are wrong and spineless or just uncouth", "NTA. Who is dealing with the entitled niece and her entitled friends ?", "NTA   Tell your husband he\u2019s on baby duty the entire next day since he thought wit was so important to support your nieces friends instead of his wife and baby. It is stressful to have that many people show up at midnight when have a baby on top of it.  But if they don\u2019t agree then you should make sure to have a bunch of your friends show up at their house later at night the next time you visit.  I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be fine with it.", "NTA omg if I had been one of those people (20 is not a child) I would have been SO EMBARRASSED and left immediately. Your niece, SIL, and most of all your husband are all raging assholes.", "NTA.  Your husband is a dope.  My brother tried to do this with my nephew. I sent them all packing, to his house.", "I would of kicked the SIL and niece out with the \u2018kids\u2019 who are grown adults BTW!!!!!! \n\nIf husband didn\u2019t like that then he could leave too. \nNTA \nI repeat! NTA", "NTA your niece had absolutely no business inviting her friends to your party.  Judging by the way they didn't even acknowledge you it's pretty obvious they were entitled and without manners of any kind. If her mother wants to be a doormat for her kid that's not your problem, and you were right to tell them to get out. Your husband should be apologizing for not having your back.", "NTA. Never host a family event again.", "NTA op please update soon!", "NTA\n\nAlso, this should be the last time you ever host your husband's family. And if your husband has objections to that, he's welcome to find another place to stay too. This is absolutely ridiculous, and your husband should at least stay with his sister and let her be a good host to him until he apologizes", "NTA if it was a  7 hour drive it means they left around an acceptable dinnertime to arrive at your house. Your SIL, niece,  plus her \"guests\" disturbed your child in their own home. You should ask that part of your family whos comfort mattered more your child who was kept up or unannounced \"guests\".", "NTA. \n\nYour nieces friends are about as sharp as a bag of marbles if they underestimated the drive time by THAT much. \n\nAn hour or so late from that far away? Okay. \n\nParty starting at 6 and then not showing up for six more hours? Yeah, no. Your husband is an AH for not backing you up, especially knowing it\u2019s going to be an effort to get your kid to bed.", "INFO\n\n> By 11, the food was being put up.\n\nUp? What? Put *where*?", "Your NTA\u2026Just a party pooper", "ESH\n\nIts well documented in this popular comments why your husband's family are AHs.

No excuse that they were up until 2 AM.\n\n(Obviously I know if the child is ill or other circumstances can change things. But even if the neice hadn't invited friends, it still sounds like OP was an AH based on the toddlers bedtime.)", "Omg NTA and that would be the LAST time SIL and her daughter would be allowed at me house. The mf audacity", "The part here that matters the most is the fact that they invited not one, not two, but seven people. And didn't even ask you, didn't even tell you.

There is no way in hell this is acceptable. Your husband's family is rude asf*$% thinking this is okay.", "You are definitely NTA - your niece is a super mega AH, your SIL is a super mega AH and your husband is close behind. You are not overreacting. Seven people showing up after midnight to a stranger's house and demand food is incredibly obnoxious and entitled.", "NTA\nTell your husband he's in the dog house with you until he apologizes and starts backing you up. I don't know what you can do to get your point across but your husband specifically needs to feel consequences for not treating you with the respect you deserve", "OP is NTA.  A respectful guest asks if they can invite others to the gathering.  \"Hey, my friends from xxx are going to be in the area, can I ask them over?\"  Also, guests should not be arriving after certain times unless that is already planned, or possibly an emergency.  If a house guest invites strangers to a home that is not their own, they should expect that there could be issues.", "NTA. \n\nYour adult niece was the first one to be extremely rude by inviting others to YOUR house after midnight WITHOUT permission. Your SIL, was second, when she showed where your niece gets it from by bypassing what you were saying & went around you & your hubby by making these uninvited guests food & try to accommodate them. SIL is the type of parent who wants/is more a friend and not an actual parent to her child(ren). \n\nYour husbands reaction to SIL #2 injecting herself into the situation & all of the IL\u2019s putting it on OP says that OP has a husband problem more than an IL problem. \n\nOP, please open your eyes to this situation & any other previous situation that had this same outcome. You did nothing wrong. Your IL\u2019s were disrespectful to you, your family & home in many ways.", "NTA!!!! After midnight, with a toddler, people you were not asked if it was alright if they came over, AND in their 20s? They're grown enough to drive 7 hrs, they're grown enough to have 1) thought ahead and stopped to eat at a reasonable time/suck it up and get gas station food/wait until breakfast, 2) be polite guests and greet you,  3) respect you when you say they need to go, and 4) not take 2 hours when you do them the *favor* of allowing them to eat--pb&j or other easy stuff and GO.\n\nYour SIL (and niece) are MASSIVE AHs. 1) 20 somethings are adults. Young adults, but adults. 2) Genuinely, if it was such a big deal to feed them,  SIL should have done it *at HER house*. The entitlement from her and niece is infuriating. It's not their home.\n\nETA: Your husband is also an AH in this situation for telling you that you were overreacting and not backing you up.

Your husband, your niece, your SIL, and the guests who were not invited by you can draw straws over who is the biggest A-H.\n\n- niece: who the heck invites *friends to a family reunion*, especially one held in someone else's home?\n\n- niece's friends who don't even know you, strolling into your home at an inappropriate hour, then making demands even after being flat out told it was too late\n\n- SIL, just because she is raising self centered, oblivious children doesn't mean she should have audacity to overrule you in your own home and cater to the whims of rude adult children\n\n- husband,  my choice for Royal A-H, absolutely should have had your back and stood up to his sister, rather than dismissing your legitimate concerns then doubling down by telling you that you were overreacting", "Since your ILs think you are a bad host, don't have them over anymore.

The entire situation sucks balls enough but itself but I would be extra  livid if my son's routine was disrupted like this too, that's like the mouldy cherry on the cake for me.\n\nNTA OP. Husband is indeed massive, massive asshole.", "Yeah, husband failed the partner and decent human being test HARD here.  I'd have sent that entire group packing the moment they hit the door.  And my partner would have been right beside me.  OP's husband is massively disappointing.", "This. The only thing worse than having everyone against you, is having everyone AND your partner against you. Even if me and my husband don't agree, we will always defend each other in public and then speak in private.", "Absolutely this! NTA - You do not have an In-Law problem, you have a Husband Problem. I would suggest counseling and let him know that no more events will be hosted until he complies with it. Him allowing SiLs to railroad and run over you is extremely unacceptable. No one should be welcome into other people's house after midnight without the agreement of the home owner & being gracious. \n\nIf you let this go it will become an ongoing event in your life.", "Maybe during that 7-hour trip, or beforehand, someone could have have the decency to let OP know that's seven extra people are coming.", "Love this level of petty", "If I was one of those seven people and realized that I wasn't even invited and that the party was over, I would leave with or without my friends.

The niece shouldn't have invited people without permission, but they were already at your home. You put a smile , be a good host, and the next day, you have a serious talk with the niece. Maybe it's the difference between cultures, but in my culture, hospitality is important.  Whatever concerns you have can be discussed later when no one is hungry or tired. This is not about being right, you are right, no one should invite somebody to your house without your permission. However,  this is about kindness and being nice and lectures others when the time is right.", "Let them rest?! Yeah nah, no strangers that show up uninvited to my home at night are staying over, especially with my children in the house. That's just freaking insane to me.

Maybe her husband should have helped with the load so she could take care of the toddler. Honestly as a mother who has had family come over to stay it doesn't matter how hard you try to keep to a schedule. The very act of a bunch of people being in the house throws their schedule off. Also yes a sound machine helps but it only goes so far. You can't have it exceed certain decibels. So even if they were using ones guests can be too loud.", "> Get them on a decent routine.\n\nthis was ONE night. nowhere does OP say that her toddler typically stays up that late. \n\n>Even with people in the house, you could use a sound machine and your child would have no clue. \n\nconsidering that she wasn't expecting the uninvited after-midnight guests, and the kid being up this late was likely a one night occurrence, why would OP have a sound machine & where on earth is she going to buy one after midnight?\n\n>No excuse that they were up until 2 AM.\n\nand if it hadn't been for those uninvited guests making all the noise downstairs, the kid would have been asleep earlier.", "Yikes", "And the fact that this group of friends didn\u2019t even arrive at OP\u2019s home till midnight is ridiculous", "This.\n\n20 year olds are not \"tired kids\".

After 7 hours of driving the Husband, SIL, and Niece are still saying eat and OP comes down saying eat at the gas station. From their perspective OP does seem like an ass. \n\nShe doesn't have to host Husband and SIL can host. \n\nI also grew up in a community where drinks and food often went till 3am on the weekends.
