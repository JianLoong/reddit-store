There were about 40 people there and it really started at noon since many of the adults came to help prep the house and the food and enjoy being together. For the most part, his family is lovely and we get along well. \n\nThe party started at 6 and everyone had a good time. Around 10, people started to make their way out. By 11, the food was being put up. Close to midnight I went to give our toddler a bath and prepare him for bed while my husband and some of his family were washing the dishes and tidying up the kitchen and house. A little after midnight I heard the doorbell ring and heard unfamiliar voices and laughter.\n\nI went downstairs to discover my 20 something niece (who was still there) had invited 7 of her friends to the party (without our permission) and they were just showing up because they left their city late and underestimated the time it took to drive to our places (about 7 hours). They strolled into our house with some of them not saying anything to me and the older adults and asked my niece what was for dinner. \n\nI tried to shut it down and said that the party is over and it\u2019s after midnight. A girl in the group said that they\u2019ve been driving for so long and she doesn\u2019t want to be in the car anymore then another girl told my niece (without looking at me) that everything is closed so if they don\u2019t eat now, they won\u2019t be able to eat until morning. I pointed out the gas stations are still opened when my SIL (niece\u2019s mom) told the group she can heat up some food for them. We got into a heated discussion and I told SIL she can leave and feed them at her house. My husband led me upstairs, begged me to just let his sister feed the group, and we argued. It was almost 2 before I could get our toddler to sleep due to the noise and the smell of food coming from downstairs.\n\nToday at lunch, another SIL made a passive aggressive comment about being a good host so I told her directly that a good guest doesn\u2019t bring additional guests. That blew the lid off and we argued loudly. His entire family thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable to a group of tried and hungry kids.\nMy husband thinks it\u2019s the stress of having so many people here, that I\u2019m overreacting, and should apologize. I refuse to and feel like I\u2019m on an island by myself.

Midnight is just beyond the pale.", "You are NTA and your husband is a massive asshole for not backing you up.", "NTA. Wow the audacity of those kids to show up AFTER MIDNIGHT to a family party is mind blowing.  I don\u2019t care how long they drove.  If your SIL wanted to feed them then she needed to do it somewhere other than your house. \n\n1,000 % NTA. How unbelievably rude.", "No way, you are NTA.  Hosting a party that big means you spent all week prepping/cleaning.  Doing that with a toddler is impossible.  Then you hosted all day, and I'm sure you were exhausted.  Your husband should have taken the reigns on this, told you to go to sleep,  asked all of them to leave, and should keep his sister in check.  To be clear, I'm a husband myself, but in our case I'd be the one telling my family to gtfo, I'm tired.", "NTA.     Maybe during the 7 hour trip, thry should have stopped for food.  Find a pizza place. Dennys  is 34 hours \nThe whole family are assholes", "NTA. It's baseline rude to bring people to a party or to someone else's house uninvited, much less that late, not to mention to someone's house who has children who have gone to bed already.\n\nIt wasn't your problem how long the kids had been in the car - that would be the problem of the people who invited them to your house uninvited. And your husband was definitely out of line not having your back on this.\n\nAnd then there is your SIL making a comment at lunch the next day - bringing this up in public when there was no need to. She was trying to bring peer pressure down on you to punish and bully you for your completely reasonable reaction. And your husband, by asking you to apologize, is enabling her.\n\nDon't apologize - you have **nothing** to apologize for. It is your niece, your SIL, and your husband who need to apologize.", "NTA, they invited themselves in, didn't even okay it with anyone or even acknowledge the home owner. Now we see where niece gets her lack of manners from.", "This is an easy fix. Show up at your SIL\u2019s house, with five of your best mom friends and their kiddos at 5am next week asking for breakfast. Cause, you know, that\u2019s normal.", "NTA. Your niece and SIL are ridiculously entitled. No one is entitled to invite a mob of people you don't know over to your house at midnight and expect you to provide food for them--even if SIL did offer to prepare it. And your husband was out of line defending them. Stick to your guns on this one.", "NTA surely one of the niece\u2019s friends had a phone and could have contacted the niece and there could have been a conversation about what time they thought they were arriving and niece could have updated you and that would have been your opportunity to tell them that midnight was too late to arrive.\n\nI find it hard to believe that no texting was happening between niece and her friends during their seven hour car trip. Why didn\u2019t niece tell you that these friends were invited to the party?\n\nWhere were they planning on staying the night? We\u2019re they just going to eat and then turn around and get back in the car?", "NTA, it is very rude to invite people to a party where you are a guest. Especially a teenager! What entitlement. Next party at the IL's, invite your friends to tag along.", "None of our 20 something kids would dare do this in our house never mind someone else\u2019s house. It was extreme rude & disrespectful.
