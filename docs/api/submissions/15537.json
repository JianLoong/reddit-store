Your sister was quite the AH with this one.  You were absolutely right though:\n\nYou don't get credit for being so virtuous for not wanting anything else online but still demanding extra gifts. \n\nOh, and she should be thankful for that generous amount.  In my family, gifts are usually in the $50 range, not $250.", "NTA,\n\nYour sister is an AH though for faking the 'i only care about people donating to x and im willing to sacrifice my birthday' in public and then pulling this on you in private.", "NTA. If she wanted a birthday present it probably wasn't a wise idea to say she didn't want anything.", "So her little virtue signaling stunt on Facebook backfired and now she wants to cry about it? NTA and maybe next time she says something to you I would just point out that you believed she was being honest when she posted about not wanting gifts and wanting people to donate. So that's what you did.... Since she requested it!", "Definitely NTA.   You called it - she wants to virtue signal publicly that she is all about charity and then has a lot of nerve to demand additional gifts!   You did the right thing.", "LOL NTA you sister wants to seem altruistic online while secretly she's materialistic and wanted gifts. You are probably the only person she feels comfortable showing her real side to. She's def not hitting up other friends for presents in private.", "NTA.  You're right she is just virtue signaling.  But sometimes that comes with the risk that people will take you seriously.  \n\nPeople should be grateful for gifts but they aren't owed gifts.  Especially adults.  Next year she would get exactly zero gifts from me.", "She literally said she did not want any gifts and instead wanted money donated to charity. You made a generous donation and then she asked where her gift was? Girl, that was your gift. NTA.", "NTA. Your gift was actually very generous and exactly what she asked for. If anything, her behavior shows that she wants \u2018social credit\u2019 for donating her birthday to charity but also wants things for herself. You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want gifts except I actually want them\u201d.

And that all she wants is for everyone to donate money to this organization.\n\nNTA. Just repeat her words back to her any time she contacts you.. Donations are instead of gifts. That's the whole point, and clearly she was aware since that's what she posted.", "NTA. she virtue signaled for social media clout by acting like she cared more about people donating to a charity instead of buying her gifts, secretly hoped people would buy her gifts regardless, then gaslight you after doing exactly what she asked for. she's the AH here.", "NTA. She just discovered that virtue signalling can have real costs.", "NTA\n\nShe said that she didn't want gifts, and then she wants gifts? So what was all that charity thing about? Actually she's the one who is cheap, not you.", "NTA.", "So she wants to appear altruistic and also be materialistic. Gotcha. NTA.", "NTA. She wants her cake and eat it too.", "NTA. Your sister is a virtue-signaling hypocrite. If you say you don\u2019t want gifts, don\u2019t complain you don\u2019t get gifts.", "I personally would post screenshots or something from this so people see how of an asshole and hypocrite she is\nNTA", "Okay, NTA, But...\"donate to a charity for my birthday\" is so random friends and acquaintances don't feel the need to buy you things. Family still celebrates as they normally would. She was not clear in her expectations if she wanted family to do differently, but I would definitely have checked with her before donating $250. Checking in with her in person (text, call, zoom) would have saved a lot of frustration for both of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When virtue signaling goes wrong...\n\nNTA.", "NTA Your sister is. Either she wants donations to her charity instead of gifts or she doesn't. She can't have both ways.
