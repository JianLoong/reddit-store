I checked.\n\nI was honestly shocked and had to stop myself from suggesting we take photos without the groom then, since divorce seems such a likelihood these days, but it's completely put me off being there at all.\n\n We have a child together, we're married, never said an unkind word to each other. I see no reason to imply we would ever separate.\n\nIs this a sane ask? I've never been more than a simple wedding guest before so perhaps I am being an A?\n\nTL,DR: Little sister asked we take photos for wedding album where my husband specifially doesn't appear, I don't want to go to the wedding.\n\nEDIT/update: Thank you all for responding. I've decided to attend and will see what her intentions are on the spot and if she's specifically singling out my partner. That way, if she is, I can call her out in front of everyone.

You and your husband are a package deal in any family photo because he is your family. This of course assumes that she has no reason to ask this and is just an idiot making stupid requests.\n\nIf, however, she's asking this for a reason, it becomes a bit more complicated. Does she know something you don't? This could be as simple as seeing your husband with another woman and misconstruing what it meant, or actually catching him doing something wrong, or maybe she had a bad interaction with him and doesn't like him as a result, or... the list could go on. \n\nDefinitely have a conversation explaining that she owes you an apology for making such a ridiculous request and that you will not be taking any pictures without your husband in a family setting.

I wouldn't.", "NTA Very weird request. Wedding photos commemorate a certain event at a certain point in time.

Her husband is the father of her kid, of the brides niece/ nephew even if he was no longer a husband.", "Yes this makes no sense. Is your husband super hot?

My sister and I are both no longer with the man she married at her wedding or the man I was with then (she generously invited my then boyfriend of 3 months into a few photos, we ended up together for a decade so). We unintentionally were in the center of the photo so you could crop out the guys if you wanted to but I can\u2019t begin to tell you how no one really cares about her wedding photos.

HOWEVER, as you pointed out yourself, it goes both ways. She might divorce her husband, possibly. By that logic, why even celebrate weddings? Why marry at all? It's possibly not forever!\n\nNTA. Your sister is giving an excuse. She doesn't like your husband for some reason.", "NTA, while divorce is something that can\u2019t always be predicted - it does not have to end badly. Like you said, he is the father of your kid and should always be considered a part of the family either way (except for if he shows violence to you or your kid, but it doesn\u2019t seem like he has shown tendencies of that).\nIf that is her demands, then she should do that with all couples LOL.", "I think basically she is very disrespectful.

Lots of people split up, that\u2019s life. I, myself got married in 1997 and my sister was my MOH. Her long term partner was in the photos, as was his son. They split up within a year of the wedding. It didn\u2019t make a difference because my photo album isn\u2019t constantly on display; it\u2019s in a box in the attic. The only photo on display is one of me and my husband. She\u2019s being ridiculous and I\u2019d bite back on it, it\u2019s insulting to you.\n\nOnly time I\u2019ve ever done anything similar was when my daughter had her prom photos done and I wanted one without her then bf.

If not, then I\u2019d at least remove myself from the wedding party and perhaps not attend altogether.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s just my thoughts as someone completely outside the situation.

You are not obligated to do so. \n\nThis may not be about your husband. It may be about you. She sounds bitter & jealous. It seems like she wants to hurt you. How has your relationship been with your sister over the years? Is she your only sibling? Has your parents treated you & your sister differently?

Who does that?", "NTA. That's a normal request for a partner of less than like 6-8 months. Not a spouse who you have built a family with. Does she know something about him you don't?

Does she think she knows something you don\u2019t? Was this her way to try and start to talk about something she thinks is up with your husband (albeit in a very cowardly way)? \n\nIt\u2019s highly likely she\u2019s incredibly wrong but I would want to sit her down, face to face, and have the direct conversation with her - what\u2019s caused her to say this.", "Hmm.

Best course of action is to talk to her directly and tell her you were hurt by what she said- give her an opportunity to take it back or explain better what she meant by that comment.

They both ended up divorced 10 years later.  There was a lot of anger towards the ex-husbands at the time and I wished there was a way to erase them from the pictures (this was long before Photoshop).

Or maybe it's her \"very strong opinions\" that leads her to think \"she sure knows how to pick'em\" about you, and expect the worst.", "Just telling you my first impression from reading your post. Trust your gut.", "Fuck off and die", "Well there you go...that sounds like it might be the missing in your sisters nasty request.", "Okay I was going to ask if it was race related, that\u2019s the only thing that made sense to me. I thought it was maybe just plain racism, but please feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong!", "That's unhinged tbh. It frightens me how so many supposedly normal women just come out with such bizarre ideas.", "I don't know about OP's family, but I think my entire family would lose their shit on the bride if she tried this sort of thing. Well, less drama. Just a \"no, this is not happening\". So bizarre to me anybody would stand there and accept such exclusionary behaviour", "She replied that her husband was the only person that was to step out.", "She stated that it\u2019s specifically ONLY her husband bring asked to step out. No one else.", "OP says in the post that she DID ask and the sister doesn't mean bridesmaids only, blood only or girls only. Sister literally means \"the same picture as before but now specifically without OP's husband\".", "Then she should just not go. No need to go there and cause a scene, it's not worth it.", "Was she upset about not being invited to the courthouse wedding? That could potentially be a factor", "So that\u2019s not it.  I was hoping there wasn\u2019t some disability/race reason that he might not be welcome in photos.  Unfortunately, I\u2019ve borne witness to such a scenario before.", "Is the groom insecure about his height?", "I did end up reading a bunch of other comments. The reason she wants pics w/o him is 100000% because he's more attractive than the groom and she doesn't want the groom to be \"outshined.\" So she's just being really shallow and probably assumes that in thr future some random friends/strangers are going to see her wedding photos and be like \"omg who's yhat tall handsome guy thats not the groom??\"", "And green hair. Nothing gets dated like hair.", "that is soooo great,i love it!!! green screens with green suits :-D hahaha great idea! :-))))", "But the sister WASN'T asking for blood only. She was specifically only asking for pictures without op's husband.", "Disagree photos are family - all family, friends. Or both family and friends. Total AH thing to say relations by marriage aren\u2019t family - they are the very definition of family.", "[removed]", "ok, WOW. my parents separated in their 50s but i gotta say 90/94 is some next level shit.", "Dang.", "Dang!! Both were in the long con but time is the winner!", "John : [to dead alligator]  You're luggage!", "Somewhere out there, Loki and Mobius are waiting", "Darkest timeline: they return to the wedding, Back to the Future style - play the guitar and run off with the potential groom.", "A can of wormholes, perhaps?\n\n\nOP is definitely NTA if it's just her husband being singled out. If it's all spouses, then fine ...", "Have him dress like the bridesmaids. Then it\u2019s even WEIRDER that she leaves him out!!", "I quote \"it is the safe way to take photos\"", "OP needs to answer this because the entire ruling kind of depends on it", "That\u2019s what I want to know. She might just want a photo with only her parents and siblings (no partners for everyone), with only the bridesmaids as well. If it\u2019s only op\u2019s husband, that\u2019s weird", "Provocate? 0.o; You meant provoke, right? Sorry, I did a bit of a double take there, and just want to be sure that's what you did mean.", "Second, maybe. As we met abroad and he's not american, first one is impossible. \n\nPerhaps there is a grudge in the whole family about him and she's just the only one sharing the sentiment, I don't know!", "That seems a bit extreme, but ok.", "It had not crossed my mind. Frankly, jealousy is something I'd faster assume than racism", "I mean while we're different cultures, my man is paler than I am so safe to say not", "I never said she wasn't invited, though?", "That's horrible and superficial. It amazes me how so many horrible people end up finding spouses!", "Not something I've asked him lol but he seems a fairly balanced person", "A couple of years ago there was a mother who send her daughter to school on picture day in a lovely green sweater. The pictures were taken in front of a green screen and then various backgrounds were projected on the green screen. The daughter blended in very nicely\ud83e\udd23", "Op's sis is so hung up on her perfect weeding( No not a error, that's what this has become) that she is forgetting that other people have their own feelings", "What BS! She\u2019s outright disrespectful of your marriage. That\u2019s shitty of her. Tell her you\u2019ll step out of the photos where your hubby isn\u2019t beside you", "Your sister's mindset is ridiculous. N T A. \nToday, it is super easy to photoshop people out of photos anyway, so her pathetic request isn't even needed.", "I\u2019m going to be honest. She sounds like either she is sleeping with your husband or knows someone who is and if that is not the case she is really out of line (I mean she is out of line in all cases)", "Oh, he's not American? Does he by any chance look different from you and your family? (Aka, is he not white?)\n\nI'm gonna go with \"your sister is racist and doesn't want people who look too different in her wedding photos.\" Or \"she's racist and thinks he's going to cheat by virtue of his culture. \"\n\nYour sister is probably just being a covert racist", "Maybe she thinks he sees you less as his soulmate and more as his Green card?", "He\u2019s he the only partner that she doesn\u2019t want in pictures?", "I was going to ask a similar question regarding appearance but not race, necessarily. Does your husband have any kind of visible disability or unusual physical feature? My gut tells me that perhaps the sister came up with the potential split excuse (which doesn't make any sense to me and is a pretty absurd request) because she doesn't like something about the way your husband looks.", "Its perhaps me officially being on reddit too long, but when there are random or bizarre conflicts like this that make no logical sense on the surface...9 times out of 10 there is a different culture and/or skin tone involved. You could be right that its jealousy, although WHY? Shes literally getting married! But knowing hes a different culture and then looking at the \"just in case\" comments...its not a good logical explanation, in fact its shitty as hell, but it IS logical.\n\nThe only way to know for sure is to pin her down on the \"just in case\" and the \"only safe way to take photos\" comments. Make her explain them.", "Could be both", "Ah OK fair. Do you have other siblings? Are their partners allowed to be in pictures? Do the bridesmaids have partners? Is she doing bridesmaid only photos and then just kicking your husband out of photos?", "Is sister ashamed of groom's height?", " really? that sounds soooo funny!!! i wish i could be the photographer,that is a once in a lifetime chance to make greaaaat pictures xD", "but why would you even want to? Maybe if it was some uber-traumatic breakup you might not want them, but the wedding photo is a snapshot of the makeup of the family at the time it was taken. So odd", "We're all crackers but he's probably the whitest and blue eyed", "That's wild. Would be weird though as my sister is not a big fan of the US and wants to move abroad herself (as do we)", "It was amazing. I am trying to find that post. She blended into the forest, the milky way and the ocean for example.\n\nEta: found the story and remembered wrong; it was a boy. Still funny though https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/7th-grader-blends-into-green-screen-for-school-pictures-hilarity/", "Maybe someone who'll be at the wedding has a history with your husband? Maybe it's a religion thing? Maybe your sister is hoping to set you up with someone else? \n\nThe possibilities are endless, specially if you include petty and/or stupid reasons.", "the gender doesnt matter :-D \n\nohhh THANK YOU that is soooo great,i love it :-D the forrest and the floating head xD or the flag,its sooo great!!!", "Thanks for the link.  That was awesome"]}
