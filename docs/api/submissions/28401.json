I checked.\n\nI was honestly shocked and had to stop myself from suggesting we take photos without the groom then, since divorce seems such a likelihood these days, but it's completely put me off being there at all.\n\n We have a child together, we're married, never said an unkind word to each other. I see no reason to imply we would ever separate.\n\nIs this a sane ask? I've never been more than a simple wedding guest before so perhaps I am being an A?\n\nTL,DR: Little sister asked we take photos for wedding album where my husband specifially doesn't appear, I don't want to go to the wedding.\n\nEDIT/update: Thank you all for responding. I've decided to attend and will see what her intentions are on the spot and if she's specifically singling out my partner. That way, if she is, I can call her out in front of everyone.

You and your husband are a package deal in any family photo because he is your family. This of course assumes that she has no reason to ask this and is just an idiot making stupid requests.\n\nIf, however, she's asking this for a reason, it becomes a bit more complicated. Does she know something you don't? This could be as simple as seeing your husband with another woman and misconstruing what it meant, or actually catching him doing something wrong, or maybe she had a bad interaction with him and doesn't like him as a result, or... the list could go on. \n\nDefinitely have a conversation explaining that she owes you an apology for making such a ridiculous request and that you will not be taking any pictures without your husband in a family setting.

Please stand up for your husband and your relationship (either both of you are in picture or none)\n\n\nIt is a really strange request especially if you say you have a good relationship with your husband and never complain to her about him.

That\u2019s what wedding photos are, a snapshot in time that honestly no one really looks at once the wedding is over. And why pick on your husband? She could get divorced herself.

I wouldn't.", "NTA Very weird request. Wedding photos commemorate a certain event at a certain point in time. Of course as time goes on people will change, couples will perhaps separate, some will eventually die.

Her husband is the father of her kid, of the brides niece/ nephew even if he was no longer a husband.", "Yes this makes no sense. Is your husband super hot?

It is a really odd thing to ask. Does that request apply to every significant other of the other people who would be in the photos, or is it just him?  \nIf it's for everyone, sure, it's still odd, but fine. If he's the only one excluded like that, I would take that as an insult as well, and I would tell her what's on my mind, consequences be damned.", "It\u2019s absolutely ok to have  different group photos.

I would have to ask her why she is only requesting this if you?", "Bizarre. My sister and I are both no longer with the man she married at her wedding or the man I was with then (she generously invited my then boyfriend of 3 months into a few photos, we ended up together for a decade so). We unintentionally were in the center of the photo so you could crop out the guys if you wanted to but I can\u2019t begin to tell you how no one really cares about her wedding photos. Even if they were still married. It\u2019s a weird request. That\u2019s for sure.", "The pictures are a moment in time. At this moment you're with your husband.

HOWEVER, as you pointed out yourself, it goes both ways. She might divorce her husband, possibly. By that logic, why even celebrate weddings? Why marry at all? It's possibly not forever!\n\nNTA. Your sister is giving an excuse. She doesn't like your husband for some reason.", "NTA, while divorce is something that can\u2019t always be predicted - it does not have to end badly. Like you said, he is the father of your kid and should always be considered a part of the family either way (except for if he shows violence to you or your kid, but it doesn\u2019t seem like he has shown tendencies of that).\nIf that is her demands, then she should do that with all couples LOL.", "I think basically she is very disrespectful.

Lots of people split up, that\u2019s life. I, myself got married in 1997 and my sister was my MOH. Her long term partner was in the photos, as was his son. They split up within a year of the wedding. It didn\u2019t make a difference because my photo album isn\u2019t constantly on display; it\u2019s in a box in the attic. The only photo on display is one of me and my husband. She\u2019s being ridiculous and I\u2019d bite back on it, it\u2019s insulting to you.\n\nOnly time I\u2019ve ever done anything similar was when my daughter had her prom photos done and I wanted one without her then bf. Just in case. They were only 16.

If not, then I\u2019d at least remove myself from the wedding party and perhaps not attend altogether.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s just my thoughts as someone completely outside the situation.

When planning out her pictures she could have just discreetly made a list of all the arrangements like \u201csisters with our parents\u201d, \u201cwedding party only\u201d cousins minus spouses and children, cousins with spouses and children\u2026 \n\nIf she really doesn\u2019t want him in any pictures then you\u2019re absolutely right to back out of the wedding. What a weird ask.", "NTA especially because you have a child together.

I would ask this of my sister as she goes through guys like you wouldn\u2019t believe and she always throws a fit if pictures of her and ex come up after they have broken up but in your case your married and have been for quite some time and have a child as well. Your sister is definitely out of line.

You are not obligated to do so. \n\nThis may not be about your husband. It may be about you. She sounds bitter & jealous. It seems like she wants to hurt you. How has your relationship been with your sister over the years? Is she your only sibling? Has your parents treated you & your sister differently?

I am the middle of five children. \n\nI am 55. She is 60. I have been NC with her more often than not in my adult life because of her abusive behavior towards me.

Who does that?", "NTA. That's a normal request for a partner of less than like 6-8 months. Not a spouse who you have built a family with. Does she know something about him you don't?

Does she think she knows something you don\u2019t? Was this her way to try and start to talk about something she thinks is up with your husband (albeit in a very cowardly way)? \n\nIt\u2019s highly likely she\u2019s incredibly wrong but I would want to sit her down, face to face, and have the direct conversation with her - what\u2019s caused her to say this.", "Hmm.

Best course of action is to talk to her directly and tell her you were hurt by what she said- give her an opportunity to take it back or explain better what she meant by that comment. It may have been a bad joke and if not it at least gives you an opportunity to educate her on the weight of her words and how to treat people. \nIt sucks to have to be the bigger person when someone else has been a dick, but it\u2019s part of life and how we all learn- we\u2019ve all said shitty stuff before", "I\u2019m sure my SIL would agree with your sister as she now has to see her exhusband when we go thru my wedding photos.

They both ended up divorced 10 years later.  There was a lot of anger towards the ex-husbands at the time and I wished there was a way to erase them from the pictures (this was long before Photoshop).
