I had asked him if I could give my daughter his last name and my only reasoning I had come up with was that I wanted both of my kids to have the same last name. My ex, being an awesome friend, said he wanted me to really think on it before he said yes. He made better points than my one point.

You are navigating a very complicated issue with far more grace and maturity than I had at 16. \n\nI think you should consider doing a few things:\n\n**1.** First, if you haven\u2019t yet, tell your mom exactly what is going on. Be very clear about the things your dad has been saying to you and the situation that just happened with Ellie being pulled into it.\n\nAsk your mom for her help and intervention. \n\n**2.** Secondly, put up boundaries with your dad and any relatives (aunts, uncles, grandparents) who are trying to pressure you and manipulate you.\n\nTake a page from your mom\u2019s book: \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence. \n\nSo is, \u201cI\u2019m not talking about this anymore with you. If you don\u2019t drop it, then I\u2019m not staying here to get pressured more. I\u2019m leaving/calling Mom to pick me up/hanging up the phone/ignoring your texts.\u201d\n\nAnd then follow through.\n\nIt\u2019ll be uncomfortable at first, and expect a backlash at the beginning. But the more you do it, the easier it gets. Stating and upholding boundaries is an important life skill to learn.\n\nThey\u2019ll either learn to leave you alone about it, or you\u2019ll remove yourself from their manipulation and pressure. Win-win.\n\n**3.** *(Note: This next part is not your responsibility, so don\u2019t feel obligated. You are not the parent. But as someone who grew up in a similarly challenging household, I understand as much as that\u2019s true, sometimes you\u2019re forced into positions that are not ideal and you\u2019re just trying to make the best of a bad situation.)*\n\nFinally - and only if you *want* to - find a time when your dad\u2019s not present to have a heart to heart with Ellie. You can speak to Tommy separately as well, but Ellie is the priority (since your dad seems to be roping her in more than Tommy). \n\n1:1 conversations might allow them to listen and speak more freely about how they\u2019re truly feeling without fear of what their other sibling might think.\n\nNow, since Ellie\u2019s been entrenched in your dad\u2019s bullshit, she probably won\u2019t be receptive to you telling her about the situation as you have been. \n\nInstead, I\u2019d suggest looking up a technique called Motivational Interviewing. It\u2019s used a lot by therapists and coaches with clients who are resistant to change, but it\u2019s a useful skill for anyone to know.\n\nThe heart of MI is getting through to the other person by asking open ended questions, making them feel truly listened to and understood through affirmations and reflective listening skills. \n\nIn your situation, instead of just directly telling Ellie things, you\u2019re giving her a safe space to express how she\u2019s thinking and feeling about things. You\u2019re building the connection to a point where she\u2019ll be more open and receptive to listening to you.\n\nHere\u2019s [an article explaining the parts of Motivational Interviewing](https://positivepsychology.com/motivational-interviewing/) and here\u2019s [a thorough guide to Motivational Interviewing with examples of questions, affirmations, etc.](https://www.jcjc.pa.gov/Publications/Documents/JJSES/Motivational%20Interviewing%20Workbook.pdf).
