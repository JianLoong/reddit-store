If he wanted a mother for them, he had plenty of time looking for another lady after his second wife died... But don't expect your ex to fill in that void.\nEta: NTA", "Right?? My mind is blown by the audacity of this man and his side of the family to expect that of OP\u2019s mom after the stuff he did. What a selfish, ridiculous man he is. NTA OP", "Ya it\u2019s pretty sad that your dad is trying to absolve himself of guilt and responsibility by pushing a role onto your mom that she has no business In", "You may need to tell your Dad and your family to stop pushing it or you will explain to the Kids exactly why your Mom wants nothing to do with them. What him and his family are doing is not healthy for anyone and it needs to stop. NTA", "Then he needs to step up and realize that he is the only sole parent. Easier said than done", "Plus it sounds like his parents agree with him that OPs mom needs to step in.  Which is crazy.", "Gross. They don't get a vote. And seem to be delusional", "So they expected her to either forgive him or just put up with it???", "I'm shocked they he hasn't tried to get you to help out", "He was banking on side chick to raise them. Now he has to and realizes he's screwed.", "I feel sorry for the kids who have no fault they are the result of their father's affair,", "[removed]", "THIS is the way. It is a bit harsh but your dad is trying to pass off the responsibility of parenting to your mom who has no obligation to even welcome them into her life after the betrayal she experienced from your dad. Granted, EVERYONE here needs therapy including your mom, but that doesn\u2019t make your or her feelings less valid. \n\nTell your father you will let them know what\u2019s up if he doesn\u2019t sit them down to explain to them and if he doesn\u2019t stop HARASSING your mom so you can save them from living the rest of their lives in a world of hurt and feeling abandoned and unwanted BY SOMEONE WHO DOESN\u2019T OWE THEM ANYTHING especially as a result of your DAD\u2019s infidelity. \n\nI absolutely love that you are backing her up and standing up for your mom even when she isn\u2019t there. If you don\u2019t sit them down and set things straight, they could potentially view your mother as a \u201cvillain\u201c in their head and blame her for all of their sufferings as she would be an easy scapegoat since your dad is all they have and they see him trying not only to provide for them BUT also trying to his best to convince a \u2018heartless\u2019 woman to take them in as her own (but they don\u2019t know this being as young as they are so they will just internalize it as a result and resent her forever\u2026), not to mention the fact that literally EVERYONE on your dad\u2019s side already keeps reinforcing the thought in their head that your mom SHOULD take them in as if she is obligated to and is refusing to just because.", "[removed]", "I would strongly recommend against this. This will only increase the poor stepsiblings trauma. They\u2019ll find out one day. They have enough issues currently, today does not need to be that day. They\u2019re 11 and 9! \n\nMaking empty threats always backfires. Also do not recommend. \n\nI would have firmer boundaries with your dad by saying the constant asks and pressures are not fair on you and really detract from quality time. You\u2019d like to start spending less time with him until he can pull himself together. Talk to your mum. School counselor. Seek other support. Threatening to tell children will just be provocative.", "Good advice!\n\nPlus, two more years and OP will probably go LC/NC with Dad and grandparents if they continue being unreasonable", "well said. this is what it boils down to and this is what OP\u2019s dad needs to hear to be honest", "He only wants her back to dump the kids. When he finds a new side piece he'll leave.", "Comment stolen from u/lianavan.", "The mom seems like she's already been therapy. She even knows to set boundaries. She says no and does not explain why not. She doesn't bad mouth the ex. She just minds her business.", "Comment stolen from u/AusLiBossy.", "I'm actually surprised he hasn't found one already unless everybody hears about what he did to OP's mom early on and said \"No thanks!\"", "That\u2019ll teach me to read and respond in the middle of the night. I appreciate the correction and have edited."]}
