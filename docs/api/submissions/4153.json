My dad had an affair with Kate and mom and him divorced. Ellie (11f) was the result of the affair and Tommy (9m) was born when dad married Kate. A year later Kate died. My dad's family rallied around my half siblings and tried to make up for the loss of their mother. My mom shared custody of me and my brother with my dad. He had asked her to include Ellie and Tommy in her life after Kate died, and even told my brother and I a few times that they would be coming to mom's with us and she'd be their mom now too. My mom never did take Ellie or Tommy into her home. I don't even think she's ever interacted with them. When I look back at moments where everyone was present, she was always one side with her family and dad was another with his and my half siblings.\n\nEllie and Tommy as they have gotten bigger have expressed all the emotions you might when you don't have a mom but you sometimes share a home with kids who do. They get jealous, sad, frustrated, they have asked for us to share mom with them, they have wanted to come along when they hear mom is taking us on vacation. They have wanted us to all spend Christmas together. All kinds of stuff. They also have just dad's side of the family since none of Kate's want to be in their lives. But we have both sets of grandparents and aunts and uncles involved in our lives.\n\nA few times over the years dad, or my grandma or uncle have asked me if I don't dislike that my mom wouldn't open her heart to kids who are part of my family. I always said no, because they are not her kids and so, it doesn't make sense to me that she would.\n\nMy dad wanted to try and get my half siblings wish to come true for a Christmas where we're all together, which would include my brother and I and our mom. Mom said no. She did not engage with him beyond her no. Ellie and dad then tried to get me to talk mom around and I said no and I told them I did not want to talk her around. Ellie got upset hearing that and left. Dad and my grandparents then cornered me later and asked me how can I say that when I know Ellie and Tommy feel left out and that they crave mothering. I told them I don't care if they feel left out because it's not my mom's job to mother them and I would never expect her to do it and since one can't be fixed without the other thing happening ie, them feeling left out can't be fixed unless they feel like they now have a mom in my mom, then I realize it's not going to happen. They told me my mom could, and should, have love for them as her children's siblings. I told them dad should have thought about that before he cheated on her and got another woman pregnant while he was still married to mom.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670406022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zex01o/aita_for_saying_i_dont_care_if_my_half_siblings/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope they stop soon otherwise they really are going to damage your relationship with one another.", "NTA your dad is for sure and he's trying really hard to make his poor decisions everyone else's responsibility to help with. Your mom has 0 obligation to the kids he had with someone else. The audacity for him to even ask after his actions that led to the divorce is insane.  \"Hey I know I cheated on you, destroyed the marriage, had a kid while still married to you but I really need you to be a mother for these kids even though they are a constant reminder of my infidelity and have no connection to you beyond that\"", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m so just wow when people *expect* the cheated on spouse to take in the affair partner\u2019s children.", "NTA.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, any kid in this situation would miss that motherly love and would probably look for it in other people, but the level it\u2019s at, and especially the insistence for it to be this woman who\u2019s never interacted with them just screams to me that they were manipulated to feel this way. Clearly dad doesn\u2019t care who\u2019s hearts to break to get with whatever women he wants at the time. NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not the kids\u2019 fault, however your dad is selfish, entitled and delusional. The fact he thinks that your mum will want to \u201cmother\u201d his love children is barbaric.

If real this is so clearly NTA.  He cheated on his wife. He married the affair partner. Affair partner is out of the picture either through health or death reasons. Well, health and death can be closely related. Anyway, then ex husband wants ex wife to be mom to new kids. Stop weaponizing kids to get your way in life.", "NTA. Your mother has no responsibility around your siblings and the tale your dad and his family invented of her becoming their mother figure is never happening. It\u2019s unfortunate that their mother died, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact. If your dad want to give them a mother that much, he should be looking for a partner already. That\u2019s the only way it could happen. They should leave your mother alone.\n\nYour family includes both set of grandparents, mother and father and siblings.

Your father is an asshole truly he cheated and married the other woman but now she\u2019s dead and he expects his ex to mother the kids that he had with the other woman. Even worse he filled those kids heads up with bullshit that your mom is supposed to be responsible for them now. The audacity of some men. Those kids aren\u2019t her responsibility. Why would your mom want a constant reminder of his betrayal, his disloyalty to her in her house?", "NTA. What is it with people expecting their ex's to co-parent kids they've had with someone else? It sucks that Kate died, but that's neither yours nor your mother's fault, and your mother is certainly not obligated to be a surrogate mom to these kids, and your father giving them false hopes that your mother would accept them as hers is just plain cruel. Your mom is obviously still harboring a deep resentment against your father, and his antics are just making things worse. He made his choice a long time ago. He gets to live with it.", "NTA\n\nSo is your dad still considered the golden child to your grandparents?  Because HE created this mess and your mom is under NO obligation to take any of your half siblings in\n\nMaybe your grandparents should actually make their son face consequences for once\n\nLook it\u2019s not the kids fault and I do feel sorry for them but again your dad created all this mess and his way of trying to repair it all is just wrong and speaks more towards his ego as opposed to actually caring about all involved", "NTA but they sure are for trying to pressure a woman who has nothing to do with them and who was cheated on into mothering the result of said infedelity. They are also AH for trying to make a kid convince a grown woman to take on children who 1 aren't hers and 2. are specifically a reminder of her husbands cheating. You are fully in the right. The idc was maybe a little harsh but that's it.", "NTA. They aren\u2019t her kids, they are her exs affair baby and sibling, so she shouldn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t care for them. Good on you for keeping positive boundaries", "NTA. Let your dad read this post. He fucked up and now wants everyone around him to pick up after his mistakes. Nope. Can you stay with your mom full time?", "NTA. Your dad has set them up for this disappointment by leading them to believe she should be in their lives; he needs to instead spend his energy helping them accept reality.", "NTA /you are correct", "It is not your or your mother's fault that your half siblings have an asshole for a father. He can't break up a family and then expect his ex wife to fix his life when it doesn't work out without her. You and your mother don't owe him anything. NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019d bet that your dad wants to get back together with your mom now and have everyone play happy family now. Your mom has absolutely no obligation to anyone but you and your older brother. No way does she need to play mommy to your dads other kids.", "NTA. It\u2019s obviously not the kids fault but why on earth would the wronged party in an affair baby situation be responsible for anything to do with them?

But there\u2019s no need for you to hammer them with it so bluntly. You could guide them to a gentler understanding instead of making them feel like they are bad kids because their parents are bad people.\n\nYour dad shouldn\u2019t be pushing it, of course. If he wants a mom for them he should find a woman to date who is willing to assume that role (or a guy to be their second dad if he\u2019s bi).\n\nBut yes, you\u2019re an asshole to your brother and sister who have done nothing wrong but suffer a horrible loss and struggle with it.", "I don't think either of those things will happen since my dad is the only parent they have left.", "This right here.\n\nNTA", "Affair or not, it's wackadoo to think that your ex should somehow mother the children that you fathered with another woman.  Even if they divorced amicably and then he met the mother of his other kids it'd still be a wild request.", "I don't think dad cares about getting back at mom as long as he has someone else taking care of all four of his kids. It makes him look less like an asshole, because how good does it look if they can get along so well after everything that when his wife dies, his ex and mother of his older kids steps up to raise the younger ones with him.", "Oh yeah, I have no doubt about that at all.

My bad lol.", "Your mom seems like an incredible woman, and your dad\u2019s family seems like straight-up trash tbh.
