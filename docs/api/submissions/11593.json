Our venue has a strict guest limit so my fianc\u00e9 and I created rules about who would be invited. We want the guests to be people who are part of our lives and support us. We made the wedding 18+ only and the only plus ones invited are serious relationships, engaged couples, and married couples. We sent out the invitations two weeks ago and have had only three people say they can\u2019t make it. \n\nMy sister found out and asked if she could invite some friends to take their places. I said I didn\u2019t want strangers at my wedding and mentioned that she will have her boyfriend and our parents and sister there. She got pissed and said it\u2019s not fair that she is 6 years younger and won\u2019t know many people and threw out that her bf will be alone in his age group during dinner (he will be sitting with my parents and they talk all the time, even without my sister.) \n\nShe gave me the \u201cbut I\u2019m your sister\u201d card too.

Are you even going to notice on the day?  I hope not.... you have other things to do than worry about a couple friends for your sister.  As long as these aren't rowdy people I'm not seeing why it even matters. There will be oodles of people you won't even talk to at your wedding because you'll be a little busy.

Weddings are expensive! Don\u2019t cater to people you don\u2019t know! I\u2019ve been to plenty of weddings where I\u2019m the youngest or don\u2019t have friends.

She is 21 years, she can work.", "I don't disagree but this could stop the whining that will inevitably happen from her sister up to and after the wedding day.

It's not a house party, it's a wedding. \nNTA.", "NTA but if I were you, i would personally take the money to cover the seats, just to not waste any more time on this non-issue.

If it's so important for your sister to get together with her friends she can do it outside your wedding.", "NTA.\n\nYou get to choose who comes since it's your wedding.

I would never be selfish enough to make my sisters wedding day be about me and how much fun i\u2019m having. I would have an amazing time being able to share that moment with my boyfriend and family and witness such a big moment in her life. I\u2019m 21 as well but your sisters mindset is very childish and selfish. Your mom is wrong by asking you to compromise in anyway. She should have your back and tell your sister to stop making it about her. Have a fantastic wedding and hopefully it\u2019s a joyous occasion !", "NTA. Let her (and your mom) know that you're the bride, not your sister or your mom. YOU (and your fiance) decide who goes your YOUR wedding. Don't give in! Best of luck!", "NTA - Your wedding, your call", "Nta \n\nYou got sisters acting like an entitled brat and your mother is enabling that", "NTA.   \nIt\u2019s your wedding, not her party. She, and her bf, will survive talking to older people for a few hours.", "NTA, your sister is being a brat and your Mom is being a spineless waffle. No one ever gets to bring their own clique to someone else\u2019s wedding just to have people to talk to. This\u2019ll never happen in the history of ever, and your Mom should be teaching your little sister how things work in the real world and not caving to her childish demands. Your wedding is about you and your SO being surrounded by people who love you and want to celebrate this milestone in your life. Your sister\u2019s friends are obviously not those people thus do not belong at your wedding."]}
