For some reason, this guy seems completely opposed to asking anyone for help. \n\nStealing a car is a massive risk to take in a medical emergency and irresponsible. Anyone blaming you for calling cops after your vehicle was stolen is reacting more in sympathy for his wife than with regard to your action.

To my knowledge those are usually kept in the garage, or in a locked shed?\n\n2) Does Jack have a history of car issues? Because while I do understand that some factors, like chilliness can run a battery down and make it not start, I feel like those issues are far and few between. And the odds of it happening specifically on the night his wife went into labor is very close to, I'd think, one in a million.  If it was a non-battery related, non-cold weather related issue, then he probably knew about the car creeping towards failing to start for some time before, and yet took no steps to remedy the situation prior to his kid's birth. And if neither of those options are true, then he must've lied...meaning there are no issues with starting the car. And...if I were you...I'd frankly think about pressing charges if he lied about this, or at least make him go to a mandated therapy and/or go on meds made for pathological liars.\n\n3) Why didn't he call 911...or even call an Uber or a Lyft, etc., if the sirens from calling 911 and receiving an ambulance, etc. were the issue and he didn't want to wake ya'll up?", "Wouldn't it have been quicker to knock on your door and ask for your keys or ask you to drive them, instead of hot wiring?", "NTA\n\nWTF", "NTA.

The anger is mostly stemming from the fact that his wife ended up giving birth in my car due to the delay. People believe it was an emergency situation and that I should have understood and forgiven Jack's actions considering the circumstances.\n\nAs for the hotwiring, Jack used to be a mechanic and has a lot of experience with older car models like mine. I can't say how long it took him exactly, but given his background, he likely managed to do it faster than the average person. Still, I agree that it's not an ideal or quick solution for a situation as urgent as a woman in labor, which adds to my frustration over his choice to cross this boundary", "Sorry, I cannot believe a story where the police recovered a stolen vehicle.", "Perfect answer", "Agreed.", "Also, despite what TV has told us, a woman who goes into labor doesn't need to be rushed to the hospital at top speed.

I'm not going to crucify the guy for making a snap decision in a desperate moment to take matters into his own hands rather than banking on being able to wake up his neighbors at 3 AM and get their permission and their keys quickly.  Valid judgement call on his part, assuming he knows that he can hotwire the car quickly.  But when other people don't know the situation and see you doing it, you might get the cops called on you.", "Borrowing means there's permission. There was none.  It's stealing, and that's not something that can be justified. He should still be held responsible.", "That's called \"conventional morality,\" which is morality for 10 year olds.  In a serious situation like this, permission is not the most important factor.  If the car was just there with the key in the driver's side door lock and OP was out of town, it wouldn't even be a moral question.  He should take the car.\n\nFurthermore, the definition of \"stealing\" states that there must be no intent to return the item.  So it was definitionally not stealing.  Obviously, we can see why OP might have suspected that someone was stealing his car, so we can't blame him for reacting accordingly, but that has nothing to do with judging the morality of the neighbor after-the-fact.", "This is absurd.", "LMFAO he had a personal emergency, so he stole something that didn't belong to him. It doesn't matter if he meant to keep it or not. He forcefully deprived the OP of the possession of his property. Hotwiring means he also damaged that vehicle, which he should also pay to repair, after he's finished with prosecution.", "Ooooh! Time to go to the local car dealer and borrow a car maybe at 3am. I promise I'll return it.", "tbf this whole posy is absurd", "Giving birth in a vehicle is guaranteed to have made an expensive mess as well. Ambulances exist for medical emergencies.", "It matters according to the dictionary.  He should absolutely pay for the damage, or repair it if he's able, but morality for grown-ups is about  harm reduction, not just \"stealing bad\" (especially when it wasn't stealing).  And the potential harm of not getting his wife to the hospital is far greater than the harm of not waking your neighbor up in the middle of the night to say \"pretty please can I borrow your car so my wife and child have a much better chance of surviving?\"  Because even if he had said no (which would be morally heinous), borrowing the car without permission would be the moral thing to do if there was no other means of getting his wife to the hospital on time.", ">if he had said no (which would be morally heinous) \n\nDude, you really think people are entitled to just take from others because of their own emergencies??? \nI can see driving them, or him lending the car, as being the kind thing to do. But nobody is entitled to take what doesn't belong to them. Again, I hope he gets every consequence due.", "That's what 911 is for. There's literally no way you are going to convince me not to press charges and file a claim for the damage. Especially when it's someone who has a history of doing what they want with someone else's property. If 911 was not an option, he should have knocked. He decided to take, without asking. And that had better come with serious consequences.", "Yes, absolutely.  And the law agrees with me.\n\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/necessity_defense\n\nFrankly, I don't know why people participate in this sub if not to actually engage with moral dilemmas in any meaningful way.", "There won't be legal consequences.
