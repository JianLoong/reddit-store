Mark has graduated college, and Chole is my twin and is also in college at a different university.\n\nRelevant Details:\n\nPrior to my parents getting divorced, my parents had made a college fund. Upon their divorce, I was a minor so my Dad took control of the college funds for me and my siblings. My Dad claims to have donated significantly more than my mom to the college fund before they got divorced but we are given no access to any of the information about the accounts. My Dad has since gotten re-married and has two new kids both under the age of 10. It is also relevant to note that my parents would not be financially burdened by the costs mentioned below.\n\nCurrently:\n\nMy Dad is a smart guy and when his parents died he set aside a portion of his inheritance into funding my and my sibling's educations. My Dad decided that he would disperse $5000 to each of his children each quarter they are at school for up to 12 quarters. Mark was given $5000 each quarter over the course of 12 quarters totaling 60 grand and Chloe is on a steady track to graduate in 12 quarters which would also total 60 grand. I am also in college and have the opportunity to graduate early as I had taken summer quarters and tested out of almost all of my general education classes. It is noteworthy that I paid for my summer quarters in order to get ahead so I could graduate early. Now that graduation is nearing, my Dad has decided that the money that I am saving by not needing to take classes in my senior year could be reinvested into my two younger half-siblings' education instead of helping with my current education costs which as of now I simply cannot afford. Both Chloe and Mark agree that the money that I am saving should be to help pay off some of my loans and help through my remaining quarters as my college is slightly more expensive than theirs, but every time I bring this topic up to my Dad he gets upset and I called him a prick. While I understand that his parent's money was \u201cto help his kids through college\u201d, it seems unfair to me that the effort and money I am putting into graduating early is resulting in my college fund being given away to my other younger siblings while I could have slacked off and gotten the full amount.\n\nTLDR: My siblings are receiving and are both getting the same amount of funding for college but because I am graduating early my dad is giving the money I saved away despite my school being more expensive. My Dad got upset about the topic and I called him a prick.\n\nEdit: People have been asking, my total education costs 100k, I was expected to take loans to cover the rest that the fund did not.\n\nEdit2: INFO: I paid for my summer quarters out of pocket by getting a job, and the college fund is in my name, I just do not have access to the details of the account.\n\nEdit3: People seem confused so I will add more details. In total after graduation, I will be receiving $45,000,  while my siblings will be receiving $60,000. I also will have paid for two of my own quarters that were used to get ahead.\n\nEdit4: My final costs when I graduate will be 75k for 3 years of college, and would have been 100k for all four years.", "created_utc": 1673238988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1074rcy/aita_for_calling_my_dad_a_prick_for_giving_my/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They got $5000 each quarter adding up to $60k each total. You took classes in Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer quarters to graduate in 3 years instead of 4 and your dad isn\u2019t paying for all four quarters, only Fall, Winter, and Spring?

And would you need more than the 60k your siblings got for it to be paid?\n\nBecause if your college ends up costing less than 60k, that's fair because all of you got your schooling paid, which is the point of a college fund.\n\nIf you get 60k and that's not enough, then it's still fair because you all got the same amount of money.\n\nBut if your college costs under 60k and your dad can afford it but doesn't wanna pay it, then you were right to call him a prick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: OP has explained they're getting LESS money than their siblings and it's not enough to finish paying for school, so NTA.", "Well - if that money was technically for ***your*** college education, he should be reimbursing you up to the amount saved $a total of $60K if I understand correctly). If your college costs more than $60K then that\u2019s for you to pay\n\nI don\u2019t understand how you have a surplus in your college fund that your dad wants to shift to your step-siblings but also owe money to your college. If you have a balance left from the $60K that is rightfully your college fund (I\u2019m assuming he doesn\u2019t disagree there), but you paid for the summer sessions, etc., then he needs to reimburse you, even if it\u2019s after the fact (i.e., he only wants to give you $5K every quarter, no more).\n\nSo yeah - not okay. But while he\u2019s the bigger A H, I don\u2019t think calling him names is going to help you get the resolution you want. You can either be blunt or you can be reimbursed, it doesn\u2019t seem like both are going to happen.

You were told you would have that money, and now he's taking it back? Absolutely not cool in the slightest. Go ahead and go another semester or so of college.

So wouldn't he have agreed to pay for the summer quarters as well? Sounds like he broke the deal. Break a deal, face the wheel.", "Is your argument that your dad should have helped pay for the summer quarters / terms? If so, why did he not?", "NTA\n\nIf the idea was 5k a semester the summer classes should be covered, if you are spending more than 5k that isn't part of the deal. Do you know there is still enough in the bank to cover you, after all you only have his word that he is putting it in the younger siblings account. I would suggest cooling down and getting as much as you can from him and then going no contact,", "NTA - Your dad is being a prick and practicing favoritism.

Despite how you proceed continue to focus on your success which will outpace his negligence. Best to you!", "NTA But If your mother is still in the picture you should talk to her. This isn't \"his\" fund, this is both your parents fund and if the deal they made was for it to be used as a collage fund for their biological kids then he can't use it for whatever he wants. If he is pretending to use that money for your half siblings that do not relate to your mother, you or she should be able to sue him", "NTA. He paid $60k for the two other sibling and $45k for you.

These 529 funds are owned and controlled by the people who create them and the use of the money is entirely at their discretion.  If Bob has 4 kids, Nan and Bert,he might very well start a 509 fund when Nan is born with her name and social on it.  When Bert is born, he doesn\u2019t need to start a new account unless he wants to.  He can just keep stashing money in the account already set up.  That money can be withdrawn at any time at Bob\u2019s discretion and for any purpose. It is his money and his account.  If it\u2019s withdrawn and spent on anything other than educational expenses, Bob has to pay extra taxes and a penalty, but if he wants to take that money and buy a Volvo, he can.

The \"extra\" money is not extra. it is the money that was allocated for my fourth year that I will not need as I am graduating early.

OP will be fine, maybe 2 years to pay that off", "I mean it is. It\u2019s just a weird way to say it rather than saying my total education was 75k.

You word everything in a way that is either convoluted or just not straight to the point and that comes across as strange to me", "OP has also been consistent that school was more expensive the other full siblings AND that the amount of financial support agreed to by the father was $60k per child for the 3 children in question. Now father has decided that he's only going to pay for $45k worth of OPs education even though the summer classes are technically a \"quarter\" for which OP should have received funding.

This is despite the fact that the money was paid into by both of HIS parents and not his stepmother. OP's dad is using his ex-wife's money to contribute to his new wife's children's education, in violation of the divorce decree! You can't tell me that's not messed up!
