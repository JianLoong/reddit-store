My niece and nephew are the only family in the wedding, they are the ring bearer and flower girl. Recently my fianc\u00e9(25m) has been trying to add his sister (20f) into the wedding, he asked if I would switch and have her be my MOH instead of my best friend of 8 years, or up the wedding party size to two on each side. When I said no to both he suggested we make her the officiant, she will be 21 by the time we get married and I said no due to the fact that she\u2019s so young, and I don\u2019t think she could take it seriously enough. She\u2019s never been a huge supporter of our relationship and definitely not the wedding. To add a little background when I first started dating my fianc\u00e9 I was actually really close with his sister until she started to spread rumors about me to their family and our mutual friends, she went from being a close friend to someone I could hardly stand to be around. Part of the reason I don\u2019t want her in the wedding is because she hurt me in the past and I can\u2019t trust her to not ruin the wedding in some way if she\u2019s in it. While it\u2019s a small wedding we\u2019re still spending a lot of money.

And still wants her to be a part of the wedding? She's lucky she's getting an invite", "NTA. Your husband is trying to change something you both mutually agreed on. You don't have to include her.", "NTA \nDon\u2019t include people in your wedding party that aren\u2019t in full support of your relationship. And especially don\u2019t have his sister as your MOH or bridesmaid because you don\u2019t have a good relationship.\n\nYou need people by your side who are going to work their butts off to make sure your day is perfect for you!\n\nAlso, a big HECK NO to the officiant idea. I think his sister just needs to stay out of the wedding. If she really really wants to help in some way, MAYBE give her some things to do that wouldn\u2019t be the biggest deal if they were messed up - or don\u2019t. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t give her anything. I didn\u2019t include my husbands sisters in my wedding, only my sister and sister in law (on my side), but we also had a small wedding!", "NTA. Only people who are in support of the couple getting married should be in the wedding party or officiate.\n\nI'd say he can kick out his own best man and have her as best woman, but after all she's done, she obviously doesn't support your union and should not stand up for you in your party", "Your fiance can always ask his sister to stand up for him if he thinks it's so important that she participate in the wedding. And, you're NTA here.", "NTA your negative feelings towards her are justified and she totally doesn't fit in such a small wedding.", "NTA.  In fact I'd ask him why he's so set on having her in the party.  It's your wedding too and him wanting to replace your choices with his is uncool.", "NTA If you were on good terms with his sister it would still be unreasonable for him to ask you to let *his sister* be *your* maid of honor, but the fact that she deeply hurt you in the past and almost destroyed your relationship makes his request truly ludicrous. It's not even a large wedding where all extended family will be invited and her (deserved) absence would be really noticeable. I agree that she'll find a way to ruin your wedding and that's probably why she's pressuring him to invite her. Why is your fianc\u00e9 prioritizing the wishes of his sister instead of the wishes of his fianc\u00e9 on your wedding day?", "NTA, this is your attendant, you did not mandate the Bestman.  But take this as a red flag.  He is trying to bring his sister in in any way shape or form. Start taking notes on how he and his family act or try to get their way in what is going on.", "NTA.  Pump the breaks on the wedding planning until he absolutely understands you personally will not put his sister in a position where she can ruin your wedding.  It is concerning that he's demanding she either be your bridesmaid or officiate the wedding, both positions where she could seriously ruin things if she wanted to.  You and he need premarital counseling", "NTA but like have you said to him that you actively dont want her in the wedding? It sounds a bit like you are making this/letting it be about technicalities when its really about her which tbh does not bode well for a marriage.", "NTA. At first I was going to recommend perhaps she could read a poem or something during the ceremony if she really wanted to be involved (my sisters were very hurt when my brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t include them in their wedding). But after I read about the rumors then I\u2019m going to say no, because I don\u2019t think you should trust her unless she\u2019s matured a lot and apologized since. I don\u2019t really trust him either now. Why would he expect you to replace her as your MOH? Very odd.", "NTA.\n\nIt is completely understandable why you don't want her involved. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9's request is unacceptable and inconsiderate of you as well as the plan you had both previously agreed to.\n\nIf he wants her involved so badly, let him replace his best man with her. Rather than expecting you to replace your best friend with someone who actively tried to destroy both your relationship and reputation.", "She can pass out the rice or bubbles or something", "Your fianc\u00e9 can add his sister as his attendant. The numbers don't have to be even. And he would not be the a-hole for wanting to include his sister. I think making her his groomswoman is a reasonable compromise, frankly.\n\nNAH", "YTA the only people allowed to the wedding are your family and your friend???? He has nobody allowed to go?

Why does your fiance not care about what she did?", "I don't know why this got downvoted.  This is actually a reasonable solution.  She can stand on his side of the stage.  That way she's included, it unruffles feathers for his family, etc.\n\nFolks, the people in your wedding party are not people who have pledged fealty to you.  They are just people who were a particular outfit and stand nearish you while you're exchanging your vows.  Sometimes they are besties, sometimes they are siblings -- sometimes they are your cousin you haven't seen in 12 years because her mom was your mom's MOH 40 years ago and for the love of god please just put her in the lineup so Thanksgiving every year for the next 30 years isn't a nightmare for your mom.   My point is, it's really just not that big of a deal.      \n\n\nYou're marrying this guy.  His sister is very likely going to be part of your life in some way, shape, or form for a long time.   It obviously matters to your future husband because he's asking you for this.   She exhibited poor behavior when she was a teenager; I encourage you to let it go.  Letting her stand up front in a frothy gown is a good way to buy some goodwill from your new family.   It doesn't require you to like her, involve her in a bunch of parties or wedding decisions, etc."]}
