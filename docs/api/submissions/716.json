You don't trust your mom, she doesn't trust you. **I don't think there are any assholes in this scenario.** \n\nTrust is something that's built and both sides have to work on it. \n\nIt's also important that there be room for trust - taking away your privacy doesn't give you space to make your own choices and earn trust. \n\nSoon enough (if not already) you'll be faced with choices that your mom can't supervise. I hope she can extend you some trust now so that you can learn to make small choices (like finishing homework before gaming) before you have to make those big choices.", "ESH-she probably should\u2019ve just told you the truth. However, you were also demonstrating a reason for her to have that software.\n\nIt isn\u2019t a violation of your privacy because (I\u2019m assuming so correct me if I\u2019m wrong) it\u2019s her computer, not yours.

Your mom has the ability to see you're not doing your work. She tells you to do your work. You do it and then you realize how serious... what is? The fact she's able to tell when you're lying? \n\nAnd let's be real this is not the first time you've lied about doing you're homework. It is well within a parents right to if their child is doing their homework. \n\nThe only thing your mom did wrong was yell at you. It's unclear what she \"lied\" about based on your post.

Understandable, though, because you\u2019re 13. Unless this is your personal computer that you bought you shouldn\u2019t have expectations of privacy on it.

And it is your mothers job to make sure you are not exposed to harmful things and to make sure you keep your priorities straight.
