Are people boycotting Harry Potter?\n\nThanks for the game tips. My knowledge of games is pretty limited, so these tips help.", "I've told her I'll play with her but not against her, but she's still kinda bummed", "The compromise is to play on the same team or cooperative games, as OP said.", "But even if you do lose all 100 just get over it lol you\u2019re a full grown man!", "Or maybe... and hear me out cuz I know this sounds crazy, they are just smarter than you?", "I\u2019m a woman and I can\u2019t seem to win against my husband, except on rare occasions. I tend to win when we just learned a game for the first time, because he seems to struggle more than me with remembering every new rule. He\u2019s just too naturally good at strategy/economic games though, nothing weird going on. Videogames as well, but I\u2019m not really good at videogames even though I like to play. He usually wipes the floor with me on smash bros.\n\nBut I always win logic/puzzle (cryptid, planet x) games and chess. He\u2019s kind of a sore loser, so he gets too frustrated when he plays chess against me because he\u2019s a beginner and I\u2019m more advanced (not too much, just enough to beat him). So he just refuses to play. If he managed to put some effort, though, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d beat me at chess too.\n\nEdit: actually, OP, maybe you should try to play chess against your wife? There\u2019s 0 luck involved, if you study it some you\u2019ll have objectively too much advantage against her and there\u2019s no way you won\u2019t win most games (supposing you two don\u2019t already play it).", "My wife and I play sequence. I'd say it's a pretty even split. A lot of chance with some minor strategy. Good shit.", "I\u2019ve only been married a few years, but I know my husband really, really well - especially when we play games together. So if she\u2019s especially observant and her edge is knowing her opponent, that could be working in her favor, too. I know that doesn\u2019t answer for the chance examples you gave, but it really is possible she\u2019s subconsciously aware of likely outcomes.", "I play mortal combat with my son occasionally (he was born female), and he 90% of the time wins. It's that way in board games and card games! It's frustrating losing so much, and it takes the fun out of playing. I always ask him if he let me win when I do win. He always says no, but I think he's lying and lets me win.", "Whenever my husband and I play classic board games, trivia stuff on paper, whatever, I always win. When we go electronic, he wins just as often, if not more than me. Get the classics on some gaming device, play 'em that way. \n\nI wouldn't say you're TA. Even if you aren't a sore loser, it sucks to lose all the time to someone, even if it is fair and square.", "My wife hardly ever enters anything, and when she does, it's mostly by default/accident, like all visitors at a museum automatically get their names put into a hat for a prize draw, and guess who comes away with a 20 dollar gift card to the museum gift shop...", "Castle Panic is a blast.", "Zombicide is very fun! Got my partner and I through living in a city where we didn't know anyone but each other. Parks is fun too, although you do play against each other, but Parks has a single player mode, so your wife does have something to play by herself if she wants.", "Hahaha smarter and smarter! Playing the idiot tax is just a bad idea. Raffles are smart. Very limited pools of winners. I guess you got....Lucky!", "Older than you buddy, and def old enough to not act prepubescent", "Well, boycotting JK Rowling would be more accurate. I don't wanna start a political conversation so Google it if you're curious :)\n\nAnd no problem! Vs games make me anxious but my husband loves board games so we're always watching for good two player coop. You can also check out boardgamegeek.com or your local board game shop if you have one! There's so much out there these days!", "Are you crazy !!?? That could never be what it is... this is clearly voodoo, it's the only liable explanation /s", "Intelligence rarely has anything to do with winning board games. Quit trying to make this something sexist dude.", "You're kinda acting prepubescent right now", "Lol our local board game shop is the supermarket because we live in a tiny town in the Arctic Circle. Thank God for Amazon.", "I\u2019m not the one bitching about my wife on a public forum.\n\nDownvote me.\n\nGrow up.\n\nCherish your spouse"]}
