I am fine with this arrangement and roommates have been fine with it for the last 3 years. There is three of us living in the house. The Internet bill is in my name and I am sure to pay it each month and my roommates pay their third if the bill. I let them pay when they around to it each month. I've never had a problem with it as long as they pay me. This month they still haven't paid me, so I asked them about it. They said that they aren't going to pay since the bill is not in their name. I told them that if they don't pay me by the end of the week I will cut off their internet access. I gave them the weekend to pay me and nothing. I texted both of them on Monday morning asking them to pay me or I will be cutting off their access and changing the password. They haven't responded. So I changed the password. Now I am getting texts from both of them saying that I am such an a-hole. I am not going to give them the new password until they pay me.\n\n*UPDATE*\nWhen I got home from work one of my roommates suddenly had the money that they owed me. The other had some story about how they will pay me at some point but not right now. They asked that since they intended to pay now they should have access to the internet. I took some advice from a commenter and said that I won't give either of them access until both pay.

I once had a house where we didn\u2019t get internet at all because one of the roommates (I lived with a couple) was a deadbeat.

Also as the account owner you should have admin access to the router, so you should have the ability to only permit connections from approved devices and block connections from all others.
