My family history is insane and long but short version my grandparents died when my mom and her siblings were very young. There are 14 of them amd my oldest uncle at 18 took them all in. We grew up as an EXTREMELY close family and \"family is everything\" was instilled in our brains at a young age. My grandpa was also left on the door of the orphanage in Spain as a baby with no true identity known and then the orphanage was bombed so he was sent to Mexico where his identity changed again. He was then adopted so it changed again lol. We don't know his birth name or actual birthday/age. It was guestimated by looking at him. So anything from him was \"sacred\".

The value is sentimental. You still know that piece was your mother's. You remember where it has been. That you made it a part of your home is enough. Your friend getting upset about this is weird.

The looking down on it is because, unfortunately, some people have ruined an expensive antique by restoring it when it would have more value in its unrestored state. If your grandfather was an important, well known furniture craftsman whose pieces are sought out by collectors that's one thing, but you didn't say that. It's obvious he was a skilled craftsman (as you still have the piece, enjoy it, and restored it) and anyone would be pleased to own his work, but it wasn't a sin to repsint it.\n\nThe gf can be unhappy about it if she wants to be, but she's wrong in her opinion and definitely wrong to spoil the evening over it.", "NTA.

I agree with you, not my thing... except for a few examples I saw where there's a clear \"center\" of the rings that gives a water drop ripple effect. THAT could be really pretty...I'm imagining a table could give off the effect of raindrops in a puddle with several of those boards. Especially in a dark contrast stain!\n\nIt would likely be a pain in the ass to find the perfect boards for that though. Most of the grain patterns look like a lot of noise with weird gaps.", "I think it very much depends on the piece of furniture in question. Something that you know has a history of being painted\u2026 paint on. Something that has never been painted in it\u2018s 150 yrs of existence\u2026. Yeah probably don\u2019t slap a coat of paint on that.  I swing between the two depending on the history of the pieces but I also love refinishing old pieces\u2026. For myself, it\u2019s way to much work to do for other people, and I\u2019ve also taken things to be restored.
