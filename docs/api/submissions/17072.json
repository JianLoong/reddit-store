It isn't some rare old antique built by Paul Revere, the value of which would be lessened by any type of restoration.  NTA", "NTA. Your friend is weird for being offended with how you decided to treat *your own* family heirloom. and she's clearly never heard of restoring antique furniture", "NTA. Imo the point of the heirloom is to keep it in the family, which you did. What you do with it from there on is no one's business but your own. Tell the gf it's none of her business what you do with it", "NTA, this friend's girlfriend doesn't deserve another invitation to your home.", "NTA:  \nIt is your heirloom now. And therefore yours to do with as you please.", "NTA at all, but your \"friend\" sure is. They have no right to even comment on what you do with your furniture, heirloom or not. Also, you can do whatever the f you want with your belongings.\n\nFinally, painting the dresser does not ruin it or diminish the memory of your mother that is tied to it. As you know, it could always be stripped again and re-done in the original style if you wanted. If anything, the fresh paint and fixes you did will prolong its life and provide enjoyment for years to come. That's the best part about quality wood furniture, it doesn't need replacement, it can be restored.", "NTA. Your friend needs a kick it\u2019s not her dresser. The only real value something like that would hold is sentimental so however you like it is the best way. There is furniture that this would be a shame to do to but a generic wood dresser built by your grandfather is not such a piece. And besides that again\u2026 it\u2019s yours. My guess is your friend has watched too much antiques roadshow.", "NTA  I build things for people and depending on how they want to finish it will decide what quality of wood I will use. It sounds like your grandfather knew it was going to be painted and didn\u2019t use more expensive stainable wood. Don\u2019t let someone, who doesn\u2019t really know the history of the piece, make you feel bad about your choice of what you did to the piece. Even if was better wood, ultimately it is your piece of furniture and you can do whatever you works best for you.", "Who cares what some dork says? She\u2019s doesn\u2019t know your mom. You do. And if you think she\u2019d love the dresser to be painted, paint that dresser as much as you want. It\u2019s NOT this girl\u2019s business lol.", "NTA and none of the girlfriend's business, either. The dresser is now yours. You didn't send it to the landfill - you stripped it, repaired it, and painted it so you can enjoy it for years to come. If you get sick of the paint, you can strip it again. NBD.", "NTA and she was way out of line. The fact that she was angry over something that doesn't involve her makes her sound unreasonable and unstable.", "NTA - who cares what the gf thinks?", "Nta. It sounds like you saved and gave the dresser a face-lift. It's now your dresser. Your grandfather was an amazing woodworker, and it's great that it is still in good condition to be handed down. Don't feel guilty about a jealous persons words about changing a heirloom. I'm sure your family would be proud of keeping good care of it.", "NTA  \nWhy do you even care what your friend's girlfriend thinks? Really, it is your heirloom, not hers, and you can do whatever you like with it. Chances are the whole thing triggered some trauma in the girlfriend's past and she over-reacted by chastising you. It was none of her business and should be none of your concern. \n\nI think it's nice that you are continuing to use the dresser. The memories it holds are deeper than any coat of paint.", "NTA. This type of heirloom is supposed to evolve and become a part of the new family. They can go down generations this way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Would never want to paint that.\n\nThough, I don't really seem to care for the look of quarter-sawn grain for some reason.

I do understand the stability thing with quarter-sawn - just not the look", "Thing is that I really don't care - if I was considered an AH for doing this, it would not change anything in my mind. But, I do find it interesting to see how other people think and feel about things. I think it is good to see how other people deal with the world.\n\nI am not sentimental - keeping \"keepsakes\" just isn't my thing. But, it is a thing and many people do it, so I was interested in seeing if this girl was correct that my painting of the dresser somehow changed its emotional/sentimental value and if other people who are sentimental would have not painted it.\n\nDresser is staying as-is until I decide to go with another look - in which case I will paint it again (even if that would make me an AH). But I feel that I have grown as a person by getting other's input in how this is considered by those other people."]}
