Sensory issues is a no joke, and people without them do not understand how uncomfortable or painful it can be. \n\nBut if your psychiatrist is concerned about your attachment to your service dog, you might need really look at that. Unfortunately, our four legged friends have a short life span and cannot be all you relay on. Your mother may be trying to help you in a desperate attempt to \u201cjust cope with it\u201d but you may have to educate her more on why crowds or loud noises may be too much for you. (Btw pleas talk more to your psychiatrist about why he is so concerned about this issue). \n\nIf the hotel allows service dogs it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. And mother shouldn\u2019t be concerned about it. \n\nHowever, I think your mother is trying to help you (in a desperate attempt like a parent throwing a child into a lake to learn to swim). It\u2019s not the way to go. Talk with her more. And I hope for the best for you.", "Don't text your brother. Call him. This may well be your mother and not a restriction your brother is trying to impose.

You completely ignored the advice.\n\n>I was doing fine at that point until he intervened. \n\nYou can't assess that.   And there's a difference between doing fine and extending your living strategies and coping abilities. \n\n>My mom is frequently making comments about hoping I don\u2019t need my service animal anymore since I started O.T. and has been restricting the time he can go out places with me a lot. \n\nAnd there's your mom being a mom.  Trying to do what's right for you even if you won't see it. \n\n>mom(who I live with since my living skills are not that great)\n\nSo your living skills aren't great and your comfortable to miss your brothers wedding.   And you expect a text will make that OK?!  I'm circling around to the point the psych made... you could've been working on other living skills.   You could've become more independent even if needing your mom as backup.  You could've been attending your brother's wedding.   And still kept the dog.  But you just go with saying you're doing fine.  YTA", "NTA and you should definitely give your brother a heads up about why you\u2019re not going and specify that your mother set this restriction on you. If your brother agrees with your mother, then stay home\u2026 but I\u2019d honestly like to know his opinion about the situation.", "NTA.\n\nOne, it's dubious if  your family can legally ban your service animal, if it is being hosted in a place of public accommodation (a hotel) where the ADA would be in effect.\n\nBut honestly your mom and your psych are AH. Why is your mom restricting your use of a LEGAL SERVICE ANIMAL? Why would your psych try to push you away from your service animal if it helps you function!?\n\nI know it sounds like you struggle with living skills, but I hope you are able to find a new accommodation eventually because it's horrible your family can't understand + help support you. Tell you brother your support animal will be there and make sure he's on board.", "INFO - Are you dependent on your mom?", "Contact your brother FIRST before anything else. Ask if you can bring your service dog. Then go from there. \n\n(And so what if the hotel is on a busy street? You walk the dog on leash, of course. You'll find an appropriate place to potty - and bag it.)", "I am curious as to whether you were present when your therapist said restrict the dig or whether your mother just said that he said that ?", "Please talk to your brother (or at least text if you are more comfortable communicating that way) before you make any decisions about attending.", "I'd say skip the wedding because the issue of you using the dog as an unnecessary crutch is not going to be solved before this wedding.\n\nBTW, why does your psychiatrist not love the dog idea?", "NTA. \n\nHonestly, I would probably recommend having a conversation with your brother about this just to make sure that the information you\u2019ve received from your mum is accurate. \n\nYou mention that it\u2019s *her reasoning*, is any of this coming from your brother? I would ignore her. It\u2019s not her call, it\u2019s his. I would ask him how he feels about it, and if he gives you the all clear, I would draw boundaries with your mum and tell her you can make your own decisions regarding accessibility. \n\nThen I would go to the wedding with your Service Dog. If she has an issue with it, she\u2019s the problem, not you. \n\n\u2026Your psychiatrist told your mother to restrict the time you had with your Service Dog? That\u2019s a good sign to get a new psychiatrist, I think. Restricting someone\u2019s access to a Service Dog could be detrimental to both them and their Service Dog\u2019s training. I would draw a firm boundary and take away her control in this situation, tell her that you\u2019re making the choice to use your Service Dog to perform the tasks they\u2019re trained to do, that you\u2019re not letting someone else choose to restrict that.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like a dreadful parent. Definitely tell your brother what the deal is.", "NTA. \n\nTechnically, your brother\u2019s fiance is violating ADA rules - a venue cannot refuse to accommodate your service animal. I doubt you could really do anything about it, but if you showed up with the dog, they couldn\u2019t kick you out either.", "Does your psychiatrist not understand how service dogs work? You\u2019re together 24/7. That\u2019s a fundamental tenet of being a service dog team. I can\u2019t believe a medical professional would suggest spending less time with your SERVICE DOG. Every reputable service dog organization in the world would absolutely blast this premise.", "After talking to your brother, also verify with the hotel that the animal is allowed. Is it a legally recognized service animal, therapy animal or an emotional support animal. I am assuming there is catering and food service to the banquet room. The legal status of the animal might be regulated under the board of health. They cannot restrict service  animals but others may be disallowed because of food prep/service depending on your juristiction.", "YTA.\nYou need to find more than one way to cope. \nYour dog is one. \nBut missing out on life without your dog isn\u2019t ok. \nWhat happens when your dog dies?\nI\u2019m not being an Ah. I have adhd. \nThinking a text telling your brother you won\u2019t at his wedding also makes YTA. \n\n\nI have different strategies for different situations.\nJust because you have one being your dog doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have more. \n\n\nPeople saying you should ignore your therapist who has a lot more training than anyone in the comments have listed are dreaming.", "NTA \nAnyone going to any wedding is doing the bride and groom a favor and they would do well to remember that. \n\nThat\u2019s a full enough answer to your question, but I would be interested to learn what task the dog has been trained to perform that helps you overcome your disability. I say this because being able to articulate this will go a long way towards convincing those around you that this is, in fact, a service animal and not simply a pet who\u2019s presence is calming to you.", "NAH except your mother who seems to only complicate things ti get what she wants - i.e. \"prove\" that you really dont need that dog. The bride and groom are in their rights to refuse animals, even service dogs, in their wedding. You are as much in the rights to not come to a wedding. It's an invitation, not a prompt, and you seem to do it in a polite way.", "Yes, YTA. Your own psychiatrist told you that you the way you rely on your service animal is a detriment to yourself and gave you professional medical advice to lower your reliance on the animal. \n\nYou can't attend once in a lifetime event that is this extremely important to someone you care about because you can't be separated from the dog *you've been medically ordered to wean yourself off relying on*. It's more important to you to feel comfortable with the dog, than it is to be able to attend this event. You don't seem distressed at all about now being able to make it, in fact you seem relieved you don't have to go. \n\n\nI looked through your post history and I see you teach kids in an afterschool program, and you used to be able to go out and cope and have a life before you had this dog. Now that you have the dog, you restrict yourself to places the dog can come with you. You rely on the dog to cope and have lost your ability to do it on your own. \n\nThe dog is a crutch, and that can be good or bad. A crutch is good when you can't walk on your own and you need help. A crutch is bad if you can already walk on your own and you start relying on the crutches to move you.", "You should ask your brother directly since your mom could be wrong. NTA if it is true. But I suspect you could bring the dog if you take care of everything.", "NTA\n\nSensory issues are crippling, your mother sounds very much like she is the one pushing the issue as though she feels you are dependent on your dog.\n\nHas your mother ever educated herself on sensory issues at all or autism? I feel like there is a complete lack of empathy and understanding here, have you spoken to your brother or a close family about the situation? Someone who can support you emotionally and mentally while you try to navigate this?", "You need a new therapist. How soon can you get away from your Mom? It does not sound like she is very kind to you.  NTA", "YTA if you did without actually talking to your brother. Your mother seems to be the one with the issue not your brother. She is the one saying the dog is not allowed, not him. And she is using the event to drive in a deeper issue - in her opinion, you do not need the dog.

You can choose not to go for any reason, but that doesn't mean that the hurt YOU cause by not going is any less. You showed your entire family that their big life event don't matter to you if your emotional support animal can't be there. Essentially, you made it clear your dog means more to you than them. They have every right to be hurt and not want someone in their life who doesn't make an effort to be part of their it. \n\nGoing to the wedding was supposed to be sharing in your brother's happiness and supporting him, but you only thought about yourself and your dog.

Denying OP her service dog and restricting her independence is awful- helping her learn to emotionally regulate independently is presumably a process that needs to be handled with medical advice and much more delicately. And expecting OP to go without her dog at a wedding, aka one of the most challenging sensory events- shitty. It kind of sounds like OPs mum doesn't want her to go- if she truly had her best interests at heart she might suggest leaving the service dog behind but prioritise her daughter's attendance.", "With the psychiatrist it's complicated. It could be that he is just crap, but I can see an argument for working on OP being able to cope without the dog in certain situations- service dogs aren't machines and it would be problematic for OP to be entirely screwed if something suddenly happens to the dog. In the UK at least it can be really hard to be matched to a service dog, so if anything did happen OP needs to be able to manage somewhat in the interim .\n\nBefore people come at me about service dogs being 'medical equipment' this logic extends to dogs for the blind and diabetics etc. It's important for blind people and diabetics to be able to manage their own conditions too to a certain extent (I know that most blind people are entirely independent without service dogs so not an ideal comparison).\n\nMum is totally an AH though- I don't know why she thinks a wedding is a good venue for OP to learn to go without her dog.", "There could be family members with a severe allergy or phobia to dogs. Weddings are private, they can discriminate against whoever they want for any reason.", "It's the mom, not the fiance, and i dont think this would violate ADA. If it was the venue itself saying the dog couldnt come, that would be a violation. But a private party can disallow anyone they want from coming to their private event.", "I don't agree with you here. It's not the venue, it's the couple. It is lame of them but I guess that is their decision. Besides, I got into it with people the other day about kids crying (doesn't matter) and they said being a child is a protected class. If that is true, and kids can be excluded from weddings, I would imagine the same goes for service animals.", "Yeah and the psychiatrist shouldn't be divulging his concerns to her mother. Even if she has custody of her adult daughter. If they can't do it for children, they can't do it for this. So I wonder if the mom made that up to further harm her daughter.", "I cannot fathom under what circumstances OP would be the arsehole. Sorry, but is their brother not aware that they have a service dog? If so, they don\u2019t sound close. Clearly their mother doesn\u2019t understand the idea of service dogs and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it ran in the family. Not a wedding I\u2019d be sad to miss, what with one thing and another.", "People with disabilities are among the most likely to be abused by family members, medical staff, and caretakers.

It's easy to agree, though, that denying the dog and applying restrictions could not possibly be helpful. \n\n>helping her learn to emotionally regulate independently is presumably a process that needs to be handled with medical advice and much more delicate\n\nAnd there's the problem tho.  OP has rejected medical advice,  thus also denying mom the benefit of their advice and follow-up.  Mom has probably not dealt with this before in her life.... she needs support", "Having children is a protected familial status for purposes of housing (with senior living places being the only exception), but not in general. Most bars are 21+, R movies don't allow children under 18, etc and so forth.\nBut still definitely agree with you overall, it's their wedding. They can exclude dogs, children, people over 50, whoever they want. You can't be forced to invite someone to your own wedding", "She'd only be the AH if she let her mother's stupidity wreck a relationship with her brother without checking in with him first. It may run in family, it may not. Damaged a relationship with a cousin due to similar issues with my mother. Pets welcome at an event but not my pets as not traditional. Day would have been so much drama with my mother constantly making them an issue and couldn't get a sitter. But that was a much more distant relationship than with a brother.", "Yeah but this reeeeaally doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. Another commenter pointed out that based on OPs post history they actually seem to have restricted/ closed off their life since getting their service dog. It\u2019s appalling how many commenters are basically telling OP that they should disregard the advice of their psychiatrist.", "Damn, where were you 4 days ago? You totally laid out info that would have helped me.", "I\u2019m not appalled, doctors are human like everyone else but far less likely to admit it. I had a psychiatrist put me on a med that lowered my bone density so much that I\u2019m now disabled myself. For eighteen months I was ignored, then called \u201ctreatment resistant\u201d when I said my body hurt. And now, because I\u2019m visibly disabled, getting taken seriously by ANY medical professional is impossible. It\u2019s a facet of internalized ableism that we assume doctors know everything."]}
