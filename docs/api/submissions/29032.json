It's an invitation, not a prompt, and you seem to do it in a polite way.", "Yes, YTA. Your own psychiatrist told you that you the way you rely on your service animal is a detriment to yourself and gave you professional medical advice to lower your reliance on the animal. \n\nYou can't attend once in a lifetime event that is this extremely important to someone you care about because you can't be separated from the dog *you've been medically ordered to wean yourself off relying on*. It's more important to you to feel comfortable with the dog, than it is to be able to attend this event. You don't seem distressed at all about now being able to make it, in fact you seem relieved you don't have to go. \n\n\nI looked through your post history and I see you teach kids in an afterschool program, and you used to be able to go out and cope and have a life before you had this dog. Now that you have the dog, you restrict yourself to places the dog can come with you. You rely on the dog to cope and have lost your ability to do it on your own. \n\nThe dog is a crutch, and that can be good or bad. A crutch is good when you can't walk on your own and you need help.

Denying OP her service dog and restricting her independence is awful- helping her learn to emotionally regulate independently is presumably a process that needs to be handled with medical advice and much more delicately. And expecting OP to go without her dog at a wedding, aka one of the most challenging sensory events- shitty. It kind of sounds like OPs mum doesn't want her to go- if she truly had her best interests at heart she might suggest leaving the service dog behind but prioritise her daughter's attendance.", "With the psychiatrist it's complicated. It could be that he is just crap, but I can see an argument for working on OP being able to cope without the dog in certain situations- service dogs aren't machines and it would be problematic for OP to be entirely screwed if something suddenly happens to the dog. In the UK at least it can be really hard to be matched to a service dog, so if anything did happen OP needs to be able to manage somewhat in the interim .\n\nBefore people come at me about service dogs being 'medical equipment' this logic extends to dogs for the blind and diabetics etc. It's important for blind people and diabetics to be able to manage their own conditions too to a certain extent (I know that most blind people are entirely independent without service dogs so not an ideal comparison).\n\nMum is totally an AH though- I don't know why she thinks a wedding is a good venue for OP to learn to go without her dog.", "There could be family members with a severe allergy or phobia to dogs.

It is lame of them but I guess that is their decision. Besides, I got into it with people the other day about kids crying (doesn't matter) and they said being a child is a protected class. If that is true, and kids can be excluded from weddings, I would imagine the same goes for service animals.", "Yeah and the psychiatrist shouldn't be divulging his concerns to her mother.

If you want to go, and your dog is cleared, make your own transport arrangements and go. Whether your mother likes it or not. \n\nSecond, you psychiatrist. They should be speaking to you, not to your mother. Why did they speak to her? What was said? Was this in your presence, or is your mother simply reporting what she wanted to hear? If your psychiatrist talks to her behind your back, I\u2019d look for someone who centres ME and does not share my medical information with others without my consent. \n\nThird, you\u2019d dependence on your dog. That\u2019s something you need to address because dogs can get injured or dies, and your life needs to go on regardless. But your mother is not a trained professional and denying you your coping strategy in a high-stress environment is not how that shit works. You need to work with a counselling professional to ensure you\u2019re not overly reliant on that dog, but this needs to be a deliberate program of small steps. Be proactive in this, expand your comfort zone. This is not your mother\u2019s call. \n\nFourth, your mother. You\u2019re in the unenviable position of living with her and have her treat you as a child. You need to work on your independent living skills and find a solution where you are supported, rather than smothered. That\u2019s gonna be hard, but you need to step into the driving seat.

I'm curious what exactly a service dog is trained to do for sensory disorders? I'm not trying to be a jerk, just better understand this because when I think service animal I picture a dog who's job is to warn of a seizure or something closer to that nature or being the eyes for their blind owner. I have a son with ASD and he has a whole lot of sensory issues.\n\nI have difficulty judging if you are or are not the AH because of missing information. There is a difference between a service animal and an emotional support animal. While I understand service dogs could be there to help for sensory issues, the way your therapist believes you need to stop using your dog as a crutch makes me wonder if he's not actually a trained service animal? Do you still live at home? What is your age?", "The first thing I would ask is this a trained service animal or an emotional support animal? Many claim to have a service animal when it is not. I\u2019m not accusing you of this but it would help to clarify this situation. If it is truly a service animal then call your brother and ask him if he is fine having your dog with you. Don\u2019t trust your mom on this. NTA for asking him or not going if he would prefer your dog not attending. There are laws regarding allowing service animals in hotels, stores, etc, Those do not apply to a person not wanting the animal at their home or attending their wedding ceremony.", "ESH.\n\nYour mom and doctor are trying to do what is best for you. Your dog won't be around for the rest of your life and if you can't cope without then you're going to be in for a real shock when that day comes. This isn't really a 1:1 comparison but it's like taking a medication for depression or anxiety but refusing therapy to develop coping skills because \"I have the pills, I don't need to do anything else.\" Why would you not want to learn how to get better at managing your disability on your own?\n\nOn the other hand, a WEDDING is not the place to throw you in the deep end without a life vest. I'm sure your brother wouldn't appreciate you having a meltdown in the middle of the wedding. It wouldn't be your fault, but it would still be a wedding-ruining occurrence for most people depending on how severe. While your mom is definitely just trying to help, she's setting you up for failure because you're not ready for that yet. Weddings are loud and there will presumably be a lot of people there and if you overload it will cause problems for your brother and his partner and they might (depending on your relationship) resent you for it even if it's really your mom's fault.\n\nI would recommend trying to come to some kind of compromise with your mother before you just back out of the wedding (especially don't do that without talking to your brother first.) \"I understand you are trying to help me not rely fully on my dog, but I'm not confident I'll be able to get through a wedding without causing a scene without them, and I'm sure brother wouldn't appreciate that.

There are SO MANY bad ones out there, who are unhelpful and sometimes damaging.  I encourage you to work with a good therapist to determine if your reliance on your dog is too much.

A giant wedding in an unknown location filled with people you do not know that will be noisy and bright and super triggering is NOT the place. It is unreasonable to expect you to be okay with that.

I\u2019m working with my therapist on overcoming these issues, and we decided on the socks together but she was very adamant that I only tackle ONE at a time. Working on restricting your reliance on your dog should only be tackled ONE place at a time. \n\nYou are already struggling with this change in your OT; you are NTA for refusing to bite off what you KNOW is more than you can chew.
