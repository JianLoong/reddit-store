{"id": 15523, "submission_id": "12wnolb", "title": "AITA for refusing to believe my friend when she accused her boyfriend of abuse?", "selftext": "My (F23) friend (F24) has had multiple (around six) messy breakups over the past five years. All of them have involved her accusing her boyfriend of being extremely emotionally and financially abusive. However, I\u2019ve noticed that the supposedly \u201cabusive\u201d behaviors she\u2019s complained to me and our friends about don\u2019t really sound abusive at all. \n\nFor example, she would call her boyfriend\u2019s refusal to buy her an expensive anniversary gift \u201cfinancial abuse,\u201d or him leaving her on read (in text messages) as \u201cemotional abuse.\u201d I never really called her out before because she was always emotionally distraught when venting to me and I recognized that their might be context that I don\u2019t know about. Also, I just wanted to be a supportive friend.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve noticed that the guys she publicly accuses of being abusing (she\u2019ll post about them on social media with vague accusations of abuse) have no history of being  described that way by other exes. Combined with my friend\u2019s tendency to misconstrue abuse, I\u2019ve been finding it hard to believe all her allegations. I\u2019ve also felt increasingly repulsed by her tendency to throw around accusations because a lot of her exes have been slandered and ostracized after she tries to expose them online.\n\nToday, she was crying and told our friend group about how her current boyfriend is abusing her financially because he refuses to buy her an annual pass to Disney World. I told her that that action alone is in no way financial abuse and that she needs to learn what those terms mean before carelessly throwing around accusations. She and a couple other friends started getting mad at me and told me that I \u201chave no idea what [I\u2019m] talking about\u201d and that I\u2019m a \u201cshitty, unsupportive friend.\u201d\n\nMy friend also ended up crying even more and now I feel guilty about that.

Her and those other friends are absolutely delusional if they think not getting expensive gifts is financial abuse. She's not entitled to a Disney Pass ffs. How do you tolerate these ppl?", "You are not \"refusing to believe accusations.\" You are merely determining that the lack of luxury purchases is abusive.\n\nNTA.\n\n# Why are you friends with this person?", "NTA at all.  The weird thing is, though, that it sounds like she genuinely believes she\u2019s being abused. But, as long as she has people around her enabling this mindset, she\u2019s never going to really understand what she\u2019s doing. \n\nDrop her as a friend.", "NTA. \n\nShe sounds like a real treat. I would slowly stop being friends with her so she doesn\u2019t start publicly accusing you of abuse. Those accusations can be very damaging, and it\u2019s unfortunate that abusive people take advantage of that.\n\nShe is ABUSIVE, and you should genuinely distance yourself.", "NTA\n\nNow you've called her out, be prepared to be called abusive and have other accusations thrown your way.\n\nFind less toxic people to spend your time around.", "NTA but you need new friends.", "NTA\n\nIf she was taking her boyfriend's credit card and buying herself a pass to Disney World *that* would be financial abuse but you're quite right that from what you know she's not being abused at all.\n\nHer exes should get together and file a class action against her for slander.", "NTA. Your friend and her supporters have no idea what financial abuse is. Not only that they decided that instead of looking into what it means they'll just pile on you as being a crappy friend. Your friend sounds EXHAUSTING and DRAMATIC. Why are you friends with this person?", "I never want to dismiss a cry for help from a potential victim of abuse, but come on fancy presents, fancy trips, not being on beck and call 24/7. She seems more interested in a personal assistant, not a partner. NTA.", "NTA & WTF is wrong with her. She is actively hurting real victims of abuse. This is like the Me Too drama all over again where Drama Llamas were desperate for attention so cried about men looking at them on a bus.\n\nThese people shout louder than real victims & just cause people to eyeroll at best. She's not friend material.", "NTA - That\u2019s not abuse.  It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t believe her story, but that her story clearly describes something that is not abuse.  This kind of melodrama only makes it harder for real victims of abuse.", "NTA, she sounds like an attention seeker. I think she\u2019s toxic not the boyfriends", "NTA and for someone like myself who has been in a real abusive relationship this is infuriating to hear. This is one of the reasons why it's hard for society to believe us. BUT I do want to point out just because one person is abusive in one relationship doesn't mean they're not in their former relationships. People change. So please don't use the other exes as a reason not to believe someone.\n\nDepending on the friendship, you can point out ,and with the other friends, pages like BTSADV on FB to educate them on what real abuse looks like. We're surrounded by so many misinformation nowadays and it doesn't hurt to educate others. However, if that friendship isn't that deep and she's just using the abuse card to get sympathy then by all means cut the cord.", "NTA, your friend sounds entitled.", "NTA, not only is she entitled and dramatic, she has no respect for actual victims of abuse by throwing around those terms around for absurd reasons", "NTA\n\nShe sounds entitled and a bit of an attention seeker. I can't fathom why your supposed friends would be angry at you for saying what is essentially the truth. I would reconsider those friends.", "Nta. Big cry wolf thing. When it really happens no one is going to believe her.", ">she would call her boyfriend\u2019s refusal to buy her an expensive anniversary gift \u201cfinancial abuse,\u201d or him leaving her on read (in text messages) as \u201cemotional abuse.\u201d\n\nNTA - I can't even begin to tell you how much this upsets me. Entitled people who cry abuse at everyone because they don't get what they want, make me sick. I am a survivor of real dv and abuse and am outraged when people make light of the suffering that actual abuse victims go through with their petty bs.\n\nI can't even begin to tell you how triggering this is for me. I need to log off and calm down.", "NTA. I feel bad for all of her exes because she takes this crap online.", "NTA\n\nyour friend is extremely manipulative and is causing SERIOUS damage to those people's lives. and in a lot of those cases (if not all) she can be held accountable. sued or even criminally charged. because, her false accusations can result in loss of employment/income, potential repercussions from people who believe her lies (as in guys physically assaulting this man), could result in a police investigation or worse. \n\nshe needs to grow up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
