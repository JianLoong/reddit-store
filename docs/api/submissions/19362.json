If you get too them when you get home it takes usually 20 minutes in all. Every kid has different chores depending on age, can\u2019t have the 7 year old take the kitchen trash out. It works really well overall and they can see there four chores each day for the month.\n\nMy son has been pawing of his chores to his youngest sister 12. So she basically has been doing 8 chores a day. My daughter came to me upset not understanding why I was giving his chores to her. I wasn\u2019t she was lied to by him and since they usually do them when I am at work I didn\u2019t notice.\n\nSo as a punishment since he had her due his chores for about a little over a month (36 days) He has to do 300 chores on top of his chores already. Since that basically the amount she has been doing for the time that month. He was not happy but really if he just does a  ton of cleaning on the weekend it won\u2019t be that horrible, and some chores overlap.\n\nMy husband hear about it and claims I am going overboard. That it is an upsetting amount. He tried to retract the punishment but I put my foot down. AITA is this too much\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSince people asked, my daughter has the choice of take 36 days off or get extra allowance for the work she did. She hasn\u2019t chosen yet\n\nA little confusion, he is still doing daily chores but they will overlap with the 300 chore list. So you do a task it is marked off both lists. This will make him do at least 4 chores a day. Overall it will still be a total of 300 chores.

It seems fair that he could be doing the same double chores as his sister did in the same amount of time. If that is an option and you are simply giving him the option of doing them all in one weekend, that's fine. If he has to do them nonstop all weekend long, that might be excessive. I'm not sure what kind of chores you could even have where he could do them non-stop 300 in a row, so it's a bit unclear.", "NTA, 300 sounds like a lot until I did the math and that's basically what she did anyways.

He should make 288 chores, I guess the last 12 could be so he learns he can't do this kind of stuff to his sister. Why does your husband has an issue with it? Is he unable to calculate?

As I understand it, you are wanting him to experience the exact same thing he inflicted on his sister.  That's okay by my logic and hopefully will discourage his doing this again.  Of course the worst part is that he lied to her to get her to do this.

You are diving the chores fairly, and the only way in which you would be TA is if you back down with making your son complete the chores.", "You messed up mom!!!!

I would have let him done the daughters chores for a month or so, that's it. Or I would have let the daughter pick a couple of course for him to do, so she gets to be in control. \n\nThe thing that I don't really like here, is that you and your husband didn't discuss this in advance. I think you as a couple should have decided the right punishment, not you by yourself", "If your husband think youre going overboard. Spread the punishment out over 2 months instead of 1.

Your punishment is fair and measured, perhaps even a little light as it reimburses your daughter for the chores he tricked her into doing, but does not really take into account the pain of being lied to by her brother.

Proof of me trying all semester to get him to do his share or at least meet up with him. \n\nHe got a 0 for our biggest project for the course because he didn't do any work.

You should adapt it for the teenagers because otherwise you're infantilising them and setting them up to fail as soon as they leave home. Especially within their personal spaces. At least two of your kids are at the age where they can start to self manage and be more integrative with household chores without you having to outline it and break it down by daily expectations.", "NTA what you\u2019re doing is mostly just evening things out I\u2019d also make him come up with a way to make amends with her.", "Nta if he pushed his chores onto her for a month, then he gets her chores for a month.
