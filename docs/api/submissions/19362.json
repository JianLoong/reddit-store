She hasn\u2019t chosen yet\n\nA little confusion, he is still doing daily chores but they will overlap with the 300 chore list. So you do a task it is marked off both lists.

That\u2019s totally doable, given that the daughter was able to do it by herself.", "And even if it didn\u2019t he learns the value of hard work.", "I would ask your husband why your son doing this amount of work is so egregious when it\u2019s the same amount your daughter has been doing this whole time.", "I agree. I didn't see the dishes as being a punishment. Only when it felt excessive. When a child has a very difficult day and you insist they do 4 chores that isn't helping them. Other examples would be during exam season or long shifts (like 9+ hours). As a parent it is your job to care for your child (which includes keeping the house reasonably clean)\n\nIf both children have 4 chores each. That's 8 chores in total every day. That's a lot for any kid. I get it if you quite literally don't have the time to do it and ask your kids to help around or at least not to make a mess and clean up after themselves but when they take care of all or most of the household tasks all the time that's when it's excessive. \n\nImo you should either pick 1 or 2 simple chores for children and adults staying at home can do the more difficult ones or you get them to help you with each chore. Children shouldn't be cleaning everything all by themselves", "Yep. I would bring that up every time he or husband try to cry about how unfair it is", "u/Labryuiopyu stole and mangled this comment from u/Dense-Store8986", "Honestly your 300 number is really dumb and confusing. Don\u2019t count his existing chores, count the extra. So he\u2019s getting 156 extra chores. (Which is just paying back his sister plus 3 days extra.)", "This is only fair if he does HER chores like she did his. She didn't get to pick and choose from a list of chores that she wanted to do and when she wanted to do them. She was tricked into doing her brother's chores. So he should do her chores for the same number of days and then some extra for punishment.\n  \nThe chores are only part of it. He got to enjoy 1 month of no chores and made his sister pay for it. His sister should get the same privilege and then extra because she did nothing wrong.", "YTA\n\nThis is over the top and ridiculously complex.\n\nJust have her do his chores for the same amount of time she did his.", "> We have a chore chart, my three children have to 4 chores a day\n\nMaybe try actual parenting instead of \"chore charts\"", "NTA\n\nI mean, this is a lesson for him. If you try to be lazy and pawn off your tasks by lying to people, it will come back to bite you in the ass. I think it's a pretty fitting punishment, especially since he has time to finish it.", "NTA\n\nThat is a very creative and not at all unfair punishment! this will definitely show him that doing just the couple chores assigned is not nearly as bad as all of them... as well as teach him to not use his siter like that or lie!", "Nta.  The scammer should have payback..", "nta.. he   pushed his work off onto sister.  so now her work gets added to his.  \n\n\nif your husband THINKS  it is okay for his son to take advantage of his little sister, i would be sitting down and having a long talk to him.", "If I were you I would sit down with your husband, sooner rather than later, and discuss why he is more upset about your son being punished for something he did than the fact that he lied to your daughter to get out of his responsibilities. Favoritism and misogyny are not good looks.", "We got way worse when we were kids man, for doing way less. I think you know you aren't the asshole here.", "Make him do his and her chores for 36 days", "NTA, but I\u2019m confused as to how your son was able to lie to your daughter and she was doing extra chores without you or your spouse noticing? I know you said you were at work but who is at home with them when they do chores?", "NTA. A perfectly fair punishment. I wouldn't pay him allowance for them...", "NTA. A perfectly fair punishment. I wouldn't pay him allowance for them...", "NTA. I think this is fair.", "NTA. That's about the most appropriate punishment you could possibly have given your son.", " NTA. How is you husband saying you went overboard when the kid made his sister to that amount of chores??? I\u2019m getting the feeling he did this because dad has tried to protects him before from punishments.", "I will probably get downvoted for this, but here it goes:\n\nYTA.\n\nKids are not your slaves. Yes, we need to teach them how-to and the whys of household maintenance, but this isnt the wild wild west where we need every able farmhand to work the land. Obviously, your kids consider it punishing enough that 1) your son would find a way to pawn it off and 2) your daughter would be hurt by the \\[increased\\] workload. This is further evidenced by the fact that even your husband agrees the Puritan Chore Checklist has gone too far.\n\nHow about just letting them be kids? Life is shitty enough as a adult, you dont need to take away their childhood too.\n\nThat 20 minutes could be better spent doing something enriching for their lives long term, rather than sweeping because your too cheap to get a roomba.\n\n**And for the downvoters- from RULE 2, \"DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam\"**", "NTA. I wasn't really following the math, but 8 chores a day multiplied by 30 days in a month equals 240 chores. So it makes sense to me.", "I don't understand: why not have him do his sister's chores for a month plus a bit extra? That would teach him about restitution", "Yes, making restitution is usually considered a punishment due to the extra time/work involved.", "Sister may not want brother cleaning her room (assuming that is one of her chores).\n\nI agree any common area chore of the sister should fall to the brother.", "Why did it take 36 days for the daughter to ask a parent why she was being given double chores?  \n\n\nDoes that sound weird to anyone else?", "Yeah and I have a feeling that the son has gotten away with other things thanks to dad and maybe the partner doesn\u2019t know.", "That's what she did though.\n\nShe just explained it in the most confusing, convoluted way possible.", "Don't punish him twice.\n\nIF she takes the money, and it comes from him, he shouldn't get extra chores.\n\nLikewise, if he gets extra chores, he shouldn't be paying her extra.", "Ah yes, the being a jerk to your sister tax", "You made this punishment super complicated. He should be doing 8 chores a day. If daughter wants month off he does hers. If she wants to be paid he does 4 other chores.", "This would be the most awful chore at my house! My daughter and I both have long hair! It\u2019s completely disgusting \ud83e\udd22", "Probably because OP \n\n1) Explained the system very badly\n\n2) Seems to think he can do most of the 300 in a weekend.\n\nHusband probably said 300 chores in a weekend is too much.", "I rolled my eyes when I read it. It has nothing to do with that. It\u2019s all about learning how to treat other people and responsibilities. It\u2019s his little sister, it could have been his little brother.", "Dude, nobody likes doing chores, that's why they're \"chores\" and not \"hobbies\". Refraining from chores as punishment isn't going to somehow make the experience more enjoyable. I guarantee you the son already knows that the ability to do things on his own is important for his independence, he's just lazy and doesn't want to do them.", "I was agreeing with her, it wasn\u00b4t sarcastic. I think it is fair too :)", "Shouldn't you just count her brothers?  \nAfter all your rule is if you do extra..her chores are chores she would have done anyway.", "Good point. OP should have a solo talk with her daughter", "R/assholetax ?", "But his sister is getting the same month off that he did.\n\nAnd he's doing her chores on top of his.\n\nIt's fair, just OP has found the most convoluted way to describe it.", "If puppy tax means somebody has to post a pic of their puppy, not sure I want to contemplate asshole tax\u2026", "I\u2019m not disagreeing on the fairness. I agree with what op said. My reply was more towards the husband saying it\u2019s to much", "The youngest (victim) is 12... \n\nI think the 12+ year old boy understands how he fucked up.", "LMAO", "If OP explained it like she did in the OP, then I get it.\n\nShe didn't just say it was 36\\*8, she has weird overlaps and seems to think her son can finish the majority of them in a weekend.\n\nSo it's 36 days worth of chores...or a weekend worth of chores?\n\nIt's confusing, convoluted and I 100% think that the husband thought she wanted him to do 300 chores in a weekend.", "That's not even a punishment. He's just resuming doing what he's supposed to do. Shouldn't he be doing 8 chores a day for 36 days?", "Humm I can see that. I was confused at her logic until she explained. If the husband thought it needed to all be done in a week I can see who he would be upset.", "You've made this way too complicated.\n\nJust have him do 8 a day for the same amount of time she did, or slightly longer.", "Having your son do her chores for what he did. That is not punishment at all. If you really want to punish your son then do so. Don't use chores. What you are doing is letting your son off pretty easy.", "Why not just have him do his sisters chores for 2 months.", "Make it simple, he does 8 chores a day for 36 days.", "Because she's overcomplicated the punishment"]}
