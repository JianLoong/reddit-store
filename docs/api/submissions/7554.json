My BIL (husband's brother) was away for college for 4 years and ended up eloping with a women he had known for 7 months. None of us knew her, not that it mattered. But we just met her for the first time back a few months ago. She seemed pleasant, a bit shy (which is to be expected) and a bit rough around the edges (no big deal at all but just like fidgety, darting her head and looking behind her shoulder like someone was standing there when no one was). We found out a short few weeks later that she has bipolar, unmedicated, so her behaviors absolutely made sense (I'm an RN, as well as a social worker, and I also have bipolar but I'm medicated). \n\nOn Saturday MIL invited the whole family down for dinner and BIL and his new wife (Hannah) show up and we got to chatting at the dinner table about her diagnosis. She brought it up, not me (but she knew I knew about it so it started as small talk I believe). Well it didn't talk long for her to dive deep in to this conversation. Using her arms and hands to talk, getting a bit loud. No problems, the family is loud so she fits right in. But then she became angry, over nothing. Started saying stuff like \"it absolutely fucking repulses me that people without bipolar try claiming they are manic when mania is strictly a bipolar thing\". I wasn't rude by any means but I did correct her, quietly, and said \"actually mania comes in all forms and is not limited to bipolar disorders. Even people with brain tumors have been known to have manic episodes.\" She immediately said I was wrong. That her doctor told her that it was strictly a bipolar thing, etc. So I just stood firm and said \"He's wrong\" and even pulled up my medical ebook to show her the paragraph that speaks on mania and everything that can cause an episode. She refused to read it so I just turned to my husband (who wasn't paying attention to us) and said \"Hunny, you're a doctor, what causes manic episodes\". He starts listing off multiple things, including manic depressive episodes, seasonal affective disorder, postpartum psychosis or schizoaffective disorder. \n\nWell Hannah was pissed. She immediately said that we were just trying to one up her and that she \"knew what she was talking about\". My husband immediately said \"obviously not if you're going to sit here, argue and gatekeep symptoms of illnesses against two medical professionals.\" He then turned and walked off, leaving us at the table with both BILs, SIL and MIL looking on. Hannah then starts crying saying I embarrassed her on purpose for no good reason other than my pride and stormed out of the room after screaming for everyone to stop staring at her. BIL is telling me I should have just shut my mouth and storms after her. I'm really confused if I'm the AH here.\n\nETA: Making an add to include some key points here. I was quiet throughout this entire conversation. I was speaking so no one else could hear, which is exactly why my husband (who was sitting directly beside me) has no idea what we were talking about until I brought him in to the conversation. She did not appear to be in any sort of episode when the conversation began, other than the first initial spew of how it repulses her (she calmed down immediately afterwards) and only slowly showed how manic she was after raising her voice at my husband for simply stating what can cause a manic episode that does not include bipolar. I was having what I thought was an academically correct conversation with an individual as small talk (mentioned in my post). She was the one who became loud and belligerent. No one at that table had any clue what me and Hannah were even talking about until Hannah started screaming at me over the table. It is my job as both a social worker and an RN to educate individuals whom are uneducated on their illness. So yes, that probably played a part. It's more dangerous to be uneducated than it is to be educated and to be blunt, her doctor giving her false information to begin with is troubling in itself.", "created_utc": 1673962412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ecdmc/aita_for_embarrassing_my_bils_new_wife_in_front/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had no idea she was manic, as she hid it well. The most telling sign that people are manic is dilated pupils. Hers were not dilated. She had one initial outburst saying she was repulsed by individuals trying to say they were manic when they didn't have bipolar, after that she calmed down. That is not common in manic episodes. Usually it is all or nothing. She was wish-washy, and again, that's not common. It's also common in manic episodes to avoid eye contact, become fidgety (bouncing a leg, clicking fingers, making subtle head movements, eyes darting back and forth) much like she was doing on our first meeting. She was also not doing any of that. So no, my industry knowledge did not immediately trigger the feeling of \"this person is currently manic\". Most of my clients have gone the steps of getting themselves medicated however and don't have episodes such as hers. It is not what I was used to. So no, I had no idea she was manic and to be quite honest, I'm not sure if she was actually manic or using mania as a crutch. We do not know this girl and we do not know how she is outside of a social environment. This very well could be a classic case of her blaming manic episodes for every thing she does (common in bipolar).", "Indulging delusion is how we get flat earthers n shit.....", "This response tells me you have very little experience tbh. I\u2019ll just leave it at that. \n\nYou should have been able to use context clues. \n\nOutburst, getting increasingly defensive, KNOWING she is unmedicated. \n\nYou acknowledge that mania comes in all forms\u2026. Yet are attempting to fit symptoms into a uniform list. \n\nMy vote of ESH remains. She isn\u2019t  excused for how she behaves unmedicated. But you just handled this incredibly poorly for someone who claims they know what they\u2019re talking about. I just find it insanely unlikely that this is how a medical professional would handle educating someone about their disorder as well.\n\nEdit: y\u2019all can downvote me all you want. But OP didn\u2019t handle this like a person with experience would. Sorry. Not sorry.", "Never said she should be indulged. I just said there\u2019s a right and wrong way to handle this. Continuously arguing with her while she\u2019s continuing to spiral, isn\u2019t smart, nor is it something anyone who knows even a little about bipolar would do.", "What type of experience do you have that warrants you trying to minimize my experience? One outburst does not at all mean that a person is manic. Are you bipolar? If so, do you have one random outburst during a manic episode and be done with it immediately following? If not, do you have emotional outbursts randomly for what appears to be nothing with a cause? Sure you do. Everyone does. One single outburst is common in everyone at some point or another and does not mean for any case in point that someone is manic. I very, very clearly stated what I was used to and even openly admitted that her behaviors are not something I was used to and you double down and call me inexperienced. I wasn't asking you to change your judgement here. I came for honest feedback and I respect your judgement. I was merely adding input to something you said to someone else, because it's embedded in my brain as a social worker to educate.", "I do hear that, like learn to manage the ppl around you n all that. I saw another comment that said she should\u2019ve used the convo to Segway into a convo about meds instead (and let that mania point go). Tricky stuff either way. To me though I don\u2019t think she was wrong per-say, but I agree it could\u2019ve been handled with more skill.", "Lmao all I said is you should be able to use context clues. Even if you didn\u2019t know for sure, you should have been able to see the situation was devolving and had the sense to divert or  deescalate. Yes I\u2019m bipolar and I don\u2019t believe for a second you\u2019re a medical professional trained in mental health or disorders. I believe you\u2019re a medical professional who has access to a text book so you think that means you\u2019re an expert on everything. But my god you just come across completely oblivious as to how to talk to someone about their illness. I get you aren\u2019t her doctor and this wasn\u2019t a medical setting  but shoving text in her face and saying \u201cyou\u2019re wrong\u201d is just totally absurd to me if you thought that was honestly going to be effective, considering the thing she had her \u201cone outburst\u201d over\u2026 was the thing you were arguing with her over. This wasn\u2019t about educating. This was about who knows more about bipolar. Which is the exact reason you\u2019re arguing with me right now. \n\nYes everyone is susceptible to those things. But she\u2019s an unmedicated bipolar person\u2026.. again\u2026. Context clues. It should have been a red flag due to that period. \n\nAlso you don\u2019t know her at all or what\u2019s normal for her. You do know she\u2019s unmedicated though. So I find it interesting that that fact alone wasn\u2019t enough for you to assess the direction the conversation was going."]}
