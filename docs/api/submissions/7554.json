My BIL (husband's brother) was away for college for 4 years and ended up eloping with a women he had known for 7 months. None of us knew her, not that it mattered. But we just met her for the first time back a few months ago. She seemed pleasant, a bit shy (which is to be expected) and a bit rough around the edges (no big deal at all but just like fidgety, darting her head and looking behind her shoulder like someone was standing there when no one was). We found out a short few weeks later that she has bipolar, unmedicated, so her behaviors absolutely made sense (I'm an RN, as well as a social worker, and I also have bipolar but I'm medicated). \n\nOn Saturday MIL invited the whole family down for dinner and BIL and his new wife (Hannah) show up and we got to chatting at the dinner table about her diagnosis. She brought it up, not me (but she knew I knew about it so it started as small talk I believe). Well it didn't talk long for her to dive deep in to this conversation. Using her arms and hands to talk, getting a bit loud. No problems, the family is loud so she fits right in. But then she became angry, over nothing. Started saying stuff like \"it absolutely fucking repulses me that people without bipolar try claiming they are manic when mania is strictly a bipolar thing\". I wasn't rude by any means but I did correct her, quietly, and said \"actually mania comes in all forms and is not limited to bipolar disorders. Even people with brain tumors have been known to have manic episodes.\" She immediately said I was wrong. That her doctor told her that it was strictly a bipolar thing, etc. So I just stood firm and said \"He's wrong\" and even pulled up my medical ebook to show her the paragraph that speaks on mania and everything that can cause an episode. She refused to read it so I just turned to my husband (who wasn't paying attention to us) and said \"Hunny, you're a doctor, what causes manic episodes\". He starts listing off multiple things, including manic depressive episodes, seasonal affective disorder, postpartum psychosis or schizoaffective disorder. \n\nWell Hannah was pissed. She immediately said that we were just trying to one up her and that she \"knew what she was talking about\". My husband immediately said \"obviously not if you're going to sit here, argue and gatekeep symptoms of illnesses against two medical professionals.\" He then turned and walked off, leaving us at the table with both BILs, SIL and MIL looking on. Hannah then starts crying saying I embarrassed her on purpose for no good reason other than my pride and stormed out of the room after screaming for everyone to stop staring at her. BIL is telling me I should have just shut my mouth and storms after her. I'm really confused if I'm the AH here.\n\nETA: Making an add to include some key points here. I was quiet throughout this entire conversation. I was speaking so no one else could hear, which is exactly why my husband (who was sitting directly beside me) has no idea what we were talking about until I brought him in to the conversation. She did not appear to be in any sort of episode when the conversation began, other than the first initial spew of how it repulses her (she calmed down immediately afterwards) and only slowly showed how manic she was after raising her voice at my husband for simply stating what can cause a manic episode that does not include bipolar. I was having what I thought was an academically correct conversation with an individual as small talk (mentioned in my post). She was the one who became loud and belligerent. No one at that table had any clue what me and Hannah were even talking about until Hannah started screaming at me over the table. It is my job as both a social worker and an RN to educate individuals whom are uneducated on their illness. So yes, that probably played a part. It's more dangerous to be uneducated than it is to be educated and to be blunt, her doctor giving her false information to begin with is troubling in itself.", "created_utc": 1673962412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ecdmc/aita_for_embarrassing_my_bils_new_wife_in_front/", "score": 2874, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She had one initial outburst saying she was repulsed by individuals trying to say they were manic when they didn't have bipolar, after that she calmed down. That is not common in manic episodes. Usually it is all or nothing. She was wish-washy, and again, that's not common. It's also common in manic episodes to avoid eye contact, become fidgety (bouncing a leg, clicking fingers, making subtle head movements, eyes darting back and forth) much like she was doing on our first meeting. She was also not doing any of that. So no, my industry knowledge did not immediately trigger the feeling of \"this person is currently manic\". Most of my clients have gone the steps of getting themselves medicated however and don't have episodes such as hers. It is not what I was used to. So no, I had no idea she was manic and to be quite honest, I'm not sure if she was actually manic or using mania as a crutch.

One outburst does not at all mean that a person is manic. Are you bipolar? If so, do you have one random outburst during a manic episode and be done with it immediately following? If not, do you have emotional outbursts randomly for what appears to be nothing with a cause? Sure you do. Everyone does. One single outburst is common in everyone at some point or another and does not mean for any case in point that someone is manic.

I get manic. It's not strictly a bipolar issue, because those conditions are under the same \"family\" diagnosis - my mother is bipolar, so my family has seen plenty of mania. \n\nSIL made this far too personal for her own good, and it sounds like she uses her illness to excuse or dismiss her behaviors and is using it as a shield to protect herself from medical choices that would benefit her. Hence the whole \"I hate how others claim this vastly debilitating symptom, why should they get X,Y,Z excuse when it should strictly be for my own gain...?\" Thats how her comment reads, at least to me anyway. \n\nShe was looking for a bias to cling to and her doctor idiotically gave her one since he has a level of \"authority\" and a rapport with her, even though that is clearly wrong and misguided in every way, if not extremely dangerous. Mania is no laughing matter, doesn't matter what diagnosis. Unfortunately, with many unmedicated or untreated individuals, it's easy for them to warp the perspective on themselves (Their minds are their own worst enemy) and it creates a narrative that turns any conversation into a personal attack. \n\nI have tried medication, and while it helps the chemistry, there is an equally important part which is behavioral and thought pattern based. It took a lot of work for me to get out of the mindset of viewing someone's conversations WITH me (Not at) as a personal attack, but I assure you, it is well worth the work to stop being sooooo strung up on every persons words and my perceived attacks from them - they were entirely baseless and had no sound reasoning.\n\nIt sounds like SIL should at least get some behavioral help. I'd definitely look into medication too if she gets so  high strung that she's fidgety, perceptions are altering, etc. Thats of course assuming she wants to.

My daughter has BPD and it's been a roller coaster ride. And not a fun one at times. She has pissed a lot of people off along the way. Even family members who do not understand what she is going through. Jobs she's lost. Relationships ruined. It's heartbreaking as a mother to watch her go through this.

It makes no sense to me to stop taking a medication without clearing it with my doctor, but when it\u2019s your mental health, and your illness is telling you that you know your body better than the doctor\u2026 it must be a regular struggle.", "Is this a trend? My freshman year roommate (random match so we did not know each other) also decided that starting college was great timing to take herself off her bipolar meds. I couldn't move out and the RA's only solution was for me to call her mother. Which actually worked, thank god, her mother came and took her home and she reappeared a month later back on her meds and no longer doing stuff like screaming and threatening to beat me up when I asked her to turn off her music at three am. But she hated me for that and it definitely continued to be unpleasant until the year finally ended.", "Oof, thankfully it never got to a point where he was actively violent. But he certainly made threats, and there was one time I think he was planning to assault me, but I happened to not be home at the time.", "My grandmother's boyfriend would NOT believe that smoking around babies was bad. He was old and smoker, his dad was old when he died and he smoked, BF smoked around his kids and they are fine. Nothing I could say, would change his mind. There were no studies that he would believe because he didn't have lung cancer. All I could do was keep my kid away from him. Even without mental illness, some people pick weird hills to die on. I knew smoking around young babies was a bad, so I had to control me and my kids, not him.", "I see your point. OP is allowed to stand up for herself. OP will never get the wife to agree, though. Wife has a fundamental misunderstanding of her medical condition. And is clinging to it. A boundary of \"I won't talk medical stuff/mental health stuff\" would be appropriate.", "Yeah and they aren't on the job and Hannah isn't their patient...\n\nI love how you just hand wave all responsibility off Hannah for her own outrageous behavior and expect everyone else to cater to her.  Despite the fact that Hannah is unwilling to cater to anyone else or even do right by herself by not treating her disease.", "Yes ... & of course because they are medical professionals they know the best time & place to tell someone they are wrong is when they are already agitated at a dinner party. FFS ... Not an ounce of care or concern for this woman. This was not a teaching moment. This conversation was not necessary nor was it helpful information for Hannah. This was about knowing more than someone else ... I have no idea why that was important. I guess prove to themselves they know more than everyone else.", "In most cases no, but in this, your examples don't really jive. A bipolar person tells me I'm not having a magic episode because I \"can't\" if I'm not bipolar, then I go to my doctor to find out wtf is wrong with me. I don't assume it's just nothing because I haven't been diagnosed yet. \nThe non medicated part, some people go on and off their meds all the time. If this woman has convinced herself she doesn't need them, her sister in law fighting with her about it over dinner isn't going to help her, or the next person.", "I don't doubt that actually. It's not like there's always a one size fits all approach.\n\nHowever, there is literature for spouses of people with BPD. One literally called Stop Walking on Eggshells that has been recommended by a few therapists I've worked with.\n\nSo maybe I'm biased, but there's two things I personally believe are lacking from various relationships as I see it **everywhere**.\n\n* People with mental illness(or sometimes just shitty asocial personalities) attempting to make their issues the responsibility of others instead of taking ownership of their issues.\n\n* People not setting boundaries and expectations with those people. Something I was once personally guilty of, so maybe I'm biased. i.e. learning how to not be a doormat.", "It's really not human nature to refuse to listen to others when their beliefs are challenged, is the nature of ignorant people. I have changed my opinions both politically and academically drastically upon hearing new information, it's not normal to just refuse to listen to others, it's a terrible trait that she should work on.", "But you have to educate in an environment and at a time conductive to correction. There is no trust between these two. They are barely family. This was not the time or setting to correct someone who is upset. It's a disservice to try and \"educate\" that way.", "Considering it was a conversation between family members I highly doubt OP approached it with the goal to accomplish anything in paticular.", "Setting boundaries and expectations. I.e. just because you're unstable doesn't mean it's other's responsibility to manage your mental illness.", "The hell are you even talking about? The closest she got to talking about SILs healthcare was calling the doctor wrong. Which he is.\n\nDiscussing an illness != Discussing healthcare.", "I have had that exact same conversation with my mum as well, literally any topic can turn into self-victimisation and it\u2019s *exhausting*. At one point I just stopped talking to her but that was also wrong and led to a fight lmao. Hate when I talk, hate when I don\u2019t talk.", "\"Man I feel terrible.\"\n\n\"Here take this medication, it will make you feel better!\"\n\n\"I FEEL GREAT! I DON'T NEED THIS MEDICINE ANYMORE!\"\n\n\"...man, I feel terrible.\"", "Ya I dont wanna trivialize people's struggles with how their body changes with medication like that. But going off your meds the year you start taking classes related to your major, move in with your boyfriend for the first time, and move in three people you've known about a year, while paying bills for the first time (she moved from dorms where everything is one payment) and decide that thats the best time to address the issues is... well it is a choice a 21 year old would make to put it nicely. I hope she's better now but she targetted me and made my life miserable and I spiraled bad with her constant harassment. So, I find it hard to have sympathy. Plus she got what she wanted when I left, which was my boyfriend.", "50% of people with bipolar are not med compliant. It is an extremely difficult disorder in which some of the symptoms can be believing you are fine, or believing you don't need treatment. I am very grateful that I don't experience that symptom, as I am also bipolar", "Yeah, this roommate was never violent towards other living things, just towards walls and his own belongings. So I guess it could be worse? But it can also be a lot better, especially with medication.", "Oh yes I did do that because she was a guest! At a dinner party. Have you hosted a dinner before? Have you been a guest at a dinner? Most people would wait until they actually get to know people a little bit more before arguing with them & being so incredibly condescending. Most polite people would choose not to escalate this situation knowing they are at a dinner party & speaking to an already agitated person. The etiquette here would be to avoid this entire situation. Let Hannah be wrong... who cares!", "Are you telling me if you were a guest at a dinner party & you disagreed with a doctor & they responded in the way this \u201cdoctor\u201d did you would be fine with that??? WHAT?!? That was an asshole response. OMG!!! \n\nMaybe I\u2019m the ah here & the medical professionals in my family are a little bit more professional & caring.", "You don't agree to disagree about health, especially as a doctor/rn, period.\n(Unless, like another commentor said, they have solid evidence in your field and have had a peer review.)\n\nIt is dangerous. The end. Period.\n\nShe may not harm someone else, but she could harm herself with this information. You do not spread false information about health related issues, and as any form of medical professional, you sure as hell don't allow them to be spread.", "[It literally is a well-documented phenomenon of human nature called The Backfire Effect.](https://effectiviology.com/backfire-effect-facts-dont-change-minds/)\n\nBut either way...there are still much better ways to go about it. This woman is around a bunch of new people and OP just dunked on her.\n\nWhy? Why was it OPs job to police this bit of misinformation at the dinner table?\n\nYou can be right and still be the asshole.", "THEN WHY PULL OUT TEXTBOOKS? Come on bro", "Here\u2019s the thing: mood stabilizers (aka antipsychotics, typical and atypical) are not without distressing side effects. They often cause weight gain, hirsutism (growth of facial hair on individuals of female sex) and feelings of numbness and malaise. So unfortunately, it does make sense that people would want to not be on them. \n\nFurther, many people in the US are put on these meds but do not have access to quality counseling, or options to change up therapies if a certain type doesn\u2019t meet their needs. Medication is only one piece of the puzzle. Therapy can help individuals gain insight into their cognitive and behavioral patterns. Without said insight, mania and depression can impair impulse control, especially in people without coping skills/distress tolerance. \n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on internalized stigmatization. Its all a major bummer.", "The thing is, mania often feels great. It just can be super destructive to your life and others. So your dialog isn't really how it works when medicating for hypomania/mania. Because the medication can easily make you feel less vibrant/creative/joyous but gives you that control back to some degree.", "Nailed it!", "> Plus she got what she wanted when I left, which was my boyfriend.\n\nWell, if it's any consolation, he probably got what he deserved.", "Other people that have manic episodes care. People like Hannah piss me off because they think they're always correct and try to invalidate the struggles of others because they think they are the only ones suffering.", "I interact with lots of professionals from other fields. I find I'm constantly learning things that am incorrect about, and I've never had a breakdown over being corrected.  That's a not-normal reaction, and it's Hannah's responsibility as she is the one aware of her issues and should be receiving treatment.", "Okay. Clearly that worked here right?", "I pull out my phone to double check info in casual conversation all the time. So do the other people talking. It's a pretty easy way to figure out what's up, though you'll sometimes hit a lot of conflicting info on a topic, or just fail to find info at all. I can say, personally, I wouldn't have an issue if someone did that to me, as it happens somewhat regularly already. Sometimes you're right. Sometimes you're wrong. SIL lost her shit over it. Whether you want to blame it on an untreated illness or just SIL being an asshole, it's not on OP. And I say this as someone with their own issues. You know what I've done in the exact situation as SIL? Reflected on my actions and apologized. Because I'm the one responsible for my own actions.", "Because if someone is arguing their point based entirely on \"someone told me\" you prove your point. \n\nThat's common sense. When people prove you wrong do you get upset too? \n\n\nIt's like my mom getting mad at me for googling something when she refuses to trust me on topics I'm an expert of. Like, you could have taken my word, you didn't, so i proved it.", ">This wasn\u2019t about educating. This was about who knows more about bipolar. Which is the exact reason you\u2019re arguing with me right now. \n\nThat's exactly what you've been doing since your first comment. Claiming OP, medical care provider with bipolar, must not ACTUALLY know bipolar, but you do because...you have bipolar so you must know more?\n\nYou've been very aggressive with your comments from the start and I have a feeling that's a big part of why you're getting down voted. It's a little too similar to OP's SIL. \"You don't know anything, bc I don't think you do\" yikes.", "Oooh boy he got more than he expected. Life lesson for him for sure.", "The fact that you\u2019re taking my comments as aggressive is ridiculous to me. I\u2019ve simply been arguing that OP clearly was antagonizing someone clearly having an episode. OP is medicated. The girl in the post is not. When you\u2019re medicated vs not, things things are a lot different. Op would have recognized warning signs if she was exposed to unmedicated people frequently. She\u2019s also trying to fit SIL into a box, which isn\u2019t how bipolar works. Also OP might be an RN but I can tell you now she doesn\u2019t work within mental health very often. There\u2019s absolutely no way she does based on how she handled this. And I stand by that opinion.\n\nI didn\u2019t say OP doesn\u2019t know anytbing. I said what she knows is probably limited to text book definition and she should have let it go because of that. Don\u2019t tackle a topic if all you can source is what the medical book says and no range of things outside of that. OP used her credentials to justify herself. She\u2019s the one who brought them up. Nuff said.\n\nIf I seem aggressive it\u2019s because I\u2019m seeing through OP\u2019s behavior which everyone else is ignoring."]}
