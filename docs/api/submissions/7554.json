My BIL (husband's brother) was away for college for 4 years and ended up eloping with a women he had known for 7 months. None of us knew her, not that it mattered. But we just met her for the first time back a few months ago. She seemed pleasant, a bit shy (which is to be expected) and a bit rough around the edges (no big deal at all but just like fidgety, darting her head and looking behind her shoulder like someone was standing there when no one was). We found out a short few weeks later that she has bipolar, unmedicated, so her behaviors absolutely made sense (I'm an RN, as well as a social worker, and I also have bipolar but I'm medicated). \n\nOn Saturday MIL invited the whole family down for dinner and BIL and his new wife (Hannah) show up and we got to chatting at the dinner table about her diagnosis. She brought it up, not me (but she knew I knew about it so it started as small talk I believe). Well it didn't talk long for her to dive deep in to this conversation. Using her arms and hands to talk, getting a bit loud. No problems, the family is loud so she fits right in. But then she became angry, over nothing. Started saying stuff like \"it absolutely fucking repulses me that people without bipolar try claiming they are manic when mania is strictly a bipolar thing\". I wasn't rude by any means but I did correct her, quietly, and said \"actually mania comes in all forms and is not limited to bipolar disorders. Even people with brain tumors have been known to have manic episodes.\" She immediately said I was wrong. That her doctor told her that it was strictly a bipolar thing, etc. So I just stood firm and said \"He's wrong\" and even pulled up my medical ebook to show her the paragraph that speaks on mania and everything that can cause an episode. She refused to read it so I just turned to my husband (who wasn't paying attention to us) and said \"Hunny, you're a doctor, what causes manic episodes\". He starts listing off multiple things, including manic depressive episodes, seasonal affective disorder, postpartum psychosis or schizoaffective disorder. \n\nWell Hannah was pissed. She immediately said that we were just trying to one up her and that she \"knew what she was talking about\". My husband immediately said \"obviously not if you're going to sit here, argue and gatekeep symptoms of illnesses against two medical professionals.\" He then turned and walked off, leaving us at the table with both BILs, SIL and MIL looking on. Hannah then starts crying saying I embarrassed her on purpose for no good reason other than my pride and stormed out of the room after screaming for everyone to stop staring at her. BIL is telling me I should have just shut my mouth and storms after her. I'm really confused if I'm the AH here.\n\nETA: Making an add to include some key points here. I was quiet throughout this entire conversation. I was speaking so no one else could hear, which is exactly why my husband (who was sitting directly beside me) has no idea what we were talking about until I brought him in to the conversation. She did not appear to be in any sort of episode when the conversation began, other than the first initial spew of how it repulses her (she calmed down immediately afterwards) and only slowly showed how manic she was after raising her voice at my husband for simply stating what can cause a manic episode that does not include bipolar. I was having what I thought was an academically correct conversation with an individual as small talk (mentioned in my post). She was the one who became loud and belligerent. No one at that table had any clue what me and Hannah were even talking about until Hannah started screaming at me over the table. It is my job as both a social worker and an RN to educate individuals whom are uneducated on their illness. So yes, that probably played a part. It's more dangerous to be uneducated than it is to be educated and to be blunt, her doctor giving her false information to begin with is troubling in itself.", "created_utc": 1673962412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ecdmc/aita_for_embarrassing_my_bils_new_wife_in_front/", "score": 8007, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She had one initial outburst saying she was repulsed by individuals trying to say they were manic when they didn't have bipolar, after that she calmed down. That is not common in manic episodes. Usually it is all or nothing. She was wish-washy, and again, that's not common. It's also common in manic episodes to avoid eye contact, become fidgety (bouncing a leg, clicking fingers, making subtle head movements, eyes darting back and forth) much like she was doing on our first meeting. She was also not doing any of that. So no, my industry knowledge did not immediately trigger the feeling of \"this person is currently manic\". Most of my clients have gone the steps of getting themselves medicated however and don't have episodes such as hers. It is not what I was used to. So no, I had no idea she was manic and to be quite honest, I'm not sure if she was actually manic or using mania as a crutch.

One outburst does not at all mean that a person is manic. Are you bipolar? If so, do you have one random outburst during a manic episode and be done with it immediately following? If not, do you have emotional outbursts randomly for what appears to be nothing with a cause? Sure you do. Everyone does. One single outburst is common in everyone at some point or another and does not mean for any case in point that someone is manic.

I get manic. It's not strictly a bipolar issue, because those conditions are under the same \"family\" diagnosis - my mother is bipolar, so my family has seen plenty of mania. \n\nSIL made this far too personal for her own good, and it sounds like she uses her illness to excuse or dismiss her behaviors and is using it as a shield to protect herself from medical choices that would benefit her. Hence the whole \"I hate how others claim this vastly debilitating symptom, why should they get X,Y,Z excuse when it should strictly be for my own gain...?\" Thats how her comment reads, at least to me anyway. \n\nShe was looking for a bias to cling to and her doctor idiotically gave her one since he has a level of \"authority\" and a rapport with her, even though that is clearly wrong and misguided in every way, if not extremely dangerous. Mania is no laughing matter, doesn't matter what diagnosis. Unfortunately, with many unmedicated or untreated individuals, it's easy for them to warp the perspective on themselves (Their minds are their own worst enemy) and it creates a narrative that turns any conversation into a personal attack. \n\nI have tried medication, and while it helps the chemistry, there is an equally important part which is behavioral and thought pattern based. It took a lot of work for me to get out of the mindset of viewing someone's conversations WITH me (Not at) as a personal attack, but I assure you, it is well worth the work to stop being sooooo strung up on every persons words and my perceived attacks from them - they were entirely baseless and had no sound reasoning.\n\nIt sounds like SIL should at least get some behavioral help. I'd definitely look into medication too if she gets so  high strung that she's fidgety, perceptions are altering, etc. Thats of course assuming she wants to.

My daughter has BPD and it's been a roller coaster ride. And not a fun one at times. She has pissed a lot of people off along the way. Even family members who do not understand what she is going through. Jobs she's lost. Relationships ruined. It's heartbreaking as a mother to watch her go through this.

Autism and adhd traits are all disorders\u2026and so on. Similarly, mainstream media and entertainment display bipolar as the poster disorder for manic episodes. And yes, many psychiatrists also go that way. I, like many others, have been misdiagnosed for a reason.

The only difference is that you were indeed right and she was indeed wrong, but it's concerning how you didn't just drop the subject when you saw that she was getting aggravated and you saw that she clearly wasn't going to change her mind even after you gave her sources she could read to realize she was in the wrong. You kept pushing her buttons, and for what reason? You are a professional OP, you should know better than to egg on an unmedicated mentally ill person who is showing warning signs of getting more and more explosive but instead of doing anything to change the topic you just continued engaging with her on this. When you brought in your husband into the discussion, Hannah probably felt like she was being ganged up on which perhaps contributed in making her reaction even more explosive. Even worse when your husband replied the way he did. I agree that correcting misinformation is important, but as soon as you saw she wasn't taking it well you should've dropped it like a hot potato. Hannah seems like one of those flat earthers (to use a popular example) whom you could show mountains of evidence about why that isn't correct but they'd still dig their heels in, cover their ears, and continue insisting until they die about why it's flat. \n\nYou can't make people understand what they are unwilling to understand in the first place. Both of you handled this very immaturely, her by having the outburst and you by continuing to engage in this extremely unproductive discussion with an unmedicated mentally ill person nonetheless in order to prove a point and hence sacrificing what could've otherwise been a pacific family dinner. Sure, Hannah is the one responsible for her own outburst but it also can't be denied that it could've been prevented by changing the topic of conversation into something less heavy. I do believe that you started off with good intentions trying to battle misinformation but I believe you let your pride take over at the end. The worst part is that it seems Hannah didn't actually learn anything from this, still believes that she's right, will continue spreading misinformation, and now a family dinner was ruined.

If anything its gives better tact on HOW and WHEN to deliver the truth. This dinner setting, the fact they have no relationship nor trust with SIL and she seemed unstable and nervous prior are signs this isn't the best time to challenge her. OP pulled an egotistical stunt just to be right. I think the SIL was probably trying to vent about how terms like manic etc. are used casually like \" the weather is so bipolar. One day it's hot the next is cold.\" That stuff is irritating and she was visibly agitated when she said  that according to OP. Not an ideal state of mind to have a rational conversation. It's also disheartening OP doesn't get that considering the field she works in, there are plenty of people like OP when tact is very crucial to combat flawed ideas and reasoning.  Empathy allows us to have critical judgment with these situations.", "SIL wanted to talk about it though. Presumably she would be open to the idea of learning something from a medical professional, if she initiated the conversation. It's not on everyone else to be patronizing and pretend you know more than you do about something when you're wrong.  It's a lot to ask of someone to NOT correct people when discussing their own specialties. SIL may have been offended at being told she was wrong, but it's also offensive to discount the knowledge of an expert on a subject they should know more about than you. \n\nI can see where there was a hint of hostility coming out before that point, and really OP could have let matter go when it looked like she was unreceptive to this correction. But her only mistake was giving her more credit than she deserved on being capable of having a rational discussion right then, and being interested in learning anything.  \n\nShe clearly just wanted an echo chamber that told her she was right and that only people with her particular disorder can suffer in the way that she does. I hope she can find a helpful medication, therapy techniques, or some kind of solution; because always being the irrational one who no one dares contradict, because you'll freak out, is no way to live. \n\nNTA.

Hannah is likely not thinking about other disorders that include mania, but probably trying to commiserate with another bipolar person about how it can be hurtful when people who are not manic claim mania (\"I put on my favorite song and just dance the whole time, I'm so manic!\").  She was probably looking for an understanding from someone she expects will have the same frustration, but was instead \"well akshully'd\" about the disorder she is struggling with by someone she thought she could trust to understand her.\n\nThere's a time and place for correcting people, and sometimes picking the wrong time to do it is just going to exacerbate things.  OP obviously triggered an episode by failing to see the need that Hannah was trying to address.  A better approach would probably have been \"oh, I understand.  It can be so frustrating when people belittle symptoms like that.  At least we aren't alone though, X,Y,Z can also get manic episodes so at least we have some other friends, haha\" rather than \"Oh, no, you're wrong [and your feelings are also wrong, let me tell you how wrong you are about everything.

I can see where OP and her husband were coming from though, because there are definitely those who try to isolate symptoms to only the condition the individual has or the condition the symptom is most commonly associated with. I agree with the NAH judgement. OP probably should have tried to get clarification on what Hannah meant, but I can't blame her for sticking to her guns. The medical community has to deal with a lot of misinformation being passed around and I'm sure that it must be very frustrating to go through all that school and know they have the evidence to back their position while others argue that matters of science are subject to opinion.", "What possible intent?\n\n\u201cOnly bipolar people can have manic episodes\u201d. Seems pretty clear. Both OP and Hannah have BPD. Manic episodes is not just for BPD. There is no other possible intent in the message from Hannah.", "Not really. She's incorrect and trying to spread that misinformation in both situations, and in both situations she is gatekeeping a symptom of her disorder that is not exclusive to her disorder.

We are used to reasoning with other people but that doesn't really work with dementia.  The better way is to distract, not argue.", "Sorry for the insanely long answer in advance.\n\nFamily often if they're caregivers, through not entirely a fault of their own. It's hard as hell to see your loved one like that. Some families are actually terrible, but most are just frustrated and scared.\n\nProfessionals, it depends. In my country we have separate dementia wards/buildings in most care homes or homes dedicated entirely to dementia, so most people who work there solely work with people with dementia. Those are usually professional and patient.\n\nIt does sometimes happen that when a new student or someone who usually works on somatic care (like me lol) starts working in a dementia ward, they argue with dementia patients. Usually it's the coworkers that are quite bottom of the barrel when it comes to intelligence, though. Students could be making an honest mistake.\n\nIn most cases it's just a fundamental difference in work between wards. If you send somatic workers to a dementia ward, you'll likely end up with some distressed and/or upset patients because of verbal mishaps (though not as bad as actual arguing usually, usually it's shit like \"i didnt know the guy who said he lost his wallet says this every day and i helped him look for it and now he's overturning the entire building trying to find it but he doesnt have a wallet wtf do i do\"), and if you send dementia ward workers to a somatic ward you'll likely end up with some garbage wound care and colleagues who haven't operated a patient lift in 7 years.\n\nVery rarely you will find a professional that works on a dementia ward and argues with patients about their perception of reality. Usually on wards where only 1 person is available so there's no one to check them. At some point they get found out and either transferred to somatics or fired depending on how big the staff shortage is. Considering the shortage country wide is about 50k, growing yearly and yearly only about 6-7k people choose this line of education and they don't all graduate and start working and people are dropping out because of the aftermath of covid that wrecks their mental health, the shortage is dire enough to transfer instead of fire for a lot of places.", ">\"it absolutely fucking repulses me that people without bipolar try claiming they are manic when mania is strictly a bipolar thing\" \n\nYou're focusing only on the second half of the original statement.  Just like OP did.  I view it a different way.  \n\nHow many people actually go around talking about being manic all the time?  Yes obviously OP is factually correct that someone with a freakin' brain tumor can also have mania, but how common is that?  Or is Hannah more likely reacting to people *misusing* the term mania?  \n\nLike it's common, but not appropriate, for boomers to call teen girls 'manic' because they have high energy and shrill voices.  Men dismiss women's feelings as PMS or manic-depressive episodes all the time.  Someone obsessed with a hobby will say they are a maniac over it.  Someone reacting strongly to a genuine disappointment will get dismissed as being manic.  Or even just using it as a form of exaggeration, like \"literally\" has been watered down over the years.  \n\nIMO all of that happens way more often than the medical examples OP shared.  So why was it so hard for OP to just say \"Yea it sucks when people misuse a specific medical term and end up making fun of your condition, please pass the salad?\"", "Ah, I didn't see the edit when I was commenting.
