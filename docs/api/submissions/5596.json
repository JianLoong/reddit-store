English isn't my first language, sorry for any mistakes.\n\nI (39m) have a son Carl(9m) with my wife (35f). Carl is usually a good kid, does well in school, does all of his homework, helps around the house and is all around well behaved. His best friend Peter (10m) is spoiled. He gets whatever he wants anytime, breaks School rules, does what he wants to his parents and other kids  and throws tantrums whenever something is not like he wants it to be. I have met Peters parents in School and at birthday parties. They are nice people but whenever Peter doesn't get his way, they start trying to calm him down and try getting him whatever he wants so that he would calm down. \n\nSo at the issue at hand. For the last couple of months Carl's behaviour has been changing. He became more bratty, started arguing with us. We have talked it through with my wife about his behaviour and came to the conclusion that maybe he is starting to go through puberty earlier than usually. \n\nBut later he started complaining, that we are not that great compared to Peters parents. In his words peters parents got him everything he wanted, he didn't have to go to bed on time, he doesn't have to help around etc. Well it did tic me off a little, but I dismissed it.\n\nSo 4 days ago Carl came to me and said he wants to get his Christmas gift early, because Peter already got his. I said no because we were having a family get together and we would open presents as a family on that day. Well that didn't sit right with Carl cause he started throwing a fit and saying that he hated us and that Peters parents were so much better. I was getting angry but holding myself together. But then he started breaking stuff and went full brat. At that moment I was angry and got a hold of his hands so that he would stop and said that now he won't be getting his present from us. This made him cry because he knew we got him a Nintendo Switch. He ran into his room and stayed there the whole day only coming down to eat dinner where he didn't speak to us. My wife said I was a little too harsh on him, but I stayed firm that I was right. He did apologize later and I said he still won't be getting his Christmas present. He was sad but accepting of it. Now after seeing him apologize and not get angry when I denied him getting his present this year, I feel like maybe I was a little to harsh on him and should give him his present. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Reading all of your comments and taking notes of what I should do. When wife comes home we will talk on what we will do.\n\nEdit 2: So me and my wife have talked this through and feel that maybe I was being harsh. We agreed that Peter is being a bad influence on our son and we will talk to the school that if maybe it is possible for us to change to a parallel class where he is not there. If that is not possible we will think of changing schools. We talked and explained to Carl that Peter is a bad influence and that we don't want him to be around him, he can't go over to his house or spend time with him (he does have other friends he likes spending time with). Then we talked about his Christmas gift. We explained that he had 2 choices: 1. Until the New Year he has to help around the house more and without showing his displeasure ( help buy groceries, shovel snow, help us clean, walk the dog etc.), we take away his electronics until the 31st and he is half grounded( he can go out with his friends for sledding and stuff but he can't go over someone's house)2. He can get his switch on his birthday ( march). He was happy he could get his switch and chose the first option. He hugged us and promised to be better. He is in much better mood and is happy we let him still have a chance to get his present.", "created_utc": 1671961995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuv55y/aita_for_punishing_my_child/", "score": 672, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would be looking at options to separate the boys. This friendship will not serve your son well as they head into the more vulnerable teenage years where peers are more important than parents. My son had a very close friendship with a kid who was getting progressively out of control and seeing the adults in his world responses was alarming. I happened to be studying drug & alcohol and psychology etc at the time, and there were varied things that were confronting me as a parent about the future for the boys seeing the dynamic of their relationship and surrounding adults. Anyway, I took my son out of that school and the relationship ended. We ran into him years later... He'd been in juvenile detention, drug rehab and was no longer at school. It was really sad to see this 15 yr old but the writing was on the wall and no one was interested in what I had to say. Parents were very wealthy and executives so had it under control.", "NTA.

You are reacting in the exact opposite way to a temper tantrum than Peter's parents would, which is good.  Kids test boundaries -- Carl sees Peter getting whatever he wants through demands and tantrums.  Carl wants to see if the same tactics would work for him.

Also that you are sorry that he thinks his friend's family is better as you try really hard to take care of his needs. Let him tell you what he thinks is better in the other family. If he refers to material things, tell him, that although he may think now otherwise, money is not the most important thing. If he complains about lack of attention to him- try to give him more of that. Harsh punishment will only make him overtly obey you, but secretly hate you. Unless, that's  what you want\n\nYTA.", "NTA. Too many kids are growing up entitled and throw a fit when they don\u2019t get their own way. You are not overly harsh.

And if he does have another similar tantrum dont hesitate to take it with no return.\n\nThen play for an hour with him for the first game as a bonding exercise.\n\nThen honestly you and your wife figure out how to separate these two boys - as he is not a good influence", "Punishing him was appropriate, but taking away his Christmas present entirely wasn't something you should have done without talking to your wife, and sounds like too much, unless you've left out a lot of information. YTA.", "Well, I mean, he was throwing a tantrum because he has a shitty friend who is influencing his behavior. He\u2019s only 9. He is not going to fully grasp the concept of how upsetting his behavior is because he is still a child, but that does *not* excuse him from acting this way.\n\nNow, to be fair, I do think that you would not be doing the right thing by refusing to give him his gift on Christmas Day because I believe the most fulfilling thing in a parent\u2019s life (well, in my own life for sure) is seeing their eyes light up and their happiness when they get to open their gifts. I don\u2019t know how else to describe that feeling, but for me it\u2019s euphoria.\n\nYou do have to discipline your child because you love them and want them to learn what is socially acceptable and what is right, so it is okay to deny his gift when he is acting this way, but I think once you do give him his gift, you both should sit him down and have a talk with him about what you will not tolerate and make it clear that when he behaves this way, he will have his electronics taken away because this is unacceptable.\n\nAlso, his friend is a little asshole who gets whatever the fuck he wants and his parents enable it. You have the absolute right to refuse that your child hangs out with this kid. He is such a bad influence on your child, I don\u2019t see how you haven\u2019t already thought about doing this.\n\nNTA.

His parents are going to turn Peter into a bad influence later on.", "NTA Christmas gifts are a privilege not a right. The proof that you were right is seeing the vast improvement in your son's behaviour. I agree with previous posts that a talk with your son about why it is important to be grateful and respectful etc would reinforce what he has learned here. And if he continues to behave, give him his Christmas gift and tell him that he has earned it back.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe a tiny bit too harsh, but ultimately it seems that the punishment had the exact desired effect. You can now turn the present into a reward for something, teach him that nice things can be earned.", "NTA. If you give him the gift, you are basically telling him it\u2019s okay to break stuff and throw a tantrum as long, as you say sorry afterwards. You can hold on to it and continue to watch his behavior. If he stops mimicking Peter\u2019s poor behavior, then you can always give it to him later.", "YTA for being a bully to your child. if you want him to learn to control his emotions you do that without punishing him for having those emotions in the first place. You can't punish your way to good behaviour, the only thing that will lead to is sneaky, manipulative children who learn  to game you for treats.", "While I understand you're worried about Peter's bad influence... C'mon dude, it's Christmas. Give him the present.

Or better yet, backs the partner up.\n\nThink of it this way.  Hubby is on a business trip in Europe.  Kid is way out of line and needs to be disciplined now.  It is something that can't wait for tomorrow.  You can't reach hubby because of the time difference.  Do you postpone discipline for a few days until hubby gets home?  Of course not.   \n\nSo even if hubby is in the same room with you at the time, you are free to discipline your child as you see fit.  With or without discussing it with hubby first.  The time to figure out if you two were on the same page was BEFORE you got pregnant.  So there should be little to discuss now, as far as parenting goes...\n\nTo be clear, you aren't wrong in consulting your partner.

One of the worst beatings I ever got in my life.  It was when my mother returned home from work and discovered that while I'd remembered to FEED THE DOG, I forgot to close the lid on the dog food container.  My monster bio mom was so upset about that open container of dog food that she grabbed me by the hair and bounced my skull off of all the closed doors in our hallway.  I blacked out at some point.  But as I got older, bigger and \\*athletic\\* it wasn't as easy for her to beat me up anymore.  I could defend myself.  I was generally a A/B student with more A's than B's.  Not quite straight A, but did very well in school.  Until 10th grade when I got a C in Science.  Never mind that all my other grades were A, and I'd just (the week before) took first prize in a multi-state Math competition.  C was unacceptable.  When I got home the next day, my room was empty other than my bed, bedding and a couple of changes of clothes.  \n\nIt wasn't long afterward that I called up my father and informed him (I wasn't asking) that I would be living with him on the other side of town.  He objected at first, until I calmly explained to him that the other alternative is that somebody was going to die.  I wasn't making an empty threat.  But I wasn't sure who would die, either.

It tears me apart to know that other children also deal with this, and it\u2019s absolutely devastating.\n\nI\u2019m honestly breaking down right now because thinking of my own memories is just heartbreaking.\n\nI grew up being told that physical punishment was normal and that I would get my ass beaten if I didn\u2019t do what I was told which made me more and more defiant.

(\"These are the rules of the house: use kind words and actions, follow directions the first time they are given, if you make a mistake or break something then you must make it right.\" Or whatever the rules you want to have would be, this is just an example.)\n\n2: When Carl does a behavior you do not want him to do, tell him not to do that in clear language. (\"Carl, I already said 'no' to opening presents. This discussion is over, we're not talking about it anymore. You can open your presents on Christmas.\")\n\n3: If the behavior persists (and is not violent or escalating), state a consequence that is directly related to whatever the behavior is. (\"I already said no. If you bring this up again, then you will have to wait an extra day to open up your presents.\") Being directly related is important, because it shows that the consequence is because of the action they choose, not just a random punishment.\n\n4: If the behavior continues or escalates, carry out the consequence.\n\n5: After Carl calms down, have a discussion about what happened. Be empathetic and express that you understand his feelings, but don't remove the consequence.\n\nIf at any time violence is an issue (like how he started throwing things), immediately remove either Carl or everyone else from the situation. Items can be broken, but you don't want people to get hurt. Once Carl calms down, make him fix what was damaged (cleaning up the area, throwing away broken things, making him use his allowance to pay for items he broke, etc.) and have a discussion with him about it. Again, make him responsible for his actions, but have empathy and explain that we all get angry sometimes, but that there are better ways to express anger and that you will help him find safer ways to express his anger.\n\nIf this all sounds a bit formulaic, it's how we're trained to work with emotional students in my school district.

Their behaviour was unchecked by the parents. Needless to say, he made friends within the group, but the ones who were behaving in a self-centred and instant gratification type way weren't welcome in personal friendships. It was a real disservice for the parents to allow their children to behave that way as they hadn't learnt normal social expectations of give & take, or personal boundaries of others.
