English isn't my first language, sorry for any mistakes.\n\nI (39m) have a son Carl(9m) with my wife (35f). Carl is usually a good kid, does well in school, does all of his homework, helps around the house and is all around well behaved. His best friend Peter (10m) is spoiled. He gets whatever he wants anytime, breaks School rules, does what he wants to his parents and other kids  and throws tantrums whenever something is not like he wants it to be. I have met Peters parents in School and at birthday parties. They are nice people but whenever Peter doesn't get his way, they start trying to calm him down and try getting him whatever he wants so that he would calm down. \n\nSo at the issue at hand. For the last couple of months Carl's behaviour has been changing. He became more bratty, started arguing with us. We have talked it through with my wife about his behaviour and came to the conclusion that maybe he is starting to go through puberty earlier than usually. \n\nBut later he started complaining, that we are not that great compared to Peters parents. In his words peters parents got him everything he wanted, he didn't have to go to bed on time, he doesn't have to help around etc. Well it did tic me off a little, but I dismissed it.\n\nSo 4 days ago Carl came to me and said he wants to get his Christmas gift early, because Peter already got his. I said no because we were having a family get together and we would open presents as a family on that day. Well that didn't sit right with Carl cause he started throwing a fit and saying that he hated us and that Peters parents were so much better. I was getting angry but holding myself together. But then he started breaking stuff and went full brat. At that moment I was angry and got a hold of his hands so that he would stop and said that now he won't be getting his present from us. This made him cry because he knew we got him a Nintendo Switch. He ran into his room and stayed there the whole day only coming down to eat dinner where he didn't speak to us. My wife said I was a little too harsh on him, but I stayed firm that I was right. He did apologize later and I said he still won't be getting his Christmas present. He was sad but accepting of it. Now after seeing him apologize and not get angry when I denied him getting his present this year, I feel like maybe I was a little to harsh on him and should give him his present. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Reading all of your comments and taking notes of what I should do.

I would be looking at options to separate the boys. This friendship will not serve your son well as they head into the more vulnerable teenage years where peers are more important than parents. My son had a very close friendship with a kid who was getting progressively out of control and seeing the adults in his world responses was alarming. I happened to be studying drug & alcohol and psychology etc at the time, and there were varied things that were confronting me as a parent about the future for the boys seeing the dynamic of their relationship and surrounding adults. Anyway, I took my son out of that school and the relationship ended. We ran into him years later... He'd been in juvenile detention, drug rehab and was no longer at school. It was really sad to see this 15 yr old but the writing was on the wall and no one was interested in what I had to say. Parents were very wealthy and executives so had it under control.", "NTA.

While recognizing it may be difficult for him to understand or accept now, explain to him why you are making certain decisions.    This is a lot to process for a 9 year old child - of course he wants the instant gratification and your role is to talk him through the bigger picture. Sometimes this will be coupled with \u201cpunishment\u201d which I call \u201cconsequences\u201d for certain actions or behaviours in our house.   \n\nPs give him the switch.

Folks like Peter who don't get told \"No\" or aren't held accountable for their actions and disciplined in a proper manner won't change when they're older, unless they get slapped with a harsh reality slap.\n\nPeter's parents need to get a hold of their situation and remember they're in control, if they want what's best for Peter, giving into such bratty actions is only going to make things worse for his future.\n\nThough at some point perhaps Carl should get something for Christmas if not the Switch. Something to say he still got a small gift or two. As others have said, maybe gift Carl the original gift a bit later on, when he's shown he's recently done more good.", "NTA this is how parenting is.

He needs to have it laid out for him exactly why he is facing these consequences.  He needs to be able to identify, in his own words, what he did wrong.\n\nYou are making sure Carl understands that spoiled brat behavior is unacceptable.  You are reacting in the exact opposite way to a temper tantrum than Peter's parents would, which is good.  Kids test boundaries -- Carl sees Peter getting whatever he wants through demands and tantrums.  Carl wants to see if the same tactics would work for him.

That sends mixed signals, and makes him think he can behave however he likes, as long as he apologizes later.  Get him something else for Christmas.", "It is too harsh. Withholding christmas gifts is really mean, especially that he  apologised. Instead of punishing him that cruelly and destroying his joy of Christmas, you should have a talk with him. ( you may also punish him in other way)Explain that your family does things differently that his friend's family and it would be inappropriate to give him his present earlier, as the whole point of Christmas is to give presents to everybody at the same time. Also that you are sorry that he thinks his friend's family is better as you try really hard to take care of his needs. Let him tell you what he thinks is better in the other family. If he refers to material things, tell him, that although he may think now otherwise, money is not the most important thing. If he complains about lack of attention to him- try to give him more of that. Cruel punishment will only make him overtly obey you, but secretly hate you. Unless, that's  what you want\n\nYTA.", "NTA. Too many kids are growing up entitled and throw a fit when they don\u2019t get their own way. You are not overly harsh.

Put the agreement on  the fridge door so he sees it everyday. By sign i man just let him write his name. And if he does have another similar tantrum dont hesitate to take it with no return.\n\nThen play for an hour with him for the first game as a bonding exercise.\n\nThen honestly you and your wife figure out how to separate these two boys - as he is not a good influence", "Punishing him was appropriate, but taking away his Christmas present entirely wasn't something you should have done without talking to your wife, and sounds like too much, unless you've left out a lot of information. YTA.", "Well, I mean, he was throwing a tantrum because he has a shitty friend who is influencing his behavior. He\u2019s only 9. He is not going to fully grasp the concept of how upsetting his behavior is because he is still a child, but that does *not* excuse him from acting this way.\n\nNow, to be fair, I do think that you would not be doing the right thing by refusing to give him his gift on Christmas Day because I believe the most fulfilling thing in a parent\u2019s life (well, in my own life for sure) is seeing their eyes light up and their happiness when they get to open their gifts. I don\u2019t know how else to describe that feeling, but for me it\u2019s euphoria.\n\nYou do have to discipline your child because you love them and want them to learn what is socially acceptable and what is right, so it is okay to deny his gift when he is acting this way, but I think once you do give him his gift, you both should sit him down and have a talk with him about what you will not tolerate and make it clear that when he behaves this way, he will have his electronics taken away because this is unacceptable.\n\nAlso, his friend is a little asshole who gets whatever the fuck he wants and his parents enable it. You have the absolute right to refuse that your child hangs out with this kid. He is such a bad influence on your child, I don\u2019t see how you haven\u2019t already thought about doing this.\n\nNTA. Discipline is necessary, but I hope you\u2019ll take my suggestions into consideration. I think it would bring so much happiness to both you and your child if you could truly see him enjoy his gift.", "NTA. Do NOT give him his present. Also try to get him away from Peter please. His parents are going to turn Peter into a bad influence later on.", "NTA Christmas gifts are a privilege not a right. The proof that you were right is seeing the vast improvement in your son's behaviour. I agree with previous posts that a talk with your son about why it is important to be grateful and respectful etc would reinforce what he has learned here. And if he continues to behave, give him his Christmas gift and tell him that he has earned it back.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe a tiny bit too harsh, but ultimately it seems that the punishment had the exact desired effect. You can now turn the present into a reward for something, teach him that nice things can be earned.", "NTA. If you give him the gift, you are basically telling him it\u2019s okay to break stuff and throw a tantrum as long, as you say sorry afterwards. You can hold on to it and continue to watch his behavior. If he stops mimicking Peter\u2019s poor behavior, then you can always give it to him later.", "YTA for being a bully to your child. if you want him to learn to control his emotions you do that without punishing him for having those emotions in the first place. You can't punish your way to good behaviour, the only thing that will lead to is sneaky, manipulative children who learn  to game you for treats.", "While I understand you're worried about Peter's bad influence... C'mon dude, it's Christmas. Give him the present. I think your son understood the message, \"actions have consequences.\"\n\nYTA\n\nBesides, there are better way to punish him for his behaviour: snow shoveling, taking out the garbage, more chores around the house, grounding him.\n\nAnd, more important, sit your son down and explain him that no, Peter's parents aren\u2019t great, and are doing their son a disservice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They'll lose a privilege same way they would any other time of the year- tends to make things more consistent. \n\nThis behaviour has been brewing for a while from what you've written and you initially 'dismissed it'. Lesson learned, address this shit earlier on in future. Don't wait for things to go nuclear.", "NTA. Tell him you are going to return the Switch and use the money to replace the things he broke. Actions have consequences and when he feels those consequences, he may just change his actions.", "A permanent punishment like taking away the Christmas gift forever, is overkill, especially at that age. So yeah unfortunately YTA as you went in way too heavy.

Discipline is one thing, consequences is another, and punishment is neither.

My son had a friend whose mother would baby him. They were in 3rd or 4th grade.

Mom made it and brought it up to him. Later my son said that he told his friend that I would have never done that. LOL. Because I would have wanted him to be polite, ask if it was ok, and maybe make it himself.  Totally different style of parenting but I think mine has helped my son be more self-sufficient.

I was so fed up with it. He was causing my kids to be defiant. I was so thankful once it ended because my kids started being better behaved once again after this.\n\nAnd I also agree- Christmas is the perfect time of year to also give the gift of mercy and forgiveness.

At that age events like Christmas are emotionally important.", "Well, I kind of agree.  For most things, I would discuss them with my partner.  But if kiddo needs discipline, I am perfectly capable of handling that alone...and so is she.  What's most important is that if one parent acts, the other (at the very least) STAYS OUT OF THE WAY.  Or better yet, backs the partner up.\n\nThink of it this way.  Hubby is on a business trip in Europe.  Kid is way out of line and needs to be disciplined now.  It is something that can't wait for tomorrow.  You can't reach hubby because of the time difference.  Do you postpone discipline for a few days until hubby gets home?  Of course not.   \n\nSo even if hubby is in the same room with you at the time, you are free to discipline your child as you see fit.  With or without discussing it with hubby first.  The time to figure out if you two were on the same page was BEFORE you got pregnant.  So there should be little to discuss now, as far as parenting goes...\n\nTo be clear, you aren't wrong in consulting your partner.  But you shouldn't feel wrong to make your own decision independently, either.", ">Denying a 9yo child a Christmas oresent is a big thing.\n\nI have distant relatives living in areas where Christmas means they might get some special food to eat for one meal that day.

Denying a 9yo child a Christmas present is only a big thing if his parents are 110% determined to raise an entitled AH.", "That brings back bad memories.  Not that I think you are wrong.  But my mother was a real AH.  I'm sure you would have even hated her.  She would physically beat the crap out of me for any minor infraction.  Example.  One of the worst beatings I ever got in my life.  It was when my mother returned home from work and discovered that while I'd remembered to FEED THE DOG, I forgot to close the lid on the dog food container.  My monster bio mom was so upset about that open container of dog food that she grabbed me by the hair and bounced my skull off of all the closed doors in our hallway.  I blacked out at some point.  But as I got older, bigger and \\*athletic\\* it wasn't as easy for her to beat me up anymore.  I could defend myself.  I was generally a A/B student with more A's than B's.  Not quite straight A, but did very well in school.  Until 10th grade when I got a C in Science.  Never mind that all my other grades were A, and I'd just (the week before) took first prize in a multi-state Math competition.  C was unacceptable.  When I got home the next day, my room was empty other than my bed, bedding and a couple of changes of clothes.  \n\nIt wasn't long afterward that I called up my father and informed him (I wasn't asking) that I would be living with him on the other side of town.  He objected at first, until I calmly explained to him that the other alternative is that somebody was going to die.  I wasn't making an empty threat.  But I wasn't sure who would die, either.  I just knew that somebody was in severe danger as long as my mom and I were under the same roof.", ">So the kid will remember it like his worst Christmas ever and resent his father.\n\nIf that's honestly the way the kid parses the lesson in his little pea brain, then it's obvious that the parents have more work to do!!!\n\nResenting father for not giving him a cherished Christmas present because he was acting like a spoiled brat is...\n\nSPOILED BRAT BEHAVIOR", "Learning not to be TA is even more emotionally important", "Circumstances change things of course. Hence why I said \"almost\".", "I am so sincerely sorry that you went through this and this really saddens me to hear. No one deserves to be treated this way. Our children are precious gifts, and any parent that treats their children this way is absolute garbage. I had a violent stepfather who beat me and my sister when we made him angry. It tears me apart to know that other children also deal with this, and it\u2019s absolutely devastating.\n\nI\u2019m honestly breaking down right now because thinking of my own memories is just heartbreaking.\n\nI grew up being told that physical punishment was normal and that I would get my ass beaten if I didn\u2019t do what I was told which made me more and more defiant. I tell my kids often that I am proud of them and it gives me so much happiness to provide them with the life that I never had as a kid. I always strive to give them a great childhood because mine was robbed from me and I don\u2019t have very many positive memories of my life growing up.", "Op's kid is generally well behaved, and when his dad said he wouldn't have the gift, the child didn't threw another tantrum. I think he understood and I stand my ground - I really don't care about the downvoting  - this is overkill.", ">I grew up being told that physical punishment was normal and that I would get my ass beaten if I didn\u2019t do what I was told which made me more and more defiant. \n\nWell, as I got older and understood it wasn't me...\n\nI learned that children subjected to violence like that tend to fall into two categories:\n\n1)  They grow up to be abusive parents, repeating the cycle of violence  OR\n\n2)  They tend to be pretty damn good parents, as they learned what NOT to do by observing how their own parents behaved.\n\nI've raised three kids myself, off and on.  I've only had to spank one of them.  And I only had to do that ONCE.  After that, if I even give him a certain look he will realize he's out of line and straighten up quick.  The other two have given me no trouble at all, including my step-son.  From the first moment I met him, he was always very respectful.  I've only had to TALK with him a few times.  Because the kid listens.  \n\nI could never be violent with a child like my bio mom was.  It would be very painful for ME."]}
