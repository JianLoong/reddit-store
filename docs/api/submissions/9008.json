We both work as managers for the same compay and our other roommate Carlton (M39) also works there as well. My roommate Carlton agrees that my other roommate Craig should not sleep in the living room every night. \n\nHe treats it like his own room.

Over 2500sqf so the house is not small. Carlton and I can never host any party\u2019s or have friends over because he always sleeps in the living room. We\u2019ve asked why he won\u2019t sleep in his room and he feels like sleeping on the couch is perfectly acceptable. We all have our own rooms and split rent and utilities equal so I feel like he should sleep in his room.\n\nWe\u2019ve offered to do what we can to make his room more comfortable, but he declines. I\u2019m a very social person and rent isn\u2019t cheap where I live. I just want to be able to invite guests and family to my house and we all be able to relax in my living room without a 28 year old man sleeping in it and snoring.

Maybe he has something going on that he needs to be out there to be comfortable. But it still isn't fair. Like it would be different if he came out of his room late at night to sleep out there.

I had a roommate once who did this and it absolutely DESTROYED my couch.  Beds have sheets that are easily cleaned - a couch doesn't.  It's the equivalent of sleeping directly on a mattress (except even worse, because others probably sit there during the day!). Don't feel guilty about insisting that stops immediately.", "Nope just charge rent for both  living room and his bedroom until he only uses his bedroom  to sleep.
