I can picture it exactly because I once had an alcoholic roommate who did this and I legit had to throw the entire thing out when he left because of how badly it was damaged. Instead of focusing on the living room, keep it on the fact that you cannot allow him to damage your property by using it differently than intended. That's something he can't really argue against. It is indeed necessary to treat shared objects someone else owns in the manner the owner prefers. It's your couch and you only want people to use it for couch things during daytime hours. That is very reasonable. I like other suggestions to move the couch to your room in the meantime.\n\nFrom there you can address his dominating the living room later. Solve this issue first and then move to that second issue.

If you have friends over and he's asleep on the couch, you could have them just sit down anyway, carry on the party, etc. If sleeping out there is no longer more comfortable than his room, maybe the problem solves itself.

I am, however very aware that they absolutely hated that one was constantly sleeping on the couch (when he slept at all). He never left the living room and they just found t exhausting after a while because he also would rarely turn off CNN. So it was just a constant loop of the same news stories over and over again unless all could agree on watching some movie together. I see how that would get frustrating especially if he treats YOUR couch like it's his room with bottles and stinky shoes thrown about.", "NTA but stop changing your plans around him. Have your people over, watch your shows, play your games, listen to your music, and sit on your couch (and him) in the process if he doesn't take the hint.

My father wouldn\u2019t sleep in a bed and would give the same excuses. He said the bed was uncomfortable so we got a new bed for him.    He never even tried it.  So we got a sofa bed for him that he could use at night in the living room.  Never even tried it.  This was really important because he was elderly and diabetic and he needed to lay out because his feet were getting so swollen with oedema and his skin was breaking.  So we then got a recliner chair so he could lay with feet raised at night.  Would not do it.  My father was a contrarian in the extreme.  We would ask why he wouldn\u2019t use a bed but he would get angry and we never did find out, but I think it was just to piss us off for raising the subject.
