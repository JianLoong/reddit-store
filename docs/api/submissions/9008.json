I can picture it exactly because I once had an alcoholic roommate who did this and I legit had to throw the entire thing out when he left because of how badly it was damaged. Instead of focusing on the living room, keep it on the fact that you cannot allow him to damage your property by using it differently than intended. That's something he can't really argue against. It is indeed necessary to treat shared objects someone else owns in the manner the owner prefers. It's your couch and you only want people to use it for couch things during daytime hours. That is very reasonable. I like other suggestions to move the couch to your room in the meantime.\n\nFrom there you can address his dominating the living room later. Solve this issue first and then move to that second issue.

If you have friends over and he's asleep on the couch, you could have them just sit down anyway, carry on the party, etc. If sleeping out there is no longer more comfortable than his room, maybe the problem solves itself.

I am, however very aware that they absolutely hated that one was constantly sleeping on the couch (when he slept at all). He never left the living room and they just found t exhausting after a while because he also would rarely turn off CNN. So it was just a constant loop of the same news stories over and over again unless all could agree on watching some movie together. I see how that would get frustrating especially if he treats YOUR couch like it's his room with bottles and stinky shoes thrown about.", "NTA but stop changing your plans around him. Have your people over, watch your shows, play your games, listen to your music, and sit on your couch (and him) in the process if he doesn't take the hint.

My father wouldn\u2019t sleep in a bed and would give the same excuses. He said the bed was uncomfortable so we got a new bed for him.    He never even tried it.  So we got a sofa bed for him that he could use at night in the living room.  Never even tried it.  This was really important because he was elderly and diabetic and he needed to lay out because his feet were getting so swollen with oedema and his skin was breaking.  So we then got a recliner chair so he could lay with feet raised at night.  Would not do it.  My father was a contrarian in the extreme.  We would ask why he wouldn\u2019t use a bed but he would get angry and we never did find out, but I think it was just to piss us off for raising the subject.

Fill it up again and repeat.", "mmm, a 3 am smoothie does sound pretty good....", "I think it's more the fact that on top of regular couch use, there's also anywhere from 6-10 hours (assuming regular sleep schedules) of his full body weight pressing down on the springs every single day.", "And loads of sweat and god knows what else. He is definitely gonna ruin that couch a lot faster than if it was used normally.", "NTA, if I had to deal with a roommate like that, I would purposely start throwing parties and having friends/family over constantly, and I sure as hell wouldn't be quiet either.\n\nThe dude wants to sleep in a common space shared by everyone in the house, then he can deal with the normal noise and people around him or he can drag his ass back to his room.\n\nI would also start taking any stuff he leaves in the living room, and just start tossing that stuff in his room. Maybe he will start getting the point/idea after he can no longer \"sleep\" in the SHARED LIVING ROOM!", "Start having people over every night sitting on his couch bed until he's forced to move into his room. NTA", "NTA, but really, you're being too accommodating. Just use this space and make it uncomfortable for him.", "NTA, definitely a place to stand your ground. it's a common area, not another bedroom. just start bringing people over and shout over his snoring, put chairs right in front of the couch and talk loudly about how inconvenient is you can't use your own couch, put the TV on loud, it isn't his place to act like this. dude thinks he's archie bunker or something. airhorns. blenders. rocks under the cushions. bright white LED lights. literally all of that is more acceptable than sleeping in the living room after you've been asked not to. if he's not going to share that consideration then i'd start getting real rude with it.", "Sell him the couch and move it into his room", "NTA just sit on him if he\u2019s asleep on your couch, it\u2019s your couch not his bed.", "NTA you and the other roommate need to reclaim that common area.  It's completely unfair that he's taken that over.\n\nBack in college, I had a roommate who rearranged our dorm room while I was out for a few hours, and it basically made it all her space, and I basically had my bed in one corner, and then later another who was ALWAYS home.  Always.  I live alone now and LOVE IT.", "NTA. Toss all his stuff into his room, clean the living room. Invite people over a few hours before he goes to bed, and keep the party going. He can stay up or go to his bed, but the couch is in use.", "NTA\n\nNot only is he going to ruin your couch, as others have mentioned, he's keeping you from using the living room.  I would tell him that since he's keeping you and your other roommate from using the living room, his rent will have to go up. Perhaps this will convince him to sleep in his bedroom.", "NTA. But please say \"no, thats my couch and you cant sleep on it anymore. And if you cant sleep in your own room, we are going to have to either move out or get the landlord to evict you.", "Why is this even a discussion?  You and your other roommate need to issue an ultimatum:  Either Craig uses his own room as intended, leaving the shared spaces for their intended purposes, or he will be evicted. No argument.  No discussion.  Then follow through, if necessary.  One person doesn\u2019t get to dictate the rules around shared space.  NTA, but you will be if you and the other roomie don\u2019t grow spines.", "NTA. Sell the couch or move it to another room. Sometimes you just have to be petty.", "NTA\n\nTell him he's out at the end of the lease if he can't sleep in his room", "He's being a major dick. Ask him to move out. NTA.", "NTA. Move the couch into his bedroom and get a different couch.", "NTA\n\n Yeah no he needs to go back in his room.", "NTA, if that's your couch, sell it and buy an uncomfortable one.", "NTA, you have the same right to the living room space as he has. As a compromise you can make a sharing schedule. Days he can use the living room and days when you two will be using it... He can't demand all that space for himself. It is not his only.. besides Living with someone who has drinking habits...not pleasant.\nIf he won't compromise, I would sell the sofa.. seriously....(the hell I would never tolerate a drunkard to be sleeping on my own sofa, while I can't even use it?!)", "NTA. He sounds like a very inconsiderate roommate. Is he on the lease, when does the lease expire?", "NTA.  Ask Craig if he is willing to pay half the rent, since he has effectively claimed half the living space in the house.  Seriously, he doesn't have squatters rights to the living room.  He's definitely an asshole for doing this.", "NTA\n\nTurn his bedroom into a living room.", "NTA", "NTA. It's a common area and should be treated as such.", "Exactly.  That's common area, start using it.", "I was in an eerily similar situation when I was younger and this is exactly what we did.", "Good idea.", "\\*He\\* should move if anything.  You and Carlton are doing fine it seems.\n\nIf this is your couch, consider it a loss at this point.  There is so much sweat, semen, and assjuice you don't want it back.\n\nIn the meantime though, buy a cover and invite people over constantly so it's always occupied.  Live your life and if he happens to be sleeping there, wake him up with your guests behind you and ask him to finish his nap in his room since 5 people need a place to sit in the communal living room.\n\nClose friends don't treat other friends like doormats.  You may think of him as your close friend but his treatment of you shows he does not feel the same.", "Tell him this but phrase it as \u2018when the lease ends we won\u2018t be able to continue living together\u2019 because really he should move out.", "Can you squirt him with a water pistol when he won\u2019t get off the sofa? Works for my dog.", "Have you seen his room? I actually had to evict someone for this same reason, she would never be in her room. My living room was her bedroom, work space, and our other roommates bathroom she also tried to take over. \n\nWhen I finally figured out what was going on, it turned out she was a MASSIVE hoarder and literally couldnt get INTO her room. Im still trying to figure out how she hid the smell from us SO well. \n\nYoure never T A when someone is literally taking advantage of you(friend or not) and youre just trying to reclaim your living space.", "Bagpipes!", "And a vuvuzela to announce your presence every time he starts snoring.", "Yessssssss", "I actually do get up at 3am on Mondays, otherwise 5am for work. He would not sleep lol", "I grew up with a parent who slept on a couch and yeah...I had no idea couches were nice or comfortable until I got one as an adult and it...lasted.", "There's a dent in my friend's couch from when he slept on it for a while due to snoring.", "NTA. I have an uncle that does this, in his case it\u2019s a combination of stubbornly untreated depression and barely-functioning alcoholism. Sounds like your roommate might be leaning the same way.\n\nI\u2019d suggest he gets professional help, but that\u2019s on him, not you. \n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019d definitely go with the suggestions to just have parties/gathering in the living room as often as you can until he gets the hint", "NTA. Living room is a common area. Not a sleeping area.", "NTA you need to stop asking and start telling. Just straight up make it a household rule, nobody sleeps on the couch or stores personal items in the living room. Every time you see his stuff go put it in his room or stack it outside the door. Every time you see him on the couch bang pots together until he gets his ass up and goes to bed. Quit being nice about it.", "You and your roommate should absolutely have a blow out party and make sure it lasts until the wee hours of the morning to make sure he isn't sleeping on the couch.  Make it a regular even until he gets the mesage", "NTA. I would recommend scheduling a meeting with all roommates during which you and the other good roommate address this problem with the bad roommate and let them know what they're doing is unacceptable and won't be tolerated any longer. Let them no if they can't or won't stop treating the living room as their own little man cave then they will be evicted.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s being rude. Falling asleep on the couch from time to time is no biggie but he\u2019s basically taken over an additional room while still only paying for one", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10svphv/aita_for_sleeping_on_the_couch/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nIs this your roommate OP\ud83e\udee3", "NTA.  That is communal space.  If he is going to use it that much of the time, his rent goes up.", "NTA I'd tell him this is a common area, it stinks, its your couch, and that he either needs to buy his own couch or stop sleeping on yours. Also, I recommend inviting guests over regardless of if he's in the living room because, as I said, its a common area. He has a place to go if he doesn't want to be disturbed. \n\nSo confused as to why this nearly 40 year old man is acting like a 14 year old.", "NTA. His behavior is gross and not acceptable.", "NTA it sounds like he owes you a new couch because he\u2019s gonna wear it down much faster than if y\u2019all were using it, plus the sweat from him sleeping. I\u2019d take the couch elsewhere and get chairs instead. As someone without a couch, it\u2019s actually not a bad thing. Arm chairs are quite comfy for everything but sleeping. He may prefer the couch but until he lives alone he doesn\u2019t get to pick that option. It\u2019s interfering with you living a normal life and he\u2019s not paying extra rent for the extra room. Maybe take over his room and use it as a living room and when he complains tell him he has to pick.", "NTA kick him out.", "NTA & wow y\u2019all commenters are on a roll with all of those perfectly petty suggestions. Bravo internet!", "The problem is that you & Carlton are ALSO treating the living room as Craig's room. Stop doing that! Go in there & turn the TV on, loudly. Make stinky food & take it there to eat it. Shove his feet off the couch & sit down. Make sure you always turn on the lights. Take phone calls in there. Invite friends over and hang out in there. You don't need permission: it's YOUR LIVING ROOM. If Craig doesn't like it, well, he can go to HIS room - he does have one.", "NTA. Had a similar situation with a roommate. Tossing his stuff into his room a few times and having his mother come around seemed to do the trick.\n\nThat and moving out. Best day ever.", "NTA. Who even does that? Kick him out.", "That sounds a bit of a pain for OP. Just hide a smart speaker in the room and programme it to blare out loud music at intervals throughout the night. No need for her or the good housemate to have their sleep disturbed.", "Heck, put it in a storage unit or ask a friend if you can store it at their house for a while. It\u2019s yours. He doesn\u2019t get to sleep on it every night when he\u2019s got a perfectly good bed of his own.", "Also, tell him that since he is currently occupying TWO rooms, his share of the rent would have to go up. Retroactively.", "Rearrange the living room so that the sectional is split up into lots of little sections, none of which are big enough to sleep on. Move one or two sections elsewhere if necessary. \n\nI get that he\u2019s your friend, but he isn\u2019t treating you like you\u2019re his friend. A true friend doesn\u2019t take advantage of you like this.", "Bagpipes: best played loud.", "Others not only sit there, but partake in biological warfare by passing gas on it.", "Nah, tell him you're going to throw the couch out. If he wants it he can buy it and put it in his room but it's not staying in the living room.\n\nI'm wondering if he'd try arguing the price down because of the wear and tear *he caused*. Whole thing reminds me of that nasty American Dad episode \"this couch is my bedroom, bathroom and my *lover*.\" Blegh.", "We all know Craig ain't putting sheets on that couch.", "Maybe there's someone out there who would be willing to pay more for the, um, extras? :)", "We had a guest who started sleeping on the couch for some reason although they had a bed & they completely killed my couch.  \n\n\nThey would stretch & push against the armrest by their feet, which broke the armrest & then the rest of the couch went quickly. I was fine with them living here, I was not fine with having to buy a new couch, because they are stupid expensive & in the meantime, my livingroom looked like a frat house."]}
