She agreed to invite me cause she thought I wouldn't like him. Also she didn't find him attractive enough for me, her words exactly.\n\n\r  \nThen I told her that I would go out with him and she was so frustrated and kept telling me not to and after a while she backed out of that and just said (as a compromise I guess) to atleast not kiss him. After the first two dates, she asked me to not see him again and that he isnt good for me.After that day, she yeld at him and then stopped speaking to me.\n\n\r  \nThe few times we talked she told me to go be with that asshole since I prefer him and good luck. I thought that she would realize its not her decision to make and should support me no matter what and eventually if the guy turned out to be shitty, she would just be there for me.\n\n\r  \nNine months later I'm still with him and she only texted me one time when me and him went on a mini vacation and he posted a photo of me on his ig story. She texted me this \"tell your asshole of a boyfriend to atleast have the courtesy not to post you online because people from work follow him and they know we are best friends and you are ridiculing me and I wont stand for it\".\r  \nAnd I started sobbing and woke him up and he was just there telling me to relax and asking what happened and then I told him about the text but not the context.\n\n\r  \nAnyways he saw the text by accident a few days later and told me that he felt bad about how much this was affecting me. I then asked him if he minded that I didnt respond.And he didn\u2019t. I then told him that I dont want to respond because I know that she\u2019ll reply with even more bitterness and I'll just feel bad again and he got that and told me to do whatever I wanted.\n\n\r  \nFor a few months he asked here and there if we talked or anything but we hadnt and I dont think we will at this point. Yes, I could make an effort to rekindle our friendship but I dont want to, I didnt deserve to be treated the way she treated me and talked to the way she did. I never talked bad to her, never disregarded her opinions, never did anything majorly wrong. Of course I would have done some bad things, nobodys perfect but still.\n\n\r  \nI feel so calm with him. I can say anything I feel even when I dont find the right words he tells me it's fine and waits to hear everything I have to say. I always thought the thing I wanted in a relationship is to be able to talk, not to be afraid to share my thoughts and emotions.And this is exactly the relationship I have. And I am so happy that this is my first experience.\n\n\r  \nAITA for basically ignoring my bff and making my own decisions? \r  \nPS. She was in a long term relationship and always told me about how serious she wants to be with him.
