Her parents share custody and she spends weekends with us, has her room in our house, visits whenever she wants to and I absolutely love her. I have a two year old daughter with my husband so my stepdaughter visits us a lot in the week to see her as well, so we spend lots of time together basically. She's a really good kid and we get along really well.

I accept that that's her mother and it's her decision the rules she makes for her daughter. Last week it was her birthday and she spent the weekend after it with us. On the Sunday, I had an appointment at the salon to get my hair colour maintenance and I was getting my nails done after. I was expecting my stepdaughter to be doing something with her friends that afternoon but they cancelled their plans with her so she was going to be home alone. I was going to cancel my appointment but she begged me to let her come to the salon with me instead, and I felt guilty saying no so I said yes. I told her that she could maybe get a pedicure or something but nothing major but I have absolutely zero resolve and I caved and let her get her hair cut and styled, and a really minor mani/pedi (not acrylics or anything, just a simple file and polish). I'm telling myself it's because it was her birthday weekend but I know I have a problem saying no to her. She's such a good kid, always gets good grades, super polite and kind and I just felt like she deserved it. I know I'm not her mother and it wasn't my call. \n\nHer mother was absolutely furious when she saw, and it's caused a big riff between her and my husband with her threatening to not let our stepdaughter visit us if I'm going to \"rub off on her with my bad influence\" (I believe she used worse words than that to describe my \"influence\" but it's not important so we move.)\n\nI feel like I'm the asshole because I've created conflict between my husband and his ex when their coparenting relationship is already very fragile, I got my stepdaughter in trouble with her mother and just generally caused a lot of tension because of my inability to say no.

Getting a haircut and her nails done is small, fun and low maintenance. \n\nIt does sound like her mom is starting to have unrealistic expectations and struggling to come to terms with the fact that her little girl isn't so little anymore. \n\nI would recommend perhaps your husband and his ex start trying to find a way to allow her to experiment in a way that gives her autonomy but also maintains healthy self image.", "I'm going with NTA, but one bit of info needed: What's your husband's opinion on this? \n\nRealistically, having hair and nails done at age 15 is about as minimally disruptive as possible, and it's not like anything is permanent or unhealthy, but a parent should be ok with it. Mom's opinion doesn't hold any weight when she's in Dad's custody.", "NTA - she's 15, she's old enough to be able to say how she wants her hair and nails done. You did a nice thing for her and I'm sure she appreciated. Mom needs to calm down", "NTA, the custodial parent at the time agrees. It was a birthday present. And it's not like you're taking her to get a tattoo, it's a haircut that knowing the 15-year-olds of today aren't so radical. And a simple mani-pedi that can be removed with any nail polish remover... NTA, mom should be happy that you appreciate her daughter and give her nice gifts.", "You don't cut someone else's daughter's hair without permission....if the kid is 5! A 15 year old girl has choice. She will be cutting mom out of her life pretty soon if mom thinks she can control all of her choices. I'm glad she has you to bounce thoughts off of while her adults argue.", "NTA it sounds like you care very deeply for your stepdaughter and she feels safe around you! That\u2019s ultimately the most important piece of this story. \n\nGrowing up my mom was anti materialistic and I never got to try makeup or traditionally \u201cgirly\u201d things. Being comfortable in my femininity was a huge struggle in my late teens/early 20s because id been withheld/shamed for being interested in \u201csuperficiality\u201d as a child.\n\nit seems like your stepdaughters mother has an issue with your age and how much her daughter actually likes you. And to be fair, given your closeness in ages it is rather unprecedented. Any sort of positive relationship between the two of you would be an issue she\u2019d find problems with. I hope you and your husband are having some serious conversations about how to manage coparenting moving forward and how her mother might try to get in the middle of your relationships. (Keep everything bio mom has ever said to you well documented/dated just in case).", "NTA it\u2019s hair and nails. You did a cute bonding activity with your SD, you both enjoyed yourself, her dad was fine with it and she\u2019s 15. Sounds like you\u2019re a good step mom and bio mom is a loonie bird", "NTA. We\u2019re not talking about some sort of extreme style on a preschooler. Her mother needs to take some deep breaths because being this controlling over small things can cause long term damage to her relationship with her daughter.", "NTA - her reaction has more to do with her own issues and insecurities than anything else.  It's really sad when parents stop thinking about what's actually good and healthy for the kids and put their own feelings as priority instead.  And if there is a court order (which I hope so in this case), no judge is going to change custody because you took her to the salon and got her a haircut she asked for.  \n\nThere isn't much that can be done with the mother.  She's going to be stuck in her feelings for as long as she allows herself to.  The only suggestion I can make is to make sure she doesn't dictate the rules in your house as well.  It's co-parenting.  Which means her father is allowed as much say in his daughter's life as the mother.  Whether or not both parties can understand and respect that is up to them.  Good luck.", "NTA. I feel like this conflict has much more to do with your husband's ex-wife being uncomfortable with the fact that her daughter seems to adore spending time with his new twenty-something year old wife than it does with hair and nails. This is sort of to be expected, not your fault or hers. You sound like an awesome stepmom and you should continue being a safe person for your step-daughter to talk to and spend time with.", "NTA! This young lady is very much YOUR daughter as well and the mother sounds petty and jealous. She should be doing cartwheels and be kissing your feet for being good to her daughter. You didn't create a conflict, the biological mother created one, and just because she's conflicted with her own insecurities, you, your husband and stepdaughter shouldn't be paying for it. If she wants to threaten your husband with keeping her from seeing him, there is something called a lawyer and a courtroom and a judge. *Tell your husband to tell her, see what happens when she tells the judge she's withholding his right as a father to see his daughter, because you took her to the salon for her birthday.*", "Info: what's your husband have to say about the situation?", "NTA - if she was a lot younger, than yes for sure. If you took a 5 yr old to get her hair cut yta, if you took a 5 yr old to get a basic mani or peti, nta. But she is practically a grown ass adult, she should be able to make some of those decisions on her own.", "NTA.\n\nYou did a nice thing to make sure your step daughter had a fun birthday. Nothing harmed her and nothing here is irreversible. The mother needs to get over herself.", "NTA I am a bit suspicious of bio Mom's ideas that wanting to have your hair and nails done is a bit influence. Sounds very much like internalised misogyny (doing something girly = bad) and I think you are probably helping out your stepdaughter by not perpetuating that.", "NTA\n\nI am a stepmom now and was a former stepkid. Your husband is allowed to have different rules for his kids at his household just like mom is allowed to have certain rules at her house. My youngest stepdaughter had a super girly phase. She found a cheap pair of high heels she fell in love with, so I bought them. She wore them constantly at my house and walked better than I do in heels. She told her mom who flipped out on me. The heels only stayed at my house.  I told her that my house will not follow her rules. My SO and I want my bonus kid to build self esteem and have a right to express herself in a safe way. \nFrom the sound of it, her mom is using the daughter as a doll.  She is 15 and deserves to style herself as she sees fit.", " Nta. She's 15, which is more than old enough to her to decide to get hair and make up done. \n\nYour stepdaughter is also old enough that if she requests change in the visitation schedule then the court will (usually) listen to her and change things.", "Soft ESH\n\nBeing a step parent is hard, especially being a good one. I think you see where you may have over stepped. at the very least calling your husband to discuss it with him quickly might have helped. Either he said no, and that was that or he said okay and was ready for any impending drama. I think the lack of consultation with your husband on this is the only reason I would say ESH.\n\nI feel bad for your step daughter. She is 15 after all. she is at an age where she knows what she wants and has the ability to understand consequences of her decisions. She wanted her hair done enough that it outweighed any disapproval from her mother. But, she is also old enough to know how much of a pickle this would put you and her father in. Not a fair position for a child though.\n\nHer mother threatening to prevent her child from seeing her dad is laughable. Your step daughter is at an age where courts would take her decision into account when it comes to living arrangements/timeshare. So her mom really can't pull that crap anymore. I also wonder what are the real reasons she is so against hair stylings and nail filings?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: NTA\n\nI saw in another reply you did in fact talk to your husband.", "NTA. Hair grows back and polish can be removed. Thank you for being so kind to your stepdaughter. She will definitely remember this experience as a positive one.", "NTA: you sound like a lovely stepmom who she trusts and has fun with. You'll be a haven for her in tough times. Good job mama!", "NTA\n\nA 15 year is old enough to make her own decisions about her hair. You didn\u2019t make her have a major transformation and her father was also fine with it. So don\u2019t sweat it too much. The mother would look real stupid in front of a judge for breaking her custody agreement over a haircut and some nail polish.", "NTA. And its a little concerning that getting her hair cut and styled , not even colored or highlighted or anything insane done to it, made her mom this mad. Its really controlling to not let a 15 year old do what they want with their hair or paint their nails", "YTA \u201cI accept that\u2019s her mother and it\u2019s her decision\u201d does it anyways. She is not your daughter and you knowingly went against her actual parents wishes. I\u2019d be furious too because you way overstepped your role. From a completely neutral stand point I agree that the daughter is old enough to make choices like this and think it was a nice thing to do given her bday plans were ruined. But yes you are an AH for taking someone else\u2019s child and doing something you know they aren\u2019t okay with and as a result strained her actual parents co patenting. This isn\u2019t what do we all think is the right thing to do or not, this is am I the AH and based on the situation you are. It is never okay to go against a child\u2019s parents expressed wishes unless those wishes in are harmful to the child. Not wearing makeup or getting your nails done isn\u2019t abuse or harmful, even though I think it\u2019s stupid choice myself it\u2019s not my choice or anyone else\u2019s choice to make because it\u2019s not our child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re being a great parent - and you\u2019ve earned that title!\n\nWhat sort of custody agreement does your husband and his ex have?

Don't beat yourself up, it has nothing to do with you. Your daughter (step feels unnecessary giving the closeness and love you share) feels comfortable with you, her mom is controlling her looks and expression of her style and personality. My mom did that same stuff and now I'm NC with her, but I have a lovely stepmom who is a wonderful friend and confidant and looking forward to being \"GG\" to our first child in May!
