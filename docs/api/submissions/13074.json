It's understandable that you feel disappointed and frustrated that she expects you to spend your bonus money on her and treat her to things, but she is not willing to do the same for you. It's important to communicate your feelings and concerns in a relationship, and pointing out the hypocrisy is a fair way to do so.

If so, that may also factor into her reasoning.", "NTA- unless there is a big pay difference between you.", "NAH. It's frustrating, but she likely genuinely believes due to a long history of gender roles this is how a relationship should function. Is it right? No. But she is by no means alone in this thinking and probably isn't even in the minority even to this day, so it's hard for me to genuinely call her an asshole. You just need to have a conversation and clearly outline that you expect your relationship to be an equal partnership, and if that's not what she is looking for fair to her, but it won't be with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But whenever it started getting lopsided that I was starting to spend more money on the meals or tickets and brought it up, the conversation quickly turned to \"you always talk about money\" or \"I don't want to talk about money\". If the same happened to her, I would make up the difference, but she couldn't be convinced the other way around. I literally could not talk to her about it even if I could pull up receipts to plead the case.
