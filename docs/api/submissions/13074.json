Run.. no, don't look at her, RUN.", "NTA I mean I guess the most straight forward thing to do would be to tell her to transfer money to you the next time she asks for anything and save screen shots of her doing the same thing in case she complains about that so you can show her that your just being fair.  But that doesn\u2019t solve the bigger issue of how you two view helping or doing nice things for each other.   It\u2019s seems her kindness is transactional but expects charity from you.

It helps that we share common ideas about money and how to use it.", "NTA\n\nYou definitely need to discuss this further with her to see if she can tell you why she thinks it's fair to expect gifts from you, but unfair of you to expect the same thing back. If she doesn't have a good answer then you need to take that for what it is; her outright telling you that she expects special treatment in the relationship that she doesn't plan to reciprocate. I agree with everyone else pointing out that's a massive red flag, especially because you don't know where it will stop. Is it just money? Or will it end up being how you spend your free time? The friends you're allowed to have?\n\nWho knows though. She might think there's some other disparity in your relationship that this is making up for, which, it's still not cool that she would just be keeping track of stuff like that without saying anything, but if that's the case it's definitely worth looking in to and discussing, but unacceptable answers are stuff like \"just because,\" \"because it's tradition for guys to treat women and not the other way around,\" or \"it's not the same.\"", "I had stinginess.

My partner doesn't make nearly as much as I do since he's in school, but he does a lot for me in other ways outside of financial stuff. Which I understand, and we've had those conversations. \n\nDoes she do other things for you? And if not, I'd consider another conversation of feeling things are unfair for you, and that you want the same amount of consideration that you give to her. If she takes issue with it, that's where I think you should consider leaving the relationship.\n\nYou deserve to receive the same amount of effort that you give, and if there's a miscommunication, it needs to be resolved. Maybe she thinks she's doing more in other areas, but if not, she isn't seeing you as an equal. Regardless of what she does, you still didn't deserve that when she made more, but didn't want to give back to you. It feels selfish no matter what else she has done for you because it's still a lack of consideration. I hope you come to a solution", "NTA and tbh here it's a really deeply ingrained gender role thing that is difficult to see or be aware of if it's never been pointed out before.

But I guess it comes down to laying out some ground rules early on in the relationship. Me personally, I actually dislike when my girlfriend spends her money on unnecessary things, I would rather she saved it. If she wants something I\u2019ll buy it for her.

While she\u2019s right that you can\u2019t tell her what to do with her money, that door swings both ways. Does she ever pay for dates or is the expectation that you always will? Does she contribute financially to any aspect of your mutual relationship without wanting you to repay her? You need to ask yourself these questions and then decide if this is something that can be changed or whether it\u2019s a dealbreaker. \n\nThe petty ahole in me says that for the next little while, respond in kind. If she asked you to pick something up from the shops, do it as a separate transaction and ask for that money back. If she\u2019s all bent out of shape about you doing to her exactly what she does to you, that should be a pretty strong indicator on how she sees you.", "I honestly think you need not to tell her when you get bonuses. Clearly she\u2019s going to ask for things or expect you to pay for your dinner. And you are resenting she won\u2019t do the same. So keep your bonus to yourself and if you feel like treating her, you can or if you want to just spoil yourself, do so, she showed she won\u2019t reciprocate and it bothers you", "NTA. \nBreak up with her. \nYou and her are not on the same page and unless you are willing to cross over to her way of thinking / acting when it comes to money then you  will end up being miserable and resenting her and then you\u2019d have to break up with her anyway.

It's unfair of her to expect things from you that she's not willing to do in return.", "NTA. It's been said by many, but I definitely believe you two need to discuss this. Financial differences are and can be deal breakers in a relationship. Unless it works for both of you, it's going to cause significant resentment. \n\nYou can also test the waters here a bit more(via the petty route) if you want. Start splitting the bill when out or requesting payment when you bring anything home for her.
