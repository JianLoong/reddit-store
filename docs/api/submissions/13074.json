As soon as I got it my gf was asking what I was going to spend it on and talking asking if I was going to get her a little present with it etc. She mentioned going out for a meal a few times and I thought it would be a nice thing to do so we went to a nice restaurant in our area that we have been wanting to try and I paid for us.\n\nMy gf got a \u00a3500 bonus from work last month and when she was talking about how to spend it I jokingly asked what she was getting me. She said nothing and that she was going to treat herself to some new clothes and a night at a nice spa near us. I suggested going out for a meal like we did with my bonus and she said if we go out we'll have to split the bill since she wont be paying for the full meal. I was a little disappointed since she kept going on at me to do something for us when I got my bonus.\n\nIt's not even just the meal.

I pointed out her hypocrisy when it comes to us getting things for each other and she just said I can't tell her what to do with her money.

Its like some weird gender role thing and a really unhealthy way to view a partnership.", "Nta but she doesn't sound like a partner. She sounds like she wants to use YOUR money and HER money. Is she selfish in other ways?", "NTA. Quite frankly, she sounds like trouble. My mom told me that one of the biggest issues with my abusive father was that he would literally tell her \u201cmy money is my money and your money is my money\u201d. Your gf is selfish and wants to control you. Hate to be that person but get out while you can", "NTA assuming you\u2019re a guy. Your gf thinks that as a guy it is your responsibility to buy her things and that only goes one way. \n\nI had a gf when I was younger that expected presents on Valentine\u2019s Day but really believed as the girl she didn\u2019t need to buy me anything", "Nta red flags ahoy buddy heed them", "Pretty obviously NTA, I'm not one of those people to judge an entire relationship on one cherry picked interaction, but in this specific scenario she is definitely expecting you to do more for her than she is willing to do for you. Definitely something you guys should talk about moving forward.", "NTA. How long have you guys been dating? This is definitely something you'll want to figure out together. It's obviously unfair.", "NTA - you\u2019re just trying to have a conversation with her about life things. Nothing about that is \u201cunfair\u201d to her.", "NTA. If my partner treated me the way your gf is treating you, I would feel used and not valued as a person.", "NTA.  \"My money is mine and your money is ours\" is a huge red flag and an eventual relationship killer.", "NTA\n\nThis is a hill you most definitely should die on. Judging from this post your gf sees you as free money rather than a partner. If your relationship survives, congrats, if it doesn\u2019t then enjoy your financial freedom.", "NTA. Her money is hers and your money is hers. Run.", "NTA but you're dating one", "NTA and your Mrs is a c\\*\\*t, sorry.", "NTA but you need to get your act together. Now that the issue has been mentioned, stick to your guns and ask her for the money when she asks you to pick something up for her. Always expect to split the bill when you go for meals. Fight fire with fire and if she says anything about it, just mention that that's what you thought she expected from the relationship. Equality is the only fair way forward.", "NTA. \nBut you are on different pages when it comes to finances, and one of the most common reason for divorce is money fights.  \nJust something to keep in mind moving forward.", "NTA. If she is acting that way, just start asking for money transfers as well. Or when she mentions to tranfer her money for something just remind her that you're ok, with the last thing you bought for her.\n\nShe really is selfish and entitled. She got 500 and doesn't want to share not a single tiny part of it.", "NTA. Seems like a big red flag here, buddy.", "NTA, your girlfriend though \u2026", "NTA.  She'll do that all the time.  Don't give in to her demands.", "NTA. From now on, respond in kind. Ask her to transfer you money for picking things up from the shop. Use cash bonuses for yourself. She can either learn the lesson or you can learn who she truly is and decide whether you really want to continue with a relationship that she clearly thinks should be financially propped up by you.", "NTA\n\nFighting about money sucks, so I'd try to communicate in a positive way, that you don't want to fight about money and that you should try to keep all your finance separate for now. Meaning that you pay for your stuff and she pays for her stuff.", "NTA--- Double standard much? She seems selfish. How can she expect you to spend your bonus on her, and her not do the same? Relationships are suppose to be 50/50. You do not seem compatible with this person.", "NTA - Her brain is following the stereotype of \"my money is my money and your money is OUR money\" and that's problematic\n\nFighting over money is rough. I hope you can work it out and split the cost on more things in the future.", "NTA.... for this small issue here bro..\n\n\nBut don't you think there are bigger issues here in the relationship itself which require solving?\n\nAnyhow .. best luck mate!!", "NTA.  She's selfish and entitled.  You've pointed it out (in case she couldn't see it) and it seems to have changed nothing. I'm female and significantly older, and even I think this is wrong, so it's not just a gender thing. \n\nYou could stop picking things up for her, or treating her when you get a bonus, and that would address part of the problem.  However, I would still be bothered by the non-financial aspect of her selfishness.   Consider whether she's worth putting up with long term.  You deserve better.", "Probably NTA - it is fine to talk about how your expectations weren't met and that you wish to be treated the same way. \n\nNevertheless it is still her money and her decision. And she alone can decide how she spends it. Same goes for you and your money though. Also something to consider: Do you make significant more money then her or does she have significant more liabilities? Maybe the bonus earned is needed desperately for other things.", "NTA for pointing out the double standard in your girlfriend's behavior when it comes to spending money. It's understandable that you feel disappointed and frustrated that she expects you to spend your bonus money on her and treat her to things, but she is not willing to do the same for you. It's important to communicate your feelings and concerns in a relationship, and pointing out the hypocrisy is a fair way to do so. However, it's also important to listen to her perspective and try to understand why she may be acting this way. Maybe there are underlying financial concerns or differences in values that need to be addressed. Overall, communication and understanding are key in any relationship.", "Have a conversation where you offer her two options - either you each pay for yourselves moving forwards, or you take turns paying for each other, using a tool like Splitwise to keep things roughly even. I know lots of couples who don\u2019t have shared finances, but prefer not to split every bill, so they use Splitwise to keep track of whose turn it is to pay.", "Info - Do you make roughly equal salaries in your jobs?", "NTA. It's true. She may have the belief that because she's a woman she should be taken care of, men pay for the dates/meals... Do you make more money than her? If so, and she knows it that may factor into her reasoning. Do you live together? Are the bills split evenly? Did she somehow help you get your bonus? If so, that may also factor into her reasoning.", "NTA- unless there is a big pay difference between you.", "NAH. It's frustrating, but she likely genuinely believes due to a long history of gender roles this is how a relationship should function. Is it right? No. But she is by no means alone in this thinking and probably isn't even in the minority even to this day, so it's hard for me to genuinely call her an asshole. You just need to have a conversation and clearly outline that you expect your relationship to be an equal partnership, and if that's not what she is looking for fair to her, but it won't be with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Many women still think \"the guy is supposed to pay\", which I think is terrible.  \n\nIt's fine that you split everything, especially since you make roughly equivalent salaries, but you two need to have a conversation about this.

She's not an asshole for having outdated beliefs and expectations, it is still a very common way of thinking throughout the world. OP doesn't have to indulge her, I certainly wouldn't, but she's not an asshole just has been raised with expectations she will either have to fix or find someone who agrees."]}
