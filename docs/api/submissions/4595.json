He has been unemployed now for 13.5 months. \n\nA few months ago my neighbors found him jumping on their truck at 3am. When they asked him to get down he told them to f-off, so they called the cops. They sent him for evaluation and he was determined to have MH issues. He got meds, therapy, and seemed to be improving. Finally! The rule for him remaining at my home: take meds, get help, try to get better, get a job. He does not take drugs or drink alcohol.\n\nRecently A missed a MH appt., refused to take meds, refused therapy, and still hasn't tried to get a job. When i spoke with him about it he cursed me out, became hostile, and ended up back in the MH ward.  I was told by a counselor that I am enabling his behavior and should not let him return to my home.

If I don't, then he will only get worse. \n\nWhat I did: I visited A and told him and the MH staff that A cannot come back to my home.

Most chronically MH adults have no support system and will most definitely face homelessness, which only leads to cycles of crisis and drug/alcohol abuse. Most people with your son\u2019s diagnosis will consistently cycle on & off meds. Anti psychotics come w/ a shit ton of side effects and some people really do believe they\u2019re cured after stabilizing making them think they don\u2019t need meds. People need housing and it is essential for your son if he is going to live a fulfilling life. I can\u2019t believe a counselor would say you\u2019re enabling him when so many adults are left suffering on our streets for lack of family & community support. I would seek independent living programs for young adults with mental illness. There are day programs and peer specialists that can help. I would though caution from believing that 1) meds are 100% a cure and 2) that your son will be able to maintain employment. People w/ MH can multi-task and perform complicated work, but have a whole different set of employment issues. Erratic behavior, tardiness, calling off frequently, hygiene issues, interpersonal issues, etc\u2026", "NTA. Having worked inpatient psych, I believe that he needs more time at a good inpatient MH hospital to get him stabilized first before going anywhere. And putting him in a homeless shelter will make things worse. He went from disorganization to complete chaos. Can\u2019t be expected to take his meds in that condition.", "It is delusional to think kicking a schizophrenic out would create a good consequence in any way. You can wash your hands of him, it's never going to make him not schizophrenic.", "I know people are assuming the hospital counselor told you to kick your son out. Maybe it was but I can't imagine a certified MH counselor would tell you to kick your son out, remove all support, and leave him to the mercy of other homeless individuals. And I know our MH system is broken. But a homeless camp is never going to help him. He will never get better there. He needs inpatient care, a group home, some place where he is safe, taught to care for himself, and given the ability to get his life together. \n\nThis isn't easy and I hate passing judgement on someone who doesn't know what to do- but what was done was the wrong move.", "Man, this hurts to just read.\n\nNAH. You are dealing with an impossible choice from your son's mental illness.\n\nSome things are not always fixable :(", "NAH - I wish your son the best. It\u2019s an impossible decision many families have had to make. Him being in a homeless shelter most likely will not change his mindset for medication compliance. I\u2019m not sure where you are located but many states have mental health teams specific for people with severe mental illnesses. \n\nY T A for the addicts and criminal comments - do you know how many addicts and \u201ccriminals\u201d are mentally ill? Do you know millions of people are one paycheck away from having to stay in a homeless shelter through no fault of their own? You should really rethink those stigmas and biases you have when that\u2019s how a lot people will unfortunately view your son.", "I'm going to say NAH because this is a very difficult situation. My only question is how would staying in a homeless shelter help him? He won't be able to get the medication he needs and will become worse and worse off. I would recommend putting him in some sort of group therapy home where people can care for him and are able to 24/7.", "NTA\n\nThis is so hard. I really feel for you. It\u2019s difficult to find the line between helping and enabling.\n\nYou do know though that what you have been doing is not working. There were requirements for him to stay and he did not meet them. There have to be consequences or things will never improve.", "YTA. bring your mentally sick child(even if he is an adult..he is your baby) home so he can heal properly. Being alone in a homeless shelter wont be very helpful for his mental health. yes he has some issues but help him out with them!", "YTA. He is not going to get better being homeless. Who the hell advised you that letting a psychotic, schizophrenia individual loose without support on the street is going to get better. I became very depressed after leaving law school, my parents are first generation refugees from Laos, never set foot in school, they cried every night not knowing how to help me. They never stopped supporting me, brought food to my room, encouraged me to eat, to shower, for three freaking years, I didn't leave my room. Then one day I snapped out of my psychotic, depression, re-enrolled in a direct entry nursing program. I am now a psychiatric nurse practitioner. Your son's condition will worsen and he will turn to drugs to cope. Please find him and find him the right support to get him through this.", "NTA for turning your son out but YTA for implying that all homeless individuals are addicts and criminals", "NTA the hardest decision I'm sure you've had to make. I do suggest getting into therapy for yourself as well. This can take a toll on you. Stay strong.", "NTA, but in a bad position.\n\nThat counselor is the AH here. Using the term \"enabling\" is ableist as fuck. His mental health issues are not \"bad behavior\" that you're letting him \"get away with.\" They're what will happen anyway, and you've just been making sure he survives it. \nFeeding a cancer patient isn't \"enabling\" their cancer, even though it does feed the cancer cells. \n\nI won't say you were wrong to send him to the shelter, though. That kind of thing can be a shock to the system, and can get you on the path forward. I've been almost homeless several times on my mental health journey, and at least one did get me on a better path. But he needs to have a way out, and a relatively easy one. Don't say, \"you can come back when you have a job.\" Maybe say, \"you can come back when you've taken your meds two days straight, had an appointment with your therapist, and filled out an application for unemployment.\" And then provide him the means to do so. Even if you have to schedule his therapy session, drive him to it, bring him the application, and even bring him a pencil and the information he needs to fill it out.", "He is the asshole. Simply having a few mental issues doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t capable of controlling himself. It feels he\u2019s using that as excuse to get away with whatever he wants & that\u2019s not ok. Your completely in the right & the experience will help him understand there are consequences. Even for people who are depressed or whatever they still know what they are doing.", "Nta.", "NAH.  This is just such a sad situation.  You are definitely not the asshole because you have done everything you could.  I'm going with NAH because I'm not sure that he's an asshole either.  I know he's refusing help and meds, but it's unclear if his MH issues are influencing that decision or if it's just him being stubborn.", "I am so sorry.  My son was diagnosed w/ schizophrenia at age 20.  This on top of Autism and learning disability.  We already had guardianship when he was 18.  There have been rough patches when his meds weren't working as well as they should and it's a constant adjustment.  Fortunately he is compliant with taking his meds.  I don't think we could live with him not on those medications.  Psychosis is terrifying to witness as well as horrible for my son to remember when he comes out of it.  I know this illness can be managed, if the patient is willing, and from the sound of it your son isn't really in the right frame of mind to make good decisions.  And the hospital is also limited on what they can do for him if he refuses treatment, or medication or even counseling.  They must feel that he is capable and may just need a wake up call of sorts and prove to himself that he can take care of himself on his own. And it may not be safe for you to live with him currently.  Wishing you the best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "You\u2019re not an asshole. You\u2019re also not a mental health care provider. Your son is not an asshole. He is ill. Sometimes there are no easy solutions,  but I agree he shouldn\u2019t be in a shelter; if you can get him committed (of his own volition or not), that would be the way to go.", "This sucks, NTA but don't lose touch if you can; just try to empart to him you are there for him but if he doesn't take his meds you can't help... this sucks I'm sorry.", "It\u2019s most definitely a horrible place to be in right now but I\u2019m going with NTA. I wouldn\u2019t say that your were enabling him though, but his actions need consequences. He refused bro comply with the rules of your home so the consequence was he needed to go. These consequences may or may not help due to his MH. So like I said, a really shitty spot to be in. I\u2019ve been in a similar situation with my own kid and trying to balance the line between helping and enabling. I\u2019m sure how you exactly go about it, (cell phone, in person) but keeping in contact with him may help. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this situation and I hope that you and your son get the help he needs.", "NAH. You are not obligated to deal with it, but be sure your son is not doing whatever out of spite. Any mental health disorder can come and go and have huge ups and downs. He probably won't fare well in the shelter. But again, not your responsibility.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not familiar with boarding homes for mental health but I know ones for addiction tend to require staying sober, going to therapy etc. If he couldn't do that at his parents house, I can see it being an issue there too (let alone even being okay with going in the first place).

Psychosis is awful and I really hope he's okay, especially if this is the cause.

I didn't see it coming, he hid it well. Kids that age often dont communicate private thoughts to parents. He started having audible hallucinations and thought kids were stalking him at school. He thought I was trying to control him telepathically and would freak out if I looked at him. I was terrified of what he might do to kids at school or me. He had suicidal ideations and a hopeless outlook on life. In 1 yr he went from super happy i- cant-even-hurt-a-bug to i-want-to-die. \n\nKids were allowed an online school option in 2020 due to pandemic. Thank God. I yanked him into virtual classes asap.\n\n School admin were a bunch of fucking lazy idiots it took weeks to get him online. I went there in person and was turned away.  I  left voicemails telling them he was having psychotic episodes. They didn't care one bit. The system is broken. \n\nI tried to get him to a psychiatrist immediately.....the waiting list was 3 months. So short term i got a great mental health counselor to work with him right away. I got a break with the psychiatrist who had a last minute cancellation and only had to wait 1.5 mos.\n\nI had never been so terrified in my life.\n\nHis mental health counselor, who gets paid very little, helped him more than I can say. The psych prescribed meds.\n\nIt's been over 1 yr now. He is back at school, making friends, and has a hopeful outlook for the future. No more psychotic episodes. He thanks me a lot for getting him help and we are close. He has plans for the future. He is very much aware that things could've turned out differently. Monitoring for changes is now a way of life for me.\n\nI still dont know why it happened or what, if anything, I did wrong. What I do know is that denial is a river in Egypt. Parents need to put on their Adult Pants and just deal with shit when it happens... no matter how scary it is.\n\nWe all know that doesn't always happen else there would not be so many kids in foster care because of their craptastic parents.\n\n The school system also needs to have their own mental health counselors and empathy for kids going through problems.\n\n This tragedy didn't have to happen.\"\n\nSo how long have you known about your son's illness and how old is he truly now. If he was in cyber school in 2020, a year or two after teenage onset schizophrenia diagnosis, and then you let him move out, and now he's 26, what is the actual timeline here. Because if he was diagnosed around 15/16 years old, and he's now 26, and your thought process is \"I'll just let my delusional hallucinating severely mentally ill son sit in a homeless shelter\" then you're not coming to the internet to determine if you're an asshole.

This must be hard for you too, but you\u2019re following the advice of the people that supposedly know better. My in laws have dealt with a similar situation with their son and I know from them that just allowing them to stay home without putting their foot down only makes things worse, and the behavior tends to escalate with time. I do think you need to find a way to support your son though, for him to know that you\u2019re still there and willing to help. Not sure the homeless shelter is the best place for him to try and get better, perhaps you need to work with the doctors to find a better solution.

He despised hallucinations and does everything in his power to ensure it doesn't happen again\n\n His older brother? Just the opposite. He likes being manic and hallucinating. A counselor told me that some people get addicted to mania like drugs it makes them high. So he is aware his condition can be successfully controlled but has deliberately self-sabotaged.\n\nI have NOT given up on either of my sons. I hope that my older son chooses to stop wallowing in self pity and starts choosing to be accountable for himself.

Consider how many mentally ill people there are in the streets? Do you think they are able to get help? He won't have stability, or access to meds or anything.

There isn't really a good option in these situations, just choosing the least worst. The country your in is massively important in that decision too because if more inpatient treatment isn't an option and you also can't cope with him any more then homeless shelter is the best choice.\n\nBut you are NAH whatever you decide, you've been given an awful choice.", "I was about to completely agree with your verdict (I still completely agree with everything else you wrote), then I read one of her replies, where she says it's her son's own choice to be miserable.
