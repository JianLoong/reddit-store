She's been calling her names, stealing food from her lunch bag, scribbling on her homework answers in sharpie before it could be turned in, ripping her headband off her head and refusing to give it back, spreading rumors about her, dumping dirt in her backpack, and many more similar things.\n\nWhen I discovered the dirt in her backpack, she broke down and told me what happened. I went to the principal, and she brought Gretchen and a couple of her classmates to grill them.  I was that told several kids confirmed seeing some of the things being done to Anita, but Gretchen only given a verbal warning. I wasn't satisfied with this, but got told that there's nothing more they would do. \n\nTwo months passed and Anita told me that Gretchen was still being mean, but the more serious things like ruining/taking her things had stopped. I emailed Anita's teacher and requested a meeting with Gretchen's parents to hopefully squash the issue since this was affecting Anita's demeanor and grades. Teacher said she'd meet with me, but Gretchen's parents refused to meet. \n\nThree days after that email, Gretchen had somehow gotten my daughter's phone number and sent a slew of mean-spirited texts. Per the sub's rules, I won't repeat what they said. Anita showed me right away, and after that I finally got a meeting with the principal, Anita's teacher, and Gretchen's parents. I printed copies of every piece of evidence I had that Anita was being bullied and gave them to the principal.\n\nI laid out how the school was failing my daughter, flouted state and county-wide policy multiple times, and ultimately allowed a child to suffer. The principal changed her tune and finally started taking the situation seriously. Oddly enough, Gretchen's parents didn't do much in the way of defending their daughter, but they weren't apologetic either. \n\nI said that I want Gretchen put in another class. I know this is possible because it was done in a similar case at this school before. Gretchen's parents tried to fight this request, and I was told that Anita could be placed in another class instead. Anita is a shy child, but she has a few friends in her class. Moving her to another class in the middle of the year would cripple her ability to keep the connections she's made and only further isolate her. I stood my ground and said that either Gretchen can be moved or I can submit the evidence I've collected to the superintendent and file a formal complaint. The principal reluctantly agreed. On the way out of the meeting Gretchen mom told me that I was a \"conniving bitch\" for making the request that I did. \n\nI know Gretchen is a child, but she was bullying my daughter and faced no consequences up until now. I don't think that what I asked for is particularly harsh, but from what I could tell from Gretchen's parents it seems like she has problems, maybe I made a mistake.

You did the right thing in protecting your daughter . the school failed you. There should not be pressure for the victim to move class . \nFrankly this other child got zero punishment , no suspension , only change of class", "NTA, but you still need to report this to the school board and consult an attorney.  The principal is just moving her not handling the problem.  She is going to pick a new person to bully in the next class, and you will likely have the same issue next year.", "NTA. Good on you for standing up for your daughter when the school system wouldn't. Your daughter shouldn't have to move classes when she was the victim here. Gretchen is the one who needs to learn thatcher actions have consequences.\n\nI feel sorry for Gretchen. Many kids learn to be bullies by being bullied themselves. But you still need to protect your own daughter.", "Nta and the other mother is appalling for enabling her childs behavior. Your daughter shouldn\u2019t be punished for being bullied", "NTA. Why should the one being bullied have to be punished by changing classes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to add, I was pretty severely bullied in middle school. It was the poor kid in a school of wealthy beachfront property kids and so pretty much me against the whole class. No one ever defended me. I thought about ending it all more than once. My parents did nothing, the school did nothing. I just wished I could go to a different school. High school got better at least and I am glad I survived to reach it.\n\nMiddle school bullies are the worst... I am glad you are standing up for your daughter.", "NTA but be incredibly careful of any extra bullying Gretchen might do. Even if in a different class, this girl is in the same building as your daughter and could end up doing something potentially dangerous. This is further reinforced by the fact that it seems this kid's parents are incredibly asshole-like and the principal is an incompetent nincompoop. \n\n\nI'd suggest self-defense class or something like, telling your daughter that it's okay to fight back and that you wouldn't blame her for anything that can happen because of it.", "Nta\n\n\nAlso, save every single piece of evidence.  Document every single thing. Including the encounters with the principal.  That way, you could go even further if you need to.\n\n\nThe girls parent should be ashamed.", "NTA.  Gretchen\u2019s parents should be ashamed of themselves and it seems like she learned her spew of bad language from someone in the family.  Protect your daughter and watch like a hawk for any other attempts to bully.  I\u2019d report it to the superintendent anyway to create the initial report if anything else comes up.", "NTA. Moving your daughter to another class is punishing the victim.", "NTA.\n\nGretchen\u2019s parents should thank their lucky stars you dealt with this with the school, because by the time she started the texts this could have been a police matter.", "NTA. You did exactly what you were supposed to do. The only thing I would have done in addition to what you did is teach your child to stick up for/defend herself. Bullies always target the ones who are shy and meek. I know a lot of people hate violence but pain is the universal language. The bully will find out if they mess with her that pain is around the corner. Sorta the F around and find out.", "NTA. I am a teacher and hate bullying behavior with a passion. I do everything I can to make my classroom a safe place. But sometimes kids are just mean. And they are excellent at saving their mean behavior until a teacher\u2019s back is turned. Gretchen has tormented your daughter and hasn\u2019t responded to previous consequences. You absolutely, 100 percent made the right call.", "NTA\n\nBullying needs to be called out and prevented at all costs. Your request is reasonable and children need to learn that awful behavior has consequences attached to it.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be the victim who has to step away!", "NTA\nYou're protecting your kid and lighting a fire under the school admins butt. Just remember you won't always be there to protect her and raise her so she can do these things for herself when shes older.", "NTA\n\nAnd KUDOS to you for standing up for and protecting your daughter!", "Retired middle school teacher here. NTA!!! Thank you!!! Wish more parents were like you!! Also, your insistence about moving the bully to another class brought about direct consequences. (Something that was sorely needed.) Moving your daughter would simply have been punishing the victim. And dollars to donuts; the bully would have continued their antics either toward your child, or another student. Again, thank you!", "Absolutely, utterly, unequivocally NTA. You defended your child from a bully and from the feckless administration that failed to protect her.", "You're good, fam.

I would've called Gretchen's mom a diseased w-blank right back.", "NTA \n\nBut why are you second guessing yourself? Don't, because you did what's best for YOUR daughter. The other girl's parents need to seek counseling/therapy for their daughter and quite possibly for the entire family.", "NTA, when I was in school, I was bullied. Bullies are relentless, and I caught no break until I broke his nose.", "NTA\n\nNo real attempt was made to stop Gretchen from bullying.  And your daughter didn't deserve to be punished by moving to a new class, away from her friends.", "NTA. The school has a responsibility to provide a safe environment for your child. In my 14 years in education, I learned that some administrators take that responsibility much more seriously than others. If the bullying continues without appropriate action taken by the school, I would encourage you to reach out to a local media outlet that does \"on your side\" type reporting. There is nothing that scares a bad administrator more than media attention.", "NTA I\u2019m sure it will be hard for Gretchen to start over in a new class, but she isn\u2019t your concern. Your responsibility is to your daughter and all you did is rightfully advocate for her.", "NTA, and based on the mother's reaction to her daughter getting moved,  you know why the bully thinks it is okay to bully others.", "NTA\n\nNow you know where Gretchen gets it from.", "Sending harassing and threatening texts is a police matter, not a school matter.\n\nNTA for insisting that the kid be removed from class, but Y-T-A for not addressing this sufficiently.", "NTA!", "NTA, but I would worry about the long term ramifications from forcing a class change for her. At the end of the day, they are at the same school and will probably continue to stay at the same school for a while so the bullying may not go away, or could even get worse. You\u2019re doing the right thing by keeping an eye on it, I would just be careful about any retaliation as it may need to escalate beyond just the school.", "NTA... you're the parent looking out for your kid.  Gretchen is the offender here, not your daughter.  If her parents don't like it, they should do more.  You gave everyone one chance and they failed.  I knew of a situation where the parents stopped dealing with the school after they failed time and time again to protect their daughter and went to the police.  The policeman showed up at the parents house and basically told him to knock it off or he'd be arrested and sent to juvey.  In addition the school was told to move him or they would file a restraining order, meaning the bully couldn't be on the same floor as the daughter, let alone the same class.  That fixed it", "NTA protecting your family sometimes requires being a hard ass prick.

You have to bring all the parties involved in this mess, plus their parents, plus every piece of evidence, for them to finally understand the gravity of the situation, for them to finally DO something. That's just beyond me...\n\nNTA, NTA, NTA! And a thousand times over again!\n\nYou were obviously in the right to defend your daughter against a bully, and you take every step to ensure that her life at school is as safe as possible. You were the only ones that wasn't an AH, you and your daughter.\n\nWhat actually angers me the most are the bully's parents that actually seems to don't give a flying damn about it. They are just silent. And after that, they have the nerve to actually call you a conniving b*tch for defending your daughter, and taking action after probably MONTHS of bullying. That actually infuriates me. \n\nAnd like I said, the school that did absolutely NOTHING about it...\n\nAgain, NTA!", "NTA\n\nGretchen has problems and it sounds like it's her parents.", "Well, we know where Gretchen gets it. \n\n(I hope you  said that to her mom.)\n\nNTA", "NTA.

It's great the Principal finally relented on this matter and started to address it, but this is a sign of overall bad management.

Thank you for standing up for your daughter. So many parents fail at this, or accept the half measures.

You are a great mom.", "NTA, and advocating with/for your daughter to stand up to a bully is a great modeling of handling a tough situation without lashing back emotionally. I find any parent I talk to has to fight ten times harder to get a school to act on stopping the bullying than being the parent of a bully. We have been on both sides with doing foster care. In fact, it can be hard trying to be the good parent working to correct the issue too. Why? Because the school doesn't remain consistent in any correction plan.

I begged my parents to let me change schools, but they would not. The teachers all knew, but back then, there was no real stigma against bullying like there is today.

Nope.\n\nThe guilty party get the boot.", "NTA. Your goal in moving Gretchen was not to harm her or make some kind of power play, but to protect your daughter. People like Gretchen's parents, and unfortunately, Gretchen, don't understand this. In their minds you were defying her position in the social hierarchy, and you were doing this out of petty vengeance, not love. \n\nIt's honestly so sad, because like you said Gretchen is a kid and she's being groomed to be a bully just like her parents, with the same limited, spiteful worldview. In their view, only one person can win, and that means someone else has to lose. \n\nAgreed with other commenters to keep watching the situation closely, and also liked the suggestion to teach Anita self-defense.

She didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA fuck other people\u2019s kids all that matters is your own family. Don\u2019t screw people over but when they cross you and yours make sure you respond accordingly", "Nta", "You did the exact right thing. Moving your child would punish her. Not the bully. \nYou are a great mom.", "NTA. The parents had adequate warning that they needed to intervene and didn't.\n\nI had a similar issue with a boy bullying my daughter on the bus. I emailed the principal and they immediately contacted the bus driver and had his assigned seat moved away from my daughter.", "Not the Ah. You can clearly see where Gretchen learned her bullying from her mom.", "NTA. i feel bad that gretchen is being raised by these people who clearly excuse this behavior. i was mean as a child, partly because my parents were mean and would talk shit about strangers behind their back and thats the behavior i thought was normal (i also may be autistic, so i had trouble navigating social situations anyway). i feel awful about how i behaved as a child now, and i hope that gretchen will turn her life around later.", "OP NTA\n\nEasy to see from where Gretchen gets her charming attitude.  Ugh!\n\nDid they ride to school on the same broom?", "Nta. Gretchen\u2019s parents are awful. Your daughter doesn\u2019t deserve to be punished with a new classroom for being the victim of bullying. If Gretchen is big enough to act like such a wretched bully all day then she can deal with having to be the new kid in another class halfway through the year. Maybe it will humble her so she can have a better attitude in future school years. Hope your daughter has a better time from now on.", "You absolutely did the right thing!  \n\nIt is not your job to control or parent Gretchen. You did do everything you need to to keep your daughter safe. \n\nNext altercation, with Gretchen (bc there will be one), go to the school board. Demand a school transfer for Gretchen. Your daughter (or other kids) shouldn\u2019t suffer because of someone else\u2019s inability to parent. \n\nWhen my kid was in Kindergarten, My daughters bully, was allowed to stay in her class. We finally got her moved. But that didn\u2019t stop the bullying. We brought it up to the teachers and principal again-nothing.  We had to go to the school board for any resolution.  A school change for her bully (which the bully was later kicked out from as well). Principal fired. And the teacher that knew bullying was happening and did nothing to stop it, forced retirement.", "NTA and the mom sounds like a real peach!", "NTA. Gretchen\u2019s parents should thank their lucky stars you kept such composure and handled this so well. Clearly she\u2019s learning this behavior close to home. Good for you for defending your daughter.", "> Did I do the right thing here?\n\nWhen Gretchen commits actual crimes against your daughter (assault, theft, vandalism, stalking, threats, etc.) you should report her crimes to the police.  Crimes are still crimes even when they take place in a school.", "NTA I had a very similar experience to this when I was in high school, & I also was the one that ultimately ended up being punished by moving my classes & changing my schedule.\n\nIt drastically affected my mental health & my schoolwork, to the point that I dropped out & changed schools at the end of the year to do my last year of highschool elsewhere.\n\nI love my mum, but I honestly wish she had the spine that you do & had advocated for me harder.\n\nYou're an excellent parent.", "YTA ESH", "Why?", "Yes OP should definitely keep all that evidence. There's possiblity for them to be in another class in the future. Especially if they end up going to the same high school.\n\nOP is definitely NTA for standing up and defending her daughter.", "Yup. If we look at the past few years, a lot of school shooters were bullying victims and never saw their bully get in trouble, so they took matters into their own hands. I'm not saying this is the case, but we're not a very proactive country."]}
