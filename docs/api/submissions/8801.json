{"id": 8801, "submission_id": "10qal17", "title": "AITA for insisting that my child's bully be moved to another class?", "selftext": "My daughter \"Anita\" (11) has been dealing with bullying from a girl in her class, let's call her Gretchen. She's been calling her names, stealing food from her lunch bag, scribbling on her homework answers in sharpie before it could be turned in, ripping her headband off her head and refusing to give it back, spreading rumors about her, dumping dirt in her backpack, and many more similar things.\n\nWhen I discovered the dirt in her backpack, she broke down and told me what happened. I went to the principal, and she brought Gretchen and a couple of her classmates to grill them.  I was that told several kids confirmed seeing some of the things being done to Anita, but Gretchen only given a verbal warning. I wasn't satisfied with this, but got told that there's nothing more they would do. \n\nTwo months passed and Anita told me that Gretchen was still being mean, but the more serious things like ruining/taking her things had stopped. I emailed Anita's teacher and requested a meeting with Gretchen's parents to hopefully squash the issue since this was affecting Anita's demeanor and grades. Teacher said she'd meet with me, but Gretchen's parents refused to meet. \n\nThree days after that email, Gretchen had somehow gotten my daughter's phone number and sent a slew of mean-spirited texts. Per the sub's rules, I won't repeat what they said. Anita showed me right away, and after that I finally got a meeting with the principal, Anita's teacher, and Gretchen's parents. I printed copies of every piece of evidence I had that Anita was being bullied and gave them to the principal.\n\nI laid out how the school was failing my daughter, flouted state and county-wide policy multiple times, and ultimately allowed a child to suffer. The principal changed her tune and finally started taking the situation seriously. Oddly enough, Gretchen's parents didn't do much in the way of defending their daughter, but they weren't apologetic either. \n\nI said that I want Gretchen put in another class. I know this is possible because it was done in a similar case at this school before. Gretchen's parents tried to fight this request, and I was told that Anita could be placed in another class instead. Anita is a shy child, but she has a few friends in her class. Moving her to another class in the middle of the year would cripple her ability to keep the connections she's made and only further isolate her. I stood my ground and said that either Gretchen can be moved or I can submit the evidence I've collected to the superintendent and file a formal complaint. The principal reluctantly agreed. On the way out of the meeting Gretchen mom told me that I was a \"conniving bitch\" for making the request that I did. \n\nI know Gretchen is a child, but she was bullying my daughter and faced no consequences up until now. I don't think that what I asked for is particularly harsh, but from what I could tell from Gretchen's parents it seems like she has problems, maybe I made a mistake.

You did the right thing in protecting your daughter . the school failed you. There should not be pressure for the victim to move class . \nFrankly this other child got zero punishment , no suspension , only change of class", "NTA, but you still need to report this to the school board and consult an attorney.  The principal is just moving her not handling the problem.  She is going to pick a new person to bully in the next class, and you will likely have the same issue next year.", "NTA. Good on you for standing up for your daughter when the school system wouldn't. Your daughter shouldn't have to move classes when she was the victim here. Gretchen is the one who needs to learn thatcher actions have consequences.\n\nI feel sorry for Gretchen. Many kids learn to be bullies by being bullied themselves. But you still need to protect your own daughter.", "Nta and the other mother is appalling for enabling her childs behavior. Your daughter shouldn\u2019t be punished for being bullied", "NTA. Why should the one being bullied have to be punished by changing classes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to add, I was pretty severely bullied in middle school. It was the poor kid in a school of wealthy beachfront property kids and so pretty much me against the whole class. No one ever defended me. I thought about ending it all more than once. My parents did nothing, the school did nothing. I just wished I could go to a different school. High school got better at least and I am glad I survived to reach it.\n\nMiddle school bullies are the worst... I am glad you are standing up for your daughter.", "NTA but be incredibly careful of any extra bullying Gretchen might do. Even if in a different class, this girl is in the same building as your daughter and could end up doing something potentially dangerous. This is further reinforced by the fact that it seems this kid's parents are incredibly asshole-like and the principal is an incompetent nincompoop. \n\n\nI'd suggest self-defense class or something like, telling your daughter that it's okay to fight back and that you wouldn't blame her for anything that can happen because of it.", "Nta\n\n\nAlso, save every single piece of evidence.  Document every single thing. Including the encounters with the principal.  That way, you could go even further if you need to.\n\n\nThe girls parent should be ashamed.", "NTA.  Gretchen\u2019s parents should be ashamed of themselves and it seems like she learned her spew of bad language from someone in the family.  Protect your daughter and watch like a hawk for any other attempts to bully.  I\u2019d report it to the superintendent anyway to create the initial report if anything else comes up.", "NTA. Moving your daughter to another class is punishing the victim.", "NTA.\n\nGretchen\u2019s parents should thank their lucky stars you dealt with this with the school, because by the time she started the texts this could have been a police matter.", "NTA. You did exactly what you were supposed to do. The only thing I would have done in addition to what you did is teach your child to stick up for/defend herself. Bullies always target the ones who are shy and meek. I know a lot of people hate violence but pain is the universal language. The bully will find out if they mess with her that pain is around the corner. Sorta the F around and find out.", "NTA. I am a teacher and hate bullying behavior with a passion. I do everything I can to make my classroom a safe place. But sometimes kids are just mean. And they are excellent at saving their mean behavior until a teacher\u2019s back is turned. Gretchen has tormented your daughter and hasn\u2019t responded to previous consequences. You absolutely, 100 percent made the right call.", "NTA\n\nBullying needs to be called out and prevented at all costs. Your request is reasonable and children need to learn that awful behavior has consequences attached to it.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be the victim who has to step away!", "NTA\nYou're protecting your kid and lighting a fire under the school admins butt. Just remember you won't always be there to protect her and raise her so she can do these things for herself when shes older.", "NTA\n\nAnd KUDOS to you for standing up for and protecting your daughter!", "Retired middle school teacher here. NTA!!! Thank you!!! Wish more parents were like you!! Also, your insistence about moving the bully to another class brought about direct consequences. (Something that was sorely needed.) Moving your daughter would simply have been punishing the victim. And dollars to donuts; the bully would have continued their antics either toward your child, or another student. Again, thank you!", "Absolutely, utterly, unequivocally NTA. You defended your child from a bully and from the feckless administration that failed to protect her.", "You're good, fam. You're child is your responsibility, and up to this point you're the only one acting to protect and defend her. Whatever is needed, DO IT. Let the bully's parents work on her issues; you work on your daughter's issues. I recommend therapy and martial arts training.", "NTA. I would've called Gretchen's mom a diseased w-blank right back.", "NTA \n\nBut why are you second guessing yourself? Don't, because you did what's best for YOUR daughter. The other girl's parents need to seek counseling/therapy for their daughter and quite possibly for the entire family.", "NTA, when I was in school, I was bullied. Bullies are relentless, and I caught no break until I broke his nose.", "NTA\n\nNo real attempt was made to stop Gretchen from bullying.  And your daughter didn't deserve to be punished by moving to a new class, away from her friends.", "NTA. The school has a responsibility to provide a safe environment for your child. In my 14 years in education, I learned that some administrators take that responsibility much more seriously than others. If the bullying continues without appropriate action taken by the school, I would encourage you to reach out to a local media outlet that does \"on your side\" type reporting. There is nothing that scares a bad administrator more than media attention.", "NTA I\u2019m sure it will be hard for Gretchen to start over in a new class, but she isn\u2019t your concern. Your responsibility is to your daughter and all you did is rightfully advocate for her.", "NTA, and based on the mother's reaction to her daughter getting moved,  you know why the bully thinks it is okay to bully others.", "NTA\n\nNow you know where Gretchen gets it from.", "Sending harassing and threatening texts is a police matter, not a school matter.\n\nNTA for insisting that the kid be removed from class, but Y-T-A for not addressing this sufficiently.", "NTA!", "NTA, but I would worry about the long term ramifications from forcing a class change for her. At the end of the day, they are at the same school and will probably continue to stay at the same school for a while so the bullying may not go away, or could even get worse. You\u2019re doing the right thing by keeping an eye on it, I would just be careful about any retaliation as it may need to escalate beyond just the school.", "NTA... you're the parent looking out for your kid.  Gretchen is the offender here, not your daughter.  If her parents don't like it, they should do more.  You gave everyone one chance and they failed.  I knew of a situation where the parents stopped dealing with the school after they failed time and time again to protect their daughter and went to the police.  The policeman showed up at the parents house and basically told him to knock it off or he'd be arrested and sent to juvey.  In addition the school was told to move him or they would file a restraining order, meaning the bully couldn't be on the same floor as the daughter, let alone the same class.  That fixed it", "NTA protecting your family sometimes requires being a hard ass prick. We don't know what's going on in Gretchen's life but it doesn't matter because you gotta protect your daughter.\n\nHer parents can be as mad as they want but they'd wouldn't be in this mess if they'd did their jobs correctly.", " I HATE school bullying, and it's even worse where the school staff don't make a damn thing about it! You have to bring all the parties involved in this mess, plus their parents, plus every piece of evidence, for them to finally understand the gravity of the situation, for them to finally DO something. That's just beyond me...\n\nNTA, NTA, NTA! And a thousand times over again!\n\nYou were obviously in the right to defend your daughter against a bully, and you take every step to ensure that her life at school is as safe as possible. You were the only ones that wasn't an AH, you and your daughter.\n\nWhat actually angers me the most are the bully's parents that actually seems to don't give a flying damn about it. They are just silent. And after that, they have the nerve to actually call you a conniving b*tch for defending your daughter, and taking action after probably MONTHS of bullying. That actually infuriates me. \n\nAnd like I said, the school that did absolutely NOTHING about it...\n\nAgain, NTA!", "NTA\n\nGretchen has problems and it sounds like it's her parents.", "Well, we know where Gretchen gets it. \n\n(I hope you  said that to her mom.)\n\nNTA", "NTA. From the Sound of Gretchen's mom. Know where she learned it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your daughter deserves to go to school and learn in peace.  As others have mentioned, if the texts were threatening, please report it to the police.", "NTA, but you haven't done the right thing yet.\n\nThe right thing is hiring a lawyer to submit a formal complaint to the School Board, and have a formal policy enacted to ensure this does not happen to another student ever again.  It's great the Principal finally relented on this matter and started to address it, but this is a sign of overall bad management.  If the Principal put you through this much of a fight, imagine how many other students they are probably failing!  The Principal and School Board need to be held accountable and receive proper training - and that rarely comes without threat of an embarrassing lawsuit.", "NTA \n\nThe victim should not be moved unless they want to. They would see that as the victim gets punished instead of bully. Gretchen should be moved or escalate to school board.", "Nta. I don't see why the victim should be move, it's the bully who needs to \"pay the price\" (in this case, the discomfort of changing class, which seems fair).\nI don't think Gretchen will learn much, though, because her parents don't seem to want to actually \"parent\" her.", "NTA. Thank you for standing up for your daughter. So many parents fail at this, or accept the half measures. So many still think bullying is \"kids being kids\" and will \"toughen them up\" and \"it's just part of life, you have to deal with it\" and other nonsense excuses for failing to truly teach kids.", "NTA. Obviously we know where Gretchen gets her mean spirited bullying lessons from.", "NTA: Why has this girl not been suspended or expelled for unrelenting bullying of your daughter? She\u2019s fortunate that she\u2019s only being made to switch classrooms. Her parents are enabling this behavior. Her mother calling you out of name, leads me to suspect that she\u2019s a bully herself.", "NTA : You were hundred percent right in protect your child from a bully. I am just sorry for the other child she needs therapy. You are a great mom.", "NTA, and advocating with/for your daughter to stand up to a bully is a great modeling of handling a tough situation without lashing back emotionally. I find any parent I talk to has to fight ten times harder to get a school to act on stopping the bullying than being the parent of a bully. We have been on both sides with doing foster care. In fact, it can be hard trying to be the good parent working to correct the issue too. Why? Because the school doesn't remain consistent in any correction plan. You did what needed to be done, for your daughter, and those that will be after her.", "NTA.  Your child is the one who has been suffering, and you were absolutely right to insist that Gretchen is the one to be moved.  Anita should be able to stay with her friends, otherwise she will learn that speaking up will only get herself punished further.  If it's easy to move Anita to another class, it's just as easy to move Gretchen.", "NTA - you did the right thing for your daughter, Gretchen's parents can do the right thing for her.  Unfortunately for Gretchen's parents the law is on your side and Gretchen sounds like a horrible child raised by horrible parents, so they'll have fun with that.", "NTA. Gretchen is the problem, therefore she's the one who should face any negative consequences of her actions. Unfortunately, it's no wonder she acts the way that she does with parents like hers.", "NTA obviously the bully should be the one punished by moving, not the victim.", "NTA!!!\n\nI wish this had been an option for my child. She lost all of her friends when I had to change her (kindergarten) class. But, in her case, it was the teacher who was bullying her. The principal would do nothing and didn\u2019t even want to move my child. I still wish that the teacher had been fired, my daughter is in 6th grade now and still hasn\u2019t recovered from having to put up with the emotional and mental abuse from this teacher. She alienated her from all the friends she had made the second she found out my daughter was being moved from her class.\n\nYou made the right move, removing the bully instead of your daughter. It also reinforces that she did NOTHING to deserve this and is being protected, not punished.\n\nVery much, NTA", "NTA, the bully is the source of the problem why should your daughter the victim pay for it, if she has problems she has to get help but its her parents obligation to look into that, not yours, good for standing up to your daughter and keep the evidence just in case.", "NTA. I had a similar situation with my kid. The school protected the bully and fought me every step of the way. Vice principal outright said I was \u201cignoring my privilege\u201d and that I should be concerned with the well-being of the bully and that I was trying to \u201ctake away his right to an education\u201d. \n\nThey only relented when I told them I was going to use my \u201cprivilege\u201d to sue the school, the district, and him personally the next time my kid was attacked at school. They somehow managed to move the bully to another class. \n\nFrom that point on I just didn\u2019t play anymore. The following year when it started again I told them I wanted the paperwork to take him out of school, magically the school stepped in right away. And the next year when some kids went around threatening to murder other kids including my kid, I just called the cops.", "NTA You did well advocating for your child and it\u2019s frustrating the school isn\u2019t taking it more seriously.\n\nIt\u2019s infuriating that they would say the only solution is to punish your daughter who did NOTHING wrong.\n\nMy response to the other mom would\u2019ve been \u201cWell I see where you\u2019re daughter got it from\u201d", "NTA. School admin can be spineless and fail to meet the needs of good students so they can cater to students like Gretchen. I applaud you for standing up for your daughter.", "NTA and it's clear that Gretchen's issues are caused by her unpleasant parents. Apples and trees and all that.", "OP, I was a teacher, and I have a child this age. I honestly would have had her removed earlier. That level of bullying can hurt a kid's self-esteem for a long time.\n\nBut, keep records and notes of all of this in case this girl continues to find ways to bully your daughter.", "This. In some states schools can be charged varying degrees of neglect for not acting. Gretchen deserved to be moved bc she is the problem. NTA.", "Man, I knew I was not the only one who went through this, but that did not make reading this any easier. Surviving is exactly what it was. I begged my parents to let me change schools, but they would not. The teachers all knew, but back then, there was no real stigma against bullying like there is today. I'm 56 years old, and it still makes my bowels weak to think about those days. It took me years to rebuild my self-esteem. \n\nOP, you are NTA. Thank you, from someone else's bullied daughter.", "I doubt she'll have a hard time at all. Kids like her can always find a new victim to bully and a new clique of enablers to rally around them.", "Following up on this point, you are your daughter\u2019s advocate and that\u2019s your job. If Gretchen needs help, then that is up to her parents and the school to provide it for her. You are not responsible for her. \n\nNTA \u2026 and I\u2019d follow the advice elsewhere in this thread and help your daughter learn to stand up for herself.", "It's both.
