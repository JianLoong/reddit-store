I don't have that and as a male can't know what period pain feels like, but I was hit by a car while on a bicycle and nearly died. My pain tolerance as a result definitely increased, so much that a tooth abscess wasn't that bad. Which sounds eerily similar to your description of the needle to the face. I know for me, a lot of the time you wouldn't realize I was in pain, I didn't have a day for over a year without some pain related to what happened. But there were times the pain gets too much, and people would ask what was wrong. The difference here is when I told people why it's something they can understand, while for you it's something they may not understand. Invalidating your suffering is so wrong. It doesn't matter at the end of the day what the cause is, the fact remains that you feel in excruciating pain. That's all that matter, and their response should reflect that.\n\nThey're all the assholes. They don't understand because they have not never experienced pain anywhere close or even imagine what pain of that level feels like. I feel for you, I really do. It takes guts to wake up everyday and push through the pain you might feel and just do what needs to be done. I believe you when you say it's agony. I know I wouldn't want anyone to experience pain like I did, and if someone was in excruciating pain, I would want to help them, not doubt what they were telling me. There isn't a single thing you did wrong here.\n\n\nEdit: changed the wording a bit to focus on OP more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't have endo but one of my biggest pet peeves is people conflating regular cramps with endo cramps. Even regular cramps not related to endo can be debilitating! Good for you for sticking up for yourself, you're right, he doesn't have a clue. He was being incredibly demeaning.", "NTA\n\nI don't have endometriosis, just cramps, headaches, nausea and colic to the point of passing out if I stand. And I don't even want to imagine that in my everyday life \ud83d\ude30\n\nI'm sorry for your situation.", "NTA obviously. I am sorry that you are going through this. How old are your classmates? It seems like they are children whose parents haven't taught them much about empathy, understanding, and tolerance of other people. Either way, they seem like idiots, and there is no point arguing with an idiot. If this happens again, I would recommend instead of bothering to explain yourself, don't give them your time at all, theyre not worth it.\n\n I would recommend looking at remedies for this condition. Remedies, not medication. Perhaps there are some foods or teas that can make it a little easier, or maybe even exercises or meditation.", "NTA and I'm sorry you are in pain near those assholes. I hope you have good OB with some ideas of treatment. Take care!", "Your classmate is so ignorant and insensitive. It's disheartening to see people dismiss the pain and struggles that come with endometriosis. You have every right to defend yourself and educate others about your condition. NTA, OP. Keep spreading awareness and never let anyone undermine your experiences.", "Those people suck Nta", "NTA but nobody will ever take your condition seriously specifically because you're a girl.  You might as well get used to the misogyny now, because it's only ever going to get worse, especially after the next US election.", "NTA-I have endometriosis as well as a small handful of conditions that cause daily pain. If anyone tried to tell me I wasn\u2019t feeling what I was feeling or that my pain tolerance was simply incredibly low I\u2019d be livid.", "NTA at all. Your friend is extremely ignorant. It\u2019s exactly that sort of attitude that means so many women don\u2019t get the help they need for serious conditions. The behaviour displayed by your classmates is bullying", "NTA. But they\u2019re not worth your time. I suffered from endometriosis for years until I finally got surgery. It\u2019s horrible, and you are correct, they could never understand. Sorry you are going through it, but you shouldn\u2019t have to explain yourself to people. They are ignorant.", "NTA\n\nI just love when guys try to mansplain period pain to the women who actually experience it. He has no idea what he is talking about, and I really feel sorry for any woman who ends up in a relationship with him, because he won't take their pain seriously.", "NTA, overall men that tell us that we can\u2019t be in pain piss me off so if I had endometriosis and someone told me that I would genuinely kick him in the balls", "Thank you so so much. This means a lot.", "We\u2019re actually in university believe it or not. I\u2019m 20. I\u2019ve been dealing with this condition since I was 12. I\u2019ve tried remedies and exercise and it\u2019s never made a difference. I can barely even walk some days and that\u2019s not an exaggeration.", "Thank you so much", "Agreed. Laughing at her and shutting the door on her face is also bullying. Op, NTA. I\u2019m so sorry you experienced this in addition to your pain.", "I actually get told all the time my pain isn\u2019t real. It\u2019s so frustrating.", "You're welcome, changed wording a bit. I would hope that pain relievers could help even a little bit. They didn't take mine away when it was bad, but they made it far more bearable, well pain killers and muscle relaxers. I'm not familiar with endometriosis so I'm not sure how it works, definitely something to look up.", "I have another little understood condition that mostly affects women- Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension. All the time I get, \u201cOh, so it\u2019s just a headache\u201d. It\u2019s not. Your pain is real and your classmate is a jerk. For depressing reference- study after study has shown even doctors (even female doctors) disbelieve women\u2019s reports of pain (often through implicit, rather than explicit bias).", "It really is."]}
