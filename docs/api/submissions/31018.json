I don't have that and as a male can't know what period pain feels like, but I was hit by a car while on a bicycle and nearly died. My pain tolerance as a result definitely increased, so much that a tooth abscess wasn't that bad. Which sounds eerily similar to your description of the needle to the face. I know for me, a lot of the time you wouldn't realize I was in pain, I didn't have a day for over a year without some pain related to what happened. But there were times the pain gets too much, and people would ask what was wrong. The difference here is when I told people why it's something they can understand, while for you it's something they may not understand. Invalidating your suffering is so wrong. It doesn't matter at the end of the day what the cause is, the fact remains that you feel in excruciating pain. That's all that matter, and their response should reflect that.\n\nThey're all the assholes. They don't understand because they have not never experienced pain anywhere close or even imagine what pain of that level feels like. I feel for you, I really do. It takes guts to wake up everyday and push through the pain you might feel and just do what needs to be done. I believe you when you say it's agony. I know I wouldn't want anyone to experience pain like I did, and if someone was in excruciating pain, I would want to help them, not doubt what they were telling me.

Anything that goes against this narrative is shut down hard because men can be the only ultimate victims and oppressed ones. Or it's shut down because it's seen as hating men to acknowledge that women have issues. That's why any discussion about issues women face such as rape, domestic violence, sexual harassment always have the majority of male responses going What about men / men have it worse / what about false accusations.\n\nDo not expect sympathy from men and even from particular women who want male validation.

I had random appendicitis symptoms on and off cyclically from around age 17 but clean scans and clean labs so people called me a hypochondriac. Turned out I was right that something was wrong there, I just wasn't right about what it was-- but how was _I_ supposed to know? The medical system just consistently fails us.", ">\"Wait until you have children, then you'll know what it's like to be tired!\"\n\nI hate this line. I have an autoimmune disease that causes fatigue. My immune system is literally attacking my digestive system. Tell me that doesn't sound exhausting.\n\nAlso, you choose to have kids. Nobody chooses this shit.", "I have Endo and had Adenomyosis. I had a total hysterectomy with BSO when I was 32 years old. The hysterectomy cured the Adenomyosis ( it\u2019s found only inside the uterus, and therefore removing the uterus cured it). My Endo pain is near nonexistent. I was very lucky to find a gyno who listened to me. I was diagnosed and had my hysterectomy 5 months later. \nThe pain was beyond unbearable. I tried to fatally hurt myself once when the pain got so bad that I started to dissociate and hallucinate that I could cut the pain out.", "Hysterectomies don\u2019t cure endo. It can grow back. The best thing is to see an endo specialist. Dr. Nezhat actually invented the laparoscopic hysterectomy and he also is a endo specialist and he won\u2019t do a hysterectomy for endo unless he\u2019s exhausted all other methods.", ">and my insurance will only cover it if the doctor can prove I\u2019m infertile.\n\nSo even the insurance is obsessed with women getting children? That is just so crap. The human race won't die out just because some women don't get children. If you want an operation and are fine with not getting children as a result, they should just accept it and pay to lessen your pain.", "Many Docs practice Medicine  with \u201c avoid lawsuits \u201c as their ethical guide .", ".", "It almost sounds like a faster route to a hysterectomy would be to say your transgender and having a period causes you gender dysphoria... And so you need to have a hysterectomy first.", "It's not about her hypothetical desire to have kids, it's about society's desire of getting more future tax payers", "I understand that, however I fail to see how being able to make a decision about my body and my life, as opposed to some futuristic mythical man would result in a lawsuit, especially given you need to sign consent and waivers to undergo said surgery. I was and am a competent, well informed person, regardless of my gender. My colleague decided to have a vasectomy as he doesn't want children (is 24) and got it, without the medical reason for it, because his choice was respected. Clearly, as a society, we still value a man's opinion and autonomy more than a woman's.", "Wow. Can we sue when this happens? Or better yet do a class action suit of women because women are being denied healthcare?", "I think they should just own it in that case and say so. I think fear of being sued is reasonable, some of the excuses women are given are not reasonable.", "I am not disagreeing with you--just stating  what  I have heard them say is their thought process.", "I was lucky, my doctor didn't argue with me about a tubal ligation.  She asked why, I said, my husband is sterile (cancer treatment) but my boyfriend is not, and I don't want to get pregnant.  She stifled any protest and I got fixed right away.", "Yep! I finally had the surgery last year. I ended up finding my doctor through r/childfree. She and her office were so kind to me, never pushed back on my decision, and only asked about my husband when we were discussing post surgery details."]}
