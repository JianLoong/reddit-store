I don't have that and as a male can't know what period pain feels like, but I was hit by a car while on a bicycle and nearly died. My pain tolerance as a result definitely increased, so much that a tooth abscess wasn't that bad. Which sounds eerily similar to your description of the needle to the face. I know for me, a lot of the time you wouldn't realize I was in pain, I didn't have a day for over a year without some pain related to what happened. But there were times the pain gets too much, and people would ask what was wrong. The difference here is when I told people why it's something they can understand, while for you it's something they may not understand. Invalidating your suffering is so wrong. It doesn't matter at the end of the day what the cause is, the fact remains that you feel in excruciating pain. That's all that matter, and their response should reflect that.\n\nThey're all the assholes. They don't understand because they have not never experienced pain anywhere close or even imagine what pain of that level feels like. I feel for you, I really do. It takes guts to wake up everyday and push through the pain you might feel and just do what needs to be done. I believe you when you say it's agony. I know I wouldn't want anyone to experience pain like I did, and if someone was in excruciating pain, I would want to help them, not doubt what they were telling me.

Anything that goes against this narrative is shut down hard because men can be the only ultimate victims and oppressed ones. Or it's shut down because it's seen as hating men to acknowledge that women have issues. That's why any discussion about issues women face such as rape, domestic violence, sexual harassment always have the majority of male responses going What about men / men have it worse / what about false accusations.\n\nDo not expect sympathy from men and even from particular women who want male validation.

It can literally shorten life expectancy to lose hormones young (which I have, as a result of cancer treatments).\n\nI wish doctors were honest as to WHY they think it might not be a good decision instead of faffing around.", "My doctor herself doesn\u2019t want to do it because of how invasive it is. I\u2019d be so worried about the cost too. Do you happen to know what the odds are if a successful appeal if I find a good specialist?", "Okay fair. You don\u2019t seem to be willing to listen, but the reason this affects me is because he\u2019s nowhere near the first person to give me crap about my condition. While i said I\u2019ve had many male classmates be very understanding, I\u2019ve also had several (both male and female actually) tell me just get over it and it\u2019s not that bad. While I am used to the comments, I\u2019m becoming super burnt out by all of this ignorance. You\u2019re right, he\u2019s ignorant. That\u2019s what\u2019s so frustrating. That no one is even willing to just have the slightest bit of patience.", "Because not all people think like you buddy, it's pretty normal to feel annoyed and try to convice an ignorant person, that's like the basis of 90% of online confrontations", "I'm sorry, I don't. But you'd have the surgeon appeal before surgery, and have an idea of cost beforehand. It's worth trying, for sure! You'll probably have to pay a specialist doctor visit copay to be seen and have them fight for you. And if you're in the US, you can make payments on your surgery. I had 2 surgeries I'm 2019, and I'm paying them off this month actually."]}
