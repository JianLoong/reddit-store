I told my dad- no one apologized & excuses were made- \"she felt left out\" (they've been together for 3 years and I'm an adult- she and I don't have a relationship.\n\nMy dad went so far as to tell me she's the \"nicest woman he's ever met\" - despite the fact that she's said rude things to and about me and my brother for some time now - and he's lost lifelong friends due to her rudeness & alcoholism. None of his family will say anything to him because he bankrolls all of them for trips, dinners, whatever they want.\n\nBack to thanksgiving- I wanted to extend the olive branch because my dad & I have always been close. I invite him & his gf - and then he tells me her adult son (30) will be with them and I need to invite him too. I feel like it is always something. I'm a big mental health advocate- but her son is schizophrenic and refuses treatment - having recently written several threatening things about my brother & family (and he has a history of outbursts against his own family in the past)- so I am not comfortable having him there. My brother also expressed that he'd be very uncomfortable with it as well. My dad is acting like I'm being unreasonable & didn't already go out of my comfort zone to invite my dad & his gf. I told him I love him & I'm his family- that he is invited & I'd love to have him there - he said he would figure out what to do - but then told me that he'll just go to my Aunt's since he \"isn't welcome\" at my thanksgiving.\n\nAm I the asshole? I don't want to be the Brady Bunch- I don't want this lady or her kids around me and my family- but I love my dad. I understand that they're together - but he's my dad - not this kid's & I don't think he should be choosing her and her family.", "created_utc": 1667400935, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yk7ee5/aita_for_not_inviting_my_dads_gfs_son_to/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't invite any of them. Sounds harsh but would it be worth it? You want to make the relationship with your dad better, but he also needs to want this. It sounds like his alcoholism and fun time girlfriend are ruling his choices right now. Take some more distance and leave it be. Don't give up your peace of mind for the CHANCE that this time she might be nicer. Your dad's choice doesn't have to be your choice.\n\nNtA", "Well you have the right to invite who you want and don\u2019t want at the party . If you don\u2019t want the son to come then that\u2019s how it is going to be but at the same time don\u2019t be upset when your father and his gf decline the  offer and stay home . \n\nOne more thing i wanted to add- your father is an adult , he is responsible for his drinking and his actions . You may not like her but his actions and drinking are on him . It seems like you don\u2019t like her and because of that it\u2019s easier for you to blame her instead of him .  His actions are on him 100%-", "NTA\n\nYou just experienced \"give and inch and they will try to take a foot\" and dealt with is pretty deftly.   Your father's in the wrong and if he isn't paying attention to the large number of people that aren't in his life anymore because of this woman that's his choice.", "NTA, your place, your rules. If he chooses them, that's his fault , not yours. Try to have a great time with the people who care enough about you to respect your boundaries", "NTA.\n\nYou invite who you want, and they are free to accept or decline.  \n\nIt's OK for a guest to request an additional invitation, but certainly you don't have to agree.\n\nYour dad is the AH for the \"I'm not welcome\" comment, which is 1) not true and  2) manipulative.", "You\u2019re NTA here.  You invited your father, he declined.  His choice.  That\u2019s not on you, it\u2019s on him.", "NTA\nIf the son has made threats, don't invite him anywhere near you.", "NTA. I think you were great to invite the girlfriend. That\u2019s enough. However, if the adult son is visiting them for the holiday, it would be rude for them to go to dinner & leave him behind. Good luck to your aunt & the people at her dinner.", "Given the back ground that you\u2019ve explained here, if it were any other question about your dad/his gf, I\u2019d probably say n t a, but in terms of this invite, I have to say NAH. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable you\u2019re uncomfortable having her son at your house for the holiday, but I\u2019m guessing he doesn\u2019t really have anywhere else to go. \n\nYou can\u2019t really expect that his gf would have Thanksgiving without her son, and you can\u2019t really expect your dad to have Thanksgiving without his gf. \n\nAs justified as you are in your reasoning, accepting your invitation would force him to exclude someone else and put him in an awkward position. \n\nHis choice here is simply accepting the invitation that doesn\u2019t force him to exclude someone. I think you need to respect that decision. \n\nAlso, to be blunt, this really isn\u2019t an olive branch to his gf if you\u2019re expecting her to exclude her son from the holiday. She\u2019s likely to see this more as an insult than a nice gesture.  I certainly understand your reasoning, but I think you need to understand that it will never be a good rationale for her. Just like you\u2019re unhappy with your dad choosing her and her family over you, can you imagine how her son would feel if she chose to accept your invitation excluding him over spending the holidays with him? At least you have other people to be with for the holiday.", "NTA- uninvite them altogether. It may be hard, but at a certain point it\u2019s a matter of choice, you choose your kids over your partner 100% in any situation. This woman has treated you horribly and your dad chooses to keep her around anyway. We may love our family members but sometimes loving someone isn\u2019t enough reason to keep them in your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
