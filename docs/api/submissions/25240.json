If it's relevant I'm in my thirties and the co-worker is in her fifties.\n\nSo the current situation is as follows:\n\nLast week she told us she had to leave work early, but didn't specify why. I later heard from another co-worker that it was some kind of problem in her family. She was back the next day and didn't say anything about it to me. I figured it was personal and kept out of it.\n\nYesterday she left work again, this time without telling anyone why except one co-worker. This co-worker later told me it was because her daughter needed to be taken to the emergency room because she had been diagnosed with diabetes.\n\nThis morning the co-worker in question was back. We exchanged the usual pleasantries in the morning and had some interactions related to work but nothing more. At lunch she was fuming, she told me she thought I was callous because I didn't ask about her daughters health. She said she knew the other co-worker told me the situation yesterday so the only reason I didn't ask was because i didn't care.  I told her I didn't want to interfere in her personal life and she stormed off.\n\nSo my thinking is that considering our relationship I thought she would tell me if she wanted me to know about it, or wanted to talk about it. Since she didn't I didn't ask her about her daughter because to me that is interfering in someones private/personal life.\n\nAm I the asshole for not asking her about her daughter?", "created_utc": 1692702560, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15y2lt5/aita_for_not_asking_about_a_coworkers_daughter/", "score": 305, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I'm told something by other means I do ask are they OK but wouldn't push it. I went on a mental health course and one thing I learnt was ask someone twice as people usually default to saying yeah I'm OK thanks the first time. So if you are concerned after asking are you ok? You would say are you sure your OK? But I wouldn't do this every greeting just for someone you were concerned about. She is probably just very stressed and lashing out.", "NTA\n\nYour work colleagues not friends. Your not obligated to ask anybody at work about their personal lives.", "NTA unless She tells you about herself and her situation it is none of your business.", "NTA. You don't have a close relationship with her, and keeping it professional by not asking about her personal life is totally acceptable.

She just wanted attention. When my mum died some folks who knew said something or were checking in on me and some folks either didn't feel they were close enough to me to want to mention it to me or didn't know.

There is no reason for her to expect you to be concerned or comment about her child. The project? Yes. Maybe her? But that\u2019s stretching it per how you\u2019ve laid out the story. \n\nIf an apology is needed to get the team dynamics back state something like: As the information about your non-work situation did not come directly from you I figured it best to not comment about it in case you wanted to keep work and personal life separate, as I generally do. I\u2019m sorry if this offended you.", "It depends on the daughter's situation.", ">People like this are\n\ndrama queens, with which you can only lose.

It's not unprofessional, and it's not overly intrusive either.

You had simply heard a rumor. It is unfair of her to say nothing of the situation, and then be upset that you did not inquire.", "NTA.  Since you heard about it second hand, you were right to keep out of it.  Since you don't typically discuss your personal lives, I don't get why she was so angry.", "NTA \n\nIt is rude to interject yourself into someone else\u2019s personal business.

It really varies person to person and it's better to err on the side of giving a person their privacy. My dad had a heart attack and I told my boss and one coworker cause I needed some help wrapping stuff up while I was gone.\n\nMy boss accidentally let it slip and I got bombarded with a bunch of messages checking in and other people were the last thing I wanted to deal with, even if it was just a short \"We're ok\" message. I really didn't care that my boss had told other people, I just didn't want to be bothered about it.\n\nI know other people who are very private and would be pissed their boss shared that information and I know people who would really appreciate the check-ins. Since you and your coworker aren't close, I think you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nYou had no way of knowing if what anyone was saying about her situation wasn't purely speculation. It's unfair and unreasonable of her to go off at you for not asking about something she didn't tell you about, especially when you are both not in the habit of discussing personal matters with each other.", "NTA. Sounds like she's projecting her anger/frustration onto you", "Your thinking is absolutely correct. If she wanted to discuss her private life with you, then it is on her to tell you about it. You were respecting her privacy. \n\nI'd tell her that. \"I'm sorry, I was respecting your privacy. You didn't mention anything to me directly so I didn't feel it my place to bring up the subject.

Even the you were work friends, she doesn't get to demand interest or inquiries from you. If she needed to share, she could've done so without the drama and within reasonable work-friend limits.\n\nI know this is not the same situation, but the other day I was with a coworker in the office and I was really worried as I had left my car with a mechanic and was waiting for him to call me and tell me how much it would cost. I expected something along 100 Euro and when he told me 5 times as much, I was really fighting despair and let out something like \"Boy, did he surprise me with this call!\". My coworker just raised an eyebrow, so I took it that she wasn't interested and just shut up about it, until I got home and was able to vent to some friends.", "\"I'm sorry, the fact that you left work a few times without saying much made it seem like a personal issue and I didn't want to seem nosy.\"\n\nThen ask about her daughter EVERY BREAK lol, kidding don't be a douche like me.\n\nBut NTA.
