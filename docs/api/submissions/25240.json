My team consists of 6 people including me and the co-worker in question. This person and I are not close, we interact strictly professionally and I don't personally like her very much. I do try to treat her with the same respect i treat every co-worker. If it's relevant I'm in my thirties and the co-worker is in her fifties.\n\nSo the current situation is as follows:\n\nLast week she told us she had to leave work early, but didn't specify why. I later heard from another co-worker that it was some kind of problem in her family. She was back the next day and didn't say anything about it to me. I figured it was personal and kept out of it.\n\nYesterday she left work again, this time without telling anyone why except one co-worker. This co-worker later told me it was because her daughter needed to be taken to the emergency room because she had been diagnosed with diabetes.\n\nThis morning the co-worker in question was back. We exchanged the usual pleasantries in the morning and had some interactions related to work but nothing more. At lunch she was fuming, she told me she thought I was callous because I didn't ask about her daughters health. She said she knew the other co-worker told me the situation yesterday so the only reason I didn't ask was because i didn't care.  I told her I didn't want to interfere in her personal life and she stormed off.\n\nSo my thinking is that considering our relationship I thought she would tell me if she wanted me to know about it, or wanted to talk about it. Since she didn't I didn't ask her about her daughter because to me that is interfering in someones private/personal life.\n\nAm I the asshole for not asking her about her daughter?", "created_utc": 1692702560, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15y2lt5/aita_for_not_asking_about_a_coworkers_daughter/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's either using you as an outlet for her stress over her daughter's situation, or she's a terrible communicator.

I say give it a few weeks to cool down, and if she's still rude or the behavior escalates, consider sending an email and cc'ing your supervisor and HR.", "NTA.

If I'm told something by other means I do ask are they OK but wouldn't push it. I went on a mental health course and one thing I learnt was ask someone twice as people usually default to saying yeah I'm OK thanks the first time. So if you are concerned after asking are you ok? You would say are you sure your OK? But I wouldn't do this every greeting just for someone you were concerned about. She is probably just very stressed and lashing out.", "NTA\n\nYour work colleagues not friends. Your not obligated to ask anybody at work about their personal lives.", "NTA unless She tells you about herself and her situation it is none of your business.", "NTA. You don't have a close relationship with her, and keeping it professional by not asking about her personal life is totally acceptable.

She just wanted attention. When my mum died some folks who knew said something or were checking in on me and some folks either didn't feel they were close enough to me to want to mention it to me or didn't know.

There is no reason for her to expect you to be concerned or comment about her child. The project? Yes. Maybe her? But that\u2019s stretching it per how you\u2019ve laid out the story. \n\nIf an apology is needed to get the team dynamics back state something like: As the information about your non-work situation did not come directly from you I figured it best to not comment about it in case you wanted to keep work and personal life separate, as I generally do. I\u2019m sorry if this offended you.", "It depends on the daughter's situation.", ">People like this are\n\ndrama queens, with which you can only lose.
