However, when my mum got pregnant, they got married. The marriage didn't last long and they split before I was 2. He got his next girlfriend (Debbie) pregnant shortly after (they split when she got pregnant) and had my half sister Sarah (24F). My dad did the bare minimum of parenting when I was a kid (had me on weekends, 2 holidays a year, wrote a blank cheque for child support). I moved abroad with my mum and stepdad when I was 12, but as I got older we got closer and he visited once a month. He wasn't a dad per se, more like an uncle.\n\nMy dad had a very different relationship with Sarah. He paid the minimum child support he could get away with, and from what I understand didn't see her much. I only saw her a few times while growing up, and every time she was unbelievably nasty to me. Sarah got married at 20 and had a child. She and her husband harassed my dad via phone and text for the first year of their marriage until he blocked them.\n\nI now live in the UK, in my dad's flat (he lives abroad). A few months ago, Sarah started showing up, demanding I convince my dad and my g.father to give her money because they 'owe her'. I told reception in my building not to let her in again, but now at least twice a week she waits outside my building and badgers me every time I leave. A couple of times she's even brought her husband with her, who is a very unsavoury character, thankfully on those occasions I've always had someone with me. The first time it happened my dad told me to call the police every time she comes, and get a restraining order (called something else in the UK but can't use the word in the post). I was reluctant to do this because legal proceedings could affect her employment and ability to provide for her child as well as mean social workers getting involved etc. and I didn't want that. I thought eventually she would give up but it's been months. My bf only lives with me part time and he's started having someone stay with me when he's not there because he's so worried she'll get into the building.\n\nI've thought about paying, we all have. Whenever she's  been asked what exactly she wants she just throws out insane numbers, which leads me to believe no amount of money would be enough for her to stop. Frankly, I don't think she's owed anything by anyone, especially after terrorising me, but if I thought paying her would make her go away I'd have made sure someone did.\n\nIt's come to a point where I'm under pressure from all sides to start legal proceedings, but I still don't feel right about it. My dad's gf is the only person who can see where I'm coming from, but my bf has said I'm taking a stupid risk with my safety by not doing something about it. I know everyone just wants me to be safe but I'd be ruining Sarah's and possibly her child's life by doing this.
