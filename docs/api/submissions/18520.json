I have an amazing relationship with all of them. And I'm very proud of them. \n\nMy daughter Catherine (24F) is the youngest of her siblings. She's always been extremely smart. She succeded in whatever she tried to do during her entire life, and is now on an excellent path for her future and career. However, her emotional intelligence is a bit behind her other skills.\n\nCatherine started dating a girl (Hailey - 25F) about two years ago. The moment she brought her home, I could tell that Hailey was a materialistic person (unlike Catherine) and was after her own gain. Catherine is very kind and sentimental, she values the deeper sense of belonging and family more than anything else and Hailey was quite the opposite. So I warned Catherine then but she shut me down. I never mentioned it again during the past 2 years.\n\nTurns out, I was right. Catherine came home for a brief visit and said that she had broken up with Hailey because all she could see was material. She was understandably heartbroken. I told her I could see this moment clear as a day the first time I saw Hailey, and that it would hurt less with time.\n\nCatherine told me I was being insensitive by using this moment to tell her I'd told her so. I said it was clear from day one that they wouldn't make it, and I was just saying that Hailey really wasn't her person, and frankly wasn't a good fit for our family either. She acted cold towards me and hasn't called me this week (which is weird because no matter what she calls me once a week)\n\nWas I an AH about this?", "created_utc": 1685398768, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13v8dv1/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_i_told_you_so_about/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You also chose to twist the blade with  \"Hailey really wasn't her person...\" and \"...wasn't a good fit for our family...\"  \n\n\nToo bad your amazing clairvoyance has no element of self-awareness.

The last thing she needs rn is for you to make her feel stupid on top of all the hurt she's probably feeling. You're kind of making it about you and belittling her at the same time, not to mention being paternalistic in the bad way. What does being a \"good fit for the family\" mean? I think you're less of a modern man than you think you are.", "YTA - Now which one lacks emotional intelligence? It's not the time to flaunt yourself.

She'd finished a two year relationship, let her be sad then when she opens up about her ex, you can chime in.", "I'm a Mom of a grown daughter.\n\nI have one question:  what did you have to gain with \"I told you so?\".  At that moment?  What did you earn by telling her that you were right, and she was wrong? \n\nI get what you were trying to do. Hopefully, in the future, she'll listen to your opinions about the people in her life. And maybe you can save her, later, from more heartbreak.\n\nBut you NEVER get there with \"I told you so.\". That makes you the all-seeing, most wise and venerable of crystal ball owners.  And it makes her as dumb as dirt.  She knows how dumb she is because you told her so, and she did it anyway.\n\nMom ... you can be supportive and sensitive, and there will come a day when you can voice an opinion, and it will be respected, but never ever bring this up as an example.  \n\nThe last girlfriend my grown son had ... eh ... I didn't warm up to her.  She wasn't right for him.  My son could tell I wasn't warming up to my usual level with his friends that I DO like.  But I stayed the hell out of it.  But he knew. When he told me that they had broken up, I said \"Good. You okay?\" and absolutely nothing more.  He was okay. He's now with someone I adore, and she's wonderful for him.\n\nSometimes it's all about zipping your lips.  Right now, she thinks she's stupid for what happened.  Your \"I told you so\" just makes her feel even more stupid.  \n\nGood luck. This one is a tough thing to repair.", "YTA.\n\n\"I told you so\" is just a way of rubbing salt into an already painful wound. What did you expect her to say, \"Oh Mother, you're SO smart.

A real one.", "YTA. There\u2019s being right, and there\u2019s being kind. You chose to prioritise being right at a time when your daughter was sad and needed kindness and understanding. Congratulations on \u2018calling it\u2019 accurately. I hope it\u2019s worth the damage you did to your relationship with your daughter.", "YTA. All she wanted was a shoulder to cry on and a sympathetic ear to listen. Her own mother couldn\u2019t be that person for her so now she probably feels all alone.

That is horrible form and your daughter won't forget that you're not a safe person to be vulnerable with. Congratulations on your correct intuition and the destruction of your relationship because you couldn't respect her feelings.", "YTA there was no need to rub salt in her wounds. She found out the hard way, and she's hurting. Shame on you. \n\nIt rarely worksfor a parent to tell their child what's wrong with their partner. Helping them to realize it on their own is a service and a skill. Just asking her questions about the girl in which the responses your daughter gives would reveal the gf's materialistic bent. But telling her puts her on the defensive and might even make her ignore the signs for longer than if you'd said nothing.", "YTA, yes.

It\u2019s snarky and condescending to a kid who is doing what you want them to do. It\u2019s not encouraging or positive. \n\nYou wanted your daughter to end things with this woman. Telling her you saw it from the beginning, implying she did something wrong by not seeing it is just rubbing salt in her wounds. Why are you piling on while she is mourning the end of her relationship & losing someone she has loved (for better or for worse) for the last two years. \n\nAlso, never ever give your opinion on a ex (especially recent ones) unless you are directly asked & even then be noncommittal & diplomatic. Not all break ups last forever & the last thing you want is your kid reconciling with someone you have bad mouthed.", "Yeah, YTA. You\u2019d rather be right than kind. When my fianc\u00e9 cheated on me, my mother went on a tirade about how awful she was and how she always knew she\u2019d be a disaster and how my mother had suffered knowing this all along but unable to say anything because I was too blind and dismissive. You know what I needed? Empathy. I needed space and support to explore my own confused feelings, not hear my mothers righteousness and judgement. It put a lasting dent in our relationship. I share less with her. I trust her less. I suggest you apologise and show true empathy ASAP.", "YTA, while it may have been clear to you, it wasn't clear to your daughter.  She's still hurting and just needs your support. If this was a few years down the road she's healed, she'd probably be ok with this information. But right now, she's still mourning the loss of a partner.", "YTA. Support your child.", "YTA. You were right, but you should have kept your thoughts to yourself. You rubbed it in that you knew better at the wrong time.", "Pity nobody told you in advance that your daughter would be upset, so that they could have the joy of telling you that they told you so.

Meanwhile, YTA.", "YTA. \n\nWhen I was Catherine's age, I dated a woman who turned out to be really emotionally abusive. My best friend had never liked her, and chose right after we broke up and I was really devastated to basically say \"good riddance\" and act like I should already be over it. I was really, really upset by that, and it was really hurtful and only made me feel worse. I felt pushed into defending my ex, which was not a great feeling, and felt like, oh, well, if my friend knew the whole time, how stupid am I for not seeing it? How stupid am I now to still be upset? But you can't just turn your feelings off, so I was still upset, and even more hurt. I can't imagine if my *mom* had acted like that.", "A bit of an AH ... It's hard with kids in general, but especially older ones (mine are 22, 20, 12, 10 and 7) to not say \"I told you so!\" Occasionally it may call for it, but in many things, they have to learn lessons for themselves, or they'll never actually learn. When you were that age, would you want your mother telling you \"I told you so!\"?  I know I didn't. It actually can create resentment towards the one saying it. You could've said something more like, \"I'm sorry this happened to you. I had a feeling and I wish it didn't come to light. I'm here if you need a shoulder to cry on or want to talk.\" Or just leave out the part where you thought it might happen all together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Are you being for real", "YTA - you say *your daughter's* emotional skills are behind other skills? What about yours? What about your kid needing a hug in a time of heartbreak and you choosing this moment to lecture her out of pettiness? \n\nThe comment about her ex not being \"a good fit for our family\" really seals the deal for me. Your kid's partner needs to be a good fit for *them*. You're not part of the equation.", "Yep YTA ..your kids need to be able to learn from their mistakes without you wanting to say: i told you so.", "YTA - You told her so on day one. It was true after two years. There is a two year timespan of a meaningful relationship. And you seem incapable of understanding that.", ">I have an amazing relationship with all of them.\n\nNo, you don't. You have a relationship where you would rather be right that kind. You're the one with zero emotional intelligence. And definitely YTA", "YTA, your victory lap wasn't the point. Its not enough that you were right and your daughter was left heartbroken, you had to remind her of how right you were too?\n\nMay I suggest you call her and show empathy for her situation rather than glee about being right.", "YTA instead of being there to comfort you daughter that you love dearly\u2026 you said well you brought this on yourself I told you so.  Keep doing stuff like that and you daughter will stop confiding her feelings to you.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "of course YTA, in 54 years you've not learned to just shut up and comfort somebody without throwing it in their face..? weird flex but ok", "You should apologize to her. She fell in love with her and you saying that makes it sound like you never approved of that relationship. You just have to be there for her", "YTA - my Mam did exactly the same to me when I broke up with a long term gf. To further add insult to injury, she went on a \"When I was your age, I was married, had a house and kids on the way\". I was looking forward to those things with the ex who just cheated on me.\n\nHonestly don't think I've ever felt lower in my life, really didn't need kicking whilst I was down.\n\nI know OP wasn't as bad as that, but I expect the daughter is feeling much worse with the \"I told you so, instead of sympathy\"", "I personally think there is a time and a place for \"I told you so\", but it's not immediately after a breakup. \n\nAITA so much. Your daughter will never learn the lesson you wanted her to learn because you tried to lord your better judgement over her at the moment she needed hugs and affection, not smartassery.", "YTA.  Saying 'I told you so' is always an AH move. It is so much better to remain silent and supportive, but what you said was neither, just enforcing your own feelings of superiority.  Not a good look, you know?  Apologize and now work on your own emotional intelligence.", "NTA - She\u2019s old enough to know better", "...but it's OP's daughter whose emotional intelligence is lagging behind.\n\nEdit to add /s", "Wait wasn't that Jordy Pete?", "She's 24 years old bruv...", "I don\u2019t know who this is but it\u2019s so simple & makes so much sense. Like we\u2019ve just accepted it\u2019s normal to mock & condescend. This is the link. https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRojkSVA/?t=2"]}
