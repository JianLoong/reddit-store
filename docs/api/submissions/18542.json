{"id": 18542, "submission_id": "13vlsrq", "title": "AITA for screaming at my husband for burning dinner", "selftext": "I cook almost every night for myself and my partner (other than when we get takeaway). I enjoy cooking, and I\u2019m quite good at it, so it isn\u2019t a massive burden. The last couple of weeks have been very hard for me. My uncle was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and my Dad needed emergency surgery, as well as a slew of other big stressors. I think I\u2019m suffering from reactive depression and I cried most of today. \n\nMy partner offered to make dinner because of how I was feeling, so I gave him a recipe which was very straightforward and didn\u2019t need much technique. I\u2019m relaxing on the couch when every fire alarm in the house goes off. So I run to the kitchen and he has a pan of black salmon streaming smoke. I tell him to take it outside and put the pan on the bricks because of the billowing smoke, but he stands there and argues with me saying, \u201cthe salmon is still good\u201d. Eventually I yell at him to go outside with it and he does. Then I run around opening windows and flushing the house with a towel. Eventually we have to get the ladder and remove the smoke alarms to stop them. \n\nI then strip the salmon of the burnt exterior, leaving about 1/3 of the fish edible. And we eat that with the now cold vegetables. I got pretty pissed while I was trying to salvage the dinner and called him incompetent and raised my voice. \n\nI feel like I do so much more mental labour and I can\u2019t trust him to take anything on because shit like this always happens. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weaponised incompetence, just plain old carelessness, I think he really did want to do a good job tonight but he still messed up and left me more stressed out than if I cooked it myself. He thinks I was way out of line and was \u201cscreaming at him for a genuine mistake\u201d. \n\nAm I the asshole for being a bit of a jerk about his mistake? I feel like I probably am, but it also feels weirdly justified to me in the context of our relationship as a whole.\n\n**Edit:** thanks everyone for the input so far. I apologised for yelling because that was uncalled for and an asshole move. He accepted my apology. I mentioned maybe he could start cooking more in general and improve his skills.\nHe said to just ask him to and he will. \n\nI think it\u2019s also clear there is probably more to unpack about our dynamic in general, because I think I have some pent up resentment about the mental load I take on. But we can have that conversation together on a less heated night.\n\n**Edit 2:** Okay, this is a much bigger issue than I originally realised. Thank you to everyone who shared comments about unfair division of labour, mental load etc. I\u2019ve done some reading this morning and it\u2019s pretty clear my partner does weaponise his incompetence and I don\u2019t know how to feel about it. It\u2019s just sucks. I do all the planning and organising for our lives and he does some of the execution, but often needs direction. I\u2019m an exploration geologist and when I\u2019m away in the field, I cook meals before I go and freeze them for him. I always thought of it as an act of service and an expression of love, but I think I\u2019m realising it\u2019s also because I know he can\u2019t feed himself\u2026. And I just don\u2019t know what to do with that information. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m suffering from chronic overwhelm and the emotional distress of the last few weeks has been a breaking point. I\u2019m just not sure how to navigate this and improve our relationship. Because again, I think that will fall on me. I\u2019ve been looking into couples counselling this morning", "created_utc": 1685439994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vlsrq/aita_for_screaming_at_my_husband_for_burning/", "score": 631, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On its face seems like your partner offered to help because you were having a rough time (seems like a positive) then burned the meal (sucks but happens to the best of us) and then y\u2019all disagreed about next steps (also not atypical). So in a good light your partner had good intentions but an unfortunate series of events followed. But if your partner is typically lazy, incompetent, self-centered, basically always making your life harder than it has to be, then that\u2019s a different story. NTA in the latter scenario.", "NTA\n\nLook you were clearly at the end the end of your rope and what you needed was him to handle this one thing, just one thing, and that was too much. And yes, maybe the salmon wasn\u2019t the easiest, but it\u2019s not about the salmon is it (shades of Iranian yoghurt!).\n\nBecause what you needed was for him to take a look at the salmon, realise he couldn\u2019t cope, and order takeout. \n\nI get what you\u2019re saying about the emotional labor and that\u2019s the issue which needs to be tackled.", "NTA.\nGenuine mistakes can happen, of course. But it's the way he's handling it. If he would have taken the responsibility and solved this (open the windows, stripping the fish of burnt parts etc) it would be different. But he did not manage to solve those things on his own but made you take care of it when he knew you needed rest", "\n\nNo, you are not the asshole. It is understandable that you were upset given the mental and emotional stress you have been under as of late. It is also understandable that you felt very frustrated by your husband's lack of understanding of the situation. While you may have been a bit \"jerky\" in your attempt to explain the situation to your husband, it does not make you an asshole. Your reaction was understandable given the situation and therefore you are not at fault.", "NTA\n\n>I mentioned maybe he could start cooking more in general and improve his skills. He said to just ask him to and he will. \n\nI think you might still have a problem. I mean, you did ask and now you need to ask again? You told him you need him to take some of the mental load and he can cook more to get better and he says you just need to ask??? His response should have been, \"that's a great idea, how's about I take 2 nights a week to start?\" So now, the mental load is still on you to ask him to step up...again.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry that you have a lot going on, but it\u2019s not an excuse to treat your partner poorly. Just like it wouldn\u2019t be acceptable to slap them because they made you angry. \n\nIf you knew he wasn\u2019t going to be able to make dinner without issue, you should have had him order takeout. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised when he stops offering to help you. I know I wouldn\u2019t help someone who screams at me for something I\u2019m not very good at. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t stay with someone who did.", "YTA and find better ways of coping with stress. Other human beings are not punchbags for your misery, talk to your people with respect, no matter the situation.", "ESH/ YTA. Yes, he should have been quicker about getting the burning fish out. But telling someone to cook fish, when they aren't normally the cook, was already a risky move. You sound like you're trying to find a reason to be pissed at him, and he didn't really do anything wrong. This is not how to process your emotions.", "Soft YTA. Lots going on and it sounds like bearing a lot of the burden at best of times.\n\nEven if you do most of the cooking through your partner should be motivated enough to learn 3/4 recipes that they can do when you are tired/ill. Fish probably not the best place to start to be honest.", "YTA\n\nHe was trying his best and even though it didn't work out, you took your stress out on him.

Sounds like you're not happy in this relationship.", "YTA\n\nPan seared salmon as a 'very straightforward and didn\u2019t need much technique' recipe for someone who doesn't cook much?\n\nI'm a very good cook and don't like to make pan seared salmon because of how finicky it is. Baked is super easy, I've even taught tweens and teens to make baked salmon in the toaster oven. \n\nYou're stressed from everything else going on in your life. Perhaps stick to takeaway on nights your partner is responsible for meals for now. \n\nOnce things calm down, kindly bring your partner into the kitchen and start cooking together. Make it an enjoyable activity, build confidence!", "ESH, unless the fish was meant to be blackened, he just want paying attention.  Screaming really doesn\u2019t help anyone.  This sounds like a final straw that broke the camels back kind of issue.  Take a few steps back and weigh the pros and cons of your relationship, you don\u2019t sound happy.", "ESH. Yes, you shouldn't have yelled. However: from what you are saying about his behavior in your post and your comments, his behavior *does* sound like learned/weaponized incompetence.\n\nGetting therapy for your mental health could be very helpful for you right now. \n\nEvaluating your relationship should be helpful, too. If you really do carry most of the mental load and he isn't pulling his weight, things need to change or you will stay unhappy.", "Very soft YTA, he was trying to help, and I feel like you're projecting all your frustration and anger about how things are going at the moment on to him because there really isn't anyone else to blame and having someone to blame makes it easier.", "Soft YTA, I think that it wasn't your husband's intention to burn dinner, since the effort to present you with a meal is clearly there so your anger in him is misplaced. However, I think that you are clearly beyond stressed out, and slip-ups happen. We're only human. Just make sure your husband knows that you were at the end of your rope, and apologize for the yelling.", "He\u2019s probably terrified of fucking up because he is afraid of your reaction leading him to be under so much stress that in the end he fucks it up. Chill out and let him just get on with it and stop being a control freak. YTA", "YTA\n\nYou were a jerk. You need to see a therapist to learn how to manage your anger and express it in a responsible way.", "YTA. He made a mistake. Humans make mistakes. You make mistakes. Be kind", "Yeah YTA soft one (as you are in a fragile moment).\nI also do all the cooking at home. It\u2019s my hobby, I did bunch of cooking classes, I come from a family that cooks a storm. It really relax me after work. My husband doesn\u2019t. And while he cooked at the beginning of our relationship after many years of me me me he just regresses at a preteen level of cooking. (He does the cleaning after while I park my butt on the couch). \nWhen, for whatever reason, I can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to cook my husband does eggs, pasta (sauce from my freezer collection, sandwiches) or simply orders. I don\u2019t expect much at all. \nYou give your husband a recipe you think was easy but probably it wasn\u2019t for his cooking level. He tried. He failed. It happens. I also burned sometime things. Screaming and calling him incompetent for his mistake was uncalled for, sorry.", "YTA accidents happen.\n\nYou're going through a lot right now and you may, subconsciously, be directing all your hurt, frustration and anger at your husband.\n\nBe kind to him. He's trying and you will need to lean on each other a lot over the next few weeks and months.", "YTA, personally I think if you get to the point where you're screaming at a partner you're always going to be TA. I also think you suspect that already, your first paragraph reads lile excuses. Sounds like you're having a tough time and your partner might well be a buffoon but clearly they were trying to do something nice so it ending in screaming at them does feel a bit out of order.", "Soft YTA if he was honestly trying and just made a mistake. Shouting and calling him incompetent is unnecessarily mean. But it is a soft YTA because you have a lot of unhappy things going on in your life at the moment, so it is understandable that a fish fire in the kitchen could have just felt like the last straw to send you spiraling over the line. I would apologize for the shouting and mean words though, and maybe go have a nice dinner together.", "YTA, mistakes happen in the kitchen for all of us. The timimg wasn't the greatest but mistakes happen. Your over reaction makes me think there's more going on.", "YTA here. Obviously. I also wonder how much of his supposed incompetence is more about you refusing to let go of control. How do you perform when someone is standing over you ready to criticize or take over?\n\nDon't tell him what to cook. Let him choose his own recipes to shop for and try. Don't tell him how to do things. Together make a list of things that need to be done and divide them up then leave him alone to accomplish his tasks. \n\nYou want him to be a partner, stop acting like a parent.", "YTA. \n\nBut stress makes assholes of us all.  \n\nA guy who rarely cooks fucked up, and you overreacted - simple as that.", "Am the main cook in our house and I'm pretty good, yesterday I totally ruined a frypan, non-stick and whole house full of smoke.\nEveryone fucks up sometimes and hopefully your partner is there when you do, karma is real. YTA.", "YTA.", "Your edit makes me cringe.\n\nYou shouldn't have to \"ask\". He's not your child, he's an adult and he needs to take initiative, not wait for mommy to tell him what to do.", "Soft YTA but only for the choice of food. Pan seared fish is notoriously hard to cook for novices. It would be like asking someone to saut\u00e9 food then getting angry they messed it up.\n\nThat being said I know someone who is serially incompetent so can be sort of forgiven when it happens for the x^(th) time.", "YTA\n\nHe screwed up and let you down, but screaming at him is not an appropriate or acceptable response. \n\nYou said yourself it was a genuine mistake, and it's not as if you couldn't have just thrown it out and order food in. It barely even needed to be an issue.\n\nIn short he was careless but you were _nasty_.\n\nFrankly if my partner screamed at me for burning a bit of fish I'd pack my bags.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but if the genders were reversed and a guy blew his lid and screamed at his partner and called her incompetent for burning dinner - everyone would be all over him. Because that\u2019s verbal abuse. That\u2019s absolutely not okay. Ever. No matter what the circumstances are. \n\nIf you\u2019re frustrated with the mental load you take on, seek couples counseling or get a divorce.

Should she have not believed him and taken over because she knew he couldn't do it? \n\nAlso, as a partner, he shouldn't be \"offering to help\".

But I still feel it\u2019s not my responsibility to know his level of cooking ability, he assured me he could cook the salmon and I took him on his word. I think it\u2019s a crappy situation if we have to get takeout anytime I can\u2019t cook, so obviously we both need to work on a solution and him improving his skills", "Thanks, I agree with this sentiment. I probably need to employ some extra coping skills right now because my emotional regulation is much shakier than usual", "But he said he could handle it. Why should she have not believed him?", "I think I can see fish was a silly thing to ask him to do now. It was just the only thing in the fridge and he said he could do it no problem.

I\u2019m going to ask him to find some easy recipes he likes the sound of and start cooking more in general, and I can give him some pointers. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s great that only one of us can do a basic and essential life skill like cook dinner", "I\u2019m not happy in general right this minute. But I do think I\u2019m not happy in the relationship as a whole. A few years ago him burning salmon would have been a funny moment, but today it made me want to cry from stress. I think it probably is a wake-up call that I need to think about the relationship more seriously", "This is literally the first time I\u2019ve ever been angry at him for a mistake. A one off occurrence. So I wholeheartedly disagree with this take!", "I agree I should have just cooked dinner myself seeing as salmon was all we had. He thought he would be fine, I did ask him if he thought he could handle it. Yelling was uncalled for though, I should have cooled down and then had an adult conversation about things", "I just want to clarify I didn\u2019t berate him. I yelled one sentence and it was, \u201cgoddamnit you are so incompetent sometimes!\u201d. Which was a mean thing to say, but I didn\u2019t try to intimidate, or humiliate him. I wrote \u201cscreamed\u201d in the title because that is what he said. He said I screamed at him for a simple mistake, and I wanted him to have his voice heard in the post. I actually disagree with his take, I don\u2019t feel I was screaming and he also yelled at me while we were trying to fix the fire alarms. Was it okay, no! But I genuinely don\u2019t think what either of us said or did this evening constitutes any kind of abuse", "I completely get you, it shouldn't be your responsibility to evaluate his level of skill in doing something, he's a grown man and should be able to tell by himself. Having to actively consider whether he can do it or not and having to keep an eye on whether he burns the place down is what the mental load is about and it's absolutely exhausting, even more so when you're already mentally drained.", "Yeah, maybe a little less yelling would have been good but at some point, being with a partner who is pretty incompetent at a lot of life (partly because you are so competent, he can just skate by) is so frustrating and crazy making, I'm sure it can drive you to tears. But also, has he no self-respect? This is a character flaw. The mental weight of it all, esp when you have your dad to worry about sounds crushing.  Good plan to talk about all this when emotions aren't running high and see if you can find a path forward. Essential especially if you plan on having children. I hope your dad recovers well. NTA", "Something to think about is if a grown-ass person can\u2019t handle basic tasks like cooking a meal, then I\u2019d wonder how they\u2019d handle life when it throws something even more serious your way (e.g., *you* being the one with a serious diagnosis). On its own, burning dinner is NBD but you\u2019ve mentioned a pattern. I don\u2019t know about a partner who is generally incompetent, if that\u2019s what the situation is.", "The only way he's going to get more confident is to get experience and make mistakes, but getting yelled at for those mistakes will be counterproductive.", "Wow. You make him sound mentally challenged. Maybe you aren't a good fit. Your expectations seem to outweigh his competency. By the way you describe him, I am surprised he can tie his shoes.", "> I mentioned maybe he could start cooking more in general and improve his skills. He said to just ask him to and he will.\n\nDid you explain that you are, in fact, asking him?  Right now?", "Gender is relevant here.  If a man screamed at a woman for burning dinner, that guy wouldn't have survived AITA's wrath.  But it was a woman screaming at a man so we have to bend over backwards to find a way to make her NTA.", "I think you need to continue the conversation. He needs to eat, right? Why should it be on anyone else to continually plan and execute his meals? And why should someone need to tell him to figure something out occasionally? He's in a partnership, right? \n\nSteps are still steps but he needs to take bigger steps. Good luck!", "You definitely need to have a deeper conversation about all the things you're carrying. If you haven't heard of it, you might want to check out Fair Play. It's a system designed to help couples balance out tasks and mental load equitably. Or write out everything you carry the mental load for and decide together who will take responsibility for each thing - whole responsibility. Then revisit those assignments as necessary; it's a continuing conversation.", "Thanks! I appreciate this. I do feel like I do a huge amount of mental labour and have to assign him tasks to complete, and also know what tasks he can and cannot do. It\u2019s frankly really exhausting, and doesn\u2019t feel like an equal partnership, which I think is why I flipped out tonight. Still not an okay thing to do, but that\u2019s what I meant by \u201cin the context of our relationship\u201d", "She said herself that she doesn\u2019t trust him to take care of things, so there\u2019s obviously a track record of things like this happening. \n\nWhen he offered to make dinner, she should have told him to figure out what to make. Instead she gave him a recipe to follow. OP has to give up some control in order to not carry the weight of all the emotional labor.", "Be good to yourself so you can be good to others. I don\u2019t think any of us are above frustration but I know you don\u2019t want to lose the person you love, it\u2019s happened to me.", "And if he can't cook fish, why didn't he say so? Why does it fall on her to actively consider whether he can do it? He has a mouth, he can use to say he's not confident with the recipe", "True - he could have taken one look at her, realised that she isn\u2019t up to a cooking disaster, and suggested delivery.", "It's not your responsibility to do that. It's actually his. He's not a child. He should know what he can and cannot do.", "He is also an idiot in this situation and needs to learn some recipes", "I\u2019m kind of bemused about the comments saying cooking fish is somehow a super advanced skill. A lot of the time you can just cover it in foil or paper and shove it in the oven for the correct amount of time and it comes out good. What I think might be the issue is that he doesn\u2019t cook enough to know the peculiarities of the oven/hob, and he might not have realised that cooking stuff for the first time requires pretty much constant attention. Then again, I have been cooking since I was a teenager (yay parentification) so there\u2019s probably a bunch of knowledge you get from that which we just don\u2019t think about. It\u2019s exhausting having to teach an adult to cook, I\u2019ve had to do it more times than I would like (housemates, not partners- I\u2019ve always somehow found partners who are excellent cooks).

His attempts at cooking alone often resulted in spoiled food.

He also does most of the cooking because I can\u2019t stand cooking, but I do still do it a handful of times a week for various meals.\n\nI do more of the cleaning: dusting, laundry, vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom, washing up, etc. I\u2019m also the financial planner. I work less hours than him in my job so I don\u2019t mind it.\n\nHe mows the lawn and takes the rubbish out too, lol.", "Ah yep, I\u2019m coming to that realisation now. And feeling like a bit of an idiot for taking 7 years to realise maybe this is an actual problem"]}
