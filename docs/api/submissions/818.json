They decided to give the child up for adoption. A girl. Later on, we meet, get married, and I have three kids that are now 15, 14, and 9. In 2015 my husband passed away in a very traumatic way and I have been a single mother ever since. His side of the family and I are still close and we keep in touch, take trips together, etc. My SIL had done one of those DNA tests and I guess the daughter my husband gave up for adoption did one as well and reached out to my SIL to try to get in contact with her birth father. Obviously, that\u2019s not possible since he\u2019s no longer alive, but my SIL told her about me and my kids so she wants to meet her biological siblings. The thing is, that I don\u2019t want to do this. I never told my kids about her (honestly I just never really even thought about it until it came up and I remembered he told me) and I do not want to complicate my kids or my own lives with meeting somebody who could potentially want the meeting to become a relationship. My children were also very young when my husband died with my youngest two having pretty much no memories of him and my oldest very few and we have spent many years moving on with our lives (yes I know that sounds horrible). My SIL is not going to give our contact information to the girl without my consent of course, but I do feel bad. My SIL also told me that she had found her biological mother but that she didn\u2019t want anything to do with her so I feel doubly bad.

But, as an adopted child, I think your children deserve the choice. There may very well come a time when your children do their own DNA test and find this sister and reach out. They may not be happy to find out they could have had a relationship with her before then but you stopped the contact. Honestly, I have seen some families really struggle because an adult made a decision to keep information from a child and when the child learns of that decision it causes huge problems. The reality is this girl knows of their existence  I guarantee at some point in the future your children will learn of hers and I hope that they feel as though you have them the information and respect to make their own decisions regarding her. Also, she did not know your husband. Meeting this girl won\u2019t stop your children from healing nor will it sully any memories they do have. Also consider that this girl may reach out to others in his family. The more people that know of her existence the greater the chance this secret is no longer a secret and quickly. Please tell your children in age appropriate manner that this girl exists. Even if you tell them that you want to wait until they are all teenagers before reaching out. They deserve to hear this from you", "YTA\n\nYour children, especially your 15-year-old, should get to make this decision for themselves. This child may be nothing to you, but she is their biological sister and you would be wrong not to let them decide (with the help of a neutral therapist) if and/or when they want to meet her.", "NTA. \n\nBut are you sure, that you want your kids one day to find out, that they have a sister and you know? This isn't going away and you might have some explaining to do, because in the end they do deserve to know.", "I\u2019m leaning NAH for the moment, because I understand this is a big change and it\u2019s tough to figure out what the best thing to do is. However, I would gently encourage you to consider getting a message to the bio daughter that you need time to consider it. I also think you should explain the situation to your children (at least the older ones) about her and leave the decision up to them. I think finding out about her years from now and learning that you\u2019d kept that kind of information from them might cause problems.", "NAH\n\nMaybe send the girl a letter and let her know that her siblings are still young and still dealing with the trauma of losing their father...and that you don't think now is a good time to introduce her to them\n\nBut...you could also connect with this girl on your own, showing her photos and talking to her about her father\n\nIf that is something you feel comfortable doing, maybe it would be good for both of you", "YTA - All I could read in this post was \"I, me, my, etc.\"\n\nYour kids are entitled to make their own choice of if they want to meet their BIOLOGICAL half sibling. \n\nYou are making this all about you, when really, you are least important opinion here.", "It\u2019s complicated, for sure. \n\nI had a half sister I didn\u2019t know about until *she died*\n\n my dad kept her a secret.\n\nI was very hurt I never got to meet or know about her until after she passed, apparently she was wonderful, warm, and a lot like me (interests, love of Halloween and costumes) \n\nIt hurts when people make choices for you.", "Nobody Wins in this Scenario.\n\nNTA.

However, your children might want a relationship with her when they are older.\n\nMy suggestion...\n\nLeave the door open by explaining that your children are too young. Get her contact information, and tell her it will be their decision when they are adults.", "NAH. The girl isn't doing anything wrong by asking to meet her biological family. You're not doing anything wrong by pausing to consider how introducing a half-sibling to your kids will affect them, especially as they recover from the trauma of losing their father. \n\nBut...you don't know anything about this girl, so it may be best to connect with her yourself before making a decision. A lot of other commenters have pointed out that in a few years your kids will be old enough to connect with her on their own and they may resent you for not allowing them to connect. You also can't control whether other members of your late husband's family will choose to connect with this girl. If they do, how will you handle holidays and other family events if they choose to include her?", "NAH - it\u2019s normal for her to reach out but you\u2019re not obligated to potentially radically alter your kids\u2019 lives just because she reached out. So far you know nothing about this woman so maybe do your due diligence first. For some reason everyone is assuming she\u2019s automatically a wonderful person. Maybe, but maybe not. I also think people are really overstating how pissed your kids would be if they \u201cfound out later\u201d. You have no idea how they will react. They may very well want nothing to do with her, or they may have differing feelings among themselves. \n\nYour job is to provide a stable, loving environment for YOUR children. It\u2019s not your job to introduce a potentially unstable element to their lives just because your late husband was once an accidental sperm donor. Take your time.", "NTA you don\u2019t owe this girl anything.

I get agitated every time she \u201creminds\u201d me to talk to them. I suggest a sit down chat with your kids to feel them out. Let them decide when or if they want to meet her.", "NAH right now but you do need to take some action. \n\n1) contact the girl and have a conversation, ask her what she's looking for. Would she like to know some things about her bio dad, to know the siblings. Be careful and kind with your words. Ie dont say you had forgotten she even existed, instead say you imagined her living the life bio dad wanted for her (insert anything her that he said, good parents, happy, healthy etc)and wanted only good things for her. That in grieving your husband and supporting your kids you hadn't had the opportunity to consider mentioning that their father had a biodaughter that had been adopted. You didn't know whether she would ever get in contact and some of your kids are still quite young. \n\n2)next if she is willing meet with her 1 on 1 and get an understanding of her and what she want. Does she seem like an okay person to be around the kids - mentally stable, not on drugs etc. Have some general chit chat learn about her life. Tell her about bio dad. Find out more about what her expectations are.\nTell her you havent told the kids yet, but you'll find some time in the upcoming week to tell them and discuss their option. Tell her that if the kids are interested in meeting her, your willing to arrange something low key. Also tell her that there will be boundaries that she needs respect(as you andbthe kids will respect hers) and that because the kids are all minors, for now and until you say otherwise all contact goes through you.\n\n3)have a conversation with your kids (maybe with the older 2  first and then a second conversation with the 9 year old) simply informing them that the have a half bio sibling who was adopted. They have made contact and you have spoken to them and met them. They seem nice. Tell them that you would like their thoughts about the situation. Give them a few days before asking/confirming if they want to meet her.\n\n4)you could neet her just your self a couple more times if that feels appropriate, first. if they do want to meet her, let her know. Confirm any boundaries and make arrangements. \n\nI know this seems like a lot, but don't jump the gun. She might not want much of anything other than to introduce herself and a card at christmas. Or you might find she becomes a welcome part of the extended family. Yes it could go badly but don't assume that off the bat or it will.", "Your kids and their sister need to be shown how to make this not weird\u2014a lot of weird decisions were made by adults in their lives and you can be the adult that stops all the weirdness. Send an email, suggest a coffee and a chat, talk about it, be compassionate to all involved, demonstrate to your children how to navigate complex situations with generosity and kindness. Let people have relationships with their bio-siblings. The days of all this forced secrecy should go. Yes, you would be the arsehole if you continued the trend of being the adult who tries to manage what connections people who are related can/can\u2019t have. Denormalise that.", "A Gentle YWBTA.\n\nI only discovered I had a half-brother when was in my 50s. My father kept this hidden most of my life and our relationship has suffered significantly since discovering my brother. \n\nMy father hid this from me because he had an affair -- your situation is a lot less fraught, and I fear your children will have a hard time forgiving you if you make this decision unilaterally. \n\nNow that she has reached out, it is now the time to let your children know that they have a half-sister and let them decide what to do.\n\nI will tell you, that my half-brother and his family have brought a new dimension of joy to my life, if that helps with your decision.", "I understand this may be really hard a far as a dynamic you don't need in your life right now. Another unwelcome change.\n\nHowever, I also think your children may someday wish you hadn't shut the door on the opportunity to know a blood relative their age - especially one who longs to know them. \n\nThey may feel connected to her, and resent you for keeping them apart.\n\nNo need to have her over for Christmas or anything, but maybe consider a couple of different options. Write her and let her know the circumstances, and ask her to wait until the children are a bit older to meet. Or meet her and see if she's someone you'd like to introduce the kids to at a certain point.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss. \n\nNAH", "I want to say NTA, but with some soft ah undertones. I can understand your concern about letting your kids meet her, but the bottom line is that your children have a biological sibling. If your children find out later that not only she exists but that you kept it from them, it could blow up in your face despite your good intentions. . \n\nIf I were in your situation, I would contact the daughter yourself and just be honest with her. She\u2019s (I\u2019m assuming) an adult and if she has any sort of good head on her shoulders, she would understand why you are so hesitant about her meeting your kids. You can make it clear that you definitely don\u2019t want any sort of mother/daughter relationship with her - but you aren\u2019t against getting to know her as a person (and maybe even a friend).\n\nIf you are open to it, why don\u2019t you try to get to know her better on a \u201csocial media\u201d basis?  If she\u2019s active on social media, you can be her friend online/follow her profiles, and just kind of observe her as anyone else that you might have met online. If she turns out to be someone you genuinely like as a person, you might be more open to letting her meet your kids. Obviously, don\u2019t be sneaky about it. Set that as a boundary with her. If she wants to meet you and your kids and possibly have somewhat of a relationship you guys, you need to get to know her first and not just in a \u201chey let\u2019s have coffee and you can tell me everything about yourself that you can cram in an hour.\u201d\n\nIf you aren\u2019t willing to get to know her at all, I would still urge that you tell your older two (and your younger one in time) that they have a half sister and what little you know about her, but that you don\u2019t know her well enough to be comfortable just letting her walk into your lives. That way you have laid a small bit of groundwork if they decide to seek her out later. \n\nGood luck.", "Really the only ones that can answer this question, is your kids. Because this info, as explosive as it is, inevitably belongs to them. Whether they know it or not, it is part of their lives.  They have a sister out there.  \n\nThey may want to know. They may hate knowing. I would be concerned how they may feel about me, for withholding the information. Would it hurt our relationship by not telling them?\n\nI hate secrets. In my experience, secrets destroy. And the longer they fester the worse they get. Could you test the water with your oldest?\n\nUltimately, if you don't tell them, can you control the future and keep the 1/2 sister from telling them? Can you control how they may feel about you, and your decision to withhold this information?", "You\u2019re whole situation sucks.  You should definitely talk to your kids about their sister.  At some point in their lives they will find out and be resentful for not being told earlier.  You\u2019re right to protect your kids.  Have you thought about meeting the daughter alone?  She probably has a ton of questions about your husband and your the best person to answer.  Let your children decide when they are old enough if they want a relationship because at some point I. Won\u2019t be your decision.", "YTA - This girl exists. She didn't ask to be born. She's also lost her father. I get that this is incredibly difficult for you and your feelings are valid. That doesn't make your reaction reasonable though. You have an opportunity to have a very positive and powerful impact. Just remember the good you could do with this whole situation. Hang in there, OP.", "I didn\u2019t know my little half-brother was given up for adoption until I was 16. Our mom died when I was 7. When he turned 18, I was 20 and he finally reached out to me against his adoptive parents\u2019 wishes. We have an awesome relationship even though he never got to meet our mom. I regret the years I lost of not knowing him since my grandparents kept me in the dark.\n\nYTA - for the sake of your kids and her, give them the opportunity to know each other", "It\u2019s not like your husband cheated on you. This child was before you and no matter what you want to think is still his child, you can\u2019t change that. \nYou\u2019re making this way to complicated in your head. The explanation is actually very easy.\n\nYTA for keeping this secret from then when there\u2019s really nothing bad about it.

She may just want to know who he was and some details about him.", "I think hiding her existence now that you know she\u2019s out there and wants to connect has the potential to blow up in your face. What happens when your kid turns 18 or does a DNA test or a family member lets it slip? I honestly think you are better off being the one to tell them and allowing them to make the choice for themselves. They don\u2019t need to choose now but having the knowledge gives them the power. As I see it, the alternative is they\u2019re potentially blindsided by her existence in the future, and if I were the kid in that situation, I think I\u2019d feel suspicious and resentful of anyone who kept that knowledge from me.", "NTA, do what\u2019s best for you and your children.", "I found my bio dad on ancestry, my bio mom wants nothing to do with me.   I\u2019m 54, and my half sibs are in their late 30s early 40s.  He doesn\u2019t want to tell them about me because he\u2019s ashamed as a catholic man that he had a child out of wedlock, long before he married their mom.   I can say a soft YTA, give your children the opportunity to make a decision about contact.   Like other commenters have said, this doesn\u2019t have to be done today but eventually they\u2019ll find out about her, and maybe they are as curious about her as she is about them.   Please don\u2019t feel threatened by her, she won\u2019t take away your family, but may add to it", "I think the more the merrier, and don't forget children have no control how they are conceived. Why not welcome another child/sibling? It isn't like he cheated on you this happened before you even knew him. YTA.", "N A H. I can see both sides. Yes it would be nice if she could meet her half siblings but on the other hand you know nothing about her, her life or her family. I would say if you decide to do it take your time and tread lightly.", "Nah.  I think that you should approach it as, when they are a little older let them make the choice.  Because they should get one.  The youngest being 9 I would wait a little longer.", "Nta tbh she\u2019s just some girl, she was given up for adoption and she has no relation with your husband/her father and he gave up for adoption for a reason", "I don\u2019t understand these YTAs. She\u2019s protecting her children from some random stranger who wants into their lives just because she shares their DNA!!! Adoptee could be anyone with any kind of background or issues or whatever. Proceeding with caution to protect her kids is OPs number one priority and always will be!!\n\nOP Since Sister-In-Law let the cat out of the bag without ASKING YOU FIRST, like she should have, if she could even tell adopted bio daughter about you and your minor children basically you\u2019re stuck with the weight of this decision on you now. \n\nAdoptee Bio daughter may have half your husband\u2019s DNA but she\u2019s still a total stranger. She could just as easily be completely wonderful as a weirdo as totally awful as just meh. You have no idea who she is and should feel totally justified in proceeding with extreme caution. \n\nMy advice would be for you to meet her first, and 100% check her out, background check etc even if you want. Feel totally comfortable protecting your children and keep Bio-sibling out of the picture until you\u2019re sure you want this person in their/your lives!  If Bio-Sibling is any kind of reasonable person she\u2019ll respect that you\u2019re protecting your kids. Even if it means your kids don\u2019t meet her until adulthood or whatever you feel is appropriate to keep them safe and healthy. \n\nAnd yes, OP can do this from a place of kindness and respect for Adoptee\u2019s feelings, but again OP\u2019s first priority always should be her kids safety and mental health. If I found something like this out I would be cautiously optimistic but also highly protective. That\u2019s a mom\u2019s job..\n\nNTA!", "NAH but I would make plans to tell them sooner rather than later. They WILL eventually find out. It\u2019s better to hear it from you with proper context. You do not have to invite her into your lives. You absolutely should tell your kids now about their sibling.", "NAH.  I think you need to really step back and look at this from all angles.  Consider the girl's feelings.  She has found a link to where she came from and people who are biologically connected to her.  Consider the feelings of your children.  If you choose not to even tell them and they find out later, they will probably come to resent you for hiding it from them.  This is not an easy one to figure out, but you need to consider everything before making a final decision.", "NTA-this really should have been your husband facilitating all this but not possible due to his passing. She is most likely looking for answers and you and your kids are not able to provide this. \n\nI think it would be best to reach out to a family therapist to get their take and to help you provide the information to each child in an age appropriate way.  I would also provide therapy sessions individual to each child and allow them to take the\nLead of what if any relationship they want.\n\nI know most people say YTA for not letting them meet but you don\u2019t know your kids mindset and the adoptee. We also do not know what her intentions are -what kind of relationship and what does it entail. These kids are minors- OP is going to have to take time out and plan accordingly and attend all meeting and interactions with a stranger. She and her children does not know this person at all- relationships take time to build and there\u2019s trauma in all levels here. Does she have questions? Will she get frustrated not getting answers? Will she take it out on children especially the impact on a NINE year old? Is she looking for emotional support? -these kids are not emotional support animals.\n\n Honestly, why isn\u2019t her aunt building a relationship and answering questions?That way an adult can gauge her and see if she is ready to meet these kids while you go to therapist to get them ready if they want a relationship.

She could be a really toxic person or she could be a sweetheart..but you should get to know her before you decide to introduce her to your children.\nI feel bad that her BM didn't want to be in contact but your first priority is to protect your children. They are still at a vulnerable age.", "This is a tough one, but YTA to at least the 14 and 15 year old, I\u2019m on the fence with the 9 year old. All of your kids lost their dad and this is another connection they can have to him, it\u2019s not really up to you to deny them that, especially before you\u2019ve even met her. The youngest may not be able to make a decision like that yet, but you could at least meet with her or have a phone call and see if she\u2019s okay. If she\u2019s a drug addict or something, you have a case for continuing to keep this secret. If she\u2019s not, you don\u2019t really have a good reason to deny your two oldest the opportunity to decide for themselves. \n\nI would not let her speak to any of the kids without you there for a while, and I wouldn\u2019t allow her to contact them on her own, but you should speak to them and offer them the truth and the chance to meet her with precautions in place.

I'm sorry for your loss", "Yes YTA. She is still their SISTER.How will they feel years from now or decades from now when they find out AND then find out you hid it from them for so long.

Being jealous of a partners past never does any good.", "YTA. It will come back and bite you in the bum if you don't tell them about her now. It's only a matter of time before one of them does a test and they are linked to her, she will then tell them she reached out and you will, quite rightly, be the bad guy. Real life is messy and complicated, much better to lean in and find a positive way forward than attempt to hide from it. IMHO.", "YTA for your attitude about why you dont want to do anything. And beware, this will come back to bite you and you will lose one if not more of your children. My cousin had a half sister he never knew of.

They decided to give the child up for adoption. A girl. Later on, we meet, get married, and I have three kids that are now 15, 14, and 9. In 2015 my husband passed away in a very traumatic way and I have been a single mother ever since. His side of the family and I are still close and we keep in touch, take trips together, etc. My SIL had done one of those DNA tests and I guess the daughter my husband gave up for adoption did one as well and reached out to my SIL to try to get in contact with her birth father. Obviously, that\u2019s not possible since he\u2019s no longer alive, but my SIL told her about me and my kids so she wants to meet her biological siblings. The thing is, that I don\u2019t want to do this. I never told my kids about her (honestly I just never really even thought about it until it came up and I remembered he told me) and I do not want to complicate my kids or my own lives with meeting somebody who could potentially want the meeting to become a relationship. My children were also very young when my husband died with my youngest two having pretty much no memories of him and my oldest very few and we have spent many years moving on with our lives (yes I know that sounds horrible). My SIL is not going to give our contact information to the girl without my consent of course, but I do feel bad. My SIL also told me that she had found her biological mother but that she didn\u2019t want anything to do with her so I feel doubly bad.

Now she gets invited to all the family gatherings and they are all much happier for it.\n\nIn contrast, my partner doesn't know who their bio dad is & is no-contact with their mom, and I've seen firsthand how that can really mess someone up. They don't know half their family, so they can't learn anything about their heritage or who they're related to.

I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.", "Well I worked in a office where we  dealt with people issues and I can tell this the movies are wrong. You find you bio family, but they can reject you without a second thought, friend zone you are merely send you holiday, they have passed already or they give you one meeting for answers than cut you off. I mean it stinks but Reddit and adopted need to realize that the happy is Hollywood script not really common in the real world.", "r/unexpectedstarwars FTW!!!\n\nAgreed though I'm gonna still say NAH in my opinion because this is a shocker and takes thought and discussion. This would be a huge change to her children's lives and deserves major thought, but OP, your Oldest should get a vote and the neutral therapist or at least neutral ground is a good idea.", "Yeah, I think the key here is to let your kids decide.\n\nAnd don't force them all to decide the same way.  Maybe only one of them is interested?  If so, don't pressure the others.\n\nBut remember: some day, they're likely to do DNA tests themselves.  It's *not* going to stay secret forever.  It's just a matter of figuring out *how* and *when* they find out.", "I like that you're thinking it through, though.\n\nI've heard all kinds of reunion stories, from the ones where everyone becomes one big happy family to the ones where one party wants WAY more of a relationship than the others and it makes it uncomfortable for everyone.\n\nDefinitely you will need to help them navigate the situation, figure out their comfort zone + boundaries, and help them enforce those if necessary. It's not going to be easy. But just because it isn't easy doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.", "That\u2019s awful.  Unfortunately her being pushy or a leech Is possible.  But it\u2019s more likely that, like many adopted kids she just wants to know her bio family. \n\nIt\u2019s worth thinking about.  And maybe talking to a therapist about.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth setting some ground rules for interacting with your kids.\n\nBut really, don\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater.", "Please believe it's best to tell them about her now then later.  If they find out by someone else or DNA test and you didn't tell them you already knew it's going to be a problem.  I have three half siblings that my parents told me about when I was about 11 years old.  They're older than me but they gave me the information so I would know about them.  40 years later I finally meet my sisters but due to the fact I already knew about them it wasn't a shock and I was more accepting of them.  At least tell them about her.", "It's because you have no knowledge about this sibling at all. Think about if this is something that you, your children and your family are ready to deal with. You will be opening up a can...it can be roses or it can be worms. Whatever you decide you have to make sure you are ready for whatever comes and your children.  More so you because ifshe turns out to be bad news you are the one who will have to be strong and support your children. If you decide to move forward, make sure you get to know this sibling as well as you can before you introduce them to your children.", "Inform each of your  children  when they turn 17 or 18 and let them decide  for themselves  if they  want contact  with her. \nThat being  said  meet her before she gets  to meet any of your kids  and keep an eye to see what type of person  she is.\nNta  for being  protective of your children.", "Is there any way to contact the birth mother to ask how her meeting went?", "You wouldn\u2019t know unless you ask your kids what the think? This doesn\u2019t only affect you but your kids. Your kids specially the older two should decide what the want to do. It gives them independence and helps them with adult hood. With the boundaries thing you should talk to your kids about that. You could even make a list of boundaries if that helps but the boundaries have to be on your kids terms not on your terms. You even could meet her first if you like and talk about the situation and your kids boundaries and that she has to respect them and how it goes.This all depends if the want to meet her or not. I would also talk to a therapist about this and maybe get your kids one as well. I don\u2019t want to be rude but it might be better for the therapist to help them process it and the decides instead of you because the might feel pressured.", "You could consider meeting her yourself, alone, first. Get to know her a little, that May assuage your fears about her motive. I\u2019m sure she would love to hear stories of your husband. And if she\u2019s genuine, she will understand your hesitation to let her meet the kids right away. \n\nAnd I do agree with the others, let your kids have a say.", "Your father made a decision for you about the nature of your relationship that went against the relationship you wanted to have with him. Unfortunately, you could be doing the same thing to your children. What if they *want* a relationship with their sister and find out you took that possibility away from them against their wishes?", "So wait another 5-6 years before telling any of them then? I just think you are not being realistic about this. Who are you trying to protect and from what?", "Ok so do it responsibly. \n\n1. Mom meets her in a neutral location, has a conversation about her life/interests/etc to see if there are any red flags. If all goes well, tell her the children don\u2019t know about her yet, but you\u2019ll be telling them about her and will ask them if they\u2019re open to meeting her and be consulting a therapist about if/when/how to do so. \n\n2. Mom has a discussion with her children about how they have a half sibling. Allows children time to process. \n\n3. Mom consults with therapist, gets their viewpoint. Potentially has the kids meet with a therapist to process potential grief for their father this may bring up or questions they may have or processing their feelings about having a half-sister they didn\u2019t know about and how they would feel about meeting her. \n\n4. Mom asks kids if they want to meet half-sister \n\n5.

I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting OP let her kids run off with the half sister without any supervision or allow then unfettered access to her kids without supervision.", "That's 9 years from now for them all to be adults. Way too long to wait.\n\nI do agree that you don't just jump to a meeting straight away. Needs to be a lot of discussion first, some vetting, then the kids can decide on meeting or not.", "Kids meet strangers all the time. Lol what.", "Fair enough, but the way OP talks about it makes it sound like she is just closing the door on this forever.", "Right, nothing about this stains their father's reputation. He wasn't ready to be a parent. There was no cheating.", "You know, pre-categorising an adopted person as potentially \u201cpushy or a leech\u201d is actually a harmful and disrespectful stereotype. \n\nYes, she will have trauma and, yes, this will manifest. Yes it will be harder for the person who, as an infant, was ejected from the family hearth. Yes, she will have more emotions at stake. Yes, she will have more of her sense of self at stake. Why? Because of what happened to her, because of what was done to her. \n\nWe can treat people with kindness, respect, and care\u2014especially our children\u2019s sister\u2014regardless. We can soothe some of that harm just by not being arseholes.", "How am I not being realistic lol. And I didn\u2019t suggest waiting, I actually didn\u2019t suggest any solution at all. I was merely pointing out that your comment that 15, 14, and 9 are not too young might be incorrect, especially when you\u2019re lumping in kids in their teens with a much younger child.", "This, 100%.", "Context\u2026", "Not at all. I was responding within the context of the above comments. Choice to meet vs. choice to be made aware.", ">That's 9 years from now for them all to be adults. Way too long to wait.\n\nTherein lies the problem.  I think 15 and 14 might be able to handle this, but not necessarily the 9 year old.  In fact, we're not in the family, we're not the OP, so we have no idea how any of them would handle it.  What if the older kids hate idea of knowing or meeting the half-sister, but the 9 year old loves it?  Or the opposite?  Or some other variation?  And then that drives a wedge between the siblings and their mother?  Or causes other frustrations?  \n\nI just don't think there is a simple answer.  But just telling them all and hoping for the best certainly isn't it.", "And there\u2019s no guarantee they won\u2019t find that information out in the meantime.", "Did you miss the fact that OP had a lost relative come into their life in exactly that way?\n\nAnd that I pointed out my adopted out brother and his family was not at all that way?\n\nAnd that I urged her Not to ban the sister from contact with her kids?\n\nOP has good reason for being wary of relatives that pop up out of the woodwork.\n\nAcknowledging that her reasons are valid but her risk calculation is off is a lot better than pretending the sister has No chance of being pushy or a leech.\n\nHeck, my brother\u2019s parents had that problem from the bio side of their other kid.  His little sister contacted bio mom and her whole bio family spent years  trying to coerce money out of my brother\u2019s entire family.  Because addicts.\n\nContacting severed or estranged or previously unknown bio family Is sometimes risky.", "Lol at people who downvote for saying pre-categorising adopted people as pushy leeches are rude as fuck. You got your feelings hurt, Kaz. Boo. But it\u2019s still rude as fuck. Stop stereotyping adopted people this way. Humanity. Compassion.", "You're right, their classmates don't share half their biology with them, unlike their SISTER.", "I didn\u2019t think they were stereotyping \u201cadopted people\u201d. They also said she most likely just wants to meet her bio family. Literally any stranger could be pushy or a leech. The stranger in this situation just happens to be adopted. At least that\u2019s how I read it.", "Since when does sharing DNA automatically mean that a perfect stranger is a-ok to meet your minor children???", "It\u2019s literally a stereotype about adopted people.
