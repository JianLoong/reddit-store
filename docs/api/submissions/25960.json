NTA", "NTA\n\nAssuming she was fully cropped out and not identifiable in any way, I think what you did is fair. She doesn't want pictures of herself posted, and you didn't post any. \n\nTBH her being weird about posting some photos from a music festival is weird but fine. Her having a problem with you posting pictures of yourself at a music festival is unreasonable and attempting to assert a level of control over you that is completely unacceptable.", "I'm sorry does your friend work for the FCC or wanted by the police, or hiding from a violent ex or family members?

Did you use photoshop fill tool? Or do you mean crop out as it just reduced the width of the photo? If it is the former then it can look bad if you didn\u2019t edit properly because of not matching and/or uneven patches, in other words its obvious you deleted something or someone.
