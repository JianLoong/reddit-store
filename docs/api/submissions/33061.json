I ended the conversation pretty quickly after that. We haven\u2019t spoken in a few days. We got the news back that it\u2019s not cancerous and I\u2019m debating talking to my friend about this situation as I don\u2019t want her to feel guilty.

I would say that any reasonable, compassionate and empathetic person would say \"It's a shame that we have to reschedule, but I completely understand that your ffriend needs your support on this day, we can have an anniversary day on a day nearby instead\" - I think it's very reasonable to simply move the anniversary day because something important in real life happened.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m glad your friend is okay and had you there to support her during such a stressful time. \n\nI\u2019m guessing if it was a male friend your gf would be less upset, has she indicated any jealousy towards your friend before?\n\nHonesty, the lack of compassion towards your friend would be a huge red flag for me.

She sounds a bit insecure (which is actually sort of understandable) and someone with attachment issues.

But this might take a bit to smooth it over with everyone.", "Your girlfriend sounds toxic and insecure.", "Absolutely NTA, you did the right thing.  A loving partner should care about the people you care about.  That doesn't mean they have to be close, but at the very least, they should care about the impact that person has on you, your life, your emotional well being.\n\nI can't count how many times my SO and I have inconvenienced each other to help family/friends. Except ultimately neither of us considered these moments to be inconveniences.  We were ok with needing to readjust and replan so the other could take care of family and friends.\n\nI once blew a job opportunity ***** when his mom wound up in the hospital, leading to testing that revealed she had end stage cancer.  I dropped everything to support him.  Whether that meant my actually physically being there to go with him to visit or rescheduling all my shiz to be more available for the kids and pets and chores, etc.  I wasn't even a little angry at him.\n\nInversely he does the same for me.  When my sister's husband wound up in the ICU on Christmas night, he wasn't upset with me for bailing on holiday stuff or that he had to take some time off work to manage all the kid/pet/house stuff.  My sister has 2 kids and, at the time, 2 dogs.  So I was at her house a lot helping while she was at the hospital with her husband.  And as if that wasn't enough, the one dog ended up needing an emergency vet that also landed on me to handle.  It was horribly inconvenient for my SO but he never once made me feel bad for it.\n\nAnd this is a many years long relationship, we've got a child together and primary custody of my stepdaughters, our lives are entirely intertwined and we're in it for the long haul. But sometimes we still need to put others first and we both support each other when those moments happen.  Because that's what a partnership should be like.\n\nYou've been with this chick 6 months and she's *already* expecting constant top priority when someone you care about is going through something huge?

This kind of insecurity and jealousy doesn\u2019t usually sneak out in one way.", "NTA, your friend is teetering on the edge of being a cancer patient, and your 6 month long girlfriend has the audacity to claim you're in love with your friend because you care about their existence...?", "NTA if it had turned out to be cancerous would the gf also have gotten angry with you for being by your friend through that journey too?

A good relationship partner will allow you to care for them and your friends without jealousy or complication.

You had a good reason to want to reschedule with your GF.\n\nThough I would say your GF might have acted out of insecurity. Your relationship is still quite new and you are obviously very close to your friend and you like to have sex with women.

She should trust you more, but to some degree it takes some time for real trust to build.\n\nI wouldn't bring your friend into your relationship trouble. Don't tell her about what happened.

Yes an important one to you both but dinner none the less. I feel like this is a boundary setting opportunity. She needs to be able to accept that while you love her and she is usually a priority that doesn't mean other things can't take place such as medical emergencies.

It\u2019s absolutely ok for adults to feel insecure. It\u2019s legitimately part of being human. What ***isn\u2019t ok*** is acting like trash because you are insecure. And GF probably isn\u2019t even insecure here, she is probably super possessive and hates that OP spends time with anyone else without GF there to continue to be OP\u2019s focus. Throwing the \u201cyou\u2019re in love with your bestie\u201d card is the guilt trip to make OP prioritize her in order to reassure GF that\u2019s not true.", "It was a 6 MONTH anniversary - that\u2019s not even a real thing, unless you\u2019re in high school.", "So you\u2019d die for them\u2026 when it\u2019s convenient for you? \n\nOP stated that his friend\u2019s parents life in another state so she would have been on her own.

I stayed with her in the hospital that first night because she was alone, had no family that could be around, and I cared about her.\n\nEvery friendship is different. Sometimes friends need different things. OPs friend was going to a doctors appointment where she might be told she had cancer. At the age of 21. In a state desperate from her family. OP being there for emotional support sounds reasonable.\n\nI would hope that I could count on my friends to be there if I was in a similar situation.\n\nAnniversaries don\u2019t have to be celebrated on the actual day. The girlfriend could have understood and rescheduled.", "I go to some doctor appointments with one of my friends when she gets a blood draw because she's scared of needles and it helps her immensely to have a friend with her. I do it because I care about her and it's a nice thing to do.\n\nIn OP's situation, the friend was going into an appointment where there was a real chance she'd come out of it with a death sentence.

She\u2019s got nothing to do with this. You\u2019ll do two things: betray your girlfriends trust by telling your friend that she\u2019s jelous of her, it is a private issue you know. And second, it will make your friend feel bad and might not contact you next time she needs support. You don\u2019t want that, I don\u2019t think.", "It sounds like your GF is being entirely unreasonable. It was good of you to be there for your friend. If your GF honestly has a problem with you being a good friend to people that have a need then she's heartless and you should probably get a new GF. She's really just showing you her true colors. An anniversary is just a day, real life things happen and a celebration can be moved. NTA\n\nEdit: just reread that it was only a 6-month anniversary? WTF is wrong with your GF?

That's what makes him the asshole towards his gf.\n\nHe is not the ass towards his friend, and sometimes you are in situations where you simply can't be kind to someone without being an ass to someone else, and if that's your partner you need to think why you're even with them.\n\nThis wasn't such a case because op could have included their gf in that decision so it's not unilateral.\n\nThere's a huge difference between \"hey gf, X just told me that about her tumor and her emergency appointment is in 3 days times when me and you have plans.
