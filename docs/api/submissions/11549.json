Our mom would always give her advice on how to handle money responsibly, save it up or invest it.

I asked my mom, but she said it's my money and my decision. I can give my sister this loan without negatively impacting my own financial situation. But I refused and told her to get a loan from a bank and my sister said I am being unfair to her.

I have a good relationship with my sister (if not all that close) and I am afraid my refusal will have a negative impact on it.\n\nShe needs the car to get to work, but she lives in a pretty big city with an extensive public transportation system. While it would take her one way about an hour instead of the usual 20-30 minutes, it's not impossible. She can take public transportation for a few months till she saves up for car repair or get a loan elsewhere.\n\nStill, now I am feeling somewhat guilty, because maybe I should give her a chance.

I have an emergency credit card I can use rather than asking other people to pay for MY spending habits.", "NTA.  She has repeatedly demonstrated that she is unable or unwilling to handle money.  \n\nIn this situation, refusing to loan her the cash is doing her a favor.  Continuing your mother's generosity only tells your sister that there are no repercussions for her actions.", "NTA.  You are not obliged to do her a favour and certainly not an asshole for not doing it.", "NTA the smart thing for your sister to do is to have two banking institutions (one for her monthly spending & one for her emergency fund for when the inevitable happens) that her paycheque gets divided into (70/30 or 80/20); having two different banks makes it difficult for her to spend the $$ as long as she doesn't keep the debit card in her wallet.\n\nFor me to save, I can't see large dollar amounts because I will want to spend frivolously so I have 1/3 of my paycheque deposited into a bill account, 1/3 into a savings account, & 1/3 into a daily spending account (all 3 are at different banks & I never carry anything other than my debit card for my daily spend account & some credit cards).", "NTA. She needs to learn, and you'd just be enabling her irresponsibility if you gave her money. I'm not even going to call it a loan, because she never repays.\n\nYour suggestion to go to a bank is a good one-she can't weasel out of repaying them, not without a major consequences.", "YTA\n\nShe needs to decide she can't afford the car. \n\nHonestly she's young she will learn in time but just punishing her isn't going to teach her. Help her but with the condition that she pays you back a little extra that will go into a savings fund that maybe you even manage. \n\nMy point is this is a skill you expect her to just have if she doesn't, and you can't just tell someone to understand something they don't.", "She always pays back the money. Never all at once, but over several months in installments. Her not paying back is not the issue. The issue is that cycle of needing money, never having it, having to ask for loans. Never putting money aside for exactly occasions like this one.", "Tell her you believe in her and you believe she can solve this. \n\nAfterwards, tell her how proud of her you are.", "We live in a country where having a credit card is, while not uncommon, is not that common either. It's common to have a debit card, on which you get your salary transferred and with which you pay all your bills; maybe having a saving account, conjoined to your debit card. At least half of the people I personally know (including myself) has never had a credit card, nor see it necessary to have one. My sister's credit score is probably good, since she pays all her bills on time, as far as I know. It's easy, since it automatically gets transferred out of her account in the beginning of the month, right after she gets her salary. Maybe she hasn't thought about getting a credit card, maybe she doesn't think it's a good idea (it probably isn't).", "I agree generally. But my sister either won't accept it or she will accept it and later pay it back in even more unnecessary expensive gifts.", "One option to further her learnings and maybe help the relationship is let her to save for a few weeks/take public transport, then if the lesson actually landed you can always loan her the money at that point to minimize the pain (and remind her that it won\u2019t happen again).", "That's interesting. I'm American, so we looooove our credit cards. I've got 2 myself. But yeah, from the sound of it, a credit card probably isn't the best for her. I can see her easily getting into trouble. It works for me because I just set all of my bills to auto-pay on my card, and pay the whole balance every month, getting cash back on all the essentials I needed to pay for with or without my card (It's literally free money).\n\nBut, yeah, it's also pretty concerning that she doesn't even have such a small amount in savings.", "Maybe suggest going to some financial education courses together. Therapy can also help people who have these types of issues. Sometimes it\u2019s rooted in something else. Good luck OP", "Yeah, same here (we don't have euros). People usually don't have credit cards because we don't really have a use for them. You can set a \"kontokorent\" on your normal (debit card) account, an optional function that allows you to overdraft to certain amount and it's payed with your next salary income. We do have many options to take small short term loans with banks or with special companies (those are legal loan sharks).", "A bank will not fall for the *but we are family* excuse and will hold her accountable, which seems long overdue. It might just be the ass kicking she needs. NTA.", "NTA. Don\u2019t needle the situation further. She needs to learn to manage money as at some point there may not be anyone to loan from. Now is better than later and boundaries are a thing.", "NTA \n\nOP \u201cbeing unfair\u201d is not what\u2019s going on here, sister is off base to have said that", "She can go get a loan from the bank or credit through the shop. Do not loan her the money. NTA.", "Don't undermine your mother's teaching! She has the option to take the bus, so the consequences are minimal. Your sister is also childish to call you unfair, it not like you owe her money, but by asking a few days to think about it, she now knows you have the money, and all she hears is that you don't want to give them to her. Work out an explanation, maybe give her 200 euros. Don't feel guilty, because you did nothing unfair."]}
