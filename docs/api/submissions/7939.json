She's currently a sahm and does all the overnight care since the baby is breastfeeding. Kind of recently (2 weeks ago) we had a big fight because I was upset over her not taking care of the house like we agreed and letting laundry and other stuff pile up. She says she's too tired from taking care of the baby and still recovering from her c-section to do much right now so it's been bare minimum lately. I work full time and need my downtime to zone out and unwind for a few hours when I get home. Anyway, one thing led to another and we had a huge screaming match where I threatened to take the baby, called my wife an unfit mother, and told her I will not allow her to raise my son if she can't do a better job than she's been doing. Looking back I know I overreacted and I've since apologized profusely as I was under a lot of stress and on a short fuse at the time. However, ever since my wife absolutely refuses to let me spend any one on one time with my son. Every night she locks herself in the nursery and sleeps on the floor, claiming she doesn't trust me to not take the baby away from her. I've explained dozens of times I didn't actually mean it. I miss spending time with my son and holding him in my lap when I'm gaming or watching the playoffs. My wife will barely speak to me and no matter how much I've apologized and tried to make it up to her, I'm being completely iced out. My wife won't even go to the gas station without insisting the baby goes with her. I get I was out of line, but I feel she's taking this way too far. Did I really mess up that badly?\n\nAdd: it's hard to hear how awful I was from so many other people. I know I was beyond out of line and I intend to do all I can to make up for it. It's going to be hard regaining her trust, especially since she was abused growing. I acted out of sheer stupidity and I've got a lot to do to begin making up for it. I owe her a real partner, she never complains or asks for much so I thought she was OK. I'll also promise her on demand foot massages for for the next 18 years.", "created_utc": 1674339844, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10i3guu/aita_my_wife_wont_let_me_spend_time_with_my_son/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jesus, you threatened to take the child she gave birth to six week ago *because the laundry had piled up.*  \n\nOh and by the way, it takes 6 to 8 weeks to begin recovering from a c-section. You are not supposed to lift anything heavier than your baby for at least six weeks.\n\nIs your wife's fear that you will take the baby unhealthy?  Yes.  Did you create this fear?  Yes.  \n\nYou should truly be ashamed of yourself.  \n\nMarriage counselling would be a good idea.

She just had a major surgery where her abdomen was cut open and a tiny human was taken out of her. That is 8 weeks light duty. She\u2019s not supposed to lift anything but the baby to feed. Her hormones are not even back to being regulated yet and she may be suffering some baby blues as well. Then you go and call her a bad mom, and said hateful shit to her. Look jerk you are a bad dad, bad husband and a total shit human. NO NEW MOTHER needs that crap! You can\u2019t apologize enough, and words hurt deeper than being hit. What you did was emotionally damage your wife and that\u2019s abusive. You want your house cleaned hire someone to help her, (that should of been done since she has a c- section) have you tried to reach out to family or friends to help? I doubt \nYou have. Oh and just so you know your a dad now you have no damn down time until your child moves out and that\u2019s gonna be awhile. \nI don\u2019t blame her for not letting you anywhere near the baby, not after you going off the deep end and being a dick. And I\u2019m wondering why there was no plan in place for the when you both came home with the baby? You knew she was having a c section. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyway to come back from this. And you have to ask if you messed up that bad? YES YOU DID! You totally messed up.", "Yta, you weren't paying attention to the discharge instructions at all... Mt husband had his appendix removed laproscopically, and he's not allowed to lift more than 10 or so lbs for a month.

When does she get those breaks? When you come home, you need to parent equally to your wife. That means taking care of the baby, helping with the house chores. Being a stay-at-home mom doesn't mean she is fully responsible for 100% of the parenting and house care- you need to do your part and are failing miserably.\n\n Also I would leave you if you threatened to take my kid away from me for no reason other than spite. No amount of stress or anger justifies that.", "YTA.\n\nA working mother gets at least 8 weeks medical leave following a C-section.  Your wife is still recovering from a very major surgery while caring for a newborn.  You wife shouldn't be taking care of the house or doing laundry.  She should be caring for herself and the baby, *with your help*. **Nobody is entitled to \"downtime\" with a 1.5 month old baby in the house.**\n\nCalling your wife an unfit mother and threatening to take the baby away was a HUGE AH move.  Yeah, you really messed up that badly and you need to start treating your wife like a queen who brought a brand new human being in the the world via major surgery, and should be pampered and cared for every moment you're home.", "YTA. My jaw literally dropped when you complained about the house being messy. To call her unfit mother because the house isn't as clean as you want is unforgivable imo. You have no clue in that pea sized brain of yours what she's going through. Having a baby period is exhausting - I fell asleep at the sink washing my newborn's bottles once - much less after a C-section. To apologize, slice your penis open, pull a bowling ball from it, stitch it up, then take care of the baby and see if you have energy to clean a house while she screams that she's under stress tooooo. \n\nYou woke the mama bear in her and now you pay the price for your selfish demands.", "YTA It\u2019s not just her kid, it\u2019s yours as well. Your work is a set time hers is 24 hrs. Seems like you have no idea how much work a newborn is.", "OBVIOUSLY YTA. Your wife is SCARED of you. She\u2019s sleeping on the FLOOR. You\u2019re asking US if you fucked up?", "YUP. YTA. She had a C-Section? No wonder she's still exhausted a month and a half later! And she's staying up with the baby?? And then you called her an unfit mother?\n\nGet off your ass and do some housework. You fucked up BIG TIME, and I wouldn't be surprised if she's planning an escape from you.", "YTA\n\nYes, you messed up that badly. A c-section is a pretty significant surgery to recover from so it was already crappy to get mad at her for not keeping up the house. And then it *way* crossed the line when you threatened to take the baby. I'm not surprised she's afraid to leave you alone with him. You know you didn't mean it. How is she supposed to be sure of that after how you blew up at her?", "WOW. Your poor wife :( \n\nYeah, 1000% YTA. \n\nAlso the name calling? A month after having a baby?! Not only is her body still recovering and will for a long time after a C-section, she is breastfeeding so sharing with another human still and most likely dealing with postpartum depression and\u2026 omg the list just goes on & on\u2026 again 1000% YTA. I hope she can find some better support and appreciation from others very soon.\n\nWhat are you doing as a parent and spouse around the house to help??", "You are the most major fucking asshole. You work much less than she does. A newborn is 24-7 of HARD HARD WORK. And that\u2019s not even factoring in the recovery from surgery and childbirth. Grow up.", "YTA - She is recovering from a fucking c-section dude. You need to check yourself.", "Wow ... Just wow. \n\nNews flash, the baby isn't just your baby, and you didn't over react, you crossed the line. You threatened to take a baby from his mother over a dirty house that you live in.\n\nWhy don't you clean the house? \n\nYta", "YTA. They cut her open and yanked a person out. And what are you doing when she comes home to zone out and unwind? It\u2019s certainly not supporting your partner. That part is noticeably omitted. Given your willingness to lie about her I have no doubt truthfulness is a problem for you. \n\nYou haven\u2019t proven you can be a responsible partner. Good for her not leaving you alone with an infant.", "Oh, absolutely you did. YTA massively. Clearly you've never given birth and don't understand the toll it takes not only physically, but mentally. The struggle is REAL. Her body is still healing, things are out of whack and that's going to impact her ability to do things like she did before.  Add caring for a newborn infant full time on top of that, and yeah, shit is gonna get piled up.  You need \"downtime to unwind\" for a FEW HOURS? With a newborn infant at home? How the fuck do you think your wife feels? I'm sure she'd kill for just 30 MINUTES of downtime right now. Time to step up, learn how to have a little empathy and respect for this woman who just carried your child for 9 months, had to be cut open and now cares for this little energy draining being full time with a husband who calls her unfit. How dare you. I wouldn't leave the baby alone with you either.", "YTA. This is all about you. You coming home to a house you don't like the look of. You being under stress even when you work outside the home talking to other adults. Even your motive for spending time with your son isn't about giving your wife a break to do something by herself, to have a shower and eat something, to feel human. It's about you missing out, even when you are focused on something else like gaming or watching sports. Being a parent is about sacrifice, something you haven't seemed to grasp.\n\nYou call her an unfit mother, but what did you do to raise this baby before you got frozen out? You say to get home and need a few hours to unwind. Assuming you finish work at 5pm, take half an hour to get home and include dinner, that's at least half past 8, 9pm that you reach and presumably you need your sleep for work.", "YTA - hard.\n\nYour wife has just been through major surgery. That is a long hard recovery. The fact she is able to look after the baby and still do the bare minimum is incredible. Please also remember that after birth, her hormones will still be settling and you have just threatened to take away her baby. \nYou have a full time job AND down time. Use the down time to do more around the house. Use the downtime to do more for your wife. Apologising after hurting her this badly with words just don\u2019t work. \nYou have absolutely gone too far.", "YTA, a great, big, gaping asshole.  Your wife is 6 weeks postpartum with a c-section (I've had 2, they are \\*major\\* surgery).  You don't even have to get up in the night, and yet she isn't doing enough?  And you threaten to take the baby?  SHAME ON YOU.", "YTA.  You know that you can clean the house too?  You work full time, your wife does more work, taking care of an infant, YOU NEED TO HELP HER.  Once your wife recovers, and the baby is a bit older, you'll be able to establish new routines and areas of responsibility, but not yet.\n\nAlso, hope she leave you, taking the child, and getting full custody, you're kind of toxic.", "YTA for complaining about house stuff when she\u2019s still recovering, period. She should be mostly resting for the first two months. Do you not understand they literally cut her open, took out her organs, then your baby, and now she\u2019s healing? That a c section is a major surgery? \n\nYou should be taking on house duties so she can heal. You work full time, but it sounds like you expect her to work 24/7 while recovering from surgery. Many women never fully recover from\nbirth because their partners suck\u2026 like you. I pray she leaves you. You genuinely sound abusive as hell.", "Wow. As a parent of one and due another any day now, this is probably one of the worst AITA\u2019s I\u2019ve read on here. It made me feel sick for your wife. YTA, majorly. It\u2019s bad enough you getting on her back about housework, you clearly have no idea what it\u2019s like to take care of a new baby. Seriously just hop on Google for like five minutes dude. Not only that but she\u2019s recovering from major abdominal surgery. \n\nAt this point I was already on YTA, but then you say you threatened that you\u2019d take the baby away from her and that she was an unfit mother?!?!?!?! Are you insane?! I don\u2019t say this lightly - that is really unforgivable and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something I would ever be able to get over. No wonder she\u2019s refusing to leave the baby with you. Your wife is the most vulnerable she has ever been in her life and you treat her this way? I\u2019m disgusted. That poor, poor woman.", "You're asking the wrong question.  You were the AH, but now you need to figure out how to fix this.  You need to really, truly, deeply apologize and at least suggest couples therapy.  You should also start cleaning the house yourself.  Watching a newborn all day and all night is fucking exhausting and it's not reasonable to expect her to clean too.", "YTA, you work only 8 hours a day, your wife is working 24/7, while she is recovering from major surgery and making food for the baby by her body (and it is exhausting and sometimes painful). You failed your son as father before he was 2 months old. Congratulations.", "Yes, you did. YTA.", "YTA\u2026.like really?", "YTA \n\nWhen you accused your wife of not doing enough chores, she was 1 month post-op from an invasive abdominal surgery. Have some perspective.", "YTA. You are really the asshole.  The asshole.", "Yes, you did mess up that badly.  She's had major surgery 6 weeks ago, is trying to establish breastfeeding, and she's sleeping on the bloody floor. What's wrong with you?", "YTA. You're a parent now. You don't get \"downtime\". Your wife doesn't get any, and she's working more than you are. She had a C section, and your reaction to her being overwhelmed and probably still in pain, is to threaten to take the child away. You don't want to be a parent with her, why should you even think you'd be one without her? Grow the hell up, dude.", "YTA - you lost me at I need my down time. You have a 1 month old. \n\nI kept reading. It got worse. You threatened to take her child what do you expect\u2026..", "Wow wow wow YTA. \n\nYour wife is being the sole caregiver for your son because you REFUSE TO HELP. \n\nYou need time at the end of your work day or unwind and relax? Imagine how see feels, no sleep at night and no help at any point during her day. The only unfit parent here is you.", "YTA. WTF is wrong with you? She had MAJOR SURGERY and you're \"gaming or watching the playoffs\"? Seriously, dude. You have to **stop** gaming and watching the playoffs. It is officially time to grow up, Peter Pan.  \nAlso:  **the** wife? JFC bro.", "[deleted]", "YTA - I work full-time as well and did as much as I could after hours, including waking up in the middle of the night to help my wife.\n\nShe recently went back to work after a 1 year maternity leave and we split all the housework, despite the fact that I transit further for work and often work longer hours. \n\nBeing a parent is a part of your life, and trust me, your kid will remember which parent was actually there for them. That's why a lot of dads are more distant from their kids compared to moms. Do the work now, and your child will respect the way you treat their mom.", "\"Overreaction\" is not a sufficient term for what you did to your wife. You threatened her. You traumatized her. You severely emotionally harmed the mother of your child. \n\nAnd over what? The fact that she just had major surgery and you apparently don't care that she's not supposed to do chores right now?\n\nAt this point you need to seriously examine your failings and get some individual therapy to work on them. The way you have behaved is not okay and it absolutely cannot ever happen again.\n\nYTA. Intensely so.", "Yta. \nI hope she has a support system and the ability to leave you and go far far away. She knows now that she married her abuser.", "YTA You sound like a fucking abuser", "YTA. HUGE YTA.

I bet she\u2019s up all night feeding the baby every couple of hours on top of trying to heal from a major surgery and manage everything else.\n\nLet\u2019s slice your stomach open, through skin and muscle, give you two days to recover in hospital, then make you go home and take care of an infant and have your spouse expect you to take care of everything else a month later. We can add in some hormone pills so you get the full experience. And a spouse that\u2019s resentful that to use not doing enough when you\u2019re already drowning. You think YOU are stressed out? I can\u2019t believe you said that.\n\nAnd threatening to take the baby away because the house isn\u2019t clean?! I would have taken the child and left you for that and I am 100% serious. My children come first. Now as they get older and more independent that dynamic will change but as an infant? You would have to pry them out of my cold, dead hands before I ever let someone take them from me. Purely biologically speaking *everything* in your wife\u2019s body and brain is currently set up to protect that child at any cost. I wouldn\u2019t give you any alone time either. \n\nI literally would never forgive my husband if he said this to me. I truly do not know how you\u2019ll recover from this.\n\nAnd my husband works long shifts. He leaves at 6am and he gets home at 8-9pm. He has NEVER blamed me for the house being messy if it is. He has ALWAYS come home and started cleaning and asked what I needed him to do or how he could help or if he should stop at the store on his way home. He KNOWS taking care of a helpless child is a freaking hard job and he has a hard and stressful job. You need to grow up.\n\nGet into therapy. Start helping. Figure out a different way to decompress. And you better start treating your wife like the freaking amazing mother she is before she leaves.", "YTA\n\nC-sections are not easy to recover from for some people and having broken sleep is really tough too.

While it could be sleep deprivation on it's own, post natal depression is nasty as hell to go through and a real cause for concern.", "You are a huge AH! How dare you talk to her that way! Taking care of a baby and herself after a c section and your b**ching about laundry and your need for down time. You do the f\u2019n laundry you spoiled brat!

YTA and I hope this is a troll story. But a lot of men are pretty delusional when it comes to this. Here\u2019s an idea, get off your ass and do a load of laundry. Agreements and chores change once a kid comes into the picture. Instead of complaining something isn\u2019t done, have the thought of just doing it yourself instead of bothering the woman who is still recovering from a major surgery, hormonal, exhausted, and trying to work out a routine. And I\u2019m sorry, you need to zone out for a few HOURS???? Nah man, you zone out for 10 mins and then you\u2019re on baby duty. Or you\u2019re on cleaning duty.

Yea you messed up.. bad. She could be going through postpartum depression and you seriously made it worse by telling her you're going to take the son she just gave birth to smh. I'm not sure how you can fix this tbh..", "Wow! Yeah, you messed up HUGE! Just because the baby is out doesn't mean HER BODY is back to normal. Plus she had MAJOR SURGERY, that is a minimum of six weeks recovery time WITHOUT CARING FOR A NEWBORN. Factor in baby care and she won't even feel up to normal chores for 3 to 6 months at the very MINIMUM! There are also pregnancy hormones that are still messing with her emotions, making thinking clearly difficult and her emotions very unbalanced and on a hair trigger. \n\nYou don't EVER threaten a new mom with taking her baby simply because she isn't cleaning to YOUR STANDARDS. \n\nThink about this, she is on duty 24/7 and YOU are bitching about needing to unwind after an 8-10 hour shift? When she is LITERALLY FEEDING YOUR SON WITH HER BODY, as well as taking care of him AROUND THE CLOCK?  How much housework have YOU DONE since the baby came home? Or is that strictly HER job? You need to clean the house and do laundry to pick up the slack because she just GREW A HUMAN, is feeding a human with her body AND recovering from MAJOR SURGERY. Do you know how much it messes up your body when a surgeon invades it? It takes your insides a LOT to recuperate, even if one is not pregnant...\n\nYou will need to step up now and tell her you are going to look into anger management and therapy as well as really start chipping in with housework. She may not trust you with the baby for a long time, but this is the price YOU are paying for YOUR ANGRY BEHAVIOR and you verbally being abusive to her and calling her unfit.

Keep at it, sounds like you\u2019ve some making up to do. Actions will speak louder than words here. Clean the house, take some time off work to help out. Apologise again and mean it.

You done fucked up. Of course YTA and you\u2019ve horribly damaged the trust your hormonal, tired, STILL HEALING wife had in you.

She's currently a sahm and does all the overnight care since the baby is breastfeeding. Kind of recently (2 weeks ago) we had a big fight because I was upset over her not taking care of the house like we agreed and letting laundry and other stuff pile up. She says she's too tired from taking care of the baby and still recovering from her c-section to do much right now so it's been bare minimum lately. I work full time and need my downtime to zone out and unwind for a few hours when I get home. Anyway, one thing led to another and we had a huge screaming match where I threatened to take the baby, called my wife an unfit mother, and told her I will not allow her to raise my son if she can't do a better job than she's been doing. Looking back I know I overreacted and I've since apologized profusely as I was under a lot of stress and on a short fuse at the time. However, ever since my wife absolutely refuses to let me spend any one on one time with my son. Every night she locks herself in the nursery and sleeps on the floor, claiming she doesn't trust me to not take the baby away from her. I've explained dozens of times I didn't actually mean it. I miss spending time with my son and holding him in my lap when I'm gaming or watching the playoffs. My wife will barely speak to me and no matter how much I've apologized and tried to make it up to her, I'm being completely iced out. My wife won't even go to the gas station without insisting the baby goes with her. I get I was out of line, but I feel she's taking this way too far.

She just spent 9 months growing a human...your child.  She's breastfeeding (making milk) to give the baby the best nutrition.  Newborns require a lot of care.  You are very mean and selfish.  She should be happy and enjoying her newborn, but you have ruined this for her.", "YTA but good luck digging yourself out of this one. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to earn trust back.

He has no clue.", "\ud83d\ude44 (added it for you)", "Having to lock the door to the nursery because she's paranoid she'll lose her baby.", "6 weeks post op and she\u2019s sleeping on the floor. That poor woman. My heart breaks for her.", "I want to call HIS mother.", "He apologized and said he didn\u2019t mean it.  Either you forgive and move on or never trust your husband again.  Either way they both suck..", "I\u2019m not buying it.  If she was 100% scared he was going to take her child, she would leave. That\u2019s protection.", "She's not paranoid, she's responding to a very well possible threat from OP, even the title is about how she reacted and not what op did to cause it", "AND sleeping on the floor with a cesarean!!!  Poor mama", "SERIOUSLY. OP needs a haulin' by the ear out to the woodshed for an explanatory session with a switch. I'm not sure that i mean that metaphorically, either.", "Or maybe rebuilding trust takes actual time and actual work - work that OP doesn\u2019t appear to have done. \n\n\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t mean it\u201d - so how do we know he means that apology at this point?", "You can\u2019t always just immediately move on. He broke trust, now he needs to rebuild it.", "Do you know this family? Do you know for certain the wife, who just had major surgery 6 weeks ago, has the financial and physical ability to leave *and* that she even has a place to go?  Even the domestic violence shelters in many cities are full.", "We know nothing other than what he posted :) \n\nSounds like they are new parents who are under stress and learning to adapt.  In my opinion, let me repeat that, IN MY OPINION, I do not think he said that maliciously and would take her.  Have I ever been wrong, yes.  They both suck because this is not how you handle being new parents by blaming one another because you all are both stressed.  Yes, he\u2019s the AH for saying that.  I also believe she is using her child and keeping the child from him to teach him a lesson (again MY OPINION based on this post).  I am not belittling how hard it is to be a new parent (been there).  It is hard as a working parent and a SAHM.  I believe that. But they both need to find better coping mechanisms. \n\nSo for my final comment on this post, I wish you all the best and happiness :)", "You need to calm down.  My opinion of everyone sucks in this situation is mine. I have stated that I do not know the whole story (as I\u2019m sure about 99.9% here don\u2019t either). By me saying everyone sucks and they need to grow up because of their child is still my opinion and I stand by it.", "When was I not calm? You seem to be blaming the victim (the wife) for being stuck in this situation. Stand by your opinion all you want, but most people are going to disagree that the victim in any situation is the one to blame.", "It comes off as really unempathetic. If that\u2019s who you want to be as a human being, cool I guess. Have you given birth?", "Where am I blaming the wife? In my original post all I said was everyone sucked.  Others said she was a victim, she is protecting her baby.", "I have given birth, via c-section.  Obviously no one here, other than OP, knows if she has support and what not.  I\u2019m not blaming her at all, which is what everyone here thinks I am doing.  All I am saying is he shouldn\u2019t of said that (I 100% agree he was being a dick here), but it was said in the heat of the moment in an argument.  I believe he is sorry from reading his post. I\u2019ve said things I \ud83d\udcaf have not meant in an argument.  What kind of life is she (the wife) living right now where she doesn\u2019t trust her husband and is having to protect her baby from her husband??? Am i victim blaming her, absolutely not-I don\u2019t even know her side of the story.  But if people here think she is doing the right thing by doing this, I disagree and feel for the baby (this is where my empathy falls), and think they need to figure it out for the child and grow up.", "You blamed her for believing her husband has malicious intent after he screamed at her that he will take the baby from her. You then go on to say if she was really scared of him she'd leave, and by not leaving it is proof that there is no risk so you blame her for \"sucking\" by not leaving him alone with the baby."]}
