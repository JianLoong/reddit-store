Give me an actual counter argument", ">I didn\u2019t say op was making anyone uncomfortable. I said that\u2019s the bouncer\u2019s job.\n\nyou said it was the bouncers job... which you claim he did... so you are in fact saying op was making someone uncomfortable... you just don't think about the words you say apparently...", ">It wasn't that OP was being rude by going to bathroom line it was that getting up so many times makes it seem like OP might have been dealing in the bathroom.\n\nits really hard to \"deal\" in a room you have not entered once... OP repeatedly got in at the end of the line... not into the bathroom... \n\n.... please do some more mental gymnastics to justify that point for me. if you can't then your whole argument falls apart.", "Because you're hugely reaching. People popping into the bathroom for 5 minutes multiple times in quick succession is a massive red flag that someone is dealing drugs or snorting lines of coke.\n\nThe bouncer was well within his rights to ask, and then OP decided to give poor answers and cuss him out.", "Because there is a difference between racism/unfounded discrimination and making inferences on somebody's behavior based on what they're doing", "Yeah tbh I have no qualms about getting downvoted especially when I deserve it but does feel a bit excessive", ">If someone is acting sketchy **or** making others uncomfortable,\n\nIt's not their problem you only read half the sentence", "I only went into the bathroom once though, the other two times I was standing outside a queue where he could clearly see everything I was doing, just to clarify"]}
