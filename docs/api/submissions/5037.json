In general, a  doorman should only get involved if there is a real situation, they should generally remain polite, and only touch a person if there is a legitimate reason/threat. Also, a lifetime ban is ridiculous based on your story. As somebody stated, bouncers deal with drunk people all the time, and drunk people make poor decisions. If you are an establishment that makes money from serving alcohol, you have some role in their stupid behavior and should understand that. Kicking somebody out for the night is pretty normal, but a lifetime ban? That\u2019s dumb. \n\nUnless you are withholding information, you are NTA.

How hard is it for you to just answer a dumb question straightly?", "I'd like to note a few things regarding this situation. No OP you're not an AH. You shouldn't have blown up on the bouncer but yanno... Alcohol. \n\n1. People in bars drink. \n\n2. People under the influence of alcohol are loud, unruly, obnoxious, and this behavior is to not only be expected but also tolerated to a considerable extent in a bar.\n\n3. Bar owners, managers, bartenders, and bouncers have a responsibility to all off their customers, staff, and anyone exhibiting worrying behaviors to err on the side of caution, stop serving and ask the person to leave prior to physically removing them from the premises. \n\n4. Should the person physically assault anyone, that's an instant lifetime ban if not arrest, if its just a drunk kid screaming at a bouncer, the kid goes and the bartender and wait staff all get a chat after last call about limiting and restricting  service to younger drinkers that may very well also may be under the influence of drugs. \n\n4. Bars can be dangerous places where people can be badly injured or even killed. That requires bar staff to diligently watch customers but at the same time remain courteous, respectful, and they should treat every customer with dignity.\n\n5. You don't ask someone what they were doing in the bathroom. That was where this went south. It's none of his business. If he suspected the young man was dealing, using, or under the influence of drugs, he should ask him to leave, respectfully... But if the staff member is just in a bad mood... That is no justification for throwing out a paying customer. \n\n6. Some people are nervous when alone in social settings like bars, I've seen them pace, play with napkins, cry, laugh, talk to themselves, pretend to be texting, and act very nervous and or shady until a couple drinks settle in, then its stumbly, loud, huggy, sometimes agitated behaviors.", "YTA- Bouncers need to do their job and be tough and you were clearly making it difficult to do his job, i wouldn\u2019t bother apologising or trying to make amends \n\n\nyou know from now on don\u2019t fuck with bouncers", "ESH\n\nBouncers are meant to look for sketchy behavior and stop fights and such. But some have power trips and don\u2019t actually know what they are doing or looking for. I\u2019m assuming he thought you were either trying to bother someone or do drugs in the bathroom. Not all bouncers are professionals. But a good many do too much. You could\u2019ve just said you were checking the line so you could pee without waiting. It wasn\u2019t that big a deal to just say the line was long. You both escalated this for no reason.", "NTA. Bouncers are a bit much at this point. My poor 78 year old FIL was pushed onto the ground by a bouncer for no reason a couple of weeks ago. Literally had a hospital emergency visit. I was livid. This is the ex-CEO of a global corporation, has dined and partied with sheiks and movie stars. And he was pushed. Onto. The. Ground.
