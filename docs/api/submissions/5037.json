What is so hard about saying \u201cI went to the bathroom was just waiting for the line to die down\u201d. You getting defensive makes you more sketchy", "YTA\n\nGoing to and from the bathroom after just a few minutes is sketchy, and his job is to keep an eye out for sketchy behavior.\n\nHe did his job and checked in on the sketchy behavior by asking what you are doing in there.\n\nInstead of answering, you gave him a smart@ss answer.\n\nHe made it clear you needed to answer him, not insult him.\n\nYou got defensive, and still didn\u2019t answer his question\u2026 which is still sketchy behavior from his POV.\n\nHe kicked you out and gave you a one day ban.

It's literally his job to keep the pub safe, and as he came on a bit strong, all you had to do was give an honest answer and not be a smartass. Cussing him out was the wrong way to go.", "YTA\n\nYour behavior of darting in and out of the bathroom must have looked suspicious. The bouncer was trying to do his job, and then you gave him attitude. You don\u2019t get to cuss out bouncers.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t give the bouncer lip.

It happens a lot at some places. \n\nYea, he went from 0 to 100, but really, instead of telling him to calm down, all you had to do was say that you were waiting for a free urinal. You had to deflect or answer on your terms and it made it worse. So in a sense, ESH. He needs to calm down, and next time, just answer the question.", "INFO: why didn't you just wait in line?", "YTA\n\nCussing people out, even if you're \"right\", is AH behavior.", "NTA bouncers can be a bit much. I was expecting bad behavior, from your title. In the years I worked in a dive bar, this is something that would have been a non-issue. Even with our strictest bouncer.

I was told I was banned. I always thought maybe someone 1) clogged the toilet 2) left remnants of a substance on back of toilet. I later found out owner had crush on my friend and didn\u2019t want to see me in the bar. You got blamed for something you didn\u2019t do.", "There could be several reasons why your behavior was deemed suspicious. I have been in real classy establishments where they had a guy in the men's room to ensure only one person went into a stall at a time. I suspect that this was because someone had been caught selling drugs in a stall or someone blew someone etc. In their mind, you could have been waiting for a client to be in there alone.

However, you shouldn't have continued pushing the issue and cussing him out.", "Everyone that is saying YTA are servile Americans, most bouncers in the UK are jumped up wannabe cops on a power trip that are just as much there for a fight as any drunken \u2018lad\u2019.
