So when the elevator finally arrived there was a woman in there and as soon as she saw my dog she said \"you'll have to take the next one, I'm afraid of dogs\". \n\n-Note- She didn\u2019t ask if I wouldn\u2019t mind waiting for the next one, or if he was friendly, she pretty much made it clear that I was not getting in the elevator.  I politely her \"Well I\u2019m getting on this elevator so you are free to get off on this floor and wait for the next one if you want, or you deal with your issues for 20 seconds. He's not going to bother you\" \n\nShe looked as if I slapped her in the face. She didn't answer me, nor did she move so I got in.

You took a huge dog into a tiny space with a woman who told you she didn\u2019t like dogs. You pushed her into that situation and I think that\u2019s a shitty thing to do.\n\nYes, your dog needed a wee, but there were 2 lifts and I\u2019m sure respecting others around you could have helped.

And your responses to other people's comments just make you seem entitled. \n\nThe woman in the elevator is also an AH for demanding you do something instead of asking.

She might not have been the friendliest but that's not required.", "YTA\n\nI understand you feel like she was required to be friendlier for you to do the right thing.\n\nBut the fact is she was already on the elevator, and when you have an animal with you, especially one that a large number of people have a fear of,  you need to be accommodating to the people around you, especially if it is not a service animal.
