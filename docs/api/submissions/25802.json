There is a girl, we will call her Amanda 23 (F), who has had feelings for my husband since high school.

In 2020, one year before we met, they had sex one time and never did anything after that. \n\nFast forward a couple years later, his best friend (the bride) from high school is getting married and Amanda is the maid of honor and my husband is a groomsmen. I was a little uncomfortable since I knew the past between Amanda and my husband, but I trust my husband to not do anything so I sucked it up and decided to be civil for the wedding events. Two months before the wedding, Amanda decided to message my husband twice asking him if she could be his sneaky link and that I did not need to find out. Thankfully on both occasions, my husband told her that he will not betray my trust like that and he will never ever consider cheating on me, and to never message him again. Amanda decided to gaslight my husband saying that \u201che ain\u2019t shit\u201d and all kind of other derogatory things. \n\nMy husband and I decided to talk to his best friend and her fianc\u00e9 about the situation, and how uncomfortable it made us that she tried to get my husband to cheat on me. We told her that I will not be going to the bachelorette party to avoid any drama but I will still attend the wedding and I will be civil so the bride and groom can still enjoy their day. A few days later, the maid of honor texted both me and my husband cussing us out for talking to the bride and her fianc\u00e9 about what she did, and that we were selfish for trying to ruin the wedding events and wedding itself. She also commented that it doesn\u2019t matter what she does because she was the best friend of the bride. \n\nAt that point, I couldn\u2019t contain my anger towards her anymore and I let her have a piece of my mind. The conversation ended in me telling her \u201cHow sad of a person do you have to be to try and have sex with people who are already in a relationship? Like are you really having that hard of a time to get your own man? But I guess no one wants to be in a relationship with the town whore\u201d. \n\nAfter the fight between me and the maid of honor. His best friend (the bride) messaged my husband about the drama that was going on. They had a big blow up fight because the bride was unwilling to just talk to her Maid of Honor to stop trying to talk to my husband. The end result was that my husband stepped down as a groomsmen and cut off all communication with the entire friend group. \n\nI feel so bad that my husband felt like he had to walk away from his entire friend group.

I don\u2019t really blame the bride/groom, they\u2019ve got a mountain of shit to stress about right now and I know if that got tossed in my lap shortly before my wedding I probably would have thrown my hands up and told everyone to fuck off. \n\nFWIW, a very good friend of mine tried cheating on his girlfriend at my wedding with my cousin. I was infuriated with him and we didn\u2019t talk for a while after. I was so offended that this dude was wanting to cheat at a wedding, it went against so much of the reasoning everyone was there. I would not be surprised if the bridge/groom have a bit of this realization during the wedding and come back to you guys with a \u201cHey, that\u2019s not how we wanted things to go down\u2026.let\u2019s see if we can all move forward without little cheater lady in our lives\u201d", "NTA - You called out the home wrecker good and proper and if that caused problems in the wedding party she is totally responsible.

Just have popcorn ready when you find out that the future bride and husband's marriage turns into a shit show.  The bride is condoning the attempted cheating and speaks very loudly about her and the friend group's thought process.  You and your husband are better off without them so-called friends.", "NTA - and good on your husband for stepping away.  Y'all don't need that drama llama (Amanda) around, and if she's the bride's bestie, then she'd always be on the fringes of your gatherings.\n\nI have no respect for anyone who makes a move on someone who is already in a relationship.

It is you and your husband's job to handle this by blocking her.  In no way should the bride have been brought into your drama.  Why have you and your husband not blocked her?  That should have been done immediately after he told her no.  None of this would have gone on if you had done that one simple thing.

She even tried to tell me to go to the wedding, and she would just simply just not attend.

Instead they gossiped and laughed behind her back.", "I have an old acquaintance that pops up every once in a while and propositions me. I tell my wife and then block her every time. Guess what?

Or gets a new spoofed number and tries again (because now my settings on all those apps make it so I won\u2019t see the message if we aren\u2019t already friends or I haven\u2019t let them follow me, and I don\u2019t do that for random accounts). Last year I blocked 3 different numbers that were hers. I haven\u2019t heard from her since, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s as simple as \u201cjust block her\u201d.

And that shows you how much they valued their friendship with your husband. \n\nI am sorry you had to deal with this and that your husband found out how much (or little) his friends think of him. Maybe they/bride wanted him to cheat, you find out and divorce him, and bf gets your leftovers?", "NTA that entire friend group seems like shit if they tolerate such behavior. Like it is disgusting. And double standards, too. He isn't really losing good people if that is what their thinking is. Kudos to your hubs. My husband has also walked away from a friendship because his ex best friend not only insulted me behind my back, she also harassed me for a while before I threatened police. So don't feel bad about it.", "NEVER trust an Amanda", "NTA. The Maid of Honor should actually have honor and she apparently has none.", "YATAH \n\nThis could have been settled in 3 2-minute rounds at applebees or wafflehouse.", "Husband wouldn\u2019t have even been in high school with Amanda.", "Nah", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised that the bride isn\u2019t more upset about this situation. Her Maid of Honor is literally using the wedding as a ploy to get a married man to cheat on his wife. How is that in anyway respectful to the marrying couple? She\u2019s more a Maid of the Hour than a Maid of Honor. \n\nIf you want to be petty, put a link to this post on social media and give a prediction on how long the marriage lasts with friends like that. After all, she might go after the Groom too, she obviously has no shame.", "NTA- it\u2019s always heartbreaking to have to distance yourself from a friend group but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen.", "If she\u2019s willing to hit on a married man, does the bride not want to question if she\u2019s hit on her fianc\u00e9e too? She sounds messy, and for the bride to ignore the major red flags? Good luck to their marriage.", "I don\u2019t know your relationship but I am always suspicious of \u201ca friend I fucked one time.\u201d why hasn\u2019t he cut her off entirely?\n\nNTA", "NTA for fighting with her, but your husband kind of is for sleeping with her, knowing she had feelings for him but still saying nope, not interested.", "NTA.  I\u2019m willing to wager that you could have been completely oblivious to all of it and it still would have ended the same way.  She was already pushing, and he would have said something to his best friend in attempt to stop it.  Blow up still would have happened.", ">The end result was that my husband stepped down as a groomsmen and cut off all communication with the entire friend group.\n\nSmooth operator operating correctly.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Seems to me that Amanda didn't like being called out by a woman she doesn't respect and would prefer to ignore. You made it so that she couldn't ignore your existence and she lashed out.", "NTA It sounds like it wasn't even about the argument. It was about Amanda being all Fatal Attraction and your husband not wanting to be around her. And the friend group taking Amanda's side.", "I would have kicked Amanda to the moon! NTA. That group is not worth your time of day.", "Amanda totally deserved that but I see how some people would see it as a bit of slut shaming two wrongs don't make a right,  like if she left OP's husband alone the rest of her sex life wouldn't be OP's concern", "Yep", "There was gaslighting, I just used a poor example due to my emotions towards the whole situation. She has told him that he changed and she doesn\u2019t recognize him anymore. That ever since he became a Christian, he acted holier than though. She said a lot", "Best believe I wanted to speak up for my husband when it came to his \u201cfriends\u201d, but my husband asked me not to for the sake of their wedding. Even though he felt completely backstabbed, he still wanted them to have a happy and good wedding. He has a heart of an angel, hence why I married him. When my husband decided to walk away from the bride/groom, I saw how hurt he was and it killed me to see him like that to the point, I questioned if I should have just sucked it up and been civil until the wedding was over.", "Sounds like a freshman girl got obsessed with a senior. He didn\u2019t sleep with her until she was 20 and he was 24\u2026", "I\u2019m not gonna lie, I don\u2019t really know her age. Never bothered to ask. I just asked my husband how old she was just now for the post and that was his answer \ud83d\ude05 we more than likely got the age wrong", "Naw if you message a married man asking to be his side piece, you deserve to have your name in lights in Times Square so the rest of the world knows to watch out for you. Don't white knight a ho.", "Bro get off your high horse. Everyone \u201cslut shames\u201d at some point in their life and in this situation Amanda deserves it, as well as OP should have beat the brakes off of Amanda. Stop trying to be a big person and just be human", "It\u2019s usually not cool, but I feel like slut shaming is fair game for the spouse of the person the slut tries to bang.", "Like, aren\u2019t you secure in your relationship with your husband, why does any of this even matter?", "That's not gaslighting, that's just talking shit. You heard a term and thought it vaguely applied so you just went with it, that makes it harder for people who have actually been gas lit.", "That\u2019s not gaslighting. Gaslighting is lying about objective facts. Those are opinions.", "You need a restraining order!", "ONCE YOU HEAR ME, YOU WILL SEE I AM RIGHT", "I don't think the problem is that people are fragile but demand to be heard.  \n\nRather, it is insistent people \"who don't take no for an answer\"  that want to continue to stalk and proposition others after being refused numerous times.\n\nBTW, people can be fragile for all sorts of reasons:  emotionally abusive childhood, depression and anxiety, socially awkward, complicated grief, etc.  These people NEED to be heard and given the dignity of being listened to."]}
