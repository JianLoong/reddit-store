There is a girl, we will call her Amanda 23 (F), who has had feelings for my husband since high school. He has repeatedly told her that he was not interested in being in a relationship with her for years. In 2020, one year before we met, they had sex one time and never did anything after that. \n\nFast forward a couple years later, his best friend (the bride) from high school is getting married and Amanda is the maid of honor and my husband is a groomsmen. I was a little uncomfortable since I knew the past between Amanda and my husband, but I trust my husband to not do anything so I sucked it up and decided to be civil for the wedding events. Two months before the wedding, Amanda decided to message my husband twice asking him if she could be his sneaky link and that I did not need to find out. Thankfully on both occasions, my husband told her that he will not betray my trust like that and he will never ever consider cheating on me, and to never message him again. Amanda decided to gaslight my husband saying that \u201che ain\u2019t shit\u201d and all kind of other derogatory things. \n\nMy husband and I decided to talk to his best friend and her fianc\u00e9 about the situation, and how uncomfortable it made us that she tried to get my husband to cheat on me. We told her that I will not be going to the bachelorette party to avoid any drama but I will still attend the wedding and I will be civil so the bride and groom can still enjoy their day. A few days later, the maid of honor texted both me and my husband cussing us out for talking to the bride and her fianc\u00e9 about what she did, and that we were selfish for trying to ruin the wedding events and wedding itself. She also commented that it doesn\u2019t matter what she does because she was the best friend of the bride. \n\nAt that point, I couldn\u2019t contain my anger towards her anymore and I let her have a piece of my mind. The conversation ended in me telling her \u201cHow sad of a person do you have to be to try and have sex with people who are already in a relationship? Like are you really having that hard of a time to get your own man? But I guess no one wants to be in a relationship with the town whore\u201d. \n\nAfter the fight between me and the maid of honor. His best friend (the bride) messaged my husband about the drama that was going on. They had a big blow up fight because the bride was unwilling to just talk to her Maid of Honor to stop trying to talk to my husband. The end result was that my husband stepped down as a groomsmen and cut off all communication with the entire friend group. \n\nI feel so bad that my husband felt like he had to walk away from his entire friend group.

I don\u2019t really blame the bride/groom, they\u2019ve got a mountain of shit to stress about right now and I know if that got tossed in my lap shortly before my wedding I probably would have thrown my hands up and told everyone to fuck off. \n\nFWIW, a very good friend of mine tried cheating on his girlfriend at my wedding with my cousin. I was infuriated with him and we didn\u2019t talk for a while after. I was so offended that this dude was wanting to cheat at a wedding, it went against so much of the reasoning everyone was there. I would not be surprised if the bridge/groom have a bit of this realization during the wedding and come back to you guys with a \u201cHey, that\u2019s not how we wanted things to go down\u2026.let\u2019s see if we can all move forward without little cheater lady in our lives\u201d", "NTA - You called out the home wrecker good and proper and if that caused problems in the wedding party she is totally responsible.

Stick to you guns.", "NTA\n\nYour husband clearly didn't lose anything of value.\n\nMOH was trying to get your husband to cheat, your husband was based and refused to budge and blocked her, and the bride/groom sided with the woman trying to destroy your marriage. Says a lot about them.\n\nI don't see why the rest of his friend group should be alienated.", "NTA.  Just have popcorn ready when you find out that the future bride and husband's marriage turns into a shit show.  The bride is condoning the attempted cheating and speaks very loudly about her and the friend group's thought process.  You and your husband are better off without them so-called friends.", "NTA - and good on your husband for stepping away.  Y'all don't need that drama llama (Amanda) around, and if she's the bride's bestie, then she'd always be on the fringes of your gatherings.\n\nI have no respect for anyone who makes a move on someone who is already in a relationship.

Not a good friend.", "NTA how long before she tries to sleep woth the groom", "YTA, but this is also an E-S-H because your husband is a huge one as well as the MOH.   It is you and your husband's job to handle this by blocking her.  In no way should the bride have been brought into your drama.  Why have you and your husband not blocked her?  That should have been done immediately after he told her no.  None of this would have gone on if you had done that one simple thing.

She even tried to tell me to go to the wedding, and she would just simply just not attend.

Instead they gossiped and laughed behind her back.", "I have an old acquaintance that pops up every once in a while and propositions me. I tell my wife and then block her every time. Guess what? She makes a new FB/insta/snap account and tries again. Or gets a new spoofed number and tries again (because now my settings on all those apps make it so I won\u2019t see the message if we aren\u2019t already friends or I haven\u2019t let them follow me, and I don\u2019t do that for random accounts). Last year I blocked 3 different numbers that were hers. I haven\u2019t heard from her since, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s as simple as \u201cjust block her\u201d.
