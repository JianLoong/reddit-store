My parents kicked all of us out when we were 18. \n\nWhen I was 18, my older sister was escaping a bad relationship. She had a 10 month old girl and she was 7 months pregnant. She asked if I could help with the girls until she got on her feet. For the next 5 years, I stayed with the kids during the day and worked nights while she went to school and worked during the day. We barely scraped by during those 5 years. We lived in a van, in a \"converted\" garage, eventually worked our way to a one bedroom apartment. My sister graduated and got a better job shortly after the youngest went to school. She worked 2 jobs so she could pay for me to go to school and cover all of our expenses. 3 years later, I graduated and she got married. She and her husband have 2 more kids, a girl and a boy, and they're in a big house. All of the kids have their own rooms and I have an apartment in the backyard that she refuses to charge rent for. I still work nights and I pick all of the kids up from school/daycare between 2 and 3, take them home, and watch them until 4-5. \n\nI love my nieces and nephew with all my heart but I'm especially close with the older two. I tend to spoil them a little more and they have sleepovers at my place all the time. My sister gets it and she makes sure to make up for it with the younger two but it drives her husband crazy. I'm also much closer to all of my sister's kids than any of my other siblings kids and they always complain about it when we're together. \n\nThe older two are spending the night with me tonight and my BIL said something about me being a shitty aunt. The girls heard it and are upset and I wanted to know if I was the asshole.

You are always going to be closer with those you have spent the most time with.\n\nThis should be obvious to anyone. I get that maybe this is an issue for him, but it doesn't make you a shitty aunt. Also him feeling that way means he doesn't have any empathy for what you all went through together.", "NTA, it\u2019s not like you are the mom and you are neglecting your younger children. \nYou are the aunt and obviously went through so much with the older two, created so much more memories with them. You are being an amazing aunt, your BIL is being a shitty BIL and shitty human for making you feel bad about you self for being a great aunt to his step daughters.", "I'd remind that brother in law about how much you sacrificed so they could be better off then ask him to stop being such a shitty BIL. Also spending time with 2 kids close in age is much different than spending time with 4 kids at least 8 years or so apart. However I'd try to find other special things to do just with the other 2 as well.", "NTA\n\nBIL needs to stop causing trouble. He likely can't imagine what you and your siblings overcame to get where you are today. I think it is wonderful that you and your sister were able to help each other and succeed. \n\nIt is reasonable and expected that you have a special bond with children after sharing hardship together. It is also reasonable that BIL worries about his children's feelings when he observes a disparity. Sadly he is causing hurt feelings when he objects where the children can hear him. Your sister is already compensating to make sure the little ones feel special too, and they probably love getting all of their parent's attention.\n\nPerhaps you can ask your sister to emphasize to the younger ones how much you love all of them, and how much fun they will have on sleepovers once they are as old as their siblings. By then the older ones will likely be away at college/university, and you can bond with the younger ones about how much you miss them.", "NTA. I'm sure BIL knows the story you just told. Tell him that you and your sister and the 2 oldest went through a very tough time to survive and strive for better. It created quite the bond. Now that y'all are in a better place, it's only natural that you still have that strong bond whereas the younger 2 were born under better circumstances. Tell him that you don't even have a strong bond with your other siblings or any of their kids either. If he can't understand that then HE'S T.A.", "NTA.. But your BIL is teetering the line for talking that way within earshot of the kids. \n\nYou've formed a special bond with the older two, so naturally you're going to continue cherishing them. But, if you keep playing favorites be prepared because, while the twins are still too young rn, they may notice some day and you might have to answer some hard questions or face some resentment. \n\nTo prevent that, you might consider doing something separate with them, as well. For example, take them to the playground or out for ice cream. So they can have some one-on-one time with you, and won't potentially get jealous down the road.", "ESH\n\nChildren aren't stupid. They see the other kids being treated differently, being able to have a sleepover at your place but they have to stay home. When children see other kids being treated better than them, they feel it. And it hurts. And when they hurt, their parents hurt for them as well.\n\nFavoritism and playing favorites isn't lost on children, even very young ones. \n\nYour BIL needs to sit down with you and your sister and discuss everything out in the open. Making a comment like that isn't solving anything.", "I'm going *^(borderline)* YTA, but hear me out...\n\nI totally understand you being closest to your eldest nieces; you went through a lot together.  It's natural to have a super close bond with them and feel like they're like your own kids.  BUT, when you have a blended family, you have to treat everyone the same, especially kids.  They don't understand.  They just know they're being left out or treated differently.  \n\nOne way to get out the sleepover thing could be only taking 2 at a time because 4 kids is a LOT to handle on your own.\n\nAnyway...you have some room for improvement, but you're not *totally* the AH, but you are kind of a little.", "You need to do better to foster a relationship with the younger two. Have them over - just the two of them. Have a movie night with them. Something. Showing favoritism when they live in the same house \u2026 that sucks.", "ESH, i get why your closer to them but your showing favoritism and it\u2019s going to lead to a lot of issues, especially with your sister and her other children.", "NTA; the fact is you literally acted as a parent to the older kids, together with your sister. To you, they are like your own kids. It\u2019s just not possible to be the same with his kids.", "YTA sorry but you can't treat them to different I know you were close with first two children more but they will notice when they get older. And it might effect the children relationship with each other too.", "Gently, YTA.  No matter what your reasons are; you live in the backyard apartment and clearly favor the older 2 kids over the younger 2.  BIL could absolutely have phrased it better.  However, you are blatantly showing his children that they will never be good enough for you.  You can't justify it by saying you also treat your other siblings's kids worse too.  At least they don't have to see it everyday in their own home.  It sounds like you're blaming the little ones for never financially struggling.  That is 100% unfair.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

They don't need op as much as the older ones do. Who not only struggled so much, but now have to see mom having a redo family.", "Oh fuck that noise. LOL. I change my answer.  NTA.", "They don't now (and I think it's weird for BIL to be bringing it up before it's an actual issue), but I do think that you should think about what resources you have for all four nibblings in the coming years.\n\nLike, by the time the younger ones are 4, they'll be wanting to spend time with you, too. If your older nieces aren't happy to share hangouts and sleepovers at your place with the younger two, how are the adults going to handle that? \n\nNTA because the situation atm seems to be working fine, and it makes sense to treat the kids differently based on the age gap between them."]}
