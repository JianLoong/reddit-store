It is also reasonable that BIL worries about his children's feelings when he observes a disparity. Sadly he is causing hurt feelings when he objects where the children can hear him. Your sister is already compensating to make sure the little ones feel special too, and they probably love getting all of their parent's attention.\n\nPerhaps you can ask your sister to emphasize to the younger ones how much you love all of them, and how much fun they will have on sleepovers once they are as old as their siblings. By then the older ones will likely be away at college/university, and you can bond with the younger ones about how much you miss them.", "NTA. I'm sure BIL knows the story you just told. Tell him that you and your sister and the 2 oldest went through a very tough time to survive and strive for better. It created quite the bond. Now that y'all are in a better place, it's only natural that you still have that strong bond whereas the younger 2 were born under better circumstances.

They don't understand.  They just know they're being left out or treated differently.  \n\nOne way to get out the sleepover thing could be only taking 2 at a time because 4 kids is a LOT to handle on your own.\n\nAnyway...you have some room for improvement, but you're not *totally* the AH, but you are kind of a little.", "You need to do better to foster a relationship with the younger two.

No matter what your reasons are; you live in the backyard apartment and clearly favor the older 2 kids over the younger 2.  BIL could absolutely have phrased it better.  However, you are blatantly showing his children that they will never be good enough for you.  You can't justify it by saying you also treat your other siblings's kids worse too.

If your older nieces aren't happy to share hangouts and sleepovers at your place with the younger two, how are the adults going to handle that? \n\nNTA because the situation atm seems to be working fine, and it makes sense to treat the kids differently based on the age gap between them.", "A little bit yeah. Look you raised your eldest 2 nieces. You went through homelessness with them and crawled up to your current situation with them. Of course you're closer, you raised them. I think you need to start claiming that parent role. \"I'm a parent to Anna and Elsa. They don't have a Dad. Me and their Mum were their only parents for 8 years. All my other nieces/nephews have a Mum and Dad and financial stability. So I get to be an Aunt with them\". \n\nSpeaking of your Aunt role, why can't you also have occasional Auntie sleepovers with your younger 2 nieces? Why can't you build a separate, different, important relationship with them? Same with your other nieces? I come from a family where my Aunts and Uncles all selectively built relationships with some nieces and nephews and not others. Even as a kid, I could rationalise that some family were closer because they lived in the same city, Uncle Adam was more Dad than uncle to nephew John, etc. What I couldn't rationalise - and still can't understand - was not even trying to get to know the rest of us. Not attempting to build any relationship with us. Didn't we deserve a village too?\n\nAnd thank God you are never going to have the same relationship with your younger 2 nieces. This means they have an involved Dad who is a good man. They are being raised with financial stability. Aren't these good things? Do these things mean you can't build your own special, important, different Auntie relationship with them? Equity not equality. Different love but still love. \n\n**Edit:** I saw in a comment your youngest niece and nephews aren't yet 2. Your BIL is being absolutely ridiculous. From your post I understood the younger 2 were like 5 or 6. Leaving the comment because forming a different yet valued relationship with your younger nieces will become important when they're older. Obviously you can't take a baby and a toddler over for \"fun bonding\" sleepovers, they're way too young, what kind of parents would allow that? And obviously your older 2 nieces will let themselves into your apartment. You raised them, they see you as a parent.", "saw you say the younger ones aren\u2019t even 2 yet\u2026 lol NTA and BIL is being kind of ridiculous. \n\nalso the story with you and your sister is amazing and i\u2019m glad you two overcame all of those things together. it was so refreshing to read, wishing you all the best moving forward still!!", "From an emotional POV, you\u2019re one of the kids\u2019 parents.

We had 2 more together, adopted 1, and he adopted my 3. \n\nI love all my kids with everything in me- but my older 3 and I share a bond in a way that I don\u2019t with the other 3. We were never homeless but we went through other stuff together. It bonded us. \n\nI share a bond with my adopted daughter, too. We got her at 13 and it was *rough*. She didn\u2019t want us, she wanted her biomom. I fought for her and I fought with her. We built our relationship through blood, sweat, and tears and now I\u2019m her mom. \n\nI\u2019m bonded to the next one bc she has severe ADHD, like me, and I\u2019ve always understood her in a way that no one else does. \n\nMy youngest and I have a bond bc I accidentally birthed her at home, alone, into the toilet. She gave me a gift when she forced me to be strong and go through something I never thought I\u2019d ever do. She gifted me with finally understanding just how strong and capable of a woman I am. \n\nThere are different bonds between people and they all need to be respected. None of the other kids will ever understand what I have with my oldest 3. But my oldest 3 will never understand how my adopted daughter and I fought so hard for our relationship and how that bonded us, either. My youngest 2 won\u2019t bc she\u2019s been their sister their whole lives and while they know intellectually she was adopted their relationship with her will always be a bio-sister bond, where the oldest 3 remember life before her. \n\nAnd not one of the lot of \u2018em understands why I love the dog more than all of them combined. ;) \n\nIt sounds like BIL can\u2019t comprehend that y\u2019all forged your bonds through adversity, pain, heartbreak, and hunger. Trauma binds ppl together in a way that others might not understand.

My aunt is distant with us all now due to not living near us and not seeing us as often. My sisters have always had a much better relationship with our parents (Their dad is my stepdad) than I did. Mine and my mum\u2019s relationship has only got better since I moved out.
