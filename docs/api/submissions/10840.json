Two of them are twin 11yo boys who I have full time along with my 16yo bio son. Their mom/my ex sort of estranged herself from everyone right after we adopted the twins. I remarried and adopted my youngest son who is 6.\n\nI've never treated any of my kids differently. They've never known any other parent but me and to a lesser extent, my wife. I've always had a complicated relationship with my 11yo Liam. He's always been rough around the edges and not snuggly like my other kids. He's not a bad kid it's that he almost needs to rebel against me.\n\nThe other day, I found out that he started telling people that I'm not his real dad. I'm his adoptive dad. His teacher, friends, their parents, etc. They were shocked that he was adopted. He even added that onto a family tree class project. It was a jab at me, his brother and my wife.\n\nI asked him about it and he said that I'm not his real dad. I corrected him that I am not his bio dad but I'm his \"real\" dad. Now he's insistent on calling me and my wife by our first names. \n\nWe have new neighbors with a son his age and I introduced myself with Liam and my 5yo Elijah to them. I said that Elijah was my son and Liam was my adopted son. Then I turned to Liam and asked him if I got it right. He didn't answer but disappeared back home.\n\nHe gave me the silent treatment but it came out when I reminded him to take a shower. He threw something at me and was quickly remorseful and cried. That was wayyy out of character for him. He told me that he was angry at me for embarrassing him in front of the new neighbors. I said now he knows what it feels like when he tells people in his adopted dad like I'm that fucking foster dad from Terminator 2.\n\nMy wife told me I was very cruel and should apologize. I don't think I was and he's 11 so he's probably over it. Talking to an 11yo boy is like talking to a brick wall. He just needed to be properly checked. Now I need to stop my wife from throwing him a pity party.", "created_utc": 1677281203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11b5ge6/aita_for_teaching_my_son_empathy/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm struggling to see where and when you taught your son empathy- quite the opposite in fact.\n\nAll kids will test boundaries and say hurtful things to their parents, especially at this age when puberty starts kicking in. By introducing your son as your adopted son, in his head you confirmed what he's been thinking- your not his 'real dad'", "YTA. He is 11, yeah. What's your excuse?\n\nBeing adopted, even in absolutely ideal circumstances, comes with trauma for a lot of people. He's beginning to cope with that. Not in a way you like - fine. Not in a way he's going to necessarily be happy with down the line - fine.\n\nBut one of the issues he's coping with is the idea that his bio parents didn't want to keep him (although you and I know that's not necessarily the case, but for an 11 year old that's a big and complex situation).\n\nOne of the ways kids (and adults!) often cope with fear of abandonment is by rejecting the people who claim to love them, so they can pre-empt the abandonment. As a PARENT, your job was to show him that he can be an absolute gobshite and you will never, ever, ever go anywhere.\n\nYou have failed at that absolutely spectacularly.\n\nYou need to do two things here:\n\n1. Realise that Liam is *11 years old* and that he is dealing with stuff that many adults in his position still struggle to figure out. Adoption is a complicated, painful thing for many adoptees. It is *your job* to help him with that and, and I cannot stress this enough, to be there for him unconditionally. He may not always feel like being your kid but he ALWAYS needs to feel like YOU WANT TO BE HIS PARENT.\n\n2. Apologise unreservedly and completely to Liam. Explain in terms he can understand that you made a mistake because you forgot that he's a kid and couldn't put your behaviour in context. Tell him that you'll always be there for him and that you will always love him and want him to be your son.\n\n3. Get him some therapy to help him work on these issues, and make sure he knows that he can always come to you with questions or worries. And then *actually live it.*\n\nThis is an incredibly disappointing thing to read.", "YTA\n\nSomething interesting I've heard from foster parents is that tantrums are a sign of trust. A kid that is rebelling trusts that their parent will still be there, and still be reasonable and loving despite that rebellion. So in this case you failed to validate that trust.  \n\nYou told him that his trust in you was undeserved and that he should see his position in you life as conditional. You failed both in teaching and exercising empathy.", "So instead of addressing a child\u2019s feeling of insecurity in the family unit with compassion you decided to bully him? YTA.", "Dude he\u2019s 11\u2026 hate to tell you this but his feelings are more important than yours.  Try to get to the root of why he doesn\u2019t want to call you dad.

What on earth do you think you're doing?\n\nYou've got a child who is trying to come to terms with being adopted. Instead of helping him, you're getting pissy about your ego and whether you're his 'real' dad or not. When you adopted kids, surely someone explained to you that at some points your kids will question things?\n\nYou're behaviour didn't teach empathy. It was a retaliation and deliberately unkind. Your wife is right and the way you speak about her and your son is actually so disrespectful and horrible.", "YTA. The way to show that you are his \u201creal\u201d dad is to keep being there for him. To keep treating him like your \u201creal\u201d son. You help him to deal with his issues about adoption by showing that you are his father. He clearly is deal with something and instead of helping him, you played tit for tat with a child. You\u2019re the parent. Stop acting like you\u2019re the 11 year old", "Judging by those last few sentences you're gonna abuse the shit out of these boys. Sad.", "YTA\n\nI totally empathize with wanting to use some old-school techniques because it feels like everyone gets parent-shamed for not getting on board with every single tenet of \u201cgentle\u201d parenting.\n\nBut I am struggling to think in this particular case that your retaliating with mean words is a better way of teaching empathy than the two of you talking about feelings with each other and coaching him to see how his words impact others.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHE is finding out who he is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU are an AH not to let HIM decide his relationships.", "Sorry but the title says 'teaching my son empathy' but I don't see that anywhere here. You are right to be angry that he calls you by your first name and that he tells everyone that you aren't his 'dad' , because if you weren't then that would mean you don't care about him. Good so far. But instead of showing and explaining to him that even if you aren't his biological dad, you are still his dad because you raise him, you are with him on his good , happy, sad and bad moments, you run for him etc , you acted as 11 yo kid. Kids / teenagers tend to rebel, it's a common phenomenon, why do you rebel?", "YTA \n\nYour wife was right, this was cruel. \n\nIt\u2019s clear your son is struggling with something, and your answer was to confirm that you don\u2019t actually view him the same as your biological child. \n\nWhy not talk to him about *why* he\u2019s doing this? Why not take him to a therapist?", "I don't think you were teaching empathy. I think you were hitting back verbally and emotionally at your 11 year old child.\n\nNo one is a perfect parent. This too shall pass but - YTA here.", "You told your son you\u2019re his \u201creal dad\u201d and then at the first opportunity publicly denied that by treating your sons differently. He\u2019s a child whose been abandoned by 3 parents, and instead of proving you\u2019re a man of your word, that you are indeed his \u201creal dad\u201d no matter what, you threw it back in his face because you got your feelings hurt.\n\nI feel so bad for your son, I hope that one day he gets to live his life surrounded by mature adults that don\u2019t act out of spite.\n\nYTA. It\u2019s tragic that you\u2019re the only dad he has. Maybe now you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re not actually his real dad he will understand your the problem, not him.\n\n(And stop arguing with the judgment. It\u2019s the FIRST RULE OF AITA. If you\u2019re so sure you\u2019re right don\u2019t post, because it just makes it look like you came here fishing for compliments and validation but can\u2019t handle being called out. If you can\u2019t handle being judged then don\u2019t post. What you did to your son matches your comments - you clearly can\u2019t handle anyone having a thought you don\u2019t like and lash out. It\u2019s sad tbh.)", "No judgement here. I'm also adopted. It seems you don't know a ton about child development nor do you have enough support when it comes to parenting adopted kids. I remember comprehending my adoption at this age. It was NOT pretty. I would hear out your wife. Don't do the good cop bad cop thing. The best thing you can do is provide consistency in the face of an irrational identity crisis your child is clearly going through. Get support before this issue turns into a bigger one. Put down your ego or your child and marriage will suffer. This isn't an AITA judgement this is bigger than that. Find a better way to parent a kid who is suffering some growing pains will ya?", "YTA big time. Kids are supposed to rebel. Parents are NOT supposed to react like children when that happens. Grow up. Be a parent. Apologies", "YTA. Way to get down on his level, dad. Did somebody forget to tell you that you're supposed to be the adult?

YOU'RE THE ONE THAT NEEDS TO BE PROPERLY CHECKED.", "YTA - that didn\u2019t teach him empathy at all, it was just petty and cruel\n\nYou are the adult, you are suppose to act better than the 11 year old child who is still trying to figure everything out\n\nJesus Christ man \n\nFrom reading your replies it doesn\u2019t seem like you have much empathy either", "YTA it\u2019s up to Liam to decide whether or not you are his dad. Liam is not in the wrong for telling people he is adopted and him putting that in his family tree is not a jab at you. It\u2019s normal for adopted children to wonder about their bio family.", "YTA.  He is obviously struggling with some abandonment issues because multiple people have chosen to give him up in his life and since he is a child and doesn't know how to deal with those feelings he is expressing his anger and insecurities by pushing boundaries.  He is begging you to prove to him that he is your son.  Instead of rising to challenge, you chose, in front of new neighbors, to act petty and in his mind prove to him that he isn't worthy of a parents love.

You didn\u2019t teach him empathy, and you have no empathy for your son. Especially because you decided to not even TRY talking with him about this. Clearly he\u2019s going through stuff, even seamless adoptions can have scars. Since you\u2019ve made it clear that he can\u2019t confide in you because you won\u2019t try and will instead ambush him passive-aggressively in front of strangers, get him into therapy so he can find a safe place to learn *actual* empathy. And maybe get yourself in so you can learn some yourself.", "YTA, he's the child and you're the adult. He's insecure about his place as the adopted child and you just made it 100 times worse.

Why? Because they are almost men and have to be grown ups... \n\n\nAlso he hurt your feelings so you treated him the same why he also threw something at you are you gonna throw a brick at him?? Eye for an eye right dad of the freaking year?", "You have three adopted children, so I\u2019m going to try to explain some psychology to you.   \n\nYour son knows that he is adopted.  He is right at the age when he\u2019s beginning to become his very own person, to break away from his parents.   For a child who was adopted, that can bring up a lot of emotional turmoil.\n\n*All* children test their boundaries at this age.   Your son chose to test whether or not he really was your son.\n\nYou showed him that all it took for you to \u201cgo back\u201d on being his dad was for *him to say you weren\u2019t his dad*.\n\nThat\u2019s great Reddit-boundaries, but not what an eleven year old wants or needs.

He behaved immaturely so you thought the best approach was to beat him at his own game? That's just a terrible idea.", "I would suggest to re-read the dictionary. This is no empathy.", "YTA and that \"throwing him a pity party\" line makes me really mad.  You're the one who needs some lessons in empathy!  He's fucking 11.  I know he hurt your feelings, but what you did in retaliation was horrible.", "YTA if you want to be treated like a Dad, then give unconditional love and don't differentiate between your children.  You need to give him a huge apology and let him know you have learned your lesson that it's wrong to hurt someone you love, just because they have hurt you. Make extra points by doing it in front of your whole  family.", "YTA.\nHe's 11. He's been adopted, then had a broken family, then a new step mum. You are supposed to be his parent, not an equal. You need to understand him better.", "YTA - your kid is trying to explore his identity, decide whether it\u2019s the same or different to that of his brothers, and figure out if rejection is something he can use as a means of feeling powerful because he has already been rejected by 3 of the 5 parent figures he might have had in life: his bio parents and your ex. And he\u2019s got a slightly more difficult relationship with you and your wife than your other kids just down to the way his personality works with yours - so he\u2019s probably assuming that there may be more rejection from you in his future too.\n\nHe\u2019s old enough to realise that in spite of you saying you treat your kids the same, you\u2019re not giving him the individual connection he seems to need because he doesn\u2019t fit your parenting style quite as well as his brothers. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s anything deliberate on your part, but if you continue to deny the differences in your relationship with him compared to the others, and to put it down to his personality rather than the way the two of you interact, he will grow up thinking you\u2019re either lying or useless - when he\u2019s still very much at an age where he needs you to be his first hero.\n\nHowever hurtful his behaviour is towards you or the rest of the family, you need to model good communication and inclusion and talk to him about these things so he has a vocabulary to express *why* he wants to experiment with seeing himself in different ways regarding his connection to your family. You need to stop taking it as a personal slight to you or the family as a whole that he\u2019s doing this, and understand that it\u2019s him trying to work out himself and his place in the world, and how strong his connection to you really is.\n\nBut what you actually did? Instead of opening a discussion about this based on his needs and anxieties, you confirmed one of his fears, which is that one day you could turn around and make clear that he isn\u2019t a \u201cproper\u201d member of the family, and doesn\u2019t deserve \u201creal\u201d parents.\n\nAnd you did it in public - if you were intent on this path, you could very easily have taken him aside and asked him \u201cwould you like me to introduce you as my son or my adoptive son to these people?\u201d and then explain to him why you would prefer just \u201cson\u201d because he\u2019s really your kid. That way he would still have control of the narrative, but he\u2019d have had a chance to think about how he might feel if you, rather than he, decided to redefine your relationship to him.\n\nAnd you did it out of revenge - you had no intention of teaching him empathy (you\u2019ve shown very little for him here), you just wanted him to know how it felt to be blindsided by a rejection because that\u2019s what he, unthinkingly, did to you.

Maybe your son was trying to present himself in this way to stand out and feel unique? Not sure but either way, I can understand how that would be hurtful to you. When you introduced him as adopted to the neighbors you were only going along with what he had just told you he was doing. I'm sure once he heard it coming out of your mouth it struck a nerve and he realized he may have been wrong for doing so but either way, you proved your point. I'll bet he'll come around after he has some time to cool off and think about it. Now would be a good time for you to have a heart-to-heart with him.

Two of them are twin 11yo boys who I have full time along with my 16yo bio son. Their mom/my ex sort of estranged herself from everyone right after we adopted the twins. I remarried and adopted my youngest son who is 6.\n\nI've never treated any of my kids differently. They've never known any other parent but me and to a lesser extent, my wife. I've always had a complicated relationship with my 11yo Liam. He's always been rough around the edges and not snuggly like my other kids. He's not a bad kid it's that he almost needs to rebel against me.\n\nThe other day, I found out that he started telling people that I'm not his real dad. I'm his adoptive dad. His teacher, friends, their parents, etc. They were shocked that he was adopted. He even added that onto a family tree class project. It was a jab at me, his brother and my wife.\n\nI asked him about it and he said that I'm not his real dad. I corrected him that I am not his bio dad but I'm his \"real\" dad. Now he's insistent on calling me and my wife by our first names. \n\nWe have new neighbors with a son his age and I introduced myself with Liam and my 5yo Elijah to them. I said that Elijah was my son and Liam was my adopted son. Then I turned to Liam and asked him if I got it right. He didn't answer but disappeared back home.\n\nHe gave me the silent treatment but it came out when I reminded him to take a shower. He threw something at me and was quickly remorseful and cried. That was wayyy out of character for him. He told me that he was angry at me for embarrassing him in front of the new neighbors. I said now he knows what it feels like when he tells people in his adopted dad like I'm that fucking foster dad from Terminator 2.\n\nMy wife told me I was very cruel and should apologize. I don't think I was and he's 11 so he's probably over it. Talking to an 11yo boy is like talking to a brick wall. He just needed to be properly checked. Now I need to stop my wife from throwing him a pity party.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sorry he got his family tree right? Wtf is wrong with you. He is adopted, it was his damn project and you threw a hissy fit and decide to introduce him as adopted child?

You taught him a very valuable lesson about himself. He learned that sometimes we don\u2019t really mean the things we say\u2014but those words can still hurt. He doesn\u2019t mean to distance himself from you by saying he\u2019s adopted, he\u2019s just testing boundaries. But that doesn\u2019t mean his words don\u2019t hurt. Good job in coming up with an effective way to teach him that. Empathy is a difficult thing to teach. Sometimes it can only be demonstrated. \n\nLooks like most people so far would not agree with my comment. Kids are sometimes assholes. It\u2019s our job to make them into adults. And sometimes that hurts.", "NAH. My sister and i were adopted by our dad. We did not know we were adopted until 13-14 years old. We had known are dad since around 2 years old and we were in the wedding at 6-7 years old. We also met our bio dad once and he will never be our dad. You can be a \"real\" dad and adopted dad at the same time. Being the Dad that adopted them means you choose to be their family. You did go about it in not the greatest way though. I would suggest sitting down and having a deep conversation with your son about everything.", "Oh please.\n\nI had him from Day 1.", "[deleted]", "He's not insecure about being adopted.", "Also, adults are meant to take shit from their teens.

Tell him you were hurt and retaliated, but you never should have done that.  And that you\u2019re so sorry you hurt him, that you love him and he\u2019s your son, no caveats.  I\u2019d tell him further though that it\u2019s his story, and who he wants to share it with and when is up to him.

He certainly hasn\u2019t tried to look at this from his son\u2019s perspective.

What\u2019s more, your actions (by getting your feelings hurt by him stating the technical nature of your relationship) confirm to him that there is some thing less than about being an adoptee - it\u2019s embarrassing to you that he\u2019s calling you his adopted father such that you complain and then act out and punish him.\n\n\nWith that said, I get it. 11 year olds can be total shits and you aren\u2019t made of stone. But there are many better work around to this one than the extremely tough love version that you chose. And, IMO, tough love with the tough kid only alienates the tough kid more.\n\nYTA.", "Having him from day one doesn\u2019t erase trauma.", "NTA,\n\nJust wanted to tell you that before my comment got buried.", "YTA.

Parenting is hard. Kids rebel. I promise you, if you don\u2019t cut this out, your son won\u2019t speak to you as soon as he\u2019s able to get out of your house.

And your son lost 2 moms. Instead of HELPING your son deal with that trauma, you decided to \"check\" him because he isn't expressing his feelings how you want him to? And shame him?? Wtf. Yes, YTA. Get a therapist for both of you. \n\nSidebar: this is why family tree projects are bad. Also, asking an adoptee to ignore the fact of their adoption is generally unhelpful.", "So you agree with me?", "Doesnt matter. He'll always feel that loss. Take it from someone who was adopted very early. Just because you dont remember them, or even lived with them, doesnt erase that biological connection.

I really think the dad was trying to show the kid how it feels to be labeled as family with a qualifier instead of as family, full stop. I think the dad\u2019s method was more cruel than the dad perhaps intended. I also think the dad was off-target in attempting to teach the kid a lesson instead of using this whole situation as a way to form a stronger connection with this kid that he sees (and likely treats) as \u201cdifferent\u201d from his siblings.\n\nThe problem is that the fact of being adopted seems to be steeped in shame in this family- and that\u2019s an issue when 75% of the kids are adopted.", "He threw his shoe at me because he felt secure enough to vent.", "OP is upset that he\u2019s losing control over a child", "What issues?

OP does not care that Liam\u2019s feelings were hurt and OP still thinks they did nothing wrong. Liam is at an age were he is becoming his own person and he has the added pressure of being adopted. Liam is trying to figure out who he is and rather than getting love from his parents, OP is putting him down because OP views Liam owning that he is adopted as a personal attack. Even if OP was well intentioned, which they were not, OP would still be the AH because he did not comfort his son after he was distressed.", "And? You're still the adult here. It's still on you to act MORE mature than a child and not lash out in retaliation.", "Correct. He knows you will still love him even if he throws a shoe at you.

A child dealing with some very big and very heavy emotions. Kids, especially middle school aged kids, act like jerks sometimes, even without all the stuff this kid has been through. His father can, and should, know better and act better.", "From an outsiders' point of view, it sounds like your son is having a bit of an identity crisis about the fact that neither of his parents actually gave birth to him. This is probably further compounded by the fact that you do have actual biological children. What you first started out doing was probably appropriate (i.e. Correcting him that you are his 'real' dad, not an adopted one). However, you really messed up by then punishing/humiliating him in public the way you did. You should've just expanded on your first point. Not only are you his 'real' dad, but he is your 'real' son. Instead, you further drove a wedge in your relationship with your son, by cementing to him that he is only your 'adopted son'. You did this for self-centered and punitive reasons.

If you were so I tuned with him, you would understand that he is going through and ID crisis and needs to be met with love and compassion not spite.

I have just as many baby pictures of him as any of his friends' parents.", "First of all, OP clearly stated that Liam had been introducing himself and telling everyone he was adopted and going so far as calling his parents by their first names. Sounds to me like those were his wishes. Second, saying that someone is adopted isn't a 'dig' at them...unless, of course you view adopted people as lesser than someone who is not. As an adopted person that is offensive to me; always has been. Like the old joke of telling someone they're the adopted child, like it's a bad thing. That seriously pisses me off.", "It DOES matter. It\u2019s great that he has adoptive parents who care for him, but he IS adopted, and it\u2019s ok for him to have feelings about that", "It doesn't matter TO YOU! Based on his actions it matters to him. You don't get to decide how he is supposed to feel about this. You're behaving like a Narcissist. Only worried about how all of this is effecting you, and not the obvious negative impact it is having on him. He is at a critical age for development and figuring out who he is. Belittling him is only going to drive a wedge between you. If you don't grow up and try to fix it, and help him deal with whatever he is going through now. He probably won't give you the chance to later in life when he moves out and you never hear from him.", "That doesn\u2019t change the fact that part of his life story is that he\u2019s adopted", "So this is about him hurting your feelings by stating facts about himself?", "Again OP did not call him that to respect his wishes. He did it purely out of spite and to be petty. OP doesn\u2019t even care how it affected his son. I don\u2019t view telling someone a person is adopted as a \u201cdig\u201d but OP clearly does. OP stated that Liam indicating in his family tree that he was adopted was a \u201cjab at the family\u201d. OP is taking everything Liam does as a personal attack. My mother was adopted and I plan on adopting children. I never said that being adopted was a bad thing.", "Yeah that's not something that just goes away.
