She acted out a whole skit about the tricks I would do as I walked away. This week my wife (f40) and I drove 5 hours to celebrate her youngest sister finishing the bar exam, and within 5 minutes of us getting there she referred to me in a group as my wife\u2019s \u201cgay best friend.\u201d This was after months of me texting her encouragement and answering her questions as she studied (I am barred in the same state as she took). \n\nLiterally no one else in my life says or does anything like this.

WIBTA if I sent a group text? What would you do?\n\nEDIT: Please stop calling my wife an asshole. She would absolutely have taken this in hand long ago if she thought it would help. We\u2019re both analytical, and a lot more likely to discuss things together rather than act out in the moment. We have discussed it, and she is just as baffled by this behavior as I am.

It also might make them feel guilty that their sister has had to ask them to stop making fun of her husband.

I quietly walked upstairs and grabbed my bag and got in my car. I was 100 miles and one state away before they figured out that their meal had burned to a crisp and I was gone. I went radio silent and found myself a little fishing hole in the woods for the next 5 days. They had all these meals they wanted me to cook over the next week.

Simply saying things like, \"I happen to believe that good men are considerate of their wives - what's wrong with that?\" when they start their BS and letting them flounder for answers about why they are settling for less is the better option.\n\nIn a perfect world, your wife would have shut this down already.

Someone someday might care enough about you to be your man slave\u201d or something similar.", "NTA - you sound like an awesome partner and they all sounds jealous tbh. I don\u2019t think a group text will help though. Your wife needs to speak to her sisters. Her sisters clearly picked crappy partners and are taking their frustrations out on you but it\u2019s not your issue, it\u2019s theirs. If they are unwilling to change their behaviour then I wouldn\u2019t subject myself to their abuse if I were you.", "NTA but your wife is the problem here. I would never tolerate this kind of disrespect towards my SO. Not for a second. She needs to step up. Or you can tell her that you are not accompanying her to any family events where her sisters are present.", "NTA. I think they are jealous because their sister found a good husband who does things for her without her asking... like a proper husband. I think they have yet to realize that a real man has no need to behave like a caveman", "\u201cPlease stop calling my wife an asshole\u201d\n\nWe will the moment she stops acting like one my guy. NTA,the SILs are, and *so is your wife* for going along with it.", "NTA. Why do you subject yourself to these bullies OP? Family isn\u2019t a free license for abuse.", "sounds like your SILs are jealous that your wife landed a solid dude. you sound like a great guy. they\u2019re just bitter and miserable and i just know they wish they had someone that would do for them what you do for your wife. fuck em", "Think of some good come back\u2019s and just give it to them.  See if they like it.  Stop being Mr. Nice Guy.", "You should say something, in person. You don't have to yel or anything, just sayam the stuff you says pretty shitty you know, or whatever. Don't do a text that won't work and if you don't say something sonner or later you blow up on them calling them a bunch of raggedy hags or something", "NTA at all, but the next time they say something like that a very loud incredulous \"Wow\" can be a mike drop moment. They have some serious problems in their relationships, by the sounds of it.", "I would dryly start asking if they really think it is so unusual to have a man treat his partner nicely?", "I'd just reply with something like \"I'd be happy to train your husband/boyfriend/significant other for a small fee\" It is good disrupter statement. \n\nHonestly this comes across as complete jealously to me and I'd try ti just internally view it that way. I have been married for 22 years and I constantly grab my wife a drink or something just like she will ask me if she can get me some water if I am outside working. In a marriage or romantic relationship you serve each other that is how it is supposed to work. If they are not getting or giving that shame on them.", "Brother - its your wifes place to say something to her sisters. She doesnt think its a good idea because she doesnt want to confront them?  but shell let you take the brunt of all this abuse.   \n\nyou need to reconsider her AH rating.", "Agreed. Wife needs to step up and tell the sisters to cut it out.", "Yeah. Hassling him for getting his wife a drink along with the one he was already getting for himself? That\u2019s just basic courtesy by OP. I hate to think what they put up with, if think \u201cdo you want a drink too\u201d special effort. How low is these SILs\u2019 bar?", "that's much more pleasant than i would be. i'd advocate being harshly unpleasesant to them and when people say it's making everyone uncomfortable, say 'well this is how they've made me feel for years, payback is a butch and the bill is long.\"", "Naw fuck it crack a joke or two it might make the bond better. My girlfriends brother was kinda of a dick to me at first, but I cracked a quick one him one day in front his buddies and they started laughing, ended up staying in front of her mothers house for like an hour shooting the shit and drinking a beer. He\u2019s laid off a bit but doesn\u2019t miss an opportunity to crack a joke and now I realize that\u2019s just him.", "Yup. Sounds a lot like they\u2019re envious of your wife\u2019s pick while their husbands are the \u201ctypical males\u201d that don\u2019t help around the house", "You assumed they are married. They are probably jealous.", "I too really love the last one.", "That\u2019s not petty. It\u2019s well deserved.  Nothing wrong and everything right with using their own words to make an excellent point.  How they feel about it is utterly irrelevant.", "Not particularly, maybe a little distant, a little transactional from what I\u2019ve seen", "Depends on the approach. A private \"Is everything ok between you and BIL because some of your comments to me have seemed really out of character, are you OK?\"", "I'm understanding of your perspective. \n\nNTA, OP. \n\nDiplomacy first, but if war becomes inevitable, extinguish them with nuclear levels of petty.", "Yes", ">Actually escalating this situation by being petty and snide is probably going to make things worse!  \n\n\n>Instead I recommend you put on your big boy pants and talk to them like an adult - and that means expressing how important it is to you, and demanding that your wife step up and deal with her family instead of enabling their shitty behavior. Your wife is the real issue here.\n\nIf they were the type to have adult discussions, they wouldn't be doing this type of bullying at all. If they want to behave like children, they should be treated like children.\n\nNext time they do it, OP should remain calm and talk to them in a relaxed but patronising tone.\n\n\"Why would you call me a man slave for bringing her a drink?\"\n\nThey could give some excuse \n\n\"I bring her a drink because I love her and want to show it. You don't do stuff for your partners?\" Or \"Oh do your partners not do that stuff for you?\"\n\nMaybe end it off with a \"I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure you'll find someone who loves you enough to bring you a drink/ someone you love enough to bring a drink to\"", "[removed]", "> The only message you can send them is by blocking them on all social media an phones.\n\nGiven what OP recounted here, this is a complete immature overreaction sure to ruin familial relationships. Are you even over the age of 14?\n\nGod forbid OP and his wife have a reasonable discussion with the sisters after giving the the benefit of the doubt and not immediately assuming they're being malicious.", "Nope, they are definitely jealous. They\u2019ll say their not, uh they are. What woman wouldn\u2019t want a dotting husband \ud83e\udd70", "[removed]", "\"Why, are you jealous your SOs don't think you're worth the effort?\" - what my response would be for every time they make a nasty comment.", "Guaranteed they can\u2019t take what they are dishing out.  Just start publicly taking some well-aimed cheap shots at them."]}
