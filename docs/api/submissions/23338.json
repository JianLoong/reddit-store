This is something that should make you feel good about yourself, but the fact they\u2019re making snide comments is obviously hurtful. My advice is that maybe your wife could talk to them, not because you need her to fight your battles for you, but because they\u2019re sisters and that\u2019s a more difficult bond to break than the one they have with you. It also might make them feel guilty that their sister has had to ask them to stop making fun of her husband.
