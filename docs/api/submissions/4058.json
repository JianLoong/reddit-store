Every year for the holidays, we typically alternate whose family we visit since both of ours live in different countries from us - he grew up in Canada and I grew up in the US. We've never had an issue with this aside from it being a little exhausting trying to get back into the swing of things when work starts up again in the new year.\n\nThis is my family's year, and it got me thinking about how they have never visited us. My husband's family has come to stay with us, but never my own. Because of this, I talked with my husband and asked if he would be alright with us hosting this year, and have it be a more intimate celebration. I have a very large family, so we'd be missing out on seeing all the aunts, uncles, and cousins, but it's been a long time since I've gotten a Christmas that is just us, my parents, and my siblings. He agreed, and I wrote up little invitations to send off. These went in the mail around the end of October.\n\nThe gist of my proposal was that it would be a very small celebration and that we would pay for everyone's plane ticket. Now, this came with the caveat that it would be JUST *immediate* family, which excluded my brother's fianc\u00e9e. We also included the fact that they all were free to turn us down and we wouldn't be offended, it was just an idea - but one we were very excited about. We heard nothing for the next month - which was putting us in a bit of an uncomfortable position when it came to booking flights (either for my family members to here, or for us to the US) but he we wanted to give people time to make a decision.\n\nWhen December hit, however, we desperately needed some answers. So, we added everyone to a group chat and asked for updates on what everyone thought. No one responded for a while until my brother finally chimed in with a pretty long text about how disrespectful it was to even suggest a celebration leaving out his fianc\u00e9e and that he didn't even know if he wanted to see me this year at our typical celebration - he basically said he didn't know if the two of them would show up if my husband and I attended.\n\nI was pretty shocked about this seeing as my invitation came with plenty of 'this is only happening if everyone's on board' disclaimers.

I have a very large family, so we'd be missing out on seeing all the aunts, uncles, and cousins, but it's been a long time since I've gotten a Christmas that is just us, my parents, and my siblings.

These went in the mail around the end of October.\n\nThe gist of my proposal was that it would be a very small celebration with only immediate family, and that we would pay for everyone's plane ticket. Now, this came with the caveat that it would be JUST *immediate* family, which excluded my brother's fianc\u00e9e. We also included the fact that they all were free to turn us down and we wouldn't be offended, it was just an idea - but one we were very excited about. We heard nothing for the next month - which was putting us in a bit of an uncomfortable position when it came to booking flights (either for my family members to here, or for us to the US) but he we wanted to give people time to make a decision.\n\nWhen December hit, however, we desperately needed some answers. So, we added everyone to a group chat and asked for updates on what everyone thought. No one responded for a while until my brother finally chimed in with a pretty long text about how disrespectful it was to even suggest a celebration leaving out his fianc\u00e9e and that he didn't even know if he wanted to see me this year at our typical celebration - he basically said he didn't know if the two of them would show up if my husband and I attended. \n\nI was pretty shocked about this seeing as my invitation came with plenty of 'this is only happening if everyone's on board' disclaimers. I need an outside perspective.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Seems like OP and spouse were willing to purchase tickets to attend the usual celebration if there was concern about the proposed small one.", ">Now, this came with the caveat that it would be JUST *immediate* family, which excluded my brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.\n\nHe\u2019s not just excluding her ticket purchase. He doesn\u2019t want her there period.", "Totally agree!  Sending a written invitation is very formal and doesn\u2019t come across as something up for much discussion. A group chat hypothetical would have been a better way to go. Also, when no one replied, he should have immediately talked to someone to get the scoop and not left it hanging. Sounds like the brother\u2019s resentment had plenty of time to build.", "He. OP is a guy.", "and you have no interest in meeting her in person? the woman your brother wants to spend the rest of his life with?", "I\u2019ll say NTA with that answer. Even if she is your brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, she\u2019s a stranger to you.", "If my brother did something to offend me, I would trust him enough to not  assume he did so on purpose and ask about it. It's sad to see how some people think that one slight warrants such a harsh reaction.", "Wouldn\u2019t you want to invite her more if you haven\u2019t met her? She is the woman your brother is choosing to spend the rest of his life with. It doesn\u2019t seem like you have any real interest in him or his life by not inviting her?", "You haven't even met her before and now her main memory of you will be you excluding her from the family? Good luck with that. I would have thought you would want to get to know your future SIL...aka your future family member.", "When was the last time you went to visit? You go off and on for the holidays, so you're saying 2 years ago they weren't engaged? How long have they been engaged? \n\nLastly, do they all live near each other?", "Well, considering how oblivious you were in sending that invitation, it would be no surprise that you don\u2019t pick up on tension imo", "How is that the fiancee's fault? And how is she supposed to meet the family if you exclude her from family events? YTA.", "INFO: would you let fianc\u00e9 join you if she paid for her own ticket?", "You need to call your brother and apologize. Tell him you didn\u2019t mean to exclude her and didn\u2019t mean to cause tension. I would call and apologize to the fianc\u00e9 as well. Then tackle the rest of your family. Budget wise, see if you can find the money to pay for the fianc\u00e9 as well so she\u2019s truly included. \n\nMoving forward, if you want your family to come out, say we have $XX to contribute to the family to come visit and see what they can do.", "That\u2019s fair enough. OP hasn\u2019t answered if she would accept the fianc\u00e9 coming if fianc\u00e9 paid for her own ticket", "\u201cHey bro, here\u2019s a fun idea! How about you ditch your fianc\u00e9e for your first Christmas as an engaged couple! Good opportunity to show her how little she means to you and that she shouldn\u2019t expect to be prioritized over a free trip to Europe. I guess she can just fuck off and do whatever she did on Christmas before she met you. Omg when you\u2019re here we can totally build a snow fort like we did when we were 8 and recreate that great photo mom has. How great will that be! Girls sux! Amirite. Omg I\u2019m so excited!\u201d", "Clearly the rest of the \u201cimmediate family\u201d thought so as well.", "This is a good idea", "Yeah there are loads of ways the OP could have proposed hosting Christmas with without coming off as the AH. His choice to send formal invitations without putting out feelers about the logistics beforehand is just bizarre though. The OP's brother got a formal, printed invitation specifically excluding his fiancee. By that point it's not up for discussion.", "One day you two are going to be married!", "Zazu uses it in the Lion King", "No, I was just making a joke built off your comment that this wasn't some random girl he met last month. Dharma and Greg was about a couple who married on their first date, so in their case, yes, she'd be family, but she'd also be some random girl he met last month.", "Thank you for pointing this out! Fixing my comment.", "I would like to meet her, yes. I think I got caught up in the idea of having a Christmas experience similar to one of my childhood of just my closest family and didn't fully take into consideration that it might come off as exclusionary in a way I hadn't meant for it to.", "If one of my relatives has offered something so brain dead I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d ever t talk them again let alone \u201coh hey just got this letter, so what were you thinking?\u201d", "The last visit would have been Christmas 2020, but obvious world events stopped that from happening. Instead, my husband and I flew over mid 2021, obviously not to celebrate but just to see everyone. My brother and his fianc\u00e9e weren't even seeing each other at that point - the relationship started towards the end of 2021 and they got engaged in June of 2022. Very quick.\n\nThey do all live near each other, yes.", "I don't know if lying to her brother about not meaning to exclude the fiance is going to make things better. Her intent was pretty obvious.  She needs to apologize profusely and admit that she was wrong, not just mistaken.", "What is that from! I can hear it in my head and I\u2019m going crazy lol lion king?", "My husband loves The Lion King. I\u2019ll have to listen for this next time we watch it!", "Well then , who counts more, someone I met last week and got married to or someone I dated for years but is now my fianc\u00e9? She probably wouldn't invite either!", "I don\u2019t think you meant to malicious, but by not inviting your future SiL you inadvertently made it seem like you don\u2019t want her to be part of your family. That\u2019s cold. YTA", "If you want a Christmas like in your childhood, your husband shouldn't be invited either", "So have you told your spouse he isn\u2019t invited to your family Christmas either? Being that he wasn\u2019t a part of the childhood ones", "That\u2019s ridiculous. Were you going to invite your husband?", "If you wanted a Christmas experience similar to the ones of your childhood, then your husband shouldn\u2019t be invited. I just can\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t seem to grasp the concept that unless you completely forgot about fianc\u00e9, you purposefully excluded her. How would you feel if your brother sent holiday invitations and excluded your husband?\n\nFYI: partners are immediate family and YTA", "So\u2026 are you excluding your husband then too? By your definition of your brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, your husband is not family and should be excluded. YTA. I don\u2019t know how you typed this out thinking you weren\u2019t the AH. You weren\u2019t inviting your entire extended family, but somehow you found it ok to exclude your brother\u2019s partner. Shake my head.", "You're a nut. How could you not see this as super exclusionary? This isn't just dinner for an evening. You expected your brother to leave his fiance to go to another country for Christmas.", "I can understand nostalgia and wanting to relive certain moments, but here's the thing - they can't be remade. The memories can only be cherished. Life has happened. You're married and your brother is getting married. It doesn't mean that Christmas can't be special and have traditions from your childhood, but it does need to evolve. She needed to be extended an invite, even if you had to say that you couldn't afford the ticket. At least she would feel included and that matters.", "You are not a child anymore. That means not only that those particular types of celebrations are in the past, but also that your brain is fully developed. It\u2019s pretty astounding that you really didn\u2019t think, at any point, that this would come across as terribly rude and exclusionary? Especially given that your own husband, who certainly was not at your childhood Christmases, would be there?", "You realize that with your husband there the experience wouldn\u2019t be like that for anyone but you? I get only wanting your siblings and that it can still feel like old times to you when your husband is there but it wouldn\u2019t feel that way for any of your siblings because of your husband because there\u2019s an extra non-family person. Is this supposed to be fun and nostalgic for anyone but you?", "Partners are family \n\nYTA", "Yeah honestly you\u2019re not making yourself look better with Mayo of your comments, just apologize to him and then hope your family want to see you", "How would you feel if your brother invited JUST YOU to a celebration? Even if you hadn\u2019t met fianc\u00e9e, you knew her enough to follow her on social media, speak with her on FT, and know they were engaged. \n\nI fail to see how you didn\u2019t or still don\u2019t see how the invitations were exclusionary on your part. Did you expect his fianc\u00e9e to just stay home alone for the holidays while he came to visit you?", "It\u2019s around I Just Can\u2019t Wait To Be King, when he\u2019s talking to little Simba & Nala", "Can't blame the brother for feeling insulted really.", "My husband lives in the home where this hypothetical get together would be hosted. I think that removes all need for a formal invitation on his part.", "Thank you!!", "You missed the point, commenters are saying that since you want to relive your childhood and you excluded your brothers fianc\u00e9 - why does your husband get to attend when he wasn\u2019t at your childhood celebrations?\n\nThat\u2019s what you are missing. Your brothers fianc\u00e9 became immediate family the second she said \u201cyes\u201d to spending her life with your brother, she became family the second she agreed to become part of your family. The same way your husband became part of yours.", "Dude you\u2019re cracked. This entire fiasco is insane. YTA. Obviously.", "You're missing the point by a mile. If you reason that your future SIL is not \"immediate family,\" then neither is your husband, no matter whether he needs to receive a formal invitation or not.", "Please stop acting like you don\u2019t understand what these other commenters are saying. Either it\u2019s about nostalgia and all spouses/significant others are excluded or you snubbed your future SIL for reasons you haven\u2019t disclosed here. \n\nEither way, this was quite rude and could have been easily remedied with a sincere apology and the extension of an invitation. I don\u2019t see where either of those things were done, though, so YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s gone past the point where you could\u2019ve passed this off as a gaffe, though, so you\u2019ll most likely be getting your wish for an *extremely* intimate Christmas since it\u2019ll be just you and your husband.", "That\u2019s not fair why does he get to be there?"]}
