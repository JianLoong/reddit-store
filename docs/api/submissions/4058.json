Every year for the holidays, we typically alternate whose family we visit since both of ours live in different countries from us - he grew up in Canada and I grew up in the US. We've never had an issue with this aside from it being a little exhausting trying to get back into the swing of things when work starts up again in the new year.\n\nThis is my family's year, and it got me thinking about how they have never visited us. My husband's family has come to stay with us, but never my own. Because of this, I talked with my husband and asked if he would be alright with us hosting this year, and have it be a more intimate celebration. I have a very large family, so we'd be missing out on seeing all the aunts, uncles, and cousins, but it's been a long time since I've gotten a Christmas that is just us, my parents, and my siblings. He agreed, and I wrote up little invitations to send off. These went in the mail around the end of October.\n\nThe gist of my proposal was that it would be a very small celebration and that we would pay for everyone's plane ticket. Now, this came with the caveat that it would be JUST *immediate* family, which excluded my brother's fianc\u00e9e. We also included the fact that they all were free to turn us down and we wouldn't be offended, it was just an idea - but one we were very excited about. We heard nothing for the next month - which was putting us in a bit of an uncomfortable position when it came to booking flights (either for my family members to here, or for us to the US) but he we wanted to give people time to make a decision.\n\nWhen December hit, however, we desperately needed some answers. So, we added everyone to a group chat and asked for updates on what everyone thought. No one responded for a while until my brother finally chimed in with a pretty long text about how disrespectful it was to even suggest a celebration leaving out his fianc\u00e9e and that he didn't even know if he wanted to see me this year at our typical celebration - he basically said he didn't know if the two of them would show up if my husband and I attended.\n\nI was pretty shocked about this seeing as my invitation came with plenty of 'this is only happening if everyone's on board' disclaimers.

I have a very large family, so we'd be missing out on seeing all the aunts, uncles, and cousins, but it's been a long time since I've gotten a Christmas that is just us, my parents, and my siblings.

These went in the mail around the end of October.\n\nThe gist of my proposal was that it would be a very small celebration with only immediate family, and that we would pay for everyone's plane ticket. Now, this came with the caveat that it would be JUST *immediate* family, which excluded my brother's fianc\u00e9e. We also included the fact that they all were free to turn us down and we wouldn't be offended, it was just an idea - but one we were very excited about. We heard nothing for the next month - which was putting us in a bit of an uncomfortable position when it came to booking flights (either for my family members to here, or for us to the US) but he we wanted to give people time to make a decision.\n\nWhen December hit, however, we desperately needed some answers. So, we added everyone to a group chat and asked for updates on what everyone thought. No one responded for a while until my brother finally chimed in with a pretty long text about how disrespectful it was to even suggest a celebration leaving out his fianc\u00e9e and that he didn't even know if he wanted to see me this year at our typical celebration - he basically said he didn't know if the two of them would show up if my husband and I attended. \n\nI was pretty shocked about this seeing as my invitation came with plenty of 'this is only happening if everyone's on board' disclaimers. I need an outside perspective.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Covering the cost of your sibling's and possibly their kids travel costs is already a very generous offer that should allow for the sibling's family to be able to buy one ticket. Or to say they cannot afford it and say so way in advance like an adult would do. And as the poster stated, in all the years her family did not come to visit them ONCE which already shows the level of fucks they don't give about her and the easy way out they always take. OP, take your core family and spend Christmas with those who actually care about you.", "Yeaaahh so you messed up. Your bro is going to want to spend the holiday with his partner who is part of your family too. Excluding them was definitely a dick move. If you could only afford a certain # of tickets the proactive thing would\u2019ve been to explain that and see how your family could kick in or get a ticket on miles or something. For their part I think your family should\u2019ve responded more quickly. \n\nLight YTA for being oblivious and uncaring & excluding your future in law, especially while including your own spouse. As much as you may want just a Xmas with your immediate family that time has passed as your siblings find their own spouses.", "Seriously - the invite in October to travel abroad during the holidays without any kind of heads up beforehand?

Until brother and fianc\u00e9e sign the legal papers making them husband and wife, they are not family.", "I need more info. Why is she excluded? If OP wants an honest judgment he needs to say why. \n\nHave they known each other only a few weeks?  Did she steal from OP? Or is it because OP just doesn\u2019t like her. \n\nThere could be many reasons but until those are shared, OP is YTA for inviting the immediate family but not her", "Seriously. The brother disnt even have the realistic option of coming because he is obviously going to spend christmas with his SO. The parents wouldnt skip the big family party if the brother wasnt coming \n\nThis is the worst half-assed mailed invitation to christmas that I have ever heard of.\n\nYTA, OP.", "I have a feeling this sort of behavior is par for the course with OP and his family is tired of it. He didn't hear from anyone for a whole month, he didn't hear from his family on Thanksgiving. It seems like something has been off for a bit.", "Reading the post I thought it sounded strange that op sent her very immediate family written invitations, then waited to see what everyone thought, let a month go by and then started a group text. This is a bizarre way to communicate with one's very immediate family. Like, a month went by and she didn't talk to her folks or siblings on the phone? Or didn't talk to any of them about the holidays if they did speak? I realize she's far from them but I couldn't imagine not just calling my mom up for starters and being like, hey, here's what I'm thinking for Christmas..... Just weird.", "Well not everyone is married or has children but I get your point. Since op didn\u2019t mention any other \u201cnot considered immediate family\u201d snafus my guess is that brother may be the only sibling where this is applicable.

Here is my vague reason for my madness\u201d \n\nI get the nostalgia, I really do. My sister, two step brothers and I haven\u2019t had a Christmas all together in over 10 years. I miss it dearly of course, but I\u2019d never dream of excluding their significant others or kids or pets even just to have the past back which it seems is what op is yearning for.

Shitty offers are taken as the insult that they are, and the radio silence was probably the most polite reproach.\n\nYou say you got \u201ccaught up\u201d in imagining an Xmas like that of your childhood, but I expect that your husband wasn\u2019t there for those so clearly you grasp that tweaking that experience to include life partners does not take away from that feeling but instead enhances it. YTA of course and you continue to be TA if you can\u2019t acknowledge the hypocrisy here.", "\u201cI understand why you\u2019d want to celebrate with just us, but I can\u2019t attend unless fianc\u00e9e comes as well\u201d is just a ridiculous thing to think someone would respond with!

That's how big an asshole you were being.  It should have gone without saying.\n\nEveryone knew this and therefore just didn't respond assuming you were going through something and would apologize for the dumb plan.", "The invitations you wrote and sent had this stipulation.

You were breathtakingly rude.", "So you wanted to see if you could get away with it and not get called out.\n\nWell, you couldn't.", "But why would he understand why you\u2019d want to exclude your SIL?", "OP, are you on the spectrum?

It's lucky that SIL will be there to take your place.", "You asked him to abandon his fianc\u00e9 at Christmas, but it was \u201cjust a suggestion\u201d.
