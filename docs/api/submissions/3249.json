If your daughter won't gut it up for one day and wear the dress, then you need to get her a tux or the closest damn thing you can to a tux that still fits with black tie. Regarding other family not adhering to the dress code, they are also AHs. I get it that no one but the bride and groom really care about the wedding, but remember it IS their wedding and their day. Let them have this one day as they want it. Now regarding the one comment about the bride dictating dress/tux color and style, that much is true. Formal dress does not mean the bride has the right to pick the color or cut of formal attire the guests will wear (I would still keep it to tasteful versus gaudy and outlandish), she only has the right to dictate such to the wedding party. So if your daughter is willing to compromise with a dark blue evening gown or tux, for example, then that is fine as it would still fit the black tie formal. I do hope that someone tips off your son and soon to be DIL about family already planning on thumbing their noses at them both regarding the dress code. Keep in mind that your son agreed to this dress code as well, unless you raised an absolute doormat with no spine, which wouldn't surprise me with how you are already stomping on boundaries.

The couple get to set a dress code but they don't get to dictate what people wear within the dress code.  What are they going to do - insist on approving every outfit before people come? It's nuts.  It's particularly nuts for kids who will outgrow expensive outfits.  I don't understand the difference between beige and black pants and why that makes it in or out of the dress code.  But as long as she looks nice and not casual I think that's totally fine.", "No! Don\u2019t do this! This is not black tie. Follow the actual dress code", "You are so NTA", "I think it\u2019s ugly \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and outdated. And I think expecting guests to pay to acquire black tie attire is entitled. Hence tacky and entitled. But yeah I said y-t-a so.. we aren\u2019t in disagreement.", "I\u2019d argue that while potentially too informal for a black tie it\u2019s going to be more formal than black pants and a beige top\u2026 I also think that black tie is a lot less formal these days than it used to be", "Yeah, you're probably right. But I was thinking perhaps for a 14 year old with the right accessories perhaps? But I've seen bridesmaid jumpsuits that might work, if the right color was ordered.", "But you did say that it was a sucky wedding and you\u2019re only going because of your husband, right? So even if it wasn\u2019t your intention to do this, subconsciously you didn\u2019t care enough to put any effort into it. \n\nHow long did you know about the wedding and the dress code? You\u2019ve been busy with a medical emergency for the past 2 months, and I hope that everyone is ok, but I have serious doubts that the wedding was planned in that time.", "YTA\nYou and grandma are rude af and you're raising your daughter to be equally rude. Why are you even asking the bride how she feels about the attire you pick? Clearly you don't care.", ">I can assure you I did not deliberately do any of this, we really are just that busy and my daughter is very difficult and this isn\u2019t exactly my society nor our family.  It\u2019s truly frustrating for a lot of people going to the wedding.\n\nAs I suspected, this is all about you being against the formal code. YTA! Not everybody wants to be casual every day of their lives!", "Look in the young men\u2019s section at Macys. They have these gorgeous sparkly suit-type jackets that would be perfect, and they\u2019re always marked way down because they\u2019re for a very niche men\u2019s article of clothing. Black tank and pants and you\u2019re set.", "I sympathize.  I am not a dressy person and have to scramble to go to a formal event. \n\nI don't think you should ignore the bride's dress code.  Figure out how to make it work or leave her at home.", "What do you guys consider black pants? \n\nHere in Australia black pants would be like suit pants? Eg. Black pants for work can often be paired with a suit jacket etc", "Would a man\u2019s cut tuxedo do if she was more gender nonconforming?", "What's the difference where you are between black pants and tux pants? \n\nHere black pants would refer to pants that can we worn with a suit jacket?", "Bought these online and they just came in.  Couldn\u2019t find anything bride asked for in the area and had to order online. This is result.", "Please re-read the post, I am not letting my daughter wear pants that are see through to the wedding.", "We have one it is about an hour and a half away.  I\u2019m guessing we should bring the pants with us, right?  We originally went there when looking and didn\u2019t get a lot of help, I\u2019m surprised to know they have a stylist but I\u2019m really not into this life style (I don\u2019t dress uppity on the regular).", "What?! Off beige is EVERYWHERE. I have a feeling it\u2019s more that OP and OP\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t like anything and decided to make their own rules.", "But it\u2019s not within dress code.", "The bride has been asking me to send her pictures of every thing I tried on.  She gave all of us very specific colors to wear and I\u2019m sort of part of the wedding party but my daughter is not.  We couldn\u2019t find anything at the stores that matched what the bride wanted her to wear so we had to order it online and we have spent soooo much money.", "Thank god you said this. Leggings are NOT black tie appropriate AT ALL.", "If you invest in one, good timeless gown or floor length dress to wear to these events then surely you won\u2019t have to shell out cash every time? There are also great options like Rent the Runway that allow you to rent a gown for a fraction of the cost.\n\nWe can certainly agree to disagree about aesthetics though and hey, we agree on what\u2019s important in this particular sub haha", "But pants =/= a suit. She would need a suit jacket AND black pants and even then it\u2019s still not really formal attire. Black pants and a beige top is hardly even appropriate for going to a fancy restaurant, much less a formal wedding", "Same in South Africa.

It means the pants happen to be the colour black\n\nWhat you're describing is the trend of a blazer with jeans, and that's work attire. It's not black tie formal.\n\nIt's a trend that started because men/women who worked in offices didn't want to have to wear suits to work for no reason. It didn't change what formal means.", "Totally!!!", "Just edited my comment because you raise a good point!", "There is a difference. Tuxedo pants have a satin stripe on the outside seam of each leg.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the hill to die on, especially in this scenario. A black suit with a tuxedo shirt (you can get for cheap on Amazon) and a bowtie would be fine. No need to break the bank!", "Could she pull off wearing beige leggings under the sheer beige pants? I know you're getting a lot of negative responses, but it's tough when a teenage girl isn't comfortable in a formal dress. Mine wouldn't be either, nor would she be comfortable in a female-cut tuxedo. Hopefully you can find a suitable solution. Good luck!", "Please read my edit, which I made before you responded.", "\u201cUppity\u201d is a weird way to describe it.", "She's 13.... People need to stop acting like their wedding is akin to the Oscars red carpet and expect everyone to spend a fortune on their day.  She's not going to hurt anyone showing up in black pants rather than beige pants.  She isn't in the wedding party.", "The whole bridezilla thing is just out of hand.  If you're part of the wedding party then obviously it's a bit different but kids without a formal role are different.  Get her a sparkly top or something to make it more formal if you're worried.", "Even under see through pants. And as sister of the groom, her outfit matters as it will be in tons of the photos", "But if they do not match perfectly, the person looks like a dork.", "But that\u2019s not black tie. Black tie means any suit needs to be a tux.", "I was genuinely asking because I\u2019m a troglodyte who doesn\u2019t understand all the nuances of dress codes", "She\u2019s the sister of the groom. She will be in tons of the photos. What she wears matters", "But the groom's sister will be in family photos which is why the bride is trying to make sure that his immediate family has appropriate outfits. If the wedding is black tie and one member of the family is dressed in business casual it will stick out in photos", "The whole calling a bride a bridezilla for every tiny thing is out of hand. She and her fianc\u00e9 are hosting a black tie event. Black tie attire is perfectly within reason. OP does not have to spend a fortune on a gown for her daughter who WILL be in pictures to be dressed appropriately. She is 14. Don\u2019t most 14 year olds attend homecoming and formal dances at school? You are acting like it is OUTRAGEOUS that the bride wants her fiance\u2019s sister to be dressed appropriately for a wedding. \u201cA sparkly top\u201d is not black tie and it IS too casual for the event.", "Oh I LOVE dress codes (I\u2019m weird I know) but I actually don\u2019t believe that gender affects the rules. \n\nBlack tie stipulates tuxedos and long gowns. If a man wants to wear a ball gown, have at it. If a woman wants to wear a men\u2019s cut tuxedo go for it. I meant to say \u201ctailored\u201d in my original comment versus women\u2019s cut. \n\nIt would be disrespectful and inappropriate to do say, what OP is insinuating which is completely disregarding the dress code. Not ALL events are this \u201cstrict\u201d in dress code either. In fact, it\u2019s only because this is a black tie event that OP is really in the wrong here. In a cocktail or semi-formal event scenario this would be fine."]}
