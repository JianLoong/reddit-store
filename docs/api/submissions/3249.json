If your daughter won't gut it up for one day and wear the dress, then you need to get her a tux or the closest damn thing you can to a tux that still fits with black tie. Regarding other family not adhering to the dress code, they are also AHs. I get it that no one but the bride and groom really care about the wedding, but remember it IS their wedding and their day. Let them have this one day as they want it. Now regarding the one comment about the bride dictating dress/tux color and style, that much is true. Formal dress does not mean the bride has the right to pick the color or cut of formal attire the guests will wear (I would still keep it to tasteful versus gaudy and outlandish), she only has the right to dictate such to the wedding party. So if your daughter is willing to compromise with a dark blue evening gown or tux, for example, then that is fine as it would still fit the black tie formal. I do hope that someone tips off your son and soon to be DIL about family already planning on thumbing their noses at them both regarding the dress code. Keep in mind that your son agreed to this dress code as well, unless you raised an absolute doormat with no spine, which wouldn't surprise me with how you are already stomping on boundaries.
