I got kinda pissed off at his insult (I was already pretty tense from a night of hard, tedious work), so I told him to piss off. Things got heated between us, and we kept escalating until we caught the attention of campus security (they were just doing some routine patrols).

Please accept my apology.\"\n\nYou know you should not have been there smoking.", "YTA. You did something wrong. A real apology is not contingent upon its acceptance or forgiveness for the action.

As a waitress, I can easily work up to 15 hours a day. It may not be saving lives, but it's incredibly exhausting on a physical, emotional, and mental stand point.

If you work at a hospital, you need to follow certain protocols, hold yourself to a high standard, and always - *always* - be aware of your surroundings and the people within it.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, if this happened with my grandpa who has to be on oxygen, I'd be ready to fight you and talking to whoever I needed to report to you to the higher ups.", "YTA.

Again yta.", "YTA. You knowingly broke the rule (you being tired isn\u2019t an excuse) and blew smoke in someone\u2019s face, which is the exact reason the rule exists.

YTA.", "YTA. And a bigger one for not taking responsibility for your disgusting action.  Hope someone kicks your ass your behavior someday.", "YTA.

Rules.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nI'm a smoker. I also work hard labor 10-14 hours a day. Before that, I would work a very mentally demanding job for 12-18 hours a day.

Every smoker knows it'd illegal to smoke within 50ft of doorways. \n\nNow, let's say that one day, I am lazy and uncaring like OP, and I were to smoke right next to a door.

It's obviously unpleasant to have smoke blown into your face, but it's not like you did it on purpose, and there's no way you could've known about his condition. You did smoke in a place where it's forbidden though, so you could've just walked the few steps to go to a place where it's allowed. Walking helps clearing your head even better than a cigarette (former smoker here). \n\nBut his insult right off the bat was an overreaction which either makes him the other AH in this story, or he was having a similarly lousy day and felt the need to blow off steam - and it just happened to be at you. That doesn't make his behavior acceptable, but we've certainly all had a bad day and taken our temper out on someone who didn't deserve it (assuming we're generally civilized people who don't otherwise engage in AH behavior).", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were tired, not so out of it you had no idea you were outside the doors of your building\u2014I would be very concerned if you weren\u2019t aware of your location (being sleepy doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re unaware of everything\u2014if it does, I\u2019d look into that). Sleep deprivation is another thing, but you were awake enough to be on campus late and decide to go smoke. Also, just don\u2019t stay out so late next time if you staying up till half past midnight means you\u2019ll be so out of it you smoke in a non-designated area, blow smoke on a stranger, then get into an argument with the stranger instead of profusely apologizing and walking away. You are 26 years old. I\u2019m surprised security didn\u2019t reprimand you further, and you are lucky for that.", "He\u2019s getting a PHD guys, he can blow smoke where he likes \n\nYTA", ">YTA you were being a dumb fuck, I\u2019m not sure why being called out on it has you this heated considering you know exactly why what you did was stupid and wrong.\n\nAs the old saying goes, if you don't want to get called a dumb fuck, then don't act like a dumb fuck... Or something. \n\nI'm honestly impressed at the complete lack of self-awareness that it took for OP to come here and post this.", "If it\u2019s like my Canadian university, you can\u2019t smoke on campus at all. So could be much worse.", "Wait how is smoking in general make you an ass when outside? I mean I will always look down on smoking anyway but I wanna know the arguement behind all of them being an ass (not saying they aren't or are).\n\nLast time I had an issue was this dude vaping in a class with no windows and told him to fuck off. Then it happend at McDonald's kid party. Idk but the lines is extremely blurred with vapers more it seems.", "Straight up one of the smartest men I know is also the dumbest.

It stinks. The smell lingers on your clothes, hair, and breath. How badly depends on how often you're doing it. It's why it's becoming a more common recommendation these days for parents to either request a smoker that visits change into a clean shirt, or they'll even provide one in their size to wear while visiting, that way baby doesn't get exposed as badly to third-hand smoke.", "idk why i got downvoted for asking someones honest opinion on what they said but ight", "Not noticing doesn't negate being an asshole.", "YTA but it is complete accidental since it is understandable you are tired from long tedious work. But your response isn\u2019t exactly good too when you accidentally blow bloke\u2019s face. Please Have some sympathy for his condition. Next time please be mindful of your surroundings and people. And why everyone are so fast to call u a insults. I thought that subreddit replies should be biased free and give very good points.", "Fellow Canadian PhD student who also enjoys smoking from time to time here - YTA. It's really not that difficult to look where you're blowing your smoke (and also not to smoke in doorways...)", ">I was smoking right next to the doors of the building, which is against campus rules.\n\nLiterally do not need to read further than this. I agree with his assessment of you that you've called an insult, and I'd like to add that YTA. Rules are there for a reason.", "Why would you do this?", "NTA. You apologized and he insulted you. You are getting all the YTA because you were smoking.", "Not a very sincere apology, was it? YTA. Excuse me, Mr. ABD. YT Privileged A.", "Yta, you were breaking the rules but he still had no need to swear at you. He could have being assertive.", "There's a reason you're not allowed to smoke near doors. YTA", "ESH.", "NTA because you didn't know he was there and apologized when you saw him, but it would have been smarter to let his comment go and say nothing. Things happen, though, so I can understand your response. Either way, lesson learned.", "YTA, being tired is not an excuse to be rude to others and break rules. And in general, if you're working so hard you are falling asleep smoking, you need to dial it down. I know it all feels very urgent (I have a STEM PhD), but it's a marathon, not a sprint.", "YTA for escalating when he called you a dumbfuck. Just apologize a second time and move away from the doors to avoid doing it again. Blowing smoke in his face was a genuine accident, so no y-t-a for that.", "Probably controversial ESH\n\nYou shouldn't smoke next to the building (it's a law not just the rules), but like you gotta be an idiot to stand next to someone you see smoking, with their eyes shut, and then be surprised when you breathe in smoke.\n\nYou also need to learn to de-escalate. No one should have had to call campus security. Just walk away.", "Bro I can\u2019t smoke on my campus so I always go to the park or HIDE SOMEWHERE and smoke. Weed is not legal everywhere so you\u2019re not very smart for smoking right next to a building.", "YTA.  The rules apply to you, too, even if you're tired.  It would be different if your story matches the post title.", "Just because you\u2019re tired doesn\u2019t mean you can act like a dick and not follow campus rules or common decency, even if it was an accident.

We get it. But now you're doubling down on being an asshole because someone is explaining WHY your second hand smoke is bad for them for *medical* reasons. And you attempt to somehow justify it with you \"high stress\" and \"having a bad day\" nonsense excuses. **Rationalizations why you're breaking rules and fouling up other people's clean air are not needed here.**\n\nYou have what is called Smokers Entitlement Syndrome. You feel that your \"need\" to smoke it up and fill other people's lungs with the crud you're inhaling is some god given right, and \"no big deal\". But it is a big deal. When my son's asthma gets triggered, it can lead to out-of-control coughing fits that lead to gagging and choking,  requiring emergency medical care. So yeah, *it's not a big deal to you*, but it's a big deal with people who can't medically tolerate your filthy particulate.\n\n**Keep it up though.
