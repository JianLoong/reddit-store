I got kinda pissed off at his insult (I was already pretty tense from a night of hard, tedious work), so I told him to piss off. Things got heated between us, and we kept escalating until we caught the attention of campus security (they were just doing some routine patrols).

Please accept my apology.\"\n\nYou know you should not have been there smoking.", "YTA. You did something wrong. A real apology is not contingent upon its acceptance or forgiveness for the action.

As a waitress, I can easily work up to 15 hours a day. It may not be saving lives, but it's incredibly exhausting on a physical, emotional, and mental stand point.

How did you *not* get any type of punishment? At least a slap on the wrist? He's there for his health and safety, not to be greeted by someone who doesn't care about what they're supposed to represent.\n\nI don't think you did this because your brain was fried and you were tired, it reads more like you didn't *care* and made the choice not to care. If you work at a hospital, you need to follow certain protocols, hold yourself to a high standard, and always - *always* - be aware of your surroundings and the people within it.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, if this happened with my grandpa who has to be on oxygen, I'd be ready to fight you and talking to whoever I needed to report to you to the higher ups.", "YTA.

No body likes smoke in their face so.. for you to get offended at being called a \u201cdumbfuck\u201d for your own Inconsiderate behaviour.. is pathetic.\n\nEdit: to add to this.. smoking is a choice and most of the time having a condition like asthma, is not. Again yta.", "YTA. You knowingly broke the rule (you being tired isn\u2019t an excuse) and blew smoke in someone\u2019s face, which is the exact reason the rule exists.

YTA.", "YTA. And a bigger one for not taking responsibility for your disgusting action.  Hope someone kicks your ass your behavior someday.", "YTA. If you did that to me or people like me you could have triggered an asthma attack. You were knowing breaking the rules and got pissed for being called out for it.

Rules.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nI'm a smoker. I also work hard labor 10-14 hours a day. Before that, I would work a very mentally demanding job for 12-18 hours a day.

Every smoker knows it'd illegal to smoke within 50ft of doorways. \n\nNow, let's say that one day, I am lazy and uncaring like OP, and I were to smoke right next to a door.

It's obviously unpleasant to have smoke blown into your face, but it's not like you did it on purpose, and there's no way you could've known about his condition. You did smoke in a place where it's forbidden though, so you could've just walked the few steps to go to a place where it's allowed. Walking helps clearing your head even better than a cigarette (former smoker here). \n\nBut his insult right off the bat was an overreaction which either makes him the other AH in this story, or he was having a similarly lousy day and felt the need to blow off steam - and it just happened to be at you. That doesn't make his behavior acceptable, but we've certainly all had a bad day and taken our temper out on someone who didn't deserve it (assuming we're generally civilized people who don't otherwise engage in AH behavior).", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

PhDinphysics is the name he chose for his account. Lol it\u2019s everywhere you look in this post that he is getting a PhD", "Now, now, come down off your high horse little buddy smoking in a private area away from others is a personal decision.", "It's weird how identifiable he made himself while using a throwaway. How many students from the UK are 26 year old smokers doing PhDs in physics at Canadian universities?", "Eh, it\u2019s in his username as well. It goes beyond using it as a base example for why he is tired and more of a brag at that point."]}
