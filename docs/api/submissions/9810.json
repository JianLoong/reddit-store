Maybe don\u2019t smoke right in front of an entrance next time.", "YTA.\n\nAs someone with a respiratory condition I would probably be pretty mad about someone blowing smoke in my face too. \n\nNext time, don\u2019t smoke near doorways people are going to be walking in and out of.", "I'm a smoker, YTA\n\nDon't smoke around public doors it's rude af", "YTA. I've been a PhD student in STEM and let me tell you it doesn't give you a random blank pass.", "Well... yeah.   YTA \n\nBroke the rules.  (They aren't only for people whose brains aren't fried.)   \n\nBlew smoke into someone's face albeit accidentally.   Nevertheless you continued the altercation that should have ended after your apology.   \n\nYou don't have to continue to engage when someone is arguing with you.   You were both tired and stressed.   But he was just walking down the hall and you were smoking where you shouldn't have been.", "Ah, so you worked SO hard rules and common decency no longer applied to you, and you just get to inconvenience everyone else because of it, got it. YTA, how could it be otherwise?", "Just cause you're doing a PhD doesn't mean you can't be a dumb fuck. You were a dumb fuck and you're insecure about your intelligence?\n\nI mean I assume that's why you had to give us all this useless backstory about you doing a PhD? \n\nYTA", "Smoking in an area where it isn\u2019t allowed makes YTA. Actually smoking at all these days makes you a little bit of an AH, but you could at least be considerate about it. Feeling tired is no excuse.", "YTA you did something against the rules, and then blew smoke in an unsuspecting individuals face and fortunately got away with a warning. Don\u2019t do it again, AH", "I think you already know YTA.\n\nYou seem to feel remorse when retelling the story, but when confronted for doing what you did, in a place you know is restricted from doing so, you decided to escalate the situation to save face instead of just saying what you are saying to everyone here to justify what you did. \"I'm sorry, I usually would not be smoking here, but I am just extremely tired from work and my brain is not functioning. Please accept my apology.\"\n\nYou know you should not have been there smoking.", "YTA. You did something wrong. A real apology is not contingent upon its acceptance or forgiveness for the action. So your apology was meaningless. Suck it up and next time if you do something you're not supposed to, accept the consequences - including social consequences.", "YTA you smoke there when it's against the rules and blowing into someone's face that's disgusting.", "YTA, for smoking in general, for smoking in a public area, again for smoking next to a door and again for not ensuring when doing both of those things, that you\u2019re not blowing smoke where someone else has to smell it.", "YTA\n\nAccidents happen, and if this was somewhere random that allowed smoking then I would say NTA, but in this case it's justified that YTA.\n\nYou know better than to smoke in front of hospital doors, regardless of how tired you are (in the U.S. there are laws saying you can't smoke within 100 feet of hospital entrances and exits or anywhere on campuses). As a waitress, I can easily work up to 15 hours a day. It may not be saving lives, but it's incredibly exhausting on a physical, emotional, and mental stand point. Even I know better than to smoke next to the doors and will put space between myself and the restaurant if there's no designated smoking area (like by the dumpsters or something).\n\nHe had every right to call you out on it, and the way you reacted was extremely unprofessional. How did you *not* get any type of punishment? At least a slap on the wrist? He's there for his health and safety, not to be greeted by someone who doesn't care about what they're supposed to represent.\n\nI don't think you did this because your brain was fried and you were tired, it reads more like you didn't *care* and made the choice not to care. If you work at a hospital, you need to follow certain protocols, hold yourself to a high standard, and always - *always* - be aware of your surroundings and the people within it.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, if this happened with my grandpa who has to be on oxygen, I'd be ready to fight you and talking to whoever I needed to report to you to the higher ups.", "YTA.  If you\u2019d done that to me, you literally could\u2019ve killed me.  At a minimum, it\u2019d mean a trip to the ER and a lousy night with my heart racing and my body shaking from the drugs needed to keep my lungs from closing.  Those rules exist for a reason, as does the basic courtesy of paying attention to where your smoke is going.  Maybe get yourself a vape to use when you\u2019re too knackered to be polite? It\u2019s a lot less troublesome to most folks, myself included.", "YTA. You\u2019re aware enough to realize smoking by the doors isn\u2019t allowed. As far as I know as a Canadian.. you have to be 9meters away from the doors to smoke. No body likes smoke in their face so.. for you to get offended at being called a \u201cdumbfuck\u201d for your own Inconsiderate behaviour.. is pathetic.", "YTA. You knowingly broke the rule (you being tired isn\u2019t an excuse) and blew smoke in someone\u2019s face, which is the exact reason the rule exists. Then you got aggressive with someone for telling you off. YTA twice.", "YTA. I smoked for a very long time and I *hated* smokers like you. Always lighting up where it's not allowed like the rules don't apply to you.", "YTA. Being tired doesn\u2019t give you a pass to break rules that are literally for the health/safety of others. Move farther from the building AND don\u2019t just move to a walkway that people use regularly. Don\u2019t make your smoke someone else\u2019s problem.", "God I hate med students, they could be a literal walking AH and still be like \u201cwell I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong\u201d\n\nYTA", "YTA. No one should have to explain this to you. You are self centered and arrogant to think the guy you chemically gassed isn't working as hard as yourself at Uni. You're also pretty self important to disregard the (legally established, important) smoking areas. Y are so much TA here.", "YTA a dumb mistake might be forgivable but escalating when you were the one who made the dumb mistake is not. You should have apologized.", "YTA. Listen, I get being stressed out. But you shouldn't smoke where you are not supposed to do so, and you should have just apologized again even if the dude called you a dumbfuck.", "So you were sleepy, did something dumb and harnful, didn't pay attention, broke rules, and were quite inconsiderate. Then you negligently blew smoke into someone's face, something you know to be very offensive and also harmful.\n\nWhen they called you a dumb fuck they didn't insult you, they described you.\n\nAnd then you had to insult them? YTA.", "YTA. And a bigger one for not taking responsibility for your disgusting action.  Hope someone kicks your ass your behavior someday.", "YTA. If you did that to me or people like me you could have triggered an asthma attack. You were knowing breaking the rules and got pissed for being called out for it. Campus security should have booted from the area.", "YTA. Jeez, someone going for a PhD should know not to smoke, or at the very least the places where smoking is illegal.", "YTA. Rules.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nI'm a smoker. I also work hard labor 10-14 hours a day. Before that, I would work a very mentally demanding job for 12-18 hours a day. I've never been so \"tired\" that I couldn't walk my lazy ass to the smoking area. Every smoker knows it'd illegal to smoke within 50ft of doorways. \n\nNow, let's say that one day, I am lazy and uncaring like OP, and I were to smoke right next to a door. If someone called me an asshole, they would be right, and I wouldn't take it as an insult since it was more of an observation anyway.", "You are so obviously the AH, I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t already know that. \n\nYTA", "As a smoker YTA.", "ESH. You did what you weren\u2019t supposed to, although you were apologetic. The rule is probably there for this exact reason. You don\u2019t know what condition he has. He was a bit prick about your mistake, apology included. You probably should\u2019ve just taken the rude remark though. You\u2019re both kinda idiots in this situation, no offense. Just learn from it.", "ESH. It's obviously unpleasant to have smoke blown into your face, but it's not like you did it on purpose, and there's no way you could've known about his condition. You did smoke in a place where it's forbidden though, so you could've just walked the few steps to go to a place where it's allowed. Walking helps clearing your head even better than a cigarette (former smoker here). \n\nBut his insult right off the bat was an overreaction which either makes him the other AH in this story, or he was having a similarly lousy day and felt the need to blow off steam - and it just happened to be at you. That doesn't make his behavior acceptable, but we've certainly all had a bad day and taken our temper out on someone who didn't deserve it (assuming we're generally civilized people who don't otherwise engage in AH behavior).", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are speaking as if you\u2019ve never made a mistake in your life.", "Yeah I'd say ESH with a lean towards OP being the bigger one.", "That's just not true.
