Are they trying to manipulate you?\n\nHard NTA.", "NTA, it\u2019s not like you said \u201ckids come down here I want to tell you something.

That's so fucked up.\n\nAs someone here said, it seems all your kids want is to pick a fight. You have no good option and no matter what you say, they will find a reason to say you don't care.\n\nThe main issue here is that, they believe you don't care about them. They think you care more about your remote family (the fact that you plan to retire in your home country when you're old, is a sign of abandonment for them). You need some family therapy.", "NTA\n\nThey asked you about being childfree and would you mind - you said you respect their decision and hope they have the lives that they want.\n\nThen your children got upset with the answer.  That bit is a little strange.\n\nIt is almost like they wanted another reaction from you.  Maybe it was a weird type of test however you gave a correct answer.  It is THEIR life and it is THEIR choice.  They are adults and you are letting them choose their own path.\n\nIs it possible they have some unresolved jealousy as their mother loves your grandchildren?", "NTA, your kids should be grateful they have a supportive father who respects their life choices. Even if you already having grandchildren has influenced your mindset on them giving you grand children, that's a win for them because it takes the pressure off them.", "NTA, it seems like they are looking for some kind of attention.

But you did the right thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you are giving them attention and showing them love. If they haven\u2019t wanted to come on trips to your home country since they were 13, perhaps they feel abandoned every time you go?

And when it didn\u2019t happen\u2026 they were surprised enough to feel indignant..?\n\nMy best guess. Regardless, you\u2019re NTA for sure.", "NTA. They said what they plan to do, you said \u201cOK,\u201d and now they want to be angry at your reaction. I think the plan was that you would complain about no grandkids so they could complain that you don\u2019t respect their choice. But since you DO respect their choice, they came up with another reason to be angry.  Let it go, they\u2019re looking for problems/attention.\n\nDo they live at home with you?", "huh? NTA looks to me like drama baiting. They wanted some emotional response but you gave them a understanding response telling them that they should do what will make them happy. Many kids wish they could be that lucky.   \n\n\nMaybe? Your tone was dismissive and uncaring? Short of them just trying to bait an emotional response that's the only reason I can think of.

To resolve this and set better foundations for the rest of your guys\u2019 relationship I\u2019d consider sitting them down again and say you were reflecting on the conversation and wanted them to know you love and care about them.

They acted like it was a *right* of theirs that I was stripping away from them, and they got more upset by the fact that I didn't feel \"empathy for their plight\" because I was unapologetic about it. Basically I felt like an incubator and not their daughter.\n\nThe only thing I can theorize about your kid's reaction is that they took your reaction as you saying \"I already have grandkids, yours wouldn't have mattered anyways so no loss there\" sort of thing, and that probably freaked them out. I mean I don't know if there's some underlying reason as to why they felt that way (like maybe they've always been compared to your oldest) or if it's all in their heads, but regardless, in this specific situation they are in the wrong.", "NTA.

What were you supposed to do, argue with them and tell them that you expect them to have children? \n\nPerhaps it was an issue of the exact verbage or something, but it sounds like they\u2019re lookin for a fight.

Maybe they resent you wanting to retire closer to him than to them?\n\nThe only other thing I can think of is the nature of your reaction. My wife has Aspergers Syndrome and her emotional reactions are very muted compared to neurotypical people. It's very easy to mistake her lack of outward emotion for a lack of caring.

Clearly they assumed that a parent who really loved them would care about having grandchildren from them, and by saying you were ok with it, they read into it that you do not care about them. I think saying that you realize by not having grandchildren through them, there are certain special events and milestones you won\u2019t get to celebrate with them, and that you want to be sure to celebrate others. Ask them what milestones they will want to celebrate because you want to know what is important to them.", "Two independent individuals who made the same \u201cmonumental decision\u201d and collaborated to announce it at the same time smells like them looking for a fight.

There\u2019s probably a reason these kids wanted to have it out.\n\nI\u2019d say ESH", "Exactly.  You don't just announce unprompted that you aren't going to have children.  The story is missing the reason the kids felt the need to say it, so either side or both could be at fault for whatever led up to this.

Your parents planning to leave you behind and uproot their lives is a big deal, not least because they both still live in the family home. \n\nThey could have been hoping that when their parents retire, they were planning to spend plenty of time coming back and visiting their assumed US grandkids, and actually put effort into the relationship with their younger kids - it\u2019s hard to maintain close family ties long distance.\n\nBut OP has basically said \u201cnah, don\u2019t care\u201d.

Did anything suspicious happen?", "NTA, this is very lovely and supportive. but after some time to cool off, you might want to open lines of communication to discover why they reacted so strongly and see how you can repair whatever they think is broken about the relationship. sometimes kids get something in their head about their parents and then just live with it without realizing it was sourced from childhood perspective and not reality.\n\nalso, use enby, not NB. NB already means non-black.", "INFO: I want to lean toward n t a but I have to wonder at the family dynamic.  You mention the oldest grandchild is 13 and you and your wife travel a lot to see them and you've always supported your son and intend to retire where your oldest lives.   You are n t a for your response but I highly suspect your two younger kids feel like you show favoritism towards their brother. You've already told them you're retiring to another country which is fine but how long have you been saying this? Have they heard it since they were teens? I get the feeling a teen hearing this might feel \"dad is far more interested in his grandkids than having any part in our adult lives.\" While your kids were minors did you take them on various small vacations or were most of the trips during their teen years spent seeing your grandkids.  \n\nIt's likely your kids are reacting our of some kind of jealousy or feeling like you care more for your oldest and your grandkids than you do for them.", "NTA", "NTA so you said you accept whatever makes them happy and they are upset with that?

I was unhappy with the plans of my father, too, when he isolated from me with my stepmom. He used to show preference to his older daughter with kids over me, and I am childfree. They would do things for my sister and her family, like give more expensive gifts and visit. I don't actually lash out on him like your family did, but it does get me in my feelings sometimes. Perhaps your younger children feel the same way I do- like you are OK retiring with your other parts of your family and leaving them behind.", "NTA.  \nThey were honest with you, and you were honest with them.  \nThey apparently weren't expecting unwavering support in their decision.  \n\"Dad, we don't want kids.\"  \n\"Okay  I don't want to feel pressured to do something just because you think I expect it\"\n\"HoW dArE yOu\"  \nThat's actually  pretty amusing.", "NTA\n\nYour reaction and justification sound logical and actually very supportive.\nThe problem is I think that them announcing that they would not be giving you grandchildren was also a test; perhaps they wanted you to want grandchildren from them, much like you would have wished grandchildren from oldest son had he not had any already.\n\nI think your youngest two may still have some deeply buried insecurities about how you feel about them. Good luck sorting that out...", "NTA.  Based on who your second litter of kids are, they thrive on discord and finding silly things to feel persecuted over.

At least you have one child you can be proud of.", "NTA \nThe fact that they came to you together to unform you that neither of them are planning on having kids is weird, they're siblings, not a couple.

Unless there's more to this story?", "NTA but have you considered the possibility they say they don't want kids to provoke a reaction from you? Apparently their mother being really upset made them feel really good, so attention seeking is the likely explanation there. \n\nAlso, the fact you have a relationship with your older child and his kids may have caused jealousy from your younger 2. \n\nIt's a lose-lose situation. React, they'll say you are disrespecting their choice. Don't react, you're an emotionless AH. \n\nIf you're planning to retire to your home country, the way they are thinking, they probably see it as you abandoning them \"because they do'nt want kids\". It's easy to feel like the victim at that age, but there isn't much you can do about them being both jealous and uninterested", "NTA. You can't win here.   \nIf you had kicked off about them not wanting kids, crying, begging pleading etc. then they would have been upset because you were trying to push them into something they didn't want to do and forcing your opinions on them.", "They weren't looking for acceptance...they were looking for attention and you didnt respond the way they wanted.", "Your kids with your wife have the best of every world. You respect their decision be childfree and they don't have to feel guilty fot not providing GCs because you already have them. What exactly is their problem? The world doesn't revolve around anyone's reproductive choices... This is such a non issue.", "I can maybe offer a little bit of perspective.\n\nAdults in their mid twenties, particularly women, are expected by the majority of society to both love and dote over children, and to want to have their own. If we don\u2019t, many people see us as being morally wrong and can even get angry. \n\nI\u2019ve interacted with complete strangers that get irrationally upset because I mention I don\u2019t have the desire to raise or even be around children. You get called selfish, blamed for the downfall of society even, etc.. People even write whole [articles](https://www.yourtango.com/family/childless-by-choice-women-big-part-society-deterioration?amp) bashing the choices of childfree women. \n\nThe point of saying all this is to note that being childfree is technically an alternative lifestyle, which garners a lot of hate from some people. It\u2019s becoming *much* more accepted recently, but it\u2019s still a risk to tell people\u2014 especially your parents, that you\u2019re childfree. They may reject you, they may chastise you. It\u2019s almost akin to coming out. \n\nIf I had to guess, they were expecting anger or disappointment on your end, but were still hoping for love and acceptance. This was obviously a big deal to them to tell you this, and you not having a significant reaction probably threw them off and definitely upset them a little bit. \n\nI wont say y t a because there\u2019s absolutely no way you could have known this. You\u2019re not a mind reader and you can\u2019t know what outcome or words of affirmation they wanted to hear from you. \n\nBut I also dont fault your daughters. Even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it, this was important to them. They wanted to hear \u201cI love and accept you\u201d, but heard \u201cThat\u2019s fine, I dont really mind.\u201d Their reaction is confusing and misdirected, but understandable. \n\nMy vote then is NAH.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t actually say you don\u2019t care because you already have a bunch of grandchildren, your attitude is more of a \u201cyou do you\u201d attitude where you just want your kids to do what makes them happy, and you\u2019re okay with them not having kids if they don\u2019t want to. That\u2019s exactly the type of supportive attitude I wish I got from my parents. It\u2019s honestly kind of bizarre that your kids are upset about it.", "NTA. What were they hoping to get from you there? What kind of trap was that on their parts?", "Wtf lmao", "NTA Sounds like they were looking for a reaction for attention. Attention seeking is annoying but usually children do it because they don\u2019t feel they are a priority but your kids are in the 20s I\u2019m not really sure what else you could of done.", "NTA. \n\nKids: Dad, we don\u2019t want to have children \nOP: that\u2019s fine, I support your decisions\nKids: Wow. So you didn\u2019t even want us to be born huh?\n\nIt\u2019s effed up that they WANTED you to be sad and that your acceptance made them angry. What kind of backwards ass logic is that??", "NTA.

Sounds like that was a lose-lose conversation, because if you would have given the different response, they most likely would have accused you of being unsupportive. .Also, they might not think the same way after some years and may reverse their decision to have children. It's not like that was any sort of binding declaration anyhow. Don't worry about it.", "OP Damned if you do damned if you don\u2019t.", "NTA.

I said I didn't want kids at that age too. (Guess what, I now have kids.) It strikes me as strange they announced this together, plus talked to you and your wife separately. Smells likes emotional blackmail.", "NTA nobody should assume everyone wants kids. Some people are infertile, some people are tokophobic, some people literally don't deserve kids.\n\nWe have passed 8 billion people on a planet with finite resources that we have brutalised since the start of the industrial revolution.\n\nIf you genuinely want kids because you want to raise a human, give them support and watch them flourish then great! Do that I love to see it.\n\nIf you're just doing it because \"I want something to love me\" \"I need someone to take care of me when I'm old\" \"They're an investment\" (a dumb investment)  \"I wanna dress it up in little feety pajamas\" \"It's just what you're supposed to do\" \"I'm trying to fix my relationship\" \"I'm bored\" \"I want *insert gender here*\" please don't. The kid doesn't deserve that, your basicallybirthing it with expectations it may never acheive and it breeds neglect and negativity which can affect that child their entire life. Get therapy and really think about it because you can't just shove it back in if you decide it's not for you. You can quit a job, sell a house/business you can't un-have a child.\n\nI'm not having children despite being great with them because I don't like being around children and it's not selfish, it's selfless. I may be putting my needs above someone that doesn't exsist, but they're not being affected by it because they don't exsist. I would argue that going against my self awareness and doing it because I've been told to is more selfish because I'm literally only thinking of appeasing people who won't help me and won't give a shit about me just to shut them up.

That has more to do with them than you.\n\nOne of my kids has an alternative lifestyle. That child chose to have kids. My kids who have stereotypical lifestyles do not. It's not that hard.

Especially when we live in a time where birth control and abortion are so controversial/hot topics. Lots of ways it can come up.", "I agree with you. I also wonder if these kids have heard/seen so many dramatic stories about conflict around 'coming out' style announcements that they were braced for that and then didn't know how to handle it when OP genuinely said he loves them not matter what. \n\nAny reasonable parent would believe and support a child who says they don't want to have children. I mean, why would you wish a lifelong commitment on someone who doesn't want it?", "To chime in with another experience, when I came out to my brother he responded with literally \u201cyeah okay, whatever.\u201d This was really hurtful to me at the moment and I remember how it felt like my heart dropped down to my shoes because it was something I\u2019d been so scared to do, really opening myself up and making myself vulnerable to him like that.

I'm glad you know what you want and live the way you want to!\") and turn it into something you didn't say at all. My guess is, that there is something else behind this that hasn't that much to do with you. You sound like a wonderful father and a person that lives with integrety and respects other peoples rights to make their own decision. \n\n- One idea would be, that they have been harbouring resentment/jealousy against your grandchildren for a long time (I don't know why, obviously) and this is just their way of expressing it. Maybe they don't even realize that that's what they are doing. \n\n- Another idea would be, that they *do* want to have children at some point, but are not honest about it to themselves (its *really* easy to lie to yourself/such realizations often take a lot of time. And/or they might think (/assume/fear) that there is no really safe/good way to have kids because of their gender identity and sexual orientation. The fear of homophobia etc. is obviously completely valid. Maybe they are sad about this without realizing it. And you not pushing back against their declaration just made it feel \"real\", that they won't try having kids. Maybe actually admitting that one of them would actually *want* kinds of their own would be too painful, because they feel its too difficult/not possible to have kids anway. And so telling themselves and you that they don't want it is easier to deal with. And anger is often a less difficult emotion than sadness.\n\nOf course this is all speculation. What I am trying to say is: Feelings around these topics are complicated. And it's really difficult to find out what one actually wants.\n\n- One other thing that might be behind this could be: It's more about feeling *actually* seen and valued by you than about anything else. Maybe with regards to their gender identity/sexual orientation? Its really wonderful you accept them! (I'm non-binary myself) But it could be the difference between you saying \"I don't care, I still love them.\" and \"It matters to me that they are NB and lesbian and I love them both in their truest identity, especially.\" I know that is a small diference, and maybe that is what you already do (*or: not what they would want anyways!!*). But that was an additional idea. \n\nSorry this is so long. I changed my mind a few times about wanting kids (I don't), and had to fight to find out, what I actually want. Plus I'm non-binary and queer, so ....yeah, there were a few things that might be possible in my eyes.\n\nThe bottom line is: Try talking to them. Tell them, that you *do* care again, and ask them what they want from you. And maybe try asking if there are other things/feelings they weren't open about over the years.\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nETA: fear of loosing you and your wife as parents, fear of loosing the connection you have as a family could be another thing behind this. There is a country they don't like and don't go to, there are grandchildren they don't know anymore and you and your wife have gone there many times, leaving them behind (no judgement on my part, just summarizing). *And* you are planning on retiring there! The thing all these factors have in common is: You prioritize this other place and those other people over them, even planning on living there permanently. Staying near the place your younger two kids live doesn't seem to be Important to you.

I would have imagined that you and your wife would be of similar mindsets and would have had similar responses to the kids broaching the subject. Also, I'm wondering why they talked to each of you separately, instead of one conversation with both you and your wife.

My personal opinion is that this is how they feel/are and my love for/opinion of them would not change one bit and my instinct would be to simply say, \"it doesn't matter\" to me \"what\" you are, I still love you just the way you are. I find it very distressing that I could be considered an asshole for such a response. I understand that coming out comes with a lot of stress, fear, anxiety, etc. and that it can be very traumatic for some people and that you probably all have a version of event in your head where you imagined all possible scenarios but for someone who doesn't deal with any of these emotions/fear, we cannot possibly be expected to react exactly the way you imagined it in your mind! If someone tells you it doesn't matter to them, depending on the tone they use, I would expect it to be clear that what is meant is that it doesn't change our opinion of who you are. Give people a chance to express themselves fully once they react. If they say \"it doesn't matter\" maybe pry a little and ask them to explain further. Is it that they don't give a shit about you or is it more likely that your coming out doesn't diminish their love for you? However, I will admit that if someone comes out to me one day, I will keep all these reactions in mind and express myself as thoroughly as possible.

Idk if they even know what they are missing/ wanting from you but I'd take this opportunity to open that conversation & really listen when they tell you.", "NTA anyway you look at it. But in my opinion, \"not planning on having kids\" does not mean the same thing as \"I don't want to have children\". Was there any discussion about you supporting them if they wanted to do surrogacy or adoption or in vitro? I'm wondering if they were looking for support. Like if the conversation was like, \"I support your decision not to have children but if you do want children, I'm here to support you in any possible way\" or if it was more like \"you don't want to have kids, that's cool\". \n\nIt's not clear if there was prior talk about grandchildren like if they felt pressured about having kids and that's why they felt like they needed to sit down with you. \n\nEither way, you're still affirming their choices so their response is a little weird. Did Mom get the same response from them?", "NTA you give them respect, what more could they ask for?", "NTA.\n\nOP respected and supported their decisions like a good parent should.  They're complaining about that?", "NTA. I've had acquaintances like your children and people like this annoy me. Idrc that you are lesbian or NB and neither does anyone else, enjoy your sexuality in private like the rest of us. They probably wanted to have a special moment and were mad you reacted normally without contest. Just let them be sad that their sexuality isn't really that impactful and move on.", "NTA. You can\u2019t win them all, especially when their expectations are not grounded in reality.", "NTA -  Nothing you said or did was wrong!  Your younger children sound a bit self-absorbed, tho.  Like why did they think them not having children would shatter your world?  Maybe ask them what reaction they wanted/expected?  Dig a bit deeper?", "Definitely NTA", "NTA. What? Plenty of childfree people would love having a parent that doesn't have constant looming expectations of grandchildren. Did they want you to get upset and demand they make some babies? What's not to love about immediate acceptance?", "NTA\n\nA choice is a choice.", "Only thing I can think of is that they built up this expectation in their mind about how upset you would be and when you didn\u2019t behave that way, they took it as a sign of your lack of regard rather than your wealth of respect for them. Time to have another sit down conversation with them about it. NTA.", "NTA - And your children should count their blessings! The sheer number of kids who are pressured to produce kids is insane.", "Your kids fucking suck ass.", "NTA. You were telling them that you would respect their choices as adults. That\u2019s exactly what a parent should say. It seems like they wanted to trap you in some no-win situation. \n\nIf you had said, you were disappointing, you really want grand children you would\u2019ve been called controlling. You weren\u2019t going to win either way. They just need to mature some.", "NTA - sounds like they were trying to get a rise out of you and they didn't get it. I'm not sure *why* they want a rise out of you about this. \n\nI don't have a pile of grandkids and I support my kids when they say they probably aren't having kids. It's their choice.", "NTA\n\nIt looks like they tried to entrap you, and are upset that you didn't fall on the trap.", "NTA weird reaction from the kids. My son told me he doesn't want kids because him likes his freedom and I said ok. It's he's decision.", "NTA there was no way you could have come out of this situation looking good in their eyes. They wanted something to fight about and are now grasping at straws.", "NTA!! \n\nAlso an Ohio-an!! Small world\n\nO-H", "nta your kids are dramatic and need attention", "NTA \n\nYour kids resent their older brother though and that's pretty clear. So maybe try to start there and see why they feel this way.", "NTA. Your 2 kids sound spoiled. You\u2019re the dream parent for a lot of kids out there who can\u2019t be themselves out of pure fear of their parents rejecting them, disowning them and possibly harming them. Also they seem to look down on your home country which is nuts to me\u2026 however I\u2019m glad to hear your relationship with your son and his mother is great and that you visit him and the kids regularly enough that your wife is now a bonus grandma to them. I\u2019d say you\u2019ve done a great job at being a dad and done all you can especially on the support front.", "NTA- Sounds like they were baiting you", "NTA! So many people have kids because they think it\u2019s expected of them and that\u2019s how bad things happen to all these children born to parents who weren\u2019t prepared to be parents. Normalize being child free. Not everyone is meant to breed.", "NTA\nYour kids are just looking for drama", "NTA.  Don't twist yourself in knots trying to understand their reasoning.  If they feel guilty on their mother's account, they need to deal with it or change their minds.  Your daughter can get a sperm donor once/if she is at a place in her life that she want kids.  Even NB kid could their mind (although I don't know what route take - an NB with a uterus or adoption - OH, what brave new world is this!)  If they think you should be more upset because of your wife, how is this going to make anyone happy?  Sit down with your kids and wife and get feelings out in the open.", "NTA.\n\nI wonder if your children are a little jealous of their older brother and the time you spend traveling to see him and his children. They were expecting you to be as upset as your wife. The question is, why do they want you to be upset? They wanted that response from you and are upset that you didn't react the way your wife did. Sounds like some family therapy might get to the bottom of what they want from you.", "NTA. . . and I'm very confused.   \n\n\nI'm getting the feeling that they are looking to provoke. . . one of those \"even bad attention is better than no attention\" types.", "This, I honestly don\u2019t get the issue here. They want to be child free. He is ok with it. I have many child free friends where the parents aren\u2019t so ok with it and that has caused tension. From my understanding most people prefer to have parents who respect their decisions in adult life.\nNTA.", "It could be seen as he really wouldn't care about any kids they had because he already has plenty of grandkids. I think they're reading this less of support for their choices, more of favoritism for current grandchildren and son who has them. Aka, they don't matter cause he already got what he wanted. I don't think OP intended it like this, but depending on phrasing, it could have come off this way.", "Yeah. I was NOT expecting it to be the kids who don\u2019t want children to be the ones upset. I am still sitting here confused AF. \n\nWeRe they just testing him? And if he had reacted differently they probably would have said he is controlling and misogynistic. \n\nOp is definitely NTA.", "Right? How dare he be supportive of their decision? NTA", "It's because feeling oppressed and mistreated is trendy, especially among the circles the kids likely hang out in.  Having someone react to their attempts at attention-grabbing with \"ok, cool, I love you anyway\" means they don't get to oppression points they were trying to get and that's made them upset.", "To me it screams that there are underlying issues with the older brother. OP says he was huge in his oldest life but somehow his other two kids weren't really ever part of it, and stopped being a part at all in middle or high school? Definitely sounds like they think there are favoritism issues at play, percueces or real.", "Yes, exactly. These two kids just want (perhaps crave) attention. Then they got mad they didn\u2019t get the reaction they wanted.", "All your advice is just \"give them money\". They're adults. You don't get special prizes just for not plopping out a baby.", "When you even suggest that sub may be struggling with toxicity you are gonna get a whole hissy fit and a half there... And I'm very much child free.", "My sister does this a lot. She creates situation where she can be a victim and gets to lash out on anyone who doesn't play the part she wrote for them in her head.", "I wish more people reacted like this when I said I don't have and don't want kids tbh.", "I lurk in some of the online childfree By choice spaces bc it\u2019s just\u2026 honestly some of the people in them are kind of mind boggling in their main character syndrome, victim status craving, and refusal to believe people who make other choices can be happy or can understand and be happy for them. I\u2019m wondering if they bought into that warped us vs them mindset.", "This is probably the most sane comment I've seen on this entire thread.", "> I shouldn't celebrate it bc it was \"inconsiderate to women with fertility issues.\"\n\nhow tf do ppl come up w/ this shit?", "Haha yeah there is definitely a world view out there, that's for sure.", "That\u2019s a really good point. I think it\u2019s normal for some kids to resent others for perceived disparity in time/money/etc (resources, as you say). It is unfortunate that this has snowballed into something hurtful instead of it being something they got over as they grew up.", "Yes but it was still their choice to stop visiting so I think any feeling of being abandoned aren\u2019t really valid. I was an extremely difficult and jaded teenager even I would have been excited to go on vacation to a foreign country and get to be the \u201ccool uncle\u201d to a bunch of little kids.", "I don\u2019t think that is clear at all. A few trips to see his eldest son a year doesn\u2019t automatically mean he is ignoring the kids he lives with the vast majority of the time. His younger two may feel neglected if they are staying with grandparents while he takes these trips with mum. The younger two may feel it is unfair if they have missed out on, for example, a sports game or science fair of theirs if it coincided with a planned trip. But I\u2019m guessing here as that info was not given. He could have been a terrible father or an excellent one. We don\u2019t know. Based on the information only in the post, they need a little more attention but also need to grow up.", "why did you feel like you had to tell us their agab if they are nonbinary it seems unnecessary information", "Snowflake is used to describe anyone sensitive. What are you even talking about?", "I\u2019m gonna assume they refer to it as flyover country?", "As someone that lives in PA, Michigan does suck", "Some people only hear what they want to hear. Always and forever.", "This. When my nephew came out to me I was basically like \u201cok I already knew that\u201d bc I had pretty much seen he was likely to be when he was 3 and the older he got the more he showed that\u2019s who he was. In my mind that was an acceptable reaction but the look on his face clearly told me I dropped the ball. He and I have always been super close but he became extremely distant for a while after that. Took a lot of work on my part to make it up to him and now he sees that I wasn\u2019t dismissing who he is just that I wasn\u2019t at all surprised by the news.\n\nSounds like something similar happened here. It\u2019s likely unintentional and thus I think OP is NTA but it\u2019s something that needs to be properly addressed to mend hurt feelings.", "NTA. And ill go with you on that. They were looking for a fight or Op \"was dismissive in the way he said it\". Really weid reaction.", "I have no idea, but I was thoroughly gobsmacked by it.", "I don't know all the rules man.", "They do.   They want to live on the coasts. I like it here.", ">\"I told them that I respect their decision and that I hope they have the lives they want.\"\n\nHow the hell did you jump to this conclusion? Not the least bit supported.", "Yep I\u2019d bet this is it. Who plans a meeting with their parent to officially \u201ccome out\u201d about not wanting to have kids? They\u2019re also in their early 20s so I doubt they\u2019re getting pestered with the \u201cwhen are you going to settle down\u2026\u201d questions by family members yet.\n\nThis would never be necessary unless you come from a very conservative and/or religious family where having children is just assumed after marriage. Considering OP seems to be fully accepting of their non-binary and lesbian children I seriously doubt this is the case.", ">.but I do wonder if OP is one of those fathers who didn't take a lot of interest in his current children's lives but appeared very interested in his other son's life and THAT'S why they responded the way they did. Otherwise this makes no sense.\n\nThis post is definitely missing information and I tend to err against the person not providing enough information.  \n\nAs posted, OP is Not The Asshole.  But his kids don't like or aren't interested in their older brother?  Don't go on free trips out of the country?  Even the kid's choice of words \"emotionless asshole\" is telling.  I wouldn't be surprised if the older son is the favored son, while the two younger children feel neglected or ignored by their father.  \n\nBut again, this is reading a lot into a post that's missing too much information to judge accurately.  I expect the kid's version would be very different from the father's.", "It's this. They had a whole narrative planned in their heads where dad blew a gasket about their big announcement, and they got to add more \"trauma\" to their victim points tally.\n\nWhen he reacted supportively and lovingly and reasonably, they missed out on getting to be so stunning and brave with their big reveal on TikTok.", "I see where you are coming from but coming out is SOOOO different than saying you aren\u2019t planning on having kids.", "When friends came out to me, I used to say something along the lines of \"it didn't matter,\" then stumble around trying to say something that clarified that our relationship was unchanged by that information. It was always very awkward, and I finally realized that \"it doesn't matter\" sounded dismissive of something that affected their lives a LOT. \n\nSo I switched to saying \"I am honored that you trust me enough to share that with me.\" Because I did feel honored when someone trusted me enough to be their authentic selves in a society that is not always supportive.", "Not directed at you in particular because a bunch of people are doing it. STOP COMPARING COMING OUT to telling parents you don\u2019t want kids. The difference between the two is the size of the Grand Canyon", "I really hope OP sees this because I think it is the best comment. If I had an award to give you I would", "But this isn't a coming out, it's just talking about children. Why tf do they think it's normal for parents to get upset with their children for not having kids? They should be over the moon! Wife is an AH for reacting the way she did.", "If they\u2019ve been radicalized by someplace like the childfree subreddit, they\u2019ve been brainwashed into thinking their reproductive status is the  most important and interesting thing about them.", "EXACTLY!! He did the opposite and they GOT SHUT ALL THE WAY DOWN!!! Now go head and lick your wounds.  Please...", "The need for the implied parts to be said out loud seems to vary a lot from person to person. My husband and I have found that a lot of our miscommunications boil down to me badly wanting him to say things out loud, and him preferring to express them with actions (e.g. I would like to hear, \"Wow, I see that you worked really hard today getting everything ready for traveling with the baby! Thank you for taking care of all of that--it is going to make the trip so much smoother.\" He would like to make me a delicious dinner and say no words.) \n\nI think that especially with kids/teens/adolescents, it's hard to go wrong with saying things directly instead of leaving them implied. The ability to pick up on those implications can take time and skill to develop, and it can hurt when leaving things *unsaid* also means leaving them *unreceived*.", "They\u2019ve probably been fretting about it for a long time and wanted to talk about it together in case things went south. \n\nThe only weird bit is that it seems they wanted things to go badly. But in general LGBT siblings protecting each other like this isn\u2019t odd.", "Yeah. No hate to some of these commenters but the ones bending over backwards trying to find a way the father may have mishandled it seem odd. \n\nOkkums razor The kids are young and probably wanted drama.", "Yeah, the \"we already knew\" was super undermining when I came out. Spent years trying to figure out who I was and then working up to coming out, only to be told someone else had already known. I didn't know, so how come you did? \n\nAnd I was in a conservative high school - I had homophobic teachers. I feared for my safety, and hearing \"Oh we knew you're kinda obvious\" is super scary? The town where I went to high school - just 2 years ago a couple of the guys I was in school with got convicted of murder - they'd beaten a young gay kid to death, because he was gay. Those were guys in my class when I was in school 11 years ago. Like, one wrong step and I may have been that gay kid.", "literally same. I was 13 when I told my mom I was bi. she said \"i know I was waiting for you to tell me!\" I was not scared to come out perse, I knew I was attracted to anyone regardless of gender since I was a little kid. It was not this big revelation for me, rather I didnt think anything of it! My parents are very supportive and open minded."]}
