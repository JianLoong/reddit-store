Are they trying to manipulate you?\n\nHard NTA.", "NTA, it\u2019s not like you said \u201ckids come down here I want to tell you something.

That's so fucked up.\n\nAs someone here said, it seems all your kids want is to pick a fight. You have no good option and no matter what you say, they will find a reason to say you don't care.\n\nThe main issue here is that, they believe you don't care about them. They think you care more about your remote family (the fact that you plan to retire in your home country when you're old, is a sign of abandonment for them). You need some family therapy.", "NTA\n\nThey asked you about being childfree and would you mind - you said you respect their decision and hope they have the lives that they want.\n\nThen your children got upset with the answer.  That bit is a little strange.\n\nIt is almost like they wanted another reaction from you.  Maybe it was a weird type of test however you gave a correct answer.  It is THEIR life and it is THEIR choice.  They are adults and you are letting them choose their own path.\n\nIs it possible they have some unresolved jealousy as their mother loves your grandchildren?", "NTA, your kids should be grateful they have a supportive father who respects their life choices. Even if you already having grandchildren has influenced your mindset on them giving you grand children, that's a win for them because it takes the pressure off them.", "NTA, it seems like they are looking for some kind of attention.

But you did the right thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you are giving them attention and showing them love. If they haven\u2019t wanted to come on trips to your home country since they were 13, perhaps they feel abandoned every time you go?

And when it didn\u2019t happen\u2026 they were surprised enough to feel indignant..?\n\nMy best guess. Regardless, you\u2019re NTA for sure.", "NTA. They said what they plan to do, you said \u201cOK,\u201d and now they want to be angry at your reaction.

But since you DO respect their choice, they came up with another reason to be angry.  Let it go, they\u2019re looking for problems/attention.\n\nDo they live at home with you?", "huh? NTA looks to me like drama baiting. They wanted some emotional response but you gave them a understanding response telling them that they should do what will make them happy. Many kids wish they could be that lucky.   \n\n\nMaybe? Your tone was dismissive and uncaring? Short of them just trying to bait an emotional response that's the only reason I can think of.

To resolve this and set better foundations for the rest of your guys\u2019 relationship I\u2019d consider sitting them down again and say you were reflecting on the conversation and wanted them to know you love and care about them.

They acted like it was a *right* of theirs that I was stripping away from them, and they got more upset by the fact that I didn't feel \"empathy for their plight\" because I was unapologetic about it. Basically I felt like an incubator and not their daughter.\n\nThe only thing I can theorize about your kid's reaction is that they took your reaction as you saying \"I already have grandkids, yours wouldn't have mattered anyways so no loss there\" sort of thing, and that probably freaked them out. I mean I don't know if there's some underlying reason as to why they felt that way (like maybe they've always been compared to your oldest) or if it's all in their heads, but regardless, in this specific situation they are in the wrong.", "NTA.

What were you supposed to do, argue with them and tell them that you expect them to have children? \n\nPerhaps it was an issue of the exact verbage or something, but it sounds like they\u2019re lookin for a fight.

Maybe they resent you wanting to retire closer to him than to them?\n\nThe only other thing I can think of is the nature of your reaction. My wife has Aspergers Syndrome and her emotional reactions are very muted compared to neurotypical people. It's very easy to mistake her lack of outward emotion for a lack of caring.

Clearly they assumed that a parent who really loved them would care about having grandchildren from them, and by saying you were ok with it, they read into it that you do not care about them. I think saying that you realize by not having grandchildren through them, there are certain special events and milestones you won\u2019t get to celebrate with them, and that you want to be sure to celebrate others. Ask them what milestones they will want to celebrate because you want to know what is important to them.", "Two independent individuals who made the same \u201cmonumental decision\u201d and collaborated to announce it at the same time smells like them looking for a fight.

There\u2019s probably a reason these kids wanted to have it out.\n\nI\u2019d say ESH", "Exactly.  You don't just announce unprompted that you aren't going to have children.  The story is missing the reason the kids felt the need to say it, so either side or both could be at fault for whatever led up to this.

Your parents planning to leave you behind and uproot their lives is a big deal, not least because they both still live in the family home. \n\nThey could have been hoping that when their parents retire, they were planning to spend plenty of time coming back and visiting their assumed US grandkids, and actually put effort into the relationship with their younger kids - it\u2019s hard to maintain close family ties long distance.\n\nBut OP has basically said \u201cnah, don\u2019t care\u201d.

Did anything suspicious happen?", "NTA, this is very lovely and supportive. but after some time to cool off, you might want to open lines of communication to discover why they reacted so strongly and see how you can repair whatever they think is broken about the relationship. sometimes kids get something in their head about their parents and then just live with it without realizing it was sourced from childhood perspective and not reality.\n\nalso, use enby, not NB. NB already means non-black.", "INFO: I want to lean toward n t a but I have to wonder at the family dynamic.  You mention the oldest grandchild is 13 and you and your wife travel a lot to see them and you've always supported your son and intend to retire where your oldest lives.   You are n t a for your response but I highly suspect your two younger kids feel like you show favoritism towards their brother. You've already told them you're retiring to another country which is fine but how long have you been saying this? Have they heard it since they were teens? I get the feeling a teen hearing this might feel \"dad is far more interested in his grandkids than having any part in our adult lives.\" While your kids were minors did you take them on various small vacations or were most of the trips during their teen years spent seeing your grandkids.  \n\nIt's likely your kids are reacting our of some kind of jealousy or feeling like you care more for your oldest and your grandkids than you do for them.", "NTA", "NTA so you said you accept whatever makes them happy and they are upset with that?

I was unhappy with the plans of my father, too, when he isolated from me with my stepmom. He used to show preference to his older daughter with kids over me, and I am childfree. They would do things for my sister and her family, like give more expensive gifts and visit. I don't actually lash out on him like your family did, but it does get me in my feelings sometimes. Perhaps your younger children feel the same way I do- like you are OK retiring with your other parts of your family and leaving them behind.", "NTA.  \nThey were honest with you, and you were honest with them.  \nThey apparently weren't expecting unwavering support in their decision.  \n\"Dad, we don't want kids.\"  \n\"Okay  I don't want to feel pressured to do something just because you think I expect it\"\n\"HoW dArE yOu\"  \nThat's actually  pretty amusing.", "NTA\n\nYour reaction and justification sound logical and actually very supportive.\nThe problem is I think that them announcing that they would not be giving you grandchildren was also a test; perhaps they wanted you to want grandchildren from them, much like you would have wished grandchildren from oldest son had he not had any already.\n\nI think your youngest two may still have some deeply buried insecurities about how you feel about them. Good luck sorting that out...", "NTA.  Based on who your second litter of kids are, they thrive on discord and finding silly things to feel persecuted over.

At least you have one child you can be proud of.", "NTA \nThe fact that they came to you together to unform you that neither of them are planning on having kids is weird, they're siblings, not a couple.

Unless there's more to this story?", "NTA but have you considered the possibility they say they don't want kids to provoke a reaction from you? Apparently their mother being really upset made them feel really good, so attention seeking is the likely explanation there. \n\nAlso, the fact you have a relationship with your older child and his kids may have caused jealousy from your younger 2. \n\nIt's a lose-lose situation. React, they'll say you are disrespecting their choice. Don't react, you're an emotionless AH. \n\nIf you're planning to retire to your home country, the way they are thinking, they probably see it as you abandoning them \"because they do'nt want kids\". It's easy to feel like the victim at that age, but there isn't much you can do about them being both jealous and uninterested", "NTA. You can't win here.   \nIf you had kicked off about them not wanting kids, crying, begging pleading etc. then they would have been upset because you were trying to push them into something they didn't want to do and forcing your opinions on them.", "They weren't looking for acceptance...they were looking for attention and you didnt respond the way they wanted.", "Your kids with your wife have the best of every world. You respect their decision be childfree and they don't have to feel guilty fot not providing GCs because you already have them. What exactly is their problem? The world doesn't revolve around anyone's reproductive choices... This is such a non issue.", "I can maybe offer a little bit of perspective.\n\nAdults in their mid twenties, particularly women, are expected by the majority of society to both love and dote over children, and to want to have their own. If we don\u2019t, many people see us as being morally wrong and can even get angry. \n\nI\u2019ve interacted with complete strangers that get irrationally upset because I mention I don\u2019t have the desire to raise or even be around children. You get called selfish, blamed for the downfall of society even, etc.. People even write whole [articles](https://www.yourtango.com/family/childless-by-choice-women-big-part-society-deterioration?amp) bashing the choices of childfree women. \n\nThe point of saying all this is to note that being childfree is technically an alternative lifestyle, which garners a lot of hate from some people. It\u2019s becoming *much* more accepted recently, but it\u2019s still a risk to tell people\u2014 especially your parents, that you\u2019re childfree. They may reject you, they may chastise you. It\u2019s almost akin to coming out. \n\nIf I had to guess, they were expecting anger or disappointment on your end, but were still hoping for love and acceptance. This was obviously a big deal to them to tell you this, and you not having a significant reaction probably threw them off and definitely upset them a little bit. \n\nI wont say y t a because there\u2019s absolutely no way you could have known this. You\u2019re not a mind reader and you can\u2019t know what outcome or words of affirmation they wanted to hear from you. \n\nBut I also dont fault your daughters. Even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it, this was important to them. They wanted to hear \u201cI love and accept you\u201d, but heard \u201cThat\u2019s fine, I dont really mind.\u201d Their reaction is confusing and misdirected, but understandable. \n\nMy vote then is NAH.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t actually say you don\u2019t care because you already have a bunch of grandchildren, your attitude is more of a \u201cyou do you\u201d attitude where you just want your kids to do what makes them happy, and you\u2019re okay with them not having kids if they don\u2019t want to. That\u2019s exactly the type of supportive attitude I wish I got from my parents. It\u2019s honestly kind of bizarre that your kids are upset about it.", "NTA. What were they hoping to get from you there? What kind of trap was that on their parts?", "Wtf lmao", "NTA Sounds like they were looking for a reaction for attention. Attention seeking is annoying but usually children do it because they don\u2019t feel they are a priority but your kids are in the 20s I\u2019m not really sure what else you could of done.", "NTA. \n\nKids: Dad, we don\u2019t want to have children \nOP: that\u2019s fine, I support your decisions\nKids: Wow. So you didn\u2019t even want us to be born huh?\n\nIt\u2019s effed up that they WANTED you to be sad and that your acceptance made them angry. What kind of backwards ass logic is that??", "NTA.

Sounds like that was a lose-lose conversation, because if you would have given the different response, they most likely would have accused you of being unsupportive. .Also, they might not think the same way after some years and may reverse their decision to have children. It's not like that was any sort of binding declaration anyhow. Don't worry about it.", "OP Damned if you do damned if you don\u2019t.", "NTA.

I said I didn't want kids at that age too. (Guess what, I now have kids.) It strikes me as strange they announced this together, plus talked to you and your wife separately. Smells likes emotional blackmail.", "NTA nobody should assume everyone wants kids. Some people are infertile, some people are tokophobic, some people literally don't deserve kids.\n\nWe have passed 8 billion people on a planet with finite resources that we have brutalised since the start of the industrial revolution.\n\nIf you genuinely want kids because you want to raise a human, give them support and watch them flourish then great! Do that I love to see it.\n\nIf you're just doing it because \"I want something to love me\" \"I need someone to take care of me when I'm old\" \"They're an investment\" (a dumb investment)  \"I wanna dress it up in little feety pajamas\" \"It's just what you're supposed to do\" \"I'm trying to fix my relationship\" \"I'm bored\" \"I want *insert gender here*\" please don't. The kid doesn't deserve that, your basicallybirthing it with expectations it may never acheive and it breeds neglect and negativity which can affect that child their entire life. Get therapy and really think about it because you can't just shove it back in if you decide it's not for you. You can quit a job, sell a house/business you can't un-have a child.\n\nI'm not having children despite being great with them because I don't like being around children and it's not selfish, it's selfless. I may be putting my needs above someone that doesn't exsist, but they're not being affected by it because they don't exsist. I would argue that going against my self awareness and doing it because I've been told to is more selfish because I'm literally only thinking of appeasing people who won't help me and won't give a shit about me just to shut them up.

That has more to do with them than you.\n\nOne of my kids has an alternative lifestyle. That child chose to have kids. My kids who have stereotypical lifestyles do not. It's not that hard.

Especially when we live in a time where birth control and abortion are so controversial/hot topics. Lots of ways it can come up.", "I agree with you. I also wonder if these kids have heard/seen so many dramatic stories about conflict around 'coming out' style announcements that they were braced for that and then didn't know how to handle it when OP genuinely said he loves them not matter what. \n\nAny reasonable parent would believe and support a child who says they don't want to have children. I mean, why would you wish a lifelong commitment on someone who doesn't want it?", "To chime in with another experience, when I came out to my brother he responded with literally \u201cyeah okay, whatever.\u201d This was really hurtful to me at the moment and I remember how it felt like my heart dropped down to my shoes because it was something I\u2019d been so scared to do, really opening myself up and making myself vulnerable to him like that.

I'm glad you know what you want and live the way you want to!\") and turn it into something you didn't say at all. My guess is, that there is something else behind this that hasn't that much to do with you. You sound like a wonderful father and a person that lives with integrety and respects other peoples rights to make their own decision. \n\n- One idea would be, that they have been harbouring resentment/jealousy against your grandchildren for a long time (I don't know why, obviously) and this is just their way of expressing it. Maybe they don't even realize that that's what they are doing. \n\n- Another idea would be, that they *do* want to have children at some point, but are not honest about it to themselves (its *really* easy to lie to yourself/such realizations often take a lot of time. And/or they might think (/assume/fear) that there is no really safe/good way to have kids because of their gender identity and sexual orientation. The fear of homophobia etc. is obviously completely valid. Maybe they are sad about this without realizing it. And you not pushing back against their declaration just made it feel \"real\", that they won't try having kids. Maybe actually admitting that one of them would actually *want* kinds of their own would be too painful, because they feel its too difficult/not possible to have kids anway. And so telling themselves and you that they don't want it is easier to deal with. And anger is often a less difficult emotion than sadness.\n\nOf course this is all speculation. What I am trying to say is: Feelings around these topics are complicated. And it's really difficult to find out what one actually wants.\n\n- One other thing that might be behind this could be: It's more about feeling *actually* seen and valued by you than about anything else. Maybe with regards to their gender identity/sexual orientation? Its really wonderful you accept them! (I'm non-binary myself) But it could be the difference between you saying \"I don't care, I still love them.\" and \"It matters to me that they are NB and lesbian and I love them both in their truest identity, especially.\" I know that is a small diference, and maybe that is what you already do (*or: not what they would want anyways!!*). But that was an additional idea. \n\nSorry this is so long. I changed my mind a few times about wanting kids (I don't), and had to fight to find out, what I actually want. Plus I'm non-binary and queer, so ....yeah, there were a few things that might be possible in my eyes.\n\nThe bottom line is: Try talking to them. Tell them, that you *do* care again, and ask them what they want from you. And maybe try asking if there are other things/feelings they weren't open about over the years.\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nETA: fear of loosing you and your wife as parents, fear of loosing the connection you have as a family could be another thing behind this. There is a country they don't like and don't go to, there are grandchildren they don't know anymore and you and your wife have gone there many times, leaving them behind (no judgement on my part, just summarizing). *And* you are planning on retiring there! The thing all these factors have in common is: You prioritize this other place and those other people over them, even planning on living there permanently. Staying near the place your younger two kids live doesn't seem to be Important to you.

I would have imagined that you and your wife would be of similar mindsets and would have had similar responses to the kids broaching the subject. Also, I'm wondering why they talked to each of you separately, instead of one conversation with both you and your wife.

But no matter what they decide to do I\u2019ll be here to support them, because it has nothing to do with me and is completely up to them!\n\nThere are more than enough people out there without families looking for stand ins and we\u2019re happy to play those roles too.", "It's the world upside down \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 NTA and the situation is weird as hell", "NTA Sounds like they are bored in Ohio", "I have a feeling that it's not about what you said but about HOW you said it.\n\nINFO: is it possible you used a voice intonation/facial expression that gave of the vibe \"whatever, I don't care do whatever the fuck you want\" ?

You had the exact right response to their decision but why they\u2019d be upset makes zero sense unless they wanted you to be the bad guy.", "Wait? This makes no sense. NTA.

I'm childfree & was sterilized at 27 (yay, going on 43 now & no regrets). My mom was... ok with the surgery. I was so anxious about disappointing her & her reaction was a bit of a gut punch.

No one should have or not have kids based on parental approval: it\u2019s a personal decision. Dad\u2019s reaction was perfect: ideal even.

I suspect your younger kids are reacting out of a place where they feel you think being involved in their adult lives is not as important to you as your grandkids.

As a person who never had to question anything about myself (born and raised female, identify as female, heterosexual), I never had a second thought as to how I would react if a loved one came out to me. My personal opinion is that this is how they feel/are and my love for/opinion of them would not change one bit and my instinct would be to simply say, \"it doesn't matter\" to me \"what\" you are, I still love you just the way you are. I find it very distressing that I could be considered an asshole for such a response. I understand that coming out comes with a lot of stress, fear, anxiety, etc. and that it can be very traumatic for some people and that you probably all have a version of event in your head where you imagined all possible scenarios but for someone who doesn't deal with any of these emotions/fear, we cannot possibly be expected to react exactly the way you imagined it in your mind! If someone tells you it doesn't matter to them, depending on the tone they use, I would expect it to be clear that what is meant is that it doesn't change our opinion of who you are. Give people a chance to express themselves fully once they react. If they say \"it doesn't matter\" maybe pry a little and ask them to explain further. Is it that they don't give a shit about you or is it more likely that your coming out doesn't diminish their love for you? However, I will admit that if someone comes out to me one day, I will keep all these reactions in mind and express myself as thoroughly as possible. I'm not opposed to doing my own work to make these stories better for those coming out. But I hope you can add this scenario to all those built up in your mind before you tell someone so that you're prepared for the \"it doesn't matter\" response.", "Exactly. When I told my mom I was bi, she was so casual about it that it really threw me. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re holding a door closed with all your might but it suddenly opens the other way and you go flying. And parents being upset at no grandchildren bc queer is such a common thing in the queer community that the kids were almost certainly braced.

I understand hearing coming out stories about being NB or lesbian and being sensitive about your parent\u2019s reaction in a case like that - but both of his kids already did that, and dad already approves of them being who they are. Why even sit your parents down at 21 to \u201ccome out\u201d as child free in the first place, especially if your parents are already good with you being who you are? I get that mom was slightly upset because she won\u2019t have biological grandkids, but you need both of them to make a big deal of it? About a decision you made when your brain isn\u2019t even done forming yet?

It's a Big Feeling, even for those who aren't scared at all.\n\nWhen someone reacts like it *wasn't* a big deal for us to tell them, at best it feels dismissive.

Maybe I'm an outlier?", "I am Bi but I didn't expect my family to have some huge response like it was a defining moment in their lives. They knew just like your family probably did.

Im happy for you that it sounds like you knew your family would accept you, but many of us grappled with the quite realistic fear of being disowned by family members just for coming out. In that moment of indifferent-sounding \u201cyeah, whatever\u201d, I was gripped by a feeling of horror and distress that my own brother, who I called my best friend growing up, might not want anything more to do with me ever again. I think it\u2019s completely understandable to have these feelings."]}
