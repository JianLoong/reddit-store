As someone who doesn't want kids myself, their responses just seem ODD.", "Your kids sound like they want you to be upset about it. That\u2019s messed up- you love and support them and they get upset about it? How does that make you emotionless and unfeeling? Are they trying to manipulate you?\n\nHard NTA.", "NTA, it\u2019s not like you said \u201ckids come down here I want to tell you something. I don\u2019t care if you give me grandchildren because I already have six.\u201d You simply didn\u2019t pressure them to change their minds. Their reaction sounds as if their approaching you was a test of some sort. Good luck with them.", "NTA\n\nYour children decided they don't want to have kids, and are upset that... *you support them no matter what they decide*? They are upset that you are not angry? That's so fucked up.\n\nAs someone here said, it seems all your kids want is to pick a fight. You have no good option and no matter what you say, they will find a reason to say you don't care.\n\nThe main issue here is that, they believe you don't care about them. They think you care more about your remote family (the fact that you plan to retire in your home country when you're old, is a sign of abandonment for them). You need some family therapy.", "NTA\n\nThey asked you about being childfree and would you mind - you said you respect their decision and hope they have the lives that they want.\n\nThen your children got upset with the answer.  That bit is a little strange.\n\nIt is almost like they wanted another reaction from you.  Maybe it was a weird type of test however you gave a correct answer.  It is THEIR life and it is THEIR choice.  They are adults and you are letting them choose their own path.\n\nIs it possible they have some unresolved jealousy as their mother loves your grandchildren?", "NTA, your kids should be grateful they have a supportive father who respects their life choices. Even if you already having grandchildren has influenced your mindset on them giving you grand children, that's a win for them because it takes the pressure off them.", "NTA, it seems like they are looking for some kind of attention. Maybe they feel neglected in some way\u2026?", "NTA\n\nBeing upset because your dad supports your choices is really strange.", "NTA. Your kids just want to complain about something. They resent their half brother. They resent their nieces and nephews. They resent you take multiple trips a year to this other country. They resent that money is sent abroad for the family. They probably resent your retirement plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you had an emotional reaction to them not having kids then it would have been \u201cWhy don\u2019t you support who we are like you support brother?\u201d There\u2019s no way you could do well in that conversation in their eyes. But you did the right thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you are giving them attention and showing them love. If they haven\u2019t wanted to come on trips to your home country since they were 13, perhaps they feel abandoned every time you go? It doesn\u2019t make their attitude right, but a young teenager will develop strong emotions about a situation and that carries on through adult years. It\u2019s hard to overcome that teenage logic, despite now being old enough.", "This is completely bonkers. They\u2019re mad at you for supporting their choices??\n\nMy half sister\u2019s dad spent years pushing against her not wanting to have kids and it really stressed her and put a strain on her marriage. \n\nMy best guest as to their thoughts is that they had prepared themselves for a worst case scenario where you\u2019re devastated and ask them to change their minds. And when it didn\u2019t happen\u2026 they were surprised enough to feel indignant..?\n\nMy best guess. Regardless, you\u2019re NTA for sure.", "NTA. They said what they plan to do, you said \u201cOK,\u201d and now they want to be angry at your reaction. I think the plan was that you would complain about no grandkids so they could complain that you don\u2019t respect their choice. But since you DO respect their choice, they came up with another reason to be angry.  Let it go, they\u2019re looking for problems/attention.\n\nDo they live at home with you?", "huh? NTA looks to me like drama baiting. They wanted some emotional response but you gave them a understanding response telling them that they should do what will make them happy. Many kids wish they could be that lucky.   \n\n\nMaybe? Your tone was dismissive and uncaring? Short of them just trying to bait an emotional response that's the only reason I can think of. Like not what you said but how you said it?", "NTA.  Your kids wanted you to freak out like their mom did. You have six grandchildren. I don't know why but they want to hurt you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Even if you don\u2019t think you are in the wrong or said anything wrong\u2014they got the impression you did (either by how you said what you said or how you\u2019ve said other things). To resolve this and set better foundations for the rest of your guys\u2019 relationship I\u2019d consider sitting them down again and say you were reflecting on the conversation and wanted them to know you love and care about them. Then think about what in their futures you could express care/involvement in. For example maybe, saying i would love to meet your partners in the future and take you guys out to dinner. Or I\u2019d love to help you when you are looking to buy your first house. Think of the other \u201cmilestones\u201d that parents show care and involvement in besides have grandkids.", "This is difficult. They were honest with you and you were honest with them and they're mad because you accepted their choices. The first impression I get is that they are jealous or envious or just don't like the fact that you have another child from a 1st wife and you have stayed in contact with them.  You could try to have a zoom party where they all gather with you and zoom with your son and grandkids and do like an introductory kind of thing. Other than that I'm not sure what else you could do.", "NTA. Sorry that they're snowflakes", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t even know what to say. You said and did the right thing. You respected their choice and want what\u2019s best for them and don\u2019t want them to force themselves into a life that they don\u2019t want to please you. They are the assholes here, what did they want here besides your love and acceptance and respect?

Just because you didn't react in the way they wanted doesn't mean you are wrong.", "Idk something seems to be missing for this kind of reaction especially if you have a good relationship with them", "NTA. I do agree that there seems to be something missing here though - possibly resentment about the oldest sibling or time spent in your home country\u2026 but I am also wondering whether your home country would be as accepting of your NB & Lesbian children - could they be out & proud there? Has that possibly got something to do with some discomfort re: the other sibling & travel there? \n\nTheir statement to you definitely seems to be a test which you passed, however with a subtext that has been completely missed and possibly never addressed - hence the disproportionate reaction to the surface conversation. There\u2019s some digging to do!", "NTA \n\nWhere they secretly filming you and wanted a different reaction for Internet clout and some video about a cruel parent for a specific country narrative.", "NTA \n\nYour kids are looking for drama amd are pissed you aren't feeding it.", "I think they were looking for a response which would have turned into a fight, and then they were disappointed.

They need to move out on their own and live their lives, not sit at home picking fights with dad over nothing.", "But it seems to fit though\n\n\"Snowflake\" is a derogatory slang term for a person, implying that they have an inflated sense of uniqueness, an unwarranted sense of entitlement, or are overly-emotional, easily offended, and unable to deal with opposing opinions.", "It feels strongly like something is missing here...", "Your making that assumption based on what the op said alone?\n\nHow do you know they are not right, and he is cold and unemotional towards them? Both of them seem upset about the same thing, so is it hard to believe they may have a point", "Possibly. Their reaction feels over the top.
