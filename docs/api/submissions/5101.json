That\u2019s messed up- you love and support them and they get upset about it? How does that make you emotionless and unfeeling? Are they trying to manipulate you?\n\nHard NTA.", "NTA, it\u2019s not like you said \u201ckids come down here I want to tell you something.

That's so fucked up.\n\nAs someone here said, it seems all your kids want is to pick a fight. You have no good option and no matter what you say, they will find a reason to say you don't care.\n\nThe main issue here is that, they believe you don't care about them. They think you care more about your remote family (the fact that you plan to retire in your home country when you're old, is a sign of abandonment for them). You need some family therapy.", "NTA\n\nThey asked you about being childfree and would you mind - you said you respect their decision and hope they have the lives that they want.\n\nThen your children got upset with the answer.  That bit is a little strange.\n\nIt is almost like they wanted another reaction from you.  Maybe it was a weird type of test however you gave a correct answer.  It is THEIR life and it is THEIR choice.  They are adults and you are letting them choose their own path.\n\nIs it possible they have some unresolved jealousy as their mother loves your grandchildren?", "NTA, your kids should be grateful they have a supportive father who respects their life choices. Even if you already having grandchildren has influenced your mindset on them giving you grand children, that's a win for them because it takes the pressure off them.", "NTA, it seems like they are looking for some kind of attention. Maybe they feel neglected in some way\u2026?", "NTA\n\nBeing upset because your dad supports your choices is really strange.", "NTA. Your kids just want to complain about something.

But you did the right thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you are giving them attention and showing them love. If they haven\u2019t wanted to come on trips to your home country since they were 13, perhaps they feel abandoned every time you go?

They\u2019re mad at you for supporting their choices??\n\nMy half sister\u2019s dad spent years pushing against her not wanting to have kids and it really stressed her and put a strain on her marriage. \n\nMy best guest as to their thoughts is that they had prepared themselves for a worst case scenario where you\u2019re devastated and ask them to change their minds. And when it didn\u2019t happen\u2026 they were surprised enough to feel indignant..?\n\nMy best guess. Regardless, you\u2019re NTA for sure.", "NTA. They said what they plan to do, you said \u201cOK,\u201d and now they want to be angry at your reaction. I think the plan was that you would complain about no grandkids so they could complain that you don\u2019t respect their choice. But since you DO respect their choice, they came up with another reason to be angry.  Let it go, they\u2019re looking for problems/attention.\n\nDo they live at home with you?", "huh? NTA looks to me like drama baiting. They wanted some emotional response but you gave them a understanding response telling them that they should do what will make them happy. Many kids wish they could be that lucky.   \n\n\nMaybe? Your tone was dismissive and uncaring? Short of them just trying to bait an emotional response that's the only reason I can think of.

To resolve this and set better foundations for the rest of your guys\u2019 relationship I\u2019d consider sitting them down again and say you were reflecting on the conversation and wanted them to know you love and care about them.

Instead I got tears and guilt tripping and asked to justify myself. They acted like it was a *right* of theirs that I was stripping away from them, and they got more upset by the fact that I didn't feel \"empathy for their plight\" because I was unapologetic about it. Basically I felt like an incubator and not their daughter.\n\nThe only thing I can theorize about your kid's reaction is that they took your reaction as you saying \"I already have grandkids, yours wouldn't have mattered anyways so no loss there\" sort of thing, and that probably freaked them out. I mean I don't know if there's some underlying reason as to why they felt that way (like maybe they've always been compared to your oldest) or if it's all in their heads, but regardless, in this specific situation they are in the wrong.", "NTA.

They told you their intent to not have kids unprompted, and then they\u2019re upset that you\u2019re being respectful of their choices? Very odd. If I was in their position, I\u2019d be relieved to not have that pressure put on me, even if it was because my parent was getting that \u201cgrandkid fulfillment\u201d from another sibling. What were you supposed to do, argue with them and tell them that you expect them to have children? \n\nPerhaps it was an issue of the exact verbage or something, but it sounds like they\u2019re lookin for a fight.

Maybe they resent you wanting to retire closer to him than to them?\n\nThe only other thing I can think of is the nature of your reaction. My wife has Aspergers Syndrome and her emotional reactions are very muted compared to neurotypical people. It's very easy to mistake her lack of outward emotion for a lack of caring.

You did the right thing. \n\nMy theory is that your kids discussed beforehand what your reaction might be, and decided that the only reason you might not freak out would be because you had other grandchildren.

Clearly they assumed that a parent who really loved them would care about having grandchildren from them, and by saying you were ok with it, they read into it that you do not care about them. I think saying that you realize by not having grandchildren through them, there are certain special events and milestones you won\u2019t get to celebrate with them, and that you want to be sure to celebrate others. Ask them what milestones they will want to celebrate because you want to know what is important to them.", "Two independent individuals who made the same \u201cmonumental decision\u201d and collaborated to announce it at the same time smells like them looking for a fight.

There\u2019s probably a reason these kids wanted to have it out.\n\nI\u2019d say ESH", "Exactly.  You don't just announce unprompted that you aren't going to have children.  The story is missing the reason the kids felt the need to say it, so either side or both could be at fault for whatever led up to this.  But the kids are definitely TA for their reaction to being told OP would respect their wishes.", "I\u2019d bet anything it\u2019s this. They were opening up to OP and may have had to work up the courage to tell him something that in some way made them feel vulnerable. Not exactly looking for a fight, but maybe preparing for one with prepared responses. \n\nSo If his response was basically \u201cWhatever\u201d instead of \u201cHey, that\u2019s cool.

It took us 20 years of arguing because I didn\u2019t realize there was a second, unspoken part to the statement, and she thought it should have been obvious.\n\nIf it\u2019s like this, I\u2019d honestly say NAH, they\u2019re just talking past each other and need to sit down (maybe with a counselor?) and make sure all the words are said, not implied.", "To me it sounds like there\u2019s some underlying favouritism - OP and his wife spend a lot of time travelling to see eldest son and his grandkids, and they plan to retire there \n\nAnd I get that\u2019s tough, especially given how young the two others are. Your parents planning to leave you behind and uproot their lives is a big deal, not least because they both still live in the family home. \n\nThey could have been hoping that when their parents retire, they were planning to spend plenty of time coming back and visiting their assumed US grandkids, and actually put effort into the relationship with their younger kids - it\u2019s hard to maintain close family ties long distance.\n\nBut OP has basically said \u201cnah, don\u2019t care\u201d. Which is potentially where they thought that OP might not care about his relationship with them as much, and is planning on focusing on his elder son for the rest of his life. \n\nIt\u2019s a lot of conjecture, I admit - but I remember growing up with my parents talking about retiring to the other side of the world and it\u2019s confusing, to say the least", "That\u2019s how this sub works.
