It\u2019s a private area that has a separate exit out of the building, a couch, a rug, calm lighting, & resources for dealing with pet grief. Owners can hold their babies in this setting while they pass, say goodbye to the body, or process their loss. \n\nThere is a peephole in the door of this area that allows staff to see inside if the door is shut. This so that: 1- no one barges in on an owner in their time of grief. 2 - sometimes owners leave without telling us they\u2019ve gone, leaving a body alone In this area. The peephole allows us to check in & see if the owner has left without disturbing them. we only give a quick peek, & then move on so as not to violate anyone\u2019s privacy. \n\nA few nights ago, I rounded the corner & found a coworker standing pressed against the door, staring through the peephole. I slowed down, & noticed that he wasn\u2019t looking away. He was standing there, staring through it, & kind of\u2026 smirking. My stomach dropped & I immediately felt sick.
