It was a courthouse wedding followed by lunch with my new husband and then a weekend trip. No professional photographer, just a friend who met up with us to take 20 minutes of photos. \n\nI booked a session with a stylist Friday morning to get my hair & makeup done since I\u2019m not very good at doing it myself. I booked a basic glam package, about 1/2 the cost of the bridal package because I didn\u2019t feel I needed airbrushing or makeup that lasted all day.\n\nAfter she was finished, she took my picture for her instagram page and tagged me in it. Over the weekend, I uploaded a few photos of my husband and I after our ceremony and enjoying our honeymoon.  \n\nThe stylist saw the post in my wedding dress and left a long, ranting comment about clients that take advantage of stylists and lie to get cheaper services. She finished by calling me scummy and cheap. I also received an email from her with an invoice for the \u201cremainder of my balance due\u201d.\n\nI blocked the stylist and called the salon yesterday and the owner took the same stance saying that I lied and cheated them out of what they were owed for their services. She told me I better pay the invoice before I ended up hanging up on her.\n\nDid I do something wrong? I don\u2019t feel like I received a service that matches the price they\u2019re asking and I don\u2019t plan to pay it.", "created_utc": 1694537791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16gwlkh/aita_for_not_being_honest_with_the_hair_makeup/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because you put on a white (presumably) dress and got married in it doesn\u2019t mean it required a bridal package price. \n\nIf you had insisted on airbrushing and the other \u201cfancier\u201d options without paying for them, sure. But it\u2019s not me MUAs decision where you can and can\u2019t wear the makeup after application.", "NTA.  I\u2019d consider unblocking them to get more info.  Ask them to explain the difference in service between the glam and the bridal.  They\u2019ll say airbrushing, longer lasting blah blah.  Ask them if you received those things? No? So why exactly are you paying?  They must be saying that the services are identical and the only difference is a higher price for the wedding industry.  And you\u2019d love to share that info with everyone with reviews, etc.", "NTA. You got and paid for a service and thereafter it\u2019s up to you what you do. This almost sounds like the salon would charge more just because it\u2019s connected to a wedding. Some classic wedding industry stuff here - \u201clet\u2019s double the price because it\u2019s a wedding and everyone just has to pay that premium\u201d.", "NTA You paid for the basic package for hair and make up not the bridal package. Unless they are ripping off their clients and charging more for the exact same service by using the word wedding, you paid for the service you received.", "NTA You paid for the service you received. Simple as that. I'm curious what the difference is between the two packages to be worth double. If it's higher quality makeup, or a greater service component like extra touch-ups throughout the day, well you didn't receive that.", "NTA. You booked the service you wanted to receive. You received the package that you booked. It doesn't matter what the occasion was, that's none of their damn business! This is absurd, I would never do business with them again and leave a scathing Google review. If you were happy about the service you received at the time, I would mention that in the review but include how you were treated after!", "Hair and make up costs are higher for weddings because brides have higher standards for that day, and request perfect make up that lasts all day. Which requires more time, more expertise and more expensive tools from the artist. The bride is not paying extra *just* because it's her wedding day. She's paying extra for the extra pressure put on the artist. \n\nIf the stylist does not understand that, I fear her bridal package. It must be pretty basic but she jacks up the price because it's for that one special day. \n\nYou're not in the wrong and I'm sure that if they were to take legal actions, no lawyer would take in their case, unless it's written somewhere on their website or other that no matter what is the service provided, if a woman gets her hair and make up done for her wedding, she has to pay extra. \n\nNTA. Fuck them. (and fuck the wedding industry as a whole too)", "NTA You wanted the glam package so you paid for the glam package. Like you said, you didn\u2019t need the level of makeup that was going to last all day. Hopefully they don\u2019t try and take you to small claims court over this. You\u2019d probably win, but it would just be a hassle.", "NTA. You paid for a package and they provided the services included in the package. They can't charge you for services not rendered. If airbrushing etc. was part of the bridal package and they didn't do this, they can't charge you bridal price and shouldn't be mad. You didn't scam them out of anything at all.", "NTA\n\nYou paid for the thing you got done.\n\nIf you got the bridal package and they would've done the exact same thing, they are the liars.\n\nWhat you are wearing or doing on the day after you where styled shouldn't matter to them.\n\nI'm really sorry this is happening to you. And I would leave a review everywhere you can. Not just for this, but also for the salon saying 'you'd better pay the invoice', that's sounds like a threat, if you don't do this then we'll do....'.", "NTA - why do they offer the simpler package if they're going to harass people for the difference in price? You wanted a more basic package, booked it, they provided that more basic service, and you all left happy. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA. Unless you signed something that states you promise you won't get married after these services, they are just shit out of luck. If they keep pestering you, report them to the BBB.", "NTA  if they want you to pay more just because you used it to get married, then the bridal package they are selling for twice the price is a scam!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou got what you paid for. you paid exactly for what she povided.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you do after is NONE of her business.", "NTA services requested, rendered, & paid for in full. What you did after the fact is not their business", "NTA - the agreed upon service was rendered and paid for. So, are they admitting, on social media, that they charge extra for the same service because you tell them it\u2019s a wedding?  Sounds like the stylist is shady.  I would reply, I didn\u2019t ask for a wedding service, you did not charge me for a wedding service. Are you saying the services are identical and you are just charging more, with no additional benefit to the customer?", "NTA. You asked for a particular service and paid for it, not for a different service.", "NTA. You didn't want the bridal package. You just wanted a glam session. Presumably, there is a difference in the two services. If its the same service and they just slap an extra zero on there because \"wedding\" then it's a scam. I'd be interested to find out what their bridal package offers. Often it will consist of touch ups and special products specifically for photos that will require more effort from the MA. Doesn't sound like they did any of that for you. Congratulations!", "NTA.\nSince I don't think that there is an obligation to exclusively book the \"bridal package\" in case of a wedding the stylist has no right to rant about your choice. You bought and paid for how YOU wanted to look at your wedding, that has nothing to do with \"lying to the stylist\".", "NTA you didn\u2019t request the bridal package and you didn\u2019t get their bridal package, why would you pay for it? Why you need makeup isn\u2019t their business unless you make it their business.", "NTA\n\nYou paid for what you booked. Anything else outside her salon is none of her damn business\n\nI would be blowing up socal media calling out her predatory scam", "NTA. They're upset because the wedding industry is like movie theater refreshments. You pay 5 times as much for basically the same goods or services, just because it's a wedding.\n\nIf you took your SO to a very ritzy restaurant and ordered and ate your meal. Then you pay your bill, about $150, and leave.\n\nYou go to the beach, and in the moonlight, with soft surf sound,  you get down on one knee and proposed.  You post pics.\n\nThen the waiter sees the post and explodes on you because you should have ordered their Proposal Special, which includes their most expensive entre, a $500 bottle of champagne, two orders of tiramasu, and elephant dung coffee. He demands you pay for the proposal package because you got engaged without telling them.\n\nOh, and if you bought gas on the way to your wedding, then you owe the wedding gas tax.  \n\nThis is a time when posting a negative review might be warranted specifically because the owner doubled down.", "NTA. \u201cBridal\u201d stuff costs more because you get better stuff - better products, a touch-up kit, a person on call, prompt delivery, etc. You didn\u2019t get any of that, and didn\u2019t ask for it, so you shouldn\u2019t have to pay for it.", "NTA. You are right. As the owner reacted as they did I would go online (google/yahoo/yelp etc.) and post a review, stating what they did. If they keep calling you document each time they call with date and time and tell them you will sue them if they keep it up and you will ask a judge to decide if you own them money.", "Nta I would assume that a bridal package would be a completely different service which you didn\u2019t pay fpr", "NTA. When I got married, I didn't want to pay for the bridal package. I told my stylist that she had free range to do anything she wanted as long as my hair was off my face.", "Almost called Y T A cause it read kinda weird to me, like you had failed to pay half of the price you originally agreed to. However upon reading again a few times, it sounds like both parties agreed to a set of services for a fixed price, services were rendered, the price was paid, but then once the makeup artists discovered it was for a wedding, they suddenly decided that their services should have received more money? If that's the case, very much NTA. Block them all and let them try to take it to court.

My bridal package involved an initial consultation to discuss her style and what I wanted, to ensure it was a good match, plus the makeup artist buying additional shades that suited my skin tone better, *and* doing two separate trials, for example. It involved her coming to my location, doing multiple touchups to get it just right, etc. So bridal prices aren't automatically a scam - my artist worked hard to give me the absolute best experience possible, and was paid accordingly. But a quick glam look with zero of that additional labour and stress that comes with the \"big day expectations\" does not automatically justify bridal prices.\n\nEdit to add: She also gave me a touch up kit to bring with me with extra lipstick, concealer, q-tips, etc!", "NTA but find out the difference between the two packages or if it's just an upcharge because they can.", "This!
