One of his bullies was a kid named Ryan, and he had a twin name, Rebecca. Ryan was a pain in the ass for basically everyone in the school. When high school came around most people chose the private high school or the public one and people split up. Ryan went to the public school while my son went to the private one.\n\nMy older son went to the public one also, I let them choose which one. He is a junior while my youngest is a sophomore. Ever since Alex went to high school he really came out of his shell and the bullying completely stopped. The new school really helped. My oldest started to date Rebecca and she is a nice girl.\n\nThe problem is Alex refuses to go anywhere is Rebecca will be there. It came to a head today when we were going to the picnic and Rebecca was invited. The moment Alex heard he refused to get in the car. I finally had enough and told him basically suck it up and deal with seeing Rebecca. That she is not Ryan and that he has confirmed that she never did anything. We argued and I left him at home for the picnic. My wife thinks I am being too harsh, but I think it is ridiculous for him to refuse to be near someone that didn't do anything wrong and is only related to Ryan\n\nEd; We have talked to him about it, multiple conversation with me and my wife. He was in therapy and stopped of his own free will. At this point all he is doing is damaging his relationship with his brother. Can't bring Rebecca to the house, can't be around her at all when she has done nothing wrong. Even a picnic which had a ton of people at. The oldest kids birthday is coming up at this point if he invites his gf well then is brother won't be there. It is ridiculous\n\nEd2: Looking at all the responses, Alex is going back to therapy if he wants to or not, so that will be a conversation I know will not go well. I will let him pick to go back to his old one or find a new one.

I just commented on another post with a bad parent.\n\nTelling someone to \"Suck it up\" is NEVER the answer to anything. It is the height of lazy parent crap. \n\nIn the moment when your kid was upset why not forget the picnic and go sit down and TALK to your kid. Not at your kid. Listen to him. What is he feeling that makes him uncomfortable around Rebecca? Then LISTEN.\n\nYou may feel that you want to teach your kid to not let this kind of thing rule his life but instead of bad advice like \"Suck it up\" you could explain that allowing negative emotions to rule his decisions only feeds them and will make him feel worse in the long run. It is much better to attempt to deal with the situation in a healthy manner. Explain that you would really like him to go and that you will be there for support the entire time. If it is too tough then you can leave early.

Further emotional and mental abuse can far outlast physical abuse.", "A very soft YTA - I understand your train of thought but there has to be more to your son\u2019s story for this to make sense to them; is it because of appearances and just the similarities that are triggering? Is it because although Ryan did the bullying, maybe Rebecca stood on the sides and watched their twin instead of stepping in? Is it because your son is going through a list of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and is \u201cprotesting\u201d the relationship to avoid having any future interactions with Ryan? Is it more than one of these or none at all? You need to have a calm, open, and honest conversation with your son and allow them to provide more context without fear of judgment - so avoid telling them to suck it up or that their feelings don\u2019t make sense.", "NTA.

I think it is safe to assume that she knew what her brother was doing and chose not to do anything so she contributed to it a little bit. This should be taken a little more seriously and you seem to be brushing it off. You should try to respect your son's wishes, if you force him to be around her, he will only resent you.", "INFO you say in one of the comments speaking of Ryan \"she said\", so ryan and rebecca are twin sisters, identical perhaps.\n So your son should face the identical replica of his tormentor? If this is the case, you have knowingly hidden an extremely important fact allowing to better understand your son's behavior.", "Light YTA: I agree with you. This situation cannot go on, and it is a little over the top for your son to refuse to interact with Rebecca when Rebecca did nothing wrong (atleast as far as we know). However, I don\u2019t think telling him to suck it up when he clearly still has some residual PTSD from the bullying is the correct way to go about this. \n \n\nI think you and your wife need to have a frank conversation with him about what the issue is with Rebecca. Is it that Rebecca looks like Ryan? Is it that she didn\u2019t do anything to stop Ryan and Alex feels she could have? Is Alex worried about her (intentionally or inadvertently) giving Ryan information about him that he could use to attack him? Did she do something to Alex that just never previously came up? \n\nYou won\u2019t know the answer to that question until you have that conversation with him. Once you have that knowledge, you and your wife, with Alex\u2019s input can figure out what to do next. It also might not be a bad idea to have a separate conversation with your wife, your oldest, and Rebecca about what\u2019s going on. If it\u2019s that he felt she failed to prevent Ryan from bullying the \u201cnerds\u201d maybe a simple, but sincere apology will go a long ways?

Exposure therapy is helpful in the right circumstances. Make sure to hang out in places where he can get away easily/have a break from his trigger.

Nobody cared, and it was still supposed to be my own fault if I didn't ace the class, since I was supposed to somehow \"ignore\" being kicked constantly.\n\nYes, it was maddening that nobody cared, but that's not what's happening with this kid.
