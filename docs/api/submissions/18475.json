One of his bullies was a kid named Ryan, and he had a twin name, Rebecca. Ryan was a pain in the ass for basically everyone in the school. When high school came around most people chose the private high school or the public one and people split up. Ryan went to the public school while my son went to the private one.\n\nMy older son went to the public one also, I let them choose which one. He is a junior while my youngest is a sophomore. Ever since Alex went to high school he really came out of his shell and the bullying completely stopped. The new school really helped. My oldest started to date Rebecca and she is a nice girl.\n\nThe problem is Alex refuses to go anywhere is Rebecca will be there. It came to a head today when we were going to the picnic and Rebecca was invited. The moment Alex heard he refused to get in the car. I finally had enough and told him basically suck it up and deal with seeing Rebecca. That she is not Ryan and that he has confirmed that she never did anything. We argued and I left him at home for the picnic. My wife thinks I am being too harsh, but I think it is ridiculous for him to refuse to be near someone that didn't do anything wrong and is only related to Ryan\n\nEd; We have talked to him about it, multiple conversation with me and my wife. He was in therapy and stopped of his own free will. At this point all he is doing is damaging his relationship with his brother. Can't bring Rebecca to the house, can't be around her at all when she has done nothing wrong. Even a picnic which had a ton of people at. The oldest kids birthday is coming up at this point if he invites his gf well then is brother won't be there.

It is the height of lazy parent crap. \n\nIn the moment when your kid was upset why not forget the picnic and go sit down and TALK to your kid. Not at your kid. Listen to him. What is he feeling that makes him uncomfortable around Rebecca? Then LISTEN.\n\nYou may feel that you want to teach your kid to not let this kind of thing rule his life but instead of bad advice like \"Suck it up\" you could explain that allowing negative emotions to rule his decisions only feeds them and will make him feel worse in the long run. It is much better to attempt to deal with the situation in a healthy manner. Explain that you would really like him to go and that you will be there for support the entire time. If it is too tough then you can leave early.

Further emotional and mental abuse can far outlast physical abuse.", "A very soft YTA - I understand your train of thought but there has to be more to your son\u2019s story for this to make sense to them; is it because of appearances and just the similarities that are triggering? Is it because although Ryan did the bullying, maybe Rebecca stood on the sides and watched their twin instead of stepping in? Is it because your son is going through a list of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and is \u201cprotesting\u201d the relationship to avoid having any future interactions with Ryan? Is it more than one of these or none at all? You need to have a calm, open, and honest conversation with your son and allow them to provide more context without fear of judgment - so avoid telling them to suck it up or that their feelings don\u2019t make sense.", "NTA.

You should try to respect your son's wishes, if you force him to be around her, he will only resent you.", "INFO you say in one of the comments speaking of Ryan \"she said\", so ryan and rebecca are twin sisters, identical perhaps.\n So your son should face the identical replica of his tormentor? If this is the case, you have knowingly hidden an extremely important fact allowing to better understand your son's behavior.", "Light YTA: I agree with you. This situation cannot go on, and it is a little over the top for your son to refuse to interact with Rebecca when Rebecca did nothing wrong (atleast as far as we know). However, I don\u2019t think telling him to suck it up when he clearly still has some residual PTSD from the bullying is the correct way to go about this. \n \n\nI think you and your wife need to have a frank conversation with him about what the issue is with Rebecca. Is it that Rebecca looks like Ryan? Is it that she didn\u2019t do anything to stop Ryan and Alex feels she could have? Is Alex worried about her (intentionally or inadvertently) giving Ryan information about him that he could use to attack him? Did she do something to Alex that just never previously came up? \n\nYou won\u2019t know the answer to that question until you have that conversation with him. Once you have that knowledge, you and your wife, with Alex\u2019s input can figure out what to do next.

If it\u2019s that he felt she failed to prevent Ryan from bullying the \u201cnerds\u201d maybe a simple, but sincere apology will go a long ways?

Exposure therapy is helpful in the right circumstances. Make sure to hang out in places where he can get away easily/have a break from his trigger.

Like maybe parents should be questioning brother on why choice of girlfriend. Like where is this going to go? Going marry into family that sent brother into serious therapy? Brother suppose to keep \u201csucking it up\u201d I guess. Wonderful supportive family\u2026", "Fraternal twins don\u2019t always even look alike no where in the post does it say they do", "From the post:\n\n>he has confirmed that she never did anything.", "Its a saying \" he said she said\"  It came from a song a while ago and is used often to describe when you have two people saying two different things", "Agree that therapy is the way. Alex, though, has to want to go for therapy to be effective.  Alex cut himself off from therapy when he actually needs it to sort through his unresolved trauma.", "This is why I said that they should have an actual conversation with their son instead of just telling him to get over it. I replied to this post before it was edited to say that he was in therapy, so I did not have any of that context.", "Except his son shouldn\u2019t be forced to be around someone he\u2019s uncomfortable with.", "No reason to assume that simply because she is Ryans twin.", "Sometimes words can hurt more than physical harm.

What use are you?\" \"Dumbass.\" \"Idiot.\" \"No one likes you.\" \"Bet I could get away with b***ing you up.\" And so many more...\n\nI also vividly remember waking up in a hospital from a failed overdose.

YTA.", "Well, sounds like he still needs it. Saying \"suck it up\" to someone who has been bullied isn't great. Does Rebecca resemble Ryan in anyway?", "Ah, then you need to get him back in, because he's obviously still suffering from PTSD. And YTA for trying to force him when he had such a visceral reaction.", "And that might have been fine if brother\u2019s girlfriend didn\u2019t bring it all back", "So what is he going to do if he has a boss in the future that looks or acts like his bully? Shut down and refuse to go to work? The mom is right", "It\u2019s hateful to refuse to be in the room with someone who did you no wrong.  Also\u2026trauma is getting thrown around way too freely.  He was verbally picked on.

I carry a great deal of it.\n\nOne piece is that I was viciously verbally abused by an aunt. Throughout my adult life, when I've seen a woman with short blond hair, I've immediately had a negative visceral reaction.\n\nWhen I realized this, instead of trying to ban short-haired blondes from the world, I began compensating for it. These other women have never harmed me, and it's not right to treat them as vicious because they somewhat resemble someone who is.\n\nNTA, OP. Your son shouldn't be allowed to shun his bully's sister for actions she did not perform.", "Are you 10 years old?", "He was throwing a temper tantrum. Bullying sucks but being bullied a few years ago doesn't excuse his behavior now.\n\nThis girl has done nothing to him.", "Honestly I feel bad for Rebekah. She's being treated badly and avoided because her brother is a little jerk.", "Sure, I get OP is upset. But the solution here is not to tell his kid to suck it up. He needs to talk with him, try to understand what is happening, and try to fix the situation. They both need to sit with Rebecca so they can have a talk and fix their relationship. \n\nTelling a kid that is struggling to \"suck it up\" is just toxic masculinity. The son is allowed to have feelings and he has the right to not want to be in a situation where he feel unsafe.", "But did you think that maybe the son realizes that if he has to interact with the twin, there's a good chance he will have to interact with his billy as well? Why bother?", "Yeah.   Not buying it.", "OK thanks, i am not native speaker and in my langage there the same meaning whithout the different pronouns, he said he said if the 2 are boys and he said, she said if there a boy and a girl", "This. He is old enough to make decisions for himself, even if they aren\u2019t the best decisions for him.

I'm very sorry you had to go through that and I genuinely hope you are doing better now.", "Yeah, the YTAs in this thread are wild to me. Reddit can be irrational about bullying, though (and I feel like I have to preface this by saying bullying is terrible and traumatic, but even then reddit seems to think any sort of reaction is a justification after being bullied). \n\nOP handled it badly by saying 'suck it up,' but the kid has had years of therapy for verbal bullying. The kid also says Rebecca did nothing to him. \n\nThis is not some type of Game of Thrones situation where the sins of the family carry on to everyone. Rebecca is his older brother's girlfriend, and it's insane that the older brother can't even bring Rebecca over to the house. \n\nOnly thing the younger, formerly bullied son is doing is wrecking his relationship with his older brother.", "Then he could get another job? Transfer to another department?", "No. He should get therapy or help to work through the trauma so that does not happen. What do you think telling him to suck it up is gonna do?", "Obviously something more was going on than him being \"verbally picked on\" if he can't even be in the same room as her.", "Having your parent telling you to \"suck it up\" is not \"developping coping skill\". It's \"being taught toxic masculinity\".\n\nIf OP wants his son to develop coping skill, he needs to sit down with him and talk, and then figure out what is coping skills could be in this situation.", "Sorry unless OP describes a  literal screaming meltdown, or screaming match not a temper tantrum. Sounds like he just refused to go. He didn't prevent anyone else from going. It honestly sounds like he still needs therapy. I was wondering if she resembled the bully. That might be enough to trigger him. There is no time limit on trauma. As I said it sounds like he still needs therapy.", "I can't really blame the son though. Yeah Rebekah had nothing to do with it, but she is still related to the billy, maybe the son isn't jazzed about the idea of having to become family with his billy?", "Yeah, I agree that OP needs to sit down with his son. He definitely handled this poorly. \n\nHe has the right to not be in a situation where he feels unsafe, but the problem is his feeling unsafe is irrational and impacting his relationship with his brother (and unfairly dragging Rebecca). T*he kid absolutely needs more therapy ASAP imo, or to see a different therapist because their current one is clearly not helping that much.* \n\nI disagree with Rebecca. Rebecca is a high school junior...a 16/17 year old girl should not have to sit down and deal with OP's youngest sons trauma when she had nothing to do with said trauma except to be related to the bully. It's putting way, way too much on a teenage girl to ask her to have a sit down with the kid.", "Op says they have talked about it multiple times and he was in therapy until he decided to quit. He is absolutely allowed to have feelings but he is not allowed to treat someone else like cr*p.", "I\u2019m a native speaker and the situation should be described as you stated.  I\u2019ve never heard he said she said used universally for all sex combinations of the people involved.", "Are you okay? I literally never said any of that.", "Yep. Got a spouse I love and a professional rumble machine who sits on my bladder and screams at me. Things are okay.\n\n\nBut people like to downplay bullying to \"it's just words!\" Seeing parents be so... Cold to their kid because \"well they didn't HIT you.\" Makes my blood boil tbh.", "There are moments in life where no matter how much therapy you get, you gotta \"suck it up\" and face reality. Hell if he spent a day with her he'd probably discover she isn't anything like her twin. By avoiding it and letting fear take over he is making it far worse for himself.", "Lol ya so spend his entire life in avoidance? That sounds so much healthier /s", "The kid is in therapy!", "That\u2019s how he describes it.  Not my description, his.", "Oh please.  Sometimes we actually do just have to deal with it.  Not everything needs a 14 step plan.", "If Alex was still actively in therapy? I\u2019d be  much more sympathetic to him. \n\nHowever: \n\n1) he\u2019s actively choosing to not deal with his traumas in therapy\n\n2) Rebecca did nothing wrong and can\u2019t help who her twin is\n\n3) Alex is choosing a path that hurts not only Rebecca but his brother.", "The kid was in therapy for *years* over this. OP has had multiple conversations about this. At some point he really does just need to suck it up. \n\nWhat if he gets a job and his direct manager is a guy named Ryan? Is he just gonna quit?", "He was in therapy and chose to leave on his own. If you\u2019re going to learn coping skills anywhere, that\u2019s where it would be. OP can only do so much if his son doesn\u2019t want to help himself.", "Exactly, life isnt ideal all the time sadly and he will be fine. I was bullied and put in my bullies friends class later (who did a little but not as much). I didnt like it but at the end of the day it was fine", "This. I have been through so much in my life and while therapy helps me talk through it, it is not magically fixing anything I\u2019ve dealt with and takes a good bit of effort on my part.", "He was. He is not anymore.", ">Sometimes we actually do just have to deal with it\n\nSure... but they are different way to \"deal with it\" ?! Maybe there is a easier way for the teenage boy to deal with it. Maybe they could organize a quick chat between the son and Rebecca to talk. Maybe he could go back to therapy. Maybe he could talk with his brother so he can learn that Rebecca is a nice person.\n\n\"Suck it up\" is the last resort, not the first one. This is just lazy parenting.", "Alex is a just kid and he is not expected to be able to regulate his emotion like an adult would do. It's the parent job to help them navigate those things and show then proper coping mechanism and help them understand their emotions.", "And the parents would possibly be harming the kid (and their relationship) if they forced him to continue, especially at high school age. This is a no-win situation for them.", "Pretty sure they\u2019ve talked about how Rebecca is a nice person.", "Yes but the parent cannot force their kid to go to therapy/talk through their issues if the kid refuses to.", "Well, they can still go to the other 38473847 ways they could solve the issue \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af", "Or maybe this kid is just wrong and being obstinate for the sake of it.", "Maybe. But how is OP supposed to know that if he doesn't talk with his kid and just right to \"suck it up\" without a proper conversation ?"]}
