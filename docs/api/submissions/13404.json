He was furious with me because I only buy groceries that I can also consume (eg. I buy milk for myself and my gran. I don't buy salami, since I can't eat it.)

You are an adult and what, how much, and how frequently you choose to eat are frankly none of their concern since they aren't paying for it.  I know that it sucks to keep tally of everything but if that's how they want to do it, then do that so they can see the hard numbers and know that you can't afford to feed them and that you are not wasting your money or using their groceries.  Short of getting your own refrigerator and keeping your food in your room that's likely only way to shut them up about using their food. \nAlso, you not only are an adult when it comes to your choice of meals but also The means by which you support yourself.

I couldn't move out if I had the chance, since I don't have enough savings, and not having a secure job means I couldn't pay rent. I don't have any friends I could realistically couch surf at til I find a job, either. Maybe my girlfriend, but we'll see.\n\nI'm also really concerned with my grandmother. I love her dearly, and she's always sided with me on these issues. She encourages me to eat, secretly gives me money for some side expenses, prioritises my health over college and  other things. I don't want to leave her with my parents. She trusts me way more than them, and gets anxious around them. My parents infantilise and neglect her just because she's elderly, needs help moving, and hard of hearing. I don't want her to be alone with that environment, and I couldn't take her with me either.", "I've considered it to be toxic, although this kind of behaviour is kind of normalised in my culture, or taboo to defy. I've just been looking for more \"appropriate\" jobs to save up more, but it's exhausting.", "I care about my grandmother a lot, and I don't want to leave her with my parents. She needs help with basic tasks, and she's fragile. I don't want her to be alone in a household where she's treated like a child. I might not have a choice, it seems, but that's really upsetting to think about.\n\nBut I think I'll reach out to my girlfriend about staying with her, so I can start saving money and be stable on my own.", "Girl, call social services and Adult Protective Services as soon as you can. Report what your parents are doing and how they are treating her, because neglect and infantilization count as elder abuse. I would report them for your treatment, too, because it sounds very much like they are abusing a disabled person by restricting your food and actively preventing you from working. \n\nLike, seriously. Call authorities now.", "The next time you get a job offer - take it. Don't allow your parents to have any input.", "From how you described the living situation it sounds as though your parents are using your grandmother against you. They don\u2019t want to deal with helping her so they\u2019re making it impossible for you to save any money to get out on your own so you\u2019re forced to stay to take care of her.", "This.  Right here.  Get some help.  For yourself AND your granny.", "OP, you are being abused. why are you not allowed to work at jobs that would accommodate you? all of this is very worrisome. NTA. get out as soon as you can", "Check and see what a home health aide for your grand would cost. And then show your parents that. Tell them they can either start paying you a fair wage for your services or you will be leaving. Possibly there will be some sort of assistance you can get if you're not living with them. Either way, the emotional toll they are taking on you is not worth it. You deserve better", "To be fair, I'm an adult. I think, legally, they don't have to do that after I'm 18. But my country has a very family-oriented culture, and it's very normal for generations to live together to take care of the elderly.\n\nI've spoken to my girlfriend a little while ago about this (super vaguely), and I might just... Open up, and ask if I can stay with her for a while. I feel like it's a really sudden move to make, with a push from Reddit nonetheless, but I'm tired of living like this.", "Unfortunately not. Disability allowance is really hard to get at all, and it's usually only granted to those with visible disabilities. I appear fine from the outside, I'm young, and haven't needed any surgeries for my joints, or special education for my autism, so neither are \"severe enough\" for me to get paid.\n\nI can, however, apply for a student allowance from the government. But it needs me to fill out my parents' information to ensure we're financially doing badly enough.", "Would your grandmother qualify for assistance?", "We don't have an equivalent of social services or adult protective services to step in. I could call the police, but since there's no proof of anything besides the conversations they have, I doubt it would get anywhere at all. Cases like these aren't taken very seriously where I live.\n\nNot only that, but children are seen like extensions of their parents, or like property- not in a real sense, but as in \"your parents can raise and discipline you however they want, at any age.\"\n\nI think my best opportunity would be moving out and hoping I can just take my grandmother with me after I get on my feet, based on how everyone says I need to leave ASAP.", "I never actually considered they might be using her, intentionally or not. That's really sad to consider, because I really want the best for her, and I'd keep caring for her completely by myself if I could. But they do occasionally use her hospital visits or eating schedule to make me cancel plans with friends, or job interviews, so maybe, and I really hope it isn't, but maybe, it's intentional?", "The problem is, if I get home later than 12 AM, it'll cause a lot of issues with my parents freaking out. I'm generally really sheltered, to the point where my mother occasionally checks my body for tattoos or piercings or marks to make sure I'm not doing anything \"weird\" outside. To be frank, I'm scared of what might happen, just because confrontation is really stressful to me.\n\nI'll take the first job offer I get, if I can crash at my girlfriend's place for a while. I don't think I could handle the amount of chaos to ensue, if I took things slowly. I think, if I want to leave, it has to be sudden so they can't stop me?", "I\u2019m so sorry, but it\u2019s intentional. Your parents are weaponizing your love for your grandmother against you.", "Intentional or not the result is the same.\n\nYour life has been placed on hold by your parents. You have every right to go meet new people, eat the foods you want to (although I do highly recommend testing new foods and preparation methods at your own pace), find a job, experience the misery that is rent, find a roommate to share that misery and enjoy all your new found freedoms with.\n\nIt\u2019s not selfish to want to live your life. Help as you can but try not to feel obligated when you can\u2019t.", "I know, it's probably unpolite to ask \nBut  im really curious,  in which culture, all this is completely ok. Your parents Keep you on the short leash, so they can control you. Like forbidding jobs. That's not normal.  Or going out after 12. They manipulate you so much,  that you start thinking,  you can't do anything without them. Collect in secret all your important documents like birth certificate,  passport,  insurance etc. And then, just leave and never look back.", "Leaving suddenly is a good idea, and it may also be a good idea if you move out when they\u2019re not home. Does your country have a domestic violence hotline that people can use when they need to make an escape plan? You\u2019re in an abusive situation, and if there\u2019s an organization that helps people do this, you should reach out to them for help.", "Not necessarily ok, but normalised. I live in southeastern Turkey, and generally don't feel safe going out past 12 regardless. I guess it does seem less extreme when you've lived like this your whole life."]}
