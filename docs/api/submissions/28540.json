Last night I went to a campout with my 4 year old at a group site with her daycare.   The nearest bathrooms and water were a good hike away, so we didn\u2019t go until sunrise the next morning.   There wasn\u2019t much of a path, but what was there ended right between two RVs and you could see the bathrooms, so we just walked quietly through.  On the way back, a women in her early 60s quickly shuffled over and told me that it was extremely disrespectful and against etiquette to walk through a campsite.  I quickly apologized and shared that the trail appeared to end right between the two RVs we walked past.  She escalated and said if we are going to camp we should know where to go.  I told her she should take it up with the campsite for not having any signs to which she said I was just \u201cmaking fucking excuses.\u201d  At that point I walked back to my site and told her to go back to bed and try to wake up on the right side.  My 4 year old was totally confused about what just happened and I loudly said it was just a grumpy old lady.

That is a no-no.  I suppose if you took the road it would have been a longer walk and that's why you cut through.  Assuming you were quiet, it's too bad the fellow camper didn't take some pity on your plight.  Camping with a bunch of young ones is no easy feat.  Hope you had a grand time, except for the unpleasant morning exchange.", "YTA, kinda*\n\nThis is the most bizarre story ever, because who wants to go tent camping with a bunch of 4 year olds and why would you be camping so far from the bathrooms that you had to cut through 2 people\u2019s campsites to get there?\n\n*I edited because it may not be your fault on the actual camping location, but you still shouldn\u2019t cut through other people\u2019s spaces. Would you have wanted some random person traipsing through your campsite?", "Most rv parks have rules that prohibit walking through other people\u2019s campsites, & you can face immediate eviction with no refund for breaking any of the rules.  Having said that, most people make exceptions for tending to the needs of small children if you were quiet & just apologize nicely.", "YTA, you should\u2019ve gone back to look for the trail but decided you couldn\u2019t see it and your kid needed to pee so you\u2019d just cut through", "YTA. She could have handled it better, but it is against camp etiquette to walk through someone else's site. It is the equivalent of cutting across someone's yard. If you had simply apologized, it would have been E. S. H, but you argued, which is what escalated the situation.", "ESH-  She is 100% correct that camping etiquette (and some campsites) have a rule of not walking through others campsite.   Campsite=house.  You wouldn't walk through someone's home to get to the other side of the street for example.\nShe could have been more understanding and you could have done a quick camping etiquette research.", "Question: you said you walked between two rvs, did you walk between the two spots or was it 2 rvs on the same spot? If it was 2 spots, was the trail between those two spots?", "NTA - Done the campsite camping thing many times. The pathways can get confusing, especially if they're not clearly marked as such. You did nothing intentionally wrong, you apologized for your mistakes.", "NTA. You were nice & apologized & explained that you meant no harm. She's just got issues.", "ESH. Camping etiquette absolutely is do NOT enter other people's camps without permission. Where i am if you see a camp ahead of you and you need to cross you raise your voice and say \"hello?\" When you get attention ask \"permission to pass through \" or \"permission to approach the fire.\" THAT all being said... it sounds like y'all were in a car camping situation, which is where some of the rules are slightly more relaxed... especially when it comes to a kid and bathroom time. That woman should have been far more chill about it.", "YTA\nJust for another perspective I've had people sneak up in the middle of the night shoot at me when I lived out in the rural area.... This is 40 years ago, I hear someone sneaking around my RV..... I get real serious real quick.", "NTA. Generally speaking, it is rude to walk through another person's campsite and you shouldn't do that -  you all pay to rent an area and it's kind of like walking through someone's yard. BUT, the camp's trails should be more clearly marked and you had a kid who needed to go to the bathroom. The lady didn't have to be such a jerk about the situation as long as you didn't touch anything and you were quiet.", "YTA but it was an honest mistake.\n\n You should stick to the public walkways and stay out of people's campsites.  Every campground I've been to has this rule listed in their check in pamphlet.   It sounds like the camper took things a little too far though. There's no need to be mean.   \n\nPeople keep their pets tethered at their sites and their water/sewer lines snake out of their rigs so it's also not necessarily safe for you to walk through anyway.", "YTA. I lived van life for years and people are insanely inconsiderate when it comes to respecting sites in almost every RV park/campground I have stayed at in the US. That woman was 100% fed up with people doing this and I feel her pain. I also used to have an annual RV campsite that was the very furthest from anyone else at the edge a huge wooded campground. The number of people who cut through because it was inconvenient for them to go around to the main path was absurd and I did not hesitate to tell them off. As a woman sleeping alone in the woods, if I heard a single crunch of gravel (that I paid to install), I was at the window immediately. 4-legged animal? Cool. 2-legged animal? Not only is it rude, I don't know if my safety is at risk. You added an extra layer of jerkery for camping with a small child and not having a way for her to go to the bathroom easily at night. At the bare minimum, have a bucket with a seat like you get in disaster kits. They are super cheap.", "YTA. You don\u2019t walk through other peoples campsites.", "NTA.  You apologized and your kid had to pee.", "NTA. You didn't know where you were supposed to walk. She should have left it alone after you apologized.", "YTA.  Don\u2019t walk through other peoples campsites.  Think of it like their home (for a lot of people, it is their home)- you wouldn\u2019t trespass through a neighbors yard.  It\u2019s a privacy and safety issue as well.  You may think it\u2019s not a big deal (although you snuck through quietly hoping not to get caught so you knew it was the wrong thing to do and you did it anyway) but for other people out camping, they may feel vulnerable and protective of their space.", "NTA. You apologized. She is a grumpy old lady.", "NTA.  By the very nature of campsites, this is a potential issue with staying there.", "YTA", "I don't think YTA. You didn't know where to go, and you had to pee. What the hell. If that was me and you were quiet and polite, I wouldn't have said a word. If it was 5 loud people on their 2nd trip, I would've shown them the courteous way to the bathroom. Or made a sign pointing the way. I do think people get up on the wrong side of the bed and need a do over!", "NTA.  What does camping etiquette say about using the f-word in front of a 4YO?  Just when you thought you were safe--Crunchy Granola AH!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When I camp, I do my best to create privacy (where I park the vehicle, where my tent/tarp are, etc) and I expect other campers to respect that as my space while in use. Waltzing through out of convenience isn't acceptable regardless of if your kid needed to pee. \n\nIn the future, make a point of figuring out how to properly get to/from the campground washrooms BEFORE you or your child needs to go. \n\nIt may be the case that following the road will require a longer walk. If that means driving your kid to the bathroom in the future because it's too far for her to walk without cutting though campsites, so be it - you should drive her and deal with the inconvenience on your end instead of inconveniencing others.\n\nEdit: formatting", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH but only a little.
