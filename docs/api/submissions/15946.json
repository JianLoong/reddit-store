It's not a life that everyone is cut out for, and you gave her a chance to see what life would be like before you committed.  My best advice for you is next time date a fellow band instructor (rival schools could make for some spicy romance) or date a band mom who knows exactly what it takes to go the distance.  This marriage won't work because if you give in to her demands and change careers, you will resent her for forcing you to give up your passion in life.

On top of that he's probably pretty good because if your band director isn't good it's almost as bad as your athletics director being bad, and he's been with this for 12 years!

I'd say choose the career, because it's clear its the thing you want to do.

You gave her the chance to see what your schedule is really like. Some people don\u2019t take high school gigs to avoid this and teach in middle school. But marching season isn\u2019t all year. And no matter WHAT level of music you teach, there are outside rehearsals, evening concerts, and other off the school day duties. May is a ridiculous time for music teachers.

However, her ultimatum is a huge red flag and I suggest some marital counseling. Perhaps you are not seeing how much time you aren\u2019t giving her and it\u2019s possible your time at home feels more like a night off than time with her.

Performances are the culminating experience for music students, unlike other subjects where a test or a well-written paper indicates the level of learning that has been accomplished.\n\nI raised four children and taught music full time as well. Our schedules didn't always jive, but we made it work so that everyone met their responsibilities and mom (me) did what I needed to do to ensure my students' success as well.\n\nYou won't be happy changing careers and neither will your wife. She will find something different to complain about. Right now your schedule is her target. If you change your career/schedule, she will find something else to target. I hate to say this, but you would be better off changing wives. She is never going to support you or your life choices. My husband always supported my career (and I supported his) and we made it work as a team. My students loved my husband and knew him as well as they did me because he would stop in at the end of rehearsal with well-deserved treats for the kids. If we had a performance that required moving any kind of equipment, he was there to help. Your wife's lack of interest in your chosen field is not going to work. Thank goodness you don't have children at this point.\n\nI wish I could be more optimistic but I don't see this working out for you. But please don't leave teaching music. I recently returned to teaching music full time (I've been retired since 2016) because one of the schools in our town had no music teacher for this school year. I'm 70 years old but I am loving being back teaching and glad I made this decision. If I hadn't done this, the school would have gone without a music for an entire school year.
