Is there no other way to employ your talents, without being AWOL for extended periods?\n\nThis you have decide for yourself. The internet cannot soften this for you, remove your culpability.

Imagine if you were sick.", "NTA, being the wife of a band director is the same as being a coach's wife in high school,  it's a lot of long weeks, late nights, and supporting them from the stands as you celebrate their triumphs and mourn their losses.  It's not a life that everyone is cut out for, and you gave her a chance to see what life would be like before you committed.  My best advice for you is next time date a fellow band instructor (rival schools could make for some spicy romance) or date a band mom who knows exactly what it takes to go the distance.  This marriage won't work because if you give in to her demands and change careers, you will resent her for forcing you to give up your passion in life. Bring a band director takes dedication and commitment, and walking away from what you LOVE after 12 years for someone who doesn't love you for who you have always been, you will hate her  and you will regret having given up everything and having your marriage fall apart anyway.", "NTA.

They're even in a band together now that they're both retired and play around town, super cute. Not a good career if your partner is co-dependent though, or is expecting 50/50 in child rearing. \n\nOh and NTA OP.", "> Do you love your career more than your wife?\n\nThis sounds remarkably naive ('love conquers all', etc.).\n\nIt's his job.

She knew what she was in for and probably hoped to change him once the ring was on, that's her own fault", "That's what I see, it was the old \"once I have the ring I'll get him to change\" routine.  He gave her a real view of what life would be", "Never have I seen a marching band have early morning practice, it's always evening time during summer and during the school year", "That's a legit question, cause he had to go to school for this, it's not like he just woke up and applied for the job and lucked out.  On top of that he's probably pretty good because if your band director isn't good it's almost as bad as your athletics director being bad, and he's been with this for 12 years! I wish him luck on his next marriage, next time find a single female band director, or a band mom, she will get it.", "Lol not just the summer, if it is a state year almost the entire first semester of school all home life scheduling is dictated by the matching band practices and performances, fellow band parent, high five!", "Holy cow I feel for your school right now, I can't even imagine what would happen if our band directors split", "NTA.

As you said, she discussed this with you **at length** before marriage. She had every opportunity to bow out and seek someone else. While I can certainly suggest building tension and animosity can occur, the fact that she waits until three years in to give you an ultimatum honestly makes it look like she's hoping you'll feel too committed by this juncture to go through with a divorce and thus choose her over your career.\n\nIn my opinion? I'd say choose the career, because it's clear its the thing you want to do. Put differently, could you really say you'd be happy or happy with your wife if you dropped what you've put twelve years of your life into just because she couldn't make up her mind three years ago?

But it\u2019s usually in the context of some one slipping up and accidentally letting the mask drop for a moment and showing their darks sides. This guy hasn\u2019t slipped up, he was totally honest. I respect that and if you follow the advice of that well used comment it is very foolish to go into a relationship thinking someone will change over time (and kind of selfish too, if you love the person as they are then you shouldn\u2019t be hoping for change!).\nI do feel for his wife but lots of folk are married to people in professions with demands on their personal life (doctors, firefighters, military spouses to name just a few!). You choose to accept that person and it\u2019s not fair to ask them to quit something they love because they didn\u2019t change like you hoped they would! \nA big part of a relationship is compromise and it has to go two ways. It sounds like you have tried by altering your schedules over time but if she has decided she no longer wants to accept the compromise. In her place I wouldn\u2019t be attending every event or anything like that but I\u2019d certainly come to support on important ones and that would be my compromise. \nEven if you did quit your job so you think you could get back to a place where you would be happy in your marriage? Would you be able to let go of any resentment for having to quit? Would it even be enough for her or would she realise 6 months down the line that actually she was unhappy for deeper reasons and then you are left with no job and no marriage anyway?! I feel bad for your wife because she is just trying to work out how to be happy but she isn\u2019t being fair. I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say she is an ass hole but you are definitely NTA.", "One of the biggest reasons why my husband chose to teach k-8th grade music instead of music at the high school level. He wanted a life. High school band directors have no life. They work summers, and after school, weekends are often taken up with competitions. and summer is taken up with band camp.  You have to truly love it to do it."]}
