Thanks! NTA, people are quite selective when choosing between religion and culture as you have noticed. When they want something, if one doesn\u2019t work they try the other.

Them telling you to eat dog meat because your grandparents are elder is the same as if your grandparents  told you to drink alcohol or go have sex or murder or steal etc etc. Your grandparents word is not greater than God's -  they cannot re-write the religion - thats blasphemy - so tell that to your dad.", "Today I learned after years of living in a border region with Kazakhstan that eating dog fat is a thing (I've eaten my fair share of kazy and beshbarmak though and it's delicious). My grandma's sister did try to feed me badger fat once when I was little and I threw up on her lap lol\n\nYou are definitely NTA, what you put in your body is no one else's choice but yours, especially when it comes to something so specific.\n\nI know that respect to the elderly is a huge thing in Kazakhstan so you will probably have to be the one to bury the hatchet and come up with an excuse to not eat dog fat anymore, but I sincerely hope that you will be able to stand your ground", "They made my sister drink milk and eat cheese even though she hated both.

I picked this quote up from someone here on Reddit: \u201cRespect your elders even though they\u2019re wrong,\u201d a statement that is meant to point out that your elders are wrong and refuse to admit it and still expect respect, and expect you to continue doing the wrong thing just because they say so.\n\nIf that sounds fucked up to you, imo it\u2019s because it is. Just because they\u2019re older doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re always right. \n\nSadly, them being wrong won\u2019t change, they choose to be indignant. They don\u2019t respect you because of your position in their life, so arguing with them won\u2019t do anything except make them yell at you. Do what you gotta do to be happy. It is sad that they\u2019d rather push their dog fat onto you than see you as a human with autonomy.", "When you said Kazakhstan I first first thought aren't yall Muslims but assumed you might not be since dog meat was involved but you're actually Muslims!

Dog fat has no more health benefits than fat from any other animal, and it is hypocritical for your parents to use Islam to pressure you into eating a haram food.\n\nHow old are you?", "I think it depends. If there\u2019s an imam that the parents or grandparents really trust, then his input might help.", "This isn\u2019t my culture so I really couldn\u2019t say.

Eating an animal that needs to eat other animals to survive is screaming for all kinds of disasters. Ever have a salmonella infection? I thought I would die. \n\nMuslims (at least in the past) had a good idea when they banned pig and meat from animals that died prior to getting slaughtered from their diet. Pig eat EVERYTHING (if people in the countryside of my country wanted to get rid of a body, they throw the person  into the pig enclosure) and therefore were the reason for many diseases. Imagine eating the meat of an animal that ate the meat of a sick prey before (or the deceased body of their owner)", "As stated anything with claws, birds that have talons are haram too. So you can eat chicken but you cannot eat an eagle for example. Also anything that flies without feathers is considered haram such as bats.", "NTA.  I\u2019m a former Muslim.  As soon as you mentioned Islam I burst out laughing at this.  Dog meat, or even HAVING a dog as a pet in most cases is haram.  Dogs are viewed as filthy animals (again this is part of the religion, I actually LOVE LOVE LOVE dogs and want one as a pet more than anything) so eating them would be a very big sin in Islam.  Ask them if they\u2019re trying to send you to hell."]}
