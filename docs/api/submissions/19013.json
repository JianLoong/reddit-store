{"id": 19013, "submission_id": "140tcod", "title": "AITA for making my sister leave the camping trip early because of her dogs?", "selftext": "28m. My sister (46f) has always been a dog nutter. If you take offense to that term, I'm going to assume you are as well. Every year the entire family goes on a giant week long camping trip and each year, we rotate who pays for it. Like last year it was my parents, the year prior was my sister and her husband. This year is me and my wife. We rented 3 campsites. Two tents on each site, just like it is every year (so me + wife + uncle + uncles wife on one, mom +dad + sister + sister's husband + their dogs on one, other sister + her kids + grandma on the other). My sister brings her 2 untrained dogs every single year, as she outright refuses to let her \"son's\" miss out on the fun. She even brings them their own picnic table so they can eat side by side us (the SAME food we eat because she insists that they feel excluded otherwise). \n\nIt's no secret that the dogs being here is a giant burden. Half the shit we want to do, we can't because of the dogs. Usually my poor grandmother gets stuck watching them when we all go out and try to do anything. This year my grandmother has refused (thank God). We told sister well in advance that none of us would be watching these animals for her. This has caused tension because sister keeps trying to guilt us in to changing up our planned activities because her dogs can't go and has tried conning gram in to watching them several times by day 2. This includes even her trying to get us to watch the dogs while she goes to shower, which we have refused then as well. Why? Because she can leave them in her tent. Her dogs, her problem.\n\nBut it really got pushed over the edge yesterday and this is when I told her she had to leave. Everyone is fed up with the dogs but my wife has been the most vocal about it. My wife is visibly disgusted whenever dogs beg for food and my sister didn't get her dogs their plates yet and her bigger dog jumped right up on the table and went for the food my wife was dishing in to her mouth. She ended up with a bloody lip. So, my wife screams out in pain holding her mouth and she took off her flip flop and cocked her arm back and my sister lost her shit. My wife was immediately nose to nose with my sister about the issue. A lot was said. Mainly revolving around my sister being a dog nutter and bringing her untrained dogs around people and ruining everyone's time with these animals. I just ended up telling my sister to leave. We were all done with it. And I made it clear that we wouldn't be allowing her to come next time we pay. I'm being told I took it too far by gram because she's the peace keeper and said she \"regrets not watching the dogs because this never would have happened\".", "created_utc": 1685918918, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140tcod/aita_for_making_my_sister_leave_the_camping_trip/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Was she supposed to sit there and let the dog maul her?", "The dog didn\u2019t attack her. It jumped on the table and tried to take the food.

What a silly analogy.   \n\n\nI read that as the dog jumping up and biting her while trying to bite her food. Regardless, if she felt threatened by the dog, she has the right, again, to pick up anything to use as defense.   \n\n\nAnd to further explain, I don't think it's right to train dogs by hitting them. I was fortunate enough to live above one of the people credited with creating modern day clicker training, and she taught me proper dog training techniques using that clicker method.   \n\n\nRegardless, if someone is threatened by an animal, then that person is allowed to pick up something to defend themselves. If someone is threatened by a toddler, and that toddler isn't Chucky holding a butcher's knife, then that person is a moron and shouldn't be around children.", "Thank you \ud83d\udc4f", "Dogs have been compared to toddlers in terms of \u201chuman type intelligence/communication/whatever\u201d before. \n\nOp clearly hates these dogs. If it was from a bite or attack he likely would have said it so the dogs are seen in a worse light. Same for if she was under attack or needed to defend herself. \n\nIt sounds like the dog jumped up, snatched the food and in the process she got bumped or nipped and then pissed off. She wasn\u2019t fighting for her life here. If she was reaching down for her shoe and getting her face closer to the ground/dog would be dumb. \n\nYou don\u2019t hit animals, especially other people\u2019s pets unless they are actively attacking you.", "You weren't making a legitimate comparison. This was a woman who had just been attacked by a dog. You can use as many euphemisms as you like to describe it and it won't matter. That's what happened.   \n\n\nAgain, you don't hit animals, but she likely thought the dog was not going to stop. Why would it? The food is still there and the dog is still untrained and she's still injured and would potentially get injured again if she wasn't prepared. Note that she took her shoe off and cocked her arm, but didn't actually strike the dog. Hence, it was likely a defensive stance just in case he attacked again.  \n\n\nYou pretending that this scenario is anything like a child accidentally bumping your lip is silly. Why? Because if that happens, you can simply put the child down, or put your hand between their head and your body, or whatever.   \n\n\nThe same cannot be true of a dog that is obviously off leash, obviously aggressive when it comes to food, and obviously has no training to make the dog stop. I never said she had a right to hit the dog for no reason, but she absolutely had the right to grab something to defend herself, again, just in case he attacked again.", "If she was under attack and feared for her life I\u2019m sure OP would have said so because it makes them less the asshole and that\u2019s generally the goal of anyone posting here. \n\nOp said \u201cthe dog went for the food\u201d. \n\nNot the dog is food aggressive, not the dog was attacking his wife. \n\nIn fact the wife and sister \u201cwent nose to nose\u201d and still no mention of a dog attack and most dogs (especially aggressive ones) are going to go nuts to protect their owner. But that didn\u2019t happen. Because there was no major threat to warrant violence with the dog.\n\nEdit : the comparison works because it was likely unintentional by the dog, it was after food and op was in the way, same as if a kid is moving and the wife\u2019s face was in the way. \n\nAnd just like you would \u201cput the child down or put your hand between their head and your face\u201d the way to deal with that situation if your spooked would be to put the food down and step away from the table, not hit the dog.", "If she was under attack? She was attacked. The dog attacked to get the food. And who said she feared for her life? Are you only allowed to defend yourself if you fear for your life? And people post things all the time that don't have the full weight of what's going on. I find it funny that you think anything OP left out automatically means it wasn't serious or wouldn't benefit him in the story.  \n\n\nOP said he went for the food. What that means is that the dog attacked the wife to get the food. You want to downplay this because it works against your assumptions. If they had filed a police report, the report would be listed as a dog attack, not a food aggression issue where someone got injured coincidentally.  \n\n\nIn fact, the wife and sister going nose to nose is irrelevant to why she picked up her flip flop. The wife picked up her flip flop to defend herself in case the dog attacked again, or possibly to reprimand the dog. But the funny thing is that OP didn't mention reprimanding the dog either, so I guess that couldn't be it since he didn't mention it, according to your \"logic\" here. And if the dog was completely calm at this point, once again why didn't he mention it. I guess the dog wasn't calm if he didn't mention it.   \n\n\nAnd no the comparison doesn't work no matter how much you wish it would. One is a simply controlled child, and one is an unruly animal that is much more difficult to subdue. It is absolutely not the same and is still a ridiculous analogy. The average toddler cannot do anywhere near the amount of damage that a dog (of almost any size) can do with one bite.  \n\n\nAnd with a child, you expect things like that. You do not expect a dog, even one that you know is completely untrained, to jump up and snatch food away from you as you are putting it into your mouth. Imagine how freaked out you would be after having a dog snap at your face, causing your lip to bleed. By the way, it was a nice touch how you called it \"a nip\" to avoid admitting that you think the dog bit her.", "NTA. I love dogs, I have two of my own and am child free. That being said, untrained dogs are a nuisance and dangerous to others. If a dog cannot be around food without jumping on the table, it shouldn\u2019t be around when people are eating. \n\nYour sister needs to be careful too. I don\u2019t know where you are based, but in a lot of places if a dog bites and draws blood they are meant to be reported to animal control and if they are shown to not be able to be retrained or still be a danger to the public they can be put down.", "NTA\n\nThis term is perfect for this woman honestly. Two untrained dogs?! And she's forcing everyone to deal with them?! Jesus Christ. \n\nI feel for y'all, and for those animals.. Dogs need training.", "NTA!  I love dogs! Well behaved dogs.  \nYour sister is the AH here for not caring enough to train her dogs and then expecting others to put up with their behaviour. Expecting someone else to miss out on activities to look after the dogs is another level of rude!"]}
