Your bf is attacking you for the natural and normal sounds of your body and telling you to go get surgery? WTF? He's being a huge AH to you.\n\nClearly he needs massive education on EDS and what it does to the joints. And he owes you a huge apology.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand. He loves the *crack* of his and your knuckles but wrists are a bridge too far?\n\nFrankly it sounds like you hit on the truth when you called him out. he realized his shitty attitude  (and maybe his hypocrisy too) and then his brain broke. Sometimes people double down on their shittiness instead of doing a personal inventory of their shittiness. Like, they can't handle the idea that they are less than perfect, so they have to deflect, blame, twist and demand apologies *they* actually owe the *other* person.\n\nI was with someone like this. They'd say something really disturbing, I'd call them out, and then they'd have a complete meltdown. I'd have to explain for daaaays how they hurt me, and it was I that deserved an apology, not the other way around.

It's cute he thinks you can control it but you need to dump this guy, it's never going to get better and you cannot help it.\n\nOur joints just wiggle and slip and subluxate and roll, lock and freeze. It's literally the medical condition we share and only gets worse with age. \n\nThis guy is an uneducated, selfish AH. He's not the one. You can't stop your joints from cracking but you can get rid of this guy and find a better man. \n\nIf it's annoying him now, wait until you're my age (41). I make noise constantly when I move. \n\nAlso my kid has it, because it's genetic. If he yells at you for pops, he'd yell at your children too.\n\nHe's not the guy, my wonky jointed friend.

Hate to be the bearer of bad newsvbut it sounds like your BF might be getting tired of the relationship if he's getting pissy over something so minor it should even be registered.

You clearly don\u2019t have control over this kind of popping, and he usually knows that. He\u2019s projecting his bad mood onto you in a very unhealthy way.", "NTA. That your bf knows so little about eds, while he says he cares about you, I find it striking.\nIf my partner had a fairly unknown condition, I would have educated myself about that condition. You do that out of love and concern.", "NTA\n\nhis intense reaction to this is cause for concern though. It's literally outside of your control. And, on top of that, he's a hypocrite because he CHOOSES to pop his and isn't bothered by the noise, but when you do it accidentally its worth him blowing up over.", "NTA\n\n\nBut your bf is. \n\n\nTell him to look up empathy, and give it a go. Bet that'll go down well!", "NTA. Surgery often won't \"fix\" EDS issues anyway, unless there is an underlying issue you'venot mentioned. \n\nBut perhaps reconsider if he actually understands your condition.", "NTA. Your boyfriend doesn't seem to be mature enough to be in a relationship right now.\n\nHe would rather double down on his tantrum rather than realize not everything that happens has an intent behind it. Sometimes shit just happens. Bones don't just pop in your hands when you crack your knuckles, every single mobile joint in your body has the potential to pop. If he can't stand that noise, then perhaps being with someone with hypermobility isn't the best idea.", "My hubby flinches when I'm trying to get my wrist to clunk back into place but he understands why\n\nNTA", "NTA, but he sure is. I have misophonia and my bf\u2019s ankles and toes pop like fireworks sometimes. While it\u2019s not a pleasant sound, your bf\u2019s reaction is appalling.

He wants you to have surgery to fix something that makes an annoying sound.(Even the most innocuous surgery can have complications or cause death).  \n\nDoes he also get upset if you pass gas near him? If you sneeze? Snore when you have a cold?\n\nI'm sorry but I would tell him, you are NOT having surgery for something that's annoying not debilitating.  That you won't risk your life, limb or income(recovery time post surgery) just to make less noise.  \n\nI'd also tell him \"*Suck it up, buttercup*.\" But that's me.  \n\nPS I consider his behavior big RED flag.", "NTA.   \"You should undergo a painful, invasive procedure to keep you from making a sound that I find annoying.\"   Yeah, you're right - he's not suggesting surgery as a solution for you -- it's a convenience for him.   EDS has no cure, correct?  It's going to be a long, cold life with this guy as your partner.", "Absolutely not!  Popping knuckles is a bad habit.
