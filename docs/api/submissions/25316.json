My alarm goes off every 5 minutes for 30 or more minutes. While I don't get up I'm not really awake. Sometimes I fall deep asleep in those 5 minutes. It's not up to you to decide when someone is awake.", "I need to have my alarm go off every 5 minutes for 30 minutes (sometimes more) before I actually wake up. Had anyone knocked on my door at the time I would be furious and I would completely ignore your request.\n\nHad they come to me at a normal time and explained it to me, I would be apologetic and would try to make sure the alarm wouldn't bother them.", "Sure, but in an apartment/shared wall or floor situation, you don't let alarms go for 30+ min.

That is showing no respect for your neighbours.", "You are welcome", "It\u2019s also not up to them to decide when I wake up either", "It\u2019s up to the alarm setter to avoid doing things that unnecessarily inconvenience his neighbors.

But what you did was absolutely the wrong way to go about it, it will most likely have the opposite effect. You just pissed off the person from whom you wanted sympathy.", "Annoying the person from whom you want sympathy is absolutely the worst way of getting them to do what you want.\n\nThat's all I'm saying. If I were the neighbour and OP would have approached me at a normal time I'd be apologetic and change the way I did things to try and not disturb them. The way OP did things, I would not only continue doing what I was doing and stop being careful about noise all together.", "You have an issue, you want sympathy from another person so that you stop having that issue as they are under no obligation to oblige. Pissing them off is absolutely the wrong way to go about it.\n\nAs I've said as a response to other people, I am very careful about not disturbing my neighbours. But we all do things that disturb them without even realizing it. If I were the neighbour and OP had approached me at a normal time I would be apologetic and would change my ways. The way OP did it, I would continue to do it the same way and would definitely stop being careful about noise completely (under legal obligations of course).\n\nYou catch more flies with honey and that sort of thing.", "It depends on the reason why it's there. Maybe the neighbour doesn't have a night stand and needs to have it on the floor and hasn't even considered it would annoy others.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that OP went about it the wrong way. They did it in a way that put the neighbour against them, instead of on a empathic mode. I hate knowing I'm disturbing my neighbours and I'm very careful about that. There still may be stuff I do that disturbs them and I'm not aware. If they woke me up at 5:30 to tell me that, I would make sure to disturb them on purpose.", "Because that's not how my brain works. I'm not the only one lol Lots of people work like that. Some people wake up the moment their alarms go off. Some people need the alarm to go off several times. Different people work in different ways.\n\nIf you want them pissed at you and shitting on your concerns you do what you have done. I'm always careful about not disturbing my neighbours. If I were your neighbour and you had approached me at a proper time with your concern I would be very apologetic and make sure to not leave the phone on the floor and make sure I'd find another way. If you did to me what you did to them, I'd be start having 0 concerns with your well being and actually started disturbing you on purpose, out of pettiness.", "It\u2019s not about sympathy, it\u2019s about getting them to turn off their alarm in a timely fashion.", "The OP doesn't want alarm abuser's sympathy. He wants the jerk to observe the common sense rules of apartment style living. Alarm abuser is NOT being careful about noise whatsoever. \n\nI'd make my next call to the landlord.", "> The way OP did it, I would continue to do it the same way and would definitely stop being careful about noise completely (under legal obligations of course).\n\nThat\u2019s a great way to get a complaint filed against you.", "> If you did to me what you did to them, I'd be start having 0 concerns with your well being and actually started disturbing you on purpose, out of pettiness.\n\nThis just makes you sound like a huge asshole. Your neighbor\u2019s sleep is irrevocably affected that morning, but because they had the gall to wake you up as well you\u2019re gonna continue the behavior?", "And why should they do that if not just to make OP's life easier?\n\nOP needs something from the neighbour and the neighbour isn't mandated to oblige. So they do need their sympathy.", "Oh but he does. The neighbour has an alarm going off, which is just on vibrate. No one in the police department would tell him he can't.\n\nSo he needs the neighbour sympathy so that he changes his ways to make OP's life easier.", "If I'm following all legal obligations there's nothing you can do.", "Yes, it's not being an AH, it's being petty.\n\nIf they don't care about my well-being (they knocked on my door at 5:30 am), then I will not care about theirs either. It goes both ways.", "Your logic makes no sense\u2014in that case OP can still keep knocking to wake up the neighbor at that hour. And since the neighbor\u2019s alarm is what\u2019s waking them up in the first place they\u2019re justified.\n\nBesides, a noise complaint can be filed with the landlord. Enough violations, the neighbor risks eviction. It\u2019s easier for everyone involved to just not put the phone on the floor.", "If the vibration is rattling the ceiling and making loud noise (which it seems like it is), then a noise complaint can actually be filed with the landlord.", "OP can complain to the landlord or managing agent, who can do wtf they like and are not connected with local government. Noise rules are much more strict in apartments for situations like this. In NYC, most rental agreements stipulate you have to put down rugs and shit over 80% of your floor surface to help dampen sound. \n\nIt's abundantly clear you haven't lived in an apartment before.", "Legal obligations and terms of a lease are completely different things. In apartment (and most rental units really) you abide by certain rules that have no threshold on legality.", "That is being an AH\u2014you\u2019re the one inconveniencing them in the fist place, why should you be upset they\u2019re inconveniencing you when they just want to go back to sleep?", "It's easier for everyone involved to speak with their neighbours at proper times and in a proper manner. But that ship has sailed.\n\nHe can file a complaint. If the noise is under the law then OP has no legal bearing.", "Sure, they can measure the dB and make a complaint if they go over it, which I bet it won't.", "And if the neighbour is not fulfilling any of those written rules, then he needs to stop. Do you know the terms of the lease? AFAIK there was no mention of those.\n\nUnless the lease terms specify he can't a specific kind of noise and he does it, then he doesn't have to. And saying \"no noise is appropriate\" doesn't make sense. If I go to the WC in the middle of the night I can flush the toilet even if it wakes the neighbour up.", "I'm at my own home, doing my own thing. If nothing I'm doing goes against any written rule or law, then others can ask me to change it, not demand it. And if you do it when I'm sleeping, you can be sure my answer will be no.", "Again, you clearly don\u2019t really understand apartment living\u2014it being legal or not has nothing to do with the terms of the lease. When I say file a complaint I mean _with the landlord_.\n\nETA: Actually one other thing to consider\u2014if OP has evidence and has indicated in writing that the alarm is overly disruptive to the neighbor and the pattern continues,  could cross into being considered harassment from a legal standpoint.", "It doesn\u2019t really require a dB rating to show the landlord it\u2019s disruptive at an early hour. The dB thing is only really pertinent to noise complaints with the police.", "Just about every lease I\u2019ve come across has provisions on quiet hours that specifies one can\u2019t be overly disruptive to their neighbors.\n\n> If I go to the WC in the middle of the night I can flush the toilet even if it wakes the neighbour up.\n\nFalse equivalence\u2014some noise in an apartment is to be expected (ie. getting up to get ready for work at an early hour, etc). A phone rattling the floorboards and ceiling for 30 minutes is well outside that reasonable threshold."]}
