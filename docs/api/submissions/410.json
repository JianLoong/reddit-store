When people say \u201cI don\u2019t want a boyfriend [at this time]\u201d, it generally has two meanings. The obvious being that they don\u2019t want to be tied down, but it\u2019s also because they know someone (you, in this case) is pushing for something and they don\u2019t want to hurt you.\n\nIt sucks, certainly, but you need to get over it. Your best friend doesn\u2019t owe you a relationship and she absolutely doesn\u2019t owe you celibacy. Let her live her life and stop hanging out with her until you get over her. Otherwise you\u2019ll lose her friendship.", "YTA. \"If I can't have her, no one can\" is a shit attitude and probably she's not your \"best friend\" anymore, either. That said, maybe a sober conversation is in order?", "YTA. You don\u2019t own her. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re not really friends with her. Are you waiting around, clinging to a friendship until she likes you? That\u2019s not friendship. You need to accept she doesn\u2019t feel the same about you move on", "YTA for the reason\u2019s already given by everyone else", "YTA. You don't have any right to tell them (or anyone else) they can't see each other. Just because YOU will get hurt doesn't mean you can try to control other people's choices. What if you were in their shoes? Would you feel that your friend would be right to tell you you can't date someone you were very interested in because she wouldn't like it? I think not. Nobody would.", "Just get rid of her entirely. Its gonna be hard but its for the best. You shot your shot and she said no. She will always look at you as a best friend, but not as a partner. Youre feelings for her are never gonna go away if you dont distance yourself from her. You will say she's your best friend and dont wanna lose that. But deep down we both know you just want her to be yours.", "YTA, if you want her you need to tell her, if you don\u2019t she can go out with whoever she wants.", "YTA get over it", "It sounds like you got friendzoned\nThe best thing to do is suck up your pride, support them and get over your feeling towards her since theyre not both ways\nLet them have a happy relationship\nSomething like this isnt worth ruining a 14 year friendship over", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
