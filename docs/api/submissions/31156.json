You didn\u2019t make it about her being gross, you made it about how she may not be able to afford hygiene products or whatever right now, and I think that\u2019s actually really sweet of you. \n\nIf you had been like \u201cI\u2019m concerned about your hygiene, I don\u2019t want a dirty person here\u201d, I\u2019d think differently. \n\nI\u2019d say Laura is the A H but when you live with people for awhile, you just talk. That\u2019s how it is. Ideally, everyone would mind their business, but in reality, it\u2019s tough. Especially for Laura since her life occurs mostly just there in the apartment.", "NTA - IT seems to have come from a place of care and consideration with you, and intent matters.  \n\n\nYour roommate is nosy, and probably does need to mind her own business, but again what is the intent here?\n\n  \nIt's also perfectly possible to keep up a GREAT level of hygiene in the way your roommate is describing. I'm doing a down-to-studs remodel on my only bathroom with a shower in my house, and as a result I haven't had a shower at home in basically a month now. \n\nI shower at the gym every single day, even if I don't work out.   \n\n\nI smell awesome, lol.", "Slight YTA.\n\nI get that you were concerned but if Anne went 2 months without showering you would know.", "Sounds like Laura is an instigator, Nta but if I were Anne I would be put off by that even if you were respectful about it in all honesty", "NTA.\n\nI do the same out of consideration for the water and heating bills whenever I\u2019m in a roommate situation.  I pay for my gym membership and take as long a shower I want after my workout.  I\u2019m not bothered by sharing a bathroom at home and I have no cleaning responsibilities in the bathroom aside from making sure I don\u2019t leave a mess behind me.", "Slight YTA, you listened to gossip and believed it despite Anne not looking or smelling bad. Take it as a life lesson.", "Anne is 22. She can monitor her own hygiene. \n\nYTA for overstepping", "YTA if she wasn\u2019t showering, you would know. After a week your whole apartment would smell bad. It\u2019s definitely weird to never shower at home, but as long as she isn\u2019t causing problems with smell then it\u2019s none of your business.", "Your NTA i think ITS perfectly fine how you handled the Situation.\nAnd Missing Hygiene could BE a Symptom of a mental illness \n\nBut your disabled roommate IS an asshole for talking behind the Back of your other roommate", "NAH -\nA lot of people seem to think that it\u2019s none of your business or you over stepped but a decline in hygiene practices can be a sign someone is struggling. I would also ask if they are okay (I may put it more delicately). Caring about people is important.", "nta", "YTA. \n\nWhile you were very respectful in your approach, her personal hygiene is none of your business. You said yourself she doesn't smell or anything, so what does it matter? Also, your other roommate definitely needs to mind her business as well. Neither of you watch your friend use the toilet but you don't assume they just don't, right? Same concept. Had she been stinking up the place, then I could see the need for a talk, but otherwise she's right and you have zero business discussing her personal hygiene.", "I'm kind of mixed opinion on this one. When it comes to personal hygiene it's a very private and highly embarrassing subject. Insinuating that somebody has poor hygiene, even if you try to do it in a gentle manner, is a horrific thing and will probably linger between the two of you for a very long time.\n\nI kind of wonder how you thought the conversation was going to go? She was going to tell you that she never showered and she liked it that way and then you were going to lecture her about how to not be nasty or something? I mean how did this go in your head?\n\nYou also specified that she didn't smell or anything. People who never shower you can tell. It just seems extremely invasive. The only reason I'm not saying that you are the asshole is because I realize that you were trying to be caring and helpful but that doesn't make it any less of a hurtful and highly personal subject. Also sounds like your other roommate is a creepy obsessive snitch", "YTA. It's just gossip. It was impacting you in no way. Mind your own business.", "NAH. It is curious after all, but you could have asked without assuming something was *wrong*.", "YTA. It's understandable that you were concerned about Anne's hygiene, but it seems like you jumped to conclusions without considering other possibilities. It's great that Anne clarified the situation and explained that she showers at the gym after work. Lesson learned - next time, try to communicate directly with the person involved before making assumptions.", "NAH but you definitely may have damaged your relationship with her.    Next time take more time to think about context clues -If she never showered she'd obviously smell", "YTA - but Laura is more so though for starting it all.", "NAH. Disabled roommate likely brought it up out of concern for other roommate because she noticed an oddity in the expected norm. You were kind about how you brought it up. I might have worded differently, maybe ask if there was an issue with the bathroom itself or something, so it\u2019s not so much \u201chey, roomy- are you poor?\u201d But, it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone\u2019s an ah here.", "yeah YTA. it was one thing if she was smelly or something, but if there was an issue there is no need to create a problem out of thin air.", "NAH - Laura might need to be told to mind her own business, and she seems to think she can just bring issues to you and you solve them? \n\nAs i was reading this I thought the same, she probably showers at the gym.  But I don't think you were an AH for bringing it up as you seemed to care, but maybe second guess whether this is a problem to solve or just someone's personal business that doesn't impact you as roommates.", "YTA, you yourself said Anne didn't smell, and you had absolutely no reason to assume there was a hygiene situation. It's none of your business if and when she showers if it's not affecting you.", "YTA. If Laura is \u201cconcerned\u201d she can ask. It\u2019s none of your business.", "YTA. Wow. That was so rude.

It\u2019s fantastic that you care and were willing to have an awkward conversation out of concern for a friend, but if she seems like she\u2019s relatively clean, she probably is.", "YTA if she doesn't smell and is not unhygienic in any other way to create issues as a roommate it's not your business. And your other roommate should mind her own business as well. Gossip sucks.", "I think I'm leaning towards YTA. You started with an assumption and it ended up with an accusation.\n\nI've worked with someone who said he goes to the gym to take long hot showers. He said he goes daily. I suppose it saves on energy bills at home, and his gym membership was a company perk so it didn't cost him anything to have it.\n\nI also used to live in a place where the water was shut off from time to time because of issues. Construction, frozen pipes, replacing aging pipes, etc. Work had a shower in the bathroom since it was a facility where you can get dirty and using their showers wasn't half bad.", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like you and your roommate were trying to start problems where no problems existed. You had no reason to assume there was an issue, and you even noted that there were no hygiene issues.", "YWBTA for listening to Laura and apparently with whom you share having no sense, sense of smell or having a life for that matter.", "YTA, your roommate had no other symptoms of hygiene issues so you should have just left her alone. I suggest reminding your other roommate to gossip less.", "NTA.  Anne would get her ass beat in prison for not showering and brushing her teeth every day.  Poor hygiene is disrespectful to roommates.  Even convicts with questionable scruples recognize the importance.", "I would have tried to smell her before doing anything. (Edit: /s for what I thought was an obvious joke)\n\nYTA.", "Why did you both assume she wasn't showering at the gym?\n\nIf you both just totally overlooked that possibility and assumed she was very unhygienic, maybe YTA.", "NTA. People forget that assumption is very much an ordinary thing that everyone does.\nPeople will always speculate something about a person as soon as they notice something small that's different from their standard. It's pretty much a harmless thing to do *most* of the time. When you start stating what you assume as facts, that's where things hit the fan. There's a right way to assume and a wrong way to assume.\n\nYou did the right type of assumption cause rather than believing your other roommate and making the same assumption that she made about her being unhygienic, you asked. You were concerned if she needed help, and now you know. \n\nAnne seems like the person who likes keeping her life and what she does more private than most. The problem was never there in the first place, Laura was just being nosey, in my opinion.", "Eh, NTA. It really is super weird to only shower at the gym, but also this is why having roommates sucks.", "NTA, but Laura is. She definitely needs to mind her own business.", "You are the asshole.", "NTA because you started asking if she needed help.  It sounds like it came from a place of caring.", "Nope OPs the AH. I've had roommates so this crap. When I was in college I was even reported to the student conduct office because my roommates decided I didn't wash my hair enough. Unless OPs roommate has body order issues or is overall being unclean it's none of her business. Also some people keep bath stuff in their room.", "> It's also perfectly possible to keep up a GREAT level of hygiene in the way your roommate is describing\n\nDepending on the roommate's situation, it might even be easier.  OP mentions that the roommate has a disability. Lots of gyms have a wider-than-normal shower stall for people with wheelchairs, crutches, or just any type of mobility restrictions.  Just having a walk-in shower instead of one of those shower/tub situations could make it much easier.", "Never Heard of mental illnesses? \nNot Monitoring own Hygiene IS often Part of Depression \ud83d\ude05", "\". Lesson learned - next time, try to communicate directly with the person involved before making assumptions.\"\n\nIsnt that exactly what op did \ud83d\ude05", "Right. My uncle who lives with my mom (and me as well until I moved out) has to my knowledge, used the washer and dryer once and has never, that I know of, showered in the over 20 years he's lived with my mom. Is that weird? Yes, absolutely. Does he smell? Thankfully not so I've never said anything.", "Yeah, I guess since Laura is home all day every day, I figured she would know. Shouldn't have jumped to the conclusion", "It's weird to go to the gym daily and take a shower in the gym right after working out?! What's wrong with you?!\ud83d\ude02", "Not sure why you're being down voted. OP is definitely an AH for listening to gossip from her roommate. And besides, if you've never had any issues with her smelling, why would it matter if she's not showering or whatever? If it doesn't affect you, then why even care?\n\nAlso, just to add context from my perspective... I was the smelly kid in school with greasy hair and lots of acne because we (it was just my mother and I) were EXTREMELY POOR, and because my drug addict and alcoholic mother never taught me physical or oral hygiene (or the importance of those things). It wasn't until the first brutally honest girl turned me down and gave me a list of reasons why that I realized I had also slept through anything resembling health classes (like the puberty one they give in your last year of elementary) because my mom smoked meth and I didn't sleep much at home.\n\nAnd every time I lived with roommates after my first time, I kept all my hygiene stuff for the shower in my room because roommates steal shit and there's only so many times you can find out your roommate has been washing his junk with your soap instead of buying his own before you stop leaving it out (literally, had to take care of this guy drunk, put him in the shower and he got undressed and actually started showering, and proceeded to wash his junk with my soap, putting the bar directly on his skin).", "Yes however the entire encounter was based on Laura never witnessing Anne take a shower. Even OP states that Anne didn\u2019t smell and there is no mention of a dirty or greasy appearance.", "So what??? I had severe depression. Went a long time with now shower very often. It was nobody's business except my own. If I smell, okay, bring that up nicely. But I can not shower for as long as I want because it in no way effects you sans smell. And I did wipe up the bits and armpits every day. Anyway, they are not her mother. If she does not shower for 2 months it is NONE of their frickin business.", "Lol, nah they don't expect OP to communicate anything. \n\nThere are so many different and worse ways OP could've done this, but people need to accept that if you live with people you may have to address uncomfortable topics. The way it's described, OP did a quick check in to make sure everything's good.", "For context, I say to my knowledge but about the showering I'm 99.9 percent sure about it as we shared a bathroom up until 3 years ago and had the same wake/sleep/work schedule. But who knows lol", "I feel like AH is a very strong word for your part in this, so please keep being a great friend and caring person.
