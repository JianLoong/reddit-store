Had she been stinking up the place, then I could see the need for a talk, but otherwise she's right and you have zero business discussing her personal hygiene.", "I'm kind of mixed opinion on this one. When it comes to personal hygiene it's a very private and highly embarrassing subject. Insinuating that somebody has poor hygiene, even if you try to do it in a gentle manner, is a horrific thing and will probably linger between the two of you for a very long time.\n\nI kind of wonder how you thought the conversation was going to go? She was going to tell you that she never showered and she liked it that way and then you were going to lecture her about how to not be nasty or something? I mean how did this go in your head?\n\nYou also specified that she didn't smell or anything. People who never shower you can tell. It just seems extremely invasive. The only reason I'm not saying that you are the asshole is because I realize that you were trying to be caring and helpful but that doesn't make it any less of a hurtful and highly personal subject. Also sounds like your other roommate is a creepy obsessive snitch", "YTA. It's just gossip. It was impacting you in no way. Mind your own business.", "NAH.

People forget that assumption is very much an ordinary thing that everyone does.\nPeople will always speculate something about a person as soon as they notice something small that's different from their standard. It's pretty much a harmless thing to do *most* of the time. When you start stating what you assume as facts, that's where things hit the fan. There's a right way to assume and a wrong way to assume.\n\nYou did the right type of assumption cause rather than believing your other roommate and making the same assumption that she made about her being unhygienic, you asked.

And besides, if you've never had any issues with her smelling, why would it matter if she's not showering or whatever? If it doesn't affect you, then why even care?\n\nAlso, just to add context from my perspective... I was the smelly kid in school with greasy hair and lots of acne because we (it was just my mother and I) were EXTREMELY POOR, and because my drug addict and alcoholic mother never taught me physical or oral hygiene (or the importance of those things). It wasn't until the first brutally honest girl turned me down and gave me a list of reasons why that I realized I had also slept through anything resembling health classes (like the puberty one they give in your last year of elementary) because my mom smoked meth and I didn't sleep much at home.\n\nAnd every time I lived with roommates after my first time, I kept all my hygiene stuff for the shower in my room because roommates steal shit and there's only so many times you can find out your roommate has been washing his junk with your soap instead of buying his own before you stop leaving it out (literally, had to take care of this guy drunk, put him in the shower and he got undressed and actually started showering, and proceeded to wash his junk with my soap, putting the bar directly on his skin).", "Yes however the entire encounter was based on Laura never witnessing Anne take a shower.

It was nobody's business except my own. If I smell, okay, bring that up nicely. But I can not shower for as long as I want because it in no way effects you sans smell.

That way, she wouldn't be basically telling Ann to her face \"I don't think you have any bathroom essentials so I am offering my aid.\" But the fact that OP's assumption was \"oh, she must not have anything\" instead of \"maybe she just keeps her stuff on her room\" is a bit iffy. \n\nIt's not the worst thing in the world, but it *can* be pretty condescending when ppl think you need their help-especially with an issue like this-despite no real or clear evidence suggesting that.", "I understand that, but there's also the age old saying of \"keeping your nose out of other people's business\". \n\nOP even said that they never actually smell bad. How would someone never shower but never smell bad? There's only so much you can cover up BO. Trust me, read my above comment because I definitely have experience with this.", "So she's a shit stirrer. That's your *actual* problem.", "Some people genetically don't really produce significant BO.  Its especially common in Japanese people to the point where they test for it when assigning military personnel to submarines.", "> \"keeping your nose out of other people's business\".\n\nThen get your own god damn apartment. If you live with people, your business is their business.", "The person with the disability is not the same person that's not showering at home. They're two different people", "And you're assuming the smaller portion rather than the majority and literally just TRYING to argue. And I'm definitely done with it. Lmao", "YTA. Have a brain. It's impossible to not stink if you don't shower.\n\nAnd as someone who during a long time didn't shower because of depression, I can tell you dead skin cells begin to accumulate quickly and are fairly noticieable.", "These are all normal discussions between roommates. You seem like you handled it in a civil manner. NTA.", "Yes and No.  You meant well.  But if she wasn\u2019t bathing you would definitely know so it was kinda an asshat move.", "Years ago I shared a house with two men, and one of them didn't have a toothbrush in the bathroom.\n\nI brought it up one day and found out he didn't need one.  He wore a full set of dentures and had a special cleaning brush for them that he kept in his bedroom and a box to soak them in while he slept.\n\nD'oh!  But we were both having a great time chatting about it and he had a really good story about how he ended up with no teeth at 40.  He had some dental problems in his late teen years and wanted dentures just so he didn't have to deal with the pain anymore but they were expensive.  One of his friends challenged him to save up for a year and get all his teeth pulled and dentures made.  He gave up alcohol for a year when he was 18 and put all his drink money into a savings account and there you go!  A pain-free shiny smile :)", "NTA \n\nLaura should have minded her own business. If there was no issue, there was no need to talk to Anne.", "I'll go with NAH because you approached this in a kind way without ill intent. However I'm surprised you and Laura would assume Anne never showers, when the more obvious answer is she does it somewhere else since she doesn't smell bad (e.g. at a boyfriend's or the gym as it were).", "NAH...   man you are a clear direct communicator...  be yourself and kick ass!", "NAH, everyone sounds concerned! People are saying mind your business but I always checked up with my roommates on mental health/if they're struggling with anything", "YTA. Mind your own showering habits.", "YAAAH", "NTA\n\nYou heard something and asked the source for clarification. (Although, there should becsoap gor hand washing in all bathrooms no matter where you shower.)\n\nThe only possible asshole is Laura for not just asking Anne instead of gossiping to Opie.", "YTA. If someone hasn't showered for two months, you would know it. Her hair would have been super greasy for sure. She also would have smelt. You should have just pointed out this obvious fact to Laura.", "Why on earth didn\u2019t Laura, after living with Anne for a week or two not just ask where she showers and such? It seems like a reasonable question if your roommate isn\u2019t using the bathroom you share.", "My first thought was that Anne probably showered somewhere else, like at a gym, especially after you said she didn't seem dirty.  I agree with Anne that Laura needs to mind her own business.  If Anne seems fine now, just let it go and try not to make assumptions about people in the future without getting more information.   Also, Laura sounds like she needs a life.  Why did she have to share her concerns with you?  Why didn't she ask Anne about it herself without gossiping with you first? NTA, you made an honest mistake, but learn from it and don't be a partner to Laura's gossip anymore.", "I agree. Other people have suggested OP isn\u2019t the AH because they were genuinely concerned about their roommate, but I don\u2019t buy that. They don\u2019t even know her well enough to know that she goes to the gym every single day!! \n\nIt\u2019s super weird to monitor your roommate\u2019s shower schedule, but never even bother to have a normal conversation with them. If either of them had ever talked to Anne about her life, I\u2019m sure they would know that she frequents the gym.", "Yeah, I cannot *imagine* involving myself in this.", "This is what I thought, if the roommate is nosy enough to make such a conclusion off of schedule observation and not pointing to tangible issues (smelly roommate, filth in common spaces, hoarded trash, etc) - I wouldn\u2019t trust them to not go through or tamper with my things.", "I used to do this even just when I lived with my parents and siblings! I made myself a shower caddy because they\u2019d use so much of my favourite products that I bought myself and not realize mom and dad didn\u2019t buy it for everyone (or just not care and say if it\u2019s in the house it\u2019s for everyone) and I also would get up way earlier than the rest of the house so I could get in and out of the only bathroom with a shower before my 3 brothers got up. They spent more time on their appearance than I did and while I had a mirror and stuff set up in my room, they didn\u2019t care and always hogged the bathroom using everything in there so I learned to change how I did things so I could do it my way without having to wait ages for them and go to school feeling gross lol Anne could have been showering at other times of day/night as well", "I thought the same thing! It can be hard to find accessible rentals so I thought, good thinking on the roomie's part. Oops. \ud83d\ude43", "Sure. But they don\u2019t even know Anne well enough to know about an activity that she does every single day (going to the gym). They obviously aren\u2019t friends. So I don\u2019t buy that they were concerned about her mental health.", "OP didn\u2019t \u201cdone it\u201d.  OP \u201cdid it\u201d.", "I can see why op said that Anne seems off with Laura.    \nfrom comment<<Anne has been rather short with her since this went down>>", "OP asked if she needed help buying stuff. He's NTA by any means, the other roomate is. \nHe never noticed anything and tried to be considerate thinking he missed something", "Thank you for pointing this out. Everyone always goes to the hair and it\u2019s just not true for everybody. \n\nI\u2019m black and I usually wash my hair around once a month or so. Nobody wouldn\u2019t be able to tell at all.", "I was basing it off the fact the OP and the roommate was surprised that she didn't have shower gel and shampoo in the shower. If Anna had curly hair, then I'm sure they'd mention the fact as people with curly hair usually have a whole host of different products as part of their routine, at least in my experience.", "Well, Laura's probably PO'd she can't steal Anne's shampoo, conditioner. etc., like she did with previous roommates.\n\n(No evidence, just made thst up because  . . .)", "Okay, but people with even an ounce of common sense realize that someone would not look perfectly clean and smell fine if they hadn't showered in weeks, let alone months that OP and the other roommate seemed to think.\n\nI actually agree that if Anne looked greasy or smelled or anything else that suggested she wasn't taking basic care of her hyenine, a gentle conversation about if she was okay was in order. But I can't wrap my mind around OP and her roommate not being ablet to figure out that a clean person is obviously bathing somewhere (and the gym would be my first thought, since plenty of people shower after workouts).", "Wrong roommate. Laura is the disabled roommate but she thought Anne hadn't been showering.", "People who wash their hair super often produce more grease to make up for it.", "Oh, right, I misread that. Good catch, at least that takes that element out of play.", "Yeah thats a dog eating the tail problem and it happens because people wrongly assume they have an oily scalp. But people who do have one do need to wash their hair more than once a week.", "Not to mention, there are other ways to keep hygenic and clean besides just taking a shower.  People with skin issues like eczema are often told by doctors to shower once every 3 days or once a week and maintain their hygiene in other ways, since water and soaps disrupt the horned layer of skin. Plus, the disabled roommate can watch as hard as she wants, but she's still human and has to sleep. There are hours every day where she would have no clue what's going on in the apartment."]}
