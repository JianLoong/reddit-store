I understand that you have money coming but money tomorrow doesn't solve problems today and it was to help those problems today she let you move in. And it is both unreasonable and disrespectful to use your ill grandmother as an excuse not to pay your debts. \n\nI understand you don't get on and you were stressed. But ever consider she is stressed too - she seems to be a single Mum, struggling, has a son and now is being stiffed on money by someone who is making promises to pay at some time.\n\nI am sorry your Grandmother is ill and your car is broken down but rent still needs to be paid. You unilaterally decided she could carry your debt until it best suited you to pay.

It sounds to me like OP was paying more than her fair market value in the first place since she wasn\u2019t occupying half of the house. The sister also likely didn\u2019t adhere to giving proper notice to leave as a landlord so I\u2019m sure if it went to court, the sister would be penalized not OP.

What planet are you living on?\n\nThe rest of what you\u2019re saying is mostly assumption and due to how OP is in the post, it\u2019s hard to imagine her being in the right. Doesn\u2019t matter- the *right* thing to do is to pay the 600 and move on. Not doing that would just make OP a self-righteous asshole."]}
