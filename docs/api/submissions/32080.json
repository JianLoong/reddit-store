Our relationship became financially abusive after he convinced me to become a STAHM when our son (16 months) was born. When I caught him cheating in march (had been going on since the beginning of my pregnancy) I told him I no longer wanted to be with him and absolutely needed to get a job and start making my own money. I ask if we could remain roommates and I find a job with opposite hours from him, He said no if I didn\u2019t want to be with him then get out. I ask if I could have some time to get back on my feet first, he said no. So I had no choice but to move back and stay with family. Since I moved he sees our son around every 4-6 weeks for a couple of hours and sends $200 biweekly for him. My ex is not on our son\u2019s birth certificate and has no custody rights.\nUsually when he visits I meet him much closer to his place, although one time we met halfway and he\u2019s met closer to me twice. Ive taken my son to his great grandparents house once since moving. It\u2019s 3+ hours away and traffic was awful in that area like it always is because of construction that\u2019s been going on forever. It was a disaster and his grandma said she was tired and ready for us to leave within two hours.\n\n\nNow the current situation: my ex ask me to bring our son to his grandparents house on Dec 23rd for Christmas. I told him absolutely not, traffic is already horrendous on a normal weekend and I don\u2019t even want to imagine it the Saturday before Christmas, and I don\u2019t want to have to strap my active toddler in a car seat for what would likely be a 4 hour trip where he would cry and scream. The 23rd is also the day of my parents annual party which they knew.\n\n\n I told him if he wanted me to come to his grandparents house it would have to be after Christmas, but I would meet them at my ex\u2019s apartment sometime before Christmas, or they could all come to my parents (at or before the party) on the 23rd. He didn\u2019t like any of those ideas and said he\u2019d just tell his family they don\u2019t get to see our son at Christmas and how messed up it was. He says his apartment is too small for everyone, but I use to live there and my family, which is much larger than his, would visit us there. Then he said his pawpaw (grandmas boyfriend) can\u2019t ride in a car because he has a heart condition but he can\u2019t tell me what the condition is and he use to come to our apartment when I lived with my ex. \n\n\nNow he\u2019s demanding I bring him next weekend but I\u2019m already scheduled to work and I really don\u2019t want to anyways for all the reasons above. His mom and grandma are pissed. My ex said his grandma is distraught and crying (when is she not tho) and that his mom bought our son presents and they\u2019re saying I\u2019m a cruel and heartless person.

Have a set plan for holidays, pickups and drop offs, etc. it seems like he\u2019s doing the absolute bare minimum yet expects you to bend over backwards to accommodate him and his family at the drop of a hat.", "At least send it to Mom and Grandma so he cannot lie to them.", "This is too long. Skip the whole beginning part about what you\u2019re not going to do. Just say what their options are. I do love the last 2 sentences with all my heart.", "You should! This is a great NO-Nonsense reply.", "1000%!!!!", "Do copy and paste. Also don\u2019t admit his paternity. Say my child or use los name.", "ABSOLUTELY copy and paste that, EXCEPT \"our child\", say \"My child\" or sons name, and send it immediately. And make sure it is a group text. That way no one can lie or spin the narrative.", "But he does pay support. She said he's paying $200 biweekly. That's pretty generous for him to be paying, knowing he's not on the birth certificate. Honestly, she's pretty lucky that he hasn't taken her to court. But i'm curious to know why she didn't put him on the birth certificate but has no issues taking his money.", "This guy is abusive to you and he'll be abusive to your son. He'll teach your son to do this to women. Drop the rope. Don't lift another finger to keep him in your son's life. His parents and grandparents can make their own arrangements with you if it's important enough to them.", "Honestly, considering he isn't on the birth certificate, I wouldn't let them see my son at all at this point. Every single one of them sounds awful and exhausting.\n\nEdit: NTA", "Jfc! \ud83d\ude44 I'd block all the family members numbers. I'd tell him from now on if he wants to see your child he's coming to you. And the visits will be supervised. \n\nYou said he's giving you approximately a $100 a week. Do you think he'd have to owe you more than that if you were to take him to court for child support? Not really sure if you want to do that. If he's not on the Birth Certificate because then he'd be establishing some sort of paternity. \n\nIf you could do okay financially without his money I'd cut him off completely. He and his family sound like they're more trouble than their worth.", "Knew this was going to be the answer! Sounds like my ex-inlaws. \"He's just stressed, you don't do enough to support him, he didn't mean it, it was an accident. You have to forgive him, don't throw your marriage away because you aren't mature enough to take responsibility for your part in this.\"\n\nWe had a 1yo, I was pregnant, working full time, was responsible for all home/child care duties, had no access to any money (was an abusive marriage obviously), had to put our 1yo in childcare when I was at work, as even when he did manage to work (usually part-time for a few weeks then fired)he refused to watch our child. He was screwing around with 3 women I found out about, and attempted to punch our child (I got in the way). My grandfather and father both passed within months of each other, and I wasn't allowed to cry or grieve. But sure, let's always place the blame on the DIL. \n\nHugs to you and your child. Stick to your boundaries, keep copies of everything, where possible do all communication via sms or email. If they continue to harass you, cut of all contact.", "....Honestly because of that I don't think he has any rights to his kid! If he wants more time with him, let him go to court.", "I have a feeling ive seen on other posts something about having to claim within a year. \nI could be entirely wrong but it might be worth checking whether there\u2019s a cutoff point that he has effectively given up his rights as he\u2019s known about your child (who he assumed to be his, and who you did not keep secret from him) for over a certain time - and in that time not had his name added to the birth certificate nor paid adequate support nor otherwise taken responsibility.", "'My child' every time.", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t personally want to affirm paternity in writing at this point, but otherwise I would totally copy and paste that comment word for word.", "A bit late for that, he is paying child support, not much but still", "Good catch...", "What a stupid statement. If the kid is, in fact, ex\u2019s son, it does not  matter whether she  \u201caffirm(s) his paternity\u201d by using \u201cour child\u201d. She is \u201caffirming his paternity\u201d by receiving child support every month, allowing the father to see the child(as she should, only a shit parent would keep their child away from the other parent {unless there are extenuating circumstances such as active signs of abuse}) and further by taking the kid to see its father\u2019s parents and grandparents. Unless he gives up his parental rights, it matters not one whit whether she \u201caffirms paternity\u201d in writing, is currently on the birth certificate or currently has custody rights, he IS the child\u2019s father and can claim the right to visits and/or partial custody at any time.", "sounds like the explanation is to clarify things for ex's mom and grandmother", "I did it didn\u2019t go super well. So apparently ex had told his mom and grandma that I *was* going to come to his grandparents house next weekend and then suddenly cancelled. She was super rude and condescending about it too and when I told her that I never agreed to come there next weekend she accused me of lying and went on a tangent about how I\u2019m keeping my son from them and I need to take this up with my ex and blah blah", "200 depends on his income. Honestly, my sister was ordered to pay more than that when she was delivering pizzas, so it's likely going to be an underpay to child support \n\nShe's also driving the bulk of the visits, which is another thing a court would put a stop to", "That's what I think. Why bend over backwards for someone who is going to be a negative influence on your child.\n\nLimit contact where possible !!", "Was that about the FMLA the dad wanted to get but would be having nothing to do with the baby and even missed the birth?  I think she said she didn't put him on the bc and wouldn't until the time passed that he could claim his paternal leave.  I am in favor of her level of pettiness.", "Also, do they know why you broke up?\n\nI'd threaten to spill that tea if he doesn't prove he is communicating between all of you 100% honestly. Because, you know he isn't.", "or just state the baby's name", "Not officially,  it sounds like.  It would be a lot more if it was official child support.", "i wouldn't bother. nothing you would do will please them and no good deed goes unpunished.\n\nwhy should you bother?\n\nand if he wants to establish parental rights  even better, then the court will make sure he pays a decent child support.", "go to court. get your official money and custody rights. Make it so he has to come to you for pick up.  Askt for a parenting app so you only go through official channels.\n\nFor now,  don't engage in any name calling or drama.  Be above it all and be the reasonable one especially in writing! Just tell him your budget and time constraints don't allow you to travel right now, but he is more than welcome to come visit. No fighting. Be lovely.  Be strong and say no though.  You don't have a custody agreement. You don't have to take your child anywhere. \n\nPlease go to court.", "\" I did take it up with your son, he then has gone on to lie to you,  he probably should have been raised better\"", "Dude, if your ex has a problem, he needs to go through the courts at this point. Even not on the birth certificate, that's easy to remedy with a DNA test that the court would insist on.\n\nIn case he does, save all communications. Screenshot, print, maybe consider a parenting app going forward for communications\n\nThe reality is he likely is underpaying what child support would be and knows it. Not going to court avoids child support. It also typically outlines things like who is responsible for driving at what times, which it seems like he won't like\n\nHis mother, at this point shouldn't be talking to you at all.", "I am curious, how come he's not on the birth certificate? I'm just wondering because from what you've said + my potentially flawed mental math your son was about 8 months old when you guys split up, is that correct? Was there something else going on at the time of his birth that made one/both of you guys decide to not put his name on it? Sorry to hear you're having to deal with this and his stupid asshole family \u2764\ufe0f", "Tell them to take it up with your ex, and then just ignore everything else they send and move on with your evening.", "You should not have even entertained your ex\u2019s mother or grandma.  Neither are a third parent.  What they want and how they feel doesn\u2019t matter.  By calling them and attempting to explain yourself you feed into their belief that they are owed time with your child and that their wants and expectations have value. Of course she didn\u2019t believe you.  She\u2019s HIS mom.  \n\nMy husband\u2018s area was family law for 19 years.  \n\nThe best advice I can give you is:\n\nTo not take advise from people on the internet.  \n\n Stop communicating with your ex\u2019s family.  \n\nTry to communicate with your ex via text.\n\nReally think long and hard about going to court.  An court order doesn\u2018s just work one way.  Sure he may have to pay you more child support but he could also get more time with your child.", "Exactly. She's getting paid minimum wage to drive her son to this shit father and his relatives.", "That\u2019s only $433/mo, being he could support them when OP wasn\u2019t working and she had to get a job and pay for child care, means he likely earns a lot more than her, $433 is nothing these days.  I\u2019d tell them they are out of luck, he can take her to court but you\u2019ll require he be listed as the father, he will be subject to all limitations requiring his compliance etc and he will pay support commensurate with the income disparity, especially since he has such limited contact which does mean support will be higher and may have to pay for child care too.. Grandma can mail the gifts.  Screw the screwed up family . Honestly if he says he will do it, I\u2019d find the absolute best custody attorney money can buy and take him to the cleaners.", "Here's the thing he's not on the birth certificate, so I have a hard time believing a judge would force him to pay anything without proof that was his child, sounds like he's doing it on his own. I'm just curious to know why she's taking money from someone that she admits has no rights. It's her choice to be driving there. Just like it's his choice to be paying anything. He's not on the birth certificate, all visitation sounds to be on her terms , and she admits that he has no rights, so really he could stop paying at any moment.\n\nI think they're both being children in the situation, and I really feel bad for that baby.", "Might well have been. I too applaud the pettiness in that case!\nIt just made me wonder about the laws in terms of paternity and whether they could be useful for OP in hopefully being able to distance the crazies without risking them using their money to mount legal attacks.", "Lmfao. \u201cMy husband was a lawyer\u2026\u201d.  So you should know all about grandparents rights then.", "A judge would order a paternity test. That's fairly standard. When it comes back as a match, he would legally be considered the father. This is completely on him and normally step one in a relationship split. That he hasn't initiated speaks volumes about him, tbh. He can change the situation and is currently choosing not to\n\nOP could also wise up and force a court case to get a set amount of child support, drop off, and visitation schedule. For him, keeping her away from that probably suits him\n\nFurthermore, she kinda spelled out her finances and sahm situation. Kinda a no brainer why. It sounds like it is his kid and they both know that. \n\nLast point: a good way to get on the birth certificate is to be there when the kid is born.... seems like they were together, so there's some large questions why he wasn't a part of that process. The father is typically involved, if not leading, the birth certificate being filed"]}
