Our relationship became financially abusive after he convinced me to become a STAHM when our son (16 months) was born. When I caught him cheating in march (had been going on since the beginning of my pregnancy) I told him I no longer wanted to be with him and absolutely needed to get a job and start making my own money. I ask if we could remain roommates and I find a job with opposite hours from him, He said no if I didn\u2019t want to be with him then get out. I ask if I could have some time to get back on my feet first, he said no. So I had no choice but to move back and stay with family. Since I moved he sees our son around every 4-6 weeks for a couple of hours and sends $200 a month for him. My ex is not on our son\u2019s birth certificate and has no custody rights.\nUsually when he visits I meet him much closer to his place, although one time we met halfway and he\u2019s met closer to me twice. Ive taken my son to his great grandparents house once since moving. It\u2019s 3+ hours away and traffic was awful in that area like it always is because of construction that\u2019s been going on forever. It was a disaster and his grandma said she was tired and ready for us to leave within two hours.\n\n\nNow the current situation: my ex ask me to bring our son to his grandparents house on Dec 23rd for Christmas. I told him absolutely not, traffic is already horrendous on a normal weekend and I don\u2019t even want to imagine it the Saturday before Christmas, and I don\u2019t want to have to strap my active toddler in a car seat for what would likely be a 4 hour trip where he would cry and scream. The 23rd is also the day of my parents annual party which they knew.\n\n\n I told him if he wanted me to come to his grandparents house it would have to be after Christmas, but I would meet them at my ex\u2019s apartment sometime before Christmas, or they could all come to my parents (at or before the party) on the 23rd. He didn\u2019t like any of those ideas and said he\u2019d just tell his family they don\u2019t get to see our son at Christmas and how messed up it was. He says his apartment is too small for everyone, but I use to live there and my family, which is much larger than his, would visit us there. Then he said his pawpaw (grandmas boyfriend) can\u2019t ride in a car because he has a heart condition but he can\u2019t tell me what the condition is and he use to come to our apartment when I lived with my ex. \n\n\nNow he\u2019s demanding I bring him next weekend but I\u2019m already scheduled to work and I really don\u2019t want to anyways for all the reasons above. His mom and grandma are pissed. My ex said his grandma is distraught and crying (when is she not tho) and that his mom bought our son presents and they\u2019re saying I\u2019m a cruel and heartless person. I felt like I was doing what\u2019s best for my son and they could come here for once but now everyone is saying all these things about me and acting like I\u2019ve committed a crime.", "created_utc": 1701387309, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187wr4x/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_my_toddler_to_his/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Text him, and nosy mom and grandma for good measure, ONCE and say \"I am not confining my small child to a car seat for a 6+ hour round trip car ride in Christmas traffic on a date you are already aware is my family's Christmas party, and I am also not driving 6+ hours next weekend at the last minute when I am already scheduled to work at my job, where I earn the vast, vast majority of funds used to care for my son. You are not being deprived of seeing \\[son\\]. You are welcome to come to my family party on the 23rd or see him before the party, and I have already offered to bring him on that 6+ hour round trip after Christmas, *or* to bring him to \\[ex's\\] apartment before Christmas. Not doing exactly what you want at your convenience to my detriment, and, more importantly, the detriment of *our child,* does not mean I am \"depriving\" you. Those are your options; you are welcome to choose one. If you respond with anything other than the choice of one of the options I am generously offering at the considerable expense of my time, energy, and gas money, I will not respond.

Otherwise he and his family can shut up.", "NTA  \n\n\nSay no, keep saying no, stop with any and all reasoning. You have provided an option and they are doing no compromising.   \n\n\nDragging a toddler that far out and back is insane. Both you and the child will be wrecks. They can come to you, none of their BS whiney excuses.  \n\n\nTime to block all of them on social media and your phone. Silence is golden.", "NTA\n\nIf he's not on the birth certificate, he has no custody rights, and he doesn't pay an appropriate amount of child support, then he has no right to expect anything. \n\nIf his family contacts you to complain, tell them that he hasn't acted like a parent, so he can't expect you to inconvenience yourself and your child because he wants to pretend he's a daddy for his parents and grandparents.", "NTA \n\nStop this right now. It is his responsibility to make the effort to see his son. It is not your responsibility to drive all over the place to make your ex bf's life easier. If he wants regular visitation, he can go to court. He won't do that though, because he is not paying enough support and knows it. You need to stop letting him control you. You don't have to do what he says.", "NTA \n\nIf he wants visitation he needs to go to court with you and work out an actual child support plan and custody decision. \n\nTill then, he can stick it with the demands.", "\rAbsolutely NTA.\r  \n\r  \nIt sounds like you really have tried to be accommodating. You and your little one enjoy the holidays with your family!", "NTA at all. Do you have any way of contacting the ex's family without involving the ex? I'm doubting he told them the options, and they may be more accommodating than the ex is. He doesn't want to put in any effort, so it's really easy to make you the bad guy. You are in NO way obligated to spend any time with his family for xmas - for whatever reason.", "NTA. not on the birth certificate and no custody agreement? He's lucky you even allow him to visit.", "Start keeping receipts for expenses, or at least copies. The texts too, everything, you will probably need this one day, if there is a custody or support issue, even a tax issue if he has the kid social security number. And if he stops showing up, the kid will want to know. Most will anyway one day when they\u2019re older.", "NTA.\n\nThis dude: cheated on you when you were pregnant with his child; isn\u2019t on his child\u2019s birth certificate; kicked you and your infant son out immediately when his continued cheating was exposed; can\u2019t be bothered to find the time to visit his son more than once a month; pays less than $2500/year in child support; likely other things that didn\u2019t make the cut. You don\u2019t owe him your time, your energy, not even your inconvenience. He\u2019s the asshole, he\u2019s always been the asshole. These are the consequences of the horrendously irresponsible choices he made, *continued to make,* **and continues to make.** If his mother and grandparents want to blame somebody for not getting to see their grandson/great-grandson, then they should have a word with their son/grandson. Also, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they already do blame him; he\u2019s just telling you that they blame you so you\u2019ll feel guilty. If they do blame you, then they\u2019re assholes too.\n\nLook, I think you are doing way too much to include this man in your son\u2019s life. I understand that you want your son to have a father in his life, but this guy isn\u2019t a father. He\u2019s a deadbeat in the fullest sense. He is toxic masculinity personified. **Your son will be better off if he never has the chance to learn what it means to be a man from your ex.** You shouldn\u2019t put any effort into making it easier for him to make you and your son\u2019s life any harder than he already has. Take him to court and get real child support and then negotiate his visitation (as in he can come visit; not have his son delivered). Children are better off with fathers; they are likewise better off without deadbeats.", "INFO\n\n> he convinced me to become a STAHM\n\n... what does the T stand for?\n\nStay *temporarily* at home mom?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
