I realize that she likely had extremely limited options, but that would have been a reason to make sure she was making this as easy as possible for you, so it could run as long as possible.

At all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off, from an insurance perspective, if you let anyone borrow your car twice or more in a month, they have to be listed as a driver on your policy since they have \"regular access.\"  Considering she's already totaled *her* car, and damaged yours, I'd say it's safe to assume she has a poor driving record.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason this is so important:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If she wrecks your car, and you file a claim and it comes out that she's regularly driving your car?

You can even explain that to her like it's not your fault.  \"Hey, it's not that you're a bad driver, but if someone runs a red light and wrecks my car, my insurance may not cover it since you're regularly driving it.  I can't risk losing my car.\"  She's already damaged it as it is and that's a whole other issue.

Literally, anyone can borrow your car and it's covered.  And if your neighbor borrowed it once and got into a wreck, you'd be fine.  Claims opens an investigation and talks to you and asks \"why was your neighbor borrowing your car?\" You'd say \"her car wouldn't start and needed to use it.\" That's fine, they'd cover you.  If you said \"her car was totaled and she uses it all the time.\" That's a huge no-no.  They would deny the claim because they would say she's using it *enough* that she should be listed as a driver so you're rated properly.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that makes sense.", "You could, but I didn't mention it because that would be *his* decision to do that.  And it'd be a dollar amount that he'd have to come up with.
