I realize that she likely had extremely limited options, but that would have been a reason to make sure she was making this as easy as possible for you, so it could run as long as possible.

You can even explain that to her like it's not your fault.  \"Hey, it's not that you're a bad driver, but if someone runs a red light and wrecks my car, my insurance may not cover it since you're regularly driving it.  I can't risk losing my car.\"  She's already damaged it as it is and that's a whole other issue.

If you said \"her car was totaled and she uses it all the time.\" That's a huge no-no.

She would have to pay him *something*.  And I'm sure that alone would be an exorbitantly high rate.  But in that case, he can at least say \"hey I didn't make up that number.  That's why my insurance is going to charge me.\"", "It's possible but that's why it's a red flag, as in warning that something is already wrong with her driving. Hence the dent in his car when she drove it.", "I was thinking previous gas usage & whatever op's time/cost to clean whatever messes she's left, etc.", "Oh yeah, that's all totally reasonable.  I'm just saying, that's \"grounds\" (I'm using that term very lightly) for her to argue with him.  \"Well you didn't charge me before, why now?\" or \"why are you charging me so much?\" or \"oh so if I clean the car, you won't charge me?\" etc. etc.  Again, OP would be totally reasonable in doing this, cars are expensive pieces of property, even if it's a 1995 Camry, it's still worth something to OP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm just saying, any amount of money that OP would come up with could be thrown back at him because he doesn't *HAVE* to charge her anything.  But if his insurance is charging him, he kinda doesn't have a choice.  I mean, he technically doesn't have to charge her extra, but OP saying \"Hey look my insurance is charging me $150 a month to let you drive, so you need to pay me that,\" is incredibly reasonable and if she argued with *that*, she's out of her mind.", "Oh, she'd still argue."]}
