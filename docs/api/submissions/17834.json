I realize that she likely had extremely limited options, but that would have been a reason to make sure she was making this as easy as possible for you, so it could run as long as possible.

At all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off, from an insurance perspective, if you let anyone borrow your car twice or more in a month, they have to be listed as a driver on your policy since they have \"regular access.\"  Considering she's already totaled *her* car, and damaged yours, I'd say it's safe to assume she has a poor driving record.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason this is so important:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If she wrecks your car, and you file a claim and it comes out that she's regularly driving your car?

You can even explain that to her like it's not your fault.  \"Hey, it's not that you're a bad driver, but if someone runs a red light and wrecks my car, my insurance may not cover it since you're regularly driving it.  I can't risk losing my car.\"  She's already damaged it as it is and that's a whole other issue.

Literally, anyone can borrow your car and it's covered.  And if your neighbor borrowed it once and got into a wreck, you'd be fine.  Claims opens an investigation and talks to you and asks \"why was your neighbor borrowing your car?\" You'd say \"her car wouldn't start and needed to use it.\" That's fine, they'd cover you.  If you said \"her car was totaled and she uses it all the time.\" That's a huge no-no.  They would deny the claim because they would say she's using it *enough* that she should be listed as a driver so you're rated properly.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that makes sense.", "You could, but I didn't mention it because that would be *his* decision to do that.  And it'd be a dollar amount that he'd have to come up with.

The entitlement of people is unreal!", "NTA- Since the neighbours are sooooo concerned, they're obviously very eager to lend their cars to her. So let them have at it.\n\nShe took advantage of your generosity. She abused your vehicle and was greedy on top of that. Who borrows a car then doesn't put fuel in it and leaves garbage in it?\n\nNext time you speak to the neighbours, you just say, \"Oh fair play to you for volunteering your car, but you may want to tell Car-en that she's obligated to keep your car clean and fuel it\" then just walk away whistling.", "This man never watched Friday.\n\nYou let her borrow your car? What kind of shit is that?", "NTA. If the neighbours feel that you are too harsh on her they can offer their cars to her.", "Oh my god you\u2019re so NTA!! She had the nerve to be upset with you because she has become reliant on you? I\u2019m sorry for her troubles but she sounds very entitled", "NTA. You're not running a charity service or something. You don't have to lend your car to anyone for any reason just because you work from home. Do not listen to your neighbours. If they are so concerned about that woman, why don't they pool money and buy a car for her? Or why can't they lend their own cars? \nYou need to speak up for yourself more than you actually did. Tell them what you have done and how she has misused your generosity.

For now, I believe the best course of action is to stick to my decision to stop lending my car. Thank you once again for your advice.\n\nStop lending your car and not just \"for now\"", "They didn\u2019t even deserve the reply you gave. I have a 12 and an 8 year old\u2026I got your comment 100%.", "NTA and let your neighbour know the other neighbours are volunteering their help", "Yup, NTA.\n\nI once worked at a bakery and was the only one of 4 staff members with a car. A car I had gotten finance for and was paying the monthly installments for...\n\nAnyways, boss notices I have my own transport, so asks if I can pick up coworker for our 2am shift. Not such a big deal, nor out of my way by too much, so I agree. But now I have to wake up 15 mins earlier to make the pickup. Next thing a new guy starts at the bakery, and so boss asks me to get the new guy too, because \"he lives in my area\" ... So I had to leave home at 1:30am to make 2 pickups, because \"you have a car and they don't\".\n\nI did both pickups 1 time, and then told boss I'm not doing it anymore. I was given major attitude and treated like I was entitled and selfish because now he had to arrange taxi's for his staff. Quit the bakery by the end of that month - boss was toxic.", "NTA what is it with people that think your an AH when others want to use your property. Let them step up and she can use their cars.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe anybody your property. Especially if they mistreat it.", "This. My parents drilled this into my head from the age of 16, you do not let someone else drive your car, except in an emergency or something. What if she totaled OPs car too, and wasn\u2019t covered by the insurance?  Definitely NTA.", "Obviously you know nothing about insurance. Family or non family it doesn\u2019t matter.", "Thanks.
