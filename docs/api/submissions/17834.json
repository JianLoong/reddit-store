I realize that she likely had extremely limited options, but that would have been a reason to make sure she was making this as easy as possible for you, so it could run as long as possible. Was the dent satisfactorily and apologetically explained or might there be a potential hit and run waiting to be discovered?\n\nNTA to make sure you can use your own car and not have to worry about what is happening when she was using it.", "Yeah, wait until she has an accident and YOU GET SUED AND YOUR INSURANCE DENIES YOUR COVERAGE BECAUSE SHE IS NOT AN APPROVED DRIVER, AND THEN SHE SUES YOU FOR HER OWN DAMAGES.\n\nNTA.", "NTA \"stating that she had grown reliant on my assistance\" can anyone direct me to where thats OP's problem? Youve already gone above and beyond letting her borrow it so much, and she just direspected you for the exact reasons you mentioned.", "NTA. And tell your neighbors that it is their turn.", "NTA. You are being taken advantage of. \n\nIf my neighbors were kind enough to let me use their car, I would feel responsible to at least offer gas money or bring it back with a full tank and return it clean. And if I knew it was dented while I was driving, to go to them immediately and let them know (if it were something like a shopping cart dent) and offer to file a claim with my insurance if it were substantial.", "NTA.  At all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off, from an insurance perspective, if you let anyone borrow your car twice or more in a month, they have to be listed as a driver on your policy since they have \"regular access.\"  Considering she's already totaled *her* car, and damaged yours, I'd say it's safe to assume she has a poor driving record.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason this is so important:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If she wrecks your car, and you file a claim and it comes out that she's regularly driving your car? You may have that claim denied.  It could even be a situation where it's not her fault.  And even if insurance doesn't deny the claim, the accident will likely stay on your record for 3 years making your insurance more expensive.  This puts you at incredibly high risk.  You should stop letting this person borrow your car immediately.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't even about you being \"TA\" (you're not), this is about protecting your property.  If you want to make this legal, you could tell her you'll *have* to add her to your insurance policy to avoid a claim being denied and then when, I can only assume, your rate skyrockets, you can tell her she needs to pay the difference.  \"well adding you is going to cost me an extra $150 a month so you have to pay me that.\"  Again, this isn't being harsh, this is protecting you in the event that your car is involved in an accident.  You can even explain that to her like it's not your fault.  \"Hey, it's not that you're a bad driver, but if someone runs a red light and wrecks my car, my insurance may not cover it since you're regularly driving it.  I can't risk losing my car.\"  She's already damaged it as it is and that's a whole other issue.   Also, from the sound of it, she sounds incredibly irresponsible and selfish, so the odds of her having another accident is **HIGH**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLegal stuff aside, NTA.  This person has clearly taken advantage of your kindness.  I understand times are tough, but if she's dented your car and left trash in it, clearly she doesn't respect your kindness.  Even if you want to say, \"well some people aren't aware of how messy they are,\" she's not even putting gas in your car.  This is mind bogglingly disrespectful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to let her continue borrowing your car (you shouldn't), you need to explain all this to her and tell her she needs to pay the difference in insurance by adding her and she needs to put however much gas she uses back into the car when she's done.", "Nta she has had more than enough of your good will. It's time for her to be self sufficient again.", "NTA. You were kind and she took advantage of it. She even said, \"She had grown reliant on my assistance\". That pretty much says it all.", "NTA at all. She needs transportation. That is not your problem.\n\nTell the neighbors to lend her their cars, maybe in turn. You've done your part--more than!", "The neighbours who seemed concerned... gather the neighbours and ask them if they want to contribute to get her a car of her own.", "NTA. I can't imagine letting any of my neighbors use my car because they'd take advantage of it.", "NTA she\u2019s taking advantage of you", "NTA, and you are taking a serious risk letting her borrow it so often if she's not listed as a frequent driver on your insurance. She has no right to expect to use your car and even less so if she can't be bothered to take care of.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
