You just told her true facts. She's abused your trust and you have every right to be angry about that.\n\nIf she's fallen on hard times, she shouldn't be eating restaurant food for lunch. She just wants freebies. After being taken advantage of before, you're entitled to call her out on it.", "NTA she got called out by you and she can't accept the facts and she's probably embarrassed but that's on her not you.", "She's most definitely taking advantage of people's goodwill.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, I worked with someone who was like that, and they had a drug problem. People stopped lending them money, but we didn't do a group lunch thing like you do.\n\nNow, people do have struggles that we don't know anything about. Sometimes, it's caring for a family member or helping out a friend, and that could be a reason why she's short on money ... but that's not an excuse! She should be aware that she doesn't pay people back and should feel bad about it.", "NTA. Very unprofessional for her to beg for money constantly. Could you have said it nicer? Yeah. \n\nMaybe apologize for not talking about that privately and explain nicely about the reputation she is getting from other coworkers. \n\nWhen you walk away, wish her well and dare I say it\u2026 BYE FELICIA. \n\nThank you.", "NTA \n\n>\tWord has gotten around that I\u2019m a bitch and insensitive.\n\nYou\u2019re my kind of bitch!", "NTA.

That adds up. And like you said, you\u2019re all coworkers - you\u2019re all in the same boat.  She is basically lying to everyone with \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back, or I\u2019ll get you next time\u201d, knowing full well she has no intention on doing so.  Also, ordering lunch is a luxury. Not a necessity. She needs to bring a lunch and only eat what she brings. \n\nHer friends giving you the side eye about it probably don\u2019t know she isn\u2019t paying anyone back, or that she hasn\u2019t asked for someone to give her the money/lunches.  If these friends of hers are at work, and they or her start harassing you at work.  Go back to HR. Although she hasn\u2019t technically broken any company policies with \u201cborrowing\u201d money, she (or her friends) would be if they harass you over the situation.  \n\nAnd btw, she\u2019s lucky you guys aren\u2019t petty with a lot of time on your hands.  You can totally take someone to small claims court over a minuscule amount of money.", "NTA but you should also keep in mind that your employer could be paying her less than you realize.

If Felicia is that tight on money then she has no place asking for any knowing she'll never give it back. She needs to pack a lunch as I and others like me have done many times.

But you didn't need to go further than that, however true it may be and however frustrated you were by her constant demands. You've just made for an uncomfortable workplace now.

She is a mooch who tries to get away with not repaying loans and you went in way too hot on the issue in front of other people.", "Moochers don\u2019t like being called out.

She's not breaking any policies.", "NTA let me get this straight she takes money knowing she\u2019s not going to pay back you tell the truth but you\u2019re the insensitive b? She doesn\u2019t NEED takeout lunch.", "NTA.  In high school I often needed money for lunch. One person who I only knew from home room always had extra if I needed it.  I always paid her back as soon as I had babysitting money.  By 11th grade I had a job and very seldom needed to borrow.  But even in 8th and 9th grade I had enough pride to pay her back.", "ESH. \n\nYou don't know Felicia's situation - maybe she's caring for disabled parents or something. You don't need to shame her.", "NTA -  You told her the truth.", "NTA", "NTA. I keep cash in my wallet for just these situations. We also don\u2019t make much, so only do this a couple of times per month. This is the situation that should exist between coworkers buying lunch. Since that\u2019s not the way she behaves she shouldn\u2019t be included.", "I just realized I didn\u2019t really answer your question.

You can't say let me borrow some money and I'll pay it back and not pay it back. That's stealing. And takeout isn't a necessity, it's a luxury. If money is tight you pack your lunch, you don't steal from your coworkers, who live in the same area, have similar salary and possibly similar situation as you. I've lived with very little money, doing an unpaid internship and working extra on the weekends and I packed my lunch from home, didn't scam my colleagues for takeout.\n\nIt's one thing to ask a work friend (not acquaintance), if you feel comfortable doing it, \"Hey money is really tight, could you spare a 20 so I can get some groceries?\" and another to say \"Hey you're getting sushi?

She should have those so-called \u201cfriends\u201d give her money for lunches then", "Hi there - HR manager with a decade and a half of experience: that\u2019s actually not true. Go back to HR and let them know that it\u2019s creating a hostile work environment. They can\u2019t do anything about the lunch ordering since it\u2019s not on the company\u2019s dime, but them making you uncomfortable for telling her you won\u2019t lend her money and basically harassing you - if it\u2019s bugging you and clear they\u2019re doing it - is a def hostile/toxic entombment."]}
