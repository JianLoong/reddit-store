We hosted a home party for Rob's family. Ordered Pizza as I couldn\u2019t cook huge quantities being pregnant. I met Rob\u2019s cousin for the first time, Deb. Rob doesn't keep in touch with her but invited her on insistence from his parents out of courtesy. Deb kept commenting unnecessarily rude things at me. Eg: \"I didn't expect you'd keep a clean house\", I thought she hinted at my pregnancy and I ignored it. Later she said \"You're Indian, right, so how come you guys waited 4 years to have a kid? Aren't you all big on population explosion?\" then started laughing and said \"Hope I didn't offend you\". I explained her politely India is not like that and it was a personal decision. After a while Deb came around and said \"Hey you don't have any fake accent, which is great coz I'm able to understand you. Haha. Hope I didn't offend you\". I started to think this is beyond mean behaviour but I kept cool. Finally, she said - \"You must be dying out here without your Indian curry which leaves the house stinking for days\". She seemed amused & this point I thought it\u2019s enough, I simply told her to check with my British Husband as he's the one making the Indian curry since a few years and our house never stinks. She sheepishly added \"Hope I didn't offend you\" and I calmly replied - \"Your misinformed opinion is not important enough to offend me, Deb\".\n\nAlmost everyone who were around us burst into laughter including my husband. She felt embarrassed and left shortly. Although proud with the way I handled Deb, Rob later apologised and told me that was why he never kept in touch with her. I was alright though. I didn\u2019t think of it much as I thought I was still polite enough to Deb. A week later, Rob told me that Deb had bad mouthed about me to everyone. Some of his family members are blaming him for not standing up for Deb and that he invited her and let her be insulted. Some took my side and said its Deb's fault. She even lied about getting her stomach upset from the Indian food that I cooked that day. The ones who were at home know we ordered Pizza. Rob is the one getting to hear all this as no one came to me. Rob is getting calls from relatives he didn't even know existed. He says he doesn't care and it gives him more reason to not see Deb again and is OK with going NC with anyone who support Deb. Should I take initiative and try to clear the situation?
