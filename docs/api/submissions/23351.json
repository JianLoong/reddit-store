My wife is Somali/African American. My sister would call her a \"spoiled rotten woman\" anytime she'd come over however my sister stopped after a private conversation with my wife. My sister thought this because my wife talked about how growing up she would get gold on her birthday from family members. My wife has a jewelry collection that has grown over the years. My wife is by no means a rotten woman. She's extremely charming and besides my sister I've never heard of anyone that dislikes her. \n\nSo about a week ago was my nieces 2nd birthday and my sister invited my family. My wife and my sister were talking in separate groups. At one point someone from my sisters group complimented my wife's dress and my sister somehow took that as them complementing her weight and said \" well we can't all maintain a size small, some of us would rather take care of our children.\" Everyone was not only stunned but very confused. My wife changed the subject and they continued to talk until it was time for cake and gifts. It was going very well,  the kids were eating and my niece was loving her presents but then it was our turn to give our gifts. She and I picked out a bracelet from the jewelry collection to give her with a card that said \"dahab from one gold girl to another\". My wife also picked out a watch and a pair of earrings for my sister. How my wife could be so generous to a woman that IMO doesn't deserve it I will never know. When my sister and her husband opened the gifts the only one not smiling was my sister. My sister said \"do I look like I need your hand outs?\" awkward silence. My wife tried to explain that she wanted to get my niece something nice but it seemed like everything my wife said just made her more angry. My sister began getting louder with my wife saying \" what do you think I'm too poor to give my daughter a nice gift?\". I don't even raise my voice at my wife and I'd be damned if anyone else did so I told her to take our daughter and wait in the car. My sister then turned her anger on me. I tried to explain there were no taking sides but my sister then said \"that b*tch is trying to make me look bad in front of my husband and friends in MY home\" that was the the straw that broke the camel's back. I told my sister that her insecurities were not my wife's problem and that the one sided rivalry she had with her needed to stop. I then told her husband we would not come back until my sister fixed what ever hatred she had for my wife. Like I said it's been a week and all we've gotten is empty excuses. While I will admit I could have talked to my sister in private she CHOSE to invite my wife and I just like she CHOSE to yell at my wife in front of everyone. My mom thinks I was too harsh with my sister while my dad applauds me for standing up for my wife. I would really like other people's view on this.

Giving gold/jewelry to girls and women in some cultures is tradition to build their safety net.  It\u2019s really not a flex or bragging though I have had friends who reacted like that when I showed a gift I was given because that kind of jewelry seems not to be as common in some western cultures, especially for younger women. It originated as a security for a woman when things go wrong. My aunt\u2019s maid in India saved for years to give her daughter two gold bangles, for example, so she would have something in case her marriage went badly. \n\nIt is also a sign of love to gift your own jewelry to other women in the family. When my mom got married, her aunts all gave her a piece of their jewelry collection, her future sister in law did too to welcome her. I have set aside gold items for my niece (just a baby now so I\u2019ll wait until she is older), but she already has gold items from my parents. \n\nYour wife was showing her love and sharing her culture and your sister can\u2019t seem to see past her own hatred and bitterness.", "NTA\n\nOP, is it possible that your sister is racist?

Your sister chose the setting, not you or your wife, so no sympathy for her embarrassment.

I spoke to her to be sure she was OK with my husband and I gifting their baby with a gold bracelet and she was so touched that we took the time to find out a cultural gift and her being so far from home and her parents not being there. I think it meant way more to my SIL than to my nibbling. Anytime you are far from home it is comforting to have culture to feel at peace. They have since had 2 more kids and we got them 2 more gold bracelets. Plus we gave cash the moment we met each kid. Its her culture and it makes her feel closer to us all to be able to share in it.

That\u2019s over 21,000 tons of gold !", "Your English spelling is no worse than most native speakers spelling and thanks for the insight.", "[deleted]", "Yeah I was getting that the whole gold jewelry gifts is a culture thing and honestly it was very sweet of his wife to give to them something that she does in her family and finds important. It's her way of telling them that she considers them family, absolutely. And his sister took a victim approach to it. Yikes. \ud83e\udd7a \n\nI'd be so touched if someone did that and considered me family enough to include me.", "Me too", "Agree", "How did you come to that conclusion? Genuine question, as her being white and his wife being Somali doesn't mean it has to be race-related (coming from an Asian person)", "Oh Yeah, you see the Somali/African woman is not to have anything of value, only the \"white\" woman should in SIL's mind.  SIL has deep issues on race/body image/classism.", "I am not religious, but this reminded me of that love language book. To me, sounds like sister and mom want the gifts and are envious that another woman is getting them. My MIL was like that and upset when partner stopped buying them expensive gifts. Now, if I don\u2019t buy it, they get nothing at all.", "If her reason for being angry is rooted in the neighbor\u2019s race, then yes. Black people can be racist too.", "My inference, from the general level of idiocy and hate in her behavior.", "Husband of the year here! NTA", "NTA.  Your sister is SO jealous of your wife she cannot see straight.  She needs to get over it or it appears that she will lose access to a very loving part of the family. \n\nI am sorry you are going through this.  Your wife sounds wonderful", "INFO: Why mention everyone's race? From the post it sounds more like your sister is jealous of your wife's wealth. Has there been a racial component in the past?", "It sounds like your sister has a mental/personality disorder. She needs therapy. Always stick up for your beautiful wife and tell your sister to back down or you\u2019ll have to implement some serious boundaries. You are definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou continue standing up for your wife. Your sister's issues are her own problem and until a sincere apology comes then they can stay her problem", "Your father and you deserve kudos for the defense of your wife.\n\nYour wife was the one who said the harsh words in front of everyone.\n\nShe is the one who needs to apologize.  It doesn't surprise me that your mother is supporting her daughter\n\nNTA", "Sounds like she was just looking for a fight from the second you got in the door. NTA", "NTA. Your sister is being very angry, jealous, and antagonist towards your wife for seemingly no reason. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s your nieces birthday, doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s your sisters house. She has zero right to blow up at your wife (who again did absolutely NOTHING wrong in any way shape or form) and expect for you to not say anything. She\u2019s wrong, you\u2019re not", "Apparently the trashy sister never heard of heirlooms.", "You're a good man and an even better husband, your sister is a lunatic.\n\n\nWhy did it take you this long to shut this down though? Sounds like your sister is always alot towards your wife. NTA", "NTA you handled the situation so well. You stood for your wife which is a husbands job and you stood up to your sister for having an issue with your wife for no reason.", "There has to be a racial element to this because your sister holds a different kind of rage towards your wife and it's not normal.", "Nta. Your sister is a special kind of ah though.  Your wife sounds like a lovely and kind woman, and glad you and your dad are supporting her. What an unnecessary drama.", "NTA - You stood up for your wife. Sure, you could have spoke with your sister privately, but when she decided to call your wife a \u201cb*tch\u201d and make a scene in front of everyone else, she made it a public conversation. Your sister needs to work on herself. And probably needs to find a therapist to talk to honestly. Stay low/no contact with your sister until she gets her shit together and genuinely can apologize to your wife for her behavior.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA. Your sister is a horrible, jealous person. Tell her the truth and cut her out. Your wife deserves better than to be on the receiving end of that vile behaviour.", "You did well.  Stick to your guns.", "THIS is the content I am here to read!!! Yes! Good on you for standing up for your wife. Is your sister just racist? What\u2019s her deal? NTA! And good for your dad too for also sticking up for you!", "Nope. Your sister has issues.", "NTA -  Not even . . . Your wife sounds like a lovely, gracious and good hearted person. Something is wrong with your sister . . .  normal people . .people with manners always say thank you for the gift . . .  Your sister is not normal and she has extremely bad manners.

Life is hard.  Staying positive is hard work.  Keeping someone around who will be a bad influence, and a bad example, will make it exponentially harder.\n\nYour sister is jealous, but doesn't want to do the hard work.  Unless she has a medical condition, her weight is her responsibility, and shouldn't be taken out on anyone else.  Her attitude and insecurities need work, but I'm betting she can't see that.  A lot of us work hard at life, jobs, keeping our health & attitudes in good shape, so we can be there for our families. (Then again, getting up an hour early to work out before breakfast & getting the family going is the only peace some people get - Glorious!)\n\nYou & your wife sound like an awesome team!", "At least the watch and earrings. No need to punish niece for the sins of her mother.", "First concern before even finishing.", "That was my first thought too.", "I\u2019m a black woman, you wouldn\u2019t believe how often I and other black women get treated like this by non-black women", "That's why I specified the sister's gifts.", "I met Iman in the 80's. Beyond gorgeous, and so nice.", ">There is a Lot of anti-Black racism in Asian American communities, in my and others experience.\n\nSister is white, not Asian.

I knew that jewelry and jewelry chests were important but I had no idea that they had such a high percentage of the world\u2019s gold!\n\nThere was also an exchange in their sub the other day by a woman who had been given a gold ring from her grandma.

She is most likely good looking! hence the comment about her body when they were talking about the dress. But i have no clue, i have just seen a lot of women be that way about each other. - maybe it is both race and she is hot plus it most likely boils her blood that despite it all she is so lovely to her haha", "Everyone likes to jump to these conclusions, especially on reddit. I wouldn't assume race had anything to do with it and I doubt anyone else would if the original post didn't include them. \n\nSounds to me like she's just jealous that there's someone who isn't only better looking than her, but also who seemingly has a better life economically speaking. Throw in a possible sibling rivalry with her brother and it's all easily explained. I think all of those things are more common than people just being racist."]}
