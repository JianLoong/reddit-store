{"id": 23351, "submission_id": "15c3jzr", "title": "AITA for telling my sister her insecurities aren't my wife's problem", "selftext": "I (M36) and my sister (F29) have been civil despite us being half siblings( I'm Asian and she's white). My wife is Somali/African American. My sister would call her a \"spoiled rotten woman\" anytime she'd come over however my sister stopped after a private conversation with my wife. My sister thought this because my wife talked about how growing up she would get gold on her birthday from family members. My wife has a jewelry collection that has grown over the years. My wife is by no means a rotten woman. She's extremely charming and besides my sister I've never heard of anyone that dislikes her. \n\nSo about a week ago was my nieces 2nd birthday and my sister invited my family. My wife and my sister were talking in separate groups. At one point someone from my sisters group complimented my wife's dress and my sister somehow took that as them complementing her weight and said \" well we can't all maintain a size small, some of us would rather take care of our children.\" Everyone was not only stunned but very confused. My wife changed the subject and they continued to talk until it was time for cake and gifts. It was going very well,  the kids were eating and my niece was loving her presents but then it was our turn to give our gifts. She and I picked out a bracelet from the jewelry collection to give her with a card that said \"dahab from one gold girl to another\". My wife also picked out a watch and a pair of earrings for my sister. How my wife could be so generous to a woman that IMO doesn't deserve it I will never know. When my sister and her husband opened the gifts the only one not smiling was my sister. My sister said \"do I look like I need your hand outs?\" awkward silence. My wife tried to explain that she wanted to get my niece something nice but it seemed like everything my wife said just made her more angry. My sister began getting louder with my wife saying \" what do you think I'm too poor to give my daughter a nice gift?\". I don't even raise my voice at my wife and I'd be damned if anyone else did so I told her to take our daughter and wait in the car. My sister then turned her anger on me. I tried to explain there were no taking sides but my sister then said \"that b*tch is trying to make me look bad in front of my husband and friends in MY home\" that was the the straw that broke the camel's back. I told my sister that her insecurities were not my wife's problem and that the one sided rivalry she had with her needed to stop. I then told her husband we would not come back until my sister fixed what ever hatred she had for my wife. Like I said it's been a week and all we've gotten is empty excuses. While I will admit I could have talked to my sister in private she CHOSE to invite my wife and I just like she CHOSE to yell at my wife in front of everyone. My mom thinks I was too harsh with my sister while my dad applauds me for standing up for my wife. I would really like other people's view on this.

Good on you for standing up for your wife.", "NTA Well your sister is a jerk and I also think this is a major cultural misunderstanding from her. Giving gold/jewelry to girls and women in some cultures is tradition to build their safety net.  It\u2019s really not a flex or bragging though I have had friends who reacted like that when I showed a gift I was given because that kind of jewelry seems not to be as common in some western cultures, especially for younger women. It originated as a security for a woman when things go wrong. My aunt\u2019s maid in India saved for years to give her daughter two gold bangles, for example, so she would have something in case her marriage went badly. \n\nIt is also a sign of love to gift your own jewelry to other women in the family. When my mom got married, her aunts all gave her a piece of their jewelry collection, her future sister in law did too to welcome her. I have set aside gold items for my niece (just a baby now so I\u2019ll wait until she is older), but she already has gold items from my parents. \n\nYour wife was showing her love and sharing her culture and your sister can\u2019t seem to see past her own hatred and bitterness.", "NTA\n\nOP, is it possible that your sister is racist? Because it seems she thinks that your wife should be inferior to her. Poorer than her, uglier, dumber, less popular... just like some very racist stereotype of African American.", "**NTA** OP, your sister is the absolute worst and is projecting her own insecurities about her quality as a person/mother/wife on your wife. \n\nYou're right to drop contact until she drops the attitude.", "You are a rockstar of a husband. And your sister truly needs some therapy. NTA.", "NTA, your sister obviously is very jealous of your wife, but that's not your wife's problem. Go no contact until your sister learns to grow up and become an adult.", "Are you serious? Of course NTA. Heads up for you standing up to your wife. She *is* too generous and you\u2019re really lucky. You\u2019re totally right that your sister is just projecting and this is none of your or your wife\u2019s fault. She needs therapy.", "NTA is your sister\u2019s attitude to your wife racist? Anyway, I would go LC from now on", "NTA. What you said was perfect. Good for you for standing up for your wife.", "NTA - You tried to be civil and be there for your niece when your sister made a public spectacle of herself. You responded heatedly, sure and yes you could have spoken to her in private but the result of how your sister looks would have been about the same. It is a no win situation at this point.   \nGood luck with it all.", "NTA and good for you for standing up for your wife right then and there.  Your sister chose the setting, not you or your wife, so no sympathy for her embarrassment. Don't know what is causing your sister's extreme jealousy, but it is something she personally needs to deal with -- no one else can fix her dark heart but her.  Your mom's defending her indefensible behavior at all is perhaps part of the problem.  So sorry this is happening but hope you will stand your ground and not in any way condone such hateful behavior.  Your wife sounds like a jewel.", "NTA For whatever reason, your sister doesn't like your wife and has no problem making it glaringly obvious. Your sister put your wife on blast in front if her guests. What were you supposed to do, thank her for the invitation and lovely time then leave? You extended your sister the same courtesy she extended your wife. I think until your sister sorts out her \"issues\", it's healthier for your family to limit contact with her until she's prepared to behave civilly towards your wife.", "NTA - your sister made her issues public and it\u2019s not for you to fix that. I feel badly for you wife having to deal with that.", "Your wife sounds lovely. I wish she was my SIL, lol. You did great sticking up for her, but it might be time to go low to no contact with your toxic sister. NTA", "Your sister is the AH and your mom is the enabler.  No, you were not too harsh with your sister, you weren't harsh enough. Standing up for your wife will never make you the AH.", "NTA. \n\nYou are surely aware your sister would find any excuse to bother or create a fight with you wife: imagine what would have happen if your gift was not a bracelet but a toy. Your sister might complain about her daughter not receiving gold in her birthday. \n\nI agree, this is one-sided hate and it needs to stops. Sister is looking for every chance to create trouble and humiliate your wife. Also, her complaint about the gift was not voiced in a private setting either, so the more you mess around...", "Nta. I think you handled it perfectly.", "NTA.\n\nYou stood up for your wife.\n\nSimple as that.\n\nAnd I wholly agree with your father.", "YTA. You know your sister hates your wife but still continue to take your wife to these parties where she is verbally abused. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first instance and I doubt it will be the last confrontation even if she apologize. You sister is rotten to the core and you need to throw her out of your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
