{"id": 7212, "submission_id": "10apsuw", "title": "AITA for accusing my SIL and brother of wanting to isolate my nephew?", "selftext": "My brother is Vinn and he's married to my SIL, Samantha. Vinn's son is Hayden and he's 11 and Samantha's daughter is Aria and she's 5. When Hayden was 7 and Aria was 2 Vinn and Samantha got married. Hayden's mom died when he was a baby and Aria's dad does not appear to have ever been in her life. So around five months ago Vinn came and asked me if I could spend some time talking to Hayden and figure out why he seems so indifferent toward Aria. He said he and Samantha were concerned because Hayden didn't really pay any attention to her and a lot of people believed Hayden was an only child, which they felt must have come from Hayden.\n\nI spoke to Hayden some. He was pretty talkative about it actually. He told me he really didn't care much for Aria and that she wasn't his sister and he didn't want her to be. I asked if there was any reason and he said he just didn't. That Samantha isn't his mom and his dad isn't Aria's dad, so they weren't brother and sister. He also said he never really wanted his dad and Samantha to get married and so he tried not to say much because he didn't want his dad to be angry with him. I helped him talk to Vinn about what he told me. Once my involvement was more or less done Samantha was informed by Vinn. Hayden called and told me he hoped everything would be okay. I tried to assure him that it would be.\n\nA few weeks after I had spoken to Hayden and my brother, Samantha and Vinn asked to speak to our family (me, sister, other brother and parents) and they said that Hayden was rejecting Aria and not wanting to try and be family with her and so they wanted us to start focusing only on Aria and leaving Hayden out so he could learn how cruel that is. None of us were okay with the idea and Samantha spoke up and said that Hayden is older and has known Aria most of her life, she adores him, and he's indifferent to her and shows no kind of love, affection or outright warmth to her and she does not want that to continue. We all said we could not just ignore Hayden since he's a kid.\n\nThey decided to then focus on me after none of us agreed because I am closest to Hayden and they figure it would hurt him more if I were to leave him behind and pick Aria over him. I told them it was cruel what they wanted to do and I accused them of wanting to make him feel totally isolated and alone and asked them had they thought about what that would do to Hayden. Samantha said Aria gets upset occasionally when Hayden won't play with her and we don't seem to care about that. I told her we all care about Aria too but they were asking adults to be a bully to a child. That not all siblings are close and sometimes you just need to accept it and focus on their interests and friendships. She told me I was acting like they were monsters when they are trying to teach a child old enough to know and want to do better.\n\nAITA for accusing them like I did?", "created_utc": 1673600196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10apsuw/aita_for_accusing_my_sil_and_brother_of_wanting/", "score": 463, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My whole internal conflict with this is that I know that blended families are complex and I acknowledge that Aria might be hurting because Hayden does not want to be her brother or even her friend I guess. Maybe it feels like by being so outraged about Hayden that we don't care about Aria when all they want is the kids to be closer. I feel like I could have made things worse.

I ONLY say this because I want what is best for your nephew, and I'm genuinely concerned they'll try to cut ties with your family just to punish him. Is there any chance you could try to talk your brother into family counseling? Maybe a professional explaining to them why this is not okay might help?", "NTA my god they are awful, awful people and I'm guessing he's sensed this of them. \n\nYou do not go about making him want to be part of the family this way. He needs to be given time to come to terms with how his life is now and he will grow to love his extended family, in his own time. \n\nBeing forced and punished, especially in this cruel way will only make him hate them more and his own father to boot. \n\nI'm so glad you're advocating for this boy. I dread to think what they're doing behind closed doors. That poor soul.", "NTA.  Your brother and his wife want to inflict emotional abuse on your nephew because he won't bond with his stepsister.  Your brother has failed as a parent on every level.  Hayden mom is gone so it is his job as Hayden only living biological parent to protect him. Not to emotionally abuse his own child in order to make his wife and step daughter happy.", "NTA. Their plan is [*checks notes*] hurt and traumatise a child to force him to have a relationship with his step family. To \"teach him a lesson\" by *purposefully* excluding him from the family in favour of the step-sister he already doesn't like. To [*checks notes again*] show him that excluding a much younger sibling, of a completely different developmental stage that he has nothing in common with, will result in the people who he loves abandoning him for said sibling.\n\nWhat kind of delusional, playground bully nonsense is this?", "\"You *are* monsters. You want to punish Hayden for confessing his honest feelings to a family member *after you pushed him to do so*! That is incredibly cruel and will likely ruin his ability to trust people. And the punishment you've chosen--to emotionally isolate him from the people he *does* consider to be family--is abusive. Frankly, I'm having a hard time thinking of a more effective way to *increase* his resentment of Aria than what you are proposing to do to him.\"\n\nNTA. No wonder Hayden hasn't warmed up to Samantha in the past 4 years... He correctly senses that she's a bully. \n\nPlease, please try to find ways to be a safe haven for Hayden.

She's right! They *are* monsters!\n\nYou can't force children to like each other any more than you can force adults to. The difference is that adults can make up their mind about those trying to force a relationship on them and leave.\n\nHayden doesn't get that option. Emotionally isolating him is abuse. Full stop. It also teaches Aria ***AND*** Hayden that only *her* feelings matter and that he cannot trust his father or stepmother with his. \n\nNTA", "NTA Their approach is nothing short of cruel. Blending families can\u2019t be forced. It never works out well doing so. I didn\u2019t even have any step siblings when my Mother married my former stepfather and to this day my relationship is very strained with my mother due to my former stepfather being forced on me as a father and his abusive authoritarian tactics. \n\nFast forward to now, I told my mother I just don\u2019t really want to go through the motions with her anymore and pretend like we are ok and that we even know each other on a basic level. So I told her we need to go to therapy or I have no interest in further perusing our relationship. We are currently looking into therapy options. I\u2019m 34 now. \n\nMy point with sharing that there are lifelong affects, and I hope you can let your nephew know in an appropriate way that he always has you in his corner. My aunt was in my corner and she flew me out to the other side of the country live with her to escape my toxic home. I\u2019ll be forever grateful to her.", "NTA- Why is your brother okay with his wife bullying his son? Maybe the issue is that your nephew just doesn\u2019t want to hang out with a 5 year-old girl. I\u2019m thinking like a 7 year-old here, but maybe Aria has boring ideas for playing and he just isn\u2019t interested in the same things as her. Maybe your brother is so focused on making his step-daughter feel like part of the family that he is ignoring his son?", "NTA\nYour SIL basically wants to force siblingship by bullying Hayden. I hope she\u2019s ready for a retirement home and Hayden will land a successful job in order to pay for his therapy.\nIt is clear even for a child that it is impossible to force good relationships. I don\u2019t know why your brother\u2019s family are acting like children themselves", "NTA, you can't force a family to blend, especialla when young children are involved. What you can do is respect the fact that you ARE a blended family. That is, have some activities that just includes the previous two small families and some activites that includes everyone in the blended family. THEN! When everything is settled, then you can consider having separate activities with family members that aren't related from the beginning.\n\nAlso, Hayden is an 11yo boy, it's totally natural for him to think a 5yo little sister is annoying and that they have NOTHING in common. So blended family or not, it's normal for him to ignore her..", "NTA it sounds like your nephew needs someone in his corner.\n\nYou can't force relationships, and his feelings are valid. While Aria has known him most of her life that's not true for him. It sounds like he has good reason for feeling the way he did if this is their reaction to him not playing with his much younger stepsister.\n\n>he's indifferent to her and shows no kind of love, affection or outright warmth to her and she does not want that to continue.\n\nDo they expect that getting his entire family to ignore him and focus on his stepsister will generate any affection for her?

He should be understanding that his son knows who his mom is & knows that aria isn\u2019t his sister. Them trying to force this relationship will only cause him to resent them.", "NTA, I'm glad Hayden has you in his corner. Lots of kids don't want to be bothered with a sibling so much younger than they are. They probably don't have much in common to make Hayden want to hang out with her even if he wasn't feeling resentful that he's being pushed to create a relationship that he doesn't want.\n\nStepmom is out of her gourd if she thinks this is going to do anything to create a friendlier relationship between the two children. She just wants to punish Hayden because how dare he not adore her kid. Ugh.", "NTA. Tell her they are acting like monsters.", "NTA, if they carry through their threat to mentally abuse him I\u2019d suggest going to the authorities.", "NTA.\nI mean, it would probably make the situation even worse, so I am not advising it yet, but this is so wrong that social services could be called at some point. Or maybe the threat of social services being called could wake them up?\n\nNot now. Now your strategy should be diplomacy and trying to make them realize the harm this behavior could create before the situation turns toxic (if it's not already the case.) But if your family cannot stop them, and if the abuse is ongoing for months ... There will be a point where justice might be involved, I suppose.", "NTA. You are right not to bully a child.

I applaud you for having Hayden\u2019s back. What they are trying to do is abusive and likely to lead to long term negative effects for Hayden.

That will teach him a lesson. They are terrible parents.", "NTA, They are monsters! It\u2019s very normal that an 11 year old boy doesn\u2019t want to play with a 5 year old. There\u2019s a big age gap. When he was 7 and she was 2 he also had nothing in common with her. The same will be true when he\u2019s 13 and she is 7, he\u2019s 15 and she is 9, 18 and 12. What his parents are expecting is absurd. His dad remarrying was hard for him but he\u2019s taken it in stride. Honestly it\u2019s awful that they used your relationship to have him confide in you and are now punishing him for it. If I were you I would feel used and angry. He trusted you and now this! He even called you hoping everything would be okay, my heart breaks for him! You have to assure him that his feelings are valid and normal and his parents are out of line. \n\nHe\u2019s not mean to her or hurting her. What do they expect of him? Leave the poor kid alone. It seems he\u2019s alone in the world. As his dad is a major AH. I would confide in a teacher or student counselor at his school what his parents wanted to do so they could keep an eye on his mental health and check in with him. Related or not siblings have all sorts of dynamics and it\u2019s not odd that one\u2019s with a large age gap are not close. My brother is 5 years younger than me and I was probably 23-24 before we started being close. Not that I disliked him, we just had nothing in common. When I was 16 and he was 11, he was just my annoying little brother that got away with everything because he was the \u201cbaby\u201d. His friends had crushes on me and my friends. He always got away with everything. He never could do any wrong and was held to a different standard cause again, baby. Parents can\u2019t control \u201csibling\u201d dynamics and relationships. Trying to force it will only ruin it later in life.

But if there appears to be any willingness there I will attempt it.", ">No wonder Hayden hasn't warmed up to Samantha in the past 4 years\n\nI thought the same.

It read so much like bullying and the worst kind too because it's a bunch of adults bullying a kid if we had listened to them.", "Ugh this sucks because he's so young.  Do your best to let him know you'll always be there for him and even if his dad decides you need a time out, you'll be happy to hear from him when he's able to reach out.

It's great, and if he actually reads what it says the message will be \"validate your child's feelings and show unconditional love\".\n\nMy kids are all related. My 6yo was not ready to stop being the baby and really hated when we had our 3yo.

An 11 year old boy amd 5 year old girl have nothing in common, Hayden is also at the age where playing \"kiddy\" games would cause him to be bullied by Friends. He's just acting like a tween boy, if they don't push it, the relationship will eventually even out.", "NTA. A BIG you can't Force Family. They think it's bad doing this will be the end.

When people asked if he was excited to be a big brother I told them he\u2019s indifferent and I understood because it\u2019s such an age gap. I don\u2019t try and force a relationship and do my best not to put any parent responsibilities on him. Ill occasionally ask him to keep and eye on the baby if I really need to do something around the house but I pay him for doing that. He tells people his brother is annoying (because he cries lol) but he\u2019s actually gotten very sweet with him and will do things to help me/his brother without me even asking.\n\nThey need to understand that you can\u2019t force these relationships. Shoot my brother and I are two years apart and he constantly tried to kill me as a child/teen.", "NTA even biological siblings can feel like this about each other; especially at those ages, and forcing it doesn\u2019t help.\nWhat they are suggesting is abusive.

They are monsters. Love can't be forced and because the poor boy feels no love they want to bully him. \nPlease check in on him as I believe they are abusing him a t home already if they can ask you lot to do this.", "NTA. They ARE being monsters. I am constantly astounded by the stories on this sub of adults acting like kids\u2019 feelings aren\u2019t valid. \n\nHayden doesn\u2019t like her. He has a reason. She isn\u2019t his sister and he has lost his mother. It doesn\u2019t sound like he is being deliberately cruel, just indifferent. He sounds like a smart kid who is able to express himself. \n\nWhat they should do, as parents, is find friends for Aria that she can spend time with. They can\u2019t force a relationship. And they certainly can\u2019t make family members into bullies. Hayden clearly trusts you, and taking that away would be cruel.", "NTA.

Their just creating a bigger problem..  The more they force it, the bigger the divided.  They can't force a relationship...

Isolating him even more will not improve the situation but actually make this worse.\n\nHayden needs individual therapy to cope with the loss of his mom and on how to bond with his step family, and that it is ok to have a step-mom and step-sis and that they won't replace his biological mom.\n\nThey also really need therapy together as a family.\n\nAlso, does Hayden have a pet? Him having a pet and especially a dog if that is possible could help him learn how to bond with others better, he will feel he always has a best friend to turn to and it will help in a lot of mental health areas. With things being so askew in his family, having a pet/dog in his corner could really be benificial and give him strength.

The less adult input the better!\n\nThe little girl needs help forming her own friendships.  Maybe mom or dad could be her friend and do stuff with her.  \n\nOr is that the real problem.

I wouldn't be surprised if poor Hayden asks to live with you, or someone else. It sounds like they're *already* isolating Hayden. That won't do Aria any favors, and it sounds like it's already screwing with Hayden's head. Poor kid, this breaks my heart. I hope they do better, but it sounds like they won't. They're abusive and won't admit they're doing anything wrong...", "NTA with the age and sex difference these kids have zero in common, and Hayden will go to colkeg before she is old enough to have something in common.

Right now it sounds like he doesn\u2019t hate the girl, just doesn\u2019t see her as a sister and that\u2019s alright.
