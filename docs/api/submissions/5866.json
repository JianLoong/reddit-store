Again, I got nothing. \n\nMy Grandad, due to this, has changed his will, so I am the sole beneficiary. This is not much - around 15k. \n\nSince he told my Mum and stepdad about this, my Mum has constantly been on the phone to me begging me to split the inheritance 3 ways with my step siblings. \n\nWe are not close.

There's no such thing as \"the bigger asshole\" here.", "I'm not going to argue that point, but my point was that it's not mom's stepkids he would want to leave a token amount to, it's the mom.", "But then it wouldn't be an AH question, it would be a legal question."]}
