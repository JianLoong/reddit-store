My step siblings had all 4 grandparents. \n\nA few years ago, my step siblings paternal Gran and Grandad passed away within 3 months of each other. They never saw me as real family, so I got nothing, step sis and bro received 20k each, plus a house which they sold for 250k, splitting the money. Again, I got nothing. \n\nMy Grandad, due to this, has changed his will, so I am the sole beneficiary. This is not much - around 15k. \n\nSince he told my Mum and stepdad about this, my Mum has constantly been on the phone to me begging me to split the inheritance 3 ways with my step siblings. \n\nWe are not close.

Both step brother and sister own homes, are married, have good jobs. The inheritance could help me pay off some student debts, go into savings so one day I could potentially own my own home. \n\nMy argument is simple - they did not share their sizeable inheritance with me, so the \u201cbut they\u2019re family\u201d argument shouldn\u2019t apply. I wasn\u2019t good enough family for them at that point. Why should I give them 2/3rds of the money, when they wouldn\u2019t even lend me 20 for fuel when I was a struggling student and they had over 100k each? \n\nI think I\u2019m in the right to refuse, and my Grandad and Dad are on my side. My Mum and stepdad however, say I\u2019m being a selfish AH and not thinking of my family. WIBTA if I kept it all? \n\nTo add - My Grandad is 89 and healthy up till now.

Your mom ugh! . You have all right to refuse . You don\u2019t need to split it . They don\u2019t deserve this . Your mom is an AH ! Its so sad ! . Im sorry ! . Take that money .", "Please don\u2019t give them a single penny. They had around 300k to split. All you have is 15k. Your mom is a horrible mother to even attempt to manipulate you into giving them a dime.", "NTA they aren't struggling financially and didn't do the same for you.", "As the child of rich parents \n\nNTA\n\nMy parents gave each of us 50k. My dad didn\u2019t want to wait till he was dead. That is fair. \n\nMy parents paid off my sisters car for her graduation present in college. They didn\u2019t do the same for me but they paid for my wedding. Fair does not always mean equal. \n\nEvery time they give someone money or assistance the consider the impact on the other siblings. \n\nYour step siblings got an inheritance that is roughly equivalent to yours. It\u2019s fair. You now them nothing. \n\nMy dad gave my sister a really nice camper last year. He was so broken up about how he could make this gesture equal among his other kids. Me and my husband told him not to worry about that. He and my mom babysat our kids for free for like 2 years. Who cares if my sister with no kids gets a camper? He was so worried we would all be mad. No. Fair is not always equal. He helped us in ways we could never measure. We\u2019d never be able to use the camper the way my child free sister would be able to. \n\nLife is about more than money. I refuse to fight with people over money. \n\nYou\u2019re within your ethical and moral rights here to keep the inheritance", "NTA.   Keep the money and enjoy your memory of your grandfather.", "You would not be the asshole!  It goes both ways and if they don\u2019t think of you as family enough then you shouldn\u2019t either unless you genuinely WANT to.", "NTA. Just tell your mom that you\u2019ll be extra nice and give them 10x what they gave you. She may realize that 10x$0=$0, but it might help show the point.", "NTA your mother however is an ah. Tell her very simply\u2026 when your step siblings share their inheritance, so will you.", "Well idk about the US but in Germany there certainly are a few people that are entitled to inheritance. \nTho in this case the stepsiblings aren't.", "That and they want her to split it 3 ways so each person gets $5k. These people who got 200 to 300k are fighting for 5k. Her family is so greedy I feel had for OP. At least grandpa is looking out for her!", "NTA. Fuck em. They didn\u2019t share over 100k (each) with you. 15k is a lovely sum for you, would help you out and is ridiculous to ask you to split considering what they received and didn\u2019t split. Who cares if they\u2019re angry, or your mum and stepdad don\u2019t agree.", "Nice mum you have...why wasn\u00b4t there an issue when the siblings didn\u00b4t share... NTA", "Where does your mother get off spending her Father's money for him? In fact, after you receive it as an inheritance, she is spending it for you. If she is so worried about her step kids that have already received much larger inheritances, let HER give them each $5k out of her own pocket.", "Is this even for real? NTA, NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA!\n\nWow. Your mom has fucking balls.", "What\u2019s your mums excuse for your step siblings not sharing their money with you?\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAnd WOW\u2026 your mom and siblings should really know their place. You gramp *willingly and consciously changed the will* for very good reasons. He is *alive and well and still standing up for you*. They are *way* out of their lines. If anything, this demonstrates they don't need to get a damn penny.", "[removed]", "ESH", "NTA - it is your grandfathers money to leave to whoever he wishes. \n\nHave you raised the point with your mother and step father that your step siblings never offered you any of their inheritance?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Erm excuse me mum and STEP Father, you aren't related to OPs Paternal Grandfather. You are not family, and haven't been since you divorced and remarried somebody else."]}
