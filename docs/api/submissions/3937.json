Your best friend was clearly in the wrong for putting you in the middle and honestly I think texting your friend vs having the conversation over voice chat/phone was a bad choice.  Tone is usually read negatively when negative things are happening. \n\nHonestly, if your friend is willing to throw your friendship away over this, then take the time to grieve.  If it was me, I'd try calling and if they don't answer I'd leave a message letting them know I miss their friendship and if theres anyway to repair it my door would always be open.  \n\nThat way you did all you could.

Always face 2 face or if not a call. \n\nNot saying that is your fault in any way, but this might help in the future.

Life is crazy and in the case that could be the last time we talked, or if something happened to either one of us, I can\u2019t continue with knowing that our last words exchanged were not on great terms. you hold a huge place in my heart and always will.  I will forever appreciate the friendship we had and if you think it\u2019s worth repairing, my door is open.", "Agree. Your friend might also need some time to process his feelings, so if you care about the friendship to a certain degree, I think it\u2019s also okay if he wants to reconcile later and not ready now. \n\nSometimes people just need time to get perspective on bad relationships and come to their senses. \n\nBut then you\u2019re never obligated to reconcile if you later don\u2019t want to too.", "Ok. I wasn\u2019t intervening though, I was going to be the bad guy in the situation no matter what and lose him. If I didn\u2019t send it, he wouldn\u2019t talk to me, if I did, there was suppose to be hope. So I will chose that route again and again because that was the option that best supported our friendship remaining. I respect your opinion but I hope you can see stance on this", "Worth reaching out. I would do voice message or text or email based on what you know B will pay attention to.\n\nI know that sounds contradictory, but when an event is fresh/happening, the face to face or call works because you know they will pay attention and you want to be in the moment together.\n\nBut now, guys haven\u2019t talked in months, but you want to ensure this message is received by B + that B knows the door is open even in the future, if he\u2019s not ready now. So you need something not too shocking, B can\u2019t dodge, and maybe in a form B can re-read or replay if he is too shocked now or not ready now.\n\n-\n\nOn the original question, I don\u2019t think you were an asshole for telling E to grow up - you had good intentions to stand up for your friend. And it seems that E and B made a mess and dragged you into it at some point anyways. \n\nHowever, from a practical standpoint, getting directly involved in other people\u2019s relationship without them asking, can turn out wrong sometimes even with best of intentions. People and life are just complex like that. Let people sort their own stuff out - even if the outcome is the same (which in this case, pretty sure they would have broken up anyways), people want to control their own destiny as much as possible. Only cases for I know of for getting involved are things like abuse or passing along positive information to help their relationship. \n\nJust too unpredictable when getting involved with others relationships. \n\n-\n\nHope you can move on and let the grief pass. You have a good heart but there will always be people like E. It\u2019s never on you when their mess happens. Just learn to recognise, not engage and protect yourself from such people.", "Yes this is a good addition. If he doesn't want to reconcile now doesn't mean it's forever.  If anything,  you can use that time to really reflect on the relationship. \n\nIt's like a breakup, most of the time you'll just think of the good things and not the bad.  Sometimes you have to take the rose colored goggles off and ask the hard questions. Maybe this friendship really wasn't that amazing. \n\nAnd never use \"time invested\" as a reason to keep a relationship/friendship around.  People change, and if those people do more harm than good, it doesn't matter if you've known them since you were in the womb, your well-being always has to be a priority. Don't surround yourself with people that just bring you down or don't respect what you bring to the table.", "B is a shitty friend if he would penalize you for a situation of his own making. Is he really a friend if he's willing to throw you under the bus as soon as his girlfriend asks him to? Why is your friendship and his relationship now contingent on you apologizing for text messages from 6 months ago that he initiated. \n\nYou've been triangulated into this relationship and you need to remove yourself.", "I removed myself 7 months ago. I woke up today and something was telling me I need to talk to him. I just found out a few minutes ago that his dog died. I think it was a sign from above. Who knows", "NTA, AKA \"Am for not giving my friend's emotionally abusive girlfriend what she wanted and continuing their emotionally abusive relationship?\"\n\nI get that you're grieving but this is not a situation you had control over. He made the choice that he wanted her, for whatever reason, and made that his priority. There was nothing you could do that would have resulted in you not being dragged into this, because he was choosing to drag you into his relationship. You did not consent to being a third person in this relationship and you were made one, you had no responsibility to manage their coupling and you still have none.

Reading between the lines here she felt jealous. They fought and the first person he went to was you. He convinced you to do something you didn't want to do. Honestly I think either he has or had feelings for you that made her insecure which would explain why he 180\u00b0 flipped on you after helping by doing what he asked. That being said while I would never expect my boyfriend to go snooping through my phone, I would also never message something that I feel would make him upset if he saw it which is another point against him. Badmouthing your partner to your bf is an AH move especially if they are the gender you are attracted to. It sucks, but I would say ESH. Her and you more softly then him.

For real tho. Never again. Always doing this going forward. Learned the very hardest way unfortunately", "NTA. He will regret this. But he is in an abusive situation and cannot see the forest for the trees. When he is finally (hopefully) rid of her, he will get back into contact with you- and at that point you can decide whether or not to continue a relationship. One of the first things that abusers do is isolate you from people you are close with so they can't stand up for you or get you to stand up for yourself. This is no doubt what is happening. I'm so sorry you are going through this. It is really tough, but try not to take it too personally. I would be surprised if he had any close friends after his time with her tbh.", "NTA. So weird seeing this because I just caught off my lifetime childhood bff over similar reasons lol", "Venting to my best friend keeps me from yelling at my partner over minor issues that hit at a bad time. And prevent me from saying things I don't mean. Like, I'm always gonna talk through problems with my spouse but being able to be irrational when talking to her let's me be more rational with him.", "E is abusive. That's why she is stomping over normal boundaries and acting in any way she pleases while blaming B and anyone he cares about for her actions. B is not childish- B is a victim, though that doesn't invalidate the pain this situation has caused OP.", "NTA. But just drop the both of them. You don't live in the same town, don't need to be around them. They're not together, and you said what needed to be said.\n\nMove on, and if your friend wants to come back and apologise at some stage, then go from there", "NTA - I truly believe your ex best friend will come around.
