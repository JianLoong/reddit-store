When I say best friends, we were literally attached by hip until this incident. \n\nLast February (2021) B met a girl where he lives named E (19f) and they began dating, B moved 3 hours away after high school but we still saw each other frequently. He wanted me to meet her, so he brought her to our hometown to hangout. Her and I got along so good, and for about 2 months we all remained close, I considered her one of my best friends. \n\nHer and B had an argument, B reached out to me via text to vent. I do not like to be involved in any way, but he is my best friend and it is my job to be a shoulder to lean on. He didn\u2019t say much, and in my responses to him I sort of defended E as this situation I understood her side more. There was maybe 6 exchanged texts totals and they were fine not even 20 min later. Or so I thought\u2026\n\nFast forward to Easter, E goes through his phone and looks at our texts. I had not known this until asking why she began to ghost me for a week. She broke up with B and blamed him venting to me as \u201cbeing a part of their relationship\u201d even though B is the one who came to me, and told B she felt as if he listened to my advice more serious than hers. So as you readers can already see where this is going, it was a \u201cher or me\u201d type deal from E. She told B she would not give him another chance until I talked to her and apologized  for \u201cbeing a part of their relationship.\u201d B begged that I do this for him despite him admittedly knowing she was in the wrong. I did it only because I knew how much it meant to him, not that I felt like I did anything wrong. She never responded, she didn\u2019t get back with him like she said, she instead tormented him and emotionally abused him said extremely disgusting things about me. B even caught her back with her (said to be abusive)  ex. At this point, B was in pain so I sent an additional text telling her to grow up. This made things harder for B as she immediately blocked his # and he decided to blame loosing her on me, in which I sent a final text to him as well telling him how I feel about him throwing me into this situation and how hurt I was. He never responded and it has been 7 months since we have spoken. \n\nI thought I did everything I could for him despite the situation he dragged me into and how badly E treated me, and how he let her do so. AITA for sending her that final text and causing this? I am so hurt that I feel I should have let them continue to treat me poorly so I didn\u2019t lose his friendship permanently.

That's how abusers keep their partner's silent. Yes, not everything should be shared, but there is nothing wrong asking your best friend for advice.\n\nYour friend asked, you answered - and from your account, you even took the girlfriend's side over your best friend (so you were not being biased or unfair towards her). You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  You did what you thought was best for B.  It didn't work out.  It didn't work out because B is a childish asshole.   The proof of that is his treatment of you after you bent over backward to help him.  He blamed you for his failure.   Who lets someone go through their texts?  That's childish crap.   If he hadn't done that none of this would have happened.   Sad to say that B isn't the friend that you thought he was.", "NTA. B and E most certainly are though. E made mountains out of molehills and B threw you into an unfair situation, and then blamed you when he didn\u2019t get the result he wanted. I\u2019m sorry it ended that way, but none of it was your fault at all", "NTA!  Your friends just were not real friends when they experienced pressure.  His girlfriend is not emotionally healthy and he became emotionally unhealthy as well. Maybe one day he\u2019ll get the help he needs and you guys can be friends again. Until then, I wouldn\u2019t touch it with a 10 foot pole.", "I think that she might feel second to you but it\u2019s because of something he did or said before this whole thing happened.", "NTA", "E was looking for a way to get you out of the equation. B has to find someone to blame. I\u2019m sorry your friendship ended but you didn\u2019t need to stick around and be blamed for a toxic relationship.

So hindsight we know no matter what, if you are friends with both parties you cannot be part of their relationship disputes. \n\nClearly your friend dodged a bullet with this girl since by going with what you're saying, she seems unstable.  Your best friend was clearly in the wrong for putting you in the middle and honestly I think texting your friend vs having the conversation over voice chat/phone was a bad choice.  Tone is usually read negatively when negative things are happening. \n\nHonestly, if your friend is willing to throw your friendship away over this, then take the time to grieve.  If it was me, I'd try calling and if they don't answer I'd leave a message letting them know I miss their friendship and if theres anyway to repair it my door would always be open.  \n\nThat way you did all you could. And by calling and leaving a message, he can then hear your tone so there's no misgivings of intent.", "Oh hon.

If I was close with the 2 dating parties, I'm of course referring to like the stupid relationship stuff like \"he can't make me orgasm but I refuse to talk to them about it \".", "Thank you. Deep down I felt this but after being friends with someone for so long, it can be hard to admit these things out of being scared of losing them. You are right", "Most people tend to feel threatened when the best friend is the opposite sex (or the same sex of said person is attracted to).  I also feel like that's fine to be that way, but then don't force that person to change and date someone else.  I had jealousy issues but the only person I can change is me. So either I work on my issues or learn to live with them and find someone who was more inclined with the current way I thought.  So after an anxiety disorder, ADHD and borderline personality disorder diagnosis, I had the tools to fix that issue lol.", "Thank you, your response is actually super helpful. I never knew what the next step was, do I reach out? Do I let him reach out? But I think you have pointed me in the right direction. I am going to build up the courage and reach out (through call). Thank you for this.", "lol how'd you figure that out from what she said. Yeah there's a lot of situations where that's true. but from exactly what the post said. Id say you're a wild assumer", "If strictly going by the post, I say that's false. The ex gf was clearly manipulative. I have borderline personality disorder and to me that felt like textbook behavior for the more common symptoms. \n\nOr it could be the friend might not be emotionally mature enough for a relationship.  Or possibly both. \n\nAgain this is just on the information given.", "We spent every single day together from grade school through high school lol. It\u2019s just a figurative form of speech.", "Don't be pedantic.\n\nOP, I kinda feel ESH. Your friend for turning on you, his ex for being shitty, and you for involving yourself once she got back with her ex.", "Of course! xx\n\nI had a situation with a best friend that ended over a relationship too. Either decision I made was going to result in me losing his friendship but it didn't make it hurt any less.\n\nHopefully people learn and mature. Maybe someday everyone will take the lessons learnt and reconnect when they are in a healthier mindset.", "Good for you!  Concentrate on having the happiness that you deserve.", "You're welcome. Never feel like there should be a rule when it comes reaching out.  Over the years, I've realized 99% of the time the other person is always wondering the same thing. That way you leave it in their court. \n\nI don't know the guy, but if he's not willing to stand up for his friend (especially since he put you in that situation) then it's possible you've romanticized the friendship (like you thought he viewed you just as close of friends as he did).  And frankly, personal experience,  when people have asked me about relationship advice (again only when I'm not even remotely close to the partner), I give my honest opinion even if they're the ones being an idiot. A true friend will let you know when you're being an idiot.", "Eh it\u2019s the internet. Scientific levels of certainty aren\u2019t required.

It can be so painful. I hope the same for you and your best friend in the future \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f it would be so nice to rekindle that friendship"]}
