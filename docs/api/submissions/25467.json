Yesterday evening he saw that a new girl at work (shes probably 20-something) had liked the business Facebook page under her personal profile and her business account. Her business happened to be a marketing company. When he saw that, he told me about it and showed me her business page and said that maybe once she knows the ropes around there, he could give her a raise and have her on his marketing team (right now it's just him, but he's been saying he needs more people in marketing). \n\nI was like \"You should shoot her a message and see what her marketing experience is and see if she has any tips or anything!\" So he did.\n\nThis girl got super weirded out by him messaging her. She mentioned like 3 different times \"You're engaged, you shouldn't be dming girls\". She also said she was creeped out by his name on FB being different than how she knows him. His name on Facebook is his nickname that he goes by with family and friends, but he goes by his real name at work. She also said that he \"shouldn't be looking up people from work and messaging them\". But that wasn't the case. He got notified of her and her business page liking his business page and thought it was interesting that she had a marketing business. That's it.\n\nShe was clearly weirded out, so he stopped talking to her, but the way she reacted is just eating him up inside. He said no one has ever accused him of being creepy before and it was really bothering him, which I fully believe because he's genuinely the sweetest, most friendly, outgoing, kind person. In the 9 years I've been with him, I have never seen him have anxiety, but he sounded like he was on the verge of a panic attack. I gave him one of my anxiety meds and that calmed him down a bit, but he still was kind of upset about the whole thing.\n\nSo, is he TA for messaging her? I personally think that girl just has some trauma and doesn't trust men in general and it has absolutely NOTHING to do with him personally.\n\nEDIT: I'm turning off notifications for responses now. Thanks for everyone's input. With the VERY mixed responses, I've come to the conclusion that, while she may have over-reacted a bit, it's understandable why she was weirded out. Neither of us were really considering that it could be taken that way.

I don't have any trauma either, it's weird that he would message somebody from an account his name is not connected  to, it seems like he's trying to be secretive about something.  He should have approached her through work connections,  for example  work email,  and said he saw her business profile because she liked the business account and he wantrled to know more about her experience because he was interested in expanding the marketing department. The very first time she said he shouldn't be dming her because he's engaged he should have apologized, said he will email her through work connections if that would make her feel better and stopped contracting her through socail media. She shouldn't have had to say it more than once.", "The softest of YTAs. \n\nWhile your husband may have had the purest of intentions, it's not up to to two to decide how she perceives that message.  \n\nSending  woman half your age, who may perceive him(not sure of company structure) as an authority figure, is sort of unacceptable these days. That alone is enough to get someone in hot water these days. Sexual assault is no joke, and that is exactly how those stories can start.\n\n\nI mean, put yourself in her shoes. You receive a random unsolicited messaged from an authority figure at work offering you some business help. I hate to make the comparison but, think Harvey Weinstein? \n\nChaulk this up to a lesson learned. We're in a new era.

Yes, that is creepy.

Oh well !", "YTA it's not fair on her to just be messaged out of the blue by some guy she doesn't even know that well, it is creepy", "Sounds like something he could've asked her about at work.

Granted I can see why from her perspective she reacted that way, I think this comes down to generational differences.\n\nFrom what you said it sounds like you both saw it as a way to connect with someone who could help him advance his business, but she thought he was being a creep and trying to open some door via DMs.\n\nAs a man I can understand his anxiety, he might be fearing he could lose his job/fuck up his reputation on this. Hopefully they can sort things out and she sees it wasn't that big of a deal.", "YTA. That wasn\u2019t professional. He shouldn\u2019t have taken your advice. \n\nHe is a senior manager at work. \n\nShe works at his company already. \n\n(ETA: also - if she has a genuine marketing business as well as the work she does for his company, then he was effectively trying to get free advice from her, while neither paying her via her Marketing Company, or via her hours for his company. Why on earth would she do this for free when there are 2 legitimate routes to pay her. Wildly inappropriate!)\n\nThe professional approach would have been to email using work email, or phone, or book a meeting on company time. \n\nContacting via Facebook in these circumstances was inappropriate. (ETA: also, it makes a difference if he contacted her personal Facebook account or her business account. If it was her personal one then there was zero need for that and it definitely would have come across as inappropriate.)\n\nAnd how he handled it afterwards was also wrong. \n\nHe should have sent a short, simple, clear apology for approaching her that way if it made her uncomfortable - explained it was because she made first contact on the company page (ie he didn\u2019t \u201clook her up\u201d). But very short & business like, not an overly emotional essay apology!\n\nAnd then followed up during working hours with a meeting request to her that includes at least 1 other person with a legitimate interest in marketing. \n\n(ETA: literally a 2 sentence apology - along the lines of: I saw your business account \u201clike\u201d our company page when I was doing my (usual stuff as marketing manager - assuming he does manage the Facebook page as part of this role?). Apologies for contacting you via Facebook - I will follow up on whether there are any useful overlaps between your business and ours when we\u2019re in the office next week.) \n\nBacking off makes it weirder & (looks like) confirmation that he was being creepy. \n\nFollowing up via company time & resources & with a chaperone (now required, wouldn\u2019t necessarily have been before) puts it back onto a business footing. \n\nBut he also jumped the gun here. \n\nAll he saw was a Facebook site saying she could do marketing, and he jumped immediately to \u201cshe can come work for me\u201d. \n\nHe has no clue about the quality of her work. Or if she\u2019s a person that he would like to employ. \n\nPersonally I think she has a legitimate concern about his approach - but maybe she\u2019s also got a touch of the dramatic about her. Does he want that on his team? The point is that he has literally no way of knowing at this stage. \n\nIs he often this impulsive at work? As a senior manager? At 40 years old?\n\nHonestly he\u2019s coming across more as a 20-something himself here, for all the reasons listed above. And those things definitely make him the AH in this scenario.

Trying to blame her is just a defensive reaction to justify your own part in this. \n\nAs a business owner I would not connect with another business/person through messenger.

Her response is over the top; people often put nicknames on social media instead of legal names.\n\nShe liked both his personal and business pages and they work in the same area. It was about networking and he did nothing wrong, creepy or unprofessional.", "NTA, her reaction is deeply problematic and inappropriate.  She is in marketing, she is going to have to talk to all kinds of people and make contacts, social media is a fantastic way to do that.  she is going to have to find a way to get over her problems with older men if she wants to be successful in her chosen career.  he should report it to HR and avoid all future contact.", "NTA. She seems excessively immature, he should be careful. Some people live to be victims and her response is a red flag, very negative attention seeking behaviour.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t look her up.

She has issues.", "NTA, but it probably would have been more appropriate to talk to her at work. \u201cI noticed you liked my business page, I didn\u2019t know you had a marketing biz, that\u2019s interesting as I\u2019m looking for some help along that line, let\u2019s talk.\u201d That sort of thing.", "NTA.

And why \u201clike\u201d other business pages, then get accusatory when it generates intended attention and response? Why does she even have a business page? She\u2019s double dipping, or it\u2019s a vanity project.", "NTA, if she has a Facebook page for her business, she should welcome unsolicited professional inquiries. That's how businesses grow.
