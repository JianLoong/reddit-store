{"id": 2379, "submission_id": "yvslwq", "title": "AITA For getting annoyed on my sisters behalf?", "selftext": "My (34F) little sister (28F) has recently started a Psychology degree, which I\u2019m incredibly proud of. However because of the cost of living crisis, she\u2019s also having to continue working pretty much full time (30+ hours a week). We live together, so I try and help as much as I can but unfortunately i don\u2019t earn enough to cover her missing salary as well as my own bills. \n\nShe works in a school that specialises in behavioural children and has a boarding house. Before she started her degree she worked her way up from TA to Head of Care (essentially Head Teacher) in the boarding house, becoming the youngest HoC in the county\u2019s history. She plans on doing a PHD and specialising in behavioural studies, such as autism, as that\u2019s what she has a lot of experience with in her work, and also because I\u2019m autistic along with a few other members of our family. \n\nThe family, including myself are all insanely proud of her. \n\nA year ago, just before she decided to quit her job and go to uni, she started dating a guy she\u2019d known for years. My sister has always been afraid of commitment, but threw herself into the relationship, declaring her partner \u201cthe one.\u201d I was happy for her, although sceptical as I\u2019d seen her fall hard and fast before. A year later they\u2019re still together and she\u2019s still in love so I\u2019m happy for her. \n\nHowever. Recently he\u2019s been making a few comments that have been rubbing me the wrong way. \n\nMy sister is incredibly busy with work and uni. I barely see her and I live with her. She\u2019s at uni during the day, and then works overnight. She goes out with her partner on Friday or Saturday nights for \u201cgame nights\u201d with his friends, even if she\u2019s exhausted. Sometimes to the point that she has asked me to drive her because she\u2019s too tired to drive. And then every Sunday she has dinner with his family. \n\nRecently he\u2019s been making her feel guilty about not spending enough time for him. He keeps making digs about he has to hold her hand all the time so that \u201cat least I know she won\u2019t disappear\u201d, or at dinner the other night he said \u201chey maybe I\u2019ll get to actually see you this week.\u201d\n\nWhen she left the room, I said to him that he was making her feel guilty and that wasn\u2019t fair. She was working insanely hard, to the point of exhaustion, to better herself and to create a better future for herself, and him. Maybe he should stop being so clingy for a bit and look to the future. \n\nMy sister came up to me yesterday and told me to keep my nose out of her relationship and that I\u2019d made her partner feel uncomfortable. \n\nI don\u2019t understand what I did wrong. I didn\u2019t snap at him, I stayed calm, I didn\u2019t use offensive language (I didn\u2019t think). I\u2019m just trying to look out for my sister. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668506201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvslwq/aita_for_getting_annoyed_on_my_sisters_behalf/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He made those comments in front of you, it's not like you commented on things your sister told you in private.", "NTA for the comment up to that point, but your sister has asked you not to butt in any more. If you have any concerns about how he's treating her, take them up with her.", "NTA.  He's got his claws in ... he is insecure and jealous of her potential. \nPlease be careful ... as someone whose abusive ex came between me and my baby sister.. you didn't do anything wrong, but he's taken it and used it this way to create a divide. Big old red flag. \n\nSubtly show her some psychologist who deal with just this issue. But don't say anything more, she needs to realise herself or you become the bad guy.", "You\u2019re nta for getting annoyed on her behalf. However, you may have overstepped when you made the comments to him. It wasn\u2019t malicious, but if your sister doesn\u2019t want you to speak to him about it on her behalf, just apologize to her for doing so, let her know you only did it because you care about her and hate to see her being treated poorly, and let her know you respect her request to not do it and won\u2019t do it again. From now on, just speak to her about how her treats her. Point out the things he does and let her know she deserves better and that you\u2019re there for her, unless of course she also asks you not to speak about it, period. Let her handle it with him, though, I know it can be hard especially when you care about someone, but we always have to respect the boundaries someone has set.", "Oof, as a big sister I get why you get annoyed with someone like him. But instead of telling him you should have told your sister first. Then she could decide what to do with the information. Maybe she agrees with you and will have a talk with him but maybe she won\u2019t. Then you have to set your own boundaries because it is hard to see someone work their ass off and then the boyfriend (or girlfriend) being that clingy. She should be the one to tell him he needs to back off a bit. I get he wants to spend time together but if she keeps doing this she might get a burn out. Then she cannot even do anything at all so also not with him. As a big sister you can only give advise and letting her come up with the idea how to deal with it. Like tell her you see she is tired all the time and you hate for her to be tired all the time and being so busy in the weekends. Maybe she comes up with the idea to have just one social thing in the weekends (like a family dinner OR game night). It is only for a period of time before she gets her degree. She has to have her eyes on the price. \n\nSo OP you are a bit of an AH but one with a good heart. Just explain to your sister why you did it and apologise. And next time don\u2019t go to him but go to her instead.", "NTA.  BF is TA.   He is a childish whiner who tattled to her sister.", "NTA. But keep your mouth shut until your sister complains about it. Then he's be TA.\nYou won't know if she is actually enjoying that or not.", "NTA\n\nIf her bf complained about what you said, it's probably because you hit the nail on the head. He just cannot admit to being in the wrong so instead deflects and puts you on the spot instead. After all, it's easier to deal with someone else's perceived transgressions than one's own shortcomings.", "NTA. You were responding to comments he was making in front of you not chastising him because of anything your sister told you in confidence. If he doesn't want people calling him out on his guilt tripping then perhaps he should do his emotional manipulation in private, like other abusers.", "NTA", "Are you the asshole for getting annoyed on your sister\u2019s behalf? No. That\u2019s what we do! I have a lot of grievances with my sister\u2019s past partners (who she is still friends with \ud83d\ude44). But I keep my mouth shut\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said anything to the boyfriend. My verdict is NAH for the actual question asked (fine to be annoyed), but your sister\u2019s relationship choices are hers to make. If you asked were you the asshole to talk to the boyfriend, then my answer would\u2019ve been Y T A", "NAH\n\nI think it's fair for him to want to spend more time with his gf. I also think its fair for ur sister to want to work on her career. I also think its fine that you stick up for her since you care for her. But this is an issue in their relationship, so let them be the ones to talk about it and try to fix it. Your intentions were right but I don't think its your place to say that to him. Not really TA tho.", "I'm split between NAH and ESH ... this is really nuanced. All three of you are at fault for something, yet have understandable reasons for doing what you did.\n\nYou're trying to look after your little sister and you did the best you could, but don't understand that it's *her* choice to let her relationship suffer at the expense of her studies and career. The boyfriend shouldn't be making comments like that in public, but of course he is going to feel the way he does, when his girlfriend is basically only present on a tight schedule - she has appointments with him, not a real relationship. And of course your sister is doing all of this for a better future, but everything has its price.\n\nFrom a purely moral perspective, all three of you have to apologize to each other and also understand that this was inevitable. But realistically, you're being a third wheel and your sister is correct to ask you to stay out of it.", "YTA. Their relationship is not your business", "I understand you want to look out for your sister, but it's her relationship, not yours. \n\nIf you have things to say, discuss them with her. Or at least say them in front of her. \n\nYou went behind her back to interfere with her relationship and she doesn't appreciate it. And it created a conflict in their relationship which she now has to deal with.\n\nThis guy might not be great with his comments, but it's up to her how she wants to deal with it, not you. \n\nA well-intentioned YTA", "YTA. They\u2019re happy and committed for a year and it\u2019s normal for the bf to feel lonely and left out in a situation like this and he\u2019d like to spend his time with his girlfriend as much as possible and every little time he gets. You may love your sister and want best for her but so is he. He is not asking much. Just don\u2019t interfere with others\u2019 relationships.", "Is it possible to be NTA but still be TA? Cuz thats what this sounds like to me. YTA for butting in but I dont think you had malicious intent so therefore I say NTA. Idk if that make sense but its my judgement", "This is a hard one because she\u2019s your sister and you love her, but she also sounds like she\u2019s intelligent enough to make her own decisions and logic through her relationship. You want the best, but he\u2019s seeing the same of her that you are and if that doesn\u2019t stick in his head, your words won\u2019t. They\u2019ll just cause him to be upset with her, which she sounds like she doesn\u2019t need any more stress.\nI woke say YTA, but I don\u2019t think you meant to be and I don\u2019t think your feelings are invalid. Good on you for wanting the best for your loved ones.", "YTA, your sister can clearly handle her own business, even though you mean well she does not need your meddling", "YTA. While it was very admirable of you to stick up for you sister, it is up to her to shut her boyfriend down on these guilt trips or speak to him if these digs and comments are annoying her.  You could at very least have spoken to her about it not taken it upon yourself to speak for her to her boyfriend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for wanting to protect your little sister, but she is an adult and capable of handling herself. I get why those comments could be triggering, but my partner and I joke around like that all the time, and it\u2019s all in fun. Unless she specifically said something to you, you didn\u2019t really have a place to interject", "Soft YTA. You meant well of course, you see how much your sister struggles with time right now and don\u2019t want anyone to burden her any further, but that\u2019s still you meddling into their relationship and she clearly made you know that she doesn\u2019t want your input. Just respect her choice from now on.\n\nIt\u2019s up to her to decide if his comments are OK or out of line. Imagine if they were already struggling to find balance in all this and you calling out her boyfriend made him decide that he couldn\u2019t take it anymore and left, even though they could have worked through this period. He\u2019s not necessarily a bad boyfriend and unsupportive because he feels lonely and voices it to her.", "YTA if your sister says your were YTA. Your suspicions may be correct, but keep them to yourself and support her as she needs you.", "Idk I\u2019d say slight TA, maybe, cause you waited for her to leave the room. If you had something to say, say it in the moment when it was said in front of you. Then your not butting into thier relationship your calling bs on shit said publicly. Having a private convo with her partner about thier relationship was not your place.", "Esh....you have to let her have her relationship yet at the same time she needs to shut him down before it turns into i don't need you going to school anymore....and he needs to stfu and let her do what she needs to do and stop being so needy.", "That\u2019s absolutely fair enough", "Thank you for this. As someone who has escaped an extremely abusive relationship before, I think I\u2019m a little sensitive to things and which is why I\u2019m a little overprotective of my siblings.", "What? There was no tattling", "If he brings up the issue in front of others, he should expect others to voice their own opinions about the issue. If he doesn't want others to comment on his relationship he shouldn't air their dirty laundry in company.", "Her sisters wellness and health is their business.

I definitely didn\u2019t intend to be T.A. I just know that my sister is feeling like she\u2019s being pulled from every angle at the moment and is feeling guilty that she\u2019s not spending time with him and that his comments are exacerbating that (she\u2019s said that - I\u2019ve not inferred). \n\nShe\u2019s my little sister and after I had a mental breakdown earlier this year I owe her a lot, and don\u2019t want to see her going the same way I did. I just feel like he\u2019s putting pressure on her. \n\nI feel I should add he always makes her go to him. He never makes an effort to come to her; and when he does come to something with our family she has to go and pick him up and he then makes her late because he \u201cwanted to spend time with her\u201d. We had family from another country come and see us over the weekend & they booked a table. She went to pick him up after uni (he finished work 3 hours previous), and they were 1.5 hours late to the meal.  \nShe always has to drive, even though he has a newer and cheaper car. She always has to plan things (weaponised incompetence springs to mind with him whenever anything needs planning).", "I think that\u2019s fair. Thank you.", "Nah. If he\u2019s going to make those comments in front of everyone, then it\u2019s fair game to call him out on his bs.", "She has said that she feels guilty and that his comments make her feel worse and like she\u2019s being pulled in too many directions. \n\nOne of her best friends is going through a difficult breakup, another is pregnant and she feels she can\u2019t be with either of them because all her \u201cspare time\u201d is spent with her boyfriend.", "I agree.  You are being a good sister concerned with her well being.  She will see that and appreciate it in time.", "Yeah... pushing friends or family like this can make it easier for them to spin the narrative they you don't care about your loved ones happiness and are out to sabotage it then push tonhave your loved one cut you out. In this case, he could use it to push her to move in with him then try to say all her free time is his and your sister isn't working on the relationship/doesn't care about him if she uses that time to see other people, especially people trying to break them up, etc.\n\nBe there for her when/if this relationship falls apart and try to work in good motivating or supportive comments. It won't make his comments not exist, but not meddling and giving her love is the best you can do. If she decides to drop out of school to spend more time with him or something, then asking to have a private conversation with her and expressing concern and see if it's just because she's exhausted or hes pushing her to. Unless that happens or he really escalates this behavior, making further comments won't be helpful at all.", "I think we have this in common. Because we done it and been there and we know the signs.", "How did the sister find out anything was said to the nf then?\n\nDid you even read the post?", "All that said, these are still choices she is making. No one is forcing her to go get him. She could put her foot down, and tell him it\u2019s his turn to come to her. She hasn\u2019t yet, and that\u2019s also her decision.\n\nShe has already told you to butt out. You don\u2019t have to like the choices she\u2019s making, but you do have to respect them. You have to trust her choices in her relationship, until when/if you\u2019re given a reason to worry.", "Replied to the wrong spot, sorry.", "Then that\u2019s fair. I also read your reply to someone else how he never makes an effort to come see her. I know it\u2019s hard to see your sister go through this and your heart was in the right place. But next time, voice your concerns to your loved one, not the SO", "I get what you\u2019re saying. It didn\u2019t read like that to me. Before OP replied to my comment it came off like the BF mentioned to sister more in the context of apology. Now that I have more information, I get it.", "That\u2019s a very valid point. Thank you"]}
