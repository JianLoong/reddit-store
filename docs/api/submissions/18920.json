Our house has 2 bathrooms, one for private usage (in our bedroom), and one for guests outside the common area (but we rarely have guests over, so I tend to use it when my sister is in the private one). \n\nMy sister is extremely germaphobic, she hates using stuff that is touched by others (humans, animals, anyone). She will not sit on the toilet if someone has sat on it (yes, even if I sat on it too), or she will take an extensive amount of toilet paper to cover the surface and take a shower later. This applies to other matters such as eating as well. \n\nSince the day we started living together, my sister always bursts into the private bathroom every time I take a shower (My sister broke the lock after opening the lock incorrectly). She never says sorry, never feels guilty and keeps doing it even after I told her to stop and explained to her why it is inappropriate. She says that she needs to use the washroom, and I always take too long to get out. I tend to take a 1-hour shower late at night (most of the time I spend sitting on the toilet, lol) after she is done with her shower first (besides, she also takes a 1-hour shower). I always tell her to use the guest one, but she says it is too dirty since it is for guests. As mentioned above, we rarely have guests (perhaps 1-2 times/year) and I use it too when my sister is using the private one. \n\nI changed the lock today, and my sister just lost her mind since she cannot use the private washroom when she needs it anymore. It's just changing the lock so I can enjoy my privacy, and she is acting like it is the end of the world. I get that she is a germaphobe and I always make sure to clean the guest one weekly. But why is it so hard for her to use it?\n\nEdit: I only lock the bathroom when I use it, not 24/7. She can still have access to it anytime she needs it.", "created_utc": 1685850337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zzy23/aita_for_changing_the_lock_to_the_washroom_so_my/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
