Someone really needs to sit down with your sister and hubby and explain this to them.  Harley needs help and Everest needs protection - both physical and mental protection.", "NTA\n\nBut - you can't make siblings like each other.   I mean, zero tolerance for active abuse, but if bro doesn't want to \"connect\", that's his choice, and Everest will have to learn to accept it.\n\nMight take therapy to help him with it.", "NTA- and I'd say- I don't think you heard me- I'm not accepting the position exactly because I don't want to be forced to observe the situation and not be able to have something to say about it. And if your view is that I'm too much of a kid to have an opinion, then clearly I'm too much of a kid to be watching them anyway.", " NTA.\nYou\u2019re actually staying out of her parenting by removing yourself from the problem. You don\u2019t owe her baby sitting even if it\u2019s paid and I imagine it\u2019s distressing having to watch this weird dynamic play out", "Yea they dont \"grow out of it\".\n\n\nMe and my brother never got along (due to parents showing severe favoritism towards him and me acting out because of jealousy). We're 26 years later and we have gone low/no contact.", "NTA - this is very concerning.  How does she not see a problem?", "Well, you're TRYING to \"stay out of it\" but sis wants a cheap sitter so she's the one making this into your problem. \nNTA, imagine the liability when something goes wrong because it sounds like sister will throw you under the bus first.", "NTA. You are staying out of it, that\u2019s exactly why you\u2019re not babysitting. \n\nTalk about being hypocritical. Telling you that you have no right to judge and to stay out of it all while asking for your help. Lol", "Agree that's not normal bickering. I've heard some real horror stories about older siblings seriously hurting younger siblings because they don't want them around. I'd be making a call to CPS and tell them I fear for Everest's safety and mental health because of older brothers behavior towards him.", "All of this. If their current therapist isn't working, they need to get a new one. They are not addressing these issues the way they need to, and they're setting things up for a terrible relationship for these kids for the rest of their lives.", "Been there, done that thru multiple birth, foster & children by adoption. Agree therapy may be helpful but it starts with the parents getting help, not the child, then progresses to family & individuals as necessary. If therapy is whipped out for Harley alone, it does nothing to improve the family dynamics that cause this - just gives the family a handy kid to blame everything on. Mom & Dad need parenting counseling first & foremost.", "I went through this with my older brother. He was so needlessly cruel to me for my entire childhood. If we were in a room together and he could get away with it, he would beat the shit out of me mercilessly. He also never called me by my name, he usually just called me \"fugly.\" If he was hitting me or throwing things at me and I screamed loud enough for my parents to hear, I would get in trouble for screaming. \n\nI'm a somewhat well-adjusted adult in that I can mask just fine in public or at work, etc, but I know that I'm an emotion wreck underneath that, and I have a really hard time with friendships. I just assume everyone hates me / I'm annoying (which, ironically, makes me try harder to be likeable / funny / smart, which just makes me more annoying!) and even though I *do* have friends, I just assume I'm one step away from them throwing in the towel on me completely. I'm very lucky to have my husband, we've been together for almost 12 years and he's my best friend, and he understands my issues. But life is just so much harder, living like this, and I can trace the majority of my problems back to my relationship with my brother.\n\nI wish my parents had intervened, taken his actions more seriously, or had bothered to protect me at all.", "I'm so sorry,  I hope you can make friend's now.", "I also had a similar situation. I am almost forty and have no ideas how to make friends. It took me a long time to realize how messed up my relationship with my sister was and to go NC.", "Idk, tries to lock him out? Sounds dangerous to me. And I'm sure it's already having an effect on the poor kid's psyche.", "Hopping on here to show you [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx52tm/aita_for_turning_down_a_place_as_my_brothers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), OP.\n\nShow this to your sister and tell her this is what will happen if oldest doesn't get help. NTA.", "It\u2019s jealousy. He wanted to be the only child and is jealous.", "If this comment will help, show it to his parents.\n\nThe older sister closest in age to me made it very, very clear that I did not belong and that every breath I took was stolen from her lungs.  I attempted to ask an adult for help *once* and was instructed to \"try to get along better\" and to \"back away from the sibling rivalry.\"  At age 13 or so I was reading up on how people can die from putting their heads in gas ovens.  My reaction was probably exacerbated by a whole bunch of other stuff going on, but yes, the \"sibling rivalry\" had me on the edge of suicide.  Because I wanted so much not to be a bad person, and according to her I was bad for just existing.\n\nIT DOES NOT MATTER that they are \"just kids.\"  Pain is pain is pain.", "Oh I get that. I haven't spoken more than a couple of sentences to my sister in ten years. The last time I did was because she called me up to tell me that my uncle was dying. She didn't even speak to me at his funeral. Not even a hello. But I've avoided many family gatherings because of that. Being several hundreds of miles away gives me an excuse. But really, it takes less than five minutes for her to piss me off.", "The worst of it is, I\u2019m actually a natural extrovert - I\u2019d love to have gangs of friends and a big social life - but I\u2019m just socially inept! \n\nI\u2019ll happily be your bud though", "Hey, I'll happily be both of your friend. I used to be that way, it took me ages to improve and I still struggle with it. I used to shake when talking to people and would hurdle out of social situations as quick as possible.", "I agree that the youngest i deeply affected. He already voiced his feelings on the matter. Kids are very observant. \n\nThe oldest hasn't tried anything physical yet as far as we know. But if the mom will continue to turn a blind eye he will get bold and do something. I don't even want to imagine what. Kids can be creative so he may do something more dangerous than locking his brother out.", "You beat me to it!", "It actually sounds more like the one where CPS got involved after the 5yo told daycare that he wanted to stay there overnight because he was being bullied and hit by his older step-siblings. School contacted CPS.\n\nThe OP's brother had custody and remarried a woman with kids. The OP was older this this OP and ended up getting custody of her brother's two kids.", "Me, too!"]}
