What if the older brother starts really hurting the little one?", "This.\n\nI've struggled my entire life with feelings of being unlovable, ugly, inadequate, that my slightest failures are catastrophic, and generally being less-than. I have tolerated emotionally abusive relationships because compared to how things were in childhood, it actually felt loving.\n\nMy older sister hated my twin and I because we were born. This came out in the open as a fact by a child psychologist our mother took us to when we were little.\n\nAs kids: our older sister would lock us in closets with the lights off frequently enough that the closet doors were removed for our safety. She particularly did not like me as the more outspoken little sibling, so that twisted little nut job tried to kill me on several occasions as a child. (Her holding me by the hair to force my face in a jar of nail polish remover until I passed out was what prompted the psychologist trip and pixie-bob haircuts for my twin and I.)\n\nAs teens: I recall the day she moved out for college was the best day of my life. I had been locking myself in my own room for a few years to avoid her ire, and I thought I would be set free once she left. Instead, she deliberately came back every weekend until I left for college so that my twin and I didn't get to do anything with our parents without her, and every weekend I was sequestered in my room. She returned for our high school graduation and relentlessly goaded me into a fight by insulting me, calling me names, mocking how I looked/how I moved/my facial expressions for hours straight. She followed me to the grocery store and to restaurants where we had ordered catered trays, etc. just to rile me up before my high school graduation party. I had to lock myself into a room to not physically hit her. I was so angry. I screamed and cried and hit the walls as she giddily stoked the fires through the door until the guests came. I was late to my own party as I was calming down, and she happily enjoyed it. My arms were bruised black and blue from my less than civilized but private explosion, and I still pride myself that I never hit her even though she had hit me hundreds of times.\n\nIn our 20s: She would come to both of my graduation dinners when I got my college degrees and make a scene about leaving early because she was bored, that she hated the venue, or trying to make everyone pay attention to her kids. She definitely invited my parents out to a movie that started 30 minutes after our dinner reservation, and when they refused, she got up, glared at me, threw her napkin down, and stormed off.\n\nToday: She has \"forgotten\" our birthday year after year since high school and couldn't bothered to send a sinhle text message to either of us after being reminded by our mother about what day it was each time. It didn't matter that we had wished her a happy birthday on her day only a month before. She actively ignores my presence, not responding to my attempts at even a polite \"hello, how are you?\" , talking over me when I had been talking to someone else and physically standing in front of me so I am cut out of a crowd of family members. Holiday gifts didn't happen for years, or if there was something, then they were actually a joke that she was playing on us.\n\nThere is more, of course, but the point I'm trying to make is that the behavior doesn't actually improve in time unless it is addressed early.\n\nEDIT: NTA, clearly. Thanks for sticking up for him.", "I would give you an award if I could, because you basically just described me and how I feel about myself.

Come to find out my sensitive personality was all largely to do with the fact that I have Epilepsy and went undiagnosed until I was 30 years old and pregnant with my second child.

He's either neurodiverse (which can be hard to spot if symptoms appear to others to be on the mild side - they can be pretty severe for the person but they mask well), or there's something else going and it won't be pretty.\n\nThe kid needs a thorough assessment by an experienced clinician and they need to explore his hate for his brother.  Most people get over having a new sibling.  There may be a bit of initial jealousy but most move past it quickly.  This is pathological... it's been 5 years and it hasn't improved.  It's actually possibly dangerous for the two boys to be left alone to together for any length of time as Everest may get harmed.\n\nHe needs therapy but I suspect something underlying this and it may be how his brain works.\n\nEverest will be scarred by this, no matter what happens.  He will see his friends have good relationships with their siblings even if those siblings aren't close and won't understand and may lash out.\n\nUnfortunately I have seen something similar with my eldest child.  This kid would likely be fine if they were an only child but that was never going to happen. There's also only a couple of years between each kid.  I have three.  So they were toddlers when the next was born.\n\nThis kid is now an adult and has never had a good relationship with any of their siblings. She has said she's hated them and seems to be insanely jealous of everything but doesn't seem to have any insight that she's gotten the most out of all of them ie extra on therapists and needs.  Most of her jealousy is irrational and it's the perceived injustice.\n\nBut I was aware of it.  I avoided ever leaving them alone.  I have never expected the younger kids to capitulate with her demands ie I want what you've got in your hand so give it to me (nope, don't have to share).  They did not want to share with a sibling no matter how many they had, one, three or 10.  They don't have a relationship now.\n\nBut the two younger ones are very close.  It's not a parenting thing.  All parented similarly.  But that kid is more neurodiverse than their siblings.  ASD but with a PDA profile.
