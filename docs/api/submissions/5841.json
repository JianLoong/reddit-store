He would scream whenever anyone tried to get him to interact with his brother or pose for a photo. All the early family photos Harley is trying to get out of and ones of him and Everest, he was mostly held into place because he would get up and leave. I expressed concerns before, so did my grandparents who live with my parents (and me at the time). My sister and her husband said they were getting Harley some help and he'd just need time to adjust. But he never did adjust. He doesn't want to be around Everest, he rejects him repeatedly, ignores him, yells at him when he asks him to play or for a hug. Everest gets so upset when his brother gets mad at him and he also gets upset when his brother is there and won't talk to him. Sometimes he will not talk to him at all in a day. I have seen it before. I have also witnessed Harley try to lock Everest out and all kinds of stuff. I brought it up again more recently and I was told all siblings bicker and sometimes they are close. Harley has told me before he doesn't ever play with his brother, doesn't ever want to be in the same room as him and will never like him. I have asked him why and he just says because and he doesn't have to and he doesn't care. He also rejects any attempt from me or my grandparents to get them spending time together with us.\n\nSo all of this known... I was asked to start babysitting on Thursday's and Friday's after school for the boys. I have an online store where I sell stuff and set my own hours so I could.

She asked me why, told me if I wanted more money (she started off with how much they'd pay when she asked) and I said it wouldn't work for me. She told me she could really do with my help. I told her it's not going to happen because I do not want to deal with her ignoring Harley's problem which would be most obvious if I were to babysit on a regular basis.

Best to avoid babysitting them in this case, since your sister insists on ignoring reality.  I know siblings don\u2019t always get along, but this case sounds excessive.", "NTA.\n\nBut mainly because your older sister is obviously a lot older than you to have a 10yr old and you are young and deserve to live an unencumbered young adult life free from the responsibilities of shitty kids.\nYou likely don't see the entire dynamic, nor understand the complexities of 2 brothers. This is not your fault, and her kids aren't your responsibility. \n\nIts not entirely abnormal, but Harley clearly has abandonment issues as well as the beginning of neurotic behaviour regarding jealousy and fear.\n\nI would advise not giving parenting advice. Leave it to the older women and go enjoy your youth!", "NTA. She can pay someone else to be liable for any accidents that might occur between the kids while the parents are away.

You would.", "NTA \n\nAny babysitter can decline for any reason.", "NTA. Just read a similar post, the brother NEVER warmed up to the sibling. Hated her until adult hood despite a 13 year age difference and had the same parents (it was implied anyway).

Could there be a deeper rooted issue?", "NTA because not only is she going to have to start facing that neither you nor other paid babysitters are going to want to deal with this bratty behavior but also because NO is a full sentence.
