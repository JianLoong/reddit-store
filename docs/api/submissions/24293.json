If it wasn't just you she spoke to about it, I'd be on the war path.", "NTA. I can't quite word it, but why is this woman (ex's current wife) interested in your daughter's virginity?", "NTA she does need to mind her own business and I wouldn't  apologize.", "Soft YTA- Your ex\u2019s wife is clearly uneducated about the human body- but it likely comes from a very honest place (religious upbringing, lack of education perhaps) it sounded like she was sincerely concerned about your daughter. It also sounds like she came to you versus interfering with your parenting.\n\nYou might not like this woman or the relationship she has with your daughter, but she is in a position to be an ally and come to you with valid concerns in the figure as your daughter hits the teen years. I understand the instinct to keep her \u201cin her place\u201d- but i would apologize for this one.", "ESH.\n\nSure, his wife overstepped, but you went ahead and made it into a confrontation.  It is only going to get worse.\n\nYou all should go to professional counseling and hash out (in writing) a plan of action for raising the kids.\n\nHis wife is involved whether you like it or not.  You have the opportunity to control it, or you can just fight it and let it all go to hell.", "Nta.", "YTA she needs further education on the matter but she came to you, not your daughter, about it out of genuine concern - you should want that from the other adult that\u2019s around your child.", ">This is when his wife texted me...to tell me how they can **take her virginity**\n\n\nWhy is she worried about your 11yo daughter's virginity? The \"taking\" (I hate that term) connotates a sexual act. Why is she putting that on a child? \n\nNTA", "NTA. Not only was she spewing lies, but she was telling them to an 11-YEAR-OLD that is not even her child. I would've been traumatized if some woman told me all that at her age. \n\nGood for you for sticking up for your daughter, and if I were you, I'd be setting some major boundaries with your ex's wife.", "NTA. If your daughter knows about tampons and has a preference to use them, then that's her choice. If she'd prefer to use pads, also her choice. It'd be one thing if your daughter started her period over at her dad's with no forewarning about anything and ex had to walk her through it, but she's aware of what she's dealing with and what she wants to try to use. A tampon might be easier for a more active child, tbh, than the pad full of blood. (and if that isn't put in right/worn properly, it can fall out of shorts/underwear and make a huge mess and depending on where it happens, absolutely devastate her). \n\nIt's nice that she cares, but she also needs to know that you have it covered. I'd also have a calm talk with your ex when you can about making sure boundaries are established early on about her autonomy, because the whole virginity thing has me concerned about her perception on what a girl is 'allowed' and what she isn't. You all need to be on the same page about this, and it all needs to be beneficial for your daughter.", "NTA- you have discussed this with your daughter and made her feel comfortable with the options available with her. She was out of line questioning your decisions regarding your child.", "NTA. She has toxic and ridiculous ideas about virginity, periods, and bodily autonomy. And you're right, she needs to mind her business and your ex needs to communicate to her that she is not to interfere with your daughter using her preferred menstrual product.", "NTA. She should educate herself better as a woman. Shameful.", "NTA", "NTA I would tell your ex if she was really looking out she would have gotten proper information. Not false crap. Also mind your business about her genitals unless the child asks something. Once she apologizes for trying to push false information then you will apologize for absolutely nothing lmao.", "NTA. This woman has no right to say those lies.", "NAH\n\nIf she had gone directly to your daughter without consulting you, I could say where you are coming from.  But she didn't, she came to you from a place of caring about your daughter. \n\nEvidently she needs further education on the topic, but she did nothing wrong in broaching it with you.", "Hey divorced lady, build a bridge and get over it. You are the asshole.\n\nYou lost your right to impose your will on your ex husband when you divorced. Your ex husband has a new wife now. She is part of your kids and your exes life.\n\nYou absolutely need to apologize because you showed her that you are incapable of handling any situation with grace and maturity.\n\nYou know what is sexy?  A woman who is competent.", "NTA.\n\nLet your ex know that his wife is an AH and was spouting off nonsense and NOT looking out for your daughter. Also let him know that if his wife doesn't allow her access to normal hygiene products, you'll be going to court to limit her being around your daughter.", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA .. and I don\u2019t care how you said it. If somebody\u2019s spouting irresponsible, harmful, bullshit rhetoric, that shit needs to be shut down immediately. Until she learns how her own body works, she has no business giving advice to your daughter, or calling you out, because she (God forbid) wore a tampon\u2026 \n\nNo apologies necessary.\n\n\nsteal her virginity, my ass \u2026 ffs", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she shared all her crazypants theories around tampons to the daughter, then she is a total AH, and OP is NTA. If she only brought her concerns to OP, and OP was able to correct her info, then not so bad. I don't know that I think I'd want a stepmom to mind her own business when it comes to parenting a pre-teen. I would hope for all hands on deck. But I'd want those hands attached to the bodies and brains of people who don't believe conspiracy theories.", "NTA and she is an idiot, you don't need to apologize. Tampons don't take away virginity. As long as you explain to your daughter about changing them appropriately to avoid TSS and general hygiene with any product she should use whatever she feels comfortable with. I am sorry your ex married and is defending such a moron.", "NTA - when was your ex\u2019s wife born? 1852?", "Maybe you could argue that the stepmom had a role if she hadn\u2019t lead with patently false and harmful information \u2014 information available to every person with a computer. That leaves her off the list of reliable adults, IMO.", "No, OP is NTA. Concern is \u201cdo you know your daughter wants a tampon not a pad\u201d and when followed by \u201cyes that\u2019s fine, I\u2019m cool with it\u201d the stepmom needed to let it go instead of pushing untrue statements onto the mom.", "Sad thing is, she might actually believe it. When I was in college, I had to explain to a classmate who was in her mid 20show periods work. Because her and her mom both believed that after ovulating and now getting pregnant, the egg breaks open. Said egg is filled with blood and drips out for 4-7 days.and that's what your period is. I was gobsmacked. Or my friend in her early 20s who said you can't get pregnant if the girl's on-top because \"gravity doesn't work like that\".", "I think a grown woman peddling misinformation to shame a child and her mother is definitely an asshole.  She has no business running her mouth about stuff she clearly doesn't understand.  I'm baffled as to how she even survived her wedding night if she's really this stupid, so this seems like a wicked stepmother way the hell out of line.", "Huh? Tf?", "These are things she probably believes herself and didn\u2019t want daughter to have issues. And she brought her concerns to mom, not daughter.  \n\nHer information is wrong, her concern is appropriate though. If she were the AH, she\u2019d have tried to ban tampons from the daughter and said this BS to the daughter - she didn\u2019t do that.", "Mer? DB?", "The fact that she asked the mom and the mom said yes should have been the end of the conversation, tbh. The fact that it went beyond that to her womansplaining a tampon to another woman regarding that woman's child? Nope. Back off."]}
