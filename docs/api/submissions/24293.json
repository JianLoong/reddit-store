A tampon might be easier for a more active child, tbh, than the pad full of blood. (and if that isn't put in right/worn properly, it can fall out of shorts/underwear and make a huge mess and depending on where it happens, absolutely devastate her). \n\nIt's nice that she cares, but she also needs to know that you have it covered. I'd also have a calm talk with your ex when you can about making sure boundaries are established early on about her autonomy, because the whole virginity thing has me concerned about her perception on what a girl is 'allowed' and what she isn't. You all need to be on the same page about this, and it all needs to be beneficial for your daughter.", "NTA- you have discussed this with your daughter and made her feel comfortable with the options available with her.
