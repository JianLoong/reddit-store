Not that I think employers are necessarily good people, but lying to them about availability is usually a recipe for your co-workers not liking you (as I learnt when I got a job at 21 that I didn't intend to keep and told them I would, my coworkers trained me and were nice to me and then some of them felt bad that I had lied)", "Look you're NTA because you do you but as someone who is in the same boat every year with aging parents in India, let me say two things :\n\n1. There will ALWAYS be more work. You've got decades of it ahead. Don't worry too much about it. This decision rabbit hole just deepens every year.\n\n2. There are days - days far between - when I wish for that one more day with a parent who isn't there any more due to Cov 19. If you can get that one more day now, take it. Life doesn't wait for work", "NTA. Your parents can't have it both ways, get a job now quit it.", "NTA - your plan to volunteer would have given you the flexibility to be able to make this trip, but your parents insisted and forced you to get a job. Now they want you to leave your employer in the lurch and be a complete AH yourself by taking off for a month when you made a commitment to a job. Who is the one that can't handle accountability? I'll give you a clue, it isn't you. I am no pro-employer bootliker, but if they gave you a job with a fair wage and have treated you appropriately, you do have a minimal moral obligation to meet your side of that contract. All your parents are doing is demonstrating that they feel it's fine to order you around and then screw with other people just because that's what they want. They are the real AHs here.", "NAH\n\nI wouldn't call it an AH move, but that job is really just not that important to stir up a family drama and miss seeing your grandparents\n\ntell your boss that you need to come with your family, they quite possibly will accommodate you. Nobody is expecting long term commitments from 19 year olds college students", "YTA to yourself.  Opportunities to travel and spend time with family like this will sharply decline as you get older.  I'm middle aged and I'm going to tell you what I what I wish someone had told me when I was your age:  Go on the trip.   The job you think is so important right now isn't important in the long run, and it's easily replaceable.  The experience of travelling with your family is irreplaceable.", "NTA. Lots of my friends with family overseas take extended vacations. So, that's not unusual to me. However, if your parents supplement your needs by paying for your education, or allowing you to live at home, you have more than one master to please, unfortunately.\n\nI understand that your \"job\" is important to you and that should have the most sway, But, some families put up a lot of money, so that they can visit international family and maintain family ties. Its part of being a member of such a family in many cases. And people feel they need to make the visit worth the expense. \n\nSo weigh your dependence in this situation and consider it. Its not the only factor, but it is an important aspect of this experience.\n\nNTA. I hope you get your wish. (But, I can see your parents side too.)", "NTA. But, you will be if you don't go on this trip. It's been a long time since you saw your family and you may not get another chance to see your grandparents if they are frail. I would hate for you to regret this choice for the rest of your life. Your family is important. I think it's admirable that you want to be a good employee. I would argue that this job is not worth changing your travel plans. Ask for the time off. You may be surprised. The boss may be annoyed, but if they are short-staffed they will be happy to have you return in a month. \n\nI think it's crap that your mom advised you to be dishonest. That is a terrible lesson to teach you. I do not blame you for her behavior. She clearly wants you to stay with the family for the whole trip which is why she waited to speak to the travel agent.", "NTA. A good job isn't easy to find these days, and as nice as it might be to visit family I personally would prioritize my own future over a visit. There's always next year, when you actually have paid vacation from work.", "YWNBTA\n\nNOT going to india is the reasonable decission. Priorize your job.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents are aholes for making you get a summer job when you were planning to travel. Now they expect you to drop it and go.\nTbh I would go as time goes past too fast and people don't live forever. Sucks that you really like the job and will lose it but jobs come and go.", "One of my friends did not want to send her kid to Nigeria to visit her husband's family because she thought he was too young to go without her. (And her husband died many years ago.) And now he doesn't know them as well as he should because she did not let him go with her husband's sister to visit the family seat.\n\nWe make tradeoffs a lot. And sometimes later, we wish we'd done things very differently?", "Give them notice NOW. That wouldve been the right thing to do is to tell your job a month (or more) ahead, not 10 days! And if youre not leaving at the beginning of June you still need to tell them ASAP. This is so they are not scrambling if they need to hire someone new and make a transition plan. Tell them your family is not allowing you to stay even though you would rather work and that you apologize profusely for the situation. And tell them you know it is a big ask but that you would be happy to return to work if they'll have you.", "It depends what you want to do but here are my 2 cents: job can easily replace you (it won't matter much for your boss if you went or not, people are being let go all the time for no reason). Family won't replace you easily.", "Do your own search for flights; I find it very difficult to believe there are zero seats available leaving India on any given day. (Maybe on that airline, which is why I said try to find your own ticket.) Go for the 2 weeks. I would give everything I own and everything I could steal for one more day with my grandparents."]}
