I caution that I am not Autistic nor a specialist in ASD. \n\nBut I vote NTA only because you were telling her the truth. While fantasies aren\u2019t harmful per se, if someone is fixated to a point where it could affect their mental health or wellbeing, or escalate to behaviours of concern, then I don\u2019t think you were doing anything wrong to nip it in the bud.\n\nThat said there\u2019s follow up you need to do with your niece, and perhaps you need to contact her parents about what happened and let them know, because they should know and they may have advice for you.\n\nBut I stress again my opinion comes without knowledge or experience or ASD so I defer to those people.", "NTA.\n\nI'm autistic, and I think your niece is projecting onto this woman because she's lonely. Autism can be very isolating. Before I was diagnosed and had a name for it,  I used to describe it like being an alien trying to go unnoticed amongst the humans. My brain just didn't work like other people's did, and I desperately wanted it to so I could be like the other kids. \n\nYou niece might not have the life experience yet to describe what she's feeling, but she wants that same acceptance and love that other people have with their friends. I hope she finds the (age appropriate!) best friend that she's dreaming of.", "NTA, though to her right now, you're a big old dream-smasher.\n\ndepending on the situation, it probably did not need to be said at this time, and you're likely right, the issue probably should have been left up to her parents. ~~If she's simply having fantasies about having a cool, older sister type of friend, and not bothering this neighbor or talking to her more than is appropriate, there was no reason to crush what is essentially a thought game to her.~~ she simply enjoyed imagining these scenarios, and she probably doesn't have a lot of people in her life that she feels like she has that relationship with, so it was fun for her to fantasize. You've more or less taken that fantasy away from her and she's hurting. You should apologize, whether or not you are correct (you are, objectively), what Niece heard was \"your dreams are impossible\".  \n\n\nEDIT: Learned niece has actually been following neighbor around. that is unacceptable and kind of needed an abrupt \"you need to stop\" comment. Parents should be informed and handle further teaching niece about appropriate social interactions.", "NTA. It was an unpleasant but necessary truth", "NTA. Hi I'm autistic, It probably could've been handled better or left to parents but if shes following said neighbor then she did need to have that wake up call. harsh or not that kind of thing needs to be nipped in the bud asap", "While I think we should encourage inter-generational friendships, this is not a good situation. The neighbor isn\u2019t facilitating any relationship so your niece needs to understand that it really sucks but she can\u2019t bother her anymore.\n\nNTA", "So I'm autistic, granted it's high functioning but I can tell you that didn't change how othering it made me feel. We didn't realize I was autistic growing up, but I always knew I was different from the other kids. It's hard to explain, but imagine all your peers are dressed up and acting out a play together. And you are in it! But it's not right. \n\nYou are one of snow white's dwarfs trying to fit into Cinderella's story. The directors (adults) try to fit you into the play, but you know you don't belong there. \n\nIt might explain why she formed an attachment to your neighbor. Adults tend to feel safer, and this adult was friendly to her! I've been there before, that can feel life changing to a lonely little kid. Doesn't make her behavior ok or excuse it in any manner, just trying to help you understand. \n\nBecause that makes follow up steps easier. Definitely contact the parents when you can to let them know about the situation, they might have advice on what to do/how to talk to her. Because I do suggest sitting down and talking to her.\n\nMake sure she understands SHE wasn't being bad, but her behavior wasn't appropriate. Obviously the heavy lifting is parent's responsibility, so you don't need to deep dive into this if you aren't comfortable with it for any reason. \n\nI'm unsure how close you are, but this can help establish (or re-enforce) the idea you are one of her 'safe' people. Someone she can turn to when in need.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Suggesting the kid plan activities with someone her own age would have been a more appropriate response from you.\n\nActually, I am going to say YTA. I was involved in something similar when I was younger (just a kid and an adult having friendly conversations), and I hold resentment towards the lady who stuck her nose where it didn't belong to this day. If you thought there was a problem, you should have asked her parents. It sounds like this was not new behavior from the kid. There was no reason for you to think you had to school her on anything while her parents were out of town.", "YTA. Your niece is either very lonely, very gay, or very both. Her fixation on this woman sounds like a \u2018puppy love crush.\u2019 (I\u2019m a gay woman, FYI.) You say she is starting puberty and is fantasizing about \u2018playing house\u2019 with this woman! \n\nThis is something for her parents and therapists to deal with. She needs to be empathetically taught how to deal with her emotions in am appropriate way. She needs people making sure she has appropriate social connections and isn\u2019t horribly lonely. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need someone impatiently stomping all over her first crush. You went nuclear on an autistic kid. Like c\u2019mon.", "Thank you. My niece DOES bother the woman, though. She will follow the college student around, contact her online, and even look for her around the block.", "Good point in calling the parents. they're surely familiar with this behavior and may know how to advise aunt on next steps.", "Thank you. It is helpful to hear from another autistic individual.", "I know you cannot represent any Autistic person except yourself but I\u2019m curious to understand. If you\u2019re okay to indulge me:\n\nHow do you like to be communicated to if a NT think your behaviours or thoughts are concerning for them like in this scenario?\n\n(As a NT person I can see just how much we swaddle things with each other that could be confusing, instead of a direct approach which can be taken as harsh or blunt.)", "Niece was following neighbor and has been attempting to contact her online. that's simply not appropriate for a child to be doing to anyone, let alone a grown adult.", "It's worth mentioning that OP said the following: \"_my niece DOES bother the woman, though_\"", "this actually changes my answer, I will edit in a minute. harmless fantasies are one thing, harassing and following a stranger is altogether another. augh. I feel bad for both of em.", "This is the kind of important detail that needs to be in the OP for people to give you a valid judgment.", "Yeah that\u2019s not good (yes I get she\u2019s ASD but if she\u2019s following around it\u2019s an early flag for parents to work through with niece and specialists). \n\nPlease talk to your sister and let her know what happened. \n\nYou clearly are reflecting on it and this is a learning experience for you regarding your niece so let them know so it can be worked out (they may need to contact the woman to check in with her too). Also in te of your relationship with niece cause you e hurt her feelings", "I always think as a rule if you\u2019re babysitting someone\u2019s kids and there\u2019s crying involved: inform the parents. Never cover things up, always let them know so you or they can fix it.\n\nWhat happened with OP has added layers of complexity.", "Just tagging on to say, as someone who was profoundly lonely as a child (homeschooled amd AuDHD), I absolutely could have seen myself doing something like this. The harsh wake up call was absolutely necessary and in some ways better coming from you as opposed to her parents. But I hope you can find a deeply compassionate way to meet her in the extremely vulnerable space she's at - to validate that yes, a close friendship is a wonderful, healthy thing to want and its sad she doesnt have that yet, and yes, one day you'll be older and more independent and you're going to have so much fun, and yes, you *are* likeable and we just need to focus on finding (age-appropriate)friends who are able to appreciate you and enjoy you like I do.\n\nI was so chronically afraid I'd be alone and misunderstood forever. My heart honestly hurts so much for her. Loneliness is a whole other kind of pain...especially for those of us who feel things so damn deeply.\n\nBut, to reiterate, NTA", "I can't speak for the entire community, but for myself I think you've hit it on the head. Bluntness or directness is often seen as rude, but I don't receive it that way. I might not be happy about what's being discussed- like OPs niece being devastated to find out the neighbor isn't her friend- but being direct helps because I don't have to 'decode' the conversation and deal with a stressful topic at the same time.", "It\u2019s still something that can be dealt with empathetically. You can explain to the niece that has to let this woman contact her without completely destroying her.", "Thanks for sharing your perspective. It\u2019s certainly been what I\u2019m hearing from ND friends - unvarnished truth delivered kindly is best. \n\nWhich is why I went NTA. Now what\u2019s needed is mopping up to help niece with her feelings (something to be guided by her parents but acknowledged by OP to niece).", ">!without completely destroying her.\n\n\nBased on what OP wrote on her post and comments, I don't feel we have been given enough information to make a fair judgment on whether her words were emphatically enough or not. My understanding is that OP didn't sugarcoat her words, instead she was forthright.", "As an autistic parent to an autistic child you absolutely are NTA. Her parents should have nipped this in the bud. It's the job of parents to teach their children boundaries and it is even more crucial with autistic children that they are taught boundaries. Your niece is upset now, but you weren't wrong. Maybe try to continue the conversation later and explain why her obsession with this 21yr old isn't okay. Explain what appropriate relationships look like. Also maybe look into local groups for kids your nieces age so she can make appropriate friends? It sounds like she is very lonely and needs a friend.", "NTA. It is important for her to learn that kids cannot be best friends with adults. This is for her safety, and also to avoid her feelings getting hurt more.", "Yta kids have fantasies so let her enjoy life", "NTA. Honestly it\u2019s *dangerous* for a ten-year-old to believe that an adult can be her best friend. Presumably this college girl is harmless, but that\u2019s the kind of belief that could lead an autistic child to being exploited.", "I think you coulda been a little more gentle about it, but at the same time, she needs to know that if an adult is trying to make friends with her it\u2019s probably a weird situation.", "The kid was following the adult around, that's not good for anyone", "Fantasizing is fine but following the person around is not", "Are her parents aware of this? Are they doing anything to get her to stop? This behaviour can be dismissed as harmless while she's a kid but unless her parents teach her to behave she's going to grow up into an adult who still does this. Just because she's autistic does not mean she can't learn, anc if her parents won't teach her they're harming her", "This needs to be added to your original post. The whole truth is important."]}
