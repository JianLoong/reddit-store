I never did this with brand new movies that might be sold out. \n\nI'm including that because I fully understand the desire to see a movie for free.  \n\nThese days however the closest theater to me is a big 12 screen behemoth. And while they do have a couple of smaller rooms where they play standard films they mostly have theaters with bells and whistles.  IMAX, 4DX, 3D, you name it they have it. \n\nAnd it all costs extra.  \n\nI took my kid to see the new Antman movie and each ticket cost almost $18. We got there with enough time to get our popcorn and stuff and head in. \n\nWe were going to sit in the seats that move and rumble along with the movie. And they are in the best spot for the screen. And since they are assigned we could show up whenever we wanted and still have the best seats. \n\nBut there your what My Cousin Vinny would call \"yours\" sitting in our assigned seats.  I politely explained that we had paid for the seats and that they needed to move.  They wouldn't. Move. My son said just to leave them but then we would be sitting in someone else's seats. All the seats are assigned these days.  \n\nI asked them to move a few times more but they wouldn't. My son went and found a different place to sit and I went to get the manager. \n\nBy the time I got back there was some lady giving my kid crap for sitting in her seats.  \n\nThe movie was delayed while the manager dealt with the kids in our seats and they were kicked out when they didn't have tickets.  \n\nThe movie was pretty good but my son says that I shouldn't have caused a scene and gotten those kids in trouble for something he knows for a fact that I used to do.", "created_utc": 1677330686, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bkok4/aita_for_making_a_scene_at_a_movie_causing_a/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They refused to leave seats someone else had bought.\n\nA wise man once told me to only break one rule at a time.  Sneak into a movie,  then make sure you are respectful of those who paid to see the movie.", "NTA.  If you are going to break the rules be inconspicuous. Like you said. Don't do that sort of thing so early on in a movies theater run. \n\nI did the same when I was a kid but I would be in half empty screenings. Not taking assigned seats that cost extra.", "NTA.\nThings are different now! As you mentioned, now all seats are assigned and the only possible way to have other seats is to wait till everyone else sat down and you take what is left.\nLife has gotten more and more complicated, and what was simply \u201cnormal children mischief \u201c is now highly unacceptable. Hypocritical, of course! But this is how it goes.", "NTA. Seats were assigned. They broke the rules, which subsequently resulted in you and your son either having to also break the rules or asking the manager to assist. You did nothing wrong. Also, just because you used to do it, that doesn\u2019t make it OK now, especially not in the world of assigned seating in theaters, where the activity can directly impact others.", "Nta \n\nTeach your kid to stand up for himself and not be a doormat.", "NTA bc then you couldn\u2019t have seen the movie if the seats are assigned like we\u2019re not just gunna leave sorry kiddo", "NTA you paid for your assigned seating, people can't just take ya shit and get away with it.", "NTA. You needed your seats because you couldn't take someone else's. And those kids were breaking the law.", "NTA\n\nStop using your child as a moral measuring stick. You already know that the movie theater experience of today's mega theaters is not the same as yesteryear's small town 2-3 screen theaters. The seats are assigned, and someone took your seats. You went through the proper avenues to address the issue. \n\nI think the bigger problem is your child losing their spine when confronted with a minor confrontation. I don't know if your child is suffering in other areas of life, but maybe get them an appointment with a therapist. The last 3 years have been rough on all off us, but most of all children. Help build your child's confidence to stand up for themselves.", "NTA. Your son needs to understand how to deal with situations like this. Good job standing your ground. Would have done the same.", "Based on the title  I was ready to go the other way, but then you reminded me and I remembered hearing about how movie theaters in their last ditch effort to fight the inevitable losing battle to people having 80 inch TVs at home being the norm and less likely to feel the need to see anything but the latest action blockbuster packed with stupid dialogue but tons of guilty pleasure special effects in the theater that they theaters were starting to charge people for specific seats now, but I digress. I say NTA because, you pay extra for a specific seat, thats the seat you are entitled to, the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour son does not realize the chain reaction of events he was causing potentially by trying to \"let it go\", he ended up taking someone else's seat that she paid for, as you mentioned. He doesn't seem to understand that yet. And then whats next? That lady who was yelling at him has to find a seat somewhere else that someone also paid for? All because some people who didn't pay were stealing from both you and the theater. Your son I'm not sure how old he is, but probably old enough that you should invite him to think it through.", "NTA- seats were assigned to you not them. My theatre only turns on the seats that are assigned which means you moving to another seat isn\u2019t a solution", "Nta.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t cause a scene. The AHs who refused to move out of your assigned/paid seats caused the scene. \n>\nIt\u2019s an important lesson for you kid to see that it\u2019s okay to stand up to bullies.", "NTA\n\nThose kids are stupid for sneaking in and not moving.  They should be polite and try to go unnoticed.  Stupid entitled generation.", "NTA\n\nGood on you for not letting these kids get their way. Your son needs to learn to stop being a doormat", "NTA yes, things are different now. In a previous era, there would have been lots of empty seats and no harm done. Now, tickets cost a fortune and seats are assigned. You taught your son a good lesson. He might not realize it for a few years.", "NTA If they had gotten out of the specific seats you had paid for, you wouldn\u2019t have gotten the manager, caused a delay, or anything. They started with a relatively petty offense, but kept doubling down with epic stupidity. Explain to your son that if you\u2019re called out when you\u2019re in the wrong to begin with, the smart move is to apologize and avoid a foolish confrontation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You get the seats. Simple as that.", "NTA - agree with you on everything. I hate how expensive movies and popcorn have got! I still go infrequently to see the big movies that come out. I do like that you can buy assigned seating because I like a certain row and I always get those seats in that specific row. I would 100% absolutely not be OK with someone sitting in the seats that I selected and paid for. 100% would get the manager.", "NTA i get what your saying about what you did but back then cinemas were nothing like they are now and we never had seats reserved you just turned up got a ticket and watched the film.\n\nIf you have paid for the best seats, why would you give them up?\n\nI get kids being embaressed as its a public place and ppl are watching but sometimes you have to stand your ground.\n\nI was with my 3 daughters in supermarket carpark and some woman in a car was stationary just pass the pedestrian crossing. I assume someone was pulling out so she couldnt move so as crossing was clear we walked across she then reversed obs without looking and hit my 2 daughters then just pulled off and drove away. By the time i got to the shop front she just started to drive pass so i went up to her car and confronted her. My girls were like, omg mom stop it and tried pulling me away and said stop it ppl are watching. I couldnt understand their reaction as that woman just reversed into them and the youngest she hit was only 7 and my 15 and 10 were mortified. Ok i was angry but she just reversed into my kids and drove off,  i just knocked her window and said, you do realise you just reversed into my kids and then drove off, the least they deserve is a sorry. She knew what she had done but was hoping to get round car park and exit before i caught her up. Before i could say anything else my kids ushered me into the shop and then proceeded to be angry at me for causing a scene and embaressing them. I got angry with them as im litrally sticking up for them! \n\nI bet if i hadnt stood up for them they be angry with me for not addressing they got hit by a car and i didnt care. Kids hey!", "You didn\u2019t cause a scene,the jerk kids did that.", "NTA. You should get what you pay for. What right do they have to sit in your seats? Your son should understand that it\u2019s important to stand up for himself in situations like these. Entitled people deserved to be called out. Besides, it\u2019s not like you were the only one angry as another woman complained. AND the kids didn\u2019t even have tickets\u2026. Like c\u2019mon.", "NTA.\n\nAs a former Cinema staffer, many of those motion seats are activated when the seats have been sold. If its an unassigned seat, its not going to move. If you sat in another seat, you would be missing out on a aspect of the ticket you purchased. If you were in 4DX, the seats move as smaller sections, so any theatre jumpers could sit anywhere and experience the show.\n\nIf the kids had waited until just before show time, they may have seen which seats were sold and picked somewhere else.", "On the one hand, you have a point. On the other... That's a nice glass house.", "That rule is known to me as \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid shit when you\u2019re doing stupid shit!\u201d", "That is an exceptionally wise statement.  It is usually when you try to parlay a 2nd or 3rd offense that you wind up getting busted.", "Former theatre manager here, thats exactly right if they did not cause a problem less likely anyone would make the effort to kick them out.", "It's not the same at all. OP didn't take issue with the sneaking in.  It was with the not moving part.  The kids are stupid for letting themselves be noticed.", "Nope, not the same thing. Yes, both kids snuck in without paying. But now with assigned seats, especially for popular movies, sneaking in just doesnt work anymore. If OP and kid could have sat somewhere else they would, but they couldn't. Sorry kids, it's not the good old days.\n\nGosh, do you think 1 reason theaters implemented assigned seats was to stop the sneaking in without paying crowd?\n\nNTA.", "I'm aware that I did the same thing. I included it in my post to try and be fair.", "The ones in the glass house are the kids who are dumb enough not to move for a paying patron when they are breaking the rules. Had they have moved when confronted about being in someone else\u2019s seats, they wouldn\u2019t have been kicked out. \n\nDon\u2019t draw attention to yourself if you\u2019re breaking the rules. They tried to be sneaky and were bad at it because they couldn\u2019t show common decency, so they got caught.", "Much more eloquent. :)"]}
