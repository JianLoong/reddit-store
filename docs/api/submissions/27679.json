At any rate, my only issue with people borrowing movies is that they return them and file them away so I don't have to.

I refuse to assign a monetary value to the more than 2,500 discs I have collected over many, many years.

When my niece was 3 or 4 for whatever reason she like to \"borrow\" things. I think she just got a kick out of it. Her parents would drop off whatever she \"borrowed\" a couple of days later.

My mother did this with my books but she complained I didn't cater to her tastes enough. She used to bend them and break the spines. Some were very expensive as collect books. She didnt care and if I complained, then all was why was I so stupid to spend good money on old books and did I realy value a book over her? Better not to lend to someone you don't trust.", "A mother he doesn't get on with. I'd rather lend to a stranger in many cases than family as with strangers, they normally respect it enough to give you it back. Family, no it becomes their's and you have to accept theft or damage because you aren't going to break up family over a possession are you?

It's a long story, but she was never there for me. My Dad raised me. So, I'm not really close to her at all.\" So not sure why she was there and whether she was welcome or not.  Sometimes you tolerate family menbers because you want to see the rest of the family.\n\nWhere she shouldn't have been is in his basement rifling through his possessions deciding what she wants to \"borrow\". Borrowing normally means taking 1 or 2 with permission not looting someone's collection to create your own.", "This is my biggest issue with this subreddit. You guys attract things outside of what the OP said. If his problem was her taking irreplaceable ones or impossible to find ones then I get that. But that\u2019s not what he said. He said that she \u201chad over $600 worth\u201d meaning the money was his problem. Not the rarity of it. And my limit on borrowing depends on what I have. If I have at least $3,000 lying around and someone wants to borrow $600 then I\u2019ll help.

You are asked to comment on a topic based on own opinions which are shaped by your experiences. Your experience is if you have $3,000 about then you are happy to lend $600. You are very generous, more than anyone else I've met. And you only think of products in terms of financial value.\n\nMy experience is that if you collect, then people assume that because you have a lot then they get free grabs and that just isn't so. You ask to borrow because you don't know the value or worth to the individual. \n\nAnd yes, fair point - he showed her the basement. He didn't give her permission to borrow anything at all.", "It\u2019s not that I think of it in a financial value. That\u2019s how OP placed it. He didn\u2019t even say how many movies she took. He didn\u2019t give examples. He said \u201c$600 worth\u201d. That was his worry. Not the rarity. He didn\u2019t say \u201c5 rare movies\u201d I comment on what they say. Not speculation", "NTA. I am a collector myself. Anyone who just goes through my stuff and grabs whatever they want to \"borrow\" it will get a smirk and gets shown the door - without the stuff.

I used to have a bookshelf filled with Blurays, and every time my wife\u2019s family or friends would come over they assumed they were free for grab. I had to constantly ask my wife to ask them to bring them back. One day I had enough and started looking at setting up a borrowing system where I would scan the barcode of the disc before loaning them but it was just too awkward to do, so I ended up moving 100% to digital, was not worth the stress.
