You can't dictate what he does but if something really bothers you, there needs to be some understanding on his end. I'd recommend putting this in a stepparent subreddit and gaining insight there.

You\u2019re effectively banning the kid\u2019s mother or father from some of the important events of their life because you don\u2019t want them to be in the same room together.

They\u2019re both entitled to time with their child and it\u2019s not fair to the kid to say he can only have half of his parents at a time.", "YTA. How did you not talk about this before marriage??? You got married and didn\u2019t discuss how him and his son would interact with the ex??? I had a step mom with a step sister and it was hell, because my dad prioritized her and forgot about me and my sibling. Don\u2019t do that to his son. Blended families are so hard, but it\u2019s going to be a compromise for you and the son for the rest of your life. It sucks that the ex doesn\u2019t like you, but she\u2019s going to have to compromise on this too and have you around for events. Your husbands son is lucky that he cares about him so much.", "YTA! Your husband is a father, and an involved one at that. It is very obvious that he wants to create a healthy environment for his child by getting along with his ex. \n\nComing from a blended family, you should be more accepting that your husband is making his child, priority one, as it should be. \n\nGoing through the timeline of your relationship, it is clear that you got into this relationship without weighing the pros and cons.\n\nYou need to understand that when you marry a single parent, the child/children will always come first.\n\nYou can't expect your husband to only co-parent for medical emergencies or special occasions. You don't get to dictate that. \n\nAnd it is clear as daylight why does his ex have a problem with you, it is because you got together when the two were barely separated. So I can't really blame her for not wanting you around.", "YTA\n\nYou need to be less insecure bc nothing you can do or \"order\" him to do will ever make you the mother of his child, and she will always come first when it comes to his child and how he wants his childhood to be. \n\nHe could obviously be with her if he wanted to be so just actually believe that and act accordingly.", "YTA.  You apparently chose to marry a man who has a child with someone else.  You can decide for yourself if you have any sort of contact or share space with his ex...but he CAN'T.", "YTA very jealous and immature.  Do him and his son a favour and break up.  You would make an awful stepmother and will always be jealous of a child.  Moving forward, do not date anyone who has kids", "Sounds like you\u2019re the odd one out. Do with that information what you will, but it is simply a fact.", "He can be a good Dad without spending time with the ex. **HE WANTS TO SPEND THE TIME WITH THEM**. It's time for you to leave this relationship and let them work it out.\n\nBottom line: You're not happy and it's not up to you to change things.", "YTA\n\nI do not think it's a coincidence that OP left off what these other events are. The child is 2. If the child is spending overnights with dad half of the week, it sounds like the parents are a 50/50 shared parenting split or something darn close to that. It looks like dad is killing it as an equal parent and why rock the boat with the ex. Shared parenting has nuance to it, and the new spouse or partner really isn't a party to the shared parenting plan. OP can have an opinion, but OP doesn't innately get a say.\n\nThe child is 2 and benefits from having active parents in their life. When the child is older, setting up the boundaries of each household will be more important so the kid understands their parents are not together. Let's assume one of the \"other events\" was a fall pumpkin patch, and maybe at age 2 this is the first time the child can show how excited they are for it. Why not have both parents enjoy that rather than doing two different pumpkin patches? Just a silly example, but directionally shows my view of this situation.\n\nETA: OP answered in another thread that the events were school shopping and some birthday parties. My feedback still remains the same. The child is 2. When the child is older, IF the parents decide to do separate parties or attend things only on their time, that is up to them.", "YTA and also an idi*t for marrying a man with a child and trying to erase the family that already exists. Yes, it\u2019s still a family if they are divorced since both of them are the CHILDs parents. The child\u2019s feeling always go before jealous adults. \n\nAlso, you probably were the affair partner if it\u2019s only been two years and he is already remarried. Nasty work.", "As a child of divorce it\u2019s sooooo evil of you to ask your husband to not do things with his son and his ex? So the kid never gets to experience events with both of his parents? How selfish can you be.", "YTA - and your comment about these things won't be as frequent,  um noooo. The kid is 2. Birthday parties, school trips, sporting events, school events are just going to more than triple as the kid starts school and does other activities. It's minimal today. So if you are jealous of today, prepare yourself because the time they NEED to spend together will grow. \nAnd I'm assuming when you have a kid together, you are going to ignore the fact he has a child and only \"allow\" time with yours. You need to get over yourself because you are already putting up horrible flags of him choosing you over the 2 yr old child.", "I'm sorry, but YTA.\n\nThis child is only two years old and there are a lot of 'firsts' that are yet still to be had by this child. A responsible and caring dad would not want to miss out on those even if having them meant interacting and experiencing them with an ex.\n\nYou're essentially saying if it's not related to academic or medical topics there shouldn't be any interaction between the two of them and at this stage of this child's life, that's not truly reasonable. I could see if the child were older and more independent, but that's not the case here.\n\nIf you're worried about your ~~bf~~ husband and his ex rekindling something, then you're in the wrong relationship.

There is definitely an insecurity that comes w having a partner who has a child or children with an ex. However if you want a healthy relationship with everyone you have to manage those feelings. While it is important for a child who has parents who are not together to understand that lots of things are separate it is also very hard to parent a child that young and not have ongoing contact or involvement with the other parent. Things may be easier as they get older and more independent but they really do need both parents as involved as they can and want to be as hard as that may be for you. Your husband is also responsible for including you as his wife and supporting you through this as well. This would be a lot easier for everyone if she was accepting of you.

I\u2019m sure she is insecure about you too.", "Leave.", "NTA\n\nYou already have a pretty fair and balanced compromise with him, I mean if his son comes over half the week that's pretty darn great.

It's a tough situation but to me it sounds like you have a good arrangement now and seeing his ex is completely unnecessary", "NTA\n\nFrom what information you've provided you've been very fair and open towards his child and their needs. You're happy for him to attend appointments with her and all the necessary, just not family outings just the three of them. \n\nPre Warning though, most people who describe their ex to be manipulative and the villain are usually '\"the bad guy\" in the situation, and use this tactic to stop you and the ex from communicating with one another. They tend to play both sides in that sense so that you hate one another and he can have his cake and eat it. \n\nHowever, if that isn't the case and he is ignoring your boundaries and fair request then maybe it's time for couples counselling or time for you to decide is this really the partnership you want?", "As a family therapist, you\u2019re not the asshole. If in fact both of the parent are doing their part and are peaceful, then things are already perfect. He wants the best of both worlds by being a family man to both you and his ex.

Of course it is for the best to get along with your ex when you have a kid. But you are not a family anymore. There is usually a good reason people break up - its because they dont want to be together.\n\nThis is absolutely unfair to the future/current partners. It is also unfair to the child because it will get very confusing. He will have a hundred questions about why are his parents not living together when they spend time together all the time.\n\nI would never tolerate this or force this on anyone. And its definitely something your husband should have told you before marrying you. He wants to have a family with one woman and a marriage on the side.", "ESH.

I mean, you\u2019re married to this guy, you\u2019re here to stay, his son lives with you half the time, he\u2019s your step child\u2026 your husbands ex just needs to accept the fact that you\u2019re part of the family and you need to fight for that\u2026 and I\u2019m feeling like the fact you\u2019re not fighting it is maybe an indicator you don\u2019t want his son in your life?\n\nBut also, I feel bad because my brother-in-law is currently in the process of destroying his relationship with an amazing girl because he simply cannot set boundaries with his ex, who happens to be the mother of his son. Like yes, they need to co-parent together, but my BIL\u2019s ex is an extremely controlling, master manipulator, who does not want to be with my BIL, but also doesn\u2019t want him to be with anyone else (even though she\u2019s happy to date whoever the hell she wants to). She says \u201cjump\u201d he says \u201chow high\u201d, and thats the way it\u2019s been for 6 years now and it\u2019s completely destroyed every relationship he\u2019s tried to have since then and prevented him from moving on (even though she is now pregnant with another man\u2019s child, she\u2019s still constantly controlling his life and sabotaging any relationship he tries to have).\n\nAll this to say, setting boundaries and establishing guidelines for appropriate and inappropriate communication is very much part of effective co-parenting and moving forward as a cohesive dual-family. While I feel bad for my BIL, it\u2019s also his fault because he has completely refused to set any boundaries with his ex. She will get whatever she wants out of him at any time, and it rarely has absolutely anything to do with their child\u2026 and that\u2019s on him.\n\nBased on your original post, \u201cmedical and school events\u201d seems like a completely reasonable boundary to me. However, I also don\u2019t see why you\u2019re not fighting for your position in your stepsons life.

The ex, apparently, hates you. You spend half of the week with her child, and yet she doesnt make an effort to know you a little bit. Strange. I would like to know the person who lives with my child.\n\nAt the end of the day, he is a parent first. You will have to trust him until he shows you, you cant (not gonna say it will happen). He will do as he wants, and, honestly, you will always be the \"bad person\" if you make him stay.\n\nThey separated very soon after the kid was born (messy and hard period of time) and he jumped right in a new relationship. Maybe he didnt resolved that relationship as well you both thought. Maybe he feels guilty because his child has two homes. Maybe the ex is pushing him to do more stuff together, maybe she is influencing the kid to ask for the same thing. \n\nThere is one thing you have to talk about: how they will handle holidays like christmas? They will do it together? And you? The ex doesnt want you close, you will spend it alone? And when you two have kids?\n\nAt the end of the day, NTA for feeling the way you feel. But, you have to trust he is doing the best he can. He told you he know the ex is very manipulative. You have to trusy he will see it.

He's establishing you as the outsider. \n\n\nBe prepared.", "NTA \n\nIt is in the child's best interest for parents to get along and when possible show a united front.  This teaches the child that their parents communicate  and minimizes the divide and conquer techniques many kids use when the parents dont communicate or get along well.\n\nYou dont say how long youve been married but with him having a two year old son, it cant have been long.\n\nWere you and your husband involved before his divorce and that is why the ex wants nothing to do with you?\n\nIf so, i would recommend group therapy for the three of you because as long as you are with your husband the child will be a part of your life.  And maybe you will have your own child later, if you dont already, and there may be lots.of times situations force you to be in the presence of the ex and.visa versa. \n\nSo for the good of the child and for your peace of mind, i think you all could benefit from airing out grievances and mapping out boundaries with a professional therapist or.mediator.\n\nUnless youve seen you husband and his ex interacting it it would be hard to judge whether you are wrong to want him not to spend time with his ex and son together.  Without knowing whether you were involved with him before his divorce its hard to judge the ex's possible reasons for wanting.nothing to do with you.\n\nBecause in my experience, most mothers of young kids very much want to meet and get.to know the new wife/GF who will be spending lots of time with her child.  And the fact that she doesnt leads me to think theres at least a possibility that you were a cause of disharmony in their marriage.  \n\nBut in any case, all the adults should do everything possible to work things out so you can be cordial, if not friendly with one another for the sake of the child.  They can sense tension and with the child only being 2 there is a long road ahead.", "NTA. He\u2019s your husband now. That ship with his ex has sailed. There\u2019s nothing jealous about it.

Just because the ex doesn't like or accept you doesn't mean that you get to punish their kid for it. Quite frankly, if you are actively trying to prevent him from being the best dad he can be, she probably has good reason to feel the way she does.\n\nYou are being terribly insecure and jealous, which are among the most detestable traits in any partner, especially when there is a child involved.

Also, sorry for asking but did he moved in with you because he wanted to or because he couldn't afford to pay rent by himself while also paying child support?\n\nWith all that, plus the fact that him, her and their son will always be a family, it's easy to understand why he's behaving like he does. You're NTA for asking for boundaries, but it has the same effect as me asking to the sky to stop the rain. It won't happen. Because he jumped into things without thinking much. And you and the mother of his child let it happen. So he doesn't see why it has to change now.\n\nYou called her his ex-wife, so at least the divorce is done (sounds quick but possible). But I'll still advise you to take a step back emotionally. He seems like the type of guy who wants the better of both worlds. If the divorce is not yet done, really take care of your heart. He won't be the first to leave because it's hard at home and come back when the kid sleeps at night and his ex has more time for him.\n\nYou know him better than I do but, please, protect yourself.", "So the answer is YES you were dating him when he was still married to the ex.", "BS", "Everybody thinks they're actually married but they're not. she's totally misrepresenting the situation to pretend she's in any way his wife or the 'stepmother' of the child in question", "I don't think anyone is a reason for divorce other than the couple. He got with me bc he didn't want to be with her anymore and wants to be with me. They were already separated and living apart.", "Right, the guy left his wife and <6 month old and moved in with this lady, whether she's his new wife or actually still just the new girlfriend. Total mess. If I were the mom of the baby, I'd want nothing to do with this girlfriend either.", "Then why not admit to the affair? I guess you are feeling what the wife felt when he was with you and not her", "And you don\u2019t see why the ex doesn\u2019t want shit to do with you? I sure as fuck wouldn\u2019t, especially since I know he\u2019ll eventually drop the trash he found.", "I must\u2019ve misread. I understood that OP wasn\u2019t given the option to join family events w the ex bc the ex is controlling. This would be wrong bc the OP is the current wife. OPs spouse can be a good father without going on outings alone w his ex.\n\nAlso why add biased details to the story? Do you know for a fact OP is a detriment to the child? Maybe the ex is controlling based on the info given.", "To the state, not to me.", "Jesus you all must have been cheated on to be so aggressive about it. \n\nKudos for perpetuating misogyny.", ">He said he doesn't like to spend too much time with her and when he sees her it reminds him why he left.\n\nDo you believe him on that? Because if you do, you shouldn't have a problem with them spending family time together (in fact, you should welcome it, seems like it only makes him feel better to be with you after that). \n\nIf you don't believe him, then why are you with him?", "> I\u2019ve never seen them interact \n\nOkay that\u2019s VERY weird. You\u2019ve been passing a baby back and forth for a year and a half and your husband has never had a conversation at the door or anything? \n\nHow often have *you* interacted with this woman? You say she doesn\u2019t like you/won\u2019t accept you, but is that stuff *she* said to your face, or stuff your *husband* said?", "I am sorry you don\u2019t leave a pregnant women. Fine separate. you don\u2019t leave. Anything could happen you stay to help your child. Not sure of your parents situation but this lady had an affair it\u2019s so obvious from the comments. Also jumping into one marriage to the next healthy or not is never healthy for kids from that first marriage", "The more she comments the more obvious it becomes", "I see. That sounds like a very difficult situation, because she is within her rights to want to only co-parent with him if she chooses. :(", "She has every right to not want you to have anything to do with her child.", "ESH\n\nShe does have every right to state her boundaries and who she wants around her child. However, the child\u2019s father also has the right to move on and welcome whatever woman he sees fit into his life. If you guys were to get married and have children of your own, there will be no separation there so your boyfriend and his child\u2019s mother need to grow up and come to an agreement. \n\nI can understand her not wanting you to be involved in parenting decisions, the whole \u201cI want no part of her\u201d needs to be nipped in the bud though because if you guys were to progress in your relationship (get married/have kids), then you\u2019re going to continue to be around and it\u2019s going to be worse for the kid if there is a strain with the step mom. \n\nThe only person that matters here is the baby so you also need to get over the fact that you\u2019re not invited to things involving his mother and father. If this is not something you can handle then unfortunately this single father and his dynamic is not for you. I\u2019m not trying to be mean just trying to be honest, I hope you can figure it all out.", "I think that is not a common opinion", "Exactly me with 2 I ordered everything online about shopping with 2 screaming brats no thank you", "What are you talking about. Dad has a relationship with kid. Mom has a relationship with kid. You tell me why Mom & Dad need to spend quality time together with no focus being on the child. Doctors appts. Yep. Toddler classes. Yep. Day care meetings. Yep. Hanging out with ex\u2019s & her family at a family birthday party while kid takes a nap \u2026 No. What\u2019s the point? Showing other people they both love their kid? They are not a couple. \n\nThe guy wants to raise his kid and hang out with his ex. That\u2019s great but his current wife should be okay with the plan. She\u2019s not. He doesn\u2019t care. There\u2019s the problem.", "He should have \u2018got with you\u2019 because he wanted to *be with you*\u2026.not \u2018he got with me because he didn\u2019t want to be with her anymore\u2019.\n\nThe fact that you actually typed that out, with 0 awareness of how problematic it is, is nuts.", "You said in another comment that they were separated for 2 months. Yet you say here that the kid was 6 mos old and you\u2019ve been with him for a year and a half. So which is it?", "\u201cHe got with me bc he didn\u2019t want to be with her anymore and wants to be with me\u201d kind of contradicts what you\u2019re saying about you not being the reason.", "this is incredibly niave", "I never said OP was a detriment to the child. What I\u2019m saying is based on the timeline that\u2019s implied by the child\u2019s age, there\u2019s a possibility that the child\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t like OP for a reason. The fact that OP and her husband are already married even though he had a baby with another woman\u2019s two years ago suggests that there might have been some overlap between his relationships with the two women.", "You might have a valid argument if you had been together for five years or more but you\u2019ve been with him less than two years. You\u2019re just his gf. If you don\u2019t like how things are, you can just walk away. In marriage or a long term partnership, you can\u2019t do that. You would have to slowly dissolve the life you built together which is what your partner did with his ex wife. You can\u2019t dictate the terms of a coparenting relationship that you\u2019re not officially a part of.", "Words have meanings assigned to them, like husband means 'a male partner in marriage' or 'a married man'.", "Nope, never cheated on. Lol for pulling out the misogyny card when people don't agree with you", "Never cheated and never cheated on and  I am a women. Just seen the damage to kids. Your boyfriends poor son", "OP has a responsibility towards his child just as much as the child\u2019s mother does, naturally, that means they are going to have to put up with one another during events or visits. You and OP don\u2019t want him to attend his own child\u2019s fucking birthday? It\u2019s not about spending time with mom or showing other people anything, ITS ABOUT QUALITY TIME WITH THE FUCKING KID!!!! Not about the other horseshit excuses you came up with.\n\nAnd let\u2019s make one things crystal clear. He *shouldn\u2019t* care if OP is cool with the plan because does not get a say. Period. That is the reality when you date someone with a child, the child is and will always be a priority over you. Only a real asshole would prefer the new partner over the kid, which should in all honesty be a red flag. \n\nIf you want to date someone with a kid you need to accept that reality or date someone you\u2019re actually compatible with.", "That conflict is really irrelevant if all the adults actually want a healthy environment for their kids. \n\nThey could work it out and coparent together instead of validating OPs need to split personal time between his wife and former partner. The latter is really not a healthy dynamic for all parties involved, it only benefits some people.", "Then don\u2019t get married if you don\u2019t want to hear another person\u2019s perspective about how to work together & share your life together.", "It is relevant. If this coparenting dynamic was created out of betrayal or deceit on the part of one of more of the three adults, it would explain what\u2019s going here. Depending on the role OP played in creating this dynamic, she might need to show some humility by taking a step back and letting her husband and his ex coparent in a way that works for them.", "True. OP\u2019s husband is a real fool for marrying someone whose perspective encourages neglecting the kid in favor of them.", "The OP is the spouse, she doesn\u2019t have to step back to let her spouse and his ex partner work on their relationship. Especially bc all the spouse claims he\u2019s trying to do is be there for his children. He can do that without isolating his wife. \n\nWhether infidelity is a factor or not is irrelevant if the adults want a healthy dynamic for the kids. If the spouse and his ex can\u2019t be innovative and problem solve that\u2019s on them, but let\u2019s not gaslight OP into thinking this is normal or respectful of her marriage."]}
