My husband\u2019s niece, Jessica (19F) stays at our place 3-4 days a week because she goes to university close to our place. When she\u2019s not here she goes back to stay with her mom (my SIL).\n\nJessica doesn\u2019t pay rent or do house chores, although her mom sometimes gives us about $100 to help with bills just whenever she can.\n\nOnto the problem. So my house is pretty noisy. My daughter would cry if she\u2019s not psychically on me. Most of the time I would always carry her around so she wouldn\u2019t cry. But on the daily whenever I have to bathe my son, I would leave her in her crib and she would scream cry like the world is ending. This usually happens about 15-20 minutes a day. And she\u2019s safe, she just doesn\u2019t like not being with me. Once I pick her up she would stop crying instantly.\n\nOn top of that my son would throw tantrums pretty often. At home, I just ignore him and let him screech scream and trash around. To be fair, my son\u2019s scream would pierce your ears. Sometimes I have to wear noise cancelling headphones and cover my daughter\u2019s ears while he\u2019s throwing tantrums. And he does it a lot, like 3-4 times a week, sometimes it happens twice a day. He usually would calm down after an hour, the longest was two hours.\n\nThere\u2019s one particular night when Jessica was at the kitchen washing her dishes, and my son was at the living room just beside the kitchen. He was throwing a really bad tantrum because I wanted him to say \u201cplease\u201d. If this is a public space or other people\u2019s house I would turn on youtube and he would calm down right away. But because we\u2019re at home, I thought he should learn to navigate his big feelings without youtube.\n\nHe screamed, screeched, thrashed around like a mad man, while I was at the dining table eating my dinner, just a couple steps away from him. Sometimes he took rests from screaming and I gave him water, but once he started screaming again I left him again and back to continuing my dinner. When he stops screaming I would ask if he\u2019s done, then I\u2019d hold his hand and say something like \u201cRepeat after me: Mom open the box please,\u201d but if he starts screaming again I would leave again. This continued for about an hour an a half.\n\nJessice secretly recorded some of it (me calmly eating while watching my son screeching), and she sent it to her family group chat that I am not a part of. She didn\u2019t say anything to me\u2014we typically pretend the other doesn\u2019t exist. She also didn\u2019t say anything when sending the video.\n\nMy husband was offended by her sending the video as if she was ratting me out. But other SIL said maybe I should do something to calm my kids when they\u2019re clearly in distress. She knows it happens a lot, which means Jessica had said something to them before.\n\nThey\u2019re now fighting. Other family members chose not to get involved. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong but AITA for ignoring my kid\u2019s tantrums?\n\nEdit:\nThank you everyone, all the the NTAs and the YTAs give me insights and new perspectives. I also received some great tips I\u2019ll start implementing soon. I will now stop responding to comments and log out of this throwaway account.

So now he just thinks that he\u2019s got to hold out for longer before you resort to YouTube to reward his tantrums but doesn\u2019t understand that option is off the table.\n\nIt\u2019s also very likely, since he\u2019s of an age where kids start developing the ability to feel jealousy, that he is still adjusting to having a new sibling in the home and is seeking attention because of that and exaggerating his bad behaviour for that reason - so he probably needs for you to arrange some one on one time without his sister there where you are doing something fun rather than having her present and in your arms or having to do some necessity like his bath during the only time he gets with you.\n\nThat isn\u2019t an asshole situation but is something to bear in mind.\n\nBut your niece is of an age where if she can see you struggling she should be offering to hold the baby for a half hour while she watches tv or something to help you get that time with your son, and she should be talking to you about it if she\u2019s having difficulty dealing with the noise rather than just telling tales to family and causing further disruption.

Tantrums lasting 1-2 hours are not developmentally appropriate for a neurotypical child of any age. Most children  are able to self regulate and calm themselves down especially with help from parents. I highly suggest to take your son in to be evaluated for autism. This is coming from someone who works with kids with ASD. Also, you are dealing with his tantrums partially right. You are promoting functional communication and not accepting screams as a way to communicate. That\u2019s good. But what isn\u2019t good is you ignoring him. It\u2019s obvious he cannot self regulate, he needs more help. When he starts throwing a tantrum over something you are going to get down on the floor on his level, and model coping skills. Model deep breathing, model using a sensory toy. Ask him if he wants a hug, squeezes. Most importantly, just be there. Just sit there with him, and let him know that YOU are his safe space. Ignoring tantrums like this tells your child that he is not safe to express his feeling with you. It has major affects on them as adults trying to communicate and express their feelings with others. You might have to sit there on the ground with him for 30 minutes. But that\u2019s what it takes. I know this is hard but you need to start doing more to help your son. He is struggling in a way that is not developmentally normal.", "NTA. But\u2026.your techniques with ignoring your kid wont work.

So I know this isn\u2019t coming from a place of neglect - it\u2019s what we grew up with and have had engrained in us. \n\nBut there is a lot of research now that shows ignoring tantrums does not teach kids to navigate their feelings, it teaches them that their feelings don\u2019t matter and should be hidden and ignored.

It can be innocent, but giving the general tone you have toward the kid in your post, I'm thinking you say it in an exasperated tone. Which is bad.) \n\nIt's absolutely understandable that you need a break. It's totally fine to let him rage himself out for a couple of minutes while you leave the room and calm down so you don't take your anger out on him. That's showcasing self care that he can learn to mimic (if explained).\n\nIt's not okay to expect a THREE YEAR OLD to have the emotional capacities of a grown up. They are literally still learning how to human. They have no idea how to deal with their emotions. They don't even know what their emotions are or why they are feeling what they are feeling. Your job, as the parent, is to teach them how to regulate. YOU have to figure out what the problem is, and help the kid find a solution.\n\nBecause sweetheart, the problem isn't that he doesn't get what he wants. It's that his mother ignores him for hours when he's overwhelmed. It's that his mother gets angry at him for having emotions and not doing what she wants when she wants him to. Maybe he's even jealous he doesn't have your attention 24/7 anymore. (But the cure for that jealousy isn't to give him no attention. That just makes the problem worse.)\n\nLook. I have a three year old too. She has autism. I know tantrums. I sometimes wish I could get noise canceling headphones to ignore her screams. I sometimes have to leave the room she's screaming in to calm down myself. But I'm a decent human being who can't stand a child crying without comfort for more than 10 minutes. It's sometimes a real search to find what will calm her down (without giving into her unreasonable demands like only eating candy or me fixing the bowl she just shattered beyond repair) but I work with her to find what works.  And when she's calm, and wont get triggered again, we have a chat about why she got so sad and what we can do in the future. \n\nAnd guess what? She has less tantrums. She self regulates better. The tantrums she does have last way shorter than before we started working on her self regulation. \n\nIgnoring a problem *never* makes it go away. It only makes it worse. You're ignoring your child. You're making him worse.\n\n(This is all based on what you said in your post. I don't know the details of your life. Maybe your child has a bigger problem making it so that nothing helps.

It seems harsh but it\u2019s how you work to connect appropriate behavior and inappropriate behavior. It will work over the long run, it\u2019s just a tough age and it depends on the severity of the delay/disability. Idk if OP has had the oldest diagnosed but it sounds very similar to a disruptive behavior disorder", ">He screamed, screeched, thrashed around like a mad man, while I was at the dining table eating my dinner, just a couple steps away from him. Sometimes he took rests from screaming and I gave him water, but once he started screaming again I left him again and back to continuing my dinner. When he stops screaming I would ask if he\u2019s done, then I\u2019d hold his hand and say something like \u201cRepeat after me: Mom open the box please,\u201d but if he starts screaming again I would leave again. This continued for about an hour an a half.\n\nThis is disengaging, not ignoring. \n\nIf a child can take a break for a drink and to catch their breath then they are safe and cared for. \n\nThe kid's clearly having a difficult time, but the mother was attentive and caring, without feeding into the behavior.", ">But other SIL said maybe I should do something to calm my kids when they\u2019re clearly in distress.\n\nFrom the OP. \n\nI don't disagree with you. My language was sloppy, because distress describes an emotional state, and also describes a behavioral state. \n\nThe external appearance of distress to a person who is not the parent of the child is not an appropriate way to judge how their parent should respond, as they are very unlikely to have a clear insight into the child's actual emotional state. \n\nMy experience is that kids can have almost any combination of emotion and behaviour. One of mine would laugh hysterically when she was distressed: in a way that to someone looking on would appear as though she was genuinely having a whale of a time. \n\nAt three, it's pretty tough. An hour long tantrum a 3-5 times a week is more than I ever dealt with, but not far off. In this case, it's beyond the scope to speculate how acceptable this frequency of emotional dysregulation is.  If the kid is actually experiencing emotional distress for that length of time and in that frequency it seems pretty rough for all involved. Except in the OP they say that the kid would take breaks for a drink, which is not something a truly continually distressed child can do.\n\nMy comment was really around the response, which seemed to me to be appropriately neutral given the circumstance.", "My mom/dad's solution was: \n\nAt home- pretty much what you're doing \n\nIn public- go home. Tantrums in public resulted in immediate going home. \n\nWe quickly learned that tantrum= no fun. And that it didn't matter where we were, it wasn't going to work. It sucked for her, having to leave a full cart of groceries or something on occasion, but it didn't happen much after the first few times.", "Having dealt with this myself, although not as extreme, what to do is if he starts to throw a tantrum, you leave. Take him out, put him in the car, and go home. He's getting attention, but it's not the attention he wants.  I realize that sometimes this plan isn't an option, but you'll have to try to plan for those. Such as, if a needed doctor's appointment. You might have to grind those out. If it is jealousy over his sister, then maybe only do those necessary trips when you can have your partner or someone else be in charge of the baby. Hopefully when she's sleeping if she's still in the \"have to be physically on Mom\" thing. Which I've also gone through, with a kid who refused to be in any kind of baby wrap or carrier, I had to hold her in my arms. With luck, your son will figure this out fairly quickly, but you're going to need help through this stretch. Such as, someone else doing the shopping if your son always melts down and you have to go home. Or order food online and get it delivered. \n\nThe good news is that all of this does pass.", "Honestly you\u2019re doing everything right. I would HIGHLY recommend getting a referral to your local children\u2019s hospital\u2019s behavioral unit and get an evaluation done by a developmental pediatrician. We had my son\u2019s done before he turned 4 because he was having a lot of behavioral issues on top of his speech delays and showed mild ASD signs. Our team is amazing and we were hooked up with great resources and parenting group classes on how to work with kids with these types of behavioral issues. Even they recommend when you\u2019re out in public you gotta do what you gotta do, when you\u2019re at home, that\u2019s when the work gets done. That being said, when they do behave correctly in public you praise and when they don\u2019t you still tell them no we don\u2019t do that and redirect - if it\u2019s you tube it\u2019s you tube but you redirect so everyone else doesn\u2019t have to deal with your child.", "If it helps, my almost 3 year old had a screaming melt down at Target yesterday when it was time to leave.

She had just as much right to be there as anyone else.", "You are doing it exactly right. Have faith in yourself, your kids have faith in you.", "Trust me, you can teach your kids to say \"please\" and \"thank you\" just by modeling it yourself and praising the kids whenever they get it right.

But ever since then, I've had absolutely very little sense of shame and embarrassment in public so I let my daughter throw her tornado tantrums in public (I don't let her touch anything except herself) and remove her from where the people are. But when we are at home it's so much easier to give in and let her watch TV so I can recharge", "You seem like a caring mom, and you work hard for your kid.

It's okay to diffuse the situation in public because u have a right to enjoy yourself when out. My son is allowed to watch cocomelon in restaurants.  I don't want to pay to eat and watch a meltdown outside so we justndo what gets him happy. We are very strict at home too. Except when kid is sick.

It sounds like you are going a good job navigating toddler behaviors. My suggestion is to remove the YouTube. Screen addiction is a huge thing and I think we are going to learn how much worse it is. I don\u2019t think it will solve all normal toddler behaviors but  your sentence where he calmed down right away after YT is what struck that cord with me. He may be addicted to his screen and his tantrum is the reaction/withdrawal. There is conversation happening around this, especially after that student attacked the teacher after she removed his iPad. Did I let my kids watch videos? Yes but even 15 years ago it was different from today. Do I wish I hadn\u2019t? Absolutely. Kids are coming to school with less everything: social skills, attention span, ability to retain information, beginning reading and special awareness.

It is a very empty word with little obvious communicative value for children who develop social communication skills differently to what we might expect. Was the sentence length you modelled language he can typically use when he is motivated?\n\nAnother consequence that might be more regulating is that he can choose something else. You can always remind him here are other toys, but that he needs to ask for help with the box.", "I'm autistic. Speaking from my own experience, a lot of meltdowns would have been avoided if my parents didn't turn everything into a power struggle.  \n\"Forcing\" your child to say please is you trying to assert your power. It's not necessary. You know what is upsetting him, you know that he's getting frustrated, you know that the more frustrated he gets the less he can self regulate, & you know what will calm him down. But \"winning\" is more important to you.    \nThe interaction should have gone \"mom, open this box\", \"Sure. While I'm doing that, let's practice our manners. We always say please and thank you when we ask for help. Can you help mommy open this box, please? Thank you so much for your help.\" And then move on.

Obviously it's not your fault (I can't imagine laughing at someone who went out of their way to learn my language), but if she was young enough, she might have a core memory of shame and humiliation that she associates with you. Again, not your fault in any way; if she does, she's an adult now and it's her responsibility to work through that and figure out how to interact with you with basic courtesy. Pretending you don't exist while she's in *your* home is not that. Secretly filming you instead of having an actual conversation isn't it, either.", "That's very odd.

Does he even understand the expectation or why it\u2019s there? Has he had a chance to practice this expectation at a time when he\u2019s not so overwhelmed?\n\nIf this is a one off and he normally says please just fine, what is the harm in just going: \u201cWhoa, I can see you\u2019re having a hard time. You really want this box opened now.\u201d We might not always know why they are having a hard time, but we also shouldn\u2019t require people to \u2018prove\u2019 they need help. I pick up the slack for my husband, my family, my friends if they\u2019re struggling. Surely, I can do it for a 3 year old who isn\u2019t nearly as capable. At this point, my focus is in empathy/safety and getting curious about what they\u2019re finding so stressful they can\u2019t meet expectations they usually do.\n\n90% of behavior management should be proactive. Meltdowns, whining, complaints, hitting, etc are signals that a child is struggling meeting expectations. If you change your focus to what expectations are they struggling to meet and why, you don\u2019t have to figure out the magic recipe for ending a tantrum, because you can instead set up the environment or your instructions/requests/teachings so that children can be successful from the start. Self-Reg by Stuart Shanker and Raising Human Beings by Ross Greene are good resources for this.\n\nA real life example: with my oldest autistic/adhd then-3 year old, no language delay, I\u2019d pull up to the grocery store and say, \u2018Last time we were here, you had a hard time (sticking with me, only putting things in the cart with permission, not running into people). I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll happen again today.\u2019 We\u2019d have a chat about what was hard about that expectation, why the expectation was important, and create a realistic plan for our visit to address that one concern. I\u2019d praise her going through the store, remind her of the plan as needed, and I\u2019d ignore/redirect misbehavior not related to our focus for the day. When we left, I\u2019d note the biggest problem to discuss before the next trip. Eventually, we had gone through all the problem issues and she knew the expectations of grocery store shopping. She went from meltdowns so bad I\u2019d abandon grocery carts to being a helpful assistant.\n\n(And, this is for a child who has adhd so severe I was told at 5 that, if I didn\u2019t medicate her, she\u2019d develop delays in all areas of development as she simply couldn\u2019t pay attention to anything long enough to learn even in a one-on-one environment.)\n\nMy middle son, who\u2019s been raised with the same principals, regularly has teacher meetings where I\u2019m told they can\u2019t recall ever having to tell him anything twice because he\u2019s always on task and never breaks rules.

He has a speech therapist that will come work with him weekly at his daycare.  It has helped, but he is still behind the other kids.\n\nAnyway, before therapy started, he would get extremely frustrated and upset (unable to communicate), throwing some bad tantrums.  None that lasted hours though, maybe 20 minutes tops.  We would ignore them when he was having them.

However, it's possible that you might be setting the bar too high for him at the moment, or perhaps trying to teach him in non-ideal contexts (such as when he's stressed/overwhelmed). Until he's ready to further his use of words, it might help to accept other ways of communicating for the time being, as others have suggested. Remember that all behaviour is communication - when he screams, consider what might he be trying to communicate? Then you can model the words for him (without expecting him to repeat it himself - this is where the power struggle might be an issue).
