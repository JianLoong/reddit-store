My husband\u2019s niece, Jessica (19F) stays at our place 3-4 days a week because she goes to university close to our place. When she\u2019s not here she goes back to stay with her mom (my SIL).\n\nJessica doesn\u2019t pay rent or do house chores, although her mom sometimes gives us about $100 to help with bills just whenever she can.\n\nOnto the problem. So my house is pretty noisy. My daughter would cry if she\u2019s not psychically on me. Most of the time I would always carry her around so she wouldn\u2019t cry. But on the daily whenever I have to bathe my son, I would leave her in her crib and she would scream cry like the world is ending. This usually happens about 15-20 minutes a day. And she\u2019s safe, she just doesn\u2019t like not being with me. Once I pick her up she would stop crying instantly.\n\nOn top of that my son would throw tantrums pretty often. At home, I just ignore him and let him screech scream and trash around. To be fair, my son\u2019s scream would pierce your ears. Sometimes I have to wear noise cancelling headphones and cover my daughter\u2019s ears while he\u2019s throwing tantrums. And he does it a lot, like 3-4 times a week, sometimes it happens twice a day. He usually would calm down after an hour, the longest was two hours.\n\nThere\u2019s one particular night when Jessica was at the kitchen washing her dishes, and my son was at the living room just beside the kitchen. He was throwing a really bad tantrum because I wanted him to say \u201cplease\u201d. If this is a public space or other people\u2019s house I would turn on youtube and he would calm down right away. But because we\u2019re at home, I thought he should learn to navigate his big feelings without youtube.\n\nHe screamed, screeched, thrashed around like a mad man, while I was at the dining table eating my dinner, just a couple steps away from him. Sometimes he took rests from screaming and I gave him water, but once he started screaming again I left him again and back to continuing my dinner. When he stops screaming I would ask if he\u2019s done, then I\u2019d hold his hand and say something like \u201cRepeat after me: Mom open the box please,\u201d but if he starts screaming again I would leave again. This continued for about an hour an a half.\n\nJessice secretly recorded some of it (me calmly eating while watching my son screeching), and she sent it to her family group chat that I am not a part of. She didn\u2019t say anything to me\u2014we typically pretend the other doesn\u2019t exist. She also didn\u2019t say anything when sending the video.\n\nMy husband was offended by her sending the video as if she was ratting me out. But other SIL said maybe I should do something to calm my kids when they\u2019re clearly in distress. She knows it happens a lot, which means Jessica had said something to them before.\n\nThey\u2019re now fighting. Other family members chose not to get involved.

So now he just thinks that he\u2019s got to hold out for longer before you resort to YouTube to reward his tantrums but doesn\u2019t understand that option is off the table.\n\nIt\u2019s also very likely, since he\u2019s of an age where kids start developing the ability to feel jealousy, that he is still adjusting to having a new sibling in the home and is seeking attention because of that and exaggerating his bad behaviour for that reason - so he probably needs for you to arrange some one on one time without his sister there where you are doing something fun rather than having her present and in your arms or having to do some necessity like his bath during the only time he gets with you.\n\nThat isn\u2019t an asshole situation but is something to bear in mind.\n\nBut your niece is of an age where if she can see you struggling she should be offering to hold the baby for a half hour while she watches tv or something to help you get that time with your son, and she should be talking to you about it if she\u2019s having difficulty dealing with the noise rather than just telling tales to family and causing further disruption.

Tantrums lasting 1-2 hours are not developmentally appropriate for a neurotypical child of any age. Most children  are able to self regulate and calm themselves down especially with help from parents. I highly suggest to take your son in to be evaluated for autism. This is coming from someone who works with kids with ASD. Also, you are dealing with his tantrums partially right. You are promoting functional communication and not accepting screams as a way to communicate. That\u2019s good. But what isn\u2019t good is you ignoring him. It\u2019s obvious he cannot self regulate, he needs more help. When he starts throwing a tantrum over something you are going to get down on the floor on his level, and model coping skills. Model deep breathing, model using a sensory toy. Ask him if he wants a hug, squeezes. Most importantly, just be there. Just sit there with him, and let him know that YOU are his safe space. Ignoring tantrums like this tells your child that he is not safe to express his feeling with you. It has major affects on them as adults trying to communicate and express their feelings with others. You might have to sit there on the ground with him for 30 minutes. But that\u2019s what it takes. I know this is hard but you need to start doing more to help your son. He is struggling in a way that is not developmentally normal.", "NTA. But\u2026.your techniques with ignoring your kid wont work.

So I know this isn\u2019t coming from a place of neglect - it\u2019s what we grew up with and have had engrained in us. \n\nBut there is a lot of research now that shows ignoring tantrums does not teach kids to navigate their feelings, it teaches them that their feelings don\u2019t matter and should be hidden and ignored.

Also waiting until the tantrum starts to decide it's a good time to \"let the big feelings be communicated\" just enforces that the kid has to scream and cry to be listened to. It's negative reinforcement all the way down. Yeah, sometimes kids are gonna scream and throw fits because they get frustrated, but it should not be happening for hours every single day??", "When you have more than one child you occasionally have to leave one child cry to tend to the other child. OP said baby was safe , dry and fed but wanted held. Other child needs attention and hygiene, you can\u2019t ignore a 3 year old to hold a needy 6 month old 24/7. Sometimes you put the baby down somewhere safe and let it cry while other child gets the attention it needs.  You are comparing a newborn crying to fed with a tended to infant that wants held, that\u2019s comparing apples and oranges.  If you want your child never to cry don\u2019t have another child because other child will need attention too.", "Sometimes it's better for the child to give them a little slap instead of letting them cry for hours", "When my son threw a tantrum in public I would just stand calmly beside him and tell everyone looking how healthy his lungs were with a big smile on my face. I learned early on if I tried to placate him it just fed into the tantrum and made him worse. As he got older I would ask him if that kind of behaviour has ever got him what he wants and why he thinks it would work now, that usually stopped him in his tracks \ud83d\ude06 as he grew he realised the only way he got what he wanted was to behave and he may nit get it straight away but he would get it later", "HAHAHA I love the image of a queen watching a dog poop! Thank you, it made me chuckle", "Hey millennial dads too! Breaking the cycle!", "Yes!! There are a tons of different ones. I also like \u201cpuppy breaths\u201d where you take a big breath in and then pant like a puppy out. Also volcano breaths- breath in while raising your arms in an arc above your head, and breath out as your arms explode away. Making it fun for the kids is important.", "Got it. Thank you very much!", "I actually have dealt with these type of children before, so by your definition, I can judge. It's not shaming someone by not immediately jumping to the conclusion they are doing their best.", "Thank you for your insight! I\u2019ve never thought of teaching him how to breathe when he\u2019s calm, honestly now that I know I can do that I just feel so silly. I will definitely start teaching it every morning.\n\nAbout baby sign language, I\u2019ll look into it, thanks for the idea!", "Oh no \ud83e\udd72\nMay I ask when didnit get better for you? And yes, actually I have a test for him scheduled for next month.", "Talked to doctor yes since he was 1,5y.o. And another talk with doctor is scheduled next month.", "Deep breathing exercises should be taught when kid is calm???????? HOLY SHIT that makes sense so much why did I never thought of that?????! All this time I would only tell him to breathe when he\u2019s crying\ud83d\udc80 \n\nGood grief. Alright I\u2019ll start deep breathing exercise every morning. Thank you for your comment, really. And no I\u2019m not on TikTok but maybe I can find some things on instagram.", "I mean, you based your judgement off parenting advice and are being asked to elaborate.", "You offered some, incomplete, advice. \n\nFinish it up: 'ignoring your kids tantrum isn't helping: instead you should...'", "This is wild. \n\nI  have a 3 and a 5 year old. \n\nThey absolutely know what please means, they know how to ask politely, they know how to beg, they know how to scream and shout for what they want. \n\nAll sorts of things can lead to a tantrum, but a child escalating demands to get what they want needs to be treated carefully. In school, nursery, anywhere, this type of escalation is going to end poorly for the child - from teachers and from friends. \n\nIgnoring, or not engaging with a tantruming child is not a punishment.", "He\u2019s not being punished, ffs.", "One thing I found to work too is adding, \"I can see you are frustrated. It's okay to be frustrated. But I will not talk until you calm down and use your words\" \nAnd then stick to it. Repeat the sentence a single time if needed. \n\nOne of my kids really took terrible 3 seriously. And was advice I got from their kindergarten teachers.", "Yikes", "If she can't navigate creating a basic push notification then that's her problem!", "Exactly. People just assess the priority of needs and act accordingly.", "Sure, but saying \"no child should ever cry\" is just stupid.", "Ah yes - you would rather hit the kid then just let them process their emotions. Nice \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Also I 100% agree with the comment suggesting you teach your child coping skills while he is calm! \nThis article has lots of fun deep breathing exercises for kids:\n\nhttps://www.moshikids.com/articles/deep-breathing-exercises-for-kids/", "Not going to engage in an argument with you about a struggling mother who is trying to help her son through very difficult emotions. Goodbye.", "You are thoroughly in the thick of things! It's so much easier for people at a distance to have ideas than it is when you're in the middle of it - believe me I have had a screaming child next to me and completely forgotten all the strategies I know work.\n\nGood luck!!", "My son started exhibiting age-inappropriate behavior at his daycare when he was about 3. He would have full on meltdowns and would sometimes need to be physically restrained (gently) to keep him from hurting himself or someone else. \n\nMy state, for all its faults, has a good early intervention program. We were able to get him tested, and he has severe ADHD, an Impulse Control Disorder, and Social-Emotional Disregulation. \n\nEven with an IEP and services the meltdowns continued til he was at least 5. After COVID lockdowns ended he was able to join a special program at the public school. He\u2019s made huge strides. He\u2019s just about 9 now, and they\u2019re moving him to a less restrictive environment next year.\n\nLong-winded, I know, but my point is that it can and will get better. Get him tested and see what services are available to help. In many places it\u2019s possible to get an IEP in place for kids as young as 3. Routine can also be extremely useful. \n\nIf you are doing everything you can to find out what\u2019s going on with him and how to help him, don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you\u2019re a bad parent. It\u2019s hard, and can be painful and frustrating. There is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to parenting. You know your son better than anyone else does. You can do this.", "You're doing a great job. I have an autistic child and boy were his tantrums epic. There was once a 90 minute tantrum because he didn't want dinosaur cookies, so I didn't give him dinosaur cookies. Then I reoffered the dinosaur cookies which prompted another explosion. My mum once said to me \"a mother's place is in the wrong\" and given that EVERYBODY has an opinion on parenting - having been parented themselves as a child - we will never please everyone.\n\nIn terms of your niece. You sit her down with your husband there and present a united front, explain that what she did was unacceptable and a real slap in the face given how much of a favour you're doing for her, and that if she ever does that again, she's out. I would also point out that you are awaiting assessment for developmental conditions at the moment and that this way of dealing with the issue is the one that works best.", "As I got older, it got better because I understood more, but I was a little hellion until I was almost 7 (I\u2019m in my 30s now).\n\nI ended up staying with one of my aunts during that summer and she spent a month just writing down things with a date and time stamp (annotated food, interactions, what media I was consuming, etc) to see if she could find a pattern and she *did*. The biggest triggers for me were artificial sugar and a specific red dye commonly found in candy like twizzlers or fruit punch (apparently it was 10 minutes on the dot after consuming those that I\u2019d freak out). Once those were eliminated, my emotions became much more manageable. \n\nThere may be something that\u2019s setting off your son that\u2019s that simple or it might be that he just feels deeply and is having trouble navigating that. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve already taken the steps to get him evaluated. :)", "I think that\u2019s a good idea as this is out of range for a child his age.", "Yes he sounds neurodivergent for sure. The sooner you get dx the sooner you can start treatment. Your handling of the tantrums is spot on for ASD and adhd. Try reading Raising Your Spirited Child.", "Sometimes the obvious answer isn\u2019t obvious at all, and you\u2019re at the stage where parenting is a lot of trying to hold an anvil while swimming. Some days it\u2019s all you can do to keep your head above water enough to breathe. Please don\u2019t be hard on yourself for this.", "Thank you for the advice. I do that too, but I repeat it multiple times. Is there a reason we should just repeat it once?", "It stops them from crying and teaches them their behaviour is wrong", "I\u2019m saving this. Thank you so much!", "Okay, good day.", "WOW your aunt did God\u2019s work, she\u2019s awesome. I\u2019ll keep that in mind and try to see if there\u2019s a pattern. Thank you for sharing!", "Of course, you can say it more than once if it's a longer lasting tantrum to show you acknowledge their feelings, etc. \n\nBut I was told to keep it at a minimum, or with some time between saying it, because if I use the sentence again and again, it can feel like they are given attention. So, it might prolong the tantrum to get more attention. \n\nAll kids are, of course, different, but over a bit of time, my kid found out I'll acknowledge them, remind them I don't respond to the screaming. And when they calmed down, there were cuddles, and we would talk it through after. And reassurance, yes, I love them no matter what, and big feelings can be hard.\nAnd now that they are some years out of the terrible 3. It's minimal with the tantrums. \n\nHang in there. You'll find a way that works for you. \nIt won't last forever. It will just take some time for them to learn and navigate through their feelings. Even if it doesn't feel like that.", "This is literally untrue, from a child development standpoint - a toddler does not know why you hit them. If they stop the behavior, it\u2019s because they\u2019re afraid, not because they *know* it\u2019s wrong. At least OP doesn\u2019t have to worry about her kid being scared of her.", "I'll teach them their behavior is wrong, by using wrong behavior.", "She is an awesome lady; I hope this helps!", "I see, okay. Thank you for the advice and kind words. I\u2019ll keep it in mind.", "It makes sure her kid repects her", "Respect is not the same thing as fear, not by a long shot. Again, a toddler does not understand *respect*, they understand fear, and being afraid of being hurt - and I\u2019m glad OP would rather try this method than simply hitting their kid.", "Fear* your children will fear you. That is not respect.", "My mother always beat me if my behaviour  was out of order I quickly learnt right from wrong and would be very well behaved in public"]}
