My husband\u2019s niece, Jessica (19F) stays at our place 3-4 days a week because she goes to university close to our place. When she\u2019s not here she goes back to stay with her mom (my SIL).\n\nJessica doesn\u2019t pay rent or do house chores, although her mom sometimes gives us about $100 to help with bills just whenever she can.\n\nOnto the problem. So my house is pretty noisy. My daughter would cry if she\u2019s not psychically on me. Most of the time I would always carry her around so she wouldn\u2019t cry. But on the daily whenever I have to bathe my son, I would leave her in her crib and she would scream cry like the world is ending. This usually happens about 15-20 minutes a day. And she\u2019s safe, she just doesn\u2019t like not being with me. Once I pick her up she would stop crying instantly.\n\nOn top of that my son would throw tantrums pretty often. At home, I just ignore him and let him screech scream and trash around. To be fair, my son\u2019s scream would pierce your ears. Sometimes I have to wear noise cancelling headphones and cover my daughter\u2019s ears while he\u2019s throwing tantrums. And he does it a lot, like 3-4 times a week, sometimes it happens twice a day. He usually would calm down after an hour, the longest was two hours.\n\nThere\u2019s one particular night when Jessica was at the kitchen washing her dishes, and my son was at the living room just beside the kitchen. He was throwing a really bad tantrum because I wanted him to say \u201cplease\u201d. If this is a public space or other people\u2019s house I would turn on youtube and he would calm down right away. But because we\u2019re at home, I thought he should learn to navigate his big feelings without youtube.\n\nHe screamed, screeched, thrashed around like a mad man, while I was at the dining table eating my dinner, just a couple steps away from him. Sometimes he took rests from screaming and I gave him water, but once he started screaming again I left him again and back to continuing my dinner. When he stops screaming I would ask if he\u2019s done, then I\u2019d hold his hand and say something like \u201cRepeat after me: Mom open the box please,\u201d but if he starts screaming again I would leave again. This continued for about an hour an a half.\n\nJessice secretly recorded some of it (me calmly eating while watching my son screeching), and she sent it to her family group chat that I am not a part of. She didn\u2019t say anything to me\u2014we typically pretend the other doesn\u2019t exist. She also didn\u2019t say anything when sending the video.\n\nMy husband was offended by her sending the video as if she was ratting me out. But other SIL said maybe I should do something to calm my kids when they\u2019re clearly in distress. She knows it happens a lot, which means Jessica had said something to them before.\n\nThey\u2019re now fighting. Other family members chose not to get involved.

They have big feelings. My 3yo has developmental issues with his communications. He has massive tantrums BUT they NEVER last more then a few min. Why? Because it's our job as parents to help them with those big feelings, and cope. Not coddle. And to teach them appropriate behavior and how to get things they want and need WITHOUT the tantrums.  At 3, their tantrums should be winding down and phasing out. Not an hour long; that's unacceptable.", "YTA. You should be helping your 3yo navigate his feelings, not just letting him throw down until he is over it. They get big feelings, and they need help understanding how to deal with it.

Screaming for 2hrs is way not ok.", "NTA\n\nWhat your houseguest did is not acceptable and I would no longer entertain them.\n\nI also fully agree with your parenting here. Reassurance and soothing is fine to some extent, but feeding into negative behaviour from the child as a way to get reassurance and actively calmed just teaches them that they only need to escalate their behaviour to get a positive reward. \n\nPlacid, calm and clear direction that they can choose to say please or not get what they want is the way.\n\nEdit: I also hate the use of the word distress. Fall and hurt yourself - appropriate distress, needs cuddles and positive reinforcement. Deliberately choose to behave in a way that results in not getting exactly what you want - inappropriate distress, needs calm reinforcement of reasoning why they aren't getting what they want.", "NTA\n\nSo you do her a huge favor and she tells on you to the family?

Your way is different and I have actually seen others do it. If the is throwing a tantrum sometimes the best thing is not to react till they are done. You are not in the wrong.\nIf Jessica was still concerned about the kids she should've voices her opinion to you instead of sending video messages to a family that doesn't even involve you. If she thinks there's a better alternative to calming a kid she should try it or ask you to try it. Doing things behind back just isn't the right thing.", "There will always be those who criticize mothers for their methods.

I don\u2019t see how ignoring him is teaching him to deal with his emotions. Also using YouTube as a babysitter isn\u2019t good either.

So now he just thinks that he\u2019s got to hold out for longer before you resort to YouTube to reward his tantrums but doesn\u2019t understand that option is off the table.\n\nIt\u2019s also very likely, since he\u2019s of an age where kids start developing the ability to feel jealousy, that he is still adjusting to having a new sibling in the home and is seeking attention because of that and exaggerating his bad behaviour for that reason - so he probably needs for you to arrange some one on one time without his sister there where you are doing something fun rather than having her present and in your arms or having to do some necessity like his bath during the only time he gets with you.\n\nThat isn\u2019t an asshole situation but is something to bear in mind.\n\nBut your niece is of an age where if she can see you struggling she should be offering to hold the baby for a half hour while she watches tv or something to help you get that time with your son, and she should be talking to you about it if she\u2019s having difficulty dealing with the noise rather than just telling tales to family and causing further disruption.
