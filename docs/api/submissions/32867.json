I'm an anxious person when it comes to strangers generally because I like to listen to true crime and have heard countless stories that make me more cautious yet also more anxious. I also have a ring-esque doorbell with a camera so I saw this happen on the camera.\n\nA doordasher after I placed an order had contacted me via phone asking me which house was mine. I'm presuming because it was dark he couldn't verify for himself which house it was so I directed him. At this point, there are 2 cars parked in the parking lot and I realized after looking out the front door window that he was in a wheelchair. I realized that he couldn't get up to the front of the house because of the 2 cars blocking the walkway which was too small for his wheelchair to get by.\n\nI also realized there was a van in which he got to the house and I wasn't positive if he was by himself or with others which I initially thought was weird that they didn't help him deliver the food...\n\nDespite this, my brain started supplying itself with thoughts of the worst-case-scenario as it does late at night when dealing with strangers as a woman and I just told him he could leave the food at the front of the walkway and I'd come to grab it myself to save him even more hassle. I assured him it was okay despite his protests, and he apologized and went back to the van. I waited until he got in the van (in the backseat I believe?) and waited until they completely drove off to even consider grabbing my food.\n\nI only tipped $2 before knowing my dasher because my cost wasn't that large and the location wasn't far at all from my location (10-minute drive) but if I could edit my doordash tip after I 100% would've given a larger tip. (if possible please let me know I feel terrible). I also felt worse considering he said something along the lines of not wanting to lose his job.\n\nAITA?\n\nedit: lots of people are saying ITA because they're taking the portion of the post where i said i listen to true crime as something debilitating, i totally see both sides of me being the asshole but i just mentioned the true crime bit to serve as one out of several reason why i'm more cautious and anxious about certain situations. please consider the fact that it was also getting late at night and there were people there to help him that simply didn't... please also consider that I told him to just leave it at the end of the driveway to not cause him any trouble. I also tried to raise the tip but couldn't and tipped $2 as 15% of my order rounded.

About half of my income is tips and I do appreciate good tippers, but with doordash I'm pretty sure drivers can see what the tip is and decide if they want to take the order or not. \n\nDespite what others may say, I don't think y t a for putting safety first. You saw the situation and you told him it was okay to leave it right there, and you weren't playing some sick trick where you go and complain to his employer later so I really don't see what would make you an asshole. \n\nYou had no way of foreseeing this situation and so you had to think on your feet. When a situation seems strange it's not a bad idea to proceed with caution.

I am the same way and also watch / listen to crime related stuff and have since I was a kid watching criminal minds (so I really feel you lol) and could 1000% see a situation like this happening to me. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s that big of a deal in the long run. And I don\u2019t get why he\u2019d lose his job.

That way they can secure the chair and get safely into the driver's seat.", "NTA you had him drop the food at the end of the walkway. I assume when you say front you meant the part he was closest to. Also being in a wheelchair doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not a potential danger.

Yes, you need to find a healthier way to manage your anxiety. But I don't think there's anything wrong with asking the driver to leave your food somewhere and picking it up after they leave. Touchless delivery became the norm during the pandemic and a lot of delivery services are still offering it. \n\nI feel for the disabled delivery person. I can imagine finding work is very difficult when you have to factor in a disability. That being said, most people expect food to be delivered to their door when using a service like DoorDash and there's no way for him to know before accepting an order if that house is going to have steps or a driveway that he can't access, so food delivery probably isn't a good choice for him. I don't think the onus is on the customer to accommodate him. NTA.", "YTA for that $2 tip.\n\nOther than that, probably NAH? Yeah, maybe lay off the true crime, but I also don't see how you did anything wrong. You asked him to leave it where he could access but you could get to it. Not really a big deal.", "YTA for a low tip for a delivery driver. If you're not going to tip, pick up the food yourself.", "YTA stop listening to true crime shit if it\u2019s affecting you so badly that you end up being more difficult and inconsiderate to people who don\u2019t deserve it because you\u2019re over paranoid. I\u2019m a woman too and understand the anxiety when dealing with strangers, but there needs a balance of safety and risk. I think you overreacted and made this guy\u2019s job harder needlessly. He\u2019s got it hard enough with his disability. Next time meet him halfway or give him an extra tip for his troubles.", "NAH for the actual situation of not helping the driver, asking someone to leave the food there and then collecting it is the safest course. \n\nBut YTA to him for leaving a cheap tip. And YTA to yourself for feeding your anxiety and paranoia with true crime. You know it's causing you distress, stop consuming this shit.", "NTA for not going outside to help, your concerns weren't unreasonable.\n\nJust tip better.", "YTA\n\nListening to true crime shows when you know you are an anxious person is totally self-defeating! I\u2019d focus on self care instead, if I was you.", "Man if true crime freaks you out this bad you gotta stop listening to it. Or tbh pick the food up yourself instead of having it delivered so you're more in control of the situation and don't have anyone coming to your house. \n\nNot sure if you can call DD support to change your tip. Not cool. \n\nYTA", "YTA. In the future tip better.", "NTA, but the I concerned about your level of anxiety. I would recommend stopping the true crime stuff (I love it too!) and get some therapy to work on that.", "If you let your fears dictate every moment of your life you will never truly live.\n\nLearn some self defense, carry a weapon if you must and then let it go.\n\nLive your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
