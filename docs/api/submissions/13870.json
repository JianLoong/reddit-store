{"id": 13870, "submission_id": "12a4gd1", "title": "AITA for going back on my plans about MIL moving in with us because she got a dog?", "selftext": "Last year my MIL came to me and my husband and talked to us about buying a house together because she was getting old and we were looking to buy anyways but having difficulties. She has perfect credit, we do not. It was agreed that we would be cosigners on her loan, get our names on the deed and pay 70% of the mortgage (we have kids, whereas she just has her so it was split up fairly). All was well and good and we started home searching. \n\nWell, we found a house we all agreed on roughly 2 months ago but haven't signed anything yet due to inspections and all that. We did the initial paperwork of course and paid for the inspection but haven't made any offers and won't until after the inspections are complete, which is next week. We have not seen my MIL since the original showing of the property because we have all been busy working. \n\nWell, she showed up here today and had a giant, untrained and way too energetic rottweiler with her. We asked who's dog it was and she said he was hers. That she just adopted him. As soon as she said that I had already decided I would not be moving in with her but it was really set in stone when the dog went after my cat. My MIL was laughing saying the dog was just playing (supposedly the dog loves cats but he was growling) but I didn't trust it. This dog is massive. Hands down the biggest rotty I've ever seen. Not only that but I'm terrified of dogs as is (I have scars on the back of my head and my back by a German shepherd) and sadly enough, my MIL fucking knows that. So I politely said \"Yeah sorry but this isn't going to work out\". She asked what I was talking about, as the inspection is complete next week and I very bluntly told her she should have considered that before adopting an untrained animal that I can't trust around my cats or kids. My husband asked if she would be willing to re-home the dog and she immediately freaked out and said \"would I ask you to re-home your kid?\" And walked out. My husband is on the fence because this plan has been in affect for awhile but he completely understands my stance and boundaries. He also doesn't want this dog around the kids. But my MIL has done everything in her power to guilt us and have others do the same since this happened earlier. Including having the real estate agent contact us and try convincing us to go through with the deal because of how much effort we have put in and \"just deal with the dog later\".

And call me cynical but this reeks of a power play by MIL. If she can force a deeply unwanted dog on your family, she knows she can get her way on anything. Much like the dog itself, she's trying to piss on her territory. Stand your ground, this will only get worse otherwise.", "NTA. She wants to live with you and then shows ZERO consideration for you and gets a huge dog?? I\u2019m animal lover and I\u2019d never do that without discussing it with the person/people I am living with.", "NTA.  If your MIL will get a big dog now, while you're trying to buy a house together, and knowing your fear of dogs, it will only get worse later, once you're locked in to living together.", "NTA\n\nYour MIL intentionally adopted this dog without discussing it with you or your husband.  You're actually really fortunate she did this BEFORE you bought a house together with her.  Things would be far worse for you if she waited until after you co-owned a house with her and then showed up with this dog.\n\nAfter this behavior, you absolutely shouldn't buy anything with her.  Nor should you agree to live with you, nor have any financial dealings with her.", "NTA What a stupid comment she made about your kids. Your husband needs to tell her the agreement was made with her knowing about your cats and kids, but no agreement was made including a large, untrained Rottweiler. Plus, from a perfectly practical point of view, it will limit your ability to find homeowners insurance. Most won't cover you if you own Bully type dogs, Rottweilers, and sometimes even German Shepherds. \n\nPut your foot down with your husband. She's his to deal with.. Don't cave. You have reason to be concerned and also don't need to deal with the stress of keeping your kids and cats safe in your home that you are supposed to feel safe and comfortable in", "NTA. If you're all going to be buying a house & living together, communication is key...not to mention mutual respect. She knows you're terrified of dogs and went out and adopted one anyway without talking to you/your husband first and now just expects you to accept it (AND when you have kids & a pre-existing cat to consider)??! Major red flags. This woman is going to be a NIGHTMARE to live with. If she's trying to force an untrained dog on you before an offer's even been signed, imagine what she'll do when you're actually living together. Run, don't walk, to the nearest exit \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA at this point, the deal should be permanently off. Even if she rehomes this dog, Once you sign those papers, there is absolutely nothing stopping her from getting that dog back or another one to adopt. You won\u2019t have any way of getting rid of the dog and you\u2019d have to use legal action to get out of owning the home. It\u2019s just a bad idea all around. Risky to begin with, but now that she\u2019s proven to be untrustworthy? It\u2019d be shooting yourselves in the foot to move forward.", "NTA. You were correct to put your foot down. Make sure husband is on board; he should be the one to confront his mother about her unacceptable behavior.", "NTA. It is important to prioritize the safety and well-being of your family and pets. It is unfortunate that your MIL adopted a new pet without considering the impact it would have on your living situation. It is not fair for her to guilt or pressure you into compromising your safety and comfort. It seems indicative of a potential decisions she'll make in the future. How long has she lived solo? It seems to be a newer concept for her to grasp that certain decisions are household decisisions and not just 'me' decisions.", "NTA She did this with malice knowing that you have a real feat of dogs. Also? What kind of grandma compares her newly-acquired dog to her grandkids. Nope. Who knows what else she\u2019d do once you were trapped in a mortgage with her?", "NTA. Don't get trapped into home ownership with this person.", "NTA.\n\nThe moment I read on your text you were planning  to move in  with your MIL,  immediately came to my mind \" That is a super bad idea\".\n\nYou are lucky  the dog situation happened before you bought the home together to give you a glimpse of what  you may face by living with her.\n\n**I strongly suggest you to give up of this idea of buying a home together** , because If she is like that now just imagine how she is going to behave once the home is bought and she thinks  she did you all a favor.  \n\nMIL can be loving, nice and you  can all have a good time together as  long she lives in her own home and never on yours!  \n\n I understand your MIL  is getting weaker and need help, but  I also need to point out  that neither of you or your husband are trained to deal with elderly, you both already have 2 kids to raise and if both work there will be no one to help her most of the day. **In other words what kind of help can you both really offer her?** Can this help fulfill all her needs? Not only that do you have the money to adapt the home to help an elder and avoid accidents? \n\n She may be strong to be independent and take care of herself now, but with time she may need more attention, more help and a good retire home it is what she needs. Many think is heartless to do that, but as person that  got trained and did a course  to take care of elderly ( when i was young i want to work in that field) , I must say family members usually do a horrible job because of lack of knowledge, resource and time. \n\n**Please talk to your husband and give up of this idea of living together with your MIL** and  if she is still strong enough to be independent and take care of herself I suggest she live  nearer to you so she can visit your family, have a good time together and she can keep her dog.", ">try convincing us to go through with the deal because of how much effort we have put in\n\nThat's a sunk cost fallacy.  The work you've already put in is done either way.  What you want to look at is the remaining cost/benefit moving from this point forward.  The costs and risk of living with that dog, and with your MIL who would pull a shit move like that, are way too high.  \n\nYou're right to walk away from this.  I wouldn't re-engage even if she did give up the dog now.  She likes drama and power and will make living together hellish.", "Wow, are you NOT the AH here!\n\nTypical MIL: crazy, self-righteous, unreasonable, waits for the last minute to throw a wrench into the works with a vast Rottweiler whose behavior around other animals is clearly hostile.\n\nAnd she has the gall to tell you to deal with this menace later.\n\nYou have kids to protect and your own peace of mind and just in case you didn't know, Rottweilers can be EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.\n\nIsn't it worth noticing that MIL didn't adopt a toy poodle? She knew exactly what she was up to, and if you let her visit you with that monster dog, you will be sorry. That woman is living in a stat of vindictive rage.\n\nAnd any other party that contacts you to pressure you to go in with MIL on this house should be put on the NC list.\n\nDon't let them guilt you! Goodbye, dog!", "You're incredibly lucky she's shown her red flags now. That Realtor is probably just upset she didn't wait till you closed escrow to go buy a crazy big dog. NTA, and this would be a deal killer for me too. No compromise, just done.", "Honestly dude, you're signing a legal document to co- own something with this lady. If there are this many problems before you even move in, it will only get much much worse. I honestly love rotties, I have a rottie/ pittie mix and he is an angel, but full rotties are huge and so energetic and such a handful. NTA OP, you have the right to say no to things when you're doing something as big as buying a house.You had an agreement BEFORE she got the dog. How would she like it if you all of a sudden said \"Oh and my cousin Rickey will be living with us, he's a crackhead and likes to listen to heavy metal\". Like no. The only thing else I could say is maybe you could come up with an agreement? Like the dog isn't allowed upstairs and she has to take him to weekly training classes? My dog is my best friend and I would never rehome him to appease someone I would be moving in with, I'd rather cut off my right arm.", "NTA. Do not go through with this. Nothing has been signed. Better to take the loss for the cost of inspections than put your kids and pets in harms way.", "NTA OP.  **DON'T DO IT!!!**  And don't listen to the real estate agent because they are only concerned about their commission fee.\n\nI'm saying this as a dog lover, especially Working dogs (Rotts, Pits, etc...).  Your MIL is probably too old to give this Rott the training and energy required for working dogs.", "NTA - Imagine if you\u2019d have actually gone through with this purchase?  That dog is a GOOD BOY.   He did you a favor.  \n\nLet her and the dog enjoy their new home together.", "NTA.  There's your out. Take it. Honestly, it sounds like you've dodged a big bullet, here. A dog is not a child and should never be compared to one.  It should also make you rethink the situation given that she did something so impulsive as adopt a pet without consulting the people she was going to be living with.", "INFO:\n\nIs a manipulative power play (I think u/crockofpot nailed it on the head) out of the ordinary or par for the course with your MIL?\n\nI\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s too far beyond possibility to consider that she wants to back out of the agreement but not be the \u201cbad guy\u201d by being the party who backs out. She went and did something she figured you\u2019d put your foot down about and terminate the agreement. And if you didn\u2019t put your foot down, she knows she\u2019ll be the one holding all the cards in the relationship.\n\nI would bet a big bag of Cadbury Mini Eggs that she is not planning on keeping that dog. I\u2019m inclined to think that either the dog belongs to a friend/acquaintance (she might be dogsitting  while the dog\u2019s human is out of town), or she found a facility that will allow her to return the dog if the dog \u201cisn\u2019t a good fit\u201d into an established home.\n\nEven if she doesn\u2019t want out of the deal, your wanting to back out over her dog puts her in a martyr position and gives her a major bargaining chip for future negotiations. \u201cI gave up my dog so you could get a house! The least you could do now is [fill-in-the-blank]!\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t fall for it.", "NTA, and she just showed you perfectly what living with her is going to be like.
