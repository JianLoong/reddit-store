It actually doesn't even matter that it's your parents that he posted like this about (though of course it matters to you that it's your parents). The fact that he's happy to post it about anyone says exactly what kind of person he is. Just another AH hiding behind \"it's just a joke\" because he can't admit he's an AH. I wouldn't want to help him either and he definitely deserves the consequences of his actions.", "Nta Steve has alot of nerve to tell you your being childish and unkind.
