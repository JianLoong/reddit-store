It actually doesn't even matter that it's your parents that he posted like this about (though of course it matters to you that it's your parents). The fact that he's happy to post it about anyone says exactly what kind of person he is. Just another AH hiding behind \"it's just a joke\" because he can't admit he's an AH. I wouldn't want to help him either and he definitely deserves the consequences of his actions.", "Nta Steve has alot of nerve to tell you your being childish and unkind. When he was the one that did a childish and very unkind thing to your parents. I wouldn't want to help him out either. If he doesn't like people passing out pamphlets of whatever kind he doesn't need to take it. His actions have consequences and you have every right to not help him.", "NTA - That was kind of petty though.  Sometimes people need to learn that talking shit about people they don\u2019t know tends to backfire.", "NTA.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t a \u201csilly joke\u201d to you.

If you guys have been acquaintances since high school, there's no way he didn't recognize your father.", "NAH\n\nI cannot fault you for getting upset about your parents being insulted. That said, Steve is right. People peddling their religion on campus are annoying af. \n\nWould you have cared if the picture was not of your parents?", "In no way was his post \"a joke\"!", "Fatality lol that's such a savage clap back. I love it.", "That\u2019s what I was wondering, though it\u2019s possible because I don\u2019t know many of the parents of people I went to school with but I was a bit of a loner so\u2026", "Most of the people I went to school with didn\u2019t know what my parents looked like.

That's fair.\n\nSteve needs to take advantage of the resources available to him (tutors, office hours with the professor, the TAs, etc.) if he wants to pass the class.

Jeebus would be proud.", "ESH. Steve shouldn't be engaging in bullying tactics like comments about appearance. But also, what your parents are doing is likely intrusive and unwelcome for many students. I get that it's not a big deal for you since you were raised in their faith even if you don't practice it now, so it probably feels normal to you, but for kids of other religions having to deal with Christians coming at them with pamphlets when they're just trying to walk to class is equally if not more obnoxious than what Steve did. I hear you saying what your parents are doing is non-denominational but I've noticed frequently Christians and former Christians describe things as non-denominational when there aren't overt mentions of Jesus but there still is a clear Christian bent...so are you really sure about that? As someone raised in the faith do you have a good idea of what a non-Christian influenced religious space would look like? Do your parents routinely work with other faith leaders to make sure their space is actually an equally welcoming space for all? And since you're defending your parents without considering Steve's likely valid perspective, ESH.", "Possibly gonna get downvoted here but ESH.\n\nSteve's an asshole and can deal with his own shit. There was zero reason to insult your dad's appearance. Easy as.\n\nBut what your parents are doing is likely also incredibly invasive, and yes, annoying as fuck. I know that what they're doing is non-denominational, but lemme tell you something. People trying to get others to go to a religious service is incredibly unwelcome.", "Really depends how big the school was and how close they were. My highschool had about 300 students in my grade, and I couldn't have matched parents to classmates in most cases.", "Lol", "The OP did say she was atheist......", "This, all of this.\n\nI wasn't raised with any particular religion, neither were my siblings, but we all turned out as atheists or neopagans. We're also all queer. My brother is specifically gay and trans. My sister and I are bi and ace respectively.\n\nA LOT of Christians are using their religion (or are philandering with others with a less religious framing to further their cause) to basically make it so my family can no longer go to the states to visit my dad's family, at risk of my parents being slapped with child sexual abuse charges for letting my brother socially transition, lobby for bringing similar laws to Canada, and are lobbying on both sides of the border for our reproductive rights to be stripped away from us, and also just general rampant queerphobia.\n\nAnd a LOT of the Christians who are doing the things I described above are also the types who would hand out literature to everyone.\n\nYou can't exactly blame us if we don't exactly take kindly to some random Christians inviting us to church with a leaflet. It sets off red flags for US, and we were raised in a family that accepts us for being queer and has always been chill about gender.\n\nImagine how this would feel for ex-Christians who've left the church due to the rampant homophobia, transphobia and misogyny, or for non-Christians who've experienced racist and xenophobic policies due to the influence of the church, or for queer Christians or Christian women who've had to deal with a religion that largely does not love them back.\n\nI understand OP's parents probably have good intentions, but the facts are that shoving leaflets at everyone is a dick move. Religious trauma is real, and people have a negative view of Christianity, and the types of Christians who hand out leaflets, in the English-speaking world for a reason.\n\nAlso Steve is an asshole. But that's obvious.", "And I  wasn't being sarcastic.  The Christians I know fully believe humans are disposable the moment they do something contrary to what they want.", "I don\u2019t like street proselytizing at all.

He isn't that wise to insult the person who's gonna help him pass class parents in a semi public way. \n\nDude gets to fail and learn some life lessons.\n\nEdit a joke is funny to all involved. This was bullying.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a silly joke and it\u2019s not funny. From where I, an Old, sit, this will be a very valuable lesson for Steve. He\u2019ll get through college one way or another, but he won\u2019t forget that this kind of ridiculing (or flipping rude gestures, or whatever) can work out badly for him. It\u2019s clearly info he needs to know.", "NTA\n\nSteve has learned not to judge other people and that actions have consequences.", "NTA. Maybe you shouldn't have blown up at him but just said, you have enough time to insult other people's parents so maybe you should spend more time on your studies and learn it on your own.", "NTA.  Pleasantly surprised that reddit isn\u2019t screeching \u201cY-T-A\u201c at you considering how much reddit hates Christians.  Steve can reap what he\u2019s sewn.\n\nYour parents seem like kind people who are just really passionate and enthusiastic and also very welcoming and accepting.  There are a few groups like that in my city who go around handing out leaflets and just generally being very kind.  No anti-LGBT stuff, nothing hateful, just a genuine love for what they do, and they\u2019re not disruptive at all (no megaphones, microphones, etc) and will immediately back off if you shake your head, so it\u2019s always really sad to see them being \u201ccounter-protested\u201d by people who cause genuine disruption in the form of shrieking and blocking traffic and blasting music over them.", "NTA", "The consequences of his own assholery. So beautiful.\n\nNTA, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA.", "NTA. Steven's comments were not a \"silly joke\", they were a direct attack not so much on your parents (although that does make the situation worse), but on people who are just genuinely trying to help without pushing their faith agenda on others.\n\nI was hearted to read your description of their work. It sounds like they have actually read and understood the Bible and it's entire context (other people are not required to share your exact belief structure, everyone is deserving of love and assistance, the door to their faith is always open in invitation but it's an individual's choice whether or not to enter, etc.).

If they wanted to truly create a free space they didn't need to advertise it as a Christian organization. Downvote me all you want, but religious missionaries, especially ones disguised as benevolent nice guys, suck", "Lol", "Than they are not Christians but fake ones.
