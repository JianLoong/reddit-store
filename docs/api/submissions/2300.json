But also, what your parents are doing is likely intrusive and unwelcome for many students. I get that it's not a big deal for you since you were raised in their faith even if you don't practice it now, so it probably feels normal to you, but for kids of other religions having to deal with Christians coming at them with pamphlets when they're just trying to walk to class is equally if not more obnoxious than what Steve did. I hear you saying what your parents are doing is non-denominational but I've noticed frequently Christians and former Christians describe things as non-denominational when there aren't overt mentions of Jesus but there still is a clear Christian bent...so are you really sure about that? As someone raised in the faith do you have a good idea of what a non-Christian influenced religious space would look like?

We're also all queer. My brother is specifically gay and trans. My sister and I are bi and ace respectively.\n\nA LOT of Christians are using their religion (or are philandering with others with a less religious framing to further their cause) to basically make it so my family can no longer go to the states to visit my dad's family, at risk of my parents being slapped with child sexual abuse charges for letting my brother socially transition, lobby for bringing similar laws to Canada, and are lobbying on both sides of the border for our reproductive rights to be stripped away from us, and also just general rampant queerphobia.\n\nAnd a LOT of the Christians who are doing the things I described above are also the types who would hand out literature to everyone.\n\nYou can't exactly blame us if we don't exactly take kindly to some random Christians inviting us to church with a leaflet. It sets off red flags for US, and we were raised in a family that accepts us for being queer and has always been chill about gender.\n\nImagine how this would feel for ex-Christians who've left the church due to the rampant homophobia, transphobia and misogyny, or for non-Christians who've experienced racist and xenophobic policies due to the influence of the church, or for queer Christians or Christian women who've had to deal with a religion that largely does not love them back.\n\nI understand OP's parents probably have good intentions, but the facts are that shoving leaflets at everyone is a dick move. Religious trauma is real, and people have a negative view of Christianity, and the types of Christians who hand out leaflets, in the English-speaking world for a reason.\n\nAlso Steve is an asshole.

Seems like someone should be looking in the mirror a little more.", "There was a woman who did this on my university campus and eventually the university had her banned from all their properties which was large bit of town. She was targetting quite vulnerable students,especially after exams, telling them they were dammed and going to hell if not reptentant. \n\nI am not saying that the parents are doing anything remotely that bad but if they do a hard sell, then can see how could rile people. Our chaplain offered similar service but though it was advertised well on bulletin boards etc, the person needed to go to him to ask for it. But if just handing out leaflets rather than saying \"You look stressed, we could help\", I can't see the issue.  \n\nRegardless, NTA. OP not obliged to help anyone.", "You don't understand the difference in power dynamics (in the US, it would be different in India) between a Hindu talking about an \"interfaith space\" and a Christian talking about an \"interfaith space\"? Seems like someone should be looking in a history book a little more.", "Yeah, if OP's parents were the type of weirdos that go on college campuses and rant about how abortion is destroying the fabric of society, I'd get it. But OP's parents literally run a free service for the university and, while enthusiastic about their religion, don't seem to be proselytizing.", "Oh same problem at my university but they can't get rid of her. The organization she is apart of sued the school is the past, so they are kinda afraid of her. She specifically targets trans students.", "That sounds like an Episcopalian.  I was raised Episcopal, and I've been an atheist since I was a child, but I respect them, much more so than most other Christian sects. Like all Christian sects, they have their high church and low church and even a few people who would probably be much happier in a born-again Evangelical church, but mostly they're truly nice and kind people.", "Yeah my parents can say some STUFF sometimes. But you don't get to randomly bash them and get my help.  Sorry, pass.", "The problem here is lumping all Christians together.  You have every right to be concerned about the right wing (I won\u2019t say Evangelica) Christians. They spew bigotry and contempt even for other Christians who don\u2019t follow them.  I hate being lumped in with those haters. Every religious group has its radicals but here it seems that the far right Christians are gaining a foothold.", "I had like a FOUR Year old hand me a pamphlet on campus one time. They were cute so I took it, not knowing what was inside until I crossed the bridge yo the adults with the posters. WHY WPULD YOU HAVE YOUR CHILDREN PASS THAT STUFF OUT?? IT'S DISTURBING, NOT CUTE!", "To quote my longer comment on why I think it's an optics issue regardless of intent\n\n> If I see a drunken frat spilling out of their party and catcalling passers-by, I'm not going to their parties. Even if the behaviour I've seen is, in and of itself, harmless. Basic self-preservation.\n\nThere are some great frats. I don't think all frats are the same, and I have a good friend who is a Christian priest. If I boycotted Christians as friends, I'd have a bad time lol. But sometimes - a lot of times - I don't have the energy to cope with the risks of a closer look at people handing out leaflets and talking about Jesus.", "That's exactly why, because you'd take the pamphlet from a little kid.\n\nAlso, they don't see things the way most of us do.\n\nWhen I was a 1L in law school, some radical group came on campus and just spent hours shouting epithets and trying to antagonize students. They weren't even there to actually push whatever cause they actually supported, they just wanted to film students reacting to them and edit videos to make it look like they were legitimately protesting and some people wanted to put a stop to their First Amendment rights.", "ESH. Steve shouldn't be using a class groupchat as his personal joke site and you should be acting professional. Your parents made their choice to put themselves in the crosshairs of scrutiny for their beliefs.", "BAHAHA\n\nJust ignore this dude and let him fail\n\nBlock his number and if he continues to harass you report it to the school.\n\nAlso, let your parents know what happened so they don't get caught off guard by this guy or anyone else.\n\nThey will probably tell you to forgive and forget, but just respond with something like *I do not harbor any ill will towards Steve for his immature actions.  But I also don't have to do him any favors either.  Steve needs to understand that actions have consequences because that is part of growing up and being an adult.*\n\nNTA", "NTA - its Karma", "NTA, but Steve sounds right your parent are proselytizing to students and that is pretty fucking annoying.", "NTA. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t help him.", "NTA.  As many people in this group have said, \"make stupid comments, win stupid prizes.\"  Since he knew you in high school, it is unlikely he doesn't know who your parents are.", "If you where friends enough in high school to hang he has probably meet your parents so yeah you Nta he is though", "I kind of have gone through a similar experience as you.  My dad would dig through the public trash bins downtown and recycle cans.  He would also mow lawns for people that paid him.  Not everyone in town knew he was my dad.\nHe was talked about in my school.  There were people I dropped as friends when I overheard what they said about him.\nYou were lucky enough to find out what kind of person Steve really is.  Now avoid him.", "That's because the are actually behaving like Christians. I may not share their faith, but I can appreciate their honest adherence to the good aspects of the religion.", "I didn\u2019t know half of the students I went to hs with parents.  It all depends on how close OP and Steve wore in high school. I had several \u201cfriends\u201d that I never introduced to my family.", "In the context of the above post, it really doesn't matter. Steve said rude things about OP's parents, so, naturally, OP no longer wants to help Steve with his homework. OP is NTA and Steve is suffering the consequences of his actions. \n\nAnd considering Steve was so willing so say 'it was a joke' instead of standing by his original statement to get what he wants, I doubt he really cares about the valid point you're making in your post, either.", "You are flat wrong about the antichristian sentiments here on reddit AITA. I have been reading for a couple of months. I have never seen a proselytizing post by a Christian, nor have i seen anyone use a Biblical justification for a moral verdict. But if a christian dares to explain a misconception (like what a baptism or mass is), the post will get dozens of downvotes and comments that would be downright shocking if they were directed against Jews or Muslims. In this case, if it wasnt OP describing his \"friend\"'s action, but \"Steve\" defending what he did, i am certainly he would be absolved and declared NTA because he would describe them as annoying.", "You're nta because you're not obligated to help anyone, but you should be thicker skinned about how people react to evangelizing.\n\nNobody likes being preached to, and a ton of people have actual trauma due to pushy religious people in their family, community, and the world. Just because they do it with a smile on their face doesn't make them harmless.\n\nIf some people get really annoyed when they get yet another religious pamphlet, that just comes with the territory.  Your parents surely understand that.", "I mean, I am internally exasperated when I see people handing out pamphlets on the sidewalk (do you really think a person living in urban Canada hasn't heard of Jesus?) but as long as they're polite, I'm polite back.", "As long as they accept no, I can deal with the annoyance. \ud83e\udd37", "Can't make babies cry.", "NTA. Obviously, Steve is also having a hard time understanding the definition of unkind and childish. He needs to read his own posts and that might give him an idea.", "NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s a raging AH, you did the exact thing I would\u2019ve done", "NTA - Maybe he should use the service your parents help provide to the students to pray for success.", "NTA he is not entitled to your help and you do not need to put yourself out to help anyone, let alone someone who has insulted your parents and thinks mocking people who provide a lovely service to highly stressed students is funny. \nHe is at university to learn and it's unfortunate it's taken this long for the lesson \"people don't help people who are needlessly rude\" to come up but from his reaction (how is he surprised you don't like people who insult your parents? Why does he think anyone owes him their time and attention) it is surely a needed one.", "OP, NTA. \n\nEven if Steve didn't know they were your parents, he showed his true self. So many people fall back on \"it was a joke!\" after they have FAFO'd ...", "Schrodinger's insult. Someone's offended? It's just a joke. No offense? Lay out heavier insults.", "BAN THE YMCA", "Idk my uni would sometime have religious weirdos guarding the entrances to the dining hall and the main courtyard (our campus was on the side of a mountain so you had to pass through the courtyard to get from classes to dorms.\n\nThey would pushy as all get out and would force a mini Bible on you so everyone hated them.", "Well that falls under not accepting no. Which makes them a problem not deserving kindness.", "NTA. I have noticed a lot of anti Christian and anti religion in general stuff the past few years. From mayors and Governors keeping churches/synagogues closed for Covid far longer that stores and businesses (until the courts started slapping those rules down as discriminatory) to individuals attacking Jews on the street to many slurs against Muslims. From both left and right, politically. This is bad in a country that supposedly has freedom to practice religion, or to choose not to. Your classmate may be of that ilk. I am glad you are not so bigoted.\n\nAnd some of this is violent. Of the 7,759 serious reported hate crimes in 2020, 1,174 targeted victims due to their religion. https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2021-08-31/ty-article/.premium/jews-most-targeted-religious-group-in-2020-hate-crimes-fbi-says/0000017f-f752-d044-adff-f7fb564b0000?_amp=true", "NTA.

You are not helping him.", "Please excuse me as I get PTSD flashbacks from helping my wife through her anatomy classes LOL.", "NTA He knew they're your parents, guaranteed.", "NTA.  He played a stupid game and won a stupid prize.", "Here's my thought: He's never taken and read a pamphlet, so he just jumped to conclusions about the situation. Furthermore, he expected others in the group chat to support his comments, thus giving him popularity points. Unfortunately, the opposite happened, at least with OP.\n\nNTA OP. It hurts more because it was your parents, but I think plenty of people would hesitate or refuse to help someone with such a terrible attitude towards others.", "Depends on the verdict, especially if it is viewed as restricting freedom in some way (one thing that the west really struggles with, especially thanks to how the Catholic church combined church and state for over a thousand years, is where to draw the line between something that the bible speaks against as morally wrong/unhealthy and allowing people the freedom if that morally wrong thing doesn't violate the freedom of others). I would suspect that many of those who make those downvotes and comments have similar thoughts about some Jewish and Islamic beliefs, but refrain from making them out of fear of the backlash that would follow.", "Dude. Common courtesy must be dead if you think that. Like, if they were pushy and loud? Sure, tell em off. They deserve it then but it sounds like OP'S parents were just *checks notes* offering pamphlets to passers-by. I'm a pagan chaos witch and I wouldn't be offended by that. Hell, I have religious trauma and I wouldn't be offended by that. They're just doing their own thing and offering a service to people. Doesn't even sound like they're pushing. They're just there offering. If they don't take no for an answer then that's a problem but it doesn't sound like that. No reason to be an ash to or about someone for handing out reading material politely.\n\n\nIf you want to be mad at Chrisitians, get mad at the Catholic church (the organization itself because there are plenty of good people who are Catholic) or the Westboro Baptist Church (can they just stop existing please?). Like, we have actual entities that cause continual trauma to so many people but we get mad at Chrisitans politely offering a pamphlet??? Like, if they're polite then be polite back. Don't judge someone you don't know unless you have some solid ducking evidence that they are being, well, evil and/or knowingly impolite. Especially don't do so to others and then expect no consequences from your actions. OP is allowed to offended just as much as those of us with religious trauma are allowed to be offended. Especially when it comes to stereotypes and misinformation. Mind you, I'm mostly upset about this because the whole thing is rude. Rudeness isn't attractive nor should it be acceptable from anyone. Be an adult and be polite UNLESS someone is being knowingly impolite to you. Then all the bets are off and the gloves go flying.", "op said they were handing out leaflets. personally i was raised by fundies and 18-20yo me would have been pissed to be leafleted on campus by church people. especially YoungLife. \n\nNTA tho bc Op is doesn\u2019t have to help him and its valid to be pissed at someone saying shit about your parents that you find insulting!", "i was hauled out proselytizing as a kid and i gotta tell you, you don\u2019t hand out leaflets by being chill and respecting soft no\u2019s. (still nta, op found it insulting and doesn\u2019t have to help him.)", "INFO: Would you have reacted like that if he was body shaming and creepshotting any other strangers or were you just upset cause it was your parents?", "Proselytising should be illegal, it's annoying and frequently preys on the vulnerable.", "exactly!", "Yeah, I definitely didn't know everyone in my grade, and I never met anyone's parents."]}
