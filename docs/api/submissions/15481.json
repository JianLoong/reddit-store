You're doing great to protect it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA he is acting entitled to money that isn't his, even if you didnt have that money set aside for your daughter it is YOUR money. He has absolutely NO rights to it and needs to stop acting like a spoiled brat.", "NTA, sounds a bit like the beginning to the prodigal son story. He should've been more financially responsible, plus he has a wife too... What's she doing to help? What about her family?", "A 34 year-old man demanding a teenager's money says a lot about who he is as a person. His financial difficulties aren't your daughter's responsibility to solve, especially not at the expense of her start into adulthood. If he's in a situation of losing his home (despite having received financial help from you for that same purpose when he was 18), he must've been making some really bad decisions for a long time. Stick to your plans and don't sacrifice your daughter's future for him. He's an adult, married to an adult, they will have to find a way to work things out. \n\nNTA, your son is for being entitled and not appreciating the help you already gave him.", "NTA. \nAt the age of 34 your son needs to stand on his own two feet and take care of his family. He shouldn't expect his parents to still be covering for him. It's unbelievable that he has wasted his own resources and now expects to be given his younger sisters money. And whatever he says, he wouldn't be paying it back. Don't let him take his sisters money!", "NTA, you are just treating each child equally. You've already helped your son earlier in his life. Your son's circumstances are unfortunate but he is an adult and they are more his responsibility than yours and his bad luck, or behavior, or both, don't justify harming another one of your children who hasn't yet gotten the benefits that your son already received.", "NTA, it sucks that you can\u2019t help him, but repurposing your daughters money isn\u2019t an option. It\u2019s hers, for her future, so she can be better off in her early adulthood. You can offer to help him in other ways such as getting him groceries or giving him small amounts to help with bills that won\u2019t make much of an impact on you (assuming you can afford it, of course). You can also offer to help him apply for unemployment or food stamps and help him look for recourses within your community.", "NTA. Something massive happened if he lost his job and his home in short order, something he isn't telling you and he should be upfront about that.

Your second son sounds very entitled. That money is not his.", "INFO: how did he lose his job and his home so fast? \n\nI don't think it really matters, you're NTA anyway, but I all because I seriously doubt that's all there is to the story.

As I was reading your post I was worried that you\u2019d give him. Thankfully you didn\u2019t. \n\nYou\u2019re doing the same thing for all 3 of your kids.

She's still got a home anyways. But it would be really unfair towards her, especially since it doesn't sound like he's even planning on ever paying her back.", "He's being entitled so NTA for not handing over what is in fact his sister's money.\n\nBUT it's really not up to us Redditors to start saying your son deserves everything he's got, should have made better decisions, etc. Who knows what's happened to him? Most importantly, there are two kids - OP's grandkids - in this story who are now homeless.\n\nOP can you offer non-financial help - by homing your grandkids while your son sorts things out?

There's 4 of us, six years apart (1966-1972). The amount of money each of us received was the same, and was only given when we were actually in the process of buying our first home. There was actually much more than six years from the time the first one of us bought a house to when the last of us bought a house, and the buying power of that nest egg was much lower for me than it was for my other brothers. However, it was still a reasonable amount, and it would have been crazy to insist on it being adjusted for inflation. One of my brothers had a house fire, and needed to borrow some money (to rebuild) from dad before I bought my house. That money didn't come from my house down payment money, it was a completely different transaction. Our dad had the money to loan, and my brother paid it back in the time promised. \n\nIf you have the extra money to help your son out (as a loan, with VERY strict terms) and this is something you want to do, there is no problem doing this. If that is not the case (don't have the money/don't want to loan or give it) there is no reason he should make you feel like an AH. You're simply trying to give your daughter the same advantage you gave him, 16 years ago.
