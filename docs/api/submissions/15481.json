Sounds like your son has been making some poor choices for quite a while if things have managed to get to that state.\n\nIt is your daughter's money and your son is an entitled brat. You're doing great to protect it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA he is acting entitled to money that isn't his, even if you didnt have that money set aside for your daughter it is YOUR money. He has absolutely NO rights to it and needs to stop acting like a spoiled brat.", "NTA, sounds a bit like the beginning to the prodigal son story. He should've been more financially responsible, plus he has a wife too... What's she doing to help? What about her family?", "A 34 year-old man demanding a teenager's money says a lot about who he is as a person. His financial difficulties aren't your daughter's responsibility to solve, especially not at the expense of her start into adulthood. If he's in a situation of losing his home (despite having received financial help from you for that same purpose when he was 18), he must've been making some really bad decisions for a long time. Stick to your plans and don't sacrifice your daughter's future for him. He's an adult, married to an adult, they will have to find a way to work things out. \n\nNTA, your son is for being entitled and not appreciating the help you already gave him.", "NTA. \nAt the age of 34 your son needs to stand on his own two feet and take care of his family. He shouldn't expect his parents to still be covering for him. It's unbelievable that he has wasted his own resources and now expects to be given his younger sisters money. And whatever he says, he wouldn't be paying it back. Don't let him take his sisters money!", "NTA, you are just treating each child equally. You've already helped your son earlier in his life. Your son's circumstances are unfortunate but he is an adult and they are more his responsibility than yours and his bad luck, or behavior, or both, don't justify harming another one of your children who hasn't yet gotten the benefits that your son already received.", "NTA, it sucks that you can\u2019t help him, but repurposing your daughters money isn\u2019t an option. It\u2019s hers, for her future, so she can be better off in her early adulthood. You can offer to help him in other ways such as getting him groceries or giving him small amounts to help with bills that won\u2019t make much of an impact on you (assuming you can afford it, of course). You can also offer to help him apply for unemployment or food stamps and help him look for recourses within your community.", "NTA. Something massive happened if he lost his job and his home in short order, something he isn't telling you and he should be upfront about that. Either way, that is money you saved for your daughter, his own sister, and he feels he is more entitled to it than her and it is disturbing how easily he is willing to screw over his own sister for his own mistakes. \n\nHe has a wife, isn't she helping at all? He is a grown adult with his own family and while I would offer what help I could in your position I would not do it at the expense of my other children.", "nta. you saved it for her", "NTA You decide how to spend your money. People act irrational when they are stressed about money. If this has never happened to him before then he probably doesn't know all his options. He should seek guidance from government social assistance if that's available in your area. But you can only lead an AH to water...", "NTA\n\nNothing shifts a \"No, because xyz... but let's think of other ways...\" to a resounding and firm \"NO, you ingrate\" like an entitled AH *demanding* a favor.", "NTA - your son needs help but if he lost his job AND his home it sounds like he needs more than more money thrown at him! He is also 34 and he does not get to take anything from a younger sibling because \u201che needs it more\u201d. \n\nBefore you offer any help at all, figure out what exactly happened.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t lose your home overnight.\n\nYour son has made multiple bad decisions and for a long time has put this off / ignored what was happening / did not reach out before the problem got to where it is. \n\nThis was him either not paying attention / thinking he could work it out and not being pro-active and responsible. Or expecting you to bail him out regardless so didn\u2019t put effort into preventing it before it got to this stage. \n\nThis isn\u2019t your responsibility to solve. That isn\u2019t your money to give him. It\u2019s your daughters and not fair to punish her for his lack of responsibility. \n\nHas he sold his belongings? Immediately got another job (I.e Uber) for some quick cashflow? Spoken to the bank hardship team about his position? It doesn\u2019t sound like it.", "NTA\n\nHe is old enough to take responsibility for his family. It's your daughter's money and he has to find other ways to care for his family.", "NTA. He will just have to find other ways.", "NTA - if the amount of money is significant enough for you to turn him down, then it is way too much for him to be asking for.", "NTA. Your second son sounds very entitled. That money is not his.", "INFO: how did he lose his job and his home so fast? \n\nI don't think it really matters, you're NTA anyway, but I all because I seriously doubt that's all there is to the story. Ie your son has been living way beyond his means for a LONG time.", "NTA where's his savings? His backup plan? Can he not get unemployment? Has he been secretly gambling or something? Is he prone to overdramatics?", "You don\u2019t just lose your job and house overnight. He\u2019s absolutely been making poor choices. The fact that he randomly decided to just say this one day and expect immediate help and not mentioning it as it was occurring proves that even further.\n\nIt\u2019s even more annoying when someone gets mad that you won\u2019t help them even though it\u2019s extremely unreasonable.\n\nNTA", "NTA you absolutely did the right thing to protect the money for your daughter. It\u2019s not her fault he\u2019s financially struggling. I think he should be embarrassed (not about asking for help, but for not taking the \u2018No\u2019 graciously). He\u2019s got some gall to double down and demand somebody else\u2019s gift for somebody else.", "NTA\u2014 that money is not allocated to him. He got his when he was 18. He\u2019s trying to guilt trip you into giving it to him. He isn\u2019t even asking a loan he just wants that money\u2026. But it sounds like he may make terrible financial decisions so that money won\u2019t make a lasting difference to him either.", "NTA. \n\nThankfully you are standing up for your daughter. As I was reading your post I was worried that you\u2019d give him. Thankfully you didn\u2019t. \n\nYou\u2019re doing the same thing for all 3 of your kids. The fact your son just lost his job & is about to llose his house says a LOT. \n\nIf you gave him money at 18 & he\u2019s 34 now & just lost his job, how is about to lose his house too???  Something smells fishy here. \n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing by not giving him your daughters money.", "NTA: He obviously had the same amount of money at some point and spent it. That was his choice and who's to say that your daughter's money wouldn't just go down the drain as well?", "Hm, NTA, I guess, but if you soon lost his job and home through no fault of his own, I might say NAH, since I can understand him prioritizing his family not being homeless over being fair towards his sister. She's still got a home anyways. But it would be really unfair towards her, especially since it doesn't sound like he's even planning on ever paying her back.", "He's being entitled so NTA for not handing over what is in fact his sister's money.\n\nBUT it's really not up to us Redditors to start saying your son deserves everything he's got, should have made better decisions, etc. Who knows what's happened to him? Most importantly, there are two kids - OP's grandkids - in this story who are now homeless.\n\nOP can you offer non-financial help - by homing your grandkids while your son sorts things out? He and his wife can sofa surf but the kids can't. That way, you're supporting but not enabling - and you'll know that the kids are safe.", "NTA. What an entitled son!\n\nHonestly, some discretion in info might have been in order. I have the impression you told him something like \u201csorry, it\u2019s for your sister\u201d which is unfair in making it seem somehow a competition between the two kids. When your son asked for assistance, you simply should\u2019ve told him \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t give you any more. I already gave you money for a house and I don\u2019t have any more for you \u201c", "Ask yourself two questions.

If he has a house he has a huge asset he can sell that will help him get back on his feet again.

He\u2019s a married man in his 30s. He needs to grow up and figure out his own problems. His sister deserves the same gift of money that he and his brother got.

There's 4 of us, six years apart (1966-1972). The amount of money each of us received was the same, and was only given when we were actually in the process of buying our first home. There was actually much more than six years from the time the first one of us bought a house to when the last of us bought a house, and the buying power of that nest egg was much lower for me than it was for my other brothers. However, it was still a reasonable amount, and it would have been crazy to insist on it being adjusted for inflation. One of my brothers had a house fire, and needed to borrow some money (to rebuild) from dad before I bought my house. That money didn't come from my house down payment money, it was a completely different transaction. Our dad had the money to loan, and my brother paid it back in the time promised. \n\nIf you have the extra money to help your son out (as a loan, with VERY strict terms) and this is something you want to do, there is no problem doing this. If that is not the case (don't have the money/don't want to loan or give it) there is no reason he should make you feel like an AH. You're simply trying to give your daughter the same advantage you gave him, 16 years ago.

But losing his job AND his home in one swing? There's more to this issue going on here. Something tells me handing him more money is just going to enable him more.\n\nWhat you can do at this point is offer to help with the kids - let them live with you while son and wife sort things out. Cause they are the innocents in this situation.", "NTA this is your daughter's money. Your son is a grown ass man who was able to start his life with the same amount your daughter will get and he started also a family. He has his own family now and HE needs to take care.

In addition to this, shortly before his sister is set to get her portion, he wants it to prevent his family's homelessness despite having lost his home and you refuse because it's unfair to his sister who is about to reach the exact same money inheriting milestone as her brothers?  The timing is not at all suspect.    I mean, it's all imaginary, so why not let your son and his family come back?
