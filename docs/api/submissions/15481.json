Sounds like your son has been making some poor choices for quite a while if things have managed to get to that state.\n\nIt is your daughter's money and your son is an entitled brat. You're doing great to protect it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA he is acting entitled to money that isn't his, even if you didnt have that money set aside for your daughter it is YOUR money. He has absolutely NO rights to it and needs to stop acting like a spoiled brat.", "NTA, sounds a bit like the beginning to the prodigal son story. He should've been more financially responsible, plus he has a wife too... What's she doing to help? What about her family?", "A 34 year-old man demanding a teenager's money says a lot about who he is as a person. His financial difficulties aren't your daughter's responsibility to solve, especially not at the expense of her start into adulthood. If he's in a situation of losing his home (despite having received financial help from you for that same purpose when he was 18), he must've been making some really bad decisions for a long time. Stick to your plans and don't sacrifice your daughter's future for him. He's an adult, married to an adult, they will have to find a way to work things out. \n\nNTA, your son is for being entitled and not appreciating the help you already gave him.", "NTA. \nAt the age of 34 your son needs to stand on his own two feet and take care of his family. He shouldn't expect his parents to still be covering for him. It's unbelievable that he has wasted his own resources and now expects to be given his younger sisters money. And whatever he says, he wouldn't be paying it back. Don't let him take his sisters money!", "NTA, you are just treating each child equally. You've already helped your son earlier in his life. Your son's circumstances are unfortunate but he is an adult and they are more his responsibility than yours and his bad luck, or behavior, or both, don't justify harming another one of your children who hasn't yet gotten the benefits that your son already received.", "NTA, it sucks that you can\u2019t help him, but repurposing your daughters money isn\u2019t an option. It\u2019s hers, for her future, so she can be better off in her early adulthood. You can offer to help him in other ways such as getting him groceries or giving him small amounts to help with bills that won\u2019t make much of an impact on you (assuming you can afford it, of course). You can also offer to help him apply for unemployment or food stamps and help him look for recourses within your community.", "NTA. Something massive happened if he lost his job and his home in short order, something he isn't telling you and he should be upfront about that. Either way, that is money you saved for your daughter, his own sister, and he feels he is more entitled to it than her and it is disturbing how easily he is willing to screw over his own sister for his own mistakes. \n\nHe has a wife, isn't she helping at all? He is a grown adult with his own family and while I would offer what help I could in your position I would not do it at the expense of my other children.", "nta. you saved it for her", "NTA You decide how to spend your money. People act irrational when they are stressed about money. If this has never happened to him before then he probably doesn't know all his options. He should seek guidance from government social assistance if that's available in your area. But you can only lead an AH to water...", "NTA\n\nNothing shifts a \"No, because xyz... but let's think of other ways...\" to a resounding and firm \"NO, you ingrate\" like an entitled AH *demanding* a favor.", "NTA - your son needs help but if he lost his job AND his home it sounds like he needs more than more money thrown at him! He is also 34 and he does not get to take anything from a younger sibling because \u201che needs it more\u201d. \n\nBefore you offer any help at all, figure out what exactly happened.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t lose your home overnight.\n\nYour son has made multiple bad decisions and for a long time has put this off / ignored what was happening / did not reach out before the problem got to where it is. \n\nThis was him either not paying attention / thinking he could work it out and not being pro-active and responsible. Or expecting you to bail him out regardless so didn\u2019t put effort into preventing it before it got to this stage. \n\nThis isn\u2019t your responsibility to solve. That isn\u2019t your money to give him. It\u2019s your daughters and not fair to punish her for his lack of responsibility. \n\nHas he sold his belongings? Immediately got another job (I.e Uber) for some quick cashflow? Spoken to the bank hardship team about his position? It doesn\u2019t sound like it.", "NTA\n\nHe is old enough to take responsibility for his family. It's your daughter's money and he has to find other ways to care for his family.", "NTA. He will just have to find other ways.", "NTA - if the amount of money is significant enough for you to turn him down, then it is way too much for him to be asking for.", "NTA. Your second son sounds very entitled. That money is not his.", "INFO: how did he lose his job and his home so fast? \n\nI don't think it really matters, you're NTA anyway, but I all because I seriously doubt that's all there is to the story. Ie your son has been living way beyond his means for a LONG time.", "NTA where's his savings? His backup plan? Can he not get unemployment? Has he been secretly gambling or something? Is he prone to overdramatics?", "You don\u2019t just lose your job and house overnight. He\u2019s absolutely been making poor choices. The fact that he randomly decided to just say this one day and expect immediate help and not mentioning it as it was occurring proves that even further.\n\nIt\u2019s even more annoying when someone gets mad that you won\u2019t help them even though it\u2019s extremely unreasonable.\n\nNTA", "NTA you absolutely did the right thing to protect the money for your daughter. It\u2019s not her fault he\u2019s financially struggling. I think he should be embarrassed (not about asking for help, but for not taking the \u2018No\u2019 graciously). He\u2019s got some gall to double down and demand somebody else\u2019s gift for somebody else.", "NTA\u2014 that money is not allocated to him. He got his when he was 18. He\u2019s trying to guilt trip you into giving it to him. He isn\u2019t even asking a loan he just wants that money\u2026. But it sounds like he may make terrible financial decisions so that money won\u2019t make a lasting difference to him either.", "NTA. \n\nThankfully you are standing up for your daughter. As I was reading your post I was worried that you\u2019d give him. Thankfully you didn\u2019t. \n\nYou\u2019re doing the same thing for all 3 of your kids. The fact your son just lost his job & is about to llose his house says a LOT. \n\nIf you gave him money at 18 & he\u2019s 34 now & just lost his job, how is about to lose his house too???  Something smells fishy here. \n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing by not giving him your daughters money.", "NTA: He obviously had the same amount of money at some point and spent it. That was his choice and who's to say that your daughter's money wouldn't just go down the drain as well?", "Hm, NTA, I guess, but if you soon lost his job and home through no fault of his own, I might say NAH, since I can understand him prioritizing his family not being homeless over being fair towards his sister. She's still got a home anyways. But it would be really unfair towards her, especially since it doesn't sound like he's even planning on ever paying her back.", "He's being entitled so NTA for not handing over what is in fact his sister's money.\n\nBUT it's really not up to us Redditors to start saying your son deserves everything he's got, should have made better decisions, etc. Who knows what's happened to him? Most importantly, there are two kids - OP's grandkids - in this story who are now homeless.\n\nOP can you offer non-financial help - by homing your grandkids while your son sorts things out? He and his wife can sofa surf but the kids can't. That way, you're supporting but not enabling - and you'll know that the kids are safe.", "NTA. What an entitled son!\n\nHonestly, some discretion in info might have been in order. I have the impression you told him something like \u201csorry, it\u2019s for your sister\u201d which is unfair in making it seem somehow a competition between the two kids. When your son asked for assistance, you simply should\u2019ve told him \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t give you any more. I already gave you money for a house and I don\u2019t have any more for you \u201c", "Ask yourself two questions. What would he do if both parents weren't around or if you didn't have money saved for your daughter. Life is about choices and hard decisions, it's not easy. NTA", "It should be up to your daughter.

You saved the money for your daughter, not for your middle son. It wouldn't be fair to your daughter to give away her money. Your son is an adult and should try and find another way to make things work other than begging you for money.", "NTA. It\u2019s unfair that he feels entitled to the money you\u2019ve saved up for your daughter just because she\u2019s not reached the age to use it.", "NTA your son made poor decisions all on his own and your daughter shouldn\u2019t have to pay for them.", "NTA. If you give it him it will be gone. He\u2019ll never pay it back. Then two of your children will have future problems.", "NTA. Interesting that his financial issues have become exactly dire enough to ask for your daughter\u2019s money just before you are supposed to give it to her. If he has a house he has a huge asset he can sell that will help him get back on his feet again. If he lost it, it\u2019s because he is making poor financial decisions and there is no reason to throw money into this pit of his. Your son sounds like he is either an idiot or a man with bad intentions.", "NTA. I understand your son\u2019s stress, but no, he can\u2019t take your daughter\u2019s future to make his better.", "NTA\n\nYou son is like \u201cI know you already gave me my money and I screwed it up, but give me sisters so I can screw that up for both of us.\u201d Smh the entitlement!", "NYA tour sounds sounds entitled. That many isn't owed to him at all and he is acting like a child", "NTA\nIt\u2019s one thing if he lost his job, but seeing as he lost his home as well, it\u2019s obvious he hasn\u2019t been making good life choices (saving money, finding a better job, or just any job). He\u2019s a married man in his 30s. He needs to grow up and figure out his own problems. His sister deserves the same gift of money that he and his brother got. Giving it to him again would be spitting in her face and very telling of who the favorite is. Good on you for sticking to your guns.", "NTA. Your son is not entitled to your daughter\u2019s money. He needs to find another option.", "Yep. He\u2019s not a little kid asking for help. He\u2019s a nearly middle aged man with a family who clearly has made some pretty bad life decisions. \nHis insisting that his little sister not get the same benefits he got because \u201che needs it more\u201d is assholery of the highest degree. \nFamily can look at how to help, but not at the cost of his sister\u2019s money. \nAlso when someone wants money more than they want help, that always raises red flags for me. \nNTA.", "She doesn't have a family. She is working but she has a minimum wage job and they can't afford to live with a single income", "No this is totally wrong to allow the son to guilt trip the sister directly like that. It is OP\u2019s money, and OPs gift to her.\n\nThe son is just being completely entitled in trying to redirect somebody else\u2019s gift.\n\nWhere OP went wrong was in telling the son he had the money tagged for the daughter. He should have just kept it simple \u2018No, don\u2019t, I already gave you money for a house and I don\u2019t have any more for you \u201c", "It says in the post the daughter isn't willing to part with the money either, so it sounds like at the least, OP asked", "Depending on where you live he can file for EI, and for the house if they own & not lease they could refinance or get loans temporarily. Sucks but they landed themselves in that predicament. If you wanna help them financially go for it but don't compromise your daughter's future, your son should understand that this is apart of adulthood and life sucks."]}
