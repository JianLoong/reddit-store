It\u2019s not my favorite dynamic because I\u2019m very clearly third wheeling, but I\u2019ve gotten used to it and have come to even enjoy it. \n\nNow, here\u2019s some context on me and my emotional state lately. I have been seeing this guy for a few months and I really, really liked him, which is a big deal for me. It takes a lot for me to open myself up to someone, as I\u2019ve been a bit emotionally closed off since my last relationship. However, a few dates ago - he gave me the whole, \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a relationship\u201d speech. This is not what I was looking for, so it was with a heavy heart that I decided I needed to end it with him. However, doing so became nearly impossible, because every time I tried meeting with him in person, I would fold \u2014 this is how much I liked him. It didn\u2019t help that I almost had a panic attack every time I was about to go talk to him (I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder). So, I decided at this point I should just rip the bandaid off and text him what I was going to say.\n\nThis brings us to last night. I asked Jamie if her and Mark wanted to go out with me because I wanted to send the text and then immediately distract myself. When we were pregaming, I sent the text and immediately started crying. So, I clearly wasn\u2019t in a good emotional state and they knew this. I gave Jamie my phone and told them both that I really needed their support tonight, and they agreed.\n\nNot so unexpectedly, when we went out I got pretty drunk and so did they. However, at one point - they both disappeared. I texted her a bunch of times and she said she was coming, just outside because Mark was smoking and she didn\u2019t want to leave him by himself. Over half an hour went by and I was getting scared, I was alone and drunk in a bar that I wasn\u2019t familiar with and I started texting her frantically to come back. Not only did I not feel safe, I felt abandoned on a night when I really just didn\u2019t want to be alone. She finally texted back very plainly, \u201cWell, we just broke up. so\u2026\u201d\n\nIn that moment, I know I should\u2019ve expressed more sympathy but I was so freaked out I told her to come back inside and we can talk about it. She said she was, just crossing the street. Another 20 minutes by and I started texting her more aggressively because, at this point in my drunken state, I was pissed. She finally said, \u201cMark has called 4-5 rides and he\u2019s honestly sick of it like I don\u2019t want to leave him and he will leave me if I don\u2019t join him,\u201d and just like that - she left with him and I was officially alone.\n\nI ended up texting her very angry things about leaving me and she was responding very defensively and angrily. I went home alone and when I woke up this morning, I read over our texts again. Now I\u2019m wondering, AITA for not being more sympathetic about her breakup and instead getting mad at her when she was probably going through a lot?\n\nEDIT: Idk if this makes a difference or not but just thought I\u2019d add it doesn\u2019t look like the breakup stuck? I checked her location this morning and she\u2019s been at his place the entire time. Haven\u2019t heard anything from her yet\n\nEDIT 2: Idk why I didn\u2019t mention this earlier because it\u2019s probably an important detail - she\u2019s also my roommate, so I was 100% expecting to be going home with her.", "created_utc": 1684682026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nxjpm/aita_for_yelling_at_my_best_friend_for_leaving_me/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
