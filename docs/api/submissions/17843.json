{"id": 17843, "submission_id": "13nxjpm", "title": "AITA for yelling at my best friend for leaving me at a bar after her and her BF broke up?", "selftext": "I (23F) often go out with my best friend, Jamie (24F) and her boyfriend, Mark (28M). It\u2019s not my favorite dynamic because I\u2019m very clearly third wheeling, but I\u2019ve gotten used to it and have come to even enjoy it. \n\nNow, here\u2019s some context on me and my emotional state lately. I have been seeing this guy for a few months and I really, really liked him, which is a big deal for me. It takes a lot for me to open myself up to someone, as I\u2019ve been a bit emotionally closed off since my last relationship. However, a few dates ago - he gave me the whole, \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a relationship\u201d speech. This is not what I was looking for, so it was with a heavy heart that I decided I needed to end it with him. However, doing so became nearly impossible, because every time I tried meeting with him in person, I would fold \u2014 this is how much I liked him. It didn\u2019t help that I almost had a panic attack every time I was about to go talk to him (I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder). So, I decided at this point I should just rip the bandaid off and text him what I was going to say.\n\nThis brings us to last night. I asked Jamie if her and Mark wanted to go out with me because I wanted to send the text and then immediately distract myself. When we were pregaming, I sent the text and immediately started crying. So, I clearly wasn\u2019t in a good emotional state and they knew this. I gave Jamie my phone and told them both that I really needed their support tonight, and they agreed.\n\nNot so unexpectedly, when we went out I got pretty drunk and so did they. However, at one point - they both disappeared. I texted her a bunch of times and she said she was coming, just outside because Mark was smoking and she didn\u2019t want to leave him by himself. Over half an hour went by and I was getting scared, I was alone and drunk in a bar that I wasn\u2019t familiar with and I started texting her frantically to come back. Not only did I not feel safe, I felt abandoned on a night when I really just didn\u2019t want to be alone. She finally texted back very plainly, \u201cWell, we just broke up. so\u2026\u201d\n\nIn that moment, I know I should\u2019ve expressed more sympathy but I was so freaked out I told her to come back inside and we can talk about it. She said she was, just crossing the street. Another 20 minutes by and I started texting her more aggressively because, at this point in my drunken state, I was pissed. She finally said, \u201cMark has called 4-5 rides and he\u2019s honestly sick of it like I don\u2019t want to leave him and he will leave me if I don\u2019t join him,\u201d and just like that - she left with him and I was officially alone.\n\nI ended up texting her very angry things about leaving me and she was responding very defensively and angrily. I went home alone and when I woke up this morning, I read over our texts again. Now I\u2019m wondering, AITA for not being more sympathetic about her breakup and instead getting mad at her when she was probably going through a lot?\n\nEDIT: Idk if this makes a difference or not but just thought I\u2019d add it doesn\u2019t look like the breakup stuck? I checked her location this morning and she\u2019s been at his place the entire time.

Alcohol is a depressant. \u201cSupporting you\u201d at a bar when you\u2019re sad and drinking a lot doesn\u2019t sound like a fun night out for your friends either. You shouldn\u2019t drink to the point where you\u2019re scared and worried about your safety getting home. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it was rude of them to leave you without warning since you all arrived together, and if they knew you were really wasted they should have made sure you were OK. If you decided to quit being friends with them because of that, it would be justified. I just don\u2019t think angrily/drunkenly texting things you now regret was the right way to handle the situation either.", "To be honest, I think both of you were somewhat the A here. Clearly you both need eachother but both were not able to be there for the other, because you both some bjg issue to deal with. \n\nMy advice would be to try and meet up with her, support eachother because both of you could use the company.", "INFO: if you gave jamie your phone then how did you text her?", "Nta but be cautious of this so called friend anything could have happened to you and she left you because of a drunk argument w/her bf.. not someone I\u2019d put much trust in", "Nta\n\nHonestly upset or not who leaves their friend behind and goes home with the boyfriend she claims she just broke up with? \n\nSounds more like they only had a fight tbh. \n\nYou were understandably panicking (drunk combined with being in an unfamiliar place alone while already in a bad mental space is likely to put anyone on edge) and your friend decided to leave you knowing you're already freaking out. \nI'm not even sure I could leave my worst enemy in that position without at least making sure they could get home safe first. \n\nThey could have told you they wanted to leave, but I do have to ask. It sounds like they were just outside the bar you were at, and they told you that. Why did you not just go outside to meet them?", "Nah, maybe next time, make it a girls' night out? I understand they were arguing, but they shouldn't have left you alone like that.", "NTA    you don't ditch a drunk friend at a bar.", "So what did the dude reply?\n\n(Sorry, got kind of invested)", "I understand that she is also going through a breakup but she also broke rule 1 of friend code.

It's really unfortunate that all this happened on the same night. I can understand why your friend felt the need to leave, but the responsible thing they SHOULD have done was arrange a ride for you to go home or make sure that you got home safely.

You sound too broken to be going to bars.  Get some therapy and stop being so dramatic.", "This is correct. Op and her friend are going through similar feelings.", "This is great advice, thank you!", "I asked for it back later in the night because I was getting anxious about his response", "Thank you, yeah, it does seem like it was more of a fight - this has happened once or twice between them. :/\n\nThat\u2019s a fair question! I was looking out the bar window for them and couldn\u2019t see them, so either they were lying about where they were or I just couldn\u2019t find them. It was also raining so I didn\u2019t want to physically leave and wander the sidewalk myself without knowing for sure they were where they said they were", "Honestly I would\u2019ve preferred a girls\u2019 night out!
