I'll understand if you don't want to visit here when he's home again, to protect yourself from his bad behaviors.

I should have protected you from him, years and years ago.\" \n\n**The message she sent is DARVO**:  deny, attack, reverse victim and offender.  It's how the manipulators flip the situation into making the victim apologize to their offender.

And **the visit would still have been ruined for your BF and for you.**  When you called out the abuser, his mother claims that ruined the visit.  She's not seeing it as ruining the visit for the two of you, but for the two of them.  Her husband didn't get to continue his abuse.  She didn't get to continue her pretense that his words were fine and not damaging her son.  You didn't ruin the visit.  You ripped the blinders off the pretense of her fantasy of playing happy family, while she ignores the abuse that happens right in front of her.  **She's enabling his abusive behaviors to her own son.  And now, she's enabling the abuse further, by DARVOing who gets blamed.**  \n\nA reasonable response to his mother's message might be:  \"**Mom, the visit was ruined when your husband spoke about me and to me the way he did.  HE ruined the visit, not OP.**  I hope you are able to see this.  When he's ready to give a real apology for his behavior, one that includes how he's changing his behavior for the future, I'll be able to visit at your home again.  Until then, **I will not be visiting where he is.**  So, if you want to meet us, alone, at a local restaurant for future visits, I can do that.

I'm very sorry that he was put in this situation \ud83d\ude14 I wish you both good luck and good life!\n\nEdit: Forgot NTA", "Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see the other parent is bad when the one is so, so bad", "NTA. Keep supporting your young man and help him heal from the abuse from his stepfather and the lack of protection and support from his mom. What you said desperately needed to be said, and maybe heard by the half siblings. Try to encourage him to only see his mom alone, without the stepfather, and completely cut off the stepfather. If he has a good relationship with his half siblings, make sure he keeps in touch with them, but without the stepfather.", "Nothing to be sorry about, honestly this family needed a good reality check. And you don't have to apologize with his mother for doing what she should have done a long time ago, standing up for her son.", "Probably because mom went against her and stuck up for husband", "> I bet you tell people to be nice.\n\nI wish.  In my personal life, I've used this quote a couple of times for justification https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbfMkh940Q", "Hilarious, software developers make very good money, I won\u2019t even get into stock and other things, and they don\u2019t graduate with hundreds of thousands in student loans.  He\u2019s a fool in addition to being a complete AH, thank goodness someone shut him down for once.  And FYI, completely agree, letting your kid get abused doesn\u2019t not make you a nice person, completely the opposite", "I disagree.  I do think therapy could help him, but so can she.. Just in different ways.\n\nThis man having someone stick up for him in a way his mother never did probably helped him in a serious way.

He's so used to that behavior that it doesn't phase or bother him as much anymore.  And it should.  Ur nta and fiance nta.  Step-dad is an absolute jerk", "NTA\n\nKudos on you for standing up for someone you care about. People who lift themselves up by belittling others should be shut down asap.\n\n> Well anyway he's in college now and is studying to be a programmer.\n\nUnsolicited, unrelated comment. I would recommend he make sure to take some courses focused on \"software development\", not just programming. Learning how to \n\n- Plan a project\n- Lead others in working on it\n- Understand what your \"client\" needs, vs what they're asking for (client can mean external customer or even your own manager)\n\nThere are all good things to know and **very** helpful in moving up an organization (up can still mean writing software; it doesn't need to mean management).

Not all bio moms in that situation have their kid's back to the extent needed.", "I'd be really careful about fighting someone else's battles for them. When this happened it sounds like your fianc\u00e9 just sat there silently and didn't stick up for himself. What did he say to his mother when she messaged him later? Did he defend you? Do you have issues with co-dependency or enmeshment? \n\nYou're NTA but I think you and your fianc\u00e9 could use some couples therapy for this stuff because looks like he's passive and found someone else to control his life for him and he's gonna turn around and resent you one day if he doesn't learn how to stick up for himself now so you both are a team.", "NTA.", "NTA!\n\nOP is amazing and her fianc\u00e9 is lucky to have her!", "Putting down your son's soon yo be profession is rude, but when is step-dad going to be apologizing for that? \n\nYou did the right thing standing up for your BF. Just to be petty though, I would tell them you'd be glad to apologize for your comments as soon as he apologizes to your BF. It would be painful for stepdad to do so - just what he deserves", "Excuse me? Your fiance is studying to be a programmer? His step dad is nuts if he doesn't see the value in that. Every field uses programmers' work. His precious law career as well. NTA", "NTA\n\nThe biggest AH in this story is his mom ..she knew how toxic he was to your fiance still she enabled that emotional and verbal abuse all his life\n\nHe could've had a better life with the grandmother but again the mom sided with the abuser and didn't let OP have a good life\n\nI hope in his therapy he starts to realise that his mother is actually the worst of the lot and LC is the way to go", "NTA. You 100% did the right thing.", "NTA - Thank you for standing up for your fianc\u00e9.  Hopefully someday he will realize his mother is just enabling that bullshit behavior.  Outstanding job!!!", "I mean, you're generally not supposed to insult people in their own home, but it really sounds like he deserved it lol. I'd say NTA, but you may have to bend the knee and apologize to keep the peace if your fiance wants to maintain a relationship with his family. Hopefully he doesn't because they seem awful, and yes that includes his enabling mother.", "NTA. You defended him, something his mother seemingly hasn't done in a long, long time. The fact that he was so resigned to take that verbal abuse speaks volume about how his life with those two have been, and he's lucky to have someone who loves him enough to do that for him", "You were ABSOLUTELY rude and justified in your rudeness.  Sometimes it\u2019s all people understand. Ohh and NTA", "Nta what is the point of being in contact with them", "NTA", "Nah you weren't rude enough. You go girl!", "NTA also, he's not as smart as he thinks he is to make a comment like that.

And you are right, mom definitely sucks!", "NTA but his step dad is a huge one and his mum isn\u2019t much better if she\u2019s defending the behaviour in any way, he would be better off with both of them out of his life.", "NTA. Good for you for saying something since obviously no one else ever does. I'm glad your fiance felt supported.", "NTA - you did exactly what you should do. Stand up to A-Holes and let them know that they are wrong.", "NTA! You showed your fiance that he has someone jn his corner finally. You stood up to an over earing abusive man and your fiance was thankful \u2764\ufe0f forget the rest", "Fuck his stepdad, youre a hero. Programming is hard work and without guys like your husband my beloved hobby wouldnt exist. Good on you!", "Well\u2026you might have been a wee more diplomatic.  When we allow others to determine how we act and feel we are giving them far more power over us than we should.  If your fiance doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with them he should probably keep in touch with mom and distance himself from the rest.  As a person who grew up in abuse I can definitely relate to seeing the mother as an \u2018enabler\u2019 for not stepping in\u2026but\u2026there is a very real and powerful self-preservation sense that often keeps emotionally damaged people from purposefully exposing themselves to more emotional abuse.  Don\u2019t be too hard on her.  Encourage her to be stronger.\nYNTA.  But next time, think about what will probably happen in advance and prepare yourself to unemotionally speak your mind without losing control of your emotions.  As a lawyer he is used to poking at people until they lose control and reveal more information than they would otherwise.  For him this is entertainment.  He is manipulating you and his own children in order to feel more powerful himself.  He is emotionally corrupt.  Don\u2019t give him the advantage.  Plan ahead and be cool and direct.  Don\u2019t walk away because to him\u2026that\u2019s as good as a win and he will never let you forget he is superior to you.  Try instead to force him to respond to conversation about what you know more about.  It will set him off balance and poke at his self worth.  Stand strong, look for what bugs him and try to set him off balance without emotional outbursts.  Take charge of your conversations and be prepared for him to be ugly in return.", "  NTA. You\u2019re a keeper.", "NTA . You\u2019re a great partner!! I hope your finance goes no contact with his mother. She was a shit parent and failed as one . I hope your fianc\u00e9 realizes that he\u2019s better off without these people in his life. Family should build you up not tear you down .

You were just right! \nBrilliant clap back. You're a great partner.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nyou were 100% on the right for standing up to your fiance\n\nhe should try to go LC on his family,since step-dad is an AH and his mom is a minor AH for enabling this behavior and be on step-dad's side in the aftermath", "NTA\n\nThe step dad was rude for disrespecting your fianc\u00e9 and he ruined the day.", "NTA at all. For serial. I've been in a similar situation and then called psychotic after the fact. Every now and then my brain makes me relive it and have an inkling of being embarrassed or unsure of myself, but nah friend. We are the ones in the right for sure. These grown ass men can't keep behaving this way.", "Honestly you were much more polite then I would've been. He's acting like a 5th grade bully constantly comparing to make someone feel small. Ill never understand why we condemn bullying in kids but just let it slide when it's adult.

But A senior in high school cannot to directly to law school. I want to say you are Nta.

You\u2019re a good partner.", "NTA at all, I was in a relationship similar except we lived with my partners parents and it was constant be little my to the point that my partner even started agreeing with them, if my partner had done even an ounce of what you did I wouldn\u2019t have the damage I have now", "NTA sounds like your fianc\u00e9 finally has someone who loves and supports him.", "NTA. As sad as this is, it is a good thing you know and experience the dynamic now so you know what the road ahead looks like.  I don\u2019t know that his family will likely change their behavior, but it doesn\u2019t mean you or your fianc\u00e9 have to stand for it.", "Bravo!", "NTA. Step-dad ruined the day. He could\u2019ve praised his daughter without dinging your fianc\u00e9. He just mad he exists. Good for you.", "Most definitely NTA. Your partner needs to sit down with his mother and explain what her enabling of her husbands abusive behaviour towards him is doing to him and their relationship.\n\nI'm with you, people that turn a blind eye to abuse to keep the peace are not nice people. They're weak, selfish and morally bankrupt.", "NTA. Stan me by your man. \n\nWhere are you that someone can go to law school after high school? In the US, law school is graduate school.
