I'll understand if you don't want to visit here when he's home again, to protect yourself from his bad behaviors.  No one should have to hear such horrible meanness aimed at them, like he did to you.  In the future, let's meet up at Restaurant instead, without him, and I will pay for it.  I should have protected you from him, years and years ago.\" \n\n**The message she sent is DARVO**:  deny, attack, reverse victim and offender.  It's how the manipulators flip the situation into making the victim apologize to their offender.   His mother **blaming you for disrespecting her husband, who just spent the visit** being abusive and manipulative to your BF, **totally disrespecting your BF,** is DARVOing.   \n\n**His mother blaming you for \"ruining\" the visit, is DARVOing.

And **the visit would still have been ruined for your BF and for you.**  When you called out the abuser, his mother claims that ruined the visit.  She's not seeing it as ruining the visit for the two of you, but for the two of them.  Her husband didn't get to continue his abuse.  She didn't get to continue her pretense that his words were fine and not damaging her son.  You didn't ruin the visit.  You ripped the blinders off the pretense of her fantasy of playing happy family, while she ignores the abuse that happens right in front of her.  **She's enabling his abusive behaviors to her own son.  And now, she's enabling the abuse further, by DARVOing who gets blamed.**  \n\nA reasonable response to his mother's message might be:  \"**Mom, the visit was ruined when your husband spoke about me and to me the way he did.  HE ruined the visit, not OP.**  I hope you are able to see this.  When he's ready to give a real apology for his behavior, one that includes how he's changing his behavior for the future, I'll be able to visit at your home again.  Until then, **I will not be visiting where he is.**  So, if you want to meet us, alone, at a local restaurant for future visits, I can do that.

I remember in child psychology, biological parents are seen as a fixed fact of their lives, so if there's abuse the child can't fathom swapping out their parents, and can't fathom parents being anything wrong, so they blame themselves for abuse. They'd rather see themselves as wrong than their parents. That's how far that goes.\n\nDon't try to paint his mother as black and white, completely unforgivably toxic, as he still loves her. Instead, divide up her actions so it's easier to swallow.

Don't do boundaries with \"you can't/shouldn't\", because they obviously can and did.\n\nBeing able to still have access to someone he loves without fear of her enabling side might be a good compromise.\n\nBut it's unlikely she'll respect them, as she's shown preference to stepdad over him already. Maybe it's just never been made clear to her before the damage she's doing both to her kid, and their ongoing relationship, with the options she picks. The implied choices she's making about what she values; she cares more about her partner's opinion than doing the right thing by her son.\n\nStepdad does sound like a lost cause, though, like he sees him as an unfortunate tagalong to \"getting the girl\" right from the start. Sometimes, boundaries do get respected and the person gets respected with them, and later fault is admitted when the relationship has been cordial for a while.
