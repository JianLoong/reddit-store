From what my fiance has told me, his mother was very lovely but his step dad was a total AH.

Their relationship is not good and it's all his step father's fault, he never tried to be a parent for him and hated having to keep him in the house (my fiance's grandmother told me this). When he was a teen everything was an issue, from his hobbies to friends, anything he did was wrong. \n\nWell anyway he's in college now and is studying to be a programmer. He's doing great.

He arrived just a little before lunch was served. \n\nAfter eating we were hanging out in the living room when fiance's mom asked him about college. He started talking about his grades, his classes and other school related stuff. His step father asked his sister who's a senior in high school if she had been studying. She said she did and he said great because she needs to be ahead foe next year. He then explained that his daughter was getting ready because she'll go into law school next year (he's a lawyer too) and then he said the comment that made me snap. He told my fiance that law school was hard and been good at it is something to brag about because everyone can play videogames all day but not everyone can graduate from a serious career (he literally said this). I looked over at my fiance and he was sad, he didn't said anything but I know him. So I snapped. I told him that if he thought that studying programming was playing videogames all day then he was far more ignorant that I thought he was. I originally planned to stop it there but then I got caught up in the moment and also told him that he was an asshole for dragging my fiance down on purpose. I also told him that he must have a miserable life if he's so focused on causing pain on others.

I made sure that he knows I support and love him. \n\nHowever he got a message later from his mother about how rude I was for disrespecting his step dad and how I ruined the day.

You are a great partner. He should consider limiting contact with his mother for her role in all of this. Just remember on that end you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. He's gonna have to havethe realization mom's a toxic enabler who seemingly cares more about her new family than her son.", "NTA. His stepdad & his mom are the AH. Everything you said is accurate. He\u2019s lucky to have you!", "NTA\n\nIt's deeply disturbing that his mother thinks that you ruined the day, while she accepted her husbad behaviour as something normal. It may be the biggest problem because if she gives your fiance an ultimatum he may break and submit to her demands. You won't win with his stepfather shadow without destroying the mother influence.", "NTA\n\nHis stepdad sounds completely vile. Good on you for standing up to the asshat. However, your fianc\u00e9 needs to learn to stand up for himself. Therapy might be beneficial for him, and he truly needs to go LC or NC with his mother. It\u2019s obvious his mom prioritizes the stepdad over him, so for his mental health he needs as little contact as possible. If that means they don\u2019t come to your wedding, so be it. I truly don\u2019t think they deserve that honor.", "NTA and if you are in the US no one goes straight from high school to law school. You have to graduate from college first, so the stepdad is also an idiot.", "NTA. We need more people like you in the world.", "NTA. I firmly believe people like his stepdad need to be called out just the way you called him out. \n\nThey are far too used to spouting whatever BS they want and having nobody challenge them.", "NTA- You did great!!", "i don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for what you did. you stepped up for your partner and for what\u2019s right tbh. the only thing you could\u2019ve done better was being calmer about it and avoided name calling, but regardless i think you did the right thing/you\u2019re nta :)", "Were you rude? Yes, you were but you are NTA. Rudeness was called for in the situation as it seems to be the only language his SF understands. His mother should be ashamed that she jumps to her husband's defense, but has never once done the same for her child who needed it more. It was her job to protect him.", "NTA. To be fair, you weren't exactly polite, but then again there is a time and a place for everything, and politeness would in this case have been out of place and time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And yes, his mother let him down by letting her husband mock her child & she and her husband are big A's.\n\nAnd your fiance must understand by himself that his mother is just as guilty. It will be hard but he could do this, especially seeing how a healthy family relationship should be. Your fiance is lucky to have you!", "To the hive-mind - *Downvotes are on the left!*\n\nYTA - Although it might feel good now for your fiance and you, it just delays a real long term solution (that I assume both of you want).\n\nHe need to learn how to cope/manage his feelings towards his stepfather (and his mother related to his husband. And his step-siblings?) and how it impacted his childhood.  (I'm not saying how he should do this)  You stepping into this like this muddles the picture.  \n\n>  how rude I was for disrespecting his step dad and how I ruined the day.\n\nNotice it wasn't about your stepfather's actions nor the content of what you said, which is the main issue and was an opportunity to address it.  Just that *you* were X and *you* spoiled Y.  Any opportunity to avoid blame/responsiblity/\"I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror\". And this is from his mother who he thinks is \"very lovely\".\n\nYou want to support your fiance and help him, not add to the complexity.  You won the battle, but I'm not sure how it helps with the war.\n\nI hope it turns out well for both of you.", "NTA. His stepfather was going out of his way to humiliate your fiance, and for no good reason other than the (apparent) pleasure he gets from humiliating him.\n\nAnd you're right - computer science is not an easy major at all, and does not involve any video gaming whatsoever.", "He needs to go no contact with his pathetic family. \nHis mother is the WORST type of person....she chose a loser of a husband over her child.", "NTA You already know you did right by your fianc\u00e9", "NTA w wife, hope you guys a have a great future together", "NTA and this is where I\u2019d respond if she\u2019d been a good mother and protected her child from the bully she married you wouldn\u2019t have to. Then if block them all and go NC. I didn\u2019t see one member of his family worth a damn to keep in his life and he needs to know that.", "NTA - You are my hero", "NTA.  I want to hug you!!!  I had a really bad stepfather myself.  He would say things like \"You're not worth the powder to blow you up.\"", "NTA. Easier for his mum to call you rude than to admit that she should have stood up for her son herself a long time ago", "So, yes, you threw a bomb into \"the day,\" but the day was only even surface-nice because your fianc\u00e9 sat there silently while his stepdad heaped shit on him.\n\nYou're right about his mom. She's an enabler.\n\nNTA", "Bravo! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f. NTA, OP, and way  to go, standing up for your man against a very clear AH!!!  You\u2019re right, too, that his mother is just as much to blame for never standing up for her son against an adult bully.", "We spoke about this, I have an opinion but he can't change his feelings for his own mother in a moment, I think he might realize later in life how his mother allowed his step dad to hurt him, but as for now he only sees her as the loving mother she was to him. I can't tell him how to feel, only support him and make him as happy as possible", "I'm lucky to have him as well, he's the sweetest boy I've ever met!", "He has anxiety so it's hard for him to stand up for himself sometimes, and I think growing up in that environment was not helping either, sadly he's used to his step dad telling him hurtful stuff and just keep quiet. \n\nHe loves his mother, I think there's no rationality regarding feelings, maybe some day he'll realize what his mom allowed and why she's as bad as his step dad, but it's a hard step for him.", "Oh I see, I'm not in the US so here you can go straight from HS go law school, you have to pass an admission test and that's why she's already studying", "\\^\\^\\^\\^ This!", "I got quite angry and that's why I think maybe I was too rude, definitely could have being calmer but I got caught up in the heat of the moment \ud83d\ude48", "His grandmother is very sweet, she tried to take him to live with her but his mother didn't allowed it. She tried pressing charges for being neglectful when he was kid but she wasn't taken serious sadly", "You sound like you're doing an awesome job. Maybe slyly help push him to the conclusion. Either way you sound like you're looking out for your partner. That's awesome.", "Hence why I believe he needs therapy. \n\nVirtual hugs to both of you!", "completely understandable ofc! you\u2019re human and the way we act in heated moments is typically never perfect. all things considered, it sounds like you handled things very well and you were brave for calling out the behavior! saying all that in front of your partner\u2019s family can be super intimidating!", "Oh I completely skipped over that bit in your comment I'm sorry! He's doing therapy, he started about a year ago (he was a bit unsure at first but he gave it a try anyway), it's working for him, but after so many years it's hard for him, I hope he continues getting better\n\n\nVirtual hugs for you too!", "I hope he continues getting better too. He deserves to be happy, and feel loved. \n\nHis stepfather might be vile, but his mother obviously has never stood up for her child so she is just as much (if not more) at fault in all of this."]}
