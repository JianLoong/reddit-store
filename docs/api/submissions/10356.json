I wake him up and tell him he\u2019s peed the bed, and I guess he was still asleep or confused as he didn\u2019t acknowledge it for a few mins and then just said \u2018well what do you want me to do about it?\u2019 Errr, maybe clean it up?\nIn the eve I change the sheets and he flips the mattress. We go back to sleep and I once again wake up to find him tinkling on my leg!! At this point I\u2019m very pissed off. I\u2019m so tired and how both sides of my mattress are covered in pee and two loads of my bed covers. He again doesn\u2019t really say much and is like \u2018it\u2019s done now what do you want me to do about it\u2019. I\u2019m very upset at this point and he starts asking why I\u2019m so mad, that he\u2019s sorry and embarrassed but that\u2019s it.\n\nAnyway, I change my bedding AGAIN and now I basically tell him he can\u2019t do it again, he says he can\u2019t promise it so I tell him to go home. He offered to come back and help me clean today but honestly I just don\u2019t want him over. Btw this has never happened before with me and I asked him and he said it happens rarely to him but it does happen\n\nSo AITA for kicking him out? He technically was asleep and drunk and has apologised but his lack of trying to help me clean or really any accountability is upsetting.\n\nUpdate: he\u2019s buying me a new mattress and getting the other one picked up.

They are cheaper than new mattresses.\n\nI have basically been here, I am with you on this and over this entire behavior pattern. People need to quit drinking to excess.

Alcoholism isn\u2019t just having to drink everyday, it goes beyond that. Drinking even occasionally but having no control and drinking to excess every time, literally to the point where you become incontinent, is also alcoholism. If your BF doesn\u2019t get some help and get this controlled, this will get much worse. And it can get dangerous for you. \n\nThis is where tough love by you needs to come in.

He will even open your drawers and pee on your clothes (if he hasn\u2019t already) and pee in your closets etc. alcohol related incontinence is more frequent in men (it can happen to women as well tho) if he has a past of sleepwalking (childhood sleepwalking) then that\u2019s a red flag when paired with heavy drinking. With men, the fact that they usually stand when peeing\u2026it takes more brain activity (which they are lacking in their drunken slumber) they walk to the bathroom, have to raise a seat (usually) aim and go. However, when in a confused drunken state of awakening, anything may seem like a toilet lid. Drawers, cupboards etc. you get my drift lol. When we drink it affects our sleep. You do not get restful sleep when drunk, no REM. So, he is peeing the bed (and probably in places you don\u2019t know about yet but you\u2019ll find them eventually) because his drunk brain thinks he\u2019s in the bathroom! Alcohol fills up the bladder and organs are trying to filter out the toxins so more urination. More urination with the frequent microawakenings due to lack of REAL SLEEP, causes these accidents. Him being narcissistic and brushing it off like it\u2019s no big deal is the combination of embarrassment and not wanting to quit drinking alcohol. RED FLAG!!! He needs to go after he gets you a new mattress. If you don\u2019t break it off you will have resentment towards him and yourself!

You need to ask yourself if he doesn't appear drunk enough to end up peeing the bed how much could he drink without you really noticing any significant change in his behaviour.

Buy a mattress cover everyone!", "I'm sure you realize that, but a lot of people don't think it's disgusting when that happens during sex.

I wish my mom hadn\u2019t used up my entire childhood and young adulthood learning that. If getting to the point of admitting this is a problem is this much of a struggle for him, what do you think the long hard road to recovery is going to look like?

It\u2019s calculated in g/ml of blood I think. \n\nIn most of America, the legal limit for driving is 0.08. If that was your BAC, then your blood would be 0.08% alcohol. At a certain point, alcohol poisoning becomes lethal. Alcoholics have a higher tolerance, and can appear merely drunk at a BAC that would literally kill someone who rarely drinks. \n\nI\u2019ve known a lot of people who have struggled with alcohol, including my ex and he NEVER wet the bed. This is not normal. Your bf needs to get checked by a doctor and be honest about his alcohol conception and seek psychological treatment.", "Sending him home was perfectly acceptable.

And giving him an ultimatum isn\u2019t going to work. \nMy fianc\u00e9 is addicted to alcohol, and it\u2019s one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever dealt with. From my experience, there is nothing that you can say or do that is going to get him to stop drinking. For your own safety, never try to argue or have a discussion with him about his drinking when he\u2019s been drinking (any amount of alcohol at all). The best possible thing you can do is remove yourself from the situation and follow up with him again when he\u2019s sober. In most cases, when someone is addicted the only thing that is going to get them to think about working on it is hitting rock bottom. You need to decide if that\u2019s something you\u2019re going to want to deal with. From your post, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s anywhere close to rock bottom and things *will* continue to get worse. Giving an ultimatum will likely just lead to him just lying to you about his alcohol consumption. \nLoving someone with an addiction is really, really hard. It\u2019s really up to you whether or not you want to continue a relationship with him, but I want you to know that it\u2019s not going to get easier any time soon. I also want you to know that it\u2019s not personal. When my partner slips up and drinks, it\u2019s so hard not to feel like he\u2019s choosing alcohol over me and our relationship. But that\u2019s not the case. Addiction is super messed up. I really recommend looking into the friends and family meetings at Al Anon. It can help you not feel so alone and give you some great tools for how to handle things. And always set clear, strong boundaries and enforce them. \nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. I know first hand how difficult it can be. It\u2019s easy to lose yourself in trying to help him, so please remember that only he can be the one to decide to stop drinking and get help. Take care of yourself.", "also buy a mattress protector", "Are you sure this is completely necessary?", "I mean it's a kitten, so yes to being one of the coolest cats. \ud83d\ude05"]}
