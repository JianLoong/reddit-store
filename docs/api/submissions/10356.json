I had to check the boyfriend's age because YEARS ago I dated a guy who would get drunk and pee the bed. It happened at my house once, I had a plastic liner to save the mattress, but insisted on him cleaning and buying me new sheets. It then happened at his place, and I left in the middle of the night because I was so disgusted. I broke up with him pretty shortly after that incident, and he freaked out and spread rumors about me and posted really nasty stuff online. Get out, stay out.", "NTA.  Some people piss themselves when they are drunk.  Or pee in weird places, not the bathroom.  It is something they can control by not getting drunk.", "NTA. Why are you with this guy? I\u2019ve never gotten so drunk I\u2019ve pissed myself, let alone at 32 years old. Dude is a grown ass man.", "NTA.  How gross!!!  If he's pissed twice in the bed how could you ever sleep with him again?  Kick him permanently.", "Get boyfriend to replace mattress, then replace boyfriend. He's 32 and still trying to relive his college days, apparently, which is bad news.

Will a 32-year-old woman put up with a DIY water bed every night? Maybe, but it's a lot more likely a younger women who's been dating him since she was 22? 20? would. \n\nYou can do better OP.

OP, make him buy you a new bed and dump his grown child ass. Irresponsible drinking above the age of like, idk, 25 is such an 'ick'.

I'm a heavy drinker sometimes, and even when I go to bed, stumbling drunk, I still get up to pee if I need to. This guy is either blackout drunk, or he just doesn't give a shit about his girlfriend.\n\nThis one incident doesn't necessarily define him, but I hope OP realizes that it's a red flag. There are certain people who consistently fuck up in life and act like it's no big deal because they know they'll make up for it later.
