This always ended up very one sided with me needing to bring her with me when she wanted to come, me needing to let her sleep in my room and sometimes my bed when she had bad dreams, me missing out on a field trip because my sister fell sick that day and couldn't go on hers, me needing to take her to prom with me because she wanted to go. Stjfd like that is the norm for us. She adores me, no doubt about it. She considers us friends. But I do not think of her as a friend and I do not like her very much. She's very bad at being a friend (and not just to me), she's selfish and always want to do stuff she likes and doesn't take the time to do stuff other's want to do, even though she expects you to do her stuff. We don't have common interests either. \n\nFor years I complained to my parents about it how I felt like it was unfair that I had to prioritize my sister over my actual friends. They sent me to therapy and told me she's my best friend. They grounded me once because I told them my sister was not my friend and she wasn't doing anything for me yet I had to do stuff for her. This is why I moved out.\n\nMy sister told me she'll move in with me in two more years and she'll stay with me overnight sometimes. She asked about decorating her room at my place. She doesn't have a room. I told her as much. And I told her we would not be living together again and she was not allowed to spend the night. She asked why and said I ran away from home and she wanted to know why. I told her life will be very different now. She wanted to know if I would drive her to a Christmas fair her school is taking part in and I said no. I told her she couldn't use me anymore. She brought up staying overnight again and I made it very clear that would never happen and she cried and called me mean.

You are setting boundaries now that you\u2019re an adult.  Good for you.", "NTA. \n\nYour parents had a golden child and it wasn't you, is the essence of what I am getting from this post. Them telling you that \"sisters are friends\" was really just code for \"your sister gets whatever she wants and you can never complain about it ever.\" \n\nI understand 100% why you moved out. Keep reinforcing those boundaries. Your sister could've maybe been your friend had your parents not so clearly coddled and spoiled her at your expense, but that ship has sailed. \n\nI'm proud of you for seeing things as they are and doing what you needed to do to get out on your own. I wish you a lifetime of peace and happiness.", "NTA they just wanted free child care.", "NTA.\n\nNobody is going to put you first except for you. It\u2019s not your fault that your parents created your sister and her apparent inability to live in the real world and it\u2019s not your responsibility to coddle her at the cost of your boundaries and mental health.", "NTA but I would seriously consider sitting your sister down and explaining to her, in detail, why you feel the way you do. Your parents raised her to be reliant on you, it's what she expects because it's all she's ever known. She's old enough to understand your reasons, whether she's happy with them or not.", "NTA.  Your parents created this selfish girl and now they can deal with it.  Go live your own life and enjoy it.", "NTA\n\nYour sister doesnt understand because just as you've been raised to cater to her, she's been raised to expect it. She doesnt know anything else. Show her something else.\n\nYou can bask in your newfound freedom without cutting your family completely off. Remember, you have full autonomy now. You can dictate how much you'll do. You can end a conversation. You set the rules of your home. \n\nYou can train them all on how to deal with you.", "NTA. You have moved out and are now an independent adult who is free to choose who you want in your own living space.  If you can't live with your sister then you don't have to.  \n\nYou can always explain what you'd like to see more of in her, perhaps as she gets older she might change so you might want to be LC in case she does change.", "Leave and never look back. Best advice I can give.

You aren't even in the same residence!\n\nNTA", "NTA, and your parents are being abusive and neglectful parents trying to dump the sister on you when they can move her out.\n\nYou have your own life and responsibilities to take care of. They are her parents, not you.", "NTA - You did the right thing to block your parents.  Siblings are part of a biological lottery and you do not automatically have to \"love\" them and make them an appendange of yourself as your parents insisted on doing.  And look how that worked out--as soon as you were able to, you fled the scene and now what have they got? One kid won't talk with them and the other doesn't know how to function in the world on her own.  Stand your ground, this is a hill to die on.  You and your sister might be able to wor out some sort of an adult relationship later on, but that's not going to happen until she becomes her own person and quits hanging on you like some remora.  Your folks made this mess, now they need to clean it up.  I'm not quite sure I'd call it parentification, but it sure the hell wasn't healthy for either of you.", "NTA. But this isn\u2019t over. And it will probably get worse before it gets better. Prepare for an unannounced visit of your parents.", "NTA- you set a boundary to protect yourself and you are enforcing it. Good on you. \n\ninfo: did you give her an explanation about how her and your parent's conduct toward you made you feel when she asked why? Because I would say- if by \"mean\" you mean that I am no longer going to be a doormat for your inconsiderate treatment of me or for our parents to ignore my needs in favor of your wants- then hell yes, I'm a mean-ass mofo and you better get used to it- or don't- but you are never going to force anything on me ever again. I ran away from YOU. That is why I left. So, no, you will not be coming here.\n\nTo your parents, if they ever get around the block- You keep insisting that I am her friend, but what you mean is doormat.  She is not my friend and never has been. She uses me and treats me like garbage and you have done nothing but enable her which has created a mountain of resentment that even if she were to stop tomorrow and become an actual decent person- is unlikely to resolve anytime soon, so y'all better figure out your plan b for her.", "NTA.   So far from it.  You did what you had to do you can create a life of your own, not live one as your sisters care giver.  She won\u2019t have other friends probably because of how she acts, all enabled by your parents.  \n\nThis is the first time you\u2019ll probably truly be allowed to live for yourself.  Allowing any contact at all would make it so you might have to go back to that life.", "NTA. But also block her for a while. She will just keep messaging you.", "NTA\n\nHold your ground. Sister has some hard lessons to learn. It's not your responsibility to teach them. You may have to block her,too.", "NTA.\n\nHold your boundaries.  Don't back down now.  Otherwise, what was the point of moving out?  Enjoy your freedom, and don't forget to block her too.", "NTA. Your sister is exactly as your parent has raised her to be: she thinks Everything is about her, and that she is the star of every life out there.", "Don\u2019t share your keys and get a doorbell camera. I expect her to show up anyway. Your parents may even show up too. If they do, don\u2019t answer the door. \n\nSounds like your parents want an empty house. Conditioning you to take care of your sister includes her moving in with you asap. If you fold , she becomes your problem. \n\nKeep your boundaries solid. NTA", "NTA. Your parents are though.", "Nope, keep those boundaries strong. The situation isn't really her fault but it's time you had your own life. Fly free and stay strong, don't let them grind you down!", "NTA", "NTA, so far from the AH, your sister is spoiled and your parents are the AH here in this situation.", "NTA. Trying to force a relationship usually doesn\u2019t work and your sister is very needy. In time she may change. She\u2019s very young. Don\u2019t rule out a future relationship. People change.", "Good for you! NTA. Does your family know where you live though?", "\"Sis, once you turn 18, it is your turn to help ME! Remember, I did everything to help you for 16  years, at least I waited until you turned 18 to have the favors returned! It's gonna be so great! You're going to take me with you everywhere (bc you had to do that), you can cover all my gas and insurance (since she had to ruin all your fun stuff, now you're ruining hers), you can add me in to all of your work promotion celebrations (bc of prom)! It will be great getting my turn! Aren't you excited?!?!?\"", "NTA. I'm sorry your parents did this to you both. Unfortunately, she's just as much a victim of this BS as you are. You are not obligated to be your sister's friend. You aren't obligated to spend time with her ever.  She isn't owed anything from you. \n\nYour parents have set her up for some painful experiences coming up very soon in life. There comes a point when people are a lot less likely to put up with the kinds of manipulative behaviors your sister learned by having her very own a familial servant- sister. It's good for her to learn as many of those lessons as possible now, instead of when she was an adult. \n\nIf you are planning to continue a relationship with her, please continue to unvarnished honesty. Tell her: my relationship with our parents is very different than yours because of..., I have to set boundaries with you now because our parents didn't, I left because our parents treated you as a golden child and me as their SG/ babysitter, they manipulated and gaslit me into making me do everything you wanted, etc. Obviously, wait for the right topic of conversation to come up with each instance. \n\nThese won't always be comfortable conversations for her, but if she starts to displace blame, defend, etc, just remind her that the price of having a relationship is having these kinds of talks. \n\nMaybe by the time she moves out she'll be a better sister to you.", "Eh.... NTA but I have to be concerned about your sister. I'm really unable to gauge if your sister is selfish and entitled or legitimately adores and likes you. It seems like they treat you rather amiable, not just stealing from you or something but actually wanting to spend time with you or looking up to you?   \n\n\nI wouldn't punish your sister purely for what your parents did. You could still have a relationship with them, but one in which you set the boundaries and have your own terms. Or don't , you're an adult living your own life.

Continue laying those boundaries. You are your own person not a built in companion to your sister.", "NTA on principle, but as a person you don't sound super nice. Your sister adores you, she's only 16. Have you had a NICE grown up conversation with her, where you put up some boundaries and mention how you get hurt by her cos she doesn't want to do things you like, only what she likes that you don't like? \n\nI have two younger sisters, and yes they could be annoying at different stages of life but they grew into my best friends. You seem remarkably self centred.", "NTA for holding your ground, you\u2019re allowed to have your own space. Hopefully when she grows up more, if you continue on this path, you can have a normal balanced relationship. \n\nBut are you sure you want to block your parents and sister entirely? What you described is obviously negative and worth instating boundaries for sure. I don\u2019t know how toxic your home life was, but perhaps there\u2019s something salvageable in there?", "NTA. But I don't think they are truly AHs, either. Your parents tried to force a close relationship, & that was a mistake. Hopefully, after you've had some much-needed alone time & your sister matures, you'll get along better & not resent her so much. She considers you her best friend, from the sound of it, & she probably doesn't realize how much you didn't like not having a choice about bringing her along everywhere. She's spoiled, but a little time & maturity will help that. She lives you - don't forget that. \n\nAll these people commenting hateful things about your parents probably haven't been parents. This is a cruel world, & having a family who has your back is a good thing. Your parents tried hard to build that loyal bond between you, but they took it too far. That doesn't mean they were bad or using you, but they should have let you fight & do separate things. \n\nI hope you can find a healthy, unoppressive level of involvement with your family.", "NTA. It might be worth trying to establish a relationship with your sister outside of your parents since they seem to be the root cause of alot of the problems but some distance and honestly might really help overall", "NTA , but I pity the sister, your parents made you a caregiver forced you into it and now you hate and resent your sister. She loves you. That poor kid.", "NTA, \n\nYour parents suck. Forced friendships never work and the way they treated you, your sister was a chore, not a friend. \n\nBut please acknowledge: technically your sister did nothing wrong. She was raised to expect so many things from you. Your parents taught her, that it\u2019s ok to overstep every boundary. \n\nI get, that you will never move back. And I even get to go BC/LC with your parents. But maybe you can establish now a relationship with your sister based on both your needs and boundary\u2019s. Maybe once a week /month get a cup of coffee and talk about your week or go to the movies. If you need a little time for yourself, then tell her that. Try to get to see, what your parents did wrong (without blaming her) and tell her gently, that you need some time to find your self and set a date in maybe 3 months. \n\nI am just saying that, because it is hard for your sister as well. And you seem like such a strong person, that maybe you can pull it off from being a third parent to become a friend or an actual big sister.", "and this ism also saying that they can be good friends in the future, the sister just has to learn to adjust to the new boundaries", "Conditioning you to take care of your sister includes her moving in with you asap. If you fold , she becomes your problem.", "She's old enough but she's not going to hear it. Because it's not what she wants to hear and she's been raised that only what she wants to hear is worth listening to. OP is burnt out and needs a break from all of it and shouldn't be forced to have that confrontation when she's just figuring out how to be herself with her thoughts and feelings mattering.", "Exactly this. She perhaps isn't being malicious but your parents ingrained this in her head. This is why OP probably resents her. Sister may be confused for a bit and may think you hate her but I think as LandaHolla said that you can set boundaries with her without cutting her completely out (in the beginning). Try to build a sisterhood that works for both of you outside of your parent's demands. If it works out, great. if she can't respect your boundaries, then you may have to go LC", "I didn't go into detail with her about why. I just set down the boundary that it was not happening. At that point I was a little too frustrated to say much else without potentially snapping. And since she's not the one who decided these rules our parents had, I didn't think it would be fair to her.", "Happy cake day!", "She wants to spend time with me but she also wants me to take her places, to cheer her up when she has a bad day, to bring her to stuff I am doing with my friends (not all the time but more than any of my friends had to bring their siblings to stuff). She'd also go to our parents when I said no. So I think she does genuinely admire me but is selfish in her relationships.", "Her sister \u201cadores\u201d her because mom and dad have forced everyone in the family to have their lives revolve around sister. Who knows how sister would feel if OP was actually allowed to live her own life.\n\nBeing self-centered is a completely different thing than standing up for yourself and being your own person.", "I haven't really, no. The truth is I don't like her as a person. I feel like I've always had to give so much to get nothing in return and yeah, she's 16 but it'd not like our age gap is huge. I feel like at the very least I need space because I am tired of it.", "It's about time OP focused on themselves.

I can't say I like her all that much to try and work on things, especially when I already had to give so much.", "Her sister was already ignoring her when she said no visits and was expecting to have a room made up for her. I think she needs a nice long break at least before attempting anything.", "fair enough. Consider which is more hurtful- her not knowing or her learning that your parents used her against you in the way that they did. \n\nIf she is not the actual source of your issue, then maybe you do find a way to tell her that your parents used her to prevent you from having your own friends and relationships. Remind her when she forced her way to your prom as an example. Surely she can see how cringey that was. Dude- I wasn't even allowed to go to my prom without taking you. That you need to establish healthy boundaries from all of that and her trying to make and decorate a space in your home isn't the way.", "Once you stop helping her she will likely learn.", "Just try to realize she was raised in the reverse to you, it's what she expected and was made to expect. It doesn't sound to me like she's a bad person, just... raised to be reliant on you.   \n\n\nI just think it'd be best to have a proper conversation with her at some point, even if you don't open up immediately. Maybe even see a therapist on your own terms to work through it. Even if you're not depressed or having major issues, a therapist can be extremely helpful.", "Right!? Who doesn't adore a person forced to cater to their every whim, who's only allowed to love and dote on them?", "Younger sibling adore older siblings often. The oldest child is always the coolest one because they get to experience everything first, and their lives are so much more exciting to the youngest child. \n\nIt's common for a younger siblings to idolise their older ones, they also crave acceptance by their older sibling and want to spend all their time with them because they genuinely love them.
