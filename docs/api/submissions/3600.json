Keep reinforcing those boundaries. Your sister could've maybe been your friend had your parents not so clearly coddled and spoiled her at your expense, but that ship has sailed. \n\nI'm proud of you for seeing things as they are and doing what you needed to do to get out on your own.

It\u2019s not your fault that your parents created your sister and her apparent inability to live in the real world and it\u2019s not your responsibility to coddle her at the cost of your boundaries and mental health.", "NTA but I would seriously consider sitting your sister down and explaining to her, in detail, why you feel the way you do. Your parents raised her to be reliant on you, it's what she expects because it's all she's ever known. She's old enough to understand your reasons, whether she's happy with them or not.", "NTA.

You can end a conversation. You set the rules of your home. \n\nYou can train them all on how to deal with you.", "NTA.

Siblings are part of a biological lottery and you do not automatically have to \"love\" them and make them an appendange of yourself as your parents insisted on doing.  And look how that worked out--as soon as you were able to, you fled the scene and now what have they got? One kid won't talk with them and the other doesn't know how to function in the world on her own.  Stand your ground, this is a hill to die on.  You and your sister might be able to wor out some sort of an adult relationship later on, but that's not going to happen until she becomes her own person and quits hanging on you like some remora.  Your folks made this mess, now they need to clean it up.  I'm not quite sure I'd call it parentification, but it sure the hell wasn't healthy for either of you.", "NTA. But this isn\u2019t over.

Good on you. \n\ninfo: did you give her an explanation about how her and your parent's conduct toward you made you feel when she asked why? Because I would say- if by \"mean\" you mean that I am no longer going to be a doormat for your inconsiderate treatment of me or for our parents to ignore my needs in favor of your wants- then hell yes, I'm a mean-ass mofo and you better get used to it- or don't- but you are never going to force anything on me ever again. I ran away from YOU. That is why I left. So, no, you will not be coming here.\n\nTo your parents, if they ever get around the block- You keep insisting that I am her friend, but what you mean is doormat.  She is not my friend and never has been. She uses me and treats me like garbage and you have done nothing but enable her which has created a mountain of resentment that even if she were to stop tomorrow and become an actual decent person- is unlikely to resolve anytime soon, so y'all better figure out your plan b for her.", "NTA.   So far from it.  You did what you had to do you can create a life of your own, not live one as your sisters care giver.

It will be great getting my turn! Aren't you excited?!?!?\"", "NTA. I'm sorry your parents did this to you both. Unfortunately, she's just as much a victim of this BS as you are. You are not obligated to be your sister's friend. You aren't obligated to spend time with her ever.  She isn't owed anything from you. \n\nYour parents have set her up for some painful experiences coming up very soon in life. There comes a point when people are a lot less likely to put up with the kinds of manipulative behaviors your sister learned by having her very own a familial servant- sister. It's good for her to learn as many of those lessons as possible now, instead of when she was an adult. \n\nIf you are planning to continue a relationship with her, please continue to unvarnished honesty. Tell her: my relationship with our parents is very different than yours because of..., I have to set boundaries with you now because our parents didn't, I left because our parents treated you as a golden child and me as their SG/ babysitter, they manipulated and gaslit me into making me do everything you wanted, etc. Obviously, wait for the right topic of conversation to come up with each instance. \n\nThese won't always be comfortable conversations for her, but if she starts to displace blame, defend, etc, just remind her that the price of having a relationship is having these kinds of talks. \n\nMaybe by the time she moves out she'll be a better sister to you.", "Eh.... NTA but I have to be concerned about your sister. I'm really unable to gauge if your sister is selfish and entitled or legitimately adores and likes you. It seems like they treat you rather amiable, not just stealing from you or something but actually wanting to spend time with you or looking up to you?   \n\n\nI wouldn't punish your sister purely for what your parents did. You could still have a relationship with them, but one in which you set the boundaries and have your own terms. Or don't , you're an adult living your own life.

Your sister adores you, she's only 16. Have you had a NICE grown up conversation with her, where you put up some boundaries and mention how you get hurt by her cos she doesn't want to do things you like, only what she likes that you don't like? \n\nI have two younger sisters, and yes they could be annoying at different stages of life but they grew into my best friends. You seem remarkably self centred.", "NTA for holding your ground, you\u2019re allowed to have your own space. Hopefully when she grows up more, if you continue on this path, you can have a normal balanced relationship. \n\nBut are you sure you want to block your parents and sister entirely? What you described is obviously negative and worth instating boundaries for sure. I don\u2019t know how toxic your home life was, but perhaps there\u2019s something salvageable in there?", "NTA. But I don't think they are truly AHs, either. Your parents tried to force a close relationship, & that was a mistake. Hopefully, after you've had some much-needed alone time & your sister matures, you'll get along better & not resent her so much. She considers you her best friend, from the sound of it, & she probably doesn't realize how much you didn't like not having a choice about bringing her along everywhere. She's spoiled, but a little time & maturity will help that. She lives you - don't forget that. \n\nAll these people commenting hateful things about your parents probably haven't been parents. This is a cruel world, & having a family who has your back is a good thing. Your parents tried hard to build that loyal bond between you, but they took it too far. That doesn't mean they were bad or using you, but they should have let you fight & do separate things. \n\nI hope you can find a healthy, unoppressive level of involvement with your family.", "NTA.

Forced friendships never work and the way they treated you, your sister was a chore, not a friend. \n\nBut please acknowledge: technically your sister did nothing wrong. She was raised to expect so many things from you. Your parents taught her, that it\u2019s ok to overstep every boundary. \n\nI get, that you will never move back. And I even get to go BC/LC with your parents. But maybe you can establish now a relationship with your sister based on both your needs and boundary\u2019s. Maybe once a week /month get a cup of coffee and talk about your week or go to the movies. If you need a little time for yourself, then tell her that. Try to get to see, what your parents did wrong (without blaming her) and tell her gently, that you need some time to find your self and set a date in maybe 3 months. \n\nI am just saying that, because it is hard for your sister as well.

Consider which is more hurtful- her not knowing or her learning that your parents used her against you in the way that they did. \n\nIf she is not the actual source of your issue, then maybe you do find a way to tell her that your parents used her to prevent you from having your own friends and relationships. Remind her when she forced her way to your prom as an example. Surely she can see how cringey that was. Dude- I wasn't even allowed to go to my prom without taking you.

Moving out and getting space from one another definitely helped grow our appreciation for each other.  \n\nI'm so sorry your parents forced your relationship with your sister, effectively ruining it!

Between 18-21 my sister and I grew apart a lot. We were both no longer living at home and I found that she would only reach out if she wanted to talk about herself or needed something. She never asked about me, about my life, and when I talked about myself I felt like she wasn\u2019t listening. She often judged me very harshly over stuff and it made me not want to spend time with her.

Op should consider putting some distance between herself and her \u201cfamily.\u201d", "NTA. And I definitely see why you moved out!! Boundaries are a great thing to have. You\u2019re parents created that monster and now they get to fully deal with her!", "NTA", "NTA Good job baby girl for setting boundaries.", "I kinda feel sorry for your sister because she grew up with your parents ideals. You\u2019re NTA, but she isn\u2019t either. Your parents set a standard for you that you weren\u2019t going to accept but forgot to include you in on their decision.", "NTA, but after a little while, consider unblocking your sister. Just to send her a message explaining how your parents have made you put her above everything/one else. That you don't hate her (in assuming you don't) but resent the dynamics. Maybe even ask her to come out for a coffee/cocoa/smoothie/tea/burger and a chat about how things used to be, how your parents treated you and how you'd like things to be going fwd. I think she deserves to know it's not her fault, but with some changes, you guys can start to become friends. \n\nMy mom did force my little sister (3 years my iunior) on me but nowhere near the extent you're describing. We get along really well now, but we hated each other for basically all of my teenage years. She became a bossy brat way before she hit her teens, lol.  But we talked it out as adults and were good now.", "NAH You have a right to set boundaries and not have a relationship with your sister.  She (due to your parents) has an unrealistic view of how close you are and what your relationship is, as you said she adores you, so of course she will be upset and confused by the change.  Again not your fault, but not really her either, the real AH are your parents.", "Thinking that your sister wanting overnights and to move in two years from now is because your parents have not paid much attention to her after you left.", "NTA. But I think you need to be more honest with your sister about your perspective and experiences growing up and why her experience was different then yours. Maybe she will validate, learn and be a better person. If not, then keep doing why you are doing.", "NTA, just don't hate her. Sadly she was educated to use you. With some luck some time in the future the relationship can be fixed. But for now take care of yourself.", "Exactly what I came to say. I also can't stand my sister and have to set boundaries.", "Did you not read the post. If she had a nightmare she was told to go to her sisters room. Home sick big sis had to stay home. Her senior prom had to take little sister. Taking her places big sis should drive you. OP's parents are the asshole  of the story. Little sis unfortunately is a product of their actions and doubtfully will not learn. OP is nta.", "You handled that well, imho. Give yourself some time then consider telling her your side- either by email or phone. I do think you need months-a year of space from your parents. If they\u2019re a packaged deal, you can try to reconnect with your sister once you\u2019re both older and have a better sense of self. \nImho, you were clearly mistreated, but she\u2019ll suffer more through life due to their negligent parenting. Absolutely not your problem to fix, but try to keep an open mind once you\u2019re ready.", "Nothing ventured, nothing gained. OP might as well give it a shot.", "I actually do like the idea of trying to talk to her like an adult and share your side of the story of how you felt in your home growing up and why you decided to move out, etc\u2026 it sounds like the sister might not have bad intentions, rather she was just raised to be spoiled and is unaware of her attitude. OP is totally NTA for setting boundaries and wanting space, but one can only hope that one day they\u2019ll have a good relationship and the only way for that to happen is to be up front with her about your feelings.", "I did read the post, I meant in regards to the \"free childcare\" comment. My younger brother is two years younger than me and while my mom often wanted me to look after him, there was not real babysitting. OP is well within her rights to not want her sister to come to her apartment.", "NTA.\nA bond like that can't be forced, and forcing it only increases resentment, as you're fully aware. It's not entirely your sister's fault that she drank the koolaid that your parents gave her, but how you feel is fully justified.", "NTA. My sister and I had a 2 year difference, her older than me. We did not get along during our teen years, but as we became adults we became friends. If our parents pushed us to be friends it would not have happened. Maybe down the road as she gets more mature, but you need to take care of yourself", "NTA \n\nA good sibling relationship is both do things for each other. \n\nI have a brilliant relationship with my brother, but I was never responsible for his happiness and he isn\u2019t responsible for mine!  Sheesh!\n\nGood on you for setting those boundaries. \n\nYour sister has some growing up to do and maybe you can be close later on when she realizes who she is in life", "NTA it sucks that it has to be like this but if your sister won\u2019t respect boundaries you\u2019ll probably have to block her too.", "I\u2019m thankful for my older sister. My mom made her take me with her when she went to spend the night at friends houses. As an adult I can see that it should have been embarrassing. As a child I didn\u2019t see it. My sister and I were and still are besties.", "Nta- sorry ur family sux! Congrats on new place", "NTA\n\nThis is called establishing and maintaining a boundary, which you were never allowed when you were growing up. Now you've the power to be your own person, live your own life, and have your own things without needing to check your sisters approval. Meanwhile, your sisters going to have to learn how to make and keep friends or be alone as an adult.", "NTA. But now could be a chance to create a healthy sibling relationship.  Neither of you are malicious or hostile, she doesn\u2019t know any better and is just a kid who\u2019s parents have done her, you and your sibling relationship a great disservice. It doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing to have a sister.", "NTA. Your parents created this.", "You\u2019re NTA and it sounds like you need distance from your family.\n\nGive your sister grace, because she is young and she\u2019s been raised to rely on you in this way.  This isn\u2019t really her fault - but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to sacrifice your peace for her. \n\nThe saddest part is, there\u2019s every chance you would have had a good relationship if your parents had just backed off.\n\nHopefully some distance will let her make her own friends and learn how to keep them.\n\nVery much NTA.", "NTA at all! There is a saying that people choose the version of you they held the most power over\u2026\n\n\nMaybe write your sister a letter to explain how you feel. It seems this behaviour is so normalised she has never considered the toll on you.", "NTA.", "I agree somewhat. But not that the \u201cship has sailed\u201d. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late to establish a good sisterly relationship", "It also sounds like they\u2019ve seriously screwed up OPs little sister.", "This is mature of you and I hope that by setting and keeping these boundaries that you are able to build a loving, sisterly relationship with her in the future. Good luck and definitely NTA my lovely xxx"]}
