Keep reinforcing those boundaries. Your sister could've maybe been your friend had your parents not so clearly coddled and spoiled her at your expense, but that ship has sailed. \n\nI'm proud of you for seeing things as they are and doing what you needed to do to get out on your own.

It\u2019s not your fault that your parents created your sister and her apparent inability to live in the real world and it\u2019s not your responsibility to coddle her at the cost of your boundaries and mental health.", "NTA but I would seriously consider sitting your sister down and explaining to her, in detail, why you feel the way you do. Your parents raised her to be reliant on you, it's what she expects because it's all she's ever known. She's old enough to understand your reasons, whether she's happy with them or not.", "NTA.

You can end a conversation. You set the rules of your home. \n\nYou can train them all on how to deal with you.", "NTA.

Siblings are part of a biological lottery and you do not automatically have to \"love\" them and make them an appendange of yourself as your parents insisted on doing.  And look how that worked out--as soon as you were able to, you fled the scene and now what have they got? One kid won't talk with them and the other doesn't know how to function in the world on her own.  Stand your ground, this is a hill to die on.  You and your sister might be able to wor out some sort of an adult relationship later on, but that's not going to happen until she becomes her own person and quits hanging on you like some remora.  Your folks made this mess, now they need to clean it up.  I'm not quite sure I'd call it parentification, but it sure the hell wasn't healthy for either of you.", "NTA. But this isn\u2019t over.

Good on you. \n\ninfo: did you give her an explanation about how her and your parent's conduct toward you made you feel when she asked why? Because I would say- if by \"mean\" you mean that I am no longer going to be a doormat for your inconsiderate treatment of me or for our parents to ignore my needs in favor of your wants- then hell yes, I'm a mean-ass mofo and you better get used to it- or don't- but you are never going to force anything on me ever again. I ran away from YOU. That is why I left. So, no, you will not be coming here.\n\nTo your parents, if they ever get around the block- You keep insisting that I am her friend, but what you mean is doormat.  She is not my friend and never has been. She uses me and treats me like garbage and you have done nothing but enable her which has created a mountain of resentment that even if she were to stop tomorrow and become an actual decent person- is unlikely to resolve anytime soon, so y'all better figure out your plan b for her.", "NTA.   So far from it.  You did what you had to do you can create a life of your own, not live one as your sisters care giver.

It will be great getting my turn! Aren't you excited?!?!?\"", "NTA. I'm sorry your parents did this to you both. Unfortunately, she's just as much a victim of this BS as you are. You are not obligated to be your sister's friend. You aren't obligated to spend time with her ever.  She isn't owed anything from you. \n\nYour parents have set her up for some painful experiences coming up very soon in life. There comes a point when people are a lot less likely to put up with the kinds of manipulative behaviors your sister learned by having her very own a familial servant- sister. It's good for her to learn as many of those lessons as possible now, instead of when she was an adult. \n\nIf you are planning to continue a relationship with her, please continue to unvarnished honesty. Tell her: my relationship with our parents is very different than yours because of..., I have to set boundaries with you now because our parents didn't, I left because our parents treated you as a golden child and me as their SG/ babysitter, they manipulated and gaslit me into making me do everything you wanted, etc. Obviously, wait for the right topic of conversation to come up with each instance. \n\nThese won't always be comfortable conversations for her, but if she starts to displace blame, defend, etc, just remind her that the price of having a relationship is having these kinds of talks. \n\nMaybe by the time she moves out she'll be a better sister to you.", "Eh.... NTA but I have to be concerned about your sister. I'm really unable to gauge if your sister is selfish and entitled or legitimately adores and likes you. It seems like they treat you rather amiable, not just stealing from you or something but actually wanting to spend time with you or looking up to you?   \n\n\nI wouldn't punish your sister purely for what your parents did. You could still have a relationship with them, but one in which you set the boundaries and have your own terms. Or don't , you're an adult living your own life.

Your sister adores you, she's only 16. Have you had a NICE grown up conversation with her, where you put up some boundaries and mention how you get hurt by her cos she doesn't want to do things you like, only what she likes that you don't like? \n\nI have two younger sisters, and yes they could be annoying at different stages of life but they grew into my best friends. You seem remarkably self centred.", "NTA for holding your ground, you\u2019re allowed to have your own space. Hopefully when she grows up more, if you continue on this path, you can have a normal balanced relationship. \n\nBut are you sure you want to block your parents and sister entirely? What you described is obviously negative and worth instating boundaries for sure. I don\u2019t know how toxic your home life was, but perhaps there\u2019s something salvageable in there?", "NTA. But I don't think they are truly AHs, either. Your parents tried to force a close relationship, & that was a mistake. Hopefully, after you've had some much-needed alone time & your sister matures, you'll get along better & not resent her so much. She considers you her best friend, from the sound of it, & she probably doesn't realize how much you didn't like not having a choice about bringing her along everywhere. She's spoiled, but a little time & maturity will help that. She lives you - don't forget that. \n\nAll these people commenting hateful things about your parents probably haven't been parents. This is a cruel world, & having a family who has your back is a good thing. Your parents tried hard to build that loyal bond between you, but they took it too far. That doesn't mean they were bad or using you, but they should have let you fight & do separate things. \n\nI hope you can find a healthy, unoppressive level of involvement with your family.", "NTA.

Forced friendships never work and the way they treated you, your sister was a chore, not a friend. \n\nBut please acknowledge: technically your sister did nothing wrong. She was raised to expect so many things from you. Your parents taught her, that it\u2019s ok to overstep every boundary. \n\nI get, that you will never move back. And I even get to go BC/LC with your parents. But maybe you can establish now a relationship with your sister based on both your needs and boundary\u2019s. Maybe once a week /month get a cup of coffee and talk about your week or go to the movies. If you need a little time for yourself, then tell her that. Try to get to see, what your parents did wrong (without blaming her) and tell her gently, that you need some time to find your self and set a date in maybe 3 months. \n\nI am just saying that, because it is hard for your sister as well.

Consider which is more hurtful- her not knowing or her learning that your parents used her against you in the way that they did. \n\nIf she is not the actual source of your issue, then maybe you do find a way to tell her that your parents used her to prevent you from having your own friends and relationships. Remind her when she forced her way to your prom as an example. Surely she can see how cringey that was. Dude- I wasn't even allowed to go to my prom without taking you.

Moving out and getting space from one another definitely helped grow our appreciation for each other.  \n\nI'm so sorry your parents forced your relationship with your sister, effectively ruining it!  Maybe later in life you can get to know each other's true selves and become friends naturally.  For now, enjoy your boundaries and independence!", "NTA And remember, you don\u2019t even have to let your sister in your home.

I like the one not to answer your door if anyone of them comes. If they don\u2019t know where you live don\u2019t give it to them. Change your number and if possible move away when your lease is up. You deserve to be appreciated for you. Your own life and happiness. Maybe at some time you can reconnect. But you are your first priority", "NTA. Well done.", "NTA. I have a lot of advice. My family dynamic is very different but my sister and I are also two years apart. My parents have always walked on eggshells around her and growing up, I felt as though they relied on me to cater to her. \n\nI\u2019m in my twenties now and I can actually kind of understand where they were coming from. My sister struggled a lot with making friends and feeling included and I think parents just want their siblings to be close.\n\nRegardless, you are NTA because you\u2019re right, you don\u2019t have to be friends with your siblings. Between 18-21 my sister and I grew apart a lot. We were both no longer living at home and I found that she would only reach out if she wanted to talk about herself or needed something. She never asked about me, about my life, and when I talked about myself I felt like she wasn\u2019t listening. She often judged me very harshly over stuff and it made me not want to spend time with her. My parents were upset about us growing apart but I had to tell them straight up that if a friend treated me the way she did, I wouldn\u2019t be friends with them anymore. Just because she is your sister doesn\u2019t mean you owe her anything. \n\nHowever, she is young (in my eyes). If your parents have been and still do cater to her, she may not realize she is wrong or why she is pushing you away. I would talk to her. My sister and I ended up having a huge conversation this year where we just let it all out and addressed the root causes. We are now closer than ever and she\u2019s been a lot more considerate since I told her how I felt.\n\nFamily shit is hard. You are NTA. But I would try to keep your sister close even if you don\u2019t wanna be close with your parents.", "I feel like there's much more to this story. I can't give an honest opinion.", "I'm not sure I would close the door on any future relationship with her. Your parents have created an untenable relationship between you two and as time goes on your sister may mature and see things for what they truly are. In the meantime, I think you are taking the right course of action in maintaining your autonomy and independence. It might help to tell your sister in a kind way that you are trying to make a life for yourself and give yourself time to heal from the bad blood your parents visited upon you.

Instead of having to deal with their terrible parenting decisions that led her to being unable to make friends because of her selfishness they instead forced you to become a punching bag for her emotional needs. It\u2019s time for her to realize that her and your parents behavior is not normal and maybe now that she doesn\u2019t have you as a fallback she\u2019ll be forced to evaluate her behavior and why she can\u2019t make/ keep friends and hopefully your parents will learn their lesson when they don\u2019t have you around to divert your sisters attention to and have to deal with the consequences of their actions head on.", "Nta", "NTA. You can and absolutely *should* set these boundaries now. It sounds like you were parentified because your parents didn't want to give either of you the support you deserved, do they hoped you would get it from each other. It's not fair to you, but it's also not fair to her. My only advice is to not totally discount the possibility of a real relationship with your sister (*much* further down the line, of course) once she's an adult and able to see the manipulation you both suffered with the benefit of hindsight. I have a much stronger relationship with both of my siblings as adults and without the involvement of our parents, and I'm so grateful we were able to find that.", "NTA - maintain those boundary lines, No is No and you don't need to apologize, explain or defend that.

She has been told she doesn't have a room and will not be staying over. She can't demand that you let her do these things, when you do not want them and never has.
