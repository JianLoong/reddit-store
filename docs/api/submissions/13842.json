{"id": 13842, "submission_id": "129vgvn", "title": "AITA for refusing to give my school the money I made from selling cookies around the neighborhood?", "selftext": "My (16F) school recently held a bake sale for our school's sports teams, expecting we wouldn't actually make any money. The day before the bake sale, our vice principal decided that we would be assigned a dessert and, of course, we got the short end of the stick. The football team were chosen to make chocolate chip cookies while we were told to make raisin cookies. My friend Miranda (17F) and her mom spent hours that night making the cookies from scratch. They ended up making 52 cookies in total. Being that we were chosen to make raisin cookies, nobody bought anything we made and so we made no money. Our schools sports funding is to be spilt equally among all the teams, but 90% of it goes towards the football team. The vice principal and all the teams agreed we would get 50% of the profit we made from the bake sale and the rest would go towards a local charity. This bake sale was a way for us to pay for our next going away game. Initially we were all going to make different things, but, of course, our vice principal did what she did and we made no money. I knew this was going to happen, so at the end of the school day. I took all the cookies Miranda made and started selling them around my neighborhood priced 1 dollar each. 30 people bought cookies and my dad gave me 12 dollars just for the rest of the cookies. They took me 4 hours to sell. The next day at practice, I gave Miranda 15 dollars and put the rest towards our trip. At lunch we were all talking about how Miranda can make other desserts and how we can go around selling them in our neighborhoods, which can probably pay for our whole trip, and how we don\u2019t need to pay the school at all. Of course, one of the football guys overheard us and reported us to the vice principal. She later called us into her office and told us if we didn\u2019t hand over 50% of the money to charity, our team wouldn\u2019t be allowed to play in our next game. I told her no and that she was the reason we didn\u2019t make any money in the first place and if she let us keep our original plans, we would have made more money. She told me how dare I speak to her that way and if I didn\u2019t hand over the money she would call the police and our parents for theft but I still insisted no. We had to stay at our school till our parents came and she had the school officer stand behind us the whole time we ended up handing all the money over and not 50% and we were told our team was suspended from playing until further notice and that I was to attend Friday detention for a week. That night, my mom screamed at me about how I was entitled, disrespectful and needed to grow the fuck up I just ignored her as usual. I texted Miranda that night apologizing and told me what I did was kind of rude, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1680463943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129vgvn/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_school_the_money_i/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The way to donate to the team is to give it to the school to distribute not try to have side money that you contribute to your team directly.

If you escalate this you will lose and you might get kicked off of the team. Take the L. A better way to handle this would have been to come up with a fundraising idea that you present to this terrible VP and there you bring up any issues you feel have affected your team.

Even if everyone makes chocolate chip cookies they are the most popular. Using your words might have worked here but you just acted like a spoiled teen.

The VP is almost certainly doing something illegal. Unequal funding of extracurricular activities based on sex was so common a law had to be passed against it, and it remains extremely common to this day.

But the truth is football costs more and brings in more revenue. Football probably pays for some of the girls sports. So it\u2019s in the OP\u2019s best interest to share that money. It\u2019s also the rule. So she can complain but she won\u2019t win and the real lesson here is to not try to circumvent the rules bc you don\u2019t like them or think they are fair. You need to grow up. But you don\u2019t have to stfu. It\u2019s a free country. I hope you have a wonderful day. No shade.", "Ha! I get why y\u2019all are upset with me but you\u2019re not taking into account that the OP is a teenager and upset.
