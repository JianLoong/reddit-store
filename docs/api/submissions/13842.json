{"id": 13842, "submission_id": "129vgvn", "title": "AITA for refusing to give my school the money I made from selling cookies around the neighborhood?", "selftext": "My (16F) school recently held a bake sale for our school's sports teams, expecting we wouldn't actually make any money. The day before the bake sale, our vice principal decided that we would be assigned a dessert and, of course, we got the short end of the stick. The football team were chosen to make chocolate chip cookies while we were told to make raisin cookies. My friend Miranda (17F) and her mom spent hours that night making the cookies from scratch. They ended up making 52 cookies in total. Being that we were chosen to make raisin cookies, nobody bought anything we made and so we made no money. Our schools sports funding is to be spilt equally among all the teams, but 90% of it goes towards the football team. The vice principal and all the teams agreed we would get 50% of the profit we made from the bake sale and the rest would go towards a local charity. This bake sale was a way for us to pay for our next going away game. Initially we were all going to make different things, but, of course, our vice principal did what she did and we made no money. I knew this was going to happen, so at the end of the school day. I took all the cookies Miranda made and started selling them around my neighborhood priced 1 dollar each. 30 people bought cookies and my dad gave me 12 dollars just for the rest of the cookies. They took me 4 hours to sell. The next day at practice, I gave Miranda 15 dollars and put the rest towards our trip. At lunch we were all talking about how Miranda can make other desserts and how we can go around selling them in our neighborhoods, which can probably pay for our whole trip, and how we don\u2019t need to pay the school at all. Of course, one of the football guys overheard us and reported us to the vice principal. She later called us into her office and told us if we didn\u2019t hand over 50% of the money to charity, our team wouldn\u2019t be allowed to play in our next game. I told her no and that she was the reason we didn\u2019t make any money in the first place and if she let us keep our original plans, we would have made more money. She told me how dare I speak to her that way and if I didn\u2019t hand over the money she would call the police and our parents for theft but I still insisted no. We had to stay at our school till our parents came and she had the school officer stand behind us the whole time we ended up handing all the money over and not 50% and we were told our team was suspended from playing until further notice and that I was to attend Friday detention for a week. That night, my mom screamed at me about how I was entitled, disrespectful and needed to grow the fuck up I just ignored her as usual. I texted Miranda that night apologizing and told me what I did was kind of rude, so AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the advice, everyone. After talking with my dad and Miranda, I came to the realization that me yelling at the vice principal wasn\u2019t going to solve any issues and I was only making things worse. I should have handled this better, so that\u2019s my fault. On Monday I\u2019m going to apologize and let this go. Everyone is saying go to the local news station and things like that, but this is quite a small issue, so I\u2019m only encouraging Miranda to go to the school board about the vice principal taking her money away, other than that I\u2019m staying out of this.\n\nP.S: said in a comment earlier that said she didn\u2019t pay the lunch ladies but that\u2019s all speculation and probably just kids exaggerating things", "created_utc": 1680463943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129vgvn/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_school_the_money_i/", "score": 488, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
