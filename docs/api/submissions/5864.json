I would have done the same thing. After multiple \"shhs\" and attempts at quieting the kid, the parents should have handled the situation or removed themselves. The fact that they allowed their kid to disrupt the movie even when people were clearly upset, is a problem.

The kid was disrupting the movie and ruining the experience for everyone. The parents didn't do a good job of keeping him quiet. You did what you had to do. As far as using the word 'fuck', the kid was 11-12 years old as per one of OP's comments so it's okay to use that word - it's not like he was a toddler who heard it for the first time. Maybe it would have been more tactful to not use that word but I don't think it's that big of a deal and from the looks of it the kid learnt a lesson. I don't get all the Y-T-A comments.", "NTA.
