We held an engagement party at the beginning of September. \n\nWe had a nice time until the end of the night when my FMIL started to guilt trip my partner saying she\u2019s not his no1 anymore and I\u2019m taking him away from her. The next day I then found out from my family she was saying things behind our backs to them about how we\u2019re too young to be getting married. My family. I was horrified. My partner spoke with her and she said my family took it the wrong way she was joking. \n\nWe left it at that and wanted to move on. We went to view a venue that we fell in love with and we booked it. The minimum amount of guests was 50. When my partner told my mil this she flipped the lid saying she couldn\u2019t enjoy her day with her family because she thought only 50 were being invited. \n\nWe both went for a chat with her and tried to explain this to her but she couldn\u2019t understand. She then began to get involved in my family business as my mother isn\u2019t being invited to the wedding as she abused me for years. I told her to stay out of my family business it has nothing to do with her. She started cursing at me shouting calling my partner names. Saying we\u2019re too young and idiots for picking the venue we did. \n\nShe called all her family members making up stories about us. We cancelled the venue and I can\u2019t even stomach thinking about planning another wedding. I cry every time I think about it. I don\u2019t want to be involved with my partners mom as I don\u2019t trust her. I won\u2019t be shouted and cursed at by anyone. I told my partner this and he fully supports my decision. \n\nI fear in years to come he\u2019s going to resent me for not wanting to be involved with his family. Especially when we have kids and I don\u2019t trust her around them. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nShould I get over her ruining what was meant to be the happiest day of our lives? \n\nAITA for not wanting to forgive her?", "created_utc": 1695993752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vbjrv/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_mil/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your partner agrees with you, so why are you trying to second guess yourself? \nYour MIL seems absolutelly horrible and she is the same way towards her son. Be clear with him about how you feel about contact with her. If he feels conflicted, it may be useful for the both of you to see a therapist and discuss your fears and some strategies to navigate the relationship with MIL in the future.", "Your partner needs to take the lead in dealing with his mom. Don't marry him until he does, or you'll be stuck in this situation for life. NTA.", "NTA\n\nMIL got exactly what she wanted and intended - you're not even able to think about or plan the wedding. She effectively canceled your wedding. \n\nWhat your fiance does now will be highly instructive to your future. Please proceed with extreme caution. MIL is an abuser, and he may not see it.", "NTA.....I would elope with some of our closest friends if I were the two of you. This isn't the way planning should go. And if your MIL is being this ridiculous now, I can't imagine how she would be the day of.  \nDo something for the two of you.", "NTA. The best part of this is that your fiance supports you and is on the same page. Do NOT let this witch rob you of your special day. Having said that, your concerns about the future are valid - Mommie Dearest will be in your lives and doing her best to poison others, for better or worse until you go nc. You and your fiance really do need to talk about how to manage this, perhaps with the help of a couples therapist. Again, don't give her the power of ruining your wedding or marriage. Do get help, and get creative with how to manage her. Best of luck!", "Spend your money and elope in a beautiful location without telling anyone! Go to Greece and do whatever you do there bc my mind just went blank lol. Come back with amazing pictures and even more amazing stories. If your fianc\u00e9e supports the lack of contact with his family I have a feeling this isn\u2019t his first rodeo with his mom and he\u2019s probably tired of her crap. As long as he always puts you first and her last\u2026you can get through her crap until you guys go full no contact.", "NTA for being hurt and upset.  Plan the wedding you and your partner want and ignore everyone else.  This is your day and your life.  You don't have to trust her or really even get along with her.  All you have to do is be civil with her.  When you have kids, re-evaluate the whole situation and take it from there.  As long as your partner supports you, you will be fine.  Keep communication open with him and just do what you have to do to be happy.", "NTA. But I understand your concerns. It is one thing for him to say he supports you and is willing to cut her off in the heat of the moment. Over time as she and other family members wear him down with guilt trips and manipulation that may change. I would recommend a long engagement and counseling to help him understand this has likely been a pattern with her and how to manage her and the rest of the family. Make sure he still feels this way in another year or so. Also, the JustNoMIL reddit may be of interest to both of you.", "NTA.  The most important thing here is that your partner totally and completely support you in this matter.  \n\nThere are many options for getting married.  If you can't plan a traditional wedding in a reasonably peaceful manner, then time to consider some of those options.  Frankly, I've never been a fan of big weddings so perhaps I am biased.  To me, it's never about the party but rather the marriage and many weddings don't feel this way to me.  Maybe you would be happier eloping with some good friends present.  Only you know what will suit you best.  Does sound like there will be some serious stress around planning a typical wedding.  \n\nYour FMIL's cursing and shouting at you doesn't bode well for your future relationship, for sure, and her trying to contact your family to complain about you is over the top.  I typically go for working things out, but sounds like this may be one of those situations where that won't be possible.  So sorry.  Like I said at the beginning, it's so very important that your partner and you see this situation the same way as his support of you in this matter will make or break your relationship going forward.", "NTA- if this isn't the first time that she has disrespected you, then I don't blame you for not wanting to forgive her. Has she apologized, even?   \n\n\nPersonally, I think that a lot of family members (even in laws) have disagreements and obviously, it would be easiest to forgive and move on. BUT, if this is going to be a frequent occurrence, that would be hard. Maybe forgiving, but establishing strong boundaries would be best in order to allow your husband to still maintain whatever relationship he sees fit with his mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Make sure your fiance is the one who does the communicating with her as she will use anything you say against you.  He needs to tell her that she has no business communicating with your family or disparaging you to his.  Is he ready to go low or no contact permanently or will be push you to tolerate her abhorrent behavior.  If you two are comfortable moving forward either elope or have a quiet wedding with only those guests who love and support you.  It's not so much about the wedding as it is about how you will live the rest of your lives together.  Congratulations and best of luck!", "NTA\n\nFuture MIL is a nasty piece of work.\n\nConsider eloping and only have a few close friends and family there.", "NTA she sounds absolutely awful. Glad partner sees her toxic behavior for what it is and is on your side.", "**NTA** \n\nYour FMIL has behaved horribly. I\u2019m sorry you felt you had to cancel your venue because of her.  \n\nSince your Fianc\u00e9 has your back, just elope or don\u2019t invite her to the wedding.", "NTA - but you are right. My family is fed up with my wife and I have been excluded from get togethers because of it. Resentment is real in a situation like this.", "Have you talked to... your \\*fiance\\* about this?\n\nBecause as this story goes, it seems like he acknowledges his mother is a whackjob and you're right to want to keep away from her.  Maybe that's not how he actually feels, deep down, but ultimately in a relationship you have to judge people on their actions and statements unless you're a psychic.  \n\nFrom an outside viewpoint you seem a bit histrionic.  But an outside viewpoint is irrelevant here.", "Rebook the venue.  Don\u2019t invite FMIL.  Problem solved.  Your partner is telling you it\u2019s ok he also doesn\u2019t forgive her.  You have nothing to feel bad about.  NTA", "NTA, don't keep in touch with her or be involved if you're not comfortable. She had no reason to bring up your mother when she knew what happened. She had no reason to flip out over the guest list because its not her damn wedding. 50 people or not, that is up to you not her. She is just looking for excuses for you guys not to get married. As for the too young comment, let her know that she is too old to be acting like a baby. \n\nHave your wedding, the way you want to have it, and don't invite her or any toxic people to it.", "She's jealous that you're taking her baby boy away from her. Tell her to throw whatever kind of party she wants but that you won't be there, and go have the wedding you and your fiancee actually want. NTA", "Why did you cancel your venue?", "No he doesn\u2019t he said i shouldn\u2019t do anything that makes me uncomfortable!", "Thank you for your advice!", "Honestly this. If he doesn\u2019t handle his out of line mother while they\u2019re dating he\u2019s definitely not going to do it when they\u2019re married", "No she hasn\u2019t apologized she just said \u201cyou know how I am\u201d", "That's all the answer you need, right there. If your partner doesn't think you're an ah, why would you care what reddit has to say?", "Excellent!", "NTA I think you need to have an honest conversation with you fiance ad tell him what your worried about. Discuss what your life will look if you can't be around her.", "Because I\u2019m trying to see it from my partners point of view If I\u2019m damaging our relationship by not wanting to be involved with his family. That\u2019s why I care what Reddit has to say \ud83d\ude0a I don\u2019t want to be selfish", "But he's already telling you his point of view. Reddit can and will give you 101 different answers.", "Ask him. Communication is the thing here. You need to ask him how he might feel later on down the road when you continue to not be around his family and when you have kids you don't want them around his family. He might not know how he's going to feel, but you might be able to get a little bit of a gauge on it.\n\nOh, and fuck a venue. Elope and spend the money on a fabulous honeymoon or house.", "And i find it helpful to hear it from other people\u2019s perspectives and if people have gone through it as well. If you read my post properly I said I was worried about the future.", "People change, so whatever happens in the future, future you and future partner (husband!) will work it out. Right now, your partner is telling you you're right to feel the way you feel.", "\nI've been married for 35 years.  My husband was the posterboy Mommas boy.  There was 20 years where she and he put me through hell. I finally decided that I deserved respect and I would not tolerate anything less.  We argued, it was bumpy, but it is better now.  I have not spoken to her in 2 years.", "Also, you've already proven you're not selfish by caring not only for what your partner thinks, but also what he doesn't but might think in the future.
