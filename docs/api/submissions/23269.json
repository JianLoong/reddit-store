He acts like he lives here. They've been dating for two years, so he's gotten really comfortable with our family and our house. My little brother (14) is sick right now, and it has been really stressful. When I'm not at school I'm either at the hospital with my 14yo brother or at home watching my 8yo brother. It has been a lot.\n\nThis morning I was in the kitchen making food to bring to my parents at the hospital, when who should walk in? My sister's boyfriend. He asked me if I wanted help cooking, and I said no (he doesn't even know how to cook). He then proceeded to just stand there in the kitchen, getting in my way. I asked what he was doing, and he said he was waiting for me to be done. I asked why, and he said he was going to make something.\n\nI told him that maybe he should go to *his* house and use *his* kitchen then. He said he wasn't trying to bother me. I said that he is bothering me, and I'm sick of him always being here invading our space. I can't even relax in my own home the rare moments I get to myself because he's *always* here. He said I wasn't being fair, and that he's scared for my brother too, and I shouldn't take it out on him.\n\nI told him to shut up, that he has no idea what he's talking about and to go home. Then he said it's important to stick together when there's a tragedy. I said yeah, families stick together, but he isn't a member of our family, so let us have a day or two a week to ourselves and leave us alone once in a while. Then he left.\n\nMy sister was pissed when she came down twenty minutes later. She said I'm a mean bitter douchebag. She said I had no right to say that to her boyfriend, and he's her guest, so he can come over whenever he wants. I didn't want to fight with her, so I just said fine. Was I really being a douchebag though? Why is this guy always here??\n\nUpdate: Thank you for all the advice everyone. I did end up talking to my dad. He came home and spoke to my sister's boyfriend. He told the boyfriend he needs to not come over before eleven in the morning or be here after seven at night. He also told the boyfriend he can't use our kitchen or let himself into the house. He needs to knock and be let in, and when he is hungry he needs to go home to get food. My dad also put my brother's games in his room and told the boyfriend not to go into anyone's bedroom he hasn't been invited into.\n\nMy sister was pretty upset about all of this, especially the rule saying he has to leave by seven PM. My dad asked her if he's been sleeping over, and she swore up and down he wasn't. I don't think that's true, but it doesn't matter. My sister's boyfriend was pretty embarrassed and apologized to my dad, saying he didn't realize he was being a nuisance. My dad said it was fine and gave him a hug. I told him I was sorry I snapped at him, and we hugged it out too. So I think everyone is good, even though my sister is pissed at me and my dad. My dad said she will be better off in the long run, because if she wants to see her boyfriend outside those hours she'll have to leave her room.", "created_utc": 1690475288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15b6dqv/aita_because_i_told_my_sisters_boyfriend_he_isnt/", "score": 1769, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was always bloody over! I just wanted some time without her around so I could decompress.", "NTA - I'm sure the boyfriend is nice, but he's not family so he's a little more outside of this awful situation and needs to respect the immediate family's' needs. \n\nAm I understanding correctly that he came over and planned to cook in the kitchen and your sister wasn't even home? Even without a sick family member I'd be pretty annoyed at someone just showing up like that and the person they are with isn't there to deal with them. I'm sure your parents have a lot going on but maybe you guys can at least set up a boundary of him not coming over if your sister isn't there.", "NTA", "You are stressed and concerned about your younger brother.\n\nThis guy is not your friend, he is sister's BF.  I would be very annoyed that someone came walking into the house without knocking and said he was going cook in your home after you were finished.  He is eating the food that your parents purchased for your family.  It feels like he is taking advantage of your family.\n\nHe defends himself and inserts himself as if he is a family member.  That probably hurts because  as much as he might care for your brother, it is YOUR brother.  You have been there for all 14 yrs of the little man's life.  You have another brother who is 8 and can't be left home alone.\n\nHas this person ever offered to purchase groceries, clean your house, watch your 8 yr old brother?  This would relieve some of the stress you and your family  are under.\n\nI think your sister went overboard.  BF probably does give her support through this crisis.\n\nShe is wrong is saying that BF can come and go as he pleases.  She does not get to decide what liberties he has, YOUR PARENTS need to set this boundary.\n\nI understand where you are coming from.  I would ask your parents what boundaries are appropriate for sister's BF.", "> and he's her guest\n\nExactly, he's a guest.not a family member,not even a family friend, a guest. He better start acting like one. NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  He may be her family but he isn't your and guests over all the time can be annoying.  She's in puppy love so ofc she took bf's side.  He prolly snitched like a bi$\\^& too.  Where's the family love there?", "Info: When you say he's always there, how often are you talking about? Is he literally there all day every day? Or is it just a few days a week? Is he there from sun up to sun down or just for dinner? Is he ever there without your sister? When he's there, is he going into your room, using the TV and other share things, or otherwise being invasive?", "NTA\n\nHe might be your sister's guest, but she's inviting him to a place you also live. This is comparable to a roommate who always has an SO over- the SO can interfere with the privacy of others in common spaces so it would not typically be considered ok to have him over constantly without talking to roommates. You have less control over the space, but you live there and have more right to the space. He is a guest. Ideally, he shouldn't be using the kitchen as a guest, either, but the polite thing would have been to wait for you to finish elsewhere anyway, as space is important in kitchens, especially while cooking and no one wants someone just watching them\n\nYou wanted to be left alone, you clearly conveyed that, he kept pushing, which is the worst thing to do when someone is stressed. He also overstepped by equating your worry with his and implying he was family- he really isn't and dating your sister won't make the rest of the family consider him as such. Your sister and bf need to realize that. And I'm not going to consider you an A H for an E S H vote when he pushed and tried to engage about a very serious subject, and you definitely are not close enough to him that it was ok to try and discuss it with you\n\nEdit: definitely not the A H with the info in the comments. This guy doesn't know boundaries, and your sister is taking advantage of your parents not being there. Furthermore, move your brother's Xbox out of the living room when your brother is in the hospital, it is not ok for your sister's bf to be messing with your brother's things. I know you don't want to bother your parents, but it sounds like they may not be ok with this and need to be roped in now.", "NTA just because every day is totally excessive, if he was there often I would understand but absolutely every day shows that he's absolutely oblivious of your boundaries. I can't imagine coming back from the hospital after visiting your sick brother and never having the space to cry or let it out. Every day is just too much.", "YTA.  \nHe was just chatting casually with you. I understand you are stressed, but he is also your sister support person. And it is nice to see him trying to be there for you too. You kinda overreacted but I guess it is understandable, but YTA nevertheless.", "> and he's her guest\n\nExactly, he's a guest. not a family member, not even a family friend, a guest. He better start acting like one. NTA", "NTA\n\nKlingons are so annoying and next to impossible to remove.", "NTA your sister wasn't there so he shouldn't be there. You are correct that you should be able to have some type of privacy if your family members aren't there. He's gotten too comfortable at your house. I think it's perfectly reasonable to ask that he only come over when he's visiting your sister or someone has invited him.", "NTA. He's a guest who has overstayed his welcome and your family is going through a stressful situation and his presence, while soothing to your sister, isn't helping. The standing around someone else's kitchen waiting for them to be done is rude. He lacks home training. Could you have said what you said in a nicer way? Absolutely. Are you stressed out? Absolutely. And way more stressed than he is. He needs to go or his visits be severely cut back. Tell your parents.", "Not a ta. People need to respect boundaries. Period", "Bud, NTA. I understand how you are feeling and you did the right thing. If they want to stay together all the time they can move out together.", "NTA\n\n\nI\u2019ve been in a similar situation and handled it much worse lol. You could have handled it better by asking him to go somewhere else while you prepared food and you\u2019d call him when the kitchen was vacant because you needed Space (physically and mentally), but it\u2019s not some unforgivable sin to snap when you\u2019re under pressure and feel like you\u2019re losing your own space to your sisters boyfriend. \n\nIt might be worth having a chat to the boyfriend and letting him know how overwhelmed you are by all this (with as much or as little detail as you want),  and that you\u2019re feeling crowded - sometimes when we feel emotionally overwhelmed and like we\u2019re suffocating, any physical imposition on our space is like someone is tightening the noose. Let him know you don\u2019t have a problem with him as a person (assuming you don\u2019t), but if you are doing something in the kitchen or doing anything related to caring for your brother or parents, you\u2019d rather be left alone. \n\nIt\u2019s tough cause this is where parents can usually set something up and you\u2019d have to listen to what they decide, but they\u2019ve got enough going on. You and your sister both need to acknowledge that as a family you\u2019re going through a really tough time and probably don\u2019t have your usual levels of patience / tolerance, and are just trying to get through this. Maybe she needs him to help her get through it. But there needs to be some communication between you two of what you can and can\u2019t handle right now and trying to be respectful of each others emotional needs\u2026 which means she can\u2019t call you a \u201cmean bitter douchebag\u201d because you told her boyfriend to gtfo\u2026. The whole two wrongs don\u2019t make a right thing\u2026\n\nSorry, that got long. Best of luck to your brother and family", "NTA. He's worn out his welcome. Your sister can go hang out at his house, if having him around is really that important.", "NTA. There is an illness in the family, and everyone is stressed. Your sister's boyfriend should realize that this isn't the time to be visiting. He should invite your sister over to his house or at the very least, cut his visits down a bit so the family can decompress in private.", "> and he's her guest\n\nExactly, he's a guest.not a family member,not even a family friend, a guest. He better start acting like one. NTA", "I\u2019m going with NTA. I felt with this in high school. My parents were divorcing and my sister had her BF over all the time. He was eating everything in the kitchen. Hogging the tv. Spending forever in the bathroom. He would try to make small talk sometimes but it was hard. I felt like I could never get away from from them and have alone time unless I locked myself in my room. yeah you shouldn\u2019t have snapped at him but I can see why you are so frustrated. My sister used her BF to deal with the stress and didn\u2019t care if everyone else in the house was unhappy. why can\u2019t they spend time over at her BF house?", "NTA\n\nIt's ok that's he's comfortable, but hes crossing the line when he doesn't give you the space you need around the kitchen and such. \n\nNow one thing to consider, since your sister is 17, I assume he's 17 as well... he's very immature still.", "NTA: First off, sorry to hear about your brother- hope he recovers and returns home soon!\n\nDefinitely understand feeling like you/your family have no privacy as just the family.\n\nAlso understand your sister wanting her guest to feel welcomed \n\nSounds like tensions and emotions are running high (understandably) in the household right now.\n\nI think he was genuinely trying to be helpful in asking if you wanted help making the meal you were going to bring to your parents and his sentiment about family sticking together- poor choice of words perhaps since he isn't legally family but either he views all of you as family or was just trying to convey that he cares about all of you and is also worried.  I think you snapped at him a bit harshly but I 100% understand why \n\nPerhaps bring this up to your sister and your parents if you all get a moment to be together (difficult now considering the hospitalization I realize)  She has a right to have guests but you also have a right to feel comfortable in your own home.  Hopefully your parents will consider both sides and come to a decision everyone can live peacefully with.", "NTA. Your family is very stressed and probably don\u2019t need another teenager hanging around. It\u2019s nice if he wants to be supportive but more importantly he needs to be respectful of your boundaries.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister seems to believe the length of her relationship is equivalent to being married. However, he\u2019s not her husband. Besides that, your parents may not have the space to run herd on how much time the bf is spending in your home. You may not feel as though you have the authority to tell her she can\u2019t have him around, but she only has him there with your parents\u2019 lack of disapproval.", "NTA, he doesn't live there, he should not be able to just walk in. If he is there for his GF, she should be there with him.", "YTA \n\nSorry but it's not your house so you don't make the rules. It sounds like he was doing what he usually does and is also there to support your sister. He even offered to help you out. Calm down.", "You should have talked to your sister or parents about boundaries regarding guests in the house. But blowing up in the moment happens sometimes, especially when you are stressed out. It\u2019s understandable that you want your space even if your brother wasn\u2019t ill. \n\nI\u2019m going to say soft ESH.

Your parents are probably thankful that she has someone to help her through this time.  You and your parents aren't the only one dealing with your brother's illness.  He was right that you are taking your anger out on him.  Why not be smart about this?  If he is around that much, enlist him to help you with the household.  He does not cook, but he can try.  He can watch siblings with your sister, etc.  It is your parents' house and they make the rules, not you.  Yes, you are really being TA.", "[removed]", "Are you the AH because you told him if he wanted to make food to go use his kitchen?  No.  But YTA for saying he not a member of the family.

He may not be technically family, but that may not be how your parents feel, your sister or any other sibling for that matter.  And what if your sister married this boyfriend?  He may not be blood, but most people look at some friends as family regardless.  This may be no different.\n\nTwo, it's not just your house.

Yeah, it's frustrating working in a kitchen with people getting in the way.

I am not saying don't help or be there for your hospitalized brother but just to get a small break from a stressful routine.

So I somewhat understand being angry. It's understandable, especially if he's there every day like you say. \n\nHowever, it's not like he spit in your face and kicked you in the shins. He seemed genuinely concerned, feels he is part of the family, and he offered help. If he was an asshole I'd understand, but he seems like a genuinely good guy. I'd apologize and maybe see if he can go back to his own place some days out of the week, so you can reclaim some of your space. I'd go crazy without my own space too.", "YTA- your sister has been with him for awhile and he's probably her support system, especially right now.

It sounds like OP's sister is going through a really hard time if she's not coming out of her room or wanting to eat, so it's not surprising that her boyfriend is there to try and help her through it. Also the fact that their parents are so absent makes it pretty clear there's not a lot of support for OP's sister so all the more reason her boyfriend would be there as much as possible.\n\nIf OP has a real problem with it he should be talking to his parents, not treating his sister's boyfriend like he's some random interloper with zero vested interest in the family.

So freaking weird! Idt you\u2019re in the wrong at all. He needs to read the room. \n\nNTA", "NTA This post is full of people with no boundaries and extreme entitlement.\n\nE: wording", "NTA", "NTA. \nThe bf is 17 and obviously still needs lots of manners taught by whoever is responsible for him at his own home. He has zero clue what boundaries are and that he is overstepping them greatly. I know you mentioned you don't want to bother your parents with it, but I think your sister aswell as her bf need the friendly reminder that it's not his home by your parents.", "A lot of people haven't had someone invading their space on the daily, and it shows.\n\nI completely understand where OP is coming from, and since when is it okay for anyone's partner to come into a family home and raid their fridge and use other people's things? I sure as fuck wouldn't be okay with this. I don't care how close you are with my sibling. It's not your place to get that comfortable regardless of age. It's not cute and it has never been cute to be a leech. \n\nPeople deserve to have some space, especially during tough times, and it really sounds like the sister's boyfriend was crossing some boundaries by getting too comfortable. Maybe he didn't mean it with ill intent, but there is such a thing as over staying your welcome. It's not an asshole thing to just want some peace and quiet.\n\nSo my verdict is NTA even though I know I'm gonna get down voted but I've been through similar situations and until you have someone getting in your space you won't understand how fucking invasive it feels.", "NTA. He\u2019s 17, so it\u2019s kind of hard to blame him, but his social I.Q. seems to be in negative numbers. This is a really tense time for your family, and he should know that that\u2019s not a situation in which he should be overstaying his welcome. I\u2019d be as annoyed as you are.\n\nI\u2019m keeping a good thought for your brother, and I hope things turn out well for him.", "NTA. OP\u2019s family is clearly in crisis and having some irritating teen hanging around 24/7 adds additional stress. OP should have a conversation with his parents about limiting the time daughter\u2019s BF is there since BF is too inconsiderate to limit time spent at their home on his own. Frankly OP\u2019s sister needs to operate more considerately toward her family as well.", "Everyone is scared and struggling. This kid feels like he\u2019s part of the family bc he\u2019s been treated like he\u2019s part of the family. \nIt sounds like he is also worried about OP\u2019s brother, and is trying to be sensitive and helpful, even though OP is increasingly making it clear he wants the kid gone. \nOP, my heart goes out to you. I\u2019m sorry you and your family are going through this. I\u2019m going to say, though, that YTA. I say it gently. This kid is part of the family now, if only provisionally/maybe temporarily. He was trying to be sensitive and empathic. I think he\u2019s right   you are taking out your fear and stress on him. I hope things get better soon for everyone.", "Look, I get you\u2019re worried about your brother, but the boyfriend is allowed to be worried too. He\u2019s been around your brother for two years now. You can\u2019t gate keep worry for your brother. While yes, YTA here I hope everything works out for your family. Especially your little brother. Apologize to the boyfriend and hang in there. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a lot right now.", "You're holding a lot of resentment for a person who by your own account is simply...existing. Yes its in your home, but he was invited to be there by another member of your household. He isn't actively hurting you, you just find him rather annoying. At a certain point he needs to stay out of your way to not aggravate you since you're so unwelcoming. That's a clash of personalities but it doesn't quite cross any lines...until...\n\nHe expressed feelings of grief for your brother in the hospital and you told him he isn't family. Technically, true, but I've seen entire cities riot when their sports team wins/loses the finals. This is where I drew the line at YTA. Quit locking him out. He's trying to play nice and you tried to take his ball and throw it onto the roof. Why do you hate him this much?", "YTA. He\u2019s been around seriously for 2 years. At what point do you expect to treat him as part of the family?", "Your the ass hole, like swamp ass- ass hole, itchy snd annoying, really you are the worst type. Be better OP\u2026.", "Nope. That's not a good excuse to lash out at a kid...\n\nIDC how hard things have been, you have to control your shit better. \n\nHe offered to help cook, and OP lashed out on him and thought \"he doesn't even know how to cook\". You could have asked him to help chop, slice, clean, fetch something.. but instead OP decided to be an AH.   \nAnd if OP is uncomfortable with him 'always being here', then maybe have a civil conversation with the sister instead of trying to scare him away? \n\nOP, YTA. This kid isn't the crux of your problems, and you know it.", "exactly! Idk why so many people are treating this  bf like a child when he\u2019s not much younger than OP and then acting like OP is supposed to be 100% perfect adult just because he\u2019s 21\u2026 21 is still young and 17 is old enough to less immature", "I mean, it's pretty ballsy (and AH behavior) to walk into *someone else's house* and standing in someone's way while making food and then saying your waiting for them to be done so that you can make food for yourself...", "When the BF said he was waiting for OP to be done with food prep so he could fix food for himself.

He doesn't have any sense of boundaries NTA", "it is his house, he lives there, \"your house your rules\" is not about ownership, it's about residency, if you visit someone that is renting their house it is \"their house their rules\".\n\nAs a resident he outranks his sister BF that is only a guest, as the legal adult (21) to his sister minor (17) he outranks her on the subject of guests.\n\nBasically, out of the people in this story, he does make the rules.", "Oh this parasite is polite and nice. No reason to throw it out. NTA", "Where are this kids parents/what is the deal with his home life? Is there a reason he can\u2019t be home, or is it simply him capitalizing on a parent-less house and getting to hang out with his gf all day?", "I get the scenario sucks for both parties in this type of situation. But it should highlight the extraordinary people that recognize the circumstances and still bring a neglected latchkey kid into the family fold. \n\nThat is something special", "it prob was one of the first comments and it keeps getting liked by people who didn't read the whole post or pay attention to other comments where op fully explains how much of a loser the bf is.", "17 and 21, both adults legally...young adults sure", "No, fuck that, BF needs to learn to shut the fuck up and leave people alone, IMHO OP should have kicked him out of the house.\n\nHis sister is only 17 so technically She has no legal say so OP could just all the cops on him for trespassing and his sisters invite wouldn't matter as she is a minor.", "'adult to a teenager' is a stretch when they're 17 and 21", "That's not how it works, bud. The police wouldn't consider the bf tresspassing unless the homeowner says so. OP is not the homeowner, his parents are.

My parents\u2019 rule was when they weren\u2019t home my sister was in charge. That authority was given to my sister. She didn\u2019t just take it.  Being in charge comes with more responsibilities than it does privileges so OP should think really hard about whether he wants to become a surrogate parent to a 17 year old.", "It says the sister got home 20 minutes later which seems to imply the bf was loitering in the house while his gf wasn\u2019t even there. I would be annoyed like OP too", "Where did you read that", "1-he is not a child, and he is old enough to understand, come on, he is not a potato\r  \n\r  \n2-OP said that he clearly does not leave the house, so saying that he was there to support is nonsense, he just followed his routine of being at someone else's house all the time", "Except OP has become the default head of household since his parents are never there. His parents don\u2019t even have a clue this kid is coming over every day, eating their food, playing their sick child\u2019s PlayStation.

Every single day he has to see and put up with this person he doesn\u2019t like, constantly in his space. Have you never had a person you just couldn\u2019t stand constantly being around, all the time?

Not to even mention was OP has going on in his own life.", "OP is a guy.", "The offer to help followed by the statement that he\u2019ll wait to make us own implies to offer to help OP make their food was to either 1) mooch OPs food or 2) speed along the process so they could make their own food faster.", "And you and I know his sister will be (most likely) PISSSSSED. I think the better move is to let the parents know OP needs space and have them address the boyfriend situation.", "It says she \u201ccame down twenty minutes later,\u201d presumably from her bedroom.", "Op said the parents don't want him to sleep in the house. They are not often home so they don't know the bf is saying so much.", "There\u2019s a level of comfort that you can get in your home, even if it\u2019s not complete privacy. Having a guest there breaks that. Though OP may also be looking for actual privacy \u2014 he writes of wanting to be able to break down, to express the pain he feels, and he\u2019s had to try to hold things together around his younger siblings who are at home. If they\u2019re both in their rooms, his own bedroom may be too close, so he goes to the living room and finds he can\u2019t break down there either because his sister\u2019s boyfriend is hanging out playing games.", "Honestly, this was my read on it too. I guess you might have to be someone that works in the kitchen a fair amount to read this situation and think this kid is trying make a point that isn\u2019t his place to make. I felt like standing there waiting for him to be done was passive aggressive. It\u2019s meant to put pressure on the person already there to hurry up and get out of their way. It\u2019s kind of territorial behavior. Problem is, that isn\u2019t the bf\u2019s house or kitchen. OP was harsh and could have been nicer but this kid is either dense af or purposely not taking a hint and showing some defiance against someone else\u2019s boundaries at a pretty damned inappropriate time.", "It's rude af to stand in the kitchen waiting for someone to finish cooking so you can use the space. Wait somewhere else, don't stand in their way", "OP should have made him a knuckle sandwich \ud83d\ude02", "Exactly.. like read the fin room AH.. you\u2019re not \u201chelping\u201d gtfo", "Updated the shes to hes.", "replying to second this, the boyfriend wanted to steal (harsh but technically true) food from people who are caring for their sick son in the hospital after already staying in their home without their knowing.

So that's points kinda void", "Ok but it really isn\u2019t that easy at 21 just to get your own house\u2026 idk why people in this sub always treat anyone barely over 18 as a fully grown adult who can suddenly get their own home whenever they want - even though they are legally an adult it\u2019s obviously not as simple as that", "Its his home too. He lives there.", "Given that the 21-year-old takes care of the 8-year-old after making food to take to his parents at the hospital looking after their 14-year-old,I'd say he's more than qualified to deal with the situation at hand.\n\nSomeone should have laid down some new rules at least when the kid was hospitalized. If sis needs emotional support so much, she can get a turtle or go stay at the boyfriend's house. I don't see any sign that she's useful at all in this stressful time.\n\nIn case I haven't made it clear, NTA.", "His sister didn't even come downstairs for 20 minutes after OP told him to go. Who knows when she was going to wake up. The guest is acting like it's his space walking in without express invitation. Absolutely not. He is allowed to be annoyed and to request he leave instead of being over constantly. Sister should go to the boyfriends occasionally if they want to spend every minute together.", "Disgusting leech? Lmao Jesus christ dude calm down", "You can hear the parents talking in that quote", "Dude he's an adult. Stop telling him to resent his parents for spending time with their sick child, he's fine", "You're the one that called him disgusting.\n\nI just called him a leech for taking advantage of a family in tragedy.", "Yes he does. The kid is being an ass and is getting in OPs way. Op lives in the home and doesnt matter if hes 21 or 30 or 12.
