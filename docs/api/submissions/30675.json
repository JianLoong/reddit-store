{"id": 30675, "submission_id": "17rmbbg", "title": "AITA for not letting my daughter borrow my car for 3 days near Christmas?", "selftext": "My daughter is 19, goes to school and lives 100 miles away, and got her drivers' licence half a year ago. I reckon' she's driven about 6-700 miles by now. The few times I've been in the passenger seat, she's driven very safely. Now she wants to borrow the car for 3 days, for two purposes: delivering a big load of goods for a party she's arranging (otherwise it's many back-breaking trips to the supermarket via bus, she informs me), and secondly, two days later, to drive her classmate home for the holidays and later, on the same-day return drive, visit a friend from her public school before reaching us, for Christmas.\r  \n\r  \nThat final drive is some 230 miles, twice the distance she's driven before without adult supervision, and it's into our capital, a congested urban area whereas she's only driven in the country before. I worry that she and her friend will engage in banter and play loud music and be generally too unaware of the highway traffic surrounding them, and I worry that someone will crash into them, and I worry how much snow and ice there will be on the roads by then, conditions she's never faced. Basic parent's worries.\r  \n\r  \nThose 3 days would deprive us - wife and I - of our car for shopping and/or other affairs. I use the car to get to work every day, so that's 3 days where I would have to spend 3 hours on commute via busses and trains, as opposed to 1 hour via car. Also, in case something happens to that car, I'd be difficult to ever find a similiar 2009 Renault Megane with just 40k miles to its name (we were practically gifted it when my wife's grand-mother passed). The car is insured, but only for the symbolic amount I paid for it and securing another car would wipe out my savings. Furthermore my wife would have to find different means of transportation for getting to my in-laws, to help arrange the traditional family Christmas get-together - and they do live in the outskirts of the country and it'll be quite a planes-trains-automobiles situation for her, I fear.\r  \n\r  \nI told my daughter no. Told her I would drive up and assist with the deliveries to the party, and stick around for as long as she/they needed to make sure no further deliveries were needed. But that she and her classmate should arrange to travel together by train for as long as possible until reaching their individual destinations, for the trip two days after the party. Not that it matters, but I've always paid for her public transportation so it would cost her.\r  \n\r  \nShe is upset with me for not allowing her use of the car over those 3 days. I believe I could be the asshole for not allowing her to grow as a driver, and also for caring more about how the rest of the family and I would fare without a reliable car - when in all likelyhood, if I were to allow it, it would probably go fine and she would have a great time driving around and grow as a driver and a youth. \r  \n\r  \nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1699561998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rmbbg/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_borrow_my_car/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's no way you're an asshole for saying no so that your daughter can do someone a favor.  She shouldn't think it's ok to make your life difficult to help her friend.", "NTA. It's going to seriously inconvenience yourself and your wife. And the extra stress and worry of wondering if your daughter is safe on top of Christmas is something you can do without. Your compromise offer is more than generous.", "Of course you are NTA. It's your car,  and you need it. You offered to help her, that was generous. She is old enough to use public transportation and make her own arrangements, including asking friends or hiring a driver.", "NTA.  So, you and your wife are supposed to inconvenience yourselves for her.  You offered to help with groceries/party.  Where is her friend's contribution for transportation?", "NTA. You offered reasonable accommodations to your daughter that would cause the least disruption to you and your wife while helping your daughter.", "NTA. She's 19, she can get her own car and drive it wherever she wants. If you still feel guilty about it just give her enough money to rent a car for three days.", "NTA. Your compromise is reasonable and thoughtful. Your insurance, however, is short-sighted. Used cars are really expensive right now - insure for replacement value if you can't afford to replace the car.", "NAH - I think you made a generous compromise.", "NTA for your stated reasons.  She can save and get her own vehicle.  Borrowing your vehicle is a privilege not a right.", "NTA - any does she needs to drive her friend home when she doesn\u2019t even have her own car yet", "NTA. It is a huge ask to ask to borrow someone\u2019s car and leave them without transportation for several days, especially when they only need it for a convenience. You are completely justified in saying \u201cno,\u201d and your daughter needs to consider the impact her favor would have on your lives before she gets upset at you.", "Cold weather driving is not for the novice. NTA. \nWhen she can afford her own car she can drive herself anywhere she wants. \n\nThe inconvenience to you is also unacceptable.", "I would just ask her how she expects you to get around during those days. The answer is no unless she can provide transportation for for your family", "NAH. You and your spouse having no car just before Christmas just isn't reasonable. \n\nIf you had a spare car, I'd say risk it.  But that's just too much imposition.", "NTA but I would suggest letting her borrow the car and you guys get a rental. She is 19 so not a child anymore and she needs to learn to drive longer distances at some point.

Your reasoning is solid. Don\u2019t let yourself be guilted into this risk.", "NTA It\u2019s too much for her to ask you and your wife to take buses for those days.", "NTA - it is your only vehicle", "Clear NTA. That\u2019s unreasonable to inconvenience you since you use your car to get to work and the alternative commute isn\u2019t remotely practical. She would be inconveniencing you, the car owner, far more than she benefits from the use of the car. Until she can buy herself a car, she can try to rent a car or research alternatives that don\u2019t cause a massive inconvenience to her family. Something tells me that she\u2019s not being honest about the purpose of asking for the car", "I wouldn't loan my kid a completely spare car with all the big city and party related tasks ahead of her....", "NTA. Commuting for three hours to work when you have a car is insane.  I think your offer was more than fair.", "NTA. It's your car, and I would be nervous letting a new driver loose with my car on such a long trip. But the main point is that it would inconvenience you. You've offered a very nice substitute for the party-hauling. She is not entitled to deprive you of your wheels during a busy time.", "Three days is a long time to give up the household car.  \n\nNTA", "NTA.  She doesn't have the proper experience driving, especially in snowy conditions, to be using your car for that time. Add to that the inconvenience to you and your wife.  You have provided a workable solution.  She can practice driving in the snow when she is at home for the holidays. Then, if she wants to borrow your car, you will have more confidence in her experience.", "*I worry that she and her friend will engage in banter and play loud music*\n\nNo! Not banter and loud music! Anything but that!\n\nNTA.", "Earlier this year, my adult daughter borrowed my paid off car. She drove it over a mini boulder. Now, I have a car payment again.\n\nNTA", "NTA - the fact that she\u2019d be seriously inconveniencing you is enough, but add in driving in challenging conditions (city traffic and snow) as an inexperienced driver and that would be a hard no from me also.", "If it\u2019s your only car and you need it, there isn\u2019t really anything else needs saying. She must realise how unreasonable her request is.", "Rent a car and let her use yours", "NTA.  Tell your daughter about these magical places called \"car rental agencies\".", "NTA\nShe does not have the experience for a lengthy trip in difficult weather to an unfamiliar location. It's a safety issue.", "NTA. In Colorado new adolescent drivers have to practice driving for a year before they can get their license, and then they are restricted to only driving family members for another 6 months. I definitely understand your concern about her trip with her friend. However, if you think she still needs to learn, let her drive on the party run, and go with her to talk her through it.", "NTA. You decided you shouldn't do it for whatever reasons. Her making promises she can't keep is not your problem.", "I had kind parents who let me borrow their cars - but not to the point that they had to find alternative transportation to work!\n\nThat's a huge ask and I don't have a problem with you saying no.\n\nI will note that where I live, as a parent you would have to add your daughter as an authorized driver to your insurance or the insurance wouldn't kick in if something happened while she was behind the wheel. And inexperienced drivers will increase your insurance rate.\n\nObviously, as you are driving a Renault (my first car was an Renault!), you don't live in the US, so rules will differ.\n\nNTA", "Well said. Not to mention all the other totally valid reasons not to give her the car.", "She\u2019s not old enough to have a rental. You must be 25 to be eligible to drive a rental", "This right there is the problem with the post. Accidents happen and the OP can't replace his car if it does., That's not insurance, that's an ineffectively mitigated risk.", "That\u2019s no longer true", "It's 18 in NY but yes obviously they should follow their local laws.", "They aren't in the US, there haven't been Renaults (French cars) here for over 30 years. Their local rules will obviously vary.", "NTA.  It simply isn\u2019t convenient.  But you should spend a significant portion of her holiday allowing her to drive under all of the conditions you fear.  She needs the opportunity and experience to grow as a driver.  That way it is only the convenience that is a factor in the future, and not your fears.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t sacrifice for her made up plan she informed you of. You also gave her other solutions.\n\nWhat if you all have an emergency?\n\nWhy can\u2019t she rent a car?", "NTA you gave her a compromise for the transport of goods. All other of her trips are fun trips and they don't top your and your wife's need for the car.\n\nIf she wants to drive around, she check if there is a car rental willing to rent to a 19 year old.", "nta", "NTA. You are concerned about her safety, and if you don\u2019t feel she\u2019s ready, go with your gut. Especially if it inconveniences you, risks your savings, and there are alternatives like the train.", "NTA", "NTA because you need the car to get to work. Work beats out everything.", "NTA.", "NTA  She's okay with you, the owner of the car, taking public transport but she can't? She's a little mixed up.", "If it was my daughter, I would maybe let her take the car and get a rental for myself for a few days!", "Nope, NTA here.", "NTA. \nNope! You have listed all the reasons that the answer should be no. And as much as it sucks that she is upset over it, part of being an adult is dealing with things that don't make you happy.  Accidents happen and she would have absolutely no way to replace the car if she had an accident on the slick roads and the car got totaled. This is, from the sounds of it, your only vehicle. When and if she has the ability to buy a car, pay the insurance & upkeep and gas then she doesn't need to be driving her friends all over to deliver them for the holidays. Explain everything you said here to her and hopefully she understands. If not then she certainly isn't mature enough to handle the responsibilities of using someone else's car for 3 days.", "NTA even though she's a good driver, it's coming up to the silly season! And not all drivers, drive with the same amount of care. And even if it wasn't the silly season you still are NTA, a 3 hour commute to work is ridiculous.", "But what about the party?  Don\u2019t you care about the party?"]}
