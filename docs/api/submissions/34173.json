Then she sent me a funny video of the daughter saying hello , to which I saved in the Snapchat chat and laughed at , saying how much she looked like her mother !\n\nThen on New Year\u2019s Eve she was as sending me drunk snaps of her with others calling me all sorts of slurs so I decided to remove her as it wasn\u2019t serious enough to warrant that.\n\nThen yesterday she messaged me being very bitchy and saying loads of stuff again, I just ignored it and played it off as a immature lady , then she said \u201c don\u2019t save snaps of a child you\u2019ve never met \u201c\n\nNow phrasing it that way was I thought an asshole move, firstly she had sent the snap asking the child to say hi to me and it was funny, secondly it wasn\u2019t her child to say such and take that viewpoint.\n\nTo confirm the snap was saved in the chat amongst loads of other photos she had sent", "created_utc": 1704185000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wkt4f/aita_for_saving_a_snap_someone_sent_me_of_their/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
