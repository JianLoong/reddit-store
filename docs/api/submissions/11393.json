It\u00b4s been 8 years and we have a good relationship we co-parent really good and we have both remarried since then. My son lives full time with me, my husband (44M) and my stepson (17M) because my son\u2019s dad lives in another country, my son talks to his dad everyday though and also visits him twice a year.\n\nMy ex is doing great financially, he and his hubby have high paying jobs which means they can afford things me and my husband can\u2019t, my son doesn\u2019t miss anything because his dad provides for him, so, recently my ex gifted my son a brand-new car, my stepson was very jealous and begged us to buy him a car  but right now we are not in a position where we could afford it not even my and my husband\u2019s car is as expensive as my son\u2019s. My husband asked me to compromise and not show favoritism since his son was having already a hard time having his mom not involved in his life, so I decided to do this: my son can use it Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday so I told him that he\u2019ll use the car those days and let my stepson use it the other days my son refused at first and told me that it wasn\u2019t mine to decide but I could convince him.\n\nThe thing is that my stepson took the car on a day that wasn\u2019t supposed to be his and got it damaged because it was hit by another car  and my son got mad and called his father, his dad called me back and confronted me calling me the AH for \u201cforcing\u201d my son to share his car, now my ex told my son to store his car at my former in laws where my stepson can\u2019t touch it, now my son is mad at me and is refusing to talk to me he wants to move in with his grandparents up until he finishes high school and can move in with his dad, it hurts, my son is also mad at me because his dad won\u2019t pay to have it fixed, he can but he says he won\u2019t because my son should have told him that I was making him share the car so he could\u00b4ve prevented it.", "created_utc": 1677869957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hbki2/aita_for_making_my_son_and_stepson_share_a_car/", "score": 153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's admirable.  However the fact that your husband and your ex-husband are in different economic levels was destined to result in this kind of difficulty, and it will only get more difficult as the boys get older.

You should have discussed this in depth with your ex and your son, to see if any kind of middle ground could be found.  But you knew it was an asshole move to force your son to share his car, so you didn't... hoping it would be okay.

It was not you choice to make.", "YTA, the car wasn't yours to give.", "YTA HUGELY, why would a car gifted from his father have anything to do with your stepson or your husband who asked to compromise, Regardless of that you can not just give away presents and i seriously doubt you \"convinced\" your son because if he refused at first why would he agree to that", "YTA. Life isn\u2019t fair. You, your husband and your step son need to suck it up. It\u2019s your son\u2019s care and therefore he gets to decide who uses it and when", "YTA. It\u2019s not your car.

Then you tell your step son that \u201csorry, he got it from his dad. We can\u2019t afford something like that.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s one thing if your son wants to let his step brother borrow his car every once in a while. But that\u2019s not the case..\n\nYou, your husband and your step son needs to get that car fixed. I can only imagine how your son feels. Not only did you rob him of a gift he got from his dad, that he only sees in person twice a year, but you managed to break it too, by taking it from him. \n\nAbsolutely TA", "YTA!!!

He took the car on a day that wasn't \"his\" and got into an accident. You need to do some serious apologizing. To your son and to your ex-. And yes, that probably means you and DH need to pay to get the car fixed now. Admit to your Ex- that you pressured Son into agreeing to share the car. \n\nAnd part of all of this is punishing SS for taking the car when he shouldn't've. Cuz I've noticed that isn't mentioned. Maybe part of that punishment is paying you and DH back for the cost of repairs but putting off the repairs isn't okay. This happened because of your decisions. \n\nYour sons are going to get different opportunities. Yes, it's terrible that Stepson's mom has opted not to be part of his life but you know what? That isn't your son's fault. And it never means that SS has a right to Son's things. Yes, you and DH should make sure that you guys provide equally for the boys.

Do either you or he grasp how serious this is? \n\nGiven that you haven't mentioned an insurance company at all, I assume that the \"damage by being hit by another car\" was a parking lot thing, where your stepson parked the car, and came back to find that it had been scraped by another car, which had absconded, so you couldn't claim against the other driver's insurance.", "YTA- It\u2019s NOT your car and you don\u2019t get to dictate its use.

Your son's car was purchased by his father, so your husband understood he had no say in the matter, and knew that you would do anything to make him and your new son happy. So, instead of doing the right thing and telling your husband that it was not your nor his automobile to make decisions or rules about, you made your son give his car to your new son to make your husband and your new son happy not caring about your son's feelings since they mean nothing to you.\n\nIt is evident that either you or your husband told your son not to inform his father about you forcing him to give his car to your new son, either by threatening to take away the keys or by handing the car to your new son or your husband since you knew that your EX would've put a stop to it, which is why it went on for so long.\n\nOn the positive side, you now have the ideal family and will be able to devote your full attention to your new son and make him happy.", "YTA stepson, you and hubby.  I know you wanted to show that you loved them equally, but isn't it part of raising a child to prepare them for imbalances and disappointment?

When I say sincerely, I mean sincerely, if you can't be sincere, I can see why he wants to go to his grandparents. You made a big mistake, own it apologize and allow your son to see you take responsibility for your mistakes. You also need to sit with the stepson and tell him he is NOT allowed to use the car anymore.

Were you hoping for some validation here to show your son an ex? \n\nAnd what made you think this was fair? We see this crap all the time. Parents forcing kids to share things with step/halfsibling that was given specifically to them by another family member in the interest of FaIrNEsS and FaMiLy!! And then wondering why the kid who's stuff was taken away wants to get as far away from them as possible.\n\nGuess what. It wasn't fair. And now he has to wait for you to fix it. I hope his dad takes you to court. You need to take out a loan and get the stepson to get a job to pay it off. Fix your son's car and your attitude before you lose him", "YTA\n\nIt's not a compromise to let your stepson use your son's car.

That was your son\u2019s car-not yours!  You have zero say in who drives it!", "If your sons father gives him money for college or gifts him a house to live in are you going to make him share his college money with his stepbrother and make him let him move into the house if he wants to?

It\u00b4s been 8 years and we have a good relationship we co-parent really good and we have both remarried since then. My son lives full time with me, my husband (44M) and my stepson (17M) because my son\u2019s dad lives in another country, my son talks to his dad everyday though and also visits him twice a year. \n\nMy ex is doing great financially, he and his hubby have high paying jobs which means they can afford things me and my husband can\u2019t, my son doesn\u2019t miss anything because his dad provides for him so recently my ex gifted my son a brand-new car, my stepson was very jealous and begged us to buy him a car  but right now we are not in a position where we could afford it not even my and my husband\u2019s car is as expensive as my son\u2019s. My husband asked me to compromise and not show favoritism since his son was having already a hard time having his mom not involved in his life, so I decided to do this: my son can use it Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday so I told him that he\u2019ll use the car those days and let my stepson use it the other days my son refused at first and told me that it wasn\u2019t mine to decide but I could convince him. \n\nThe thing is that my stepson took the car on a day that wasn\u2019t supposed to be his and got it damaged because it was hit by another car  and my son got mad and called his father, his dad called me back and confronted me calling me the AH for \u201cforcing\u201d my son to share his car, now my ex told my son to store his car at my former in laws where my stepson can\u2019t touch it, now my son is mad at me and is refusing to talk to me he wants to move in with his grandparents up until he finishes high school and can move in with his dad, it hurts, my son is also mad at me because his dad won\u2019t pay to have it fixed, he can but he says he won\u2019t because my son should have told him that I was making him share the car so he could\u00b4ve prevented it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It would be one thing if you had a more 50/50 custody split and ex could keep son's car at ex's house, but that's not the case.  He knows you and your husband are raising his child and are doing so with another kid the exact same age in the household and probably couldn't afford to get that kid a car.  Ex shouldn't do things that are guaranteed to cause friction in your household just to feel like a good (but absent) dad.  He should have waited until your son was 18 and going to college or whatever's next to get him that car.\n\nThat said, once it was given, it belonged to your son.  It was not yours (or your husband's) to make rules about or to insist son had to share it with stepson.\n\nStepson should not have taken the car without permission.  It's not clear if he contributed to the accident or not other than the fact that the car likely wouldn't have been where it was if he hadn't taken it.\n\nI think the solution of storing the car at the grandparents' house is a good one.", "ESH.  You and your stepson stole the car, but before that, your ex buying your son a car that would be kept at your house is something you rightfully have veto power over.", "ESH. You didn\u2019t buy the car and it was not a gift for your stepson. Your ex created the problem by buying an expensive car when he knew you could not do the same for stepson.

Badly written and generic ass story", "YTA\n\nIt was not your car to share with your step son. Your ex purchased that for HIS child, not some other man\u2019s.

You don\u2019t have a say, your ex bought this car **for your son** not your step son.

Correct your mistake", "You and your ex are the parents of your son. You should be making decisions together about him. If there were issues with a gift, you should have discussed that with your ex or encouraged your son to do so. Instead, you came up with something that benefitted your husband and his son at a cost to your son and his relationship with his father. \n\nYou also made a decision about property that did not belong to you and that you may not have the resources to repair if damaged. You clearly overstepped and are most definitely in the wrong. \n\nYou, your husband, and his son should be funding any repairs to the car. That is the minimum of what you should do to repair the damage you caused. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You took something that was not yours to give to placate the envy of a 17 year old.

Of course your son is upset, as he should be.", "You can\u2019t seriously have typed all of that out and still be unable to tell YTA.

Legally your stepson had no business being behind the wheel. Your ex can now sue you and your husband for the damages. \n\nIt was NOT the stepsons car! You had ZERO right to it.

You and your husband are obligated to pay for the repairs now, since it was both of you who are responsible for allowing this sharing arrangement in the first place.", "YTA. Family dynamics can be tough when there are multiple family units connected, but your ex bought his son a car, so why do you think it's okay to give your step-son access to something that doesn't belong to either of you? It would have been okay to say that neither gets to have a car, and tell the bio-dad that a car is off limits.", "YTA. \n\nIt's amazing how quickly people volunteer other people's stuff. \n\nThe appropriate compromise is for you or your husband to share your vehicle with your stepson. Thats fair. Those are items you own and are financially responsible for. Need a car for work? Carpool. Have stepson drive you. Figure it out. \n\nTeaching Stepson that he has the right to take away someone else's property or gift teaches him nothing about fairness. It takes responsibility away and ownership. Now when something bad happens you double down and teach stepson that he isn't responsible for his actions and you, his parent, isnt responsible for him either. Someone else is. \n\nIt's your job to teach your children life isn't fair. Some people get a silver spoon. Others get a reused disposable plastic spoon.

You had zero right to make your son share the car. Why is there no insurance on the car?

This was a gift to your  son by his father. It wasn't you who made that purchase, it was the other parent. I know this was hurting for your stepson. But this was something to be talked out together.  Whether or not his mom is involved, jealousy isn't healthy. \n\nYou should have talked to your son and step son about it first. You should also have asked your ex about how they view it and considering what this could mean for insurance. You could have asked your son whether he would agree to share it with step son. This would have been better for their bond as well. \n\nYour ex should actually have discussed such a purchase with you beforehand. Perhaps this is my European head where gifting cars just isn't the norm.  Such purchases should be discussed between parents. \n\nFor the rest, your sons reaction might indicate that there are more things he is unhappy with. Time to start a conversation and see what else is up there. \n\nAs for your step son, he clearly crossed the line. He took  it on a day he was not supposed to. Now it's his job to pay for the repairs and make it up. \n\nTime for a family talk", "YTA. For forcing your son to share a gift from his father with someone who is nothing to his father. An expensive gift too. I\u2019m sure your step son does feel shitty living with someone who gets whatever they want from their rich dad, but I\u2019m staying out of that one.", "YTA. And I honestly cannot think of why you would believe otherwise.\n\nThe car did not belong to you or stepson.  Period.  In blended families, sometimes life isn't fair.\n\nAnd why is stepson not repairing the car on his own dime?  If he is entitled to use it without the owner's permission, he is certainly responsible for the cost of repairs needed when he was using the car.\n\nI'm honestly baffled by why this is an issue of dispute.\n\nThe car is son's.\n\nThe stepson caused damage. The stepson pays to repair it.", "YTA and you better pay for the repairs wtf", "Yta", "YTA. It\u2019s your kids car from his dad. It\u2019s not a shared car. There\u2019s no need to be fair. The situation sucks for the stepson, sure, with his mom out of the picture and you not being able to afford a car for him. He can do what so many other teens do - work, save up, pay for his own car.  His having possession of the car at any time when your son did not ok it is thievery.", "YTA. IT. IS. NOT. YOUR. CAR. If you cant afford a car for your stepson he doesn't get a car.

Stepson can have whatever and only what the household can afford. If you and your husband had never gotten together, this would still be true. You owe your son a huge apology. You and your husband need to pay for the vehicle to be fixed.", "No, what you did show your son is that you are completely okay with treating him unfairly if that meant keeping you stepson happy. That is the lesson here, that\u2019s is what you did and what your son will always remember.", "Yeah that\u2019s not how any of this works. I hope your ex tries to sue you for the damages since your son stole the car and most certainly isn\u2019t insured on it either. Wtf were you thinking?", "Nnnooo, you were trying to show your \"new son and husband\" that you loved them more than your own son by forcing him to give your new son his car because you just couldn't bare for new son not to have a car that's less expensive than your old son's.", "At the expense of your son's belongings. If you wanted this you should bought a car to this. You HAVE to pay whatever it costs for the car to be fixed.", "They can be equally loved by YOU, but there is no reason your ex needs to provide for your new husband's kid. That car was a gift to your son from his father, your step son had no right to be using it.", "Then go buy the step son a car!!! It\u2019s not your ex\u2019s responsibility he took care of his son.

My parents made me and my sibling share damn near everything. What one got, the other got too and when we were younger it was alright. \n\nNow we\u2019re adults. Guess what we have issues with: boundaries. I can\u2019t tell you how many time we were taken advantage of because we either couldn\u2019t say no due to being forced or felt terrible and selfish for doing so. \n\nThe car does not belong to your stepson. You forced your son to share something huge and you don\u2019t see it. \n\nYou forced him to share his autonomy, freedom and independence. \n\nYou didn\u2019t just restrict his use of his car for no valid reason, you took away one of his biggest milestones to becoming an adult.

Obviously your son's father loves his son more than his ex-wife's husband's son. Doesn't that not make sense to you?  \n\nYour stepson may mean absolutely nothing to your ex-husband (which is totally fine and acceptable, if that's the case).

You deserve the no contact that\u2019s coming. I hope babying your entitled husband and step son was worth loosing a relationship with your son.", "The gift to your son was from his father, not you or your husband.  Your ex does not love his son and your stepson equally.", "Nope, you showed your son that you care more for your new husband than him. You were currying favor at your son's expense. That is obvious by letting him only use a car that you have NO OWNERSHIP in on some weekdays so your step son could have it on the weekends. \n\nFix your son's car and your relationship with him. If not, you'll lose him.  He deserves better than what you did.", "Look, life's not fair. You could've used this as a learning opportunity, that life's not fair, income disparity, even within a family.  Then explain why, etc. But, you tried to go all authoritarian on him, and this is the result.   \n\n\nI'm not going to pile on because I think you get the point, that people are OUTRAGED.  \n\n\nBut, what are you going to do now to fix it?", "I hope your ex pursue legal action and your SS gets what he really deserves: a record for car theft YTA", "You don\u2019t show people they\u2019re loved equally by taking their things and giving them to somebody else.\n\nYTA", "Equally loved by the father of one of them?

You son is not stupid, he knows you care more about your husband and step kid. I hope he goes to live with grandparents or dad.", "Loved by whom? The giver doesn't love your stepson. So, this statement makes no sense.\n\nAnd you had no right to pretend that car was in any way your property to bestow rights on your stepson that the giver and recipient didn't agree to.\n\nLife is complicated with blended families.

Yeah, I hope your son and ex see this and proceed with the courts.", "WRONG ANSWER!!!! - Even more of a YTA. You fix it now - why does he have to have a damaged car because of your bad choices?

So I can see the exs point in this too.  Ex could be building a case to sue her ass too. So fixing the car could interfere with that too. \n\n\nBut we are also taking the work of a car thief and someone who thought it was moral and right to force her son into letting her entitled brat of a stepson use the car that her ex said that was the reason.
