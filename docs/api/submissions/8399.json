You cant ppssibly be an AH for asking for help from your own parents...\n\nYou are tired and overwhelmed. You did not only yourself, but your child a huge favour by stepping back for a moment and accepting outside help.

So when are you supposed to take time for yourself?\n\nYa giving him a heads up would have been nice, but if he has no good reason, like there were plans to take you guys out for dinner or some activity, then I think he over reacted. You needed a break, and you were responsible in who you left your child with. If he\u2019s so stressed with work maybe he needs time to decompress too. Why keep you both in a cycle of stress if your parents are willing to take their grand child for the evening. \n\nCommunication is always good on BOTH sides. So yes you could have mentioned it to him earlier, but you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel like you have to ask him. He could have told you he was disappointed because he wanted to spend time with his son, but if the expectation is that he\u2019s going to come home spend minimal time with son while you make dinner and clean, then you care for your child when not doing those chores, you have the right to make the decision to let your son stay over at his grandparents for the night.", "NTA\n\nUnless your parents are taking kiddo skydiving or on a trip out of town, I fail to see why asking hubs for \"permission\" to outsource kiddo for one night was necessary.\n\nHe's being unreasonable.", "NTA for a 3yo (was leaning YTA for a 3 month old) since you said your parents have watched him a lot, but next time for sure ask your husband.

The important thing is that you knew that your son would be in good hands with your parents, hence your decision to let them take your son for the night. \n\nSounds like your husband has deeper issues which you both need to sit down and talk about. I'd suggest coming up with an agreed course of action in the future for similar scenarios so that you are both mentally prepared and on the same page on childcare.", " NTA I was going to say it would be a good habit to let your SO know beforehand but based on your comments I personally wouldn\u2019t have bothered.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t do the bare minimum of childcare it isn\u2019t necessary. Better you hand over the kid for a night than burn out and fall asleep at the wrong time and the kid gets hurt. 3 year olds are tiny balls of energy. I get it.", "NTA and based on your comments I feel for you. I've got a 2 month old and a lot of stress to follow. However, giving him a heads up should have been standard.

If you feel like he isn\u2019t performing as a husband and father than leave until he can become better or divorce but don\u2019t take away ANYONES RIGHTS TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT THEIR CHILD then act confused when they\u2019re angry. You\u2019re setting a precedent that it only takes one parent to make a major decision(a child stating anywhere but home is a major decision) in your household and I can promise you it isn\u2019t going to end well.

Even if he's not the most natural dad in the world, you kinda cut his balls off by not asking. He deserves at least a text or a call ahead of time, at the VERY least. Also, it would have given him a chance to step up and do the parenting / dinner / bath / bedtime thing so you could go to sleep, put in earbuds and do a yoga class, grab a glass of wine with a friend, etc.... how else is he going to learn and get comfortable with this stuff if you just do it all the time? Also, don't know him, but most men want to be needed. This is new territory for him. Especially knowing what you do about his upbringing, I'd say you were being a bit obtuse. Also, not sure how a 3-month old is a bundle of destructive energy... they can't exactly get around to make messes or destroy a bunch of stuff. Your post makes me think that maybe your mental health needs some TLC, and your husband needs to be involved in that, too.", "My parents have taken him plenty of times before, this is the first time i didn't think to ask my husband.", "Yeah I was hoping for some kind of date night too. This isnt normal behaviour for him, i think hes just stressed from work and from the situation.

But I still think it\u2019s something I would have told my husband. \nI thought at first it was a trust issue, but it could been seen as a control issue now. \nHaving said all of that, he may have wanted the opportunity to support you and feels like he wasn\u2019t given the chance as your parents did this instead. \nEither way, what you did was not a big deal", "In that case I would say you are NTA.

I do a lot of the inside work while he does the yard work and the occasional cooking dinner, that comes to about an even split.", "Yeah", "She's a SAHM, of course she does more for the kids. There's no evidence that he doesn't care. He's just stuck in heteronormative gender roles. It's pretty shady that you'd assume he doesn't care when he clearly does", "Yeah i know, i just didnt really think in the moment. I just kind of blurted out a yes once my parents offered. I should of texted him or something first.", "No it doesn\u2019t, unless you live on a farm.", "Do you live in a regular suburban house? Because unless you live on a large property that needs a lot of regular maintenance you're the one trying to keep the house clean while looking after a human hurricane, trying to keep on top of cooking, dusting vacuuming, bathrooms, laundry etc, and being a SAHM is a fulltime job in itself before factoring in housework.", "OP specifically said in a comment that she doesn't get a break until the kid goes to bed. That means she's also taking care of her child a lot after her husband gets home from work. There's nothing shady, and I'm not assuming. If you're not that involved in your child's life other than doing a few things here or there, then that pretty much signals a lack of caring.", "But to be fair, if he literally called you an asshole over it, that's not ok, but hes not wrong for being unhappy about not knowing what's up.", "Not a farm but a pretty big yard with a lot of trees and greenery. So we get a lot of leaves, weeds, tree branches that need trimming, mowing and just making sure the yard looks nice and is safe for our son.

My husband never calls me names so i think it was just a moment of frustration for him, so im not going to make a big deal about it.", "Ah yes, doing chores (yard work is a chore) is a great reason to not take care of your child, minus a few things here and there.

Taking care of a baby is no easy task and it's great that the grandparents can assist.\n\nI can clearly remember when our daughter was that age. Going to work felt like I left a part of my heart behind every time I did and I counted the minutes till I could go home and hold my munchkin. So I completely understand that he was hurt and frustrated to find out he wouldn't see him. He was a bit the AH for how he handled it. A simple heads up would have been nice to manage expectations. \n\nYou're both probably sleep deprived so it's understandable that emotions get the better, just make time for each other as well and talk about your expectations.", "So was your husband ready to do 100% of the parenting when he came home, or was he expecting you to just power through your exhaustion?\n\nNTA", "ESH.

It was inconsiderate, not malicious, and you had a good reason too...you just needed to communicate it first.\n\nYour husband isn't an AH either though. You're stressed and burnt out, that impacts the whole house. He's probably stressed too. He may had been looking forward to getting home to his wife AND child, so he took it badly when all of a sudden your child wasn't there (and he has baggage from his own family so that surprise probably triggered some of those feelings). Young children can be draining bundles of non-stop chaos, but they're also adorable cuddly and sweet a lot too. Reverse the situation OP - if you were out of the house a lot, were stressed and tired, and looking forward to coming home to your family...how would you feel if your child just wasn't there? No notice...just a surprise?\n\nTalk it through, hopefully you'll both apologise, and move on.

He doesn't want to do it himself but wants a say in *how* she does it?

Basically you\u2019re on call 24/7 as a SAHP and have been while he gets to do \u201cbabysitting\u201d when he\u2019s back from work yet you still have to do housework, cooking, laundry, picking up after the kid, etc. \n\nWhen is the last time you had any meaningful break for yourself? or a vacation? cuz we see this in AITA all the time where parents think they\u2019re splitting equally but it turns out the SAHP has been operating without breaks for a while. and 3 is a terrible age too, my niece is the same & she\u2019s a terror. \n\nok also i didn\u2019t wanna necessarily throw this in here cuz it keeps being brought up in other AITA sometimes unnecessarily, but you were 20 when you had your kid so did you have any significant breaks for yourself to fully do what you wanted in your young adult years before you became a caretaker? You and your SO have a large gap, which isn\u2019t bad if you were both older but the gap between 20 & 27 is a lot of development and experience that you haven\u2019t had to take yet. Even like taking a vacation alone or something! \n\nI am leaning to ESH cuz you could have just texted him or something that you needed to send the kid off for a day but tbh you need to take care of yourself more since recovering from a burnout usually takes double the amount of time it takes for it to start and it really destroys your brain.

I recommend therapy to make sure y\u2019all are on the same page and he isn\u2019t bringing any toxic behaviors from his childhood onto your children as well.", "YTA. I mean this in the kindest way, as you were not doing wrong by your child, and had good intentions for both your child and your husband. One of the parts of parenting that is often difficult, and requires an ongoing, active effort, is actually the relationship between the parents. It\u2019s a tough one sometimes as you have this very fragile creature who you are madly in love with and want to do everything to protect and nurture the child; and you share this child with someone who is also madly in love and extremely attached to parenting the child, who sometimes has opposite ideas of how to protect and nurture the child. In order for the parenting relationship to work, a few things have got to exist, or develop. There has to be mutual respect, a willingness to talk, listen, and compromise and work together on parenting goals. There should be some agreed upon goals and boundaries. These should be respected and adhered to. There has to be a willingness to be wrong, and a willingness to apologize when you are wrong.\nYou can of course not do these things, and life will carry on. I believe though, if you can work out the parenting relationship as a supportive team effort, it will make life easier.\n****I do not wish to imply that everyone should have a supportive team relationship, only that it can make life easier if it works. Mad respect to the parents who need to and do hold their own in order to maintain their own positive parenting values.\nEveryone\u2019s got to work out and maintain their own set of parenting rules, subject to active discussion and ongoing adjustments. Some rules are pretty standard for everyone. Giving over care of your child should always be a mutual decision. \nThe circumstances: 1) an overnight visit, and 2) your child is very young, mean that your husband was absolutely justified in being upset. The secondary factors: good intentions, the fact that it\u2019s your mom, the fact that he came from a rough home, the fact that he is loathe to trust, do not cancel the primary factor, which is that you gave up care of your three year old child, for what is presumably his first sleepover, without permission from your husband.\nThese is honestly a happy problem to have. You are looking to take a much needed break, which is great, you are responding to stress in a healthy and proactive way. Your husband, if you can put aside your frustration with him at the moment, is showing strong and healthy attachment to your child. As parents, having a strong and healthy attachment to your child is key to their wellbeing. Be great full that he is attached, and concerned, please, I beg of you to quit justifying yourself, listen to him, apologize, and promise to work with him as a parent.\nI am not saying that you should be guided by his trauma, just that you two have got to work out, working things out as parents here. You did not do your part here, in terms of crossing a line (not giving up custody of your child without mutual agreement), and you did not seek to work with him when making a significant parenting decision. Whether or not his parenting concerns or choices are directed by his trauma, and the effects, should be an ongoing discussion. The only possible way to maintain such a discussion, is with a mix of kindness, care and boundaries. Dismissing any possible concern of his as being a result of trauma, misses the mark entirely.\nJust talk it out, and apologize. You both have good things going on as parents. Don\u2019t make this an oppositional situation by being disrespectful of him as a parent.", "OP next time you need a break, and as an old person I'm suggesting every 6 months or so, offer your husband a choice he can look after toddler by himself while you check in to a nice hotel for the weekend or your  folks can look after him and the two of you can have a weekend of grown up time.", "NTA though you should have had a discussion. Please contact your I terminated or Family Medicine Primary care doctor to discuss what you are feeling. 3 month old babies are not destructive as they can barely hold anything at that age.", "I mean no but kinda yes.

But I'm not asking \"hey do you mind if our son goes to my parents tonight?\" that shouldn't really have to be a discussion one needs to wait to hear back about.", "You're NTA, but if it were me I would have just liked a heads up first. My wife never needs to ask permission to get a break if she can, but I could see wanting to know what's going on ahead of time.

It's so important for you to have a chance to rest and recharge.  \n\nI was in a situation where my husband would guilt trip me about not being able to see the kids much because he was always working so much overtime. But all it would turn into was me watching the kids 24/7 with no breaks! He eventually realized that he was incapable of taking care of them without help and accepts that having someone else share the burden is very much needed.\n\nIf your parents are capable and caring, there is no reason why you can't have them help you when you need it. If you are the primary caregiver to your infant, you should be able to make these decisions as it is in your and your child's best interest. \n\nI do think you should have let him know before hand that it was happening so that he wouldn't have been blindsided. At the end of the day, you have to make sure you're okay before you can take care of others.
