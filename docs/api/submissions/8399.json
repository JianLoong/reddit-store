How are you splitting parental responsibilities at home?\n\nIf it's purely all up to you and he is the type of guy who 'babysits' his kids or can't handle looking after them to give you a break then I'd sat you aren't the asshole here.\n\nHow did you get so burned out to begin with? Parenting is so hard but your partner should be sharing the load so you don't always feel like your drowning", "NTA- yeah communication is important but this wasn't a life altering decision.  Also... how much does he help n when he's at home?", "Wanna say ESH. Parenting is a united front. I get you\u2019re exhausted but you should have at least said something to your husband.\n\nThat being said I feel like he overreacted a bit. Work on communication next time.", "Eh, ESH at least a little.  You shouldn't have sent your kid off for the night without talking to your husband first.  Making sure you're both on board with things is just a good precedent to set before the kid hits \"if Mom says no, I'll ask Dad\" age.  That said, he should have some sympathy for your energy levels.\n\nYou're both a bit wrong, but in a way that's normal for parents of a toddler.  Talk it out, set some ground rules so you're both on the same page next time.", "Not an asshole but should give him the heads up", "NTA. Why do you need to ask your husband? Talk to him, discuss it with him\u2026 sure. But \u201cAsk\u201d him? Nah.   \n\n\nYou are an adult making adult choices. Yes he has parental rights and equal right to decision making but this isn\u2019t a major decision, it\u2019s a pretty low key normal things for grand parents to look after young children a night here and there.", "NTA but your husband is.\n\nSure, there should have been a text or something, but his reaction was over the top and you should be able to take a break.", "Slight YTA here. You probably should have at least sent him a text with what you were planning to do before the kids left. Apologize and let him know you'll notify him before finalizing any plans for the kids in the future.", "I don\u2019t want to call you the asshole, because I don\u2019t think you had any intention to be one. That being said you can\u2019t do that with out talking to your husband, it\u2019s his kid too and decisions like that need to be made together. I know if my wife sent my daughter off for the night with out talking to me about it I would be pretty upset about it.", "YTA - mildly. I think he would have just appreciated being in the loop. He's only 3 months. He just wants to know where his kid is.", "YTA.  This is a \"sympathetic asshole\" kind of situation - it's understandable that you did this because you felt overwhelmed, but you really did need to ask your husband first.", "If your spouse was so taken aback by the goodwill of your parents recognizing that you needed a break, he should have said something to your parents, not you. \n\nClearly you need to discuss your burnout with your spouse, perhaps he's not as clued in to how much of an energy vampire little ones can be. \n\nIf anything, he should have at least tried to be happy to have a date night with you, without any potential interruptions. \n\nEither way, having to ask is BS, maybe sending a text or calling and letting him know might have been a better decision, but burnout can make one feel extremely exhausted and brain foggy.\n\nCommunication could be better and it's not like you were GIVING your child away indefinitely. All parents deserve a break, but no one deserves being called an asshole for wanting a moment.", "If you know he has trust issues with parental units and didn't run it by him first...yeah YTA.", "NTA - sure, you could have mentioned it, but his reaction is absurd. He needs to seek counseling for that.", "NTA. I think this is an extremely pointless hill for him to die on... yes you could have mentioned it, but I really dont think it warranted such a negatulive reaction from him? He could have just said something like \"Oh ok, maybe next time just give me a call before hand so we can discuss it\". You cant ppssibly be an AH for asking for help from your own parents...\n\nYou are tired and overwhelmed. You did not only yourself, but your child a huge favour by stepping back for a moment and accepting outside help. We all need a little me time occasionally, and if he isnt recognising and respecting that then he is being a little bit of an AH himself. Be kind to yourself mama \ud83d\udc95", "NTA - But, you should have definitely given him a heads up.", "INFO - is he traumatized from his parents which is why events like this trigger him? Do you know about this? If you do know that such separation from his children make him feel uneasy and uncertain about who they are left with, you should have let him know first. I understand you are burnt out and many mothers deserve to have this heavy weight of a responsibility lifted off their shoulders time to time, but I believe had you communicated that with him, you could have come up with a great plan to tackle this, one that is friendly to both your feelings and schedule.", "NTA \n\nYou needed a break. Was your husband going to take over everything and give you a break? If not, then he is TA!", "Nta for wanting that or giving him away.. Which is a smart move btw to do early.\n\nBut maybe next time communicte this better?", "YTA that's something you clear with a spouse.", "Soft YTA - I have a 3yr old and a 1yr old and I\u2019m a SAHM so I totally get needing a break and I feel for you there. \n\nIn saying that, I would never in a million years send our kids to my parents house without first checking with my husband, they\u2019re his kids as well, he has a say in where they go. \n\nA simple text to your husband might have fixed this whole problem.", "NAH. They're your parents and you trust them and that's great! But the father of the child definitely deserved to be notified.\n\nChalk this one up to poor communication of expectations.

You say he\u2019s spent the night at your parents many times. So he knows your son is safe. You also take on most of the household and parental responsibility. So when are you supposed to take time for yourself?\n\nYa giving him a heads up would have been nice, but if he has no good reason, like there were plans to take you guys out for dinner or some activity, then I think he over reacted. You needed a break, and you were responsible in who you left your child with. If he\u2019s so stressed with work maybe he needs time to decompress too. Why keep you both in a cycle of stress if your parents are willing to take their grand child for the evening. \n\nCommunication is always good on BOTH sides. So yes you could have mentioned it to him earlier, but you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel like you have to ask him. He could have told you he was disappointed because he wanted to spend time with his son, but if the expectation is that he\u2019s going to come home spend minimal time with son while you make dinner and clean, then you care for your child when not doing those chores, you have the right to make the decision to let your son stay over at his grandparents for the night.", "NTA\n\nUnless your parents are taking kiddo skydiving or on a trip out of town, I fail to see why asking hubs for \"permission\" to outsource kiddo for one night was necessary.\n\nHe's being unreasonable.", "NTA for a 3yo (was leaning YTA for a 3 month old) since you said your parents have watched him a lot, but next time for sure ask your husband. I would have been pissed if my husband took the kids to my own parents\u2019 place overnight without checking with me, and I trust my parents beyond measure with the kids.", "NTA. Burout is real. The important thing is that you knew that your son would be in good hands with your parents, hence your decision to let them take your son for the night. \n\nSounds like your husband has deeper issues which you both need to sit down and talk about. I'd suggest coming up with an agreed course of action in the future for similar scenarios so that you are both mentally prepared and on the same page on childcare.", " NTA I was going to say it would be a good habit to let your SO know beforehand but based on your comments I personally wouldn\u2019t have bothered.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t do the bare minimum of childcare it isn\u2019t necessary. Better you hand over the kid for a night than burn out and fall asleep at the wrong time and the kid gets hurt. 3 year olds are tiny balls of energy. I get it.", "NTA and based on your comments I feel for you. I've got a 2 month old and a lot of stress to follow. However, giving him a heads up should have been standard. You're in a relationship no matter how you split work/childcare/ household management and communication is vital.", "YTA YTA YTA. No one wants to come home to their child not being there without a discussion beforehand. If your husband took your child and dropped him off and didn\u2019t tell you until later you\u2019d flip and call him the worst husband and father in the world and Reddit would agree(I DONT CARE WHO THE CHILD WAS DROPPED OFF TO OR HOW OFTEN THEY BEEN THERE). If you feel like he isn\u2019t performing as a husband and father than leave until he can become better or divorce but don\u2019t take away ANYONES RIGHTS TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT THEIR CHILD then act confused when they\u2019re angry. You\u2019re setting a precedent that it only takes one parent to make a major decision(a child stating anywhere but home is a major decision) in your household and I can promise you it isn\u2019t going to end well. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH NEEDING A BREAK AND HAVING SOMEONE STEP IN TO ASSIST but there\u2019s a way to do it without disregarding the other parent.", "NTA. Sounds like in the future it will be a good idea to communicate that with him but I definitely feel like he over reacted.", "I think a gentle YTA. You should have communicated with your partner about your child staying elsewhere in this specific situation. You are in a partnership and he deserves your forethought.", "If you knew your husband had issues with your parents watching the children, and it sounds to me like you did, then YTA.\n\nA phone call to let him know and voice his objections so you could discuss it doesn't sound like much to ask.", "YTA. Even if he's not the most natural dad in the world, you kinda cut his balls off by not asking. He deserves at least a text or a call ahead of time, at the VERY least. Also, it would have given him a chance to step up and do the parenting / dinner / bath / bedtime thing so you could go to sleep, put in earbuds and do a yoga class, grab a glass of wine with a friend, etc.... how else is he going to learn and get comfortable with this stuff if you just do it all the time? Also, don't know him, but most men want to be needed. This is new territory for him. Especially knowing what you do about his upbringing, I'd say you were being a bit obtuse. Also, not sure how a 3-month old is a bundle of destructive energy... they can't exactly get around to make messes or destroy a bunch of stuff. Your post makes me think that maybe your mental health needs some TLC, and your husband needs to be involved in that, too.", "My parents have taken him plenty of times before, this is the first time i didn't think to ask my husband.", "Yeah I was hoping for some kind of date night too. This isnt normal behaviour for him, i think hes just stressed from work and from the situation. My husband and me are normally good at communication but I just saw an opportunity to have a break and didnt think to ask my husband.", "Exactly! I really sont get why ppl get so dang mad over things stuff like this. Fair enough if she sent him off with a non-relative, but her own parents? Yikes.", "My husband will occasionally help with bed time but im the one who does most of the parental responsibilities. I dont get much time to myself till our son is in bed.", "Except her husband doesn\u2019t parent. Per her comments, he \u201coccasionally helps with bedtime\u201d but leaves her to do all of the parenting duties, even though she\u2019s burned out. \n\nIf he\u2019s not going to be an equal parent, he doesn\u2019t get equal say. NTA", "Thats fair. Probably best to discuss this so it doesn't happen again.", "OP said she was frazzled and her husband doesn't do much for parenting beyond the occasional bedtime. Her parents offered to give her a break.", "No her husband is not the asshole for wanting to have a say in what happens to his son.", "3 years old sorry.", "Why would asking be BS? That\u2019s his child too", "Yeah brain fog was kind of what happened. My parents offered and i said yes without thinking to much, i was just relieved that i could have a break.", "Now you have said your son has stayed with your parents many times, I am swaying to NTA. But I still think it\u2019s something I would have told my husband. \nI thought at first it was a trust issue, but it could been seen as a control issue now. \nHaving said all of that, he may have wanted the opportunity to support you and feels like he wasn\u2019t given the chance as your parents did this instead. \nEither way, what you did was not a big deal", "In that case I would say you are NTA. It seems like you were having a really bad time and just needed an out. Obviously it would have been better to ask him to take the kid for the night first, but if he was out and unavailable, was there any chance he would have said no?", "So the occasional bedtime is all he does? He doesn't pick up the parenting ball when you need a break? Does he do anything around the house? If he's not doing anything in his role as a father by choice then he can't complain about not being included in parenting decision.", "Are you a SAHM?", "It was a night at his grandparents house... fair enough a medical decision or maybe a school field trip... but a night at the grandparents house? Come on... there are much worse hills to die on. This is just pointless misery.", "OP has said that her husband rarely takes care of their kid. Why does he care now all of a sudden?", "Even then. I doubt he was upset you wanted a break or that he was with your parents, just wants to be in the loop.", "I totally get it... I used to offer to babysit for two single mom friends, both had only one child each, a 15 month old son and a 7 year old daughter, they were ALWAYS ALWAYS happy to have a minute to themselves, sometimes they went out, on other occasions, they just went to bed for a few hours to get some uninterrupted sleep. \n\nThe struggle is real and support is not always available, so when it's offered it's not an easy gift to refuse. It is okay to need a break...", "Yeah that info swings things by a lot. It's really pertinent information that should be in an edit.", "No, i dont think he would of said no. Every other time my parents have offered his said yes except the time when my husband wanted to take our son fishing.", "He will play with him, keep him occupied and teach him things but most of the childcare falls to me. As for chores my husband is pretty good at splitting them. I do a lot of the inside work while he does the yard work and the occasional cooking dinner, that comes to about an even split.", "Yeah", "She's a SAHM, of course she does more for the kids. There's no evidence that he doesn't care. He's just stuck in heteronormative gender roles. It's pretty shady that you'd assume he doesn't care when he clearly does", "Yeah i know, i just didnt really think in the moment. I just kind of blurted out a yes once my parents offered. I should of texted him or something first.", "No it doesn\u2019t, unless you live on a farm.", "Do you live in a regular suburban house? Because unless you live on a large property that needs a lot of regular maintenance you're the one trying to keep the house clean while looking after a human hurricane, trying to keep on top of cooking, dusting vacuuming, bathrooms, laundry etc, and being a SAHM is a fulltime job in itself before factoring in housework.", "OP specifically said in a comment that she doesn't get a break until the kid goes to bed. That means she's also taking care of her child a lot after her husband gets home from work. There's nothing shady, and I'm not assuming. If you're not that involved in your child's life other than doing a few things here or there, then that pretty much signals a lack of caring.", "But to be fair, if he literally called you an asshole over it, that's not ok, but hes not wrong for being unhappy about not knowing what's up.", "Not a farm but a pretty big yard with a lot of trees and greenery. So we get a lot of leaves, weeds, tree branches that need trimming, mowing and just making sure the yard looks nice and is safe for our son. My husband is a landscaper/gardener so he does a lot with our front and back yards.", "She also said that he pulls his weight around the house in terms of chores and yard work on top of being the sole provider.", "I understand his frustration, thats why i feel terrible not asking him. My husband never calls me names so i think it was just a moment of frustration for him, so im not going to make a big deal about it.", "Ah yes, doing chores (yard work is a chore) is a great reason to not take care of your child, minus a few things here and there. Totally equal...\n\nBeing a SAHM is providing for the family. They would have to pay a ton of daycare costs if she worked and it might actually end up being more expensive for them, depending on the job she got.", "She never said that either. She admits he spends quality time with their children. She is just feeling burnt out an rightfully was hoping for some one on one time with her husband. But despite all that everyone is redditing it up and has decided he doesnt do shit. Which she has disputed herself."]}
