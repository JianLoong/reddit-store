Tell her you're going to save up to go to her next one. Lol. Way to stick up for your wife.", "NTA -- and having a wedding on 12/24 is kinda like saying out of area people do not come", "\"My mindset is, if you don\u2019t care about my marriage or daughter, why I should i put my family in a bad financial position just to show face.\"\n\nNTA.

Again.\"  And then run like you stole something!", "NTA\n\nI guarantee your mom knew/was told that having a wedding the day before Christmas would make it more expensive for everyone!", "NTA.  If she wanted her kids to show up knowing how far away they live and how expensive everything gets around the holidays, she would not have booked her wedding for December 24th", "NTA. You can't invite people to a wedding on Christmas and expect them to show up. Add to that the extremely short notice.", "My brother reached out and told me the wedding was set back in February, why couldn\u2019t she tell me then. Sucks but hey life goes on, glad I got this off my chest thanks guys!", "NTA\n\n\nFunny she chose the date she did. Christmas eve, high travel costs, and grandchildren. Doesn't tell you till a couple months out so it's difficult for someone who lives far away to attend. It's almost like she did it purposely knowing her son's probably wouldn't make it.  Right off the bat she is the victim, your wife is the bad guy, and you changed.\n\n\nIt's all about her, all the time.", "NTA- Not only does she disrespect your wife but she is not even really concerned about how your child is doing. Why does she have a problem with you that cannot go but not with your brothers as well? You handled it great because you thought about what effect it will have on your family financially.", "NTA\n\nIf it's to much for you financially and how she treats your wife then don't go.  Your mother will be just fine.", "NTA You've gone more than halfway in an effort to include her in your family yet your mother shows zero interest unless, like putting pics on facebook, it reflects on her. You don't need to attend her wedding nor send her photos of your family for her to look like she's actually a loving person when it's a lie. Stay home and enjoy your family.", "NTA. Your responsibilities are to your own family after marriage, not to your mother. If money is too tight to make the trip, that\u2019s it period. Yeah, you might have \u201cchanged\u201d after marriage into a supportive husband and father aka no longer fully available to emotionally support her. From the 3 weddings you indicated I\u2019m assuming she has major issues with men. Those type of women rely heavily on their sons in a weird Freudian way. Don\u2019t feel bad OP, she\u2019s got a new husband now. \n\nAlso, stop letting her post your kid on social media. It\u2019s weird for a multitude of reasons but chiefly: you don\u2019t know what kind of people or predators have access to those photos.", "NTA you're completely correct. Your mother needs to put in more effort and you will reciprocate, you've tried to involve her more but she shuts you down repeatedly. Also, who gives out wedding invites with 2 weeks notice the day before Christmas?!?! Lol", "NTA. You already do more than you should. She sounds like she uses guilt and blame as a tool quite often.", "You are a good husband and a good dad OP.\n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
