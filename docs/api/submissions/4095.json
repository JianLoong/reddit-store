However, expecting people ( you) to show up on Christmas Eve, for a wedding, 1,000 miles away, is a bit much, especially since you and your wife have kids. Celebrating Christmas from a hotel room, away from home, sucks, especially with three little kids. They deserve to be home in bed Christmas Eve, waiting for Santa.", "NTA\n\nThe date is totally unreasonable.\n\nAlso I think a third wedding is a bit ridiculous.\n\nFirst wedding is a big one.\n\nSecond wedding. You\u2019ve already blown a lot of money once. Do a cheap one in someone\u2019s backyard.\n\nThird wedding. Go to the county courthouse and just go to a Justice off the peace and go to Waffle House afterwards.", "NTA - You are married with a child and they should be your primary responsibility. Your mother and her feelings about her endless weddings is not your problem. If your mom cannot be respectful to your wife, then there's no reason why you should spend time with your mother at all.", "Ask your wife to stop sending pictures and leave your mom for you to handle. Thank her for all the effort she\u2019s put into being kind to your mother but at this time, given your mother\u2019s behavior, you will be handling her (mom) from here on our. \nSend a message to your mother that she is never to speak poorly about your wife again. Wife has been the one to make sure mother gets pictures & updates but from here on out you will be handling that.", "Even people close by might not be able to come on Christmas Eve. Half my family is German. We used to do Christmas Eve presents and dinner with them, and probably wouldn't have missed it for a wedding.", "Honestly, who the hell is going to put their Christmas on hold to go to a wedding? Seems like having it on Christmas Eve guarantees the only people who will attend are people who always spend Christmas together anyway.\n\nBut that aside, even if OP, wife and mother   got along beautifully, OP really can't afford to attend. That's just a simple fact. If the mother really wanted OP to be at the wedding, she would have arranged it so OP and family could be there without spending any more money than they normally due to visit her.", "Fourth, if you assume there was one with OPs dad before they were born. \n\nLooking at some of the comments, the wedding date has been set since February and Mom is only telling them now\u2026 smells fishy as a John West warehouse.", "Tell her that she\u2019s paying for your hotel and your airfare right? Or at least half of she wants you there so desperately", "A Christmas Eve wedding is already ridiculous.  A *third wedding* on Christmas Eve*?  LOL.  \n\nThat's just next-level, much less making drama about people not being able to make it.", "NTA\n\nTell her you'll try to make it to the next one.", "We are not talking about abuse parents.", "NTA, you can't financially justify it. Tell her you'll attend the next one. xD", ">My mother didn\u2019t mention anything about a wedding, until after we left her house and went back to our hotel. We received an evite over text.\n\nI need nothing more than this. If having you at her wedding was actually important to her, she'd have at least discussed it with you.\n\nNTA.  Evites and text invites are for casual, friend-level stuff. I don't require a $20 fancy invitation in the mail (in fact, as a traveler, I much prefer digital), but if it's a big event, it had better be accompanied by an actual conversation."]}
