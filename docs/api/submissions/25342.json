{"id": 25342, "submission_id": "15z6aak", "title": "AITA for walking out of church?", "selftext": "I (23f) recently moved downtown and in the process of trying to find a new church as my old church would have been a 40-minute commute. I did some research on some churches that where near me and decided to check one out. This pervious Sunday I attended the church. The people were very welcoming and polite. I filled out a guest card before heading into the sanctuary, important for later.\n\nWe got through worship and the sermon started. The pastor started preaching how we have to give money to the church so God could answer our prayers and that if we didn\u2019t give money to the church God wouldn\u2019t answer our prayers and our lives wouldn\u2019t be fulfilling. I walked out during this as I felt uncomfortable and I didn\u2019t think this was biblical.  To be clear, they don\u2019t state believing this on their website.\n\nOn Tuesday a representative of the church reached out to me, they got my number from the guest card. She stated that it was rude of me walking out during the sermon. This particular church is very popular but the location I attended was small so you could see me walk out. I just walked out quietly and did not disturb the sermon but now I am wondering if I should have just sat through it and just not attend again.\n\nPart of me feels like I did that right thing but another part of me wonders if I should have better manners. Also please excuse any grammar mistakes as I am not a good writer.\n\nEdit to clarify that this is a Christian Church\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: I've been reading through the comments and I feel so much better for walking out. I was always taught to be respectful and polite to those around me. I also did want to clarify that the representative of this \"church\" texted me. She did not call so I just blocked her number and I will just move on from this and take it as a lesson.

I personally would leave a big long reply about how they promoted monetary contributions as a direct reasoning for God's intervening, and that's incredibly un-Christian (assuming this is a Christian church).

And there were constantly exercise programs and other awesome community focused events there.
