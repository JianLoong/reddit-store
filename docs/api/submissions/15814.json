What a horrible and insensitive thing to say. He regrets saying it? Great, he can tell it to your face and apologize. Jesus.", "NTA.\n\nIt's up to you whether you forgive someone, not anyone else. Your mother wants to \"keep the peace\", in other words enable his poor behaviour.", "NTA - your dad sounds like a piece of work.\n\nI saw something on here the other day that forgiveness is not necessarily for the person who is in the wrong.  It's a way of letting go of the negative emotions you have inside.  I'm not saying you should do this now, but at some point maybe consider it.  And let me also clarify that **forgiving him does not mean extending trust or repairing the relationship**.  It means letting go of the anger and emotions that are hurting you so that you can move forward in a healthy way, and no longer let his awful past actions impact your life.\n\nI hope that you consider therapy after your attack, especially since it was by someone that you considered a friend.  Best wishes to you during your recovery. \ud83d\udc97", "NTA. Your dad sounds like his mouth runs faster than this brain, something he needs to work on.

If not, you may want to look into it to deal with it and also deal with your father's treatment of you. Forgiveness is your choice and you don't owe it to anyone. It sounds like you may not get the comforting words or an apology from your Dad and I am suspicious that your Mom is and has been running interference on his behalf - did he really feel bad about what he said, or is that Mom trying to smooth things over? Regardless, you need to find a way to not let your father's lack of parenting skills eat away at you. It's not you, it's him and it's terrible the way he treats you. I'm very sorry. Find a therapist and take care of yourself. NTA.", "NTA, not even remotely.\n\nI hope you're doing okay.

It's sounds like your dad has no filter or emergency stop button between his brain and mouth. Forgiveness follows remorse, and although he apparently feels remorse, if he doesn't express his regrets then his guilt means fuck all. \n\nRegarding the creature that assaulted you, in the end, it is up to you. Nobody should make that decision for you. Personally, I'd show no mercy. His next 20 years deserve to be ruined. It may not be his first time, and getting away with something like that encourages repeat behavior.", "NTA. You can choose to forgive someone without an apology but you can\u2019t really mend a relationship without one. Your dad owes you an apology directly. \n\nIt seems like he has some maturing to do, because if he truly regrets what he said, he can\u2019t just go to your mom in private and expect that to filter down to you. It seems like he\u2019s trying to protect his ego by not admitting fault but also expects the situation to boil over. He needs to grow up a bit and realize that maintaining relationships involves swallowing your pride when you\u2019re in the wrong and admitting that you were wrong directly to the person you hurt, and apologizing directly.\n\nHis past hurtful outburst proves he hasn\u2019t fully be acting like an adult.", "Thanks.
