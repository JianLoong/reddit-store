It sounds like you may not get the comforting words or an apology from your Dad and I am suspicious that your Mom is and has been running interference on his behalf - did he really feel bad about what he said, or is that Mom trying to smooth things over?

Nobody should make that decision for you. Personally, I'd show no mercy. His next 20 years deserve to be ruined.

You can choose to forgive someone without an apology but you can\u2019t really mend a relationship without one. Your dad owes you an apology directly. \n\nIt seems like he has some maturing to do, because if he truly regrets what he said, he can\u2019t just go to your mom in private and expect that to filter down to you. It seems like he\u2019s trying to protect his ego by not admitting fault but also expects the situation to boil over. He needs to grow up a bit and realize that maintaining relationships involves swallowing your pride when you\u2019re in the wrong and admitting that you were wrong directly to the person you hurt, and apologizing directly.\n\nHis past hurtful outburst proves he hasn\u2019t fully be acting like an adult.", "Thanks.

Emotional abuse is so 1950. Your parents are probably actually too young to have been actual boomers, however.", "YBTA now this is probably a controversial take but please know that I truly wish you both the best and for a repaired relationship and prosperous future as a family. It seems to me like you have been having a build up of these feelings all your life from the several other mentions in the post, when it comes to becoming an adult yourself the realization your parents are just normal people is a tough thing to come to terms with. I am not denying that having to go through title 9 was traumatic and it seems to me that you needed support from your father you didn\u2019t receive in that moment. (His lack of emotional maturity/delicacy) going further into your post you mention you\u2019re a progressive thinker and he is more traditional. This is something that happens with every interaction in daily life as people we are nuanced and inherently have different views in life but to be successful in navigating relationships it can\u2019t be a combative approach. (There has to be compromises) I mention compromise as well because you go on to talk about his mentions on $ in regards to your siblings sports. I can see how his poor communication of I spend this much money for you to play is really trying to say sports teach you great life skills, perseverance, teamwork, hard work, and to have fun while doing the aforementioned life skills. Your father just may not know how to communicate that and is stretched thin with the real world implications of having that many kids. You seem like you have a good heart and are looking out for your siblings and trying to ensure they\u2019re emotionally stable however it also seems to me there is some grace you can offer your father in some of these scenarios as well. I hope that I\u2019ve communicated fluently enough for op to realize that there is ground on both sides that needs to be mended and I hope the best for the both of you. I will leave with there is always a time and a place for certain conversations and a deep contemplation and deep breaths/ level headed communication goes a long way with working towards compromise.

Your former friend dug his own grave, not you.\n\nYour mom\u2019s argument that \u201cthey won\u2019t be around forever\u201d is an interesting choice given that neither will you.
