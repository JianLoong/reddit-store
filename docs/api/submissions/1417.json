He was upset and wanted to go to the hospital immediately.

Let me know, because honestly I\u2019m beyond frustrated.\n\nShe also says that I act like only I should be involved in what happens in his life and that it\u2019s messed up and that my reasoning that I explained to her is me trying to justify myself.\nAlso my fianc\u00e9 has an immune disorder that can cause complications like paralysis, fatigue, etc - he is feeling a little better right now, but didn\u2019t hydrate and eat properly today which is what caused it. Plus his medicine switched recently which made it worse.", "created_utc": 1667607350, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymewph/aita_for_taking_my_almost_husbandpartner_of_8/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Forget her.", "Dear lord NTA\n\nAs for your soon-to-be MIL, she sounds like a complete nightmare. The fact that she dismissed heartbeat irregularities indicates that she's a narcissistic jerk. Which is multiplied by the fact that she had the audacity to yell at you for *not bringing her to the hospital with you*. That's the type of bald-face hypocrisy you expect people to detect for themselves, to the point of not even thinking to point it out yourself. \n\nOne last important point: **Never dismiss symptoms of chest issues, and never delay getting someone with these symptoms to an ER**. Time is a critical factor. You did well to get your fianc\u00e9 to the hospital straightaway.", "NTA. He wanted to go to the hospital. His comfort was your concern. This wasn't about his mother, who just belittled his concern anyway initially.", "NTA you were 100% reasonable.

You were appropriately dealing with a situation that required you to immediately drive and focus on calming your partner.

Your husband had no way of knowing what exactly was wrong, and when it comes to anything related to possible heart problems you certainly don't waste any of those essential minutes getting to the hospital as quickly as possible. And what really irks me, is it sounds like all she really cared about was making a fuss, she showed no genuine concern with whether or not her son was okay.", ">she said \u2018bring it back when y\u2019all done because ain\u2019t nothing wrong with him.\u2019\n\nShe didn't care one way or the other.

You were being more than accommodating.", "NTA. Your partner is not a child anymore, but his mother doesn\u2019t seem to understand or accept that. Adults don\u2019t actually involve their parents in every waking moment of their day.
