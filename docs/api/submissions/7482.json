I practically live there anyway so she very quickly agreed that I can stay until I turn 18.\n\nWhile packing my stuff I started participating in pranks again to keep my brother and parents happy so they wouldn't be suspicious. I kept telling my brother about an \"epic prank\" I was planning, and a few clips of me talking about it where in videos and fans got really hyped for it.\n\nThe \"prank\" was me taking the last of the stuff that was still in my room and using a lot of printer paper and tape to write notes all over my walls, bed, desk, everywhere that said things along the lines of \"have fun without me\" \"I'm not coming back\" \"I hate your pranks\" and other comments. I doubt he'll post the video but I like to imagine he turned purple seeing it all.\n\nI'm currently at my best friends house and we are working things out legally so that I can stay without my parents claiming I was kidnapped or anything. I'm also considered getting a restraining order against my brother, and am looking for a new job, hopefully with better pay so he can't try to see me while I'm at work.\n\nI still won't be making any social media or exposing my brother, he can loose his fans on his own without my help and I can stay anonymous and out of the public eye.\n\nThank you everyone who gave me advice I really appreciate it", "created_utc": 1673885370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dieuh/update_aita_for_blasting_disney_music/", "score": 2584, "replies": ["Congrats.

That could be very bad if her parents call the police, as her friends parents have no right to take her from her parents.\n\nAlso, her brothers annoying videos lifted the entire family out of poverty, and are fully supporting their parents. Yeah it sucks but it\u2019s also probably a lot better than struggling for survival and her parents having to work until they die because retirement is just not an option for people in poverty. Finding a solution that everyone can manage in a healthy way is a LOT better than just blowing that all up and going back to a terrible life.\n\nOP has a place to stay until 18, at which point she is going to have to find whatever low wage job will hire someone fresh out of high school so she can start paying rent, which in most cases will lead to a life of struggle which could potentially be avoided.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely insane to just steer OP to run away without properly thinking through all the options and potential consequences of it.", "Wow, just wow.
