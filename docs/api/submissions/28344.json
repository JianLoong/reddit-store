He asked me out when we first met and I said no. He's been in a few relationships over the years and had a long-term girlfriend for four years.\n\nTom broke up with his long-term gf in March and asked me out quite a few times afterwards. This caused tension within our friendship, but the last time we spoke about it, he seemed to understand that I wasn't interested, and a relationship with me was never going to be on the table. \n\nHis family has been putting pressure on him settling down and getting married, especially since his brother got engaged. He asked me if I could be his plus one to his big brother's wedding so he wouldn't go alone, and I (reluctantly) said yes. \n\nTom told his brother about me, and his brother said he'd like to meet me before the wedding \"in case it's awkward\" and he doesn't want anyone ruining his wedding. I thought this was a tad strange because I'm only a plus one. I'm not part of the wedding party. But I said sure, arrange something if you want to.\n\nTom's brother has since told his mother and father about me. Now his mother wants to meet me before the wedding too, as Tom said: \"just to make sure you'll fit in with everyone\". I feel like I'm being screened and I'm finding it kind of offensive. \n\nI'm starting to think maybe Tom has implied I'm more than a friend to his family. It's making me uncomfortable.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I pulled out of the wedding?

Being friends is just a play, even if they value the friendship, they hope deep down you'll eventually change your mind. \n\nI know you care for him but the kindest thing to do would be to distance yourself from him. I wouldn't go to this wedding AT ALL - there is so many chances for it to get even more messy.", "As a dude who\u2019s experienced the friend/more than friend relationship dynamic and known of many other dudes who have.\n\nTrust me when I say he\u2019s not your friend, he wants to have you sexually and/or romantically and he\u2019s settling for being your friend. If he hasn\u2019t stoped asking in over 10 years despite fully being aware of your position than it is never going to change. \n\nFriends don\u2019t beg you to go out with them despite knowing it makes you uncomfortable and that your answer is no. \n\nThat is a major red flag.", "Just to add something here - I am thinking you need to remove yourself from him entirely, not just the wedding. I don't think you should be mean to him or anything, but just stop talking to him or seeing him or hanging out or whatever you have been doing as friends. Have a conversation or email/text to let him know or ghost him if you'd prefer\n\nI say this as a guy that (when I was younger) had a crush on a girl that was in the same friend circles as me. We were close, but she never had any romantic feeling for me - just considered me a friend. She would hang out and all that sort of stuff but had refused my date requests (I think there were 2 - maybe just 1, but not many at all) but had no trouble gong out as friends and stuff (lets meet at the bar or I wanted to see this movie, come with me, etc.).\n\nThe problem for me was that my crush did not go away. I did date others but when those ended, I still had a crush on her and she was always hanging around. I finally had to disengage from the friend group and stop doing stuff with them to get away from her and let myself get over her and not keep getting my hopes up that \"this time will be different\". \n\nSo, despite your blunt talk and stuff, he may still have a crush on you and you hanging around my keep him thinking \"maybe if I do this\" or whatever. If this is a crush like I'm thinking, you will hurt him by cutting things off and your friendship will be negatively impacted and most likely ended - but he will be better off for it and it sounds like you want him to be better off, so I think you need to take that bullet. I wish my friend had done that for me, but I'm glad I got strong enough to do it for myself.", "Yes, remove yourself from this very creepy situation and cut ties with Tom, at least for a while. Clearly you see some redeeming qualities or you wouldn't still say you care for him. If you think he'll really hear it, you could try telling him why you're not going and why you need a break in your friendship. His reaction will tell you if there's still a friendship worth keeping. I think that reaction should include him saying \"I'm sorry\" and \"I understand\" and not much more.", "Dude has 100% girlfriendzoned you. For your own safety, ditch him. NTA", "As blunt as you may be with your words, your actions are clearly soft enough that it\u2019s not impacting his behaviour. You need to cut him out because clearly he has no intentions of stopping pursuing you romantically", "As someone who had to cut ties with a grown man and who was a friend at the time because they very blatantly crossed boundaries despite being told upfront I was not interested in anything sexual. Cut ties. It is unlikely to get better considering he asked you out 4 TIMES after he ended his relationship and took that many times to finally back off. The maturity is just not there.", "I had a similar \u2018friend\u2019 and once I got engaged he absolutely ghosted me. Tom isn\u2019t a friend; he\u2019s hoping you\u2019re just playing hard to get!!", "I'm not one of those people who says \"men and women can't be friends.\" I think it's perfectly fine to have close friends of ANY gender. Also most of my friends are some flavor of queer so it's not like the heterosexual norms apply to us to begin with lol. My fianc\u00e9's pansexual and I'm bisexual-- if we couldn't hang out with people of genders we might be attracted to, we couldn't hang out with anyone!\n\nBut all that said, I still think it's incredibly sketchy for a man to ask a woman who has rejected his advances to go to a wedding as a +1. Like, it's *possible* to be a +1 as just a friend, but the default assumption is one of a long-term romantic relationship. Even WITHOUT getting the third degree from his family, is that really a context you want to place yourself in? And with the family involvement added, this is just not a situation you want to be in at all.\n\nIt's not fact that he's attracted to your gender that's the problem, but the fact that he is attracted to *you specifically.* This is NOT a \"just a regular opposite-gender friend\" situation, and your respective genders just increase the likelihood that everyone around you will perceive and treat you as a romantic couple, because heteronormativity. And he doesn't seem like the sort of person who would go to any effort to combat that perception.\n\nNTA, and I agree with a lot of people here saying that you do need to cut this guy off. He's not displayed any ability or willingness to respect the word \"no,\" which is a HUGE red flag in any relationship, romantic or friend or otherwise.\n\n(edit for slight clarification)", "I agree on cutting ties.  I have had a friend similar to this for over 20 years and its a little different because we grew up together so our families know each other.  Everyone knows I was never interested in that way but now both being in our 30's, when he drinks too much, this topic always comes back up.  It sucks because sober him knows better as we have had this conversation.  I had to stop attending events or situations when I know having more than a drink or two will happen.  It's a bummer but I can't handle that conversation anymore.", "Yeah I was in a similar situation as Tom where the girl I was interested in didn\u2019t share my feelings. She wasn\u2019t nearly as blunt as you but I got the message. If Tom was being legit with himself he\u2019d probably cut you off himself as I did to her. Since he\u2019s engaging in self-delusion you should cut him off. He\u2019s not interested in being just friends with you. You\u2019ll be doing him a favor. He\u2019ll be angry and unfair towards you because of the whiplash from 10 years of sunk cost. But he\u2019ll move on eventually. Don\u2019t let him waste any more of his time.", "A complete guess but I suspect Tom hadn\u2019t mentioned to his family because they may think any female he mentions is a possible contender for the position of his wife.  \n\nI\u2019d let Tom know first that you won\u2019t be accompanying him to his brother\u2019s wedding and to let his family know the dinner to review you as to be an appropriate guest is no longer required. \n\nYou may wish to see how things go with Tom but he may be one of those guys who if you are willing to remain friends with them it means there\u2019s still a chance it could change.  If that\u2019s the case then it may need going NC.", "I had a young woman ask me to a wedding reception.  I knew her from being out with a bunch of my friends.  I would talk to her, but in no way (at least to me) did I give her the perception that I wanted to be anything more than friends.  \n\nThe day that she asked me to be a plus one, I thanked her for thinking of me, but respectfully declined.  I had a bad gut feeling that it would not turn out well, especially when there was going to be alcohol at the reception.  Her response was that she yelled at me, calling me ugly and asking if I was gay.  \n\nOP, if your gut is telling you that it's not a good thing to do, listen to it.  I find that my gut feelings are rarely wrong.  Good luck with whatever you choose to do.", "NTA. Just remove yourself. Don't \"join the circus\"--you have no stake in it at all.

Only backed off a little bit when my female partner (fianc\u00e9 is aware, doesn\u2019t give a shit, he fucking loves her) had enough and just grabbed me by the front of my shirt and pulled me down into a very NSFW kiss.

The end of my seemingly infinite patience came when I was standing in line with one of my extremely flaming friends to get lunch and he came up behind me, spun me around and planted one on me.

I know that's not what you thought you were doing and I know you were clear with Tom but this is how it played our for him: Tom knows he's a \"Nice Guy\u2122\" because he's had relationships in the past. He is also a \"Nice Guy\u2122\" because he has a female friend.  Yes, you have rejected him in the past but that's just because you WEREN'T READY but you must be ready now because you said yes.  And everybody in his family knows what a \"Nice Guy\u2122\" he is and they want him to settle down because he's in his 30's now and we all know you must be married in your 30's or your mother will spontaneously combust because who will look after you once she's gone??!  Anyway, you FINALLY agreed to go on a date with Tom,  so obviously you want to marry him and do whatever he wants for the rest of his life, while always taking into account that his mother will come first and you will never be as good as her. And so they need to meet you because obviously Auntie Mary will bw at the wedding and they have to be able to tell hwr how wonderful you and Tom are together and how he's always had a soft spot for you and you know now what a \"Nice Guy\u2122\" he is and you are going to live happily ever after, not like Auntie Maryal's son,  who got married too young and *gasp* had to get a divorce and didn't choose well like Tom did. Because surely if you weren't planning a life with Tom you would have just cut him out of your life after the second attempt of asking you out.

He doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries and he continues to hang out with you and befriend you because deep down he is hoping to change your mind. You need to end this friendship or at least downgrade it to more of an acquaintance-ship. Do not go places alone with him. Do not hang out with him alone, do not be alone with him at any point. This is someone who if you decide you want to keep in your life you need to make the kind of person that you see and hang out with in groups in public places and that is it. I don\u2019t think you should meet his family at all. Instead, I think you should follow your instincts and and cancel as his plus 1. Even if he has not led his family to believe something more serious is going on that whole audition for his family thing is weird (although I can understand it if they are being led to believe you two are dating they may think it\u2019s awkward to meet for the first time at the wedding).

And while I understand that you care for him, \"caring\" for someone can only be your excuse for so long when it's evident that the person in question refuses to extinguish the torch. You may not see it, but he's putting you in a corner. This whole event has become a grandiose manipulation, intended or not. Honestly though, at this point, I wouldn't be surprised if he's romanticized it already, even going so far as to fantasize and formulate a public proposal of sorts as he's caught up in the momentum of wedding bells; a grandiose gesture to get you to 'just see'.\n\nYou need to back out.

The emotions can be too strong, and even if you do your best to accept it as friendship, chances are you're already too invested to accept it, especially if it took a while to admit the feelings.  But really the best thing for both sides is to end the friendship and move on when there's a realization.  It sounds like she's tried so NTA, but she needs to cut the cord; because he's 10 years deep (gawddamn!).  Honestly, I disagree with a lot of people saying he's a creep, he's clearly in love with her. But it's the unhealthy infatuation type and I doubt he's got the wisdom to walk away himself.

I bet he'd probably still want to be friends just in case the wedding doesn't work out...", "Yeah she doesn't help him out at all. It's always him dropping tools to go and help her. She knows about how he feels, even though he's never pushed her, and then she will vent to him about what her latest boyfriend has done or said and then talk about how they made up. Several times I have gone over and seen him only to find him sobbing his heart out because of this. I have suggested to him to cut her out of his life, and I have talked to him about boundaries, i.e. saying \"I don't want to hear about what you and your bf get up to\" but he refuses to listen. So I would say that no, whilst my uncle is in a similar situation he is quite different from Tom.", "She knows. He has never pushed but she knows. She drops occasional hints about \"someday\"  to him and then gets him to help her out with something else. When he was extremely exhausted from work a few years ago, he works in agriculture and was near enough boiled to death from the heat in the summer, he told her ONCE that this time he couldn't help her because it wasn't safe for him to drive as he was concerned about his ability to focus. She basically lit in to him saying he doesn't care about her, emotionally blackmailing him. I got a phone call at 1am because he was driving home from her place after helping her out with some furniture assembly and moving it around her house, him telling me he had crashed his car and was in a&e.
