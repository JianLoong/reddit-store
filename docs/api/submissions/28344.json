He asked me out when we first met and I said no. He's been in a few relationships over the years and had a long-term girlfriend for four years.\n\nTom broke up with his long-term gf in March and asked me out quite a few times afterwards. This caused tension within our friendship, but the last time we spoke about it, he seemed to understand that I wasn't interested, and a relationship with me was never going to be on the table. \n\nHis family has been putting pressure on him settling down and getting married, especially since his brother got engaged. He asked me if I could be his plus one to his big brother's wedding so he wouldn't go alone, and I (reluctantly) said yes. \n\nTom told his brother about me, and his brother said he'd like to meet me before the wedding \"in case it's awkward\" and he doesn't want anyone ruining his wedding. I thought this was a tad strange because I'm only a plus one. I'm not part of the wedding party. But I said sure, arrange something if you want to.\n\nTom's brother has since told his mother and father about me. Now his mother wants to meet me before the wedding too, as Tom said: \"just to make sure you'll fit in with everyone\". I feel like I'm being screened and I'm finding it kind of offensive. \n\nI'm starting to think maybe Tom has implied I'm more than a friend to his family. It's making me uncomfortable.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I pulled out of the wedding?

He's told them he's dating you. I realize that's an assumption on my part, but it seems obvious.\n\nThe smartest thing you can do is back out, and gently start easing him out of your life.", "YWNBTA .... whatever the reason, both you and Tom should be offended. It's maybe OK that the groom would want to meet you, just to know who his brother is bringing to the wedding but the rest of it is BS.   \nI wouldn't go to the wedding.", "I agree with this. I don\u2019t think Tom truly understands that OP will never want to date him and he will never be able to convince her otherwise. \n\nI would say something like \u201cit sounds like your family has misunderstood our situation. I\u2019m coming to the wedding with you as a friend for moral support, and I don\u2019t expect to be included in any of the family or wedding party functions. If you\u2019d invited (insert name of one of your male mutual friends here) to be your plus one, they probably wouldn\u2019t be asking about this. We\u2019re not ever going to be romantically involved, so it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to meet with your family before the wedding.\u201d\n\nAlso, OP, if you\u2019ve never said the words \u201cwe\u2019re not ever going to be romantically involved\u201d to Tom, do it. I know it sounds mean. But it\u2019s the truth, and it doesn\u2019t sound like your previous attempts have gotten through to him. If he wants to stop being friends with you over it, that may actually turn out to be the best thing for both of you.", "> I wouldn\u2019t spend alone time with him ( for safety reasons) and would cut him off.\n\nOMG, you are so over-reacting it's not funny.  Tom may be wanting something more, but dangerous?  You watch too many crime dramas.", "It's just so disheartening that a friend of 10 years was potentially only sticking around to see what they could get. His actions over the last few months since his break up have made me think that you might be right and he's not actually listening, just holding out.", "Tom has seen some hallmark movies and is thinking he can get the girl who always says no into the girl who falls in love with him bc they went to a wedding. He\u2019s a AH\nHonestly it sounds like he\u2019s telling them OP and him are dating. I wouldn\u2019t go. Bc 10-1 they want to get to know her bc he wants her in the family photos", "This. Let's start by having a conversation with him and give him the chance to stop his family. \n\nI doubt it, but for all we know the family is the one jumping to conclusions and Tom never implied anything other than friends. \n\nCommunication is key people.\n\n\nBut if he is wanting you to \"play the gf\" to appease his family then totally back out. That's not what you agreed to and it's rude to not discuss it with you first.", "Agreed. Many weddings have a rule of \"only those in longterm relationships get a plus one\" because nobody wants the photos to be full of randos. I'm betting this wedding has a rule like that and Tom is trying to tell his family OP is his serious girlfriend in an attempt to get to bring her, and in hopes that she will enjoy pretending to be his girlfriend and decide she wants to *actually* be his girlfriend.", "This doesn't sound like a series of interviews, it's more like a full background check.", "I think it's time to bail on the whole friendship. It doesn't sound like Tom is ever going to be able to just be your friend. As soon as he asked you out the first time (during your friendship), the dynamic changed. The fact that he continues to ask you out despite your rejections not only makes him a questionable friend, it makes him a questionable person. Anyone who doesn't understand \"no means no\" is a loose cannon. This whole wedding situation has just escalated the whole ordeal.\n\nI suggest you back out of the wedding and the friendship as well. NTA", "It was a university party, to be fair. Back then, older guys (much older than 22) were regularly at parties we were at, which is super creepy to think about now.", "Yep. \n\nShe needs to get those running shoes on.", "How in the world did you infer bigots from this?", "I've had blunt conversations with him before. Last time I couldn't be more blunt. This is just one thing among many this year that is making me think I should cut ties with him. And it's tough because I do care for him, just not romantically.\n\nRather than meet his family and explain how it is, I'd rather just remove myself from the situation. This whole wedding thing has also made me realise he's never mentioned me to his family either, which was surprising. He's met some of my family at birthdays and such.", "Look generally the 22yos who ask out 17yos are not great people. Considering how many times he has asked you out, he has not ever and will not ever take your \"no\" seriously.", "You put him in the \u201cFriend Zone\u201d because you actually want to be friends but it sounds like he has put you in the \u201cFuck Zone,\u201d he is only pretending to be your friend until he can convince you to date/sleep with him\n\nIf he was your friend he would have accepted your \u201cno\u201d the first time", "Fwiw, the reason why I was asking was because I said it was making me uncomfortable and he got really defensive about it. He was telling me it was normal and I should stop \"being weird\" about it. This pissed me off and I decided to take a step back and have a think, so I wanted to make sure I wasn't the one taking it the wrong way. \n\nHis family is prone to drama from what I've heard (and witnessed, especially after his recent break up). I think I'm best telling him I'm backing out and not leaving it open to discussion.", "Honestly, smart move. Past couple years there\u2019s been this guy in my extended friend circle that manages to ignore or forget every time I\u2019ve been blunt about leaving me alone. Multiple friends have sat him down and told him to leave me alone, and he still doesn\u2019t get it. Or, chooses to not get it. Your friend seems like he\u2019s choosing to not get it too, and there\u2019s always the chance his family is just as delusional as he is. Removing yourself is the smartest option sometimes", "I think that\u2019s the right choice. This seems really weird overall, and cutting ties feels like it\u2019s for the best.", "The family seems really weird. Tell him you cannot make it. If he presses you for a reason, tell him you don\u2019t appreciate having to be \u2018approved\u2019 for doing him a favor. You may get sucked into something weird.", "Some people will never get 'no', no matter how blunt you are with it. I flat out told someone that I didn't like them and that the way they smiled made me want to pop them in the face. They bared their teeth like a grimace/snarl, and it just set me off. He replied that I didn't really mean that and that I was a nice person and I'm like \"No, dude, I'm a bitch. Please stop fucking telling me how I really feel and just fuck all the way off.\"\n\nHe wants there to be something. He's made this be a thing it shouldn't be with his family. It sounds like he's had a thing for you for a decade+. No is never going to be 'no' to him. I think you'd be smarter (and safer) to just cut Tom out of your life. This will not end well, and tbh, going is just going to reinforce this fucked up fantasy he has in his head. He'll think he has a chance. You said yes once, right?", "No means maybe and maybe means yes, for people like this", "The only way to get across to him is to cut him off completely. With him pining for you there's no way the friendship could ever be mutually fulfilling anyway", "I think you should definitely cut him off. It seems like he thinks if he takes you to a wedding with all his family there, you\u2019ll see him in a new, romantic light. \n\nThe fact that he hasn\u2019t respected your no in a decade is scary. Drop him. \n\nGood luck!", "When you are uncomfortable, get out of the situation.  \n\nThis person has put you in uncomfortable situations multiple times. Recently. And over a 10 year time-frame. \n\nYou know what you should do. You do not need validation of your feelings from us!! You being uncomfortable is enough to tell you that you are right!", "Yea but make sure your send what's suggested in a text. This way you have receipts, so when he deleted it you can show the family what you sent when you meet them.", "Remove yourself from the situation. Don\u2019t be his plus one. Inform ahead. Limit the time you spend with him.", "Yeah if you already brought it up and he's ignoring your feelings, I'd back out.", "Trust your gut on this one.  He's not respecting your choices, time to cut your losses."]}
