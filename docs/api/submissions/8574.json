I live with my boyfriend at his dads house who didn\u2019t mind if she came and stayed with us. It was fine when she first moved in,and I got her a job with me and she helped me clean up around the house. Well that stopped a couple months after she moved in. She sleeps on the couch in the living room so it\u2019s the fist thing people see when they come in and she always has dirty dishes and old food sitting around and when I ask her to clean up she always has an attitude and gets rude with me even when I tell her I\u2019m the one who gets in trouble for not having her clean up her mess\u2019s. She has even gotten attitudes with my boyfriend and  I always feel like a half to tiptoe around the house scared I\u2019m going to say something that makes her get mad at me and get rude with me. She constantly ignores me and my boyfriend anytime we try to talk to her or ask her to do something. She doesn\u2019t have a license so I have to drive her everywhere she goes. I just feel like all I do is try to help her and I get from it is an attitude or yelled at. Well today she yells for me to come to the living room and ask me to help her with something with her game and she kicks a $750 printer that I have sitting by the tv and and laughs about it I got pretty upset about it and went and looked at it and she went and sat on the couch and I walk up to her and try to help her with her game and she got rude with me and I told her to figure it out on her own and she got mad and started screaming at me so I told her she can get ready to start staying with my mom because I\u2019m done dealing with her being able to talk to me however she likes and I\u2019m not allowed to say anything back without fear of upsetting her and I just wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t in the wrong.
