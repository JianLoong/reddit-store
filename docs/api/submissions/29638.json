All names changed for anonymity.\r  \n\r  \nI (44F) am married to my hubby, Jimmy (48M) for over two decades. My parents died suddenly in a car accident 10 years ago. I have a younger sister, Abigail (39F) with Downs Syndrome, and Jimmy and I are guardians.  Abigail is my sweet angel on Earth. When my parents passed, I was a working mother of three young kids, helping to build our family business with my husband. At first, Abigail lived with us full time. Jimmy has always been at my side with her care and loves her to bits. After a few months we realized that my sister needed more attention than we could give her. There was just not enough time in the day. We discussed what would be best for her and decided to put her into a private adult home for special needs people. It's very costly (over 10k a month) and comes from our own finances. The facility does all sorts of activities and field trips. She loves her home, her friends and the \"special\" days the facility hosts. We are always stopping by to either visit, sign her out on holidays to spend with family, keep her overnight for special sleep overs with my kids and take her on every vacation with us. We never go more than 24 hours without one of us making sure she's ok.\r  \n\r  \nNow onto the issue. I have a SIL, Jenny (42F) who had her first child after years of trying. She's become the typical first-time mom who believes she invented motherhood and is openly opinionated about things she believes other parents fall short on. I mostly ignore her and so does Jimmy. We hosted a BBQ at my house for Labor Day with my FIL, MIL, Jenny, her husband, baby and my kids. Abigail had a planned trip to the zoo and asked if she could go. Of course, we said OK. While I we were eating, Jenny turned to me and asked me where Abigail was. Her tone was more accusatory than questioning. I simply didn't want to get into it with Jenny, so I said Abigail wanted to stay at the home. Jenny then turned to her hubby and said, \"See this is why it won't ever happen.\" My MIL asked Jenny what she was talking about. Jenny, all snarky, said to the whole table, \"We did our wills last week and knew these two wouldn't be suitable as guardians of our baby if something happened to us. They tossed her sister into a home rather than be real family to her! I won't let that happen to my child.\" I didn't let it show, but I was extremely hurt she could say this. Instead of yelling, I laughed at her and said, \"Well that's great news since I have ZERO desire to raise your kid.\" More was said but that's the gist of it. Jenny left with her family calling me nasty swear words as she walked out. (I might of said a few swear words myself right back at her!)\r  \n\r  \nIt's been over a month now and Jimmy is still getting nasty texts from Jenny demanding I apologize. My MIL knows she overstepped with her comment but is asking me to be the bigger person and say sorry to keep the peace. I refuse.

If she had actual concerns she should have talked to you or her brother. And if she had half a brain she would see that sometimes living in a group home is better than with family who don't have the time or resources to properly care for or enrich the life of a person with special needs. Sounds like you are still involved in Abigail's life and she's happy. That is what's important.\n\nAlso, if SIL does feel this way, she doesn't need to make it known and do so in such a hurtful and insulting way.", "So as the DIL you need to be the bigger person? Why is that? My own mother would have told me off if I acted like your SIL did. But your SIL has a strong personality so your MIL wants to take the easy way out. Is it okay she hurt your feelings but not that you hurt her daughter's? \n\nBTW:  It warms my heart Abigail loves her group home.  \n\nNTA", "Thank you Everyone.  My MIL called me this morning...which prompted the post and asked me to call SIL and make amends. She's concerned about seeing the new baby and SILs threats to not attend Thanksgiving if I don't. I love my MIL and have a normally good relationship with her. That's where I'm feeling the push and if AITA because I'm refusing to apologize. I couldn't get all this in due to post limits. I talked to my husband and he said it's up to me on how I handle this. He thinks Jenny was insulting him as well as me.", "NTA I think something along the likes of \"whew, thank god\" was a great response to her not wanting you to raise her kids lol. Neither of you needed to cuss, but she's definitely the A here, not you. Abigail sounds delightful and you and your husband sound like you do a great job", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour SIL was the one who started off being ugly and you just volleyed it right back at her.\n\nYour MIL is also an asshole for saying you should apologize just to \"keep the peace\".", "NTA you and your husband have been doing everything right IMO, what the SIL said was horrible and all you did was agree with what she said, IMO she should be the one apologizing for her behavior.\n\n If your sister is happy where she is and would rather go on the trip then why not let her? She can clearly make her own decisions when it comes to where she wants to spend her time. \n\nPeople with Down Syndrome are just as capable of making decisions as the rest of us, sometimes people just need a little help just like eldery folks.\nI hope the SIL stops attacking you and your husband thats just disgusting.", "NTA. What's she upset about.? You *agreed* with her! In fact, I probably would've gone further and said, \"Yes, we *tossed* my sister in a home that helps love and care for her, which sounds like more than what your *real family* is going to be able to give your kid if that's your attitude.\"\n\nTell her you'll apologize for your response after she apologizes for her initial, appalling comment.", "\"I did not ask to be guardian to your baby and quite frankly I am amazed that you think anyone wants that job considering how self absorbed, self righteous and clueless you are, aside from being an all around PITA? Feel better for hearing the truth? I know I feel good about saying it out loud for once.\"\n\nNTA. omg. No way. And don't apologize. Lots of us would have sent her packing after the stunt she pulled as a guest in YOUR home.", "NTA.  She needs to come apologize to you before I would ever let her in my house again", "NTA at all. You basically expressed that you are on the same page with your SIL about raising her child, which is not wanting any part of it at all. Was she expecting you to WANT to raise her children? You also have no obligation to be the bigger person and apologize first.", "NTA.  My god the nerve of some people.", "You are NTA and definitely do not owe your SIL any apology.", "NTA. You recognized you couldn\u2019t give your sister Abigail the one on one time she needed and made all the right choices to ensure she would be cared for. She is safe, loved and spends tons of time with you guys. Your SIL seems to be insinuating that you\u2019ve just shunted her aside and never see her. On top of implying that Abigail must be with you at all times for things like she doesn\u2019t have her own friends and fun things she likes to do. Do not apologize. She owes you the apology.", "Nope.  She put her foot in her mouth and you just shoved it in further.  No apology necessary if it isn\u2019t two way!", "NTA\nJenny needs to get blocked! And MIL needa to either keep her nose out of it or twll Jenny she's an awful person and needs to apologize to you. Aren't you lucky you don't havw to spend any time with Jenny anymore.", "NTA 'be a bigger person' always translates into 'please just fold, apologise and make our life easier'..... You have done nothing wrong therefore no apology is required.", "NTA.  I doubt anyone really expects you to apologize, and if you do, you\u2019ll just be feeding Jenny\u2019s asshole flame.", "NTA - It would be a cold day in hell before I'd apologize. But I'm not sure what she was so mad about? That you didn't get on your hands and knees to beg her to raise the kid? WTF?! I mean she literally started all this by speaking about something she knows 0 about, why isn't MIL tell her to apologize?", "NTA What a disgusting thing to say. You were more restrained than I would have been, I\u2019d have thrown her out and never spoken to her again. Nasty.", "Rude was met with rude.  I try very hard to be kind to everyone, but I also believe that \"nice\" (aka the bigger person) is sometimes highly overrated.  \n\nApologizing for this simply tells the SIL that it's OK to be rude.  Advise the MIL that you will agree to a joint apology... you meet up; she apologizes first since her comment came first, and you will then apologize for your role.  \n\nPretty sure SIL won't apologize.  Why should you?", "NTA. Never apologize to \"just to keep the peace\", it's almost as bad as doing it  \"because you're family\" , especially when you've clearly done no wrong.", "Nta sil needs to be shut down and apologize for her nasty words. Next time don't invite her.", "NTA.\nDont appolozige. Why keep contact with this kind of people. Family? Not all of them are good to be arround. Let her be happy in her little perfect world. \n\nShe sounds like an awful, judjmental person, who thinks she is always right and that her baby is the christ on earth. Dont bother.", "NTA\n\n\nYour SIL threw shade at you and got offended when you threw it back. I would say the way you should apologize to her is if she apologizes first", "NTA but take a page from my child\u2019s book. He gives the apology but is very specific and it\u2019s not really an apology.  So here\u2019s one I witnessed when he was in primary school.  I\u2019m sorry you feel that way but your still a jerk.  He officially apologized but didn\u2019t lie.  His thought still to this day is if he has to lie then your getting a two part apology because lying is worse.  Giving an apology without meaning it is a lie just to make someone feel better.  So he doesn\u2019t lie and apologizes.  \n\nOne other time when he shoved a bully and I had to go to the principles office there were two other children besides mine along with their respective parents. One was the bully the other was the bullies victim then there was my son.  The bully was continuously harassing the the other boy we\u2019ll call Joe.  My son told the bully to leave Joe alone.  Mind you my son was twice the bully\u2019s  size in the 3rd grade.  Bully said make me my son pushed him with all his effort 100 lb kid shoving a 65 lb kid means he went sliding the entire length of the cafeteria. So now we\u2019re all here listening Joe is staring at his feet, bully is crying and my son just looks indignant.  Bully\u2019s m9m wants something to be done because her son was humiliated by my son.  I asked what about what your kid did to Joe? Her answer was we aren\u2019t here to discuss that but what my son did to hers.  I looked at her and said we wouldn\u2019t even be here if her son would leave Joe alone.  The principle then said ok let\u2019s be fair if my son would apologize for pushing the bully would that clear this up because no one is getting expelled or suspended?  Bully\u2019s mom with a smile and smirk said yes if me son apologized it would be fine.  Mind you Joe and his mom are being ignored during the entire ordeal.  Principle goes ok apologize for pushing the bully.  My son looks ought at the mom and says no I\u2019m not sorry and I\u2019ll do it again. Joe looked up bully mom ps eye got so big, joes mom tried not to giggle.  Principal says it\u2019s the right thing to do and apologize.  My on in his infinite wisdom asks do you want me to lie or tell the truth.  He explains further if I tell a lie I get in trouble so I tell the truth.  The truth is I\u2019m not sorry.  Just apologize to make him feel better.  My son smiles and says ok.  He looks at Joe and says I\u2019m sorry that the bully is a jerk and hurt your feelings he won\u2019t bother you anymore I promise.  Look at the bully and says do you understand.  Turns to me and said I apologized can we leave?  The bully\u2019s mom looked like a goldfish, Joe\u2019s mom said this is concluded to my satisfaction and there will be no repeat performance correct?  We all left the office nd that kid never bothered Joe again. Moral of the story is it\u2019s ll how you word the apology.  My kid apologized but not the way or to whom they expected.", "Jenny sucks and be glad she won't want anything from you. If Jimmy feels like apologizing fine, but she'll just keep doing this to you. NTA.", "Nta. I worked at a center that did therapeutic horseback riding for disabled kids. The parents would bring them in looking worn out and even though it was only a couple hours break they'd come back looking happier (and likely better caffeinated) and their kids would come out happy with stories and our non verbal kids would just vibrate around. You did what was best for your sister and should never apologize for that. The care and environment they're giving you sister is exactly what she needs and they can provide individualised care and attention when you simply couldn't and there's no shame in that. It would have to be a cold day in hell for me to say sorry to someone who attacked me like that even for the sake of \"peace\" because it would be very temporary with someone like her.", "NTA. Your SIL is the one who needs to be \u201cthe bigger person\u201d and apologize for all of her ignorant nasty behavior. Next time anyone asks you to be the \u201cbigger person\u201d let them know that you didn\u2019t cause the problem and you will not enable bad behavior. It is the responsibility of the person who CAUSED the problem/drama to apologize.", "NTA and don't apologize. You've done nothing to apologize for, but Jenny certainly has. Sounds like you and your family have done what's best for Abigail, and she's happy and thriving in a safe environment with plenty of family involvement.", "NTA but so sick of the \u201cbe a bigger person@ because they know Jenny (others like her) are the Ahole, won\u2019t admit fault or apologize for their behavior.  I\u2019m glad Jenny is leading a fulfilling life.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t apologize to someone abusing me to keep the peace.", "Nta no do not apologize or you will be under her thumb forever.", "Being \"the bigger person \" is vastly overrated.

It is interesting that instead of just ignoring you, she is holding her baby  hostage from your MIL unless you apologize. She either is clueless, self-righteous or she realized that she went to far and is too ashamed to admit it. This is one for your husband to handle. He needs to tell his sister how much her comment hurt the both of you and for that reason, you don't need to be around her until she apologizes to you and you need to tell your MIl that you have nothing to apologize for.

And they were allowed to decorate the way they wanted - there was this one lady down the hall from him, and she had the most adorable decorations and set up in her apartment.  I was in my late 40's at the time and I told my boyfriend about it, and he was like, \"That totally sounds like the life!\"", "My grandma (96) just moved into one of these. It caused a bunch of drama in my family and a bunch of my aunts and uncles aren't speaking to each other because the majority ruled she needed more than home care could offer.\n\nShe ***loves*** it though and has a bunch of friends and even a boyfriend now lol.", "Ever since my mother was in assisted living I thought the same thing. I thought I was the only one. LOL.", "You could also retire to live on a cruise ship (Some sell the cabins) and you get food, cleaning, activities, etc Plus, see the world and apparently it's cheaper than a care home.", "It sounds like college without the homework, I'm so excited for it", "Lol when I was in my early twenties I had a coworker (same age, a lawyer) who also couldn\u2019t wait to move into a retirement community.  I should catch up with her as we\u2019re rapidly approaching the appropriate age.", "I recently had to tour some local senior homes for a loved one. One was, bad, but the rest seemed like a fun place to live. They have all sorts of activities, built in friends that you don't have to travel to see, and nurses for whatever you have going on. The only people that seemed unhappy were the smokers, because they had them on a schedule so they could be supervised.", "LOL my grandmother went into a very nice senior home and both me and my uncle (who were having fun with housing in our state (CA) were jealous. Great activities, great food, beautiful place.", "Honestly one of the things I miss the most about being in college, eating in the dining hall with all my buddies and then the cheap dorm trips to sports events, zoos, etc.", "If hubby and I didn\u2019t have 2 big dogs, we would have gone the \u201csenior living\u201d route when we moved back to Michigan!   \u201cWhere is my jello!\u201d   Lookin forward to it!", "Make sure you have the savings set aside for it though! These places are expensive. I just moved my dad into one and it's over $6k per month and that's a cheaper one. Most are $10k and up per month. Most don't accept Medicare or any insurance. It's all out of pocket. The VA can help with Vets that qualify but the max contribution is about $2,200 per month. Goodness.", "Haha--same. My husband's parents just moved into one and they love it. Meals in the dining room, movie nights, exercise classes, talent shows, trips to the coast, fun activities, new friends.", "My mom lived in one the last year of her life. She didn't like the food, but liked the rest of it alright. I would love it, though her \"rent\" was $5600/month. It was like living in an all-inclusive hotel/resort. There was a pool, food around the clock (though, outside of meal times it was muffins, fruit, yogurt and other snacks like that), a garden with a large koi pond, all kinds of activities and plenty of people to hang out with. Residents were also allowed to have a dog or cat, and one of the \"younger\" residents who did not have a dog used to volunteer to walk other people's dogs...including the site manager's dog that came to work. It was a lovely place.", "Try every Friday open bar Happy Hour social!    Restaurant, movie theater, barber/hair dresser shop, post office, game room, pool, jacuzzi, gym, 2 bedroom 2 full bath, full kitchen and laundry closet apartment with walk out to patio and your parking spot.  Along with all the planned outings, health care/nurses checking on you.  \n\nI absolutely had a blast visting my grandfather!  \nAlthough, the insurance he picked up years ago to afford a place like that is no longer available.", "Having Mario Kart Double Dash tournaments with The Office running on the background\n\nThat's the dream", "I\u2019ve been looking forward to that since my mid 20s.  Just a few more decades to go!", "But I want one with a happy hour!", "I did a gig at an independent living place. They had little apartments where you could work out and eat three kinds of ribs. \n\nMet a wonderful family there was said when one of the residents passed away, got a free meal from the buffet, and took a free chocolate kiss from one of the other residents l.\n\nI told myself that I would live there if I couldn't live alone anymore.", "Definitely.  That is the biggest problem - the facilities are great, and they're priced as such.", "Where can someone sign up for this. I'm asking for a friend or two of course.", "My grandpa lived in a senior's community for awhile, and moved to their more support-centered areas when he developed dementia. He was convinced it was a cruise ship, and was only annoyed that they wouldn't let him in the engine room.\n\nThis was par for the course, since he always wanted to go in the engine room when he used to go on *actual* cruise ships.", "I'm so glad you said this. I have been reading through the comments thinking \"Abigail is an adult, why is it assumed that she would want to live at home with her sister and her niblongs forever.\"", "Do you know of any good ones in the New York or Florida area that can both accommodate the needs of an Orthodox Jew and are suited for a medically fragile, severely cognitively and physically disabled individual who needs round the clock care? I need to start looking in a few years and I don\u2019t even know where to start.", "Dude. Sounds like a place I might enjoy and my biggest issue is ADHD.", "That\u2019s heartbreaking. Any chance that you can get adult protective services involved so your aunt receives proper care?  What you\u2019re describing borders on medical neglect.", "Please don\u2019t be the bigger person. Just let Jenny stew. She sounds hideous.", "Out of pocket yes we do. We were lucky in the tech industry and our business took off so we have the means to be able to do this. I am NOT the NORM. Most adults with needs do not have the luxury of being placed in a facility like this. Our situation could be drastically different if we didn't hit it well with the business. We completely acknowledge this. Maybe my SIL is jealous of the money issue. I don't know. She's just be a challenge for most of my marriage.", "That's wonderful. Many blessings to you and your family!", "\"It'll be a cold day in hell when X would happen\" is a common idiom. They're saying there's zero chance that they would apologise.\n\n\"It's a cold day in hell when I apologise to this person\"", "The old folks home finna be lit when my generation gets there. Gonna be smoking blunts and playing split screen games all day lmao.", "and for once most of us will actually make it to game.", "And you don't have to worry about people working late or having to take care of errands or something. :)", "This is already a thing in some places.", "When I was a news cameraman back in 2010, I was 31 at the time. I got to go on an [Honor Flight](https://www.honorflight.org/) and do a story on it. I got to meet an adorable 87-yr old Navy veteran who was amazing. He was a talker and a charmer. Always joking. Any way, I met his kids at the end of the trip and we all kept in touch and I would go visit him at his senior citizen center where he would try and set me up with the single ladies who worked there. I found out from his daughter that one time he won the election to the council for the building cus she had sent him perfume samples from her job. He then passed those out to the ladies to get their vote. He was what you wanted in a grandpa and he basically became my adopted grandpa as all my grandparents had passed. Sadly he passed away about 6 years ago but my parents and I still laugh about the times we had with him there.", "My wife's grandfather lived in a community like that. He had a nice apartment, lots of activities, and he could still drive during the day, so he was quite popular with the ladies.", "My grandparents visit a nursing home with their band once a week, playing old songst from when the average tennant there was young. I firmly believe that by the time i will be in a nursing home, those kind of volunteers will be playing a lot of Britney Spears, Christina Aguliera and Backstreet Boys.", "They're almost as bad as koalas!", "Oh I wasn\u2019t kidding when I said I can\u2019t wait. It\u2019s what I think about when I talk about being child free. I\u2019m like \u201cya mamas gonna afford the NICE senior living one day.\u201d", "So, I have found one! I\u2019m the OP you\u2019re responding to, and when I was helping my grandma find a place they had a happy hour where they played Spanish bingo (why Spanish, I don\u2019t know. They were all super white women drinking Chardonnay). And they had a resident dog and cat that just wandered the grounds and slept with whoever. It was when I visited that place that I decided I was going to for sure live that life later. And hopefully possible since I am a child free lawyer with a nice 401k.", "I fully expect the 7 figure chunk my 80 year old in laws are sitting on to be wiped out by the time they pass. Right now they\u2019re living off the interest, but with the way their monthly fee keeps going up, and the fact that their parents all lived well into their 90s I figure they\u2019re going to have to start dipping into the principal at some point.", "I am based in Minnesota so, short answer, I don\u2019t have any recommendations in FL. However, always start by doing a cursory search of group homes in the area. A quick google search will start you off. A lot of times, group homes will often know of places  to refer you. If you have a social worker, case manager, etc for disability services for the individual, start asking for resources!", "My cousin (33f) lives in her own studio apartment, but the complex is strictly for adults with special needs &/or disabilities to live somewhat independently. She lives in the neighboring suburb to me, outside of Syracuse, NY. Since she's mostly wheelchair bound (can use a walker for limited amounts of time), part of her monthly income goes to paying for 2 different nurses to be with her for I believe 18 hours/day. My uncle & aunt pay the rest, as well as her subsidized rent. She has one full time nurse who is like part of the family & one part time. Her full time nurse accompanied her to FL to visit my dad, my daughter & I (my daughter & I moved to NY 1.5 years ago, as it's my hometown), plus attended our other cousins wedding last weekend, which was 2 hours away. \n\nI know the apartment complex has 24/7 nurses on staff for emergencies, but residents like my cousin who need help with their basic ADL's still have their own personal nurse they hire separately for a large part of the day.", "My parents, other Aunt and my siblings are in the process of doing that now.  Needless to say it is causing a lot of family drama, but we are at a stage where there is literally no other option. My aunt will not listen to anyone but her oldest son on anything, and for some reason he is against assisted living. My personal thoughts is that my uncle left all his money in trust for his sister care, with the money going to his other siblings once she passes. Meaning that he will inherited less from his mom as the home my aunt was in the day program at (we want her in a place she is familiar with ) is like 14k a month. My family thinks I am being cynical, but it so clear how much she has regressed, he can\u2019t think his mom is providing proper care.", "Got it!", "I was reading a few years ago an article about how the homes for older people have to change, because now the generation of former hippies, \"flower-children \" started to move in. Some funny images popped to my midn then ;) \u262e\ufe0f", "The amount of times I\u2019ve had to tell my residents that non smoking laws also apply to weed is honestly hilarious", "Yep my mum was shocked when she learned that some of her friends used marijuana gummies as pain meds.", "I went to a retirement home in the city once and found out there was a pretty well known apartment on the hallway for smoking. But it wasn't weed and involved a glass stem. Always wild the idea of an septuagenarian in a wheelchair hitting the rock.", "I went home for my mom\u2019s birthday and she said she was about to \u201csmoke some grass\u201d when I left lmao", "Just who they are, who you are , why they\u2019re there , and if you know when the D&D game is?", "My grandma loved living in the nursing home!

And I'm so sorry for your loss.", "I\u2019m very forgetful and fall over all the time because I\u2019m clumsy af. Does that mean I can move to one of these places?

It really does sound fantastic!", "Thank you. Unfortunately, my daughter is a lot less functional than your cousin right now, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind if things change!", "To add, my uncle\u2019s trust would run out in about 9 years at that rate, but my aunt is 70 and we all offered to split the tab for care once the money ran out, not asking my aunt the \u201ccaregiver\u201d or her son to shoulder any of the expected future cost once the trust runs out.", "Never to late to at least be a stoner :)", "I\u2019m a retired 66 yo stoner.  I highly (no pun intended) recommend it.", "I'm a stoner and I wish I could retire!", "My partner and I were talking the other day and he said by the time we're that age retirement homes are gonna have to be set up for LAN parties and gaming and I am so on board for this future lol.", "In the past 10 years or so, the rate of STIs have more than doubled in people over the age of 65.

When recreational pot was legalized in our state, they added a stop at the neighborhood mj dispensary. It's on their little pre-printed form & everything.", "I worked at one in high school and oh boy did it change my view of senior citizens. They partied insanely hard. There was more than 1 STD outbreak & one of the residents was known for giving out drugs to the other residents. \n\nEvery year we threw a \u201cprom\u201d for them and they were all lit before the party even started.", "Old age homes have a big STD problem, actually. It\u2019s not quite as funny as you\u2019d think, but apparently a lot of grandparents are really getting it on.", "I'm sure I read something recently about the residents of an old people's home getting frustrated that the staff played music like Vera Lynn and Glenn Miller that they either didn't know or associated with their parents.", "If you\u2019ve not heard of it \u2018The Thursday Murder Club\u2019 is a great series of books set in an English assisted living place with a bunch of geriatric sleuths.

He was a flirt but a harmless flirt who just wanted to have fun.", "I hate saying this but I think he\u2019s got his eyes on the prize there.
