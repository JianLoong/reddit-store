All names changed for anonymity.\r  \n\r  \nI (44F) am married to my hubby, Jimmy (48M) for over two decades. My parents died suddenly in a car accident 10 years ago. I have a younger sister, Abigail (39F) with Downs Syndrome, and Jimmy and I are guardians.  Abigail is my sweet angel on Earth. When my parents passed, I was a working mother of three young kids, helping to build our family business with my husband. At first, Abigail lived with us full time. Jimmy has always been at my side with her care and loves her to bits. After a few months we realized that my sister needed more attention than we could give her. There was just not enough time in the day. We discussed what would be best for her and decided to put her into a private adult home for special needs people. It's very costly (over 10k a month) and comes from our own finances. The facility does all sorts of activities and field trips. She loves her home, her friends and the \"special\" days the facility hosts. We are always stopping by to either visit, sign her out on holidays to spend with family, keep her overnight for special sleep overs with my kids and take her on every vacation with us. We never go more than 24 hours without one of us making sure she's ok.\r  \n\r  \nNow onto the issue. I have a SIL, Jenny (42F) who had her first child after years of trying. She's become the typical first-time mom who believes she invented motherhood and is openly opinionated about things she believes other parents fall short on. I mostly ignore her and so does Jimmy. We hosted a BBQ at my house for Labor Day with my FIL, MIL, Jenny, her husband, baby and my kids. Abigail had a planned trip to the zoo and asked if she could go. Of course, we said OK. While I we were eating, Jenny turned to me and asked me where Abigail was. Her tone was more accusatory than questioning. I simply didn't want to get into it with Jenny, so I said Abigail wanted to stay at the home. Jenny then turned to her hubby and said, \"See this is why it won't ever happen.\" My MIL asked Jenny what she was talking about. Jenny, all snarky, said to the whole table, \"We did our wills last week and knew these two wouldn't be suitable as guardians of our baby if something happened to us. They tossed her sister into a home rather than be real family to her! I won't let that happen to my child.\" I didn't let it show, but I was extremely hurt she could say this. Instead of yelling, I laughed at her and said, \"Well that's great news since I have ZERO desire to raise your kid.\" More was said but that's the gist of it. Jenny left with her family calling me nasty swear words as she walked out. (I might of said a few swear words myself right back at her!)\r  \n\r  \nIt's been over a month now and Jimmy is still getting nasty texts from Jenny demanding I apologize. My MIL knows she overstepped with her comment but is asking me to be the bigger person and say sorry to keep the peace. I refuse.

If she had actual concerns she should have talked to you or her brother. And if she had half a brain she would see that sometimes living in a group home is better than with family who don't have the time or resources to properly care for or enrich the life of a person with special needs. Sounds like you are still involved in Abigail's life and she's happy. That is what's important.\n\nAlso, if SIL does feel this way, she doesn't need to make it known and do so in such a hurtful and insulting way.", "So as the DIL you need to be the bigger person? Why is that? My own mother would have told me off if I acted like your SIL did. But your SIL has a strong personality so your MIL wants to take the easy way out. Is it okay she hurt your feelings but not that you hurt her daughter's? \n\nBTW:  It warms my heart Abigail loves her group home.  \n\nNTA", "Thank you Everyone.  My MIL called me this morning...which prompted the post and asked me to call SIL and make amends. She's concerned about seeing the new baby and SILs threats to not attend Thanksgiving if I don't. I love my MIL and have a normally good relationship with her. That's where I'm feeling the push and if AITA because I'm refusing to apologize. I couldn't get all this in due to post limits. I talked to my husband and he said it's up to me on how I handle this. He thinks Jenny was insulting him as well as me.", "NTA I think something along the likes of \"whew, thank god\" was a great response to her not wanting you to raise her kids lol. Neither of you needed to cuss, but she's definitely the A here, not you. Abigail sounds delightful and you and your husband sound like you do a great job", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour SIL was the one who started off being ugly and you just volleyed it right back at her.\n\nYour MIL is also an asshole for saying you should apologize just to \"keep the peace\".", "NTA you and your husband have been doing everything right IMO, what the SIL said was horrible and all you did was agree with what she said, IMO she should be the one apologizing for her behavior.\n\n If your sister is happy where she is and would rather go on the trip then why not let her? She can clearly make her own decisions when it comes to where she wants to spend her time. \n\nPeople with Down Syndrome are just as capable of making decisions as the rest of us, sometimes people just need a little help just like eldery folks.\nI hope the SIL stops attacking you and your husband thats just disgusting.", "NTA. What's she upset about.? You *agreed* with her! In fact, I probably would've gone further and said, \"Yes, we *tossed* my sister in a home that helps love and care for her, which sounds like more than what your *real family* is going to be able to give your kid if that's your attitude.\"\n\nTell her you'll apologize for your response after she apologizes for her initial, appalling comment.", "\"I did not ask to be guardian to your baby and quite frankly I am amazed that you think anyone wants that job considering how self absorbed, self righteous and clueless you are, aside from being an all around PITA? Feel better for hearing the truth? I know I feel good about saying it out loud for once.\"\n\nNTA. omg. No way. And don't apologize. Lots of us would have sent her packing after the stunt she pulled as a guest in YOUR home.", "NTA.  She needs to come apologize to you before I would ever let her in my house again", "NTA at all. You basically expressed that you are on the same page with your SIL about raising her child, which is not wanting any part of it at all. Was she expecting you to WANT to raise her children? You also have no obligation to be the bigger person and apologize first.", "NTA.  My god the nerve of some people.", "You are NTA and definitely do not owe your SIL any apology.", "NTA. You recognized you couldn\u2019t give your sister Abigail the one on one time she needed and made all the right choices to ensure she would be cared for. She is safe, loved and spends tons of time with you guys. Your SIL seems to be insinuating that you\u2019ve just shunted her aside and never see her. On top of implying that Abigail must be with you at all times for things like she doesn\u2019t have her own friends and fun things she likes to do. Do not apologize. She owes you the apology.", "Nope.  She put her foot in her mouth and you just shoved it in further.  No apology necessary if it isn\u2019t two way!", "NTA\nJenny needs to get blocked! And MIL needa to either keep her nose out of it or twll Jenny she's an awful person and needs to apologize to you. Aren't you lucky you don't havw to spend any time with Jenny anymore.", "NTA 'be a bigger person' always translates into 'please just fold, apologise and make our life easier'..... You have done nothing wrong therefore no apology is required.", "NTA.  I doubt anyone really expects you to apologize, and if you do, you\u2019ll just be feeding Jenny\u2019s asshole flame.", "NTA - It would be a cold day in hell before I'd apologize. But I'm not sure what she was so mad about? That you didn't get on your hands and knees to beg her to raise the kid? WTF?! I mean she literally started all this by speaking about something she knows 0 about, why isn't MIL tell her to apologize?", "NTA What a disgusting thing to say. You were more restrained than I would have been, I\u2019d have thrown her out and never spoken to her again. Nasty.", "Rude was met with rude.  I try very hard to be kind to everyone, but I also believe that \"nice\" (aka the bigger person) is sometimes highly overrated.  \n\nApologizing for this simply tells the SIL that it's OK to be rude.  Advise the MIL that you will agree to a joint apology... you meet up; she apologizes first since her comment came first, and you will then apologize for your role.  \n\nPretty sure SIL won't apologize.  Why should you?", "NTA. Never apologize to \"just to keep the peace\", it's almost as bad as doing it  \"because you're family\" , especially when you've clearly done no wrong.", "Nta sil needs to be shut down and apologize for her nasty words. Next time don't invite her.", "NTA.\nDont appolozige. Why keep contact with this kind of people. Family? Not all of them are good to be arround. Let her be happy in her little perfect world. \n\nShe sounds like an awful, judjmental person, who thinks she is always right and that her baby is the christ on earth. Dont bother.", "NTA\n\n\nYour SIL threw shade at you and got offended when you threw it back. I would say the way you should apologize to her is if she apologizes first", "NTA but take a page from my child\u2019s book. He gives the apology but is very specific and it\u2019s not really an apology.  So here\u2019s one I witnessed when he was in primary school.  I\u2019m sorry you feel that way but your still a jerk.  He officially apologized but didn\u2019t lie.  His thought still to this day is if he has to lie then your getting a two part apology because lying is worse.  Giving an apology without meaning it is a lie just to make someone feel better.  So he doesn\u2019t lie and apologizes.  \n\nOne other time when he shoved a bully and I had to go to the principles office there were two other children besides mine along with their respective parents. One was the bully the other was the bullies victim then there was my son.  The bully was continuously harassing the the other boy we\u2019ll call Joe.  My son told the bully to leave Joe alone.  Mind you my son was twice the bully\u2019s  size in the 3rd grade.  Bully said make me my son pushed him with all his effort 100 lb kid shoving a 65 lb kid means he went sliding the entire length of the cafeteria. So now we\u2019re all here listening Joe is staring at his feet, bully is crying and my son just looks indignant.  Bully\u2019s m9m wants something to be done because her son was humiliated by my son.  I asked what about what your kid did to Joe? Her answer was we aren\u2019t here to discuss that but what my son did to hers.  I looked at her and said we wouldn\u2019t even be here if her son would leave Joe alone.  The principle then said ok let\u2019s be fair if my son would apologize for pushing the bully would that clear this up because no one is getting expelled or suspended?  Bully\u2019s mom with a smile and smirk said yes if me son apologized it would be fine.  Mind you Joe and his mom are being ignored during the entire ordeal.  Principle goes ok apologize for pushing the bully.  My son looks ought at the mom and says no I\u2019m not sorry and I\u2019ll do it again. Joe looked up bully mom ps eye got so big, joes mom tried not to giggle.  Principal says it\u2019s the right thing to do and apologize.  My on in his infinite wisdom asks do you want me to lie or tell the truth.  He explains further if I tell a lie I get in trouble so I tell the truth.  The truth is I\u2019m not sorry.  Just apologize to make him feel better.  My son smiles and says ok.  He looks at Joe and says I\u2019m sorry that the bully is a jerk and hurt your feelings he won\u2019t bother you anymore I promise.  Look at the bully and says do you understand.  Turns to me and said I apologized can we leave?  The bully\u2019s mom looked like a goldfish, Joe\u2019s mom said this is concluded to my satisfaction and there will be no repeat performance correct?  We all left the office nd that kid never bothered Joe again. Moral of the story is it\u2019s ll how you word the apology.  My kid apologized but not the way or to whom they expected.", "Jenny sucks and be glad she won't want anything from you. If Jimmy feels like apologizing fine, but she'll just keep doing this to you. NTA.", "Nta. I worked at a center that did therapeutic horseback riding for disabled kids. The parents would bring them in looking worn out and even though it was only a couple hours break they'd come back looking happier (and likely better caffeinated) and their kids would come out happy with stories and our non verbal kids would just vibrate around. You did what was best for your sister and should never apologize for that. The care and environment they're giving you sister is exactly what she needs and they can provide individualised care and attention when you simply couldn't and there's no shame in that. It would have to be a cold day in hell for me to say sorry to someone who attacked me like that even for the sake of \"peace\" because it would be very temporary with someone like her.", "NTA. Your SIL is the one who needs to be \u201cthe bigger person\u201d and apologize for all of her ignorant nasty behavior. Next time anyone asks you to be the \u201cbigger person\u201d let them know that you didn\u2019t cause the problem and you will not enable bad behavior. It is the responsibility of the person who CAUSED the problem/drama to apologize.", "NTA and don't apologize. You've done nothing to apologize for, but Jenny certainly has. Sounds like you and your family have done what's best for Abigail, and she's happy and thriving in a safe environment with plenty of family involvement.", "NTA but so sick of the \u201cbe a bigger person@ because they know Jenny (others like her) are the Ahole, won\u2019t admit fault or apologize for their behavior.  I\u2019m glad Jenny is leading a fulfilling life.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t apologize to someone abusing me to keep the peace.", "Nta no do not apologize or you will be under her thumb forever.", "Being \"the bigger person \" is vastly overrated.

It is interesting that instead of just ignoring you, she is holding her baby  hostage from your MIL unless you apologize. She either is clueless, self-righteous or she realized that she went to far and is too ashamed to admit it. This is one for your husband to handle.

I volunteered in a retirement home for 2 summers, and loved it.

Don't listen to anyone else.", "OP, if any apology is due, it is that Jenny owes you an apology.  She set up the situation and didn't like the outcome.  Now, Jenny is weaponizing the situation by holding Thanksgiving hostage.

Let me repeat..nta and good for you. Your description  alone as being like she invented motherhood made me lol on lunch break. And you're  care, attitude and sense of humor are why you are the bigger person, no need to change that direction by apologizing.", "NTA, and good on you for staying calm. If someone insinuated that about me I'd loose my shit in a very destructive way.\n\nMy brother has Downs and he's my favorite person in the whole world.

I really hope you stick to your guns and do not apologize. Plus I don't even understand why you would be apologizing, like what for? You did nothing wrong here! The only reason the MIL is pushing you to apologize first is because she knows for a fact that her own daughter is a brat and you are a much better person than she will ever be.", "NTA\n\nIm sick of people asking the victim to be the better person!", "NTA! Just wanted to come in here and say that as someone who works in one of these adult group home settings with the intellectually disabled, it sounds as if you found the best fit for your sister as she seems to thrive in the environment while still receiving all the care she needs. You and your husband go through a lot just checking in with her daily and keeping her best interests at heart. Someone without the experience that the two of you have endured for the last several years (such as your SIL) has no understanding of what benefits and losses your sister could have been put through because of her diagnosis. Some people do better at home, some do better in a care setting, you guys did what worked best for your sister. Simple as that. \n\nTell your SIL that until she goes through every experience you have done for your sister, she can kick rocks and keep her judgments for herself.", "NTA!!!! I would not apologise if I was in your position. I suppose I'd be willing to tell SIL how it felt when she made her comment, but perhaps it's pointless because she sounds awful.", "100% NTA. What an absolutely hideous thing for her to say or even think. Please don\u2019t ever apologize to her for this. You did nothing wrong, and she\u2019s lucky that\u2019s all you said. And if you apologize, it\u2019ll just encourage even more sickening behavior from her.\n\nI\u2019m so angry on your behalf!", "NTA. Don't make people godparents if they don't desire it", "NTA - I took in my brother who had medical issues and trauma and after struggling for four years I knew it was best to put him in a facility that could care for him better than I could.\n\nDoing that isn\u2019t a decision anyone makes lightly and it\u2019s not an easy on but when you loves someone you gotta do what\u2019s best for them even when it makes you sad.\n\nIt seems like you had a similar train of thought to mine and that you came to a similar conclusions although our situations differ.\n\nYou also found her what seems like a wonderful place and you pay handsomely for it.\n\nYour SIL however is TA.\n\nIf you want to leave someone your children and estate in the event that something happens to you you have to ask them first if they\u2019re ok with accepting that responsibility. \n\n They considered and discarded the possibility without ever discussing it with you.\n\nThen she chose to discuss the whole scenario in front of everyone like that and now she\u2019s mad that her attempt to believe she\u2019s superior ended in her feeling like TA.\n\nWell if she\u2019d have discussed the will thing with you in private and prior to that day she wouldn\u2019t be so embarrassed now.\n\nSo her embarrassment is her own fault and you don\u2019t owe her an apology.", "Jenny was out of line. Jenny owes you an apology. Jenny will inevitably change her tune as soon as she needs something from you. Don't fall for it. NTA", "NTA. Forget \"being the bigger person.\" Your SIL is a crass, opinionated AH, and instead of telling you that you shouldn't have rocked the boat, your in-laws should be shutting HER down.

Oh, and many kudos and plaudits to you for the sacrifices you've made supporting your sister.", "NTA - If she's so sure you would be atrocious parents to her baby, why is she so offended you don't want to raise said baby?", " all ya all need to grow the F up", "NTA. She does not deserved an apology.", "SIL can shut the fuck up and take several seats. I would have gone off on that woman. Your sister is in a great place and you are giving her a great life. But you already know that", "Anytime someone asks you to be the bigger person, it is for their comfort. She was rude and opinionated over something she knows nothing about . You only responded to her insult. Screw being the bigger person.", "NTA", "NTA. Firstly, good for you for providing a happy option for your sister. The SIL is way out of line. Continue to ignore her.", "I'm completely non-special needs and the idea of living in a group home like OP describes sounds bloody fantastic. People who cook and clean form you, a load of friends and trips to the zoo.", "NTA. Jenny orchestrated a situation to publicly call you out and insult you. You did what was right for your sister and made sure she gets the attention and support she needs, you didn\u2019t \u201cdump her\u201d anywhere, you found a nice facility where your sister is happy and taken care of. From what I know from working in groups that support adults with special needs they often prefer the feeling of being independent and more adult that good support homes can offer. It\u2019s clear you love Abigail and did not abandon her or whatever Jenny is claiming. I wouldn\u2019t apologize. I\u2019d say you could try to explain that you did what was best for your sister but it sounds like Jenny is too far up her own arse to see reason anyway.", "I have worked with adults with disabilities like down syndrom. Most of them were living in a group home because that is the most common in my country. It makes them a bit more independent and it is great to live among peers. Most of them worked or had activities during the day. It\u2019s not like you put them in a dungeon and throw away the key. They are cared for and with a bit of help a lot of these adults can live their life as independent as possible. Of course it depends on their own abilities. I know a few people who live in these houses and who have a job, drive a car and can do things like shopping on their own. They just need someone to help them with finances or planning. It\u2019s awesome we let them live their own adult lifes. OP, you are doing great. You check in with your sister, you take her on holidays, she is living a great life! And your SIL is apparently just not clever enough to see this.", "Whenever I see one of these I think of the family member who was in her late 80s and caring for her son in his 60s. She kept him at home until the day she died and there was no one to take him on (his siblings were all older and in their 60s and 70s at that point). While he adjusted better than anyone expected it was still rough to change his entire life at that age. Better to do it younger.", "This place is amazing. I couldn't say everything because of limits but its a big building that houses everyone in their own \"dorm room.\" They host cooking classes, gym classes, art class, take them swimming to the local YMCA, host talent shows, day trips, movie nights. There isn't a day that goes by Abigail doesn't have something to look forward to. At first it was an adjustment, I felt a lot of guilt that first year. But now she's thriving and getting much more enrichment than simply staying in my house, by herself, without much interaction during the day.", "Do not apologize. Stand your ground. She was way out of line. An apology will only aid in convincing her she was right. I would tell your Mother in law you can\u2019t allow for what she said and implied about you and your husband to stand nor will you apologize for the sake of \u201cpeace\u201d to someone who spoke that way about you in your own home. F*ck her and the broom she rode in on.", "It's a cold day in H***. I would apologize to this person.\n\n\nHer relationship with your MIL is her business. \n\nShe is weaponizing that child. That is so sick. Hopefully, your mil realizes this soon.\n\nI would sit your mil down. Let her know you love her and would do almost anything for her, but you can't do this.\n\n\nThe daughter insulted you and how you are with your sister. The care you provide and what your relationship is. You can not overlook this. \n\nThe sil needs to apologize.  \n\nNta", "NTA.  Don't you dare apologize.  You are not the cause of this.  Jenny did all of this, if she doesn't show up for Thanksgiving, that's on her.  She insulted you, your parenting, and loyalty to your family.  Like you would be doing her a favor raising her kid.  Please.", "My apology would be something like \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you think that being a good caregiver means doing what you think makes you look best to other people instead of what is actually best for the person in your care.\u201d\n\nNot very diplomatic tho. \ud83d\ude02", "So say if you decided, for the sake of your MIL, to apologise. What do you think would be the outcome? \n\nWould it stop SIL and that's the last you hear of it? Or would SIL feel vindicated and empowered in her disdainful arrogence, to not only continue her bullying (especially towards you as a target) but to also successfully weaponise her baby to control the family?!!\n\nBullies continue to bully and like hell would I enable that type of behaviour especially in front of the kids and your sister! After all, she is alluding to something horrible and being abusive with it. She *wanted* a fight,  she is so confident in her position she said these things in your home. Next time she could say something directly to your sweet sister! \n\nI would absolutely refuse to apologise and your DH needs to have a firm chat with his mother and the pressure she is putting on you, especially when you are the injured party.

Abigail can decide for herself. She doesn't need to spend a specific holiday with us if she has something else she would rather do. If she wants to come to my house, all she needs to do is ask and I will go pick her up after work. She's called me many times wanting to \"come home.\" and the answer is always yes. The only time we couldn't do this is during Covid. During that time, there were restrictions on visits. But the facility set up video calls during this period and we talked everyday.", "\"I put my love, trust, faith and considerable money, which I could be using to support my children, into the hands of people who can provide Abigail with the attention and care she *deserves*. You just exposed your lack of logic, empathy and humanity, so shut your mouth and get out of my house. Now.\" Apologize? When they serve ice cream donuts in he11, maybe?", "Exactly, totally disregarding the Downs Syndrome, as your children grow and mature they have different interests and desires. It's perfectly natural for them to exercise those and not be present at every \"event.\" Your SIL is ill-informed, not only as to how you are treating Jenny, but how life with growing kids evolves. \n\nDon't apologize. You are doing everything right, and she is the one who should apologize as she's been rude, insulting, and has evidently fabricated a narrative to make herself sound wonderful.", "She thinks the opportunity to raise her kid is some big prize, and when OP said it actually wasn\u2019t, she went into fight mode.  I think it\u2019s also insensitive to bring up the topic in light of what happened to OP\u2019s parents.", "I wish I was a clever as your boy. I was so angry all I could get out was I don't want to raise your kid, so no worries. That's the problem sometimes when being confronted. Afterwards there are so many other things I think of in hindsight that I wish I said. LOL.", "You have an awesome kid!", "Its her sister btw", "Jenny? Is that you?", "My SIL and I have never been close. She's been challenging to say the least. I've tried my best over the years to ignore her sass. This is for the sake of my husband, who had been my best friend and biggest supporter in life. I can't say enough about him and all he's sacrificed for my family. We've always known this selfish side of Jenny and can usually deflect or keep her at bay. But this time she crossed a line with our care of my sister. He's also pissed. He told me he's going to call his mom tonight and let her know we aren't caving to Jenny's manipulations and threats.", "Yeah right now Jenny is making it about her baby. You need to remind MIL that Jenny said you dumped your disabled sister and don\u2019t give a crap about what happened to her. MIL knows that\u2019s not true. And then I\u2019d let her know in no uncertain terms that you will not be apologizing.", "People think I\u2019m crazy when I say this, but I cannot wait until I get old and get to move into one of those senior facilities where they plan outings and everyone eats together and they play bingo. Sounds legit.", "In my neighborhood, we have adult daycare centers. I always get crazy looks when I say I wanna go. They get lunches catered with take out for dinners, nails, hair done, one time I went for something they had a karaoke sing along, they play dominos outside, have a computer class, they even have a pool table. They play cards and see their friends. I'd love to go. It sounds like a blast.", "I work in a seniors community and it\u2019s like being on a cruise.

I work with HS students with disabilities like Abigail\u2019s and deal with stuff like your SIL\u2019s comments frequently when we start planning for \u201cafter HS\u201d.

One student toured her future group home and was SO excited, telling me about her \u201capartment\u201d. Adults with disabilities (generalized statement) want to be independent adults too!
