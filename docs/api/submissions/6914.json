My brother, who died 2 years before my birth is a big no go topic in our household, which I can understand. \n\nLike I already mentioned, two years after my brother has passed away, I came to the world.

My sister, who is five years older than me gave me all the attention my parents were supposed to give me. She took more care of me than my parents did, because the only thing they saw on me was a representation of their dead child. I hated this feeling. I had to grow up with this shitty feeling. My parents once even told me that if I would be a boy, they would\u2019ve named me after my brother. \n\nWhen I turned about 14 years old puberty hit me what changed my mindset and courage, and I finally had the courage to speak up to that topic. \n\nBut when I did, my mother started crying, and my father yelled at me for being so disrespectful. They told me that losing their child was one of the worst things that had ever happened to them and I should take more care about what I say. \nAfter that I never opened this topic again, but recently my mother and I had this talk, whether I want children or not. And then she brought my brother up to the topic again. She again compared me to my brother. And I was so sick of it. I told her to stop, which turned into an argument, and ended up with my mother crying about my brother again. I was so sick of this, so I left the house and stayed over at my sisters place. \n\nAITA ?\n\n//edit: I feel like I need to add this to clarify one thing.

We can point to the cause; that doesn't act as any sort of defense.", "NTA but they kind of are for treating you like that", "Nta And honestly, if they don't watch it, they're going to lose their two other kids to neglect and parentification.", "NTA\n\nYour parents better get some grief counseling and drop this crap before they lose a second child if you choose to go NC with them once you become an adult", "Nta you are suffering also", "NTA, you're not a villain for trying to talk with the people who have been abusing you about their abuse.\n\nYou shouldn't have to live in the shadow of a dead child, and there's no excuse for the mistreating you.\n\nGiven that you already live with your sister, and the two of you have spent your entire life being each other's only real family, it sounds like you need to take them at their message and let them go. They have no plans on ever treating you right, your sister had to be your parent when you were a child. They've already made their choice", "NTA - I think it high time you decide to go LC or NC with your parents.  \nYes what they went through was traumatic and difficult, but you were a child, one they were responsible for. they expect a child to understand and be mature enough to go with it.   \nFor your own peace of mind, cut them out, keep your sister she sounds great.", "NTA", "NTA, they need to learn to stop projecting onto you, that is way too much to put on a teenage girl.", "YNTAH. Your parents need therapy. And consider moving out as soon as it is practical so you can get some healthy space from them.", "NTA.\n\nI had a similar experience. Only no one died. \n\nMy mother cheated in my dad and hurt him pretty bad. My entire life I\u2019ve resembled my mother. My dad was a distant father because when he looked at me he saw my mom and it hurt him. \n\nOnce my step mother, who was extremely abusive, told me when I was 19, that when he was in therapy during the custody fight for me and my brother when we we little, told his therapist during a shared session with him and her, that it hurt to love me because I looked so much like my mom. My step mom spent a majority of my life referring to me as my mothers name and compared me to her. She was a drug addict and my step mom would constantly tell me, a child who had zero idea what drug addiction was really like, that was I was no better than my mother. It took me until I was close to 23 to be able to see my face in the mirror and not my mom. \n\nParent do not know what it\u2019s like when you force a child to live in the shadow of someone else, whether it\u2019s a parent or a sibling. \n\nI\u2019m sorry Op. NTA at all.", "NTA...\n\nAnd your feelings are valid. It sucks to live in the shadows of a deceased loved one. (I have similar circumstance)\n\nNow that you are older you can build your life. You deserve your own story, time for you to be the narrator.", "Hopping on top comment for this.\n\nOP, you are you. You are worth more than this crap from them. There is no good excuse for them to treat you like this.\n\nI lost a child, I mourned for him, he literally passed in my and my husband's arms and it was incredibly painful. 7 years later I still on occasion have teary days.\n\nI also was lucky enough to be blessed with another child 4 years ago. Straight up, they're both boys, there is some similarity of features (as with many siblings), but my 2nd child is himself. I've never thought to play the \"could have been\" game like they do, because it's pointless and all kids are different. I cannot even fathom trying to compare them, because they're different individuals, what your parents are doing (especially for 17 years) baffles me.\n\nAll this to say, you are \ud83d\udcaf NTA. Your parents need a good wake up call. I would look into possibly moving in with your sister or a grandparent/aunt/uncle/etc if feasible for your mental well-being.  You are a unique, amazing kid, and it is THEIR loss that they're ignoring it. Your sister sounds like a rockstar.", "I was about to say this. OP is NTA", "Exactly, it doesn't really sound like there's a relationship for these two ladies to try and save. Their parents chose to not be there for either of them and have no plans on changing", "Then how the fuck is OP and asshole", "Until you lose a child you don't understand the pain. While I agree the parents should go to therapy somethings you don't get over\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I get what you're saying but ESH means Everyone Sucks Here, what you are saying is NAH, no assholes here", "I completely understand how it goes lol", "nta. tell them that they way they have been treating you, they are going to lose another child as soon as you're able to get out of there.", "Wow.  Only AHS in this story is your parents. I'm so sorry you have to deal with this.  \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA. My grandma suffered something similar. Her sibling died in an accident and she was born to sorta replace that sibling. She could never live up to their standards though and as a result she was really almost shunned by her parents. Whether you were born on purpose or an accident you were born and they were responsible for being good parents. They were not as they have continued to carry around trauma so deep that it even affected you instead of getting help. Im sorry for your situation op and I hope you\u2019re able to have a happy future and get whatever sort of family you choose to have just like my grandma did!", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry you and your sister have been exposed to this your whole lives. I hope you both can put a lot of distance from them very soon.\n\nIt\u2019s really tragic: they mourn the loss of their first child so much that they were blind to the two wonderful children right in front of them. I hope they get therapy one day, but you deserve peace.", "NTA : I am so sorry your parents can't see the wonderful child they still have. Please try to remember that you are special. And that your parents are hurting and need help and this is not your fault.", "I know my parents just answered my question that I asked out of curiosity when they said that they\u2019d name me after my brother\u2026 but those words deeply hurt me and are still hurting me. I am aware they didn\u2019t mean it like that, but still it hurt", "My sister and I thought about that too. If I can perhaps move in with her. But things aren\u2019t as simple as they look. After all my parents are still my parents. They can easily get me back due to me not being an adult yet. I would\u2019ve need a good lawyer perhaps.", "NTA at all. WTF are they thinking. Yes they lost a child and I would never want to ever have that happen to me but they are actively punishing you for your existence something they had the choice in. You have no choice at al. I lost my husband on my daughters 15th birthday. She is his mirror image. Is like I had not contribution at all, so when I look at her I see his beautiful blue eyes shining back at me with his hair and his smile. I hurt so much but I was so grateful at the same time because that piece of him lives on in her. They need to either get help or they need to fucking man up. You are a living reminder that are part of him still exist\u2019s in this world that should be grateful for that and I can imagine he would be so disappointed in them for the way they punish you for him being gone. I am glad that you at least have your sister to provide that unconditional love you deserve.", "NTA. And from what it sounds like, your parents are probably going to be without you once you are able to be independent of them.    \ngrief is a hard emotion to get out from under, but if a person wants to, they can live with it without being controlled by it.  from what you wrote, I don\u2019t see that they want to do that.", "Oof.  I feel for you, OP.  My dad constantly compared me to my living brother.  To my face.  he was neglectful too, but that was just down to him being a shit parent in general.\n\nCan't imagine being ignored by parents just because of something you have zero control over.  Your sister should never have been forced to be your parent in their place.\n\nThey lost a son, but you never had parents because of it.  You have every right to be incredibly pissed.\n\nNTA.", "I think you're being far too generous to the parents here. You wrote that their grief must be unfathomable, but the reality is that unfortunately a great many children die around the world every year, and of course most of their parents are saddened, but very few parents take out their grief on other children for a couple of decades.", "It always astounds me when I read a story where a kid finds out that they were not wanted or were accidentally conceived. Only a horrible parent would feel such a thing, and only an absolutely horrible parent would say such a thing."]}
