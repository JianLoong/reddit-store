So our parents came up with a one size fits all solution.  They say us down and told us that they would bail us out exactly once.  Whether that meant actual bail or just help with a problem we got ourselves into was left up to interpretation.  \n\nIt was a scare tactic and it worked.  We all started thinking about what would happen if we did stupid shit.  Out of ten cousins only my cousin Victor ever actually had to be bailed out of jail.  The rest of us chose to behave ourselves or at least keep that one bit of help in our back pockets for real emergencies. We all helped each other out instead of going to our parents.  We formed a really tight friendship that added to our family love for each other.  \n\nWe all eventually grew up and never had to call on our parents for help.  But we all remembered that rule and we all used it with our kids.  One time. That's all you get.  \n\nI married my ex-wife ten years ago. She had an eight year old son and his father hated me.  He told my stepson that I wasn't allowed to discipline him. And that he didn't have to do as I told him.  My ex and I eventually divorced because of her refusal to stand against this. It was part of a lot of the problems in our marriage. I was not perfect and at least 50% of the reasons for our divorce are on me.  We have two children of our own that we are co-parenting with little trouble. But my stepson dislikes them and actually told me he was happy when his mother and I divorced when he was 17. \n\nWell he was just arrested for something.  And he remembered me telling him the rules about bail.  So he called me to get help.  I said no.  He is an adult now and I am no longer married to his mother. He is not my responsibility.  He called me an asshole and said that he knew that I never really considered him family.  \n\nMy ex and his father called me to ask for help bailing him out because they cannot afford it.  I said that they had both made sure that I knew that I had no authority over the kid and that I felt like I also have no responsibility for him.  She asked if I could please advance her the child support for my kids so she could bail him out.  I can afford to do this but I won't. That money is meant for her to take care of our kids. Not to help that kid.  \n\nHis father called me an asshole for making a kid that was in my life for nine years feel like I never cared about him. I laughed at him. I told him that he was the reason I never formed a relationship with my stepson.  I told him to take care of his own kid.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672572206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100hpcf/aita_for_not_bailing_my_stepson_out_of_jail/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To me, giving my word and keeping it is important.

But on the other hand you sound like a bit of a jerk, with yourfocus on discipline as the defining aspect of whether you could have a positive influence on him as a parental figure or even love him, especially since your own family tradition seems not based on discipline but on encouraging children to see consequences, and your petty laughing at his bio dad trying to help him, even if the effort was manipulative and laden with irony.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You never stop being responsible for the things you do-and creating a whole new human is a huge thing to do. Absolutely children are people that become adults and needs must take some responsibility for themselves but whoever made them will always be responsible for their existence. \n\nThat said, you didnt make this kid. You still spent 9 years trying to take on at least partial responsibility as if you had tho, and you were rejected at every turn (with, ofc, the necessary internet qualifer of if your account is correct, accurate and honest). \n\nYou were repeatedly told by everyone involved to keep your hands off-why anybody is expecting different now isnt a mystery but it sure is something not nice.  \n\nTheres literally no reason for you to help this person-and thats all this kid is, just a random person that you used to know and tried to love. \n\nLove is the answer to all things but it cant be abused or it becomes corrupted and turns into other things that call themselves love. \n\nThe only thing that i can say is that spending the money might be worth it if only to make sure your actual children arent affected. But that also depends on how close yall live and other things im sure you can reason out. If all is well there then just ignore this situation. \n\nGL and hny NTA \n\nEDIT: typo", "NTA.

He turned 18 in August.  No there was no debriefing.  I signed over the education fun inset up to his mom and never even talked to him.  \n\nI don't base my relationship with my kids on discipline.

If it's a lot I'd lean towards AH, because given the circumstances it's a really shitty thing to hold against him. Accepting a new father figure after a divorce is a hellish task for a child under the best of circumstances. If the actual father actively tries to sabotage the relationship, there is nothing left to blame on the kid. Add to that the normal puberty and shit is guaranteed to hit the fan. Don't punish the kid for that (you are not allowed to \ud83d\ude05 - sorry, couldn't resist). Don't punish the kid because you (rightfully) hate the father.\n\n\nYou have no obligation of course, the deal can reasonably be expected to have ended after you divorced his mom.
