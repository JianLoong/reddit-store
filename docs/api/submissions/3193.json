Their grandpa was also visiting from out of the country and he felt the same and I could tell he was sad they didn\u2019t want to eat with us. It\u2019s a holiday and they always eat in their rooms so it would have been nice if we could all have spent time together for once. My partner tells me they never were forced to eat together growing up so they\u2019re just used to staying in their rooms for dinner. Also we have an almost 8 month old and she is always critiquing my parenting. I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with suggesting that she should make her children at least sit down at the table with us as it\u2019s the polite thing to do but it seems she doesn\u2019t care to teach them social standards and that it\u2019s rude to just stay in your room the entire night when family is there. \n\nETA: I did NOT keep going after she said they wouldn\u2019t be eating with us.

Yes as an adult and teenagers, they can't be forced to do this, but particularly on a holiday with family from out of the country visiting it is an expected social norm they would do this. \n\nCan they be forced to adhere to this social convention? No. However, it isn't inappropriate to let them know it would be appreciated by the family if they adhered to the convention and that dinner is ready if they would like to join the family. \n\nYour MILs behaviour to you isn't relevant here. Just because she insults you doesn't give you the right to do the same back - be the bigger person.

It is fine to say something when someone does something weird. Expecting the family to come out of their rooms for an holyday dinner is not unresonable especially when relatives visit from far away. Maybe your inlaws are the AH for not setting reasonable limits with their children. A 23 year old can decide for themselve, so he's also the AH for making his grandpa sad by not even comming out of his room the one time grandpa is there. \nYou would've been te AH for pushing it further (even if you're right, not your place), maybe you pushed a little to far, but not that much.

It is ridiculous that MIL can't ask her kids to join the family for a damn meal.

Just because they weren\u2019t forced to eat dinner together every night growing up doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not weird that they don\u2019t eat holiday meals together as a family.

In my family, there was zero chance we were bringing food to our bedrooms to eat. No glasses, mugs, or cups outside the kitchen either. If you want food or drink, you have it in the kitchen. There was zero chance we were having dinner anywhere but the kitchen table. And if we were all home, we're eating together. I don't even think I've been to someone's house where a kid got to pass on family dinner to hang out in their room. You either eat with the family or you don't get dinner.   \n\n\nPlus, with this being Thanksgiving, I couldn't fathom the idea of having guests over and letting my kids sit in their rooms and not eat with the rest of the family.  Anytime I tried to dip from a family thing at my parent's house, they'd call me back downstairs. If I didn't come within 5-10 minutes there was hell to pay.

It's as though these family members are not interested in anyone other than themselves and have no real concept of family dinners.  That is not a usual dynamic but it's what the inlaws have fostered.  It is rude to hide in your room when you know that you are meant to be sitting down to a dinner.   There are exceptions such as neurodiversities where you are overwhelmed with too many people and need a time out or other logical stuff but this doesn't sound like that.\n\nNo one should be forced to a dinner they don't want to be at but the invitation was wrong.\n\nIt is what is is.

As a child/teenager I wouldn't have been allowed to hide away in my room during the holidays, I can do that every other day of the year. Special occasions that focus on family and togetherness in my mind, should be treasured. \n\nThere were times of course I didn't want to sit with family, but my parents always enforced it, and I'm glad they did especially now that my dad and grandmother are gone and I'll always have those memories. \n\nI agree they should have came out the room and showed their faces especially if their grandfather came from such a long distance.

I just think that everyone sucks.\n\nEdited Pronouns", "\"they should be forced to talk to me\" - insufferable people who no one wants to talk to.", "23 is ridiculously old to be acting like an awkward teen, that's just a product of bad parenting.", "Exactly, I'm very introverted and have a low social battery, but ignoring guests in your home and hiding away is just plain bad manners (unless there's abuse going on obvs).", "True but there could always be some dish they couldn\u2019t break into yet now being served. I have to take social breaks at holidays. But my family lets me know when it is ready so I have the option.", "All I said was that it was thanksgiving so we should all be sitting together for dinner. That was all. I do think she should force them to be social with family on a day that\u2019s literally all about spending time with family. But I did not say this. It\u2019s just how I feel.", "I love this because once my mother was old enough for her own place, she was MIL. She saw how cringy it was making people be social when they really didn\u2019t want to during holiday get togethers and designated a room in our home just for that. She watched how much family would try and make everyone socialize because they didn\u2019t believe in social anxiety. We were just being stupid and shy when it\u2019s really the fact that people shouldn\u2019t have to be forced to socialize. Hell how does she know they don\u2019t have an issue with someone who\u2019s there that they don\u2019t want to be around? I mean you just never know.", "[deleted]", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overbearing to suggest family eat dinner together on Thanksgiving lol. So yeah, I am judging you if you wouldn\u2019t be the type of parent to at least teach your children to be polite", "You seem like the kind of person I wouldn't leave my room to interact with.", "I wouldn't necessarily want to sit at a table full of people eating just to socialise. Watching everyone else eat when I'm not hungry can be quite uncomfortable.", "No. People can choose whether or not they want to socialise, it isn\u2019t compulsory. There a things people *have* to do and things people *choose* to do or not do.", "It doesn\u2019t matter what you think should happen, nobody should be forced into a social situation they don\u2019t want to be in. Your feelings about it are irrelevant, especially when you\u2019re in someone else\u2019s home, you\u2019re still TA.", "You did say this. When you say \"We should all be sitting together for thanksgiving dinner\" then that's exactly what you mean, and everyone knows this.", "That is an oxymoron right there - forcing to be social and spend time with family. YTA\n\nI feel that I should elaborate on this: spending quality time with family and forcing it are mutually exclusive. OP\u2019s expectations are ridiculous.", "But you did. \nYou were told they weren\u2019t coming down and then you suggested she make them come down and sit and watch you all eat. \n\nAs soon as she said they weren\u2019t coming down you should have stopped. That was it. You got a full answer there. \n\nInstead, you decided to insert your 2 cents and pushed for them to come down after it had already been decided by the parent, homeowner and host.", "Your parents failed to teach you to be polite, you're demanding a teenager and an adult come sit and be social against their will, they weren't locked in their rooms, they had a choice and they made it, I'm still going with, you were a major reason they chose to not socialize. You might want to get off your high horse, because you whine about your MIL being critical of your parenting, and you're shitting all over her parenting. You were being overbearing, you asked once, were told, then continued to push for what YOU wanted. You stomped all over all sorts of boundaries, but, you won't see that, because you're too wrapped up in shitting all over your MIL.", "Maybe you should judge your parents then because you weren't polite and you're being a judgemental arsehole because MIL runs her house different.  Different doesn't equal bad.", "From your username it doesn't seem like anyone ever wants to hang out with you.", ">Their grandpa was also visiting from out of the country and he felt the same \n\nPeople can choose to not interact but that doesn't mean quite frankly its not rude. It takes literally nothing for you to spend some time with family members visiting from really far during a special occasion. You can keep arguing about compulsory or not, I'm just saying it's a dick move to not do so. \n\nYou can choose to not attend meetings at work, but that doesn't mean it won't affect your overall work performance. Similarly you can choose to not go to an office Christmas party or whatever, but to pretend it won't hurt your chances of promotion is something only people without real life experience will do. They can choose to ignore the grandpa but then can't complain when he leaves them out of his will.", "They don\u2019t want to be in it because she raised them be this way. It\u2019s not like we all eat together and this was a one time thing. It\u2019s always this way and it\u2019s weird af to me that you wouldn\u2019t want to teach your children how to be sociable. I just wanted to point out to her that even if they don\u2019t feel like it it\u2019s still polite to interact with your family members.", "This was in no way an attempt to challenge my MIL like she does to me in regards to my parenting. I GENUINELY just find it strange that there are family members in the house who are just locked in their rooms not spending time with family on a day that is centered around being with family. And imagine having your grandpa over from another country and not even having dinner with him? That\u2019s so rude and I as a parent would let it be known that their presence would be greatly appreciated for 30 minutes to spend some family time. I was defiantly raised to be polite which is why this behavior is so ridiculous to me", "Seems like a very convenient edit to try and stop her getting loads of YTA responses to me. \n\nYou thinking it\u2019s a dick move is fine, you\u2019re entitled to your own opinion, and if you think it\u2019s rude then fine. (I disagree that it\u2019s rude to not interact with people if you don\u2019t want to.) It\u2019s still completely different to work responsibilities.", "Your preferences don't override their comfort. It doesn't matter why they don't want to be social. \n\nRespect people's boundaries. THAT is polite.", "So you don't want her opinion on how to raise your child but feel it's your place to comment on how she has/is raising hers? Seems hypocritical to me, and noone should be forced to spend time with family it may just breed resentment", "It is none of your business. I am not sure why you don\u2019t understand that.", "You keep using the word \"force\" and somehow don't see why YTA.", "You really don't get it do you? You asked, were told they had chosen to stay in their rooms, and you continued to push. It's not up to you to suggest repeatedly that a teenager and an adult conform to YOUR idea of normal, you weren't being polite when you repeatedly demanded they socialize\n\n>I was defiantly raised to be polite which is why this behavior is so ridiculous to me\n\n\nI know you meant definitely, but, the error is more apt. You are bound and determined to prove you are right in this situation, but, as it's not your house, not your kids, it's also not your place to demand anyone do anything.", "They probably don\u2019t want to be social because OP has been living in their house and doesn\u2019t like her MIL. Her post history is quite illuminating.", "Well, thank you for your honest opinion. I truly was not trying to overstep anyone\u2019s boundaries. I just really wanted to spend time with all of them and perhaps I went about it in the wrong way.", "Force probably wasn\u2019t the right word. I think she should have at least *suggested* that even if they weren\u2019t hungry that they should still sit at the table.", "Oh my god, how many times do you use the word \u201cl\u201d when talking about what other people do", "So they should sit and watch everyone eat?", "Idk I mean I wouldn\u2019t mind sitting down to interact with my family after they busted their ass to cook for everyone. You don\u2019t just eat at a dinner table, you socialize and enjoy the company of your loved ones."]}
