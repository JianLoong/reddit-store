Our oldest has always been closest to our 13 y/o daughter, our 13 y/o son isn\u2019t that close to any of his siblings because none like sports like he does. Our kids normally get along pretty well though. Recently, there has been trouble with our older set of twins.\n\nA few weeks ago, I got a call from the middle school, apparently my daughter and a group of girls she was friends with were picking on a boy for being gay. Our daughter is indefinitely grounded, had her phone taken away among some other things. Our daughter\u2019s friend group is a group of pretty popular kids, but some of their friends have dropped them. Our son is very embarrassed by his twin sister and in the past few weeks, they haven\u2019t been on good terms.\n\nMy husband and I have sat down with our son and he\u2019s said he has classes with the boy and said he\u2019s a nice kid and thinks his sister is terrible for doing this. The boy is ok thankfully, he has good friends and my son has tried to talk to him to make sure he knows he doesn\u2019t approve of his sister\u2019s behavior. Our daughter still thinks it\u2019s an \u201coverreaction\u201d, which is probably coming from some peers at school feeding her this.\n\nYesterday, my sister was picking up my kids for me, our son was at the gym and our two oldest daughters were getting their nails done for the oldest\u2019s upcoming sweet 16 (in less then a week), the girls were picked up first and then my sister went to get my son. Our 13 y/o daughter asked him what the gym was like, he refused to talk and stuff escalated from there.\n\nLast night, our oldest said she doesn\u2019t want her brother coming because she doesn\u2019t want the twins to fight and think he\u2019s in the wrong for \u201cholding a grudge\u201d and said that her sister just \u201cmade a mistake, even if a big one\u201d. My husband and I talked and agreed that we wouldn\u2019t allow that, as we see it as a reward for the homophobia. The mani-pedi was also the first time our 13 y/o was allowed out since the incident, because she is grounded, we let her do this because we didn\u2019t want her behavior affecting our oldest negatively.\n\nHowever, when we were talking about this with my parents and siblings, they said that it should be up to our oldest because it\u2019s her day, not ours. They said while they think our 13 y/o\u2019s behavior was unacceptable,  and said she should be punished, that it\u2019s \u201cnot our choice\u201d who to invite and who not to invite.

I told my daughter she could not uninvite her brother from her sweet 16 party, she wants to uninvite him because he and his twin/our 13 y/o daughter have not been getting along after our 13 y/o daughter was outed as a bully, bullying a boy for being gay. Our oldest thinks he's holding a grudge and should let go.\n\n2. While we told her no because we feel like it would reward our daughter's homophobia, my parents and siblings are telling me that our daughter should have the right to choose to come to the party, even if we disagree with it and said while they disagree with our 13 y/o's homophobia, it's our oldest's choice in who to invite.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm honestly surprised your 13yo daughter is allowed to go to this party. I know you don't want to upset you 15yo daughter but, 13(F) made her bed and now I think she should have to lie in it. She shouldn't be able to avoid punishment just because her sister doesn't want her to be punished. That's not how the world works. \n\nAs for 15(F), I would tell her that she's lucky 13(F) is allowed to come at all and point this out to 13(F) as well. Tell the twins they aren't even allowed to talk to each other at the party and if they engage with each other and there's drama, then both of them will be kicked out. \n\nAnd as for your family members, let them know two things: 1. You're paying for the party so you ABSOLUTELY get a say as to who is and isn't invited and 2. although it's your oldest daughter's sweet 16, she doesn't get to use that as a \"get out of jail free\" card for her sister.", "NTA\n\nBy your oldest's logic, the F13 should be left out instead because she made the mistake and her brother is just upset about it. You're paying for the party and have the final say on the guest list. If he'd done something awful to her, I could see it. But all he's done is continue to be upset at the bad thing she did.\n\nNow, info: Has she shown any genuine regret for her actions? Young teens can be dumb and make stupid mistakes that shouldn't be held against them once they make up for what they did, but if she's just ignoring it and not sorry, then your son is right to still not be happy with her. No one is owed forgiveness -- especially not for something they haven't truly apologized for. Like, has she told the kid she bullied that she's sorry, or anything?", "NTA\n\nYour son is showing you he has a great moral compass and will stick to what he knows is right even if it makes things at home uncomfortable for him. And he tries to stay silent while his twin wouldn\u2019t let it go.\n\nThe fact that she\u2019s still acting out does make it seem like her punishment isn\u2019t hitting home.\n\nAnd, off the little information given it\u2019s a little concerning that your eldest is choosing to support her sister at the expense of her brother considering the circumstances. I get that they are closer, but this isn\u2019t a case of a sibling spat. She was homophobic, a bully and seems to think that her brother calling out that he disagrees gives her permission to pick at him now.", "YWBTA if you tell your son he can't come to a family event because he stood up against homophobia...especially when that homophobia came from a sibling. Your son did the right thing, your daughter did the wrong thing, and now your older daughter is supporting her sister's homophobia. It's not your son who's holding a drudge, it's your oldest daughter. She's taking a side--and she's on the WRONG side.", "Your 16yo isn't taking the 13yo's punishment seriously because you kinda of aren't.   She's grounded and you still let her have a spa day with big sis.", "NTA. I agree with your decisions, especially not to reward homophobia. I presume that you are paying for the party, so you get to say who attends. Doing otherwise will reinforce the birthday girl's sense of entitlement. They are all old enough not fight and spoil a party; I suggest you make it clear the behavior that is expected from all of them at the event if they want you to continue to make parties for them.", "NTA. I could maybe see it being ok if this was setup originally as a party just for girls, or as a party just for her friends. But it seems thats not the case and she is actively uninviting him when it was your other daughter who did something bad. You are right, she shouldnt be rewarded for her behavior and your son punished. I think you should tell your oldest daughter that either they both go, or if she is worried about them fighting, then your 13 year old daughter will have to be the one to miss the party.\n\nAlso I am assuming that as a 16 year old girl, you are the ones paying for and hosting this party for her.", "NTA- you have the wrong twin going to the party. the 13f should be kept home due to her behavior BOTH times. She was in trouble already for what she said to the child at school, and then picked a fight with her brother as he wants nothing to do with her.  Yet HE is the one being labeled as the trouble maker?? No. She is and you rewarded her with getting her nails done and going to a party.", "NTA. Your 16YO daughter can\u2019t uninvite people from a party you are throwing. Your son did nothing wrong and should be invited.", "NTA You and your husband are the parents, you're 16 year old daughter is the child. She doesn't get to decide how your family functions, you do.", "Frankly, when 13F picked a fight with her brother when he refused to talk, I'd have said that was Strike 2.", "Your parents and siblings are wrong.  As long as you're paying for the \"sweet 16\" birthday party, you have a lot to say about the guest list,  especially when it comes to siblings being invited. \n\nYour soon to be 16 is wrong. Homophobia is not a mistake,  not even a big one. It's wrong -- ethically, morally, and socially.   Your son did the absolutely right thing to help fix his twin sister's homophobic teasing of a classmate.  And the 16 year old is diminishing the sister's wrong doing, especially by uninviting their brother. \n\nNTA", "> However, when we were talking about this with my parents and siblings, they said that it should be up to our oldest because it\u2019s her day, not ours.\n\n2 things:\n\n1. She's not paying for the party, so she doesn't get to control the guest list.\n2. This isn't just another guest, it's her own brother.\n\nWhat nonsense.

I think there's more going on here in the family dynamics than you know. Your son is seemingly being scapegoated and bullied by the girls. I wonder whether your 13yo is getting her beliefs from the 16yo? \n* No, your 16yo daughter should not be allowed to uninvite the family member who hasn't done anything wrong. If anybody should be uninvited from the party, it absolutely should be your 13yo daughter who is grounded anyhow so probably shouldn't be attending a party.

Up to you if you want to defer to your kids. \n\nI have to say though, your oldest has a really warped way of thinking. Same with your other family members. So homophobia is acceptable, but reacting negatively to it is not? Your 13 year old son should probably stay away from the party for *his* sake", "NTA, but I would make something clear to the twins. If either one of them starts any trouble at the party for whatever reason, it'll equal immediate ejection from the celebration and being grounded for at least a week. That way they'll know that there will be consequences if they cause any trouble on their big sister's day, which should hopefully keep them under control for the time being.", "NTA  \nBut honestly if you decide to uninvite the 13 year old boy, then the daughter should be uninvited too as punishment for her behavior. Honestly maybe the daughter shouldn't be allowed to go at all and you can ask your 13 year old son what he wants to do? Maybe he won't want to go?", "YTA for how you're handling the situation with your daughter's bullying and homophobia. Throwing out some indefinite, indeterminate punishment with random exceptions is reactionary and unhelpful. Clearly, your daughter isn't learning anything if she thinks you are overreacting.", "NTA, so she wants to exclude one sibling? So she\u2019s rewarding one and punishing the other? As a parent sometimes you need to step forward and tell the twins that it\u2019s their sister\u2019s day and both of them will behave appropriately and tell your older daughter she doesn\u2019t get to exclude a family member for a a squabble that doesn\u2019t involve her well being. If the male twin was hurtful or antagonistic to his older sister, I would say she had every right to draw that line, but his behaviour was not out of line for what his twin did.", "NAH - Except for your 13 yo daughter.

All you said was that your 13yo daughter was \"picking on a boy for being gay,\" but that could mean anything from slurs to long-term bullying to even physical harassment. It's obviously something big enough that your son feels like he doesn't trust his twin anymore. It's also worrying that your eldest heard about whatever happened and doesn't think it's a big deal. Have you talked to your daughter more than just saying \"homophobia is bad\" and a punishment? Do you know where her behavior is coming from? Have you sat the whole family down to have a talk about it? \n\nNTA for wanting to make sure your 13YO knows her actions were not okay, but like ... you've gotta decide what to do about this. \"Indefinite punishment\" doesn't really work until you can have clear rules about what needs to happen for this to be over.", "NTA - But your 13yr old daughter is a piece of work! You really need to be VERY intentional about nipping this homophobia in the bud. It can - and will - turn into other forms of bullying and exhaust behaviors.\n\nNOT letting 13F go get her nails would not have been punishing your 16F - she could have found someone else to go with. You didn't hold true to the consequences and all that does is teach her that what she did wasn't *that* bad.\n\nAs far as the party, YOU ARE THE PARENTS! It's not HER party - YOU are throwing her a party with your resources. If you exclude your 13M, you are once again telling your 13F that she wasn't really the one in the wrong.", "ESH I guess? Mani-pedi when grounded? You and your husband need to not bend your punishment on a whim. No wonder the 13 year old thinks what she\u2019s done is fine. And no wonder the 15 year old things her brother is holding a grudge, because her parents clearly find the 13 year olds behaviour forgiven and in the past. You and your husband are sending mixed messages to your two oldest daughters. You also need to sit your oldest daughter down and teach her the basics of what a mistake is and what an apology is..two things your 13 year seems to not have done. In regards to your own parents, they have already done their parenting so their opinion on your parenting or this situation is just that, an opinion.  With minor siblings, who is and isn\u2019t invited ultimately is up to the parents of the birthday person.

Like in what world is that ok? Your son probably understand this is not a one time thing even though this might be the one time she got in trouble! How about you start acting like a parent rather then playing the part.", "NTA.  Your eldest says the 13 y/o made a mistake, but she has not acknowledged that mistake, or apologized - instead doubling down saying its an overreaction.  But this isn't helped by stuff like this - \"because she is grounded, we let her do this because we didn\u2019t want her behavior affecting our oldest negatively.\"    You let your 13 y/o daughter get a time out from grounding for a mani / pedi.  Your eldest could have gone alone (and that would not have effected her negatively).

Which one(s) are you intending to punish?", "NTA for keeping your son at the party, but Y T A that your daughter is still allowed to go and that you got her a mani-pedi. The fact that your daughter thinks this is an overreaction, rather than being consumed by guilt that she did something so horrible, is really concerning.", "NTA for saying that your son should be invited and go. But the parenting is totally lacking here. From what you said, your 13 yo son, who is still a child, is the only truly decent human among you. He has talked to the boy, was kind and respectful to him, ensured he was okay, and made clear that his family doesn't represent him or represent goodness. He did everything he could to make this right. What has your 13yo daughter done? Lost her phone (temporarily) and friends (who see her for who she really is)? What has the 15yo done? Not told her younger sister that she better wake up and pay attention, because  good humans don't do this shit. And what have you done? Nothing. 100% nothing. You and Dad have not in any way modeled for her what should be done in this situation, you haven't guided her to figure out a way to apologize for this mess, you haven't looked for any resources to teach her what it means to be an LGBTQ teen and how her actions contribute to real harm and hurt. And you have the perfect model for how to do this right in your face. So, NTA judgement for your question. Had you asked the right question, I would have given you a different answer. Go hug your son. He's a good egg.", "NTA. \n\nDude, you\u2019re over complicating this. You are WAY to involved in the back and forth of their teenage shenanigans (other than doing your best to correct your F13\u2019s behavior). You aren\u2019t one of the teens yourself, a lot of these details are irrelevant.\n\nYour oldest is 16. She has earned more and more autonomy, but she is still a minor and your child. She doesn\u2019t get to banish one of her siblings from a family party for any reason she wants when you disagree. You correctly recognize her reason is a bad reason. The kids are going to have to suck it up and be in one place together, because that\u2019s the deal when you\u2019re a family and you\u2019re kids.", "NTA tell your siblings and parents they can pay for the party then as you will not exclude one of your children because of another's homophobia.", "So your oldest is a homophobic bigot too? Just like the other one? Is that why she wants her off the hook and her brother punished for rightfully shunning the bigot? \n\nChild psychologists. Now. For all of them. NTA", "YTA if you think your son should be the one excluded. Why is there any consideration that daughter should be going? You have grounded her indefinitely but she can do this? She can go get nails done? You are NOT punishing her if you reward her bad behavior. You need to remember that her punishment is separate from appeasing your other kids. The son should not be punished for his twin\u2019s bad behavior. \n\nWill your 16 year be disappointed, yes!  Does that mean your 13 yr old girl should go to appease her? No. These kids need to understand consequences.", "I don\u2019t know how to judge because I would shut down the party over this. Your oldest daughter is essentially excusing homophobia. 13f hasn\u2019t shown any real remorse and still considers this an overreaction. Your daughters need to know this is bigoted hateful behavior. Hate speech is a crime. Hate crimes carry penalties. This isn\u2019t a small deal.", "I think you read this post in a completely different way than everybody else\u2026", "They are paying for it so they do get to decide. When she pays for it herself then she gets to decide. Who is charge, the 15 year old or the parents.", "They are paying for it so they do get a say. NTA", "Because people on this sub just want to assume the worst of everyone. So even though OP says that they\u2019re not going to reward homophobia, this commenter just acts like they are so they have an excuse to go off on them.\n\nIt\u2019s the same reason why every post where a parent (usually fathers but occasionally moms, especially if they\u2019re working) that doesn\u2019t explicitly lay out the exact division of chores and parenting responsibilities, is assumed to be a freeloader and deadbeat.", "NTA but your 13 year old daughter is highly manipulative and seems to like conflict. The bullying was problem #1; the manipulation to exclude her brother for being critical and holding her accountable is problem #2. She had a spa day and immediately blew it again, she should not be allowed to go to the party, the entire family needs to hold a hard line with her when it comes to consequences. If she can\u2019t function in a healthy way and control her behavior, then society will control her behavior - and girls like her tend to run into issues with law enforcement and/or the mental health system as they get older.\n\nYour two oldest daughters have an unhealthy relationship. One or both of them need help that supersedes what you can provide as a parent.\n\nAnd 16 year olds shouldn\u2019t be calling the shots in any family at any point, in any way, shape, or form. I\u2019d be considering canceling the party altogether.", "Why don't you just talk to your daughter about what she said and what she feels?\n\nWhat did she say, by the way?\n\nI have no conceptualization of what positive thing grounding someone indefinitely (I don't even know what that means) accomplishes in regards to her feelings and behavior toward other people with regard to their sexuality. Will you change her mind? Do you know what is on her mind?", "This. If the 16 yr. old doesn't want them both there because of the tension, fine. 13yr. old daughter is grounded anyway and as such she can't go to parties. Boom, done. \ud83d\udc81", "The 15 y/o is obviously in charge. The moment they let the 13 y/o get the mani-pedi 'because they didn't want this to impact the 15 y/o' was when the change occurred.\n\nWhen you drop a harsh punishment you need to follow through, even when it impacts others. Especially *because* it impacts others. You let the 15 y/o KNOW the 13 y/o screwed up by **letting** this impact her life. They may try shift the blame, but you're an adult, tell them 'this happened, this is the consequence'."]}
