As long as it's done professionally and he's not crossing any boundaries then it shouldn't be an issue.  However, what's unprofessional is him bringing his personal life to the office and putting you in a situation where you felt uncomfortable.\n\nIt reminds me of the chiro I used to go to when my kids were little.  He gave me \"literature\" on why I shouldn't vaccinate my kids (we're talking basic vaccinations).  I thought it was totally unprofessional and inappropriate, given that he wasn't a medical doctor and he was giving out what I felt was false information.  I left his practice after that.\n\nI'm of the feeling that you should look out for another chiro to see.\n\nNTA", "He lies to his wife. Yuck.", "NTA wife needs to grow up.", "INFO:  No idea what you are talking about, can anyone help me out?", "NTA. There is nothing sexual about it. It's simply the most effective way to do it. My chiropractor does something similar.", "NTA \n\nBut something about all that gave me the creeps and if I were you and you insist on seeing a chiropractor I'd reccomend finding a new one ASAP. That was all so unprofessional!", "\" we are somewhat close \" - so the work field isn't being kept professional for starters. If it's all medical, he's nothing more than a provider and it should stay that way. \n\nAlso, he's now lying to his wife about doing the procedure on only men. Clearly it's an issue and if she finds out, and realizes how close you two are it might strike a whole can of drama. \n\nYou're NTA because this is on him but I would consider finding a new provider for these services. He sounds pretty gross if he can't even be honest with his wife.", "I agree. If his wife has a problem with what he does with his patients, that should remain between them. Why on earth would he tell OP about it?", "We have a very casual relationship, so that\u2019s not an uncommon type of comment for him to make", "Yeah, why\u2026.? I go to the chiropractor twice a month at least, he adjusts me with a sweatshirt on. Why on EARTH would he need to see your naked ass??? He has no reason for you to undress!! He\u2019s creepy and you sound naive. If you want a massage, go to a masseuse! And yeah if you like the fist thing so much (sounds like it\u2019s on your chest or he\u2019s grabbing you in an inappropriate way?) get a lacrosse ball, girl.\n\nEdit: I realized later he was doing some form of acupuncture, hence the naked body parts. But still.", "Yep he\u2019s bringing up his marital problems to gauge if op is interested", "Yeah, it sounds kinda like he is feeling you out and hinting that he is cool with lying to his wife.  It would make me super uncomfortable.", "My chiro does the same adjustment on me.  I like it better than the face down position, because I have fairly large boobs.  I can't get into the correct position to be adjusted because my boobs place my spine at an awkward angle.", "What sex acts exactly? And what was he doing that was coercive?? OP is imagining all of this because she has a crush on her chiropractor.  I way he said anything like to her. Honey, you need to get yourself a new chiropractor, leave this dude alone before you fuck up his marriage and career for nothing other than what is your head.", "It's kind of like a hug. The chiro will hold the patient's chest pretty close to their own and reach around to their spine. Not inherently a problem but yeah, the conversation about it gives me major creep vibes.", "This caught me off guard and I let out the ugliest sounding laugh lol. Ty.", "Agreed. When I read it, I got the vibe that chiro and wife never had any such conversation and chiro is getting off on imagining his wife being jealous and pushing boundaries with a patient, possibly with the intent to see if he can start an affair with a patient.", "this.", "This.\n\nStop paying for quackery and find an actual phisical therapist.", "We are decently friendly so it\u2019s a weird balance. I didn\u2019t know if he was trying to get me to tell him to stop, which in that case maybe I was the asshole. But he also offered to do the same adjustment where he picks me up, which is even more contact. It was weird.", "Agreed- it\u2019s so effective! I don\u2019t get what is wrong about it, which made it all weirder", "I mean it\u2019s entirely your call, but his wife sexualised a clinical procedure and he decided to share that with you, a patient. That would make me ask some questions.", "The problem is that he lied to his wife about you. Now that isn\u2019t your problem, but it\u2019s a problem that involves you whether you like it or not and if his wife and/or he are starting to read anything non medical into his care then I would consider if that made you uncomfortable. \n\nIf my chiropractor lied to his wife about me I\u2019d be super uncomfortable even though my adjustment occurs in a giant room with 10 other patients and 8 other chiropractors simultaneously.", "Chiropractors are NOT real doctors. They are snake oil salesmen and regularly cause more damage than they help with.\n\nRESEARCH what chiropractors have done to patients and stop seeing one. Go to a physical therapist if you need one", "it not being uncommon makes it worse. two problems: 1 he\u2019s married. his wife? would not appreciate those comments. 2 he is your chiropractor. he is supposed to provide a medical service and putting you in a vulnerable position while he does it. his boss, his other patients\u2026 you think they\u2019re okay with this kind of behaviour? his behaviour is so incredibly unprofessional i wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it cost him his job. it sounds like he is trying to get it in tbqh.\n\n(and i know this wasn\u2019t your question, but chiropractors are mostly fake. you can get the same results from a massage therapist, better results from a physical therapist, and both of those have lower health risks than seeing a chiropractor.)", "I've worked at a chiro clinic and share your attitude that paramedical treatments like this are completely sexless. But him bringing that up in that way feels more to me like taking your temperature to see if you wanted to get flirty. Physios/chiros/massage therapists can be a lot more casual than an MD but the good ones still have ethical principles that would preclude conversations like this.", "What am I imagining? I\u2019ve said nothing that would suggest I have a crush on my healthcare provider. If you don\u2019t have actually advice, I\u2019m not sure what your goal is here", "That as well as the fact that she had to decline more than once for him to do the acupuncture on her ass.", "Oh my guy does that to me pretty often. It is definitely NOT a sexy maneuver.", "Thought the same, basically like he was saying, I'm willing to lie to my wife for you. Ick", "Its weird for me I would be thinking about his comment every time i got that adjustment. This from someone who visited chiropractor for many years.", "sounds like he wants to be able to say he has stopped doing that one adjustment.\n\nAnyway he's got some boundary issues, he can't just tell his wife \"this is my *job*\".\n\nAnd it's affecting your professional relationship.", "Exactly. His marital problems are none of any of his patients business.", "It's not like he's an actual medical professional, not suprising he doesn't realise clinical boundaries.", "So he puts his fist on your breasts and your are totally naked?  I am not getting it.", "Absolutely not. All of that is wrong. It\u2019s completely clothed and his hand is on my back.", "OK, that is not an issue at all then.  What do you mean by your naked ass?", "For dry needling, a separate procedure. If it\u2019s done on glutes/hips, it requires exposing the skin in that area"]}
