Instead of shutting the discussion down, you should try to get to the bottom of why this is an issue for your wife now. \n\nI'm guessing that this started out with your MIL feeling overwhelmed by all the difficult paperwork that comes after death and realizing that her daughter will have an even more difficult time if the house she lives in isn't in her name too. For example, let's say she would inherit the house automatically if you die, which would probably be true if you don't have kids from your first marriage. Even then, she would have a hard time selling it until it's officially in her name, and she might not want or be able to afford to live in a big house without you in the meantime. If you have kids from your prior marriage, the house could become a legal battle or she could lose her place to live in on top of an already devastating situation (losing you). \n\nMy guess is that she assumed this was an oversight and that you wouldn't have a problem adding her, but now (thanks to your reasoning) it is starting to seem like a symbol of you not fully committing to your relationship, since you are protecting your assets against the idea of divorcing HER. \n\nDo you fully trust her? Do you see your marriage as lasting until death? If you do, you don't necessarily need to put your assets in her name, but you need to help her see that you trust her and demonstrate this care by taking her needs seriously. For example, make sure you have life insurance with her as the beneficiary, and make sure she has protected assets too. If this has dredged up really serious trust issues for either of you, I recommend couples therapy-- it can really help. \n\nGood luck!

This must be a difficult time for you all. \n\nNot sure what country you're in (I'm in the UK) so I suspect this conversation has arisen as a result of inheritance tax laws. \n\nIn the UK, if you own a property with someone else you can either be 'joint tenants (owners)' or 'tenants (owners) in common'. In the former case, if you were to pass, the other owner would inherit the property but the value of the property would not count towards the inheritance tax allowance. In the latter case, another owner could still inherit, but the value of the house would count towards the inheritance tax allowance. This can make the difference between whether inheritors have to pay inheritance tax at all. \n\nAssuming you want your wife to inherit the house after your death, making her a 'joint owner' of the house would be good from a tax perspective. However, if you want someone else to inherit your property, it doesn't matter at all. \n\nI appreciate that this looks like you wife and MIL are just meddling in your business but I think they are just trying to be practical and/or possibly trying to avoid a repeat of a situation that they may currently be in, depending on how your MIL/FIL's house was registered. It's natural for people who are grieving to want to find something - anything - that they can control, because they feel so out of control after the death. \n\nGiving that everyone is grieving, I'd strongly suggest saying that you all need to focus on FIL's passing right now and that it the situation can be revisited down the line.

It happens all the time. Or even kill him, that happens too.\n\nThere's not enough therapy in the world to give someone the opportunity to destroy my life like that. \n\nAnd thats what trust is: you let yourself be in a vulnerable position where the other party can take advantage of you.\n\nI think OP mentioned he's been hurt before, so he's just playing it safe. I dont blame him - but I wouldn't even get married in the first place.. and definitely not a second time, like OP. \n\nHe can't have it both ways.. which is why he's conflicted right now. He wants the safety and assurance that comes with not being married - while being married. \n\nSo he's either gotta gamble on that this woman is trustworthy, and give her the opportunity to destroy his life... or keep her at an arms length and let the relationship crumble (from either the lack of trust, or the lack of opportunity for her - if she's out to \"get\" him).", "Only if that is in your husband\u2019s will.

She\u2019s raising two (or at least 1.5) of *his* kids as well as her own - the amount of free childcare and domestic work she does for him should offset the financial input he makes day to day, especially if the house is in his name so it\u2019s his asset he\u2019s paying for instead of rent in the long term, and he\u2019s really only supporting her for food and bills.\n\nAnd he\u2019s said in a comment that he hasn\u2019t bothered to make a will to protect her (or their child(ren)) in the event of his death.

The daughter had to get a lawyer to do the quit claim deed so the house did revert to her (which I had to hound her to do).\n\nThe will alone doesn't change ownership.
