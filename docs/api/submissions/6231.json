Instead of shutting the discussion down, you should try to get to the bottom of why this is an issue for your wife now. \n\nI'm guessing that this started out with your MIL feeling overwhelmed by all the difficult paperwork that comes after death and realizing that her daughter will have an even more difficult time if the house she lives in isn't in her name too. For example, let's say she would inherit the house automatically if you die, which would probably be true if you don't have kids from your first marriage. Even then, she would have a hard time selling it until it's officially in her name, and she might not want or be able to afford to live in a big house without you in the meantime. If you have kids from your prior marriage, the house could become a legal battle or she could lose her place to live in on top of an already devastating situation (losing you). \n\nMy guess is that she assumed this was an oversight and that you wouldn't have a problem adding her, but now (thanks to your reasoning) it is starting to seem like a symbol of you not fully committing to your relationship, since you are protecting your assets against the idea of divorcing HER. \n\nDo you fully trust her? Do you see your marriage as lasting until death? If you do, you don't necessarily need to put your assets in her name, but you need to help her see that you trust her and demonstrate this care by taking her needs seriously. For example, make sure you have life insurance with her as the beneficiary, and make sure she has protected assets too. If this has dredged up really serious trust issues for either of you, I recommend couples therapy-- it can really help. \n\nGood luck!

This will help you both get your assets organized and give you both peace of mind for the future that your wishes will be followed.\n\nDon't let this be something to argue over.

This must be a difficult time for you all. \n\nNot sure what country you're in (I'm in the UK) so I suspect this conversation has arisen as a result of inheritance tax laws. \n\nIn the UK, if you own a property with someone else you can either be 'joint tenants (owners)' or 'tenants (owners) in common'. In the former case, if you were to pass, the other owner would inherit the property but the value of the property would not count towards the inheritance tax allowance. In the latter case, another owner could still inherit, but the value of the house would count towards the inheritance tax allowance. This can make the difference between whether inheritors have to pay inheritance tax at all. \n\nAssuming you want your wife to inherit the house after your death, making her a 'joint owner' of the house would be good from a tax perspective. However, if you want someone else to inherit your property, it doesn't matter at all. \n\nI appreciate that this looks like you wife and MIL are just meddling in your business but I think they are just trying to be practical and/or possibly trying to avoid a repeat of a situation that they may currently be in, depending on how your MIL/FIL's house was registered. It's natural for people who are grieving to want to find something - anything - that they can control, because they feel so out of control after the death. \n\nGiving that everyone is grieving, I'd strongly suggest saying that you all need to focus on FIL's passing right now and that it the situation can be revisited down the line.
