You are 9+ months pregnant.  I'd go check into a hotel near the hospital and be done with these people.", "NTA.  First of all, no medical professional would diagnose any type of infertility for a person who hasn't, you know, tried to get pregnant on purpose and because they felt an odd sensation in their abdomen during a time of emotional duress.  She more likely has displaced grief over the breakup and someone needs to say that.  Secondly, evicting the baby is a common joke.  Pregnancy is uncomfortable in the late stages and being grateful for something does not require denying reality.  Third, who in the hell wouldn't give someone five days past due a pass on the dishes now and then?  Pregnancy isn't a free pass to do nothing for forty weeks, but when you're past the due date, you should have some grace on household chores.  Fourth, being a parent requires sensitivity, empathy, the ability to selectively tell painful truths, and the ability to just shut down some forms of foolishness.  Lastly, your husband has lost his damn mind and should be doing 'your' part of kitchen cleanup.", "NTA.\n\n1) Your SIL is a drama queen.\n\n2) Your MIL is enabling that mess.\n\n3) Your hubby is spineless and should have stood up for you.\n\nI'd check myself into a hotel near the hospital until I was ready, and I'd tell hubby if he wants to go with he owes YOU an apology.", "NTA.  You SIL has a mental issue not \"emotional infertility\". That does not mean your comments did not hurt her. Most likely they did. however, you can not be walking on eggshells all the time. Your husband should have your back and his behavior i the most concerning.  I would move back to your place and tell your MIL and SIL that they can see the baby when they apologize to you.", "NTA! And your husband is so out of line for not supporting you. And you SIL is in a mental state that should be handled with therapy. I'm not a doctor but I was a medic in the Navy, worked in the neonatal ICU, and I was a psychology major in undergrad. Yeah, the human body can do some weird things in response to psychological conditions but there is no such thing as \"emotional infertility\" and your in-laws should be encouraging her to seek therapy if she really believes this, not enabling these beliefs and behaviors.", "NTA. They are very much AH. You should help clean up at 10 months pregnant? Really,  that\u2019s shitty. And what on earth is kookie SIL talking about? She\u2019s currently single so why would infertility even be a topic? She\u2019s not actively trying to get pregnant. You guys need to just go home and deal with what that entails.

Because I\u2019m pretty sure you don\u2019t feel being infertile. Are there any doctors on here? Also, the guy who left her dodged a big one. You will be a great mother.

You did not make your SIL cry \u2014 she made herself cry because of a nonexistent condition she just made up.

Her theatrics upset you, already overdue and uncomfortable, and you needed to lie down. What your MIL piled on you is cruel and nasty.

There was nothing wrong with your comment. I felt the same way when I was pregnant. Your SIL's situation is heartbreaking. I can't imagine the devastation of being left at the alter, but that was not YOUR fault. She obviously needs a lot of support and healing. I hope she's getting therapy because it sounds like she needs it. Go home and let the in-laws visit when the baby is born. Offer for SIL to come, too, but that may be more than she can handle. Tell your spouse that you are the one he needs to support right now. Pregnancy and child rearing isn't for sissies. He needs to have your back.", "NTA but sadly your husband and his family are.

I hope this isn't a habit of his, letting his family bully you into submission to \"keep the peace\". He is emasculating himself and it's sad to see, hope he steps up before he effectively ruins what respect you have left for him. The fact that he would let his mommy and sister make you feel like shit for not letting them insult you and degrade you over a regular/ not even controversial joke, is joke within itself. I wouldn't stay there for my own sanity", "Please pack your bags and leave these insane people and this includes your husband.

His mother is threatening to kick you out and he's agreeing with her?! I'd be packing up and finding a hotel or going home tomorrow.

Also, you, the heavily pregnant guest should not be helping clear the table, etc. Your husband can do 'your part'.\n\nSIL is mentally ill, at best, for diagnosing herself with something she's in no way qualified to do.

The poor woman needs to go into therapy, not be projecting on everybody else. \n\nI'd tell them SIL needs to get help before she can see the baby and you'll be awaiting her and MIL's apologies also. I'm usually all for communication over conflict, but they're not being reasonable. Good luck OP!", "NTA. Call a friend and go home.  Go home!

I would just go home, farther away from the hospital be damned.", "Yikes NTA. Go home or to a hotel close to the hospital.

He needs to have your back and he needs to apologize for not doing so from the jump.", "Nta your inlaws and husband are ah", "So go home.", "NTA. It sounds like you need to remind your husband that he has a new family to stand by. You are overdue and will give birth to his child. What happened to his sister is tragic, but it's not about her right now. It's time to show them and your husband you will not tolerate disrespect. If you need to leave and temporarily raise the baby until he gets it, then do it. You need a supportive husband right now, and it's not right his sister is taking priority during your time of need.", "A successful parent not only tries to understand their child, but also works to make sure their child is successful and healthy.

She clearly likes you. \nYou bite back (under literal and metaphorical heavy pregnancy stress) to a frankly ridiculous outburst from the SIL ... and you're threatened with eviction?! In your condition??\n\nThis seems wildly OTT from MIL. I say this gently, but are there any details you've omitted?", "Nta go home or.go to the hospital but do n't stay in the house. Your husband can help clear up.", "NTA- your MIL is pandering to the person who will make her life miserable if she doesn\u2019t support her. It\u2019s a huge red flag. I see the future being \u2018your a bad mother and my daughter needs to be the centre of attention.\u2019\n\nGet out now and go home.", "NTA...I'd go home and tell them to F off.  \n\nSIL is a wackadoo...no wonder she was left at the altar.  I bet there's more to that story then just being left.", "NTA", "NTA. Leave and no one sees your baby until they resolve their mental health issues. I would ask your doctor about emotional infertility and provide documentation to your MIL.", "Uhhhh why isn't your husband backing you up on this???? NTA you're overdue and it must be a struggle, I think everyone else could use some empathy and realize the stress they are putting on you for a situation that you did nothing wrong over and now they're already calling you a bad mum. What the actual??", "Your SIL attacked you and insulted you for no apparent reason, although her fictional condition of emotional infertility does suggest a psychological problem that could account for her bizarre hostility.\n\nYou refused to listen to any more vituperative crap and went up to bed rather than helping to clear up (at 9 months, 5 days pregnant!).  \n\nNow, your MIL wants you to apologize to one and all or be kicked out.  And your husband agrees with her????\n\nA husband who sits there while his pregnant wife is being attacked and then wants his wife to apologize is the biggest A in this whole scenario.\n\nLet your husband know that there will be no apology, that his sister's behavior was unacceptable, that his mother's reaction is vile, and that his support of his mother's position leads you to question his judgement, his maturity, and his loyalty to you.\n\nThen get a hotel room.  Take your go bag and organize how you'll get to the hospital when the time comes. Hopefully, husband will be in that hotel room with you, very penitent.  But either way, you've got this.\n\nPeople who pressure people who are, in fact, the victims, to apologize to keep the peace or salve the feelings of the offenders are, in my opinion, moral weaklings.  You did nothing wrong, and should not apologize.\n\nMake a dignified exit.  Explain that you won't be back, and neither will baby, until SIL apologizes to you for her unprovoked attacks and insults, and MIL apologizes for trying to manipulate you to apologize with a cruel threat on the eve of the birth of your child.\n\nYou and your husband can hash out how you're going to handle his very serious lapse later.  Just be very firm now, hold your ground, and get out of that toxic, toxic house right away.\n\nNTA\n\nP.S. Before someone jumps me for the emotional infertility comment, yes, of course stress can undermine the ability to achieve a wanted pregnancy, but the notion that SIL knows her womb \"broke\" when she was traumatically left at the alter so now she knows she can't conceive is, ummm, can we go with balderdash? And I really hope it doesn't lead her to forego birth control if she's sexually active & doesn't choose to conceive.", "NTA your husband has some REAL f@&king nerve landing on these gross peoples side on this. He has categorically failed you as a partner. But there\u2019s no time to focus on that. Please get out. Get out and never let the in-laws near you and your child again. To cause this stress at this literal birthing juncture. F@&k all of them, and him, get away from these people and please know you are going to get through this, and you will be Ana amazing mum. This garbage people, husband included, can all eat dirt.", "NTA. \n\n1. I could never imagine even thinking about asking a pregnant overdue person to help with chores. \n\n2. I have empathy for your SIL and get why she is upset but that is not your problem, she was still extremely out of line and should seek professionell help since she seems to be having huge mental problems. Also, emotional infertility is not a thing. MIL is also was out of line and inappropriate for even suggesting you should apologize to her and SIL\n\n3. the actual and biggest problem though is your husband not having your back. For me personally this would be the hill I would die on. \n\nI\u2018m sorry you\u2019re having to deal with all this right now. Wishing you all the best for the birth and resolving things.", "NTA. Your response was to remove yourself from unnecessary conflict created by SIL. Your MIL and SIL then escalated even further. Leave for a hotel and be happy. \n\nYour husband also needs to rethink his priorities. She is within rights to kick you out. In that, he is right. But he should be arranging a hotel and sticking up for you. I would not want MIL or SIL at the hospital or there in the first few weeks causing stress.", "NTA. Jeez I always thought my family was whack but this sub really makes me realise how easy I had it... or perhaps it's general western society these days? I dunno. It's like family units somehow now only have several brain cells to share amongst themselves.\n\nYou've got a crappy husband.", "NTA, but kick yourself out.  SIL is delusional and needs help.  You did nothing wrong.  MIL is being ridiculous in her enabling of her daughter\u2019s mental state which isn\u2019t helping.", "Wtf is wrong with your in laws. You are overdue and these bastards want to play this game? NTA at all and I would gladly vacate and get myself a hotel close to the hospital", "Info : are you happy having a baby with a spineless husband ?", "No! NTA. Your husband and his family are all being jerks, and at the worst possible time. Ugh! I'm so sorry this is happening to you.\n\nAlso: \"What is that sinking feeling when you get bad news?  \nThat's cortisol, the stress hormone getting a burst in your blood stream. Increases your heart rate, helps the muscles fill up with extra glucose for energy, shuts down the digestion (not necessary for fight-or-flight stress response). The emergency shutdown of the digestion is the stomach sinking.\" \n\nThat's not \"emotional infertility\" or a \"womb breaking.\" It's a physiologic fight-or-flight response.", "NTA. If it's possible to move out -do it.", "Rifht. So sorry MIL. If you can have me in the house now, you can have my baby in the future. Grow up MIL.\n\n\nSIL is a wank.\n\nSorry, been in your situation . Set your boundaries  NOW! \n\nNTA", "Nta. Self diagnosed emotional infertility? I have never heard such bs. I can see why she was left at the alter though. But one thing op, after you have had the kid, and are stable - seriously? This guy? This family? This is what you want your kid to grow up in?", "I'm starting to wonder how you can let your husband and his family treat you this way! \n\nNTA in my opinion. \n\nShe was weird and you very clearly made a joke about the eviction which she used to portray you as a bad mother. That's just really mean. \n\nYour MIL and sadly your husband also suck for being on your sils side ...like wtf? And kicking a highly pregnant woman out because of that? Those people are not your family! Think about that. \n\nI know you are in a bad position right now because you can't really leave because of the pregnancy and birth but as soon as you are at home again with the baby i would have a serious talk with your husband!", "SIL has emotional problems and husband and MIL are enabling her. I would head home or head to the hospital for an induction.", "Others have already covered my thoughts around your in laws and husbands behaviour. I didn't see it in a skim read but I just wanted to say, please be careful around your in laws once baby is born. \n\nSee so many stories of people with \"infertility issues\" latching on to a child that isn't theirs and using the \"but I'm infertile you're not so you should give me this one and just have another\" or something like that and I worry your MIL would enable that. Hopefully your husband would stand up to that but do keep an eye out as he seems to be too focused on peacekeeping to stand up for what is right.", "Wtf? Your sister in law is insane and your mil isn\u2019t much better. NTA", "NTA\n\nWhat the hell? Your SIL was extremely rude to you!\n\nAny why are you expected to help round the house when you are way past due date? You should be resting. Your husband should be doing all this on your behalf - you are doing all the heavy lifting here.\n\nYour husband really needs to step up his game.\n\nJust get yourself a nice hotel nearby with room service - your husband can join you if his mother lets him.", "Sounds like you've married into a family of idiots and SIL needs professional help. It's scary that hubby and MIL are feeding into her madness too. OP definitely NTA.", "Oh Girl, so NOT the AH. Hubby is though. MIL got mad because you didn't help with the dishes when you're 9 months pregnant and overdue? That's WAY out there. I guess they thought gaining a DIL was gaining a servant and they're taking it hard that you're not. I truly am sad for you because now you're stuck with them and your unfeeling momma's boy. Sweetheart go home and tell them all to suck it. Hubby can come with or stay with Mommy.", "NTA. Go back home. Being closer to the hospital isn\u2019t worth all this toxic energy.", "NTA\nYour SIL remarks to you were unkind and hurtful. She owes you an apology.  You pretty much just removed yourself from her range. Your MIL demanding you do chores when overdue pregnant is weird. Although if you're up to it, helping clear away is good.\n\nThe worst is your husband siding with them. I wouldn't apologize and I would be headed for home. Your peace of mind is worth more than a shorter drive.\n\nUnless your doctor advises you live too far away, I wouldn't worry about the distance. Most first babies take their time. I live in a rural area and lived 50 minutes from the hospital. It was no problem.", "There are many A Hs here, but you\u2019re not one of them!\n\nSo your MIL invited a heavily pregnant woman to stay in her home\u2026and expected you to help with chores? HUH?? Was your husband expected to help??\n\nYour husband should have shut this down when his sister directed the first comment to you. His sister lacks any ability to understand your situation, having never carried a baby past it\u2019s expected date of arrival. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If my pregnant DIL was staying with me, she would be expected to sit on the sofa watch bad TV and relax and sleep.  I would be hiring someone to come in and give her a pedicure.  There is no way in this Gods green earth she would be doing dishes.", "NTA.", "NTA - girl get a hotel your husband and his family are crazy if they think that this is normal behaviour", "Just leave. Your SIL is a loon, your MIL is enabling her crazy, and your husband has a spinne made of limp noodles and is an absolute failure as a partner. You and your impending LO have better things in life to do.

Emotional infertility is 100% not real but psychiatric conditions are definitely real.\n\n\n2. Who the hell is making a whale of a pregnant woman wash dishes when her husband has 2 working hands?\n\n\n3. You de-escalated, which was appropriate. They are still escalating, which is emotionally immature. I doubt you can change their mind due to that.\n\n\n4. I am so sorry that you have married and been impregnated by such an AH husband who seems determined to break you until you are servile.", "Wow,mil would kick you out for expressing happiness and irritation at being 9 months pregnant? Then I think you need to find a new place, and quite possibly a new hubby too! Wow", "You are NTA\n\nif I were you I would pack my bags and head back home.

It can be hard enough managing simple personal care let alone doing housework. So no, you are NTA especially as it does not sound to me as if you were either rude or insensitive. Just being tired of waiting for the baby to make their move!\n\nYour husband and in laws, however, were insensitive and rude along with being TAs. If your husband can't support you at such a difficult time then goodness knows when he'll find a backbone.

You are about to give birth and while I am sure your presence in the house is hard for SIL, she still needs to be in therapy.\n\nI think your SIL would cry about anything.

Your MIL does have her hands full, but still\u2026\u2026.wow!   Can\u2019t have you in the house unless you make apologies?????  Bad move on Grandma\u2019s part.

I think it's best if we leave and if MIL and SIL do not see the baby until they have both sought counselling because the impact of SIL being jilted at the alter has evidently affected both their mental welfare. We'd be concerned about how the arrival of the baby could further trigger you and are hesitant to expose our newborn to such negative energy\". NTA", "Omg you have a huge problem- and the worst is that your husband thinks his family\u2019s behavior towards you is ok! Do you have your own family or support system you can stay with? I am truly worried for your own mental health in this situation. NTA", "NTA. Go home, OP, with or without your unsupportive husband. Personally, I would go NC with his mom and his crazy sister. They sound horrible, and you don't need people like that in your life.", "NTA. Go to a hotel near the hospital and let your MIL and SIL know they won't see the baby until they apologize. Do not apologize to them because they are being ridiculous. Your husband is spineless and weak.", "NTA\u2026MIl and SIL are though\u2026and WTF is your husband thinking?", "NTA, and your SIL is never going to get over being dumped if her parents keep coddling her every whim.  She felt her womb break?  geez.", "NTA. Quite frankly, your SIL (& probably your MIL) would've hated me when I was near the end of my pregnancy with my daughter. I was very uncomfortable & cranky, and I had lost any tolerance for even the mildest amount of BS. \n\nI was 42 weeks 3 days when she finally arrived on a Monday. The Friday before her birth, I had told my OB/GYN to either schedule my freaking induction or I was going to give myself a cesarean at home. Most likely not the smartest idea, but it finally got the desired results since the Dr scheduled my induction. A procedure that ended up not happening because I was finally in labor when I reached the hospital on the intended day.\n\nBack on topic, though, I had been joking about giving daughter her \"eviction\" notice since roughly a month before my due date. It was simply meant as a joke towards the tenancy laws in my area, which require a 30-day notice of intent to evict.", "I have actual, physical infertility and there's no way in hell I'd make that comment to a pregnant woman (especially for a very common joke!). SIL is completely out of line.", "*Soon after, my MIL came after me and said that she couldn't have me in the house unless I apologise to SIL for hurting her feelings,* \n\n**SIL took a normal pregnant mother's comment and turned to give herself attention.**  SIL's behavior was ridiculously over the top.  Is she mourning?  Sure.  But your condition is not about her.  Your situation isn't about her.  She should adult and respect you and if she can't, she should have quietly left the room, not used the excuse to hurt you and insult you.  ***You do not owe SIL any apology for being pregnant and occasionally commenting on your discomfort.***  \n\n*and I apologise to MIL for being a bad house guest and not helping.* \n\nYou are not being a bad guest.  **You do not owe MIL any apology.** That she's saying these things, she's trying to be in control over you before your child is born, and get you used to obeying her.  **This is not healthy behavior from your MIL.**    \n\nYou are a guest, not a renter.   You didn't help with chores, once, because you were insulted by SIL and no one stood up for you and called SIL out for being rude to you.  **You did the sensible thing and left the room.**  I guess MIL expects you to sit there and treat SIL with extreme favoritism, too.\n\nI thought the reason for you to be there was to be closer to the hospital, to have someone helping you?  **Seems like MIL thinks you are there to help her, not for her to help you.**\n\n*She said I need to be more understanding if I want to be a successful mother.* \n\nNonsense.   **Are your MIL and SIL trying to undermine your confidence so they can take control over you and your child?  If they aren't, they are surely acting like they are.**  For this reason alone, the several comments on how you can't be a good enough mother, in their minds, if you don't act exactly how they want you to, every second, that's reason enough to leave their house immediately.  They aren't having you there as a guest to help you.  They are doing this for some other reason.  \n\n**Do they expect you to come back there to stay after the child is born?  Don't.**  From just this much of their behavior, they are controlling, emotionally abusive to you, belittling you, undermining you, puffing themselves up as experts and you as not worthy.   If you stay there after your child is born, I suspect they will be swooping in and taking your child out of your sight constantly, and pretending it's to help you, when it's really to let them play mom.  \n\n*MIL said that I had until tomorrow's dinner to apologise and find a way to make it up to both her and SIL.*\n\nNTA.  \n\nPlease pack up and go to a hotel or back home.  The favoritism in that house isn't healthy for you.  It's a toxic environment.  You deserve better.\n\n*When my husband came up, I was telling him what MIL had said,* \n\nAnd, he, sensibly, packed up for you to rescue you from your MIL's horrible behavior? Right? \n\n*and he agreed with her and said she wouldn't be out of line for kicking us out.* \n\nWow.  **That family is very dysfunctional.  He is supposed to be caring for you here, not pandering to his sister and mother's selfishness.** \n\n*Now I am starting to wonder if I really am being an AH?*\n\nNTA.  Do you have any other people you can trust to stay with?   Friends?  Family?  Kind strangers?  Because this houseful of people seems to be bent on being emotionally abusive to you, dismissing your needs and making everything about SIL and MIL, even your discomfort at this stage.  \n\n**Normal people would be showing their concern for you, not blaming you and accusing you of these ridiculous things.**  ***That your husband cannot see how wrong this is, that's hugely concerning.***\n\nDo not apologize to these queen babies.  Leave.  If you need a ride, call someone to help you.  But leave this toxic house.  **No one there is making your care their priority.**  Go someplace safer for you.\n\nAnd later, when MIL demands you visit, tell her that she said you can't be there until you apologize and you aren't apologizing for being insulted and abused by them.  And that she's not welcome around you, or your child, because of her toxic and cruel behavior.", "Do you have a support system outside of this family? #1 what is wrong with your husband that he agrees that it is more than fine that his family kicks you out if you don't apologize for making a comment about how you feel.....and when you were attacked instead of lashing out you removed yourself.  #2 he doesn't feel that his sister and mom should apologize for telling you that you aren't fit to be a mother.  \n\nI would be VERY worried about these two things.  He is ok with you having no where to go...and ok with them telling you that you won't be a good mother.  Your SIL should have started therapy 7 months ago.  She is living in a dream world and making up conditions to become a perpetual victim.  I'm sure when she does get pregnant it will be a 'MIRACLE child'.  \n\nYou need to insist that both you and your husband go to marriage counseling because his behavior is NOT acceptable.  You did absolutely nothing wrong and was attacked for making a comment about yourself and then when you were attacked removed yourself from the situation rather than saying what could have been said.  You do need to leave not because they asked you to but because they are toxic for you right now when you need to not be under stress. Do you have a friend you could stay with? Somewhere you could go?  \n\nMark my words i would be concerned about mil and sil planning to find a reason for your husband to leave and take the little one with him.  It just seems super suspicious.  I've read too many reddit stories at this point to not be suspicious of this sudden attack and for two people in moments of each other questioning your ability to be a mother.", "I would say it is unfortunate that your feelings were hurt. It was not my intention to hurt you and I assure you I am very grateful for the opportunity to have this blessing. I am sad that such a horribly mean thing happened to you and since he won't apologize to you I will apologize for him. I hope you find peace. Then I would thank everyone for dinner and go back to my home and not live with them.", "> 3) Your hubby is spineless and should have stood up for you.\n> \n> \n\nAnd should have been the one doing chores around the house for that matter!  It is his parents house AND his wife is VERY pregnant at the moment.  What a deadbeat!", "Right it takes 6 months of trying and failing to get pregnant before they even start looking at infertility, and they normally won't make it official until after a year of not getting pregnant despite attempting to, unless they find a cause for it.  So unless she's been spending the last 7 months trolling hookup apps trying to have a baby to have someone to love her, there is no way she has been medically diagnosed with infertility.  And honestly that woman is not in a sound state of mind to be hoping on that hormone rollercoaster.", "Yeah... OP, I'd start packing. Even if just to stay at a hotel nearby. You can say you understand that MIL doesn't want you in her house due to hurting her mentally unstable child's feelings, so you're going. With how unstable your SIL is, you just don't think it's good for her to be around a pregnant woman at all. \n\nI wouldn't have them visit you in the hospital, at home, or at the hotel, if you stay there. I'd just tell your husband that it seems you all need space. I'd also say you think that, given his sister's emotional state, you should keep the baby far from her. f she's that unstable, the baby isn't safe around her. Your husband can send them pictures while you focus on the baby.\n\nAlso, I'd speak to your husband privately about supporting his sister and mom over his pregnant wife...", "NTA.\n\n>I would move back to your place and tell your MIL and SIL that they can see the baby when they apologize to you.\n\nCorrect.  Bit of a husband problem however.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You\u2019re 5 days over due and mil expects you to clean up after dinner and to apologize to her emotionally stunned psychotic daughter who got left at the alter for A DAMN REASON! We clearly know nothing about why she was left at the alter but if this is what she\u2019s like to family, she\u2019s gotta be ten times worse to anyone that has the displeasure of being intimate with her! \n\nIf she is emotionally infertile, that\u2019s good! She\u2019s too unhinged to become a parent, but we know emotionally infertility is a fucking joke so when the psycho does get pregnant eventually, be sure to hold this nonsense over her head. \n\nJesus Christ, your husband a spineless coward. I want to say SOOOO much more about him but that\u2019s the man who\u2019s baby you\u2019re about to have so I\u2019ll let you cope with that how you need to. \n\nIf you have family and friends near by, lean on them and lean as far away as you can from his family!

You don\u2019t matter to them their son and their grandchild matter, you\u2019re just the incubator to these people. \n\nIf you don\u2019t put distance between them and you they will ruin your early motherhood experience, they might even be the sole cause of your postpartum depression if you do get it. Please be selfish and get the fuck out of there!!!!!!!!", "Right?!! If anything, hubby should be helping with the after dinner dishes. Not agreeing with his enabling mother and attention seeking sister.\n\nI mean, this woman literally made up that she is infertile because she \"felt her womb break\" because some guy ditched her (yes, it's super traumatic to be left at the alter but you can't just *say* you're infertile because of it).\n\nYou know how many women joke about wanting to get the baby out near the end?? It's super common because of how uncomfortable it can be at the end. And, you do get impatient to meet your baby.\n\nI'd apologize for hurting her feelings (even though I still think SIL is wallowing in victimhood when she doesn't know if she is infertile) but OP has feelings too and she's allowed to say she can't wait for the baby to get here", "My thoughts exactly. My 8 months pregnant SIL hasn't lifted a finger in our house since she told us she was pregnant at 2 months. At the beginning she still forced her help on us but now she is so grateful that she can just relax when she visits.", "Probably because SIL gets attention and sympathy because of it", "She certainly is playing the victim card, though", "True, didn't say anything else or tried(stupid neurdivergence and words) . But I agreed that OP is not here and that SIL nedds to have a reality check and get some help."]}
