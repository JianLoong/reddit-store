No. \n\nShould you? Maybe a little to help. \n\nThe landlord will only be lenient for so long. The other creditors won't be lenient at all. \n\nWhile she clearly made bad choices, it sounds like most of the reason she's struggling so much is because one of her children is special needs, which can be very expensive. \n\nMaybe offer a small monthly amount (for a set period of time) for emergency caregivers, so the child can be taken care of in a smaller emergency without her having to miss work.
