She's drowning in debt (mostly medical bills for special needs child) and got fired from multiple jobs due to having to always call out due to her special needs child having some medical emergency, she's months behind on rent but landlord hasn't evicted her bc he feels sorry for her. \n\nMy husband (42m) and I are child free by choice, while we aren't Vanderbilt's by any stretch we do have a comfortable lifestyle. We were going to use my portion of the inheritance for a down payment on a house (we live in an apartment albeit a nice one) and to treat ourselves to a nice vacation in Europe (I've never been there but DH has and I've always wanted to go). \n\nMy sister's portion of the inheritance will cover some of her debt (she wants to pay off creditors first bc they're threatening to take her to court while the landlord is showing more leniency), but my family is saying I should give her my share of the inheritance because that would cover almost all her debt (she wasn't spending frivolously it was mostly the mounting medical bills for my special needs nephew), and it's \"more important\" than a house because we're \"fine in our apartment\" and this is \"more urgent.\"\n\nIm no prude or slut shamer but bottom line is my sister was wreckless in having unprotected sex with multiple men and getting pregnant by three separate ones who for various reasons can't/don't help and that's not my fault, I don't feel my husband and I should have to sacrifice our dream of being homeowners (which is incredibly hard to do these days) and having to sacrifice this vacation I've always wanted to go on. I was responsible and think I made good choices and I don't think I should have to suffer consequences for her poor decisions.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: When I told my family I'm not responsible for her reckless life choices, they agree that she didn't make good decisions but \"the children are innocent\" I agree but that's still not my fault nor my problem\n\nEDIT: I also reminded them she could get pregnant again any time, because she still young and she \"doesn't believe in abortion.\" Even if I did give it will never be enough\n\nEDIT: For those accusing me of slut shaming, I could care less what consenting adults do behind closed doors. Hell I worked as an exotic dancer to put myself through grad school. My issue is her carelessness with BC (she's admitted to using the \"pull out\" method bc her partners didn't like condoms and she was afraid he'd break up with her, this was with the one in jail and the deadbeat, not sure of the circumstances with the Vegas one night stand), and she doesn't like hormonal birth control due to them making her gain weight (she gained a lot more with pregnancy but okay). I've brought up voluntary sterilization (which I got done ) which planned parenthood will do for free but she won't because she's \"afraid she'll regret it later,\" and she \"loves babies\" and as I said earlier she doesn't believe in abortion. \n\nI don't care under what circumstances consenting adults have sex, but its not okay to come to me with your hand out when you can't afford the consequences of your choices. As one poster said, I'm not slut shaming, I'm stupidity shaming and won't deny it. \n\nAnd I've helped her out before but it never seems to stop. At what point does it end? When do I get to fulfill my dreams? Or do I forever have to flush my dreams down the toilet to keep bailing my sister out of trouble?", "created_utc": 1669164045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2ag5t/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_whos_a_single_mom/", "score": 3323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This ADULT has unprotected sex with every guy she dates!!! Those are her consequences to deal with not yours!", "NTA - tell your relatives that your collecting money on your sisters behalf and how much are they contributing?", "Well, she should be judged, as her shitty decisions ruined the life of \"the poor innocent children\" people keep reminding OP about.", "Toxic for stating facts?", "I like the I will match whatever anyone else is willing to give. Put up or shut up.", "You wouldn\u2019t believe the number of white moms I\u2019ve met that get it and still call other people trashy for doing it.", "Nobody is ever truly prepared for that possibility, whether a pregnancy is planned or not.\n\nI think many commenters have no idea how ableist they're being, but that's a discussion for a more nuanced subreddit.", "Explain how special needs is her fault.", "Its bad to judge people for consistent terrible decisions now?", "Nooooooooooooooooooooooo the consequences of my actions! Who will think of the poor innocent children!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer shitty choices got her to where she needs OP's money to survive. As a mom of 3, it's time to learn some responsibility. Oh, and the family can always foot the bill, instead of throwing a pity-party for her kife."]}
