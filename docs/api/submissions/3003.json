No. \n\nShould you? Maybe a little to help. \n\nThe landlord will only be lenient for so long. The other creditors won't be lenient at all. \n\nWhile she clearly made bad choices, it sounds like most of the reason she's struggling so much is because one of her children is special needs, which can be very expensive. \n\nMaybe offer a small monthly amount (for a set period of time) for emergency caregivers, so the child can be taken care of in a smaller emergency without her having to miss work.

Has she applied for SSI for the child?  \n\nIf a one-time payout from your inheritance should get her out of debt, shouldn't a bankruptcy filing do the same?", "> Im no prude or slut shamer but bottom line is my sister was wreckless in having unprotected sex with multiple men and getting pregnant by three separate ones\n\n>  Even if I did give it will never be enough\n\nI\u2019d argue that you are slut shaming her but you\u2019re still NTA. Your grandma gave you both money to use, if she wanted she could have given your sister a larger share. \n\nShe has a hard life but that doesn\u2019t mean that you need to give up all dreams and pleasures in order to financially help her. This is one instance, but are you supposed to give up all vacations, cars, etc to give her money?", "NTA.  Your sister would be better off declaring bankruptcy and using her portion of the inheritance to settle her debts, instead of trying to pay them off in full.  She doesn't need or require your share to do that.", "NTA. If you feel guilty leave a bit to your neices and nephews when you pass. Your mess of a sister will burn through more just as fast. It won't help anything.", "NTA.  This is what Medicaid is for. She should be eligible to get at least her kids on it.", "NTA. they can support her if they\u2019re so worried about it", "NTA\nYou absolutely do not owe it to your sister to give her your half, but, please, please tell her to negotiate payment of her debts and not just put what she has on them. Especially if the debt has changed hands and a different creditor owns it now. \n\nCreditors like that want to make a fast buck and may be willing to discharge all of the debt in return for a partial lump sum payment (after all, they didn't pay the full amount to purchase the debt). She needs to be very careful to not tell them how much money she is getting or they will, of course, want all of it. She could imply (not lie) that the money is coming from someone else, which is why she can't pay it all. Start low-ish, try to get them to list a number they'd be happy with first, and negotiate for a lower number than that. \"A relative might be able to help me pay this. If I can come up with a lump sum payment, how much would you need to discharge this debt.\" \"I don't think I can get that much, how about x.\" \"Oh, no, I could never ask for that much from my relative. How about x.\" Note how all of the example phrases are not a lie about what her real financial state is, but give her a third disapproving partner who can be tougher than her? That's the goal.\n\nLong shot here, but if she has any debt that she hasn't made a payment on in 7 years, it's possible it could no longer be a valid debt. She's will need to look into local laws for that. What matters is how long it has been since she last made a payment, not who owns the debt.\n\nShe also needs to start looking into charities that help special needs kids. I know once a kid gets on Shriners they will help that child until they are an adult. She may even be able to find a program that will have lawyers and accountants who can negotiate the repayments for her.\n\nEnjoy your new home, OP. Best of luck to you and your sister. F the current system that put her in so much debt just because her child has special needs.", "NTA- 1. You are not responsible for her mistakes, and 2. If your grandmother wanted her to have it all, she would have left it all to her.", "NTA.\n\nIf you want to help your sister... propose that everyone in the family donate the same amount to your sister. Let's see how big their generosity and sorriness for your sister is when their money is on the lines as well.", "NTA.

But why is the child that has accrued medical bills NOT on medicaid (I'm assuming you are in the USA).

Then close the app and delete the names of all those contacts.", "Your sister needs these kids on medicaid. Medical bills will be covered.", "NTA. That's the Hot Mess Express. Tell everyone who wants to give away YOUR money to pitch in and pay her bills. Im sure I will get roasted, but we reward bad/stupid behavior these days.

She can also fill out information with the hospital about getting the debut taken care of, we go to a religious hospital associated with a Catholic church because they will not charge us because of that and his medical card. If she does have that already she needs to look into changing the agency it is through. We did that with my son and again all doctors/emergency room/specialists all free. Oh and depending on the state and child's disability she can also apply to be a home health care taker. They will then pay her to be home with him.

You'll need the bigger house", "NTA you aren\u2019t responsible for her choices. \n\nOn a side note she should let the creditors go to court. You prioritize payments to ensure housing and food before bad debt, especially with children depending on you.", "NTA, your sister has been in debt awhile it appears. Where are your parents? What about grandma, why didn\u2019t she help when alive? This didn\u2019t happen overnight. Now your family is concerned? Get your house, enjoy your once in a lifetime trip.
