No. \n\nShould you? Maybe a little to help. \n\nThe landlord will only be lenient for so long. The other creditors won't be lenient at all. \n\nWhile she clearly made bad choices, it sounds like most of the reason she's struggling so much is because one of her children is special needs, which can be very expensive. \n\nMaybe offer a small monthly amount (for a set period of time) for emergency caregivers, so the child can be taken care of in a smaller emergency without her having to miss work.

She needs to be very careful to not tell them how much money she is getting or they will, of course, want all of it. She could imply (not lie) that the money is coming from someone else, which is why she can't pay it all. Start low-ish, try to get them to list a number they'd be happy with first, and negotiate for a lower number than that. \"A relative might be able to help me pay this. If I can come up with a lump sum payment, how much would you need to discharge this debt.\" \"I don't think I can get that much, how about x.\" \"Oh, no, I could never ask for that much from my relative. How about x.\" Note how all of the example phrases are not a lie about what her real financial state is, but give her a third disapproving partner who can be tougher than her?

So by upvoting you're helping that comment win!", "NTA Your family can mortgage/remortgage their own properties if it\u2019s so important someone bail out your sister", "I'm going to go with ESH because even if you gave sister the money, it woudln't solve her problems.  She would accrue more medical debt.  \n\nShe probably needs to file for bankruptcy.  It's a shame nobody advised her of this as an option so that her inheritance could be protected.  This would feel like a happier ending if she got rid of all the debt and had a down payment for her own home, instead of paying off half, filing bankruptcy, and walking away broke.  \n\nYour snide remarks about her reproductive choices make you an AH too, but my vote has nothing to do with the money.  Sometimes you need to bite your tongue and keep your thoughts to yourself.  No child needs to find out that their aunt, uncle, grandparents, or others in the extended family think they shouldn't have been born and regrets their existence.   There are plenty of reasons to refuse to share the money without slinging mud.  Isn't her life hard enough?", "Maybe the parents can volunteer their own money", "NTA. She's has 3 kids with 3 different men who do not support their own kids for various reasons. It sucks she struggling but you can not set yourself on fire to keep others warm.", "Bad decisions on her part do not constitute a problem on your part.\n\nNTA", "I'm confused as to why your family thinks it is your responsibility to bail her out. Stay strong! Don't do it.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not your fault or responsibility to cover the medical bills of HER child. Just because she has less than you doesn't mean you have to give her anything. I wouldn't give up dream of a house just because she couldn't use a condom.\n\nEdit: And I second if anyone keeps pushing you just tell them to give their own share to her if they think it's such a great idea.", "NTA. Your grandmother wanted you to have that money. If she\u2019d wanted your sister to have it, she\u2019d have given it to her. You\u2019re not responsible for her choices, and yes, \u201cthe children are innocent\u201d, but\u2026 so are you? Spend your money how you like.", "[removed]", "Not the asshole! Here comes a time in life where family becomes a statistic and you need to take care of yourself and significant other.  We all make decisions in life some good some bad but the fact remains is that you've made good ones and she's made bad ones, again a statistic. If there's one thing you come away from what I say she's a statistic. So are you, so am I, but you got to take care of you before you take care of anybody else.", "NTA, if you do want to help her, maybe help her get her special needs child on Medicare or Medicaid. If there are huge healthcare bills due to the special needs and your sister doesn't have much income there's a decent chance she'll qualify. \n\nAnd if your family is so worried about her, maybe they can take her and the kids in so she doesn't rack up more debt due to unpaid rent.", "NTA", "Confused why the family cant chip and cover her backdated rent and pay the landlord for a half a year  in advance to give her time. Pretty sure they could collectively do that.\n\nAlso its not about abortion but birth control.", "NTA. it's not your responsibility to take care of your sisters responsibilities. Would they expect you to cover her bills if you hadn't received the inheritance? Everyone makes choices and while it is not the children's fault there are programs near and far especially with the internet today to find agencies and organizations that are able to give her real help.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n**Don't give her a cent**, her inheritance is a massive privilege to undo some of her bad choices so why enable her by giving her even more?\n\nThe struggle is the only way she'll make better choices for those poor kids, let her hit rock bottom, inheritance of any kind is a massive massive privilege, she doesn't need even more.", "It's YOUR money though. Keep it  \nEurope is lovely. I suggest starting your trip in Prague. Have a lovely time\n\nOh and so reddit won't come for me - NTA", "NTA - its terrible that people who have children assume that the rest of us are somehow not entitled to anything unless approved by people with children, that you are selfishly happy because you made different choices in life.  \n\nThese other members of the family - are they giving her all their inheritance? Why havn't they chipped in over the years to cover her debt?  Is it because they think they are entitled to keep and enjoy their inheritance but you are less entitled to be happy because you havn't raised children?\n\nYou were given this money and buying a house is the very least you should do with it.  If you want to spend it on a world wide holiday - you are entitled to do that.\n\nIts unfortunate that this sibling has a difficult life but you joining her isn't the solution to any of her problems", "NTA \n\n> Even if I did give it will never be enough\n\nThat nails it. Why should you sacrifice a house to enable further mistakes and not actually fix anything anyway? She's already a flaming trainwreck, just still barely on the rails and heading for another collision at the next crossing. \n\n>  my family is ~~s~~paying\n\nAmended that for you :-) They can pay.", "NTA. You are absolutely right and if they\u2019re so concerned they can give her their money.", "NTA\nIf your grandmother wanted her to have it all, she would have given her everything.

Maybe because I have a great relationship with my sister I would give her part of my inheritance to help out. But like the frugal monster in me says \u2018 how is this going to stop her from accumulating more debt?\u2019 Like I hope people know that giving people money will not always help if they don\u2019t know how to move it. Indicator that she doesn\u2019t know what to do with money, is that all that she received went straight to debt, and not towards a lawyer that can help her get ssi for her kids. You should help your sister but not in a \u2018give her money\u2019 type of way.", "NTA, especially as it seems the money will not resolve the problem just prolong the current situation. If she can't afford her bloutgoings a one off payment doesn't amount to much.", "Nta, they're welcome to cover her debts if they feel that strongly about it.", "NTA. Did your parent get an inheritance from grandma?  Is parent helping their daughter with her debts?", "YTA. You are very judgmental of your sister and obviously want to show how much better you think your are to her. She\u2019s in debt because of a special needs child. The medical system in the US is awful and she\u2019s in debt because of it. \n\nBecause of medical bills and hospital bills, she\u2019s having trouble paying bills. She\u2019s not out partying, she\u2019s taking care of kids. \n\nYTA for your attitude.", "This is a lie. In the US, kids with disabilities are able to get on Medicaid and that covers medical bills.\n\nIf you do incur medical bills before Medicaid is in stated, they cover back bills too.\n\nAnd since OPs sister is clearly low-income, all of her kids will qualify for the state \"Kid Care\" (Florida's name) insurance.\n\nThis whole thing is straight trash.", ">but \"the children are innocent\"\n\nSo why doesnt the rest of the family pull money together to donate for her since they are all ready to help?", "Perhaps as they are so concerned your family can have a whip around and sort her debt for her. No? Didnt think so. Your sister is responsible for her children not you. She and their fathers but unfortunately she chose unwisely and this is the consequence. NTA.", "NTA.
