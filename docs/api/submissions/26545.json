I'm not trying to brag, but I don't know if it's worth mentioning. My friends and I grew up in a small town in England filled with poverty. Most of my friends work full-time but struggle to make ends meet; some have a family of their own now. I was the only one in the friendship group to go to university, and I now earn a comfortable salary where I won't have to worry financially. \n\nLooking back now, this should have been a red flag, but when I got there, my friends ordered loads of stuff, like meals with at least five sides each and many drinks. I was a bit flabbergasted as my friends were complaining they didn't have much money to spend, and some of my thoughts were it must have been payday as it was the start of the month. I ordered myself a cheese burger meal with an extra side of onion rings. Once I finished my dinner I asked if I could have the bill for my food. \n\nWhen the bill came I thought they got it wrong as it came to \u00a3870.00, and there were about eight or nine of us. I told the waiter there was a mistake as I had calculated my account, which totalled \u00a315.00. The waiter told me he was told to do it as one whole bill as I would pay in full. I told the waiter that's not happening and I said I only want to pay for the food I ate and I told him what I had. The waiter returned to the till and got a new bill printed which was my total; I paid and went home as I was irritated and pissed. \n\nMy friends are in a difficult position right now, but if they asked me two or three days in advance if I could pay the bill for all of them, I would have politely said yes as they would have asked, but they didn't. The next day, I woke up to some angry texts from our WhatsApp group chat. One of my friends in the group chat PM'd me and explained the situation. He managed to pay for his dinner but said an argument broke out in this group, and the manager got involved. Most of the bill was born, but they couldn't afford the rest and had to stay and clean for two hours. Most of the group are still pissed about the situation and me not paying the bill. \n\nI feel like I'm an asshole here because I didn't foot the bill and feel guilty due to the fact I found out they had to do cleaning and they're struggling with money now. \n\nAITA for this? I appreciate your judgement as part of me feels guilty but at the same time not guilty as they didn't ask me.", "created_utc": 1694298560, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16eivt4/aita_for_refusing_to_foot_the_restaurant_bill/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What yucky people.\n\nETA: oh, also the fact that they all started ordering an exorbitant amount of food and drinks indicates that they discussed this amongst themselves beforehand and agreed that you'd be covering the costs. The interesting thing is that they conveniently failed to mention this arrangement to the most critical person who they presumed would be footing the bill, ie. You. How did they expect this to go down? They probably thought that if they asked you in advance you'd say no, but if the bill was placed in front of you instead you'd find it hard to turn it down then and there and would just pay out of niceness.

I usually pick a mid cost entree. Maybe suggest sharing one or to apps. And I don\u2019t drink so no bar bill. And then maybe share a dessert if they want one. Even if I want a dessert, if they don\u2019t suggest it, I\u2019ll just eat something sweet at home. \n\nThey still should have asked if that was the plan, but even if they asked you, they were greedy & gluttonous.", "NTA.

What restaurant is letting people work off their bill?  They would call the police.", "NTA at all. They wanted to trick you into paying, but you were not letting them taking advantage of you. Congratulations for standing up for yourself this bravely.", "NTA, who does that to a friend? they tried to take advantage of you, put you on the spot hoping you'd just pay, they ordered a lot as you said, more than they could actually afford. don't pay in the future, even if they ask, you do it once, you'll be invited out more often, as long as you pay.", "Is this a real? Think the standard practice is to call the cops on bill Dodgers, don't know any restaurants that actually let you work it off. I mean for one they already have paid staff to do it so your friends would just be in the way and for another I don't think they would be covered by insurance and I doubt they would want to encourage this or everyone would do it. so yeah feels a bit off to me.\n\nIf it is real NTA, if not who cares ...", "NTA\n\nThey are all asshole for just assuming you will be willing to foot the entire bill without any discussion beforehand. Unless someone has specifically offered to cover the bill, you are paying for your own food.\n\nThey then firmly cement their position as asshole by not only expecting you to pay, but expecting you to be completely happy footing them spending to excess. When the person paying the bill is eating a modestly priced meal, good etiquette would be to aim for a similar ballpark unless told otherwise.\n\nSo yeah, your friends are asshole just out to take advantage of you, and deserve all of the consequences they experienced.", "Nta\n\n\ud83d\ude06 I picture them all wolfing down as much food as quickly as they could.

They invited you to dinner, and then they ordered the left side of the menu because they expected you to pay. These are not your friends!! Good riddance, you deserve better people in your life.

It's not about wanting you to pay, it's the assumption that you would pay and the attempt to use public pressure to comply that is the problem.\n\nI'm in a similar position to you. Lots of my friends and I came from low income families. They've gone into unfairly low income professions (think teaching and nursing) and have family and responsibilities, and I've gone into a specialist area where I appear to be working less but get paid significantly more. My friends *never* assume I will pay. I *almost* always do, but when they order they only order what they can afford. If they can't afford to have dinner? They tell me in advance and either I offer to pay, we organise a cheaper outing, or I bring over takeout and we have a movie night. They would *never* try to force me to pay.\n\nYou did the right thing. Giving in once will only make them think they can do it again. Even if you told them how upset you were or tried to make them pay you back, it would never work and they'd still do it next time. You've learned these people aren't your friends and it only cost you \u00a315. That's a saving of \u00a3855!
