I work 3 x 12 midnight shifts. I do all the cooking, lunch\u2019s for the kids, appointments, grocery shopping, meal planning, and on my days off cleaning, laundry. I wash my own clothes and my youngest child. \n\nToday when I arrived home after my 2 x 12 shift the kitchen was a mess. It usually is in some way. Now my partner helps out sometimes but leaves out the heavy chores like cleaning pots pans and leaves bowls of milk and wrappers and pop bottles for others to clean. \n\nWhen I\u2019m home he typically leaves the plates on the table after dinner for me to do or my oldest. So when I woke up and see all these dishes I was upset. I went to get my child from school and came home to clean it up. Then I went and got my other child from school to come home and cook. \n\nI spent no time with my kids I only cleaned and made dinner before I had to quickly shower and return to work. While I made dinner a created a short list of chores for everyone in the house to do on my days at work to help out and make me feel less like they could care less about me. \n\nThis enraged my partner to the point of him calling yelling at me and asking if this is a joke. He said I\u2019m being a dictator and that he won\u2019t follow any chores lists from anyone and I should appreciate the things he does do around the house. I do appreciate the things he does and I tell him that however it\u2019s not enough if Im not saying thank you like a lot.\n\n Here is the chores list I asked if him: \nempty the side of the sink that air drys, wash the pots and pans on my work days and make sure the kids do their chores on my work days. I literally do not think that\u2019s a lot to ask. I feel overwhelmed and exhausted. I care for people constantly at work and home. I just want some help and talking doesn\u2019t help anymore.\n\nSo AITA for creating a list for my family to help out?", "created_utc": 1676014862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yjetu/aita_for_creating_a_list_of_chores_for_my_husband/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Doing dishes is a basic adult responsibility, and it's even easier if you've got a dishwasher. It takes so little effort clean a few pans or put away clean dishes, that I don't even remember doing it in the evening. \n\nIdk his side of the story completely, but dishes are not a lot to ask. Neither is making sure the kids do their chores.", "NTA. I'm concerned that he YELLED at you for asking him to do the most basic of tasks for the betterment of the household. Even more crazy is that he's upset about doing it 3 days out of the week which isn't even a lot. Best of luck getting everything sorted out.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is capable of washing dishes, even pots and pans. He is deliberately not doing it because he knows if he refuses, you'll do it for him.\n\nStop cleaning his messes. Just stack up his dirty items and leave them on his desk. Don't do his laundry, don't cook for him, don't do his dishes. When he complains, tell him that since he does not want to do chores, you're helping by making sure that he doesn't dirty up a plate by eating your cooking. If he doesn't eat, the plate will remain clean, and he won't have the chore of washing dishes.

Sounds like 15 mins work tops and then making sure the kids do their chores. \n\nMassive red flag that he\u2019s saying you should be thankful for the bare minimum he does. You need to have a serious conversation with him because he\u2019s taking the piss.", "NTA. I'd actually consider a list helpful. It would give me an idea of what needs to be done. Although your list is what he should be doing anyway, without prompting.", "NTA  but I think a discussion about his disrespect of you is in order. If you make him a list without discussion like you did for your kids then you are treating him like a child rather than a partner, why is he not behaving like an equal partner in this relationship?", "NTA\n\nHe took on the additional responsibility and leave behind the bachelor lifestyle when he chose to get married and start a family.\n\nDon't be a glorified maid. Your husband needs to grow tf up.", "NTA, and this kind of disrespect would be grounds for divorce for me. That\u2019s not hyperbole. If both adults work full time, both adults split the household responsibilities. Period. If he can\u2019t do that, why have him around? He\u2019s more trouble than he\u2019s worth. He is not treating you like a partner- he\u2019s treating you like a maid.", "NTA\n\nIf he feels it's unreasonable he can do all the chores then and see how you feel.", "NTA at all. Not one little bit. \n\nThis just says to me that in addition to an unfair amount of household responsibilities, you've also just had to take on more of the mental load. Because he can't even take responsibility for working out the tasks that need to be completed.", "NTA.\n\nI think he objects to being treated like a child, but he wasn't doing it on his own volition either. If he doesn't like the list, he needs to come up with an alternative way to make sure he does them.", "The other day I sat my partner down and told him I need him to start contributing more with chores because the division of labour was extremely unfair. He apologised and said he would do better. Your husbands response to you asking for help is awful. You deserve better. NTA", "you are definitely NTA he should be able to take care of some chores and meet you half way!", "NTA\n\n\nI wonder if he appretiates what you are doing.", "NTA. He claims he does x amount for you yet, dishes are still being left in the morning and all. From now on, wash only what you have used and your kids have used, only do your kids laundry and your own. Once all of his piles up, he'll either realize he does need to help out more or he'll throw a fit again at which point, you stand your ground. You let it be known that the only reason that anything gets done is because of you and he needs to be an adult and do his part too, not just fixing things when they're broken or painting. That's stuff anyone can do with enough brain capacity and learning. He's outright refusing to do his part because you continue to pick up after him and he knows you will. Let his mess sit there until he chooses to pick up after himself. If he never does, he can go stay with family members and let you live in peace with your kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he lives there then he has to pitch in", "NTA. You shouldn't even have to make a list. He should just do what he can see with his own two eyes needs to be done.", "NTA- he\u2019s your partner and should be capable of seeing what needs to be done and just do it, but if he wants to behave like a child, then he can be treated like one.", "NTA\n\nThats is not a lot to ask AT ALL and the fact that he gets this angry with you for asking for help is incredibly worrying.\n\nHas he always been like this? Why have you been okay with being a maid in your own house for this long?\n\nHe does not appreciate what you do, he sees it as your job. Can i smell a little of misogyny with \"its a womans job to clean and cook\".\n\nId advice to sit him down and explain to him how much you keep the house running and still work long hours. But i have a feeling he wont listen due to the way he reacted to simply being asked to do TWO chores (making sure the kids do their share is barely a chore).\n\nIf he cannot see the effort, time and energy you put in to keep everything running, have him try. Go to your friends or parents home for a week. See how long it takes for him to call and yell about how he can't do it.\n\nI dont want to be one of those people that immediately say \"divorce\" but......was he always like this? Why did you marry and have kids with this man if he doesn't respect your efforts, and instead demands and thinks you owe him what you do every day?", "NTA\n\nOnce again a useless and lazy husband acting like a child and expecting his wife to be his mommy and clean up after him til death do you part. \n\nHonestly why do you even bother? Like what exactly do you get out of being married to a person who looks like a man but has the mentality of a 15 year old? It\u2019s just embarrassing and so pathetic I can\u2019t even comprehend it. It must be hard to even be attracted to him any more. He will never change, you are wasting yours and your kids time with this fool", "NTA. Your husband sounds like the human embodiment of weaponized incompetence at *best*. Blowing up at you on top of that is also concerning honestly. He sounds lazy and unreasonable.", "NTA. Your husband forgot that working long 12 hours shifts are exhausting? After 12 hours all I could do would be eat and rest and you are supposed to do so much cleaning? Definitely should talk to your husband and give him some ultimatum. This is ridiculous.", "Get on TikTok and look up \"thatdarnedchat\". She talks about the inequities of chores and childcare between men and women and how it often leads to divorce. You're living the exact problem she talks about.", "NTA, but this will not help. The only thing that WILL help is if you just stop cleaning up after him. Let his dish sit on the table, the pots get not cleaned or you put them back dirty after you cleaned and used them, his laundry doesn't get washed. Tell your family you are striking till they learn to clean up after themselfs. And then wait.", "Info: How many hours does your husband work?", "Info what's your husband's work schedule like? Does he have a full time job too, if not I don't see why he feels offended that he needs to help pick up the slack as well. Especially if he's the one making messes in the kitchen.  \n\n\nAlso getting your children into the habit of trying to clean up their messes and more earlier in life is a good thing to instill on them.", "Nta for wanting help, yta for making an unrequested list like you would (and did) for your children.\nAre the children also your partners? \nDoes partner also have a job?\nHow old are the kids?\nI\u2019d leave easy meals on my work days they can make themselves, not the healthiest idea but I\u2019d start there because it\u2019s fine if no one wants to do the dishes, I won\u2019t make them dirty and they can eat what they can microwave\u2026.\nIf the kids are younger (or even if not because kids suffering isn\u2019t a win) meal prep and freeze for them. Partner can root around and get what they find, make and clean up.", "I just want to not wake up to have to pick up all the things left around the house for me to do on my work days.", "He does the lawn when it\u2019s not snowing. He fixes stuff around the house when they break. He\u2019s painted and that kind of stuff.", ">When I\u2019m home he typically leaves the plates on the table after dinner for me to do or my oldest.\n\nIf you can't even take your own dirty dishes to the kitchen, you are a child not an adult. What OP has asked for is quite literally the bare minimum and the fact that he blew up as said he already does the bare minimum shows why OP doesn't treat him like a partner. Because he isn't.", "He works 40 hours a week during the day. I work midnights", "I work all different days from 7 p - 7:30a and sleep from 9-2. 2 is when I need to pick up my youngest from school", "My husband works Monday - Friday 9-6pm.", "I only made the list because I ask and ask  when he does help out it\u2019s only partially. Like he will put away the dishes from the dishwasher that he wants to put away and he will leave the silverware for me or the pots and pans to clean. He picks things up but leaves them in the sink. It\u2019s like partially helping but not really because I have to retrace his steps.", "He is doing nothing. Cant even take his plates the sink for gods sake. \n\nThe only things he does is the lawn when it's not snowing and fixing anything that breaks.\n\nThrow out the whole man", "He leaves the plates on the dinner table for you! He does nothing", "That is a very reasonable wish, to wake up to a clean kitchen. You both work, he should help you with the chores, you didn't even ask a lot from him. He shouldn't expect you to be the maid of the house. That's very old-fashioned thinking", "That's maintenance, not chores. Maintenance isn't daily. He's not doing any chores at all.", "He provides absolutely no value to the relationship. Leave him.", "Yeah that stuff happens once in a while, your doing everything", "Then the division of labor should be 50/50.\n\nNTA.", "NTA It's concerning how your husband is getting ticked off over just washing pots and pans and making sure the other clean and dried dishes from the dish drainer are properly put away.    \n\n\nIf he has to spend more time making a scene about doing the dishes than it would have taken him to actually do the dishes and properly put away the other clean and dried dishes, and still can't seem to see he's in the wrong then I'm at a loss for words as to how dense one adult man can be....", "Chores should be split equally but, are they his kids as well?
