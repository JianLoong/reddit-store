My friend decided that person should be me. \n\nShe calls me, with no warning as to what she wanted me to do. Imagine my surprise when I accept the call and she just tells me to speak to this couple with no context. Immediately, the parents start talking to me, and I don't understand anything they're saying. Why? Because I don't speak Mandarin. \n\nI was pretty annoyed at her, honestly. She gave me zero heads up. Not even a \"hey, this couple's kid is lost and we need someone that speaks Mandarin to communicate with them. Think you could help?\" before handing over the phone. \n\nShe texts me like 10 minutes later saying that the kid was found. Happy ending. I didn't respond with anything but a \"that's good to hear\".  I guess she could tell that I was upset based on my lack of reaction because she later called me to ask whether I was mad at her. I tell her honestly that yeah, I was pretty annoyed with her. \n\nShe asks me why. I tell her she gave me no heads up, and that she just assumed I would be able to speak Mandarin based on what, exactly? I have never said that I can speak Mandarin, to anyone, ever. \n\nShe defends herself saying that she just wanted to help out and wasn't thinking straight since it was a high stress situation. She said she had assumed I could speak it and didn't think to check. \n\nShe then gets annoyed at me saying I'm making this into a bigger thing than it needs to be, and that while she \"might have\" made a mistake not asking me beforehand and making assumptions but she doesn't feel bad because her intentions were pure.

That's a little racist.", "It certainly is racist and ignorant, but urging a person to excommunicate someone from their life without knowing whether or not this is part of a *pattern* of behavior seems to jump the gun and it\u2019s certainly the mindset younger and younger people seem to have. It\u2019s unfortunate that at a cultural moment when greater attention is being paid to mindfulness and engaging with difference respectfully that there is also a tendency, again it seems to me to be among young people, to assume the absolute worst intentions and to invoke punishment or non-engagement as the first reasonable response. I\u2019m not saying we need to coddle fascists or what have you, but to go from \u201cthis person did a microaggression\u201d to \u201cexcommunicate them from your life\u201d without knowing whether it\u2019s a pattern or isolated is not constructive and will probably just reinforce this friend\u2019s mentality that minorities are fragile or overly sensitive.", "Not really, I'm from a country where everyone literally looks the same, has the same cultre, speak the same language. Fuck, we don't even have accents that's how homogeneous the country is.\n\n\nI only learned that China has more than one language after I moved to the UK and just learned that one day from my client. \n\nDon't shout racism when often enough it's just the lack of knowledge and the failure of educational system.
