For example, how would she feel if she were in a group and a man there had a baby with him and the baby started to cry and so he handed the baby to her to calm down because she is a woman so she must know how to take care of a baby.

The Chinese vs Mandarin debate has been ongoing for decades and people who argue it usually look stupid on whichever moral high they try to sit on. Yes, there can be regionalism and dialects but that's usually not enough to call it another language. Cantonese and Mandarin have the same origins but have become more different over time. Even then there's some crossover. China is an extremely old country that has been 'broken and put back together' (to oversimplify it) many times. National identity and unity are strong components of society. Both Mandarin and Chinese are widely accepted both in and out of the country. That's without getting into the political conflicts between autonomy (independent vs two systems one state ideologies). There's a lot more history and politics involved but yeah.", "Dude.

They have no similarities, and sound nothing alike. You're right that this isn't the case with Cantonese and Mandarin.\n\nIt's like expecting someone who's Irish and speaks Gaelic to know and understand Ukranian.", "This is my exact problem with the word racist being thrown around in situations like this - it diminishes the strength of the word. Instead of gently explaining to an ignorant person why they are wrong and perhaps making them less ignorant, people throw the label racist at them, which usually ends with the person digging in their heels and distancing themselves from the group of people they are supposedly racist towards. Which often results in that person developing actual prejudice against a group of people (whether it be well meaning people who wanted to point out how someone could be so stupid, or the actual group of people they are being accused of being racist towards).

That's the wrong word. Prejudice maybe but but racist.", "Darling, what in the hell is \u2018written vernacular Chinese\u2019? Chinese is written with either simplified characters or unsimplified characters, and every school in the PRC teaches simplified characters and putonghua.

There's 7 main subgroups to Chinese languages and i can still only remember three. Not knowing doesn't make me a racist.
