For example, how would she feel if she were in a group and a man there had a baby with him and the baby started to cry and so he handed the baby to her to calm down because she is a woman so she must know how to take care of a baby.

They are not, and it gets really confusing to discuss the issue of language/dialect/etc in China if they\u2019re conflated.

Whereas liberal humanism essentially says there\u2019s a blank rhetorical position, which it doesn\u2019t realize is the position of the hegemon which was and is to say cishet white men, the kind of rhetoric you\u2019re engaging in essentially says \u201cwell, no, it\u2019s not cishet white men *only* it\u2019s also me.\u201d The issue isn\u2019t *who\u2019s* occupying that rhetorical position, the issue is how we understand authority and rhetoric in the first place. \n\nThe point I would like to make is that the sort of self division you\u2019re engaging in is historically situated, while for now it might appear to people to be the correct move it hasn\u2019t always been. They sort of ecumenical/international approach of Third Worldists in the 60s would be the counterpoint. The point is that, unfortunately yes the promise of liberal humanism and DEI has exhausted itself and because the future seems hopeless the most instinctive response is to simply say: I am right, those that disagree are wrong. It\u2019s pure solipsism. I don\u2019t want to be a vulgar Marxist about it, but it\u2019s ultimately worth pointing out that the undergirding logic is that capitalism can on the one hand use racism to establish itself (as in what\u2019s called \u201cprimitive accumulation,\u201d in the US taking the form of stealing land from indigenous people and using Black people as chattel) while also integrating racial identity, stratification, and isolation as means of control. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m being long winded is to show that I\u2019m engaging in good faith, I\u2019m not simply some white dudebro who wants to not talk about race etc. I\u2019m not claiming to be perfect, and I\u2019m certainly not claiming to understand your experience. What I\u2019m saying, though, is that you are taking the evidence of your experience at face value rather than trying to historicize why and how you\u2019re responding and that ultimately doing so will lead you nowhere further than your own navel.", "YTA lol\n\nWhat does the context of what happened have to do with *you*?

There\u2019s some upside down gen Z logic going on here. Trying and being awkward is not a crime or a sign of being a bad person.

People making an assumption based on race doesn't necessarily make them racsit. \n\nPeople making assumptions based on gender doesn't make them sexist or transphobic.  \n\nIf you're going to lose your shit because someone thought you spoke a language when you didn't? Then that's beyond fucking stupid.\n\nThis is coming from a trans Asian person. People think I'm Spanish or middle eastern all the time. I ain't throwing a tantrum over it.", "Except it isn\u2019t fifty-fifty, because there are more than three hundred distinct languages spoken in China, and as you\u2019ve said, will a non-speaker correctly identify what language is being spoken?\n\nI don\u2019t understand why this is such a sticking point for you. Everyone has done or said something that was ignorant. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong or bad about ignorance. It\u2019s a natural state for human beings. The telling part is how you handle recognizing your ignorance and doing better in the future.\n\nWhile it\u2019s understandable to want to do something to help, and it\u2019s nice to have good intentions, in the end the child was found and the friend did nothing to help make that happen by shoving a phone call with no context onto the OP. She probably made the parents even more desperate and frazzled.", "I thought it was the same except second person plural??", "Puerto Rican Spanish is just a dialect of Spanish based on the Spanish of all the folks that immigrated there from the Canary Islands in Spain.   So no, it\u2019s not ghetto Spanish.", "That\u2019s crazy! I\u2019m half Mexican, half white. \n\nBeen mistaken for Chinese, Japanese, 1/2 Filipina, Iranian, Jewish, and Native American.", "Does it say OP is losing their shit? No. It\u2019s natural to be hurt when someone that you\u2019re friends with seems to disregard what you\u2019ve stated about yourself. All she\u2019s saying is that she was annoyed and hurt, and again, even if she wanted to help, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to. What are you expecting her to do? \n\nI\u2019m not talking about the other commenters, I\u2019m talking about the story that OP laid out and the narrative that we\u2019ve been given. Yes, some Reddit comments have been making it seem like OP should be more worried about how her friend treated her rather than the child, but that\u2019s because that is what we\u2019re passing judgement on.", "So of course your next step is to learn Norwegian...", "My daughter is white, but ethnically ambiguous when she is tan. She has been called middle eastern, Hispanic, greek, native, Romani...she had two Hispanic grandmothers cooking for her and trying to marry her off until they found out she wasn't Hispanic. No more posole for her.", "Between the two of us I think we either have a full bingo or a Yahtzee card of mistaken nationalities, ethnicities, and identities!", "A coworker at an old job I worked at was an older white lady and she also knew Spanish because of her husband, she said that she startled people once because they were talking crap about her and they didn't think she could understand... Was in for a shock when she talked to them in Spanish lol", "I'm expecting her to have a rational reaction, shrug the moment off. Be grateful the kid was found okay and get on with their life. \n\nGetting so worked up that you need to get sympathy over social media, all because someone got confused over their knowledge on a language they don't speak is a tad ludicrous. \n\nAnd read OPs responses, shes very much acting like a big victim here.\n\nIf you're not talking about the other comments then why are you responding to me? Because I very clearly am talking about the other comments. My literal first comment is about all the other fucking comments?"]}
