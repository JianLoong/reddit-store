I (F25) have an ex boyfriend (M26) and we dated back in highschool, so nearly a decade ago. It was a really tough relationship, ended badly because of abuse (possibly narcissism) as well as a very complicated situation that unfolded with some friends. But in highschool he lived with me and my parents because his home situation was very broken/abusive and my parents took him in. After the break up. He stayed in touch with my parents. We've spoken once in awhile throughout the years just on messenger. But 2 years ago he blocked me after I told him I can't listen to complain how bad his life is if he isn't willing to change anything (drama \"follows\" him everywhere and the sky is always falling). \nHe reached out again a couple months ago panicking about how he's going to be a father. I may have messed up in answering at all but figured I'd be civil since my parents still talk to him. \n\nHere's where my parents come into the mix. as mentioned he's stayed in touch with them, when I had started dating again after him, he was still invited to certain family functions when I had new boyfriends there and they even went to his and his gf's baby shower.  \n\nLast week the baby was born. He's been sending me photos and I assume sending them to my parents. Yesterday him and my mom both texted me saying he's going to be going for supper at my parents on the weekend to show off the baby and they both said I should come. He said he'd understand if I didn't feel comfortable. But the request from my mom felt more like an expectation of me being there. I love my parents and in a lot of ways They're amazing. I just find the dynamic with this specific ex is really strange. Part of me wants to see the baby just cuz I like kids and he is super cute. But I can't be around that ex and I don't think I should reinforce this weird dynamic. It's like he's their 3rd child. And I know he lived with us for awhile. But that was almost a decade ago and he's not actually my brother. So I'm not sure I should be expected to attend. Not to mention, I'm not even sure if his girlfriend knows about this and I definitely don't want to add to that situation. So would I be the asshole if I didn't go?\n\nEdit: I've brought it up before that I found this dynamic weird. Like when he'd be invited to family events still. And yet myself and one aunt seem to be the only one who finds this messed up. My mom has told me I should be nice and that he doesn't have much family so he needs us to be there for him.", "created_utc": 1698325374, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gw1ao/wibta_if_i_dont_go_for_supper_at_my_parents_place/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I think if that's how you feel, possibly no one else *knows* that's how you feel at this point.  You've been staying in touch with this ex, the only gap in that was a gap HE chose when he blocked you, and he got back in touch.  \n\nThat said, I do think your ex was an asshole to you back in your decade-old relationship.  And then there's this:\n\n> I'm not even sure if his girlfriend knows about this and I definitely don't want to add to that situation.\n\nHe would 100% be an asshole if she doesn't know.  Especially because I strongly suspect she'd be *coming* to that supper - we're talking about a 1-week-old baby, no way he's flying solo with the baby at this point.  But you don't have to even check - you should assume she knows, and if she doesn't it's 100% on him and not you, it doesn't make you \"adding to\" that situation.\n\nAnd your parents would be assholes if you've expressed to them that you feel uncomfortable about their relationship with your ex and how they keep imposing it on you.", "This is strange. Keep your distance. NTA.", "I think that you might be reading more into your mother's invitation than is actually there.  This may just be a casual suggestion.  From your post, it seems that you do not have any animosity towards your ex, but you are very clear eyed about it not being a good relationship.  Your mother has clearly forgotten that part & only sees the ex as a bonus child, not as someone who treated her daughter badly.  While I think that it is commendable that your parents want to help someone whose biological parents were not the best, you do not need to be part of it.  I cannot fault your parents for wanting to help this person as long as it was not at the expense of their own child.  Nor do I blame your ex for wanting supporting adults in his life.  And you obviously are not out of line to want limited contact with an ex.\n\nI would just decline the invite and state what you told us - that it makes you uncomfortable and could lead to issues with the ex's new relationship.  Your parents probably need to be reminded of this, but right now I don't see their behavior as anything too outrageous.\n\nNAH", "NTA. You're right, this dynamic is next level weird and uncomfortable.\n\nIt's already very dubious that your parents decided to stay so involved with an ex who was abusive towards you - but I won't judge them too hard for that now, as I haven't heard their reasons (and that's not what the question was about anyway). It's *absolutely not okay* that they're trying to force a sibling dynamic between you and him, however. I cringed just from reading that.", "NTA. I hope you\u2019ve told your parents about everything.", "NTA. You need to set boundaries with your parents. Everyone will be happy once they learn to respect you. Tell them that you are not interested in having your ex in you life IN ANY WAY and that if they decide to have him in their lofe that is fine. But he will never be in your. EVER, in ANY WAY. This means that you will never be in the same room as him REGARDLESS of the event or situation. If they persist in trying to force you to have a relationship with him you will reduce contact with them and if it persists still, it will be NC. And that will not change if you have children.", "NAH. Even if he were your brother (which it sounds like your parents are happy to treat him as), you wouldn't be obligated to continue a relationship with him just because others do. It sounds like a casual, distant relationship might be more comfortable than completely cutting him off, but you do you!\n\nThat said, it's sweet that your parents care so much for him and unless you make your boundaries clear, it's OK for them to encourage you to keep up a close relationship with someone they love.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Especially when the break up first happened. I just have issues with cutting people off WHILE they're being nice and respectful. So when he can be civil so can I. If he hadn't blocked me that day I probably still would of blocked him for awhile cuz he was very worked up about it. And the first time he did reach out, I ignored it. It's my mom that told me he was gonna have a baby. So when he reached out a second time figured I'd just congratulate him and be done.", "To be clear, I think the boundary-setting that's needed is with your parents, not so much with him.  You could just stop talking to him, you don't owe him any explanation.  But you don't want to cut off your relationship with your parents so you need to TELL them how uncomfortable situations like this make you and tell them they need to respect this. \n\nTHEM having him over for supper to meet his baby - not exactly \"fine\" but it's not your business.  Them asking you to be there is NOT fine in the future, and only okay this time to the extent they didn't realize this.  Them *pressuring* you to come and make nice, utterly unacceptable, and will damage your relationship.  \n\nYour parents could understand this.  No guarantees, but it's hard for them to get it if you don't say it."]}
