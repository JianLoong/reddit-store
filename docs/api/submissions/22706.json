Apart from her cleats, we didn't start buying new equipment until kiddo moved into 12U (maybe her second year of 10U). We had several neighbors whose daughters played fastpitch and were more then happy to part with their gently used equipment for a fair price. Gloves, bats, catcher's equipment, even a helmet (never worn, still had the price tag sticker) were all bought second hand at 8U. \n\nYou don't know if they're going to stick with it or not. And $400 for an 8U bat? Ridiculous. Is he buying her an Easton Ghost?"]}
