It would be fine for her to offer the information (in case anyone else wanted to splurge), but the fact that she\u2019s getting married doesn\u2019t entitle her to having everyone stay at the same hotel - *especially* if she wants to spend that kind of money.

Depending on where you want to go, $1,250 is often enough to cover a week-long vacation at an all-inclusive resort\u2026and might even be enough to cover airfare, too. Most people either cannot or will not drop the cost of their major living expenses - or a personal vacation of their choosing - on *one night* at a hotel. It\u2019s just not a reasonable or appropriate thing to expect other people to do for you.\n\nETA: If you\u2019re also going to be in the wedding party, there will likely be other things that she wants you to spend money on. Is your sister going to want the budget-friendly options, or is she going to pick out more expensive versions of everything? Wedding stuff adds up fast. I was just in a wedding, and between the bachelorette party, a relatively inexpensive bridesmaid dress, a manicure and pedicure (which I had done at a cheaper salon), hair and makeup the day of the wedding, and 2 nights in a budget hotel - I spent well over $1,000.

I know that even a couple floors away I couldn\u2019t get in touch with my mom (not answering the room phone and cell service was terrible) and it did cause a decent amount of worry and confusion while I was hurrying to get ready. \n\nMaybe assure her that this will in no way affect your ability to support her and be there if anything is needed.", "NTA $1250 is fucking absurd", "Your sister is ridiculously entitled. If she wanted to stay close with her family she should have chosen a more affordable accommodation.\nI wonder if she's really upst because the more guests she took to the hotel, the greater discount she'd had", "NTA. If I have to spend $1250 I'm not going to the wedding, I'll be in my hotel room making the most of it and charging room service to the wedding account. I know of no conceivable event for any person I have ever met that I would willingly drop so much money on, other people's joy would struggle extremely hard to be worth 1% of that to me.", "NTA. If it\u2019s not in your budget, you absolutely should not pay $1250/night for the hotel. Ridiculous. Maybe the groom\u2019s family has more money and they don\u2019t mind the absurd cost, but she doesn\u2019t get to make that decision for everyone else and her being upset about it is tacky.", "So my stepsister got married in cancun. She realized half the people couldn\u2019t afford it. Didn\u2019t hold it against anyone. I stayed on the other side of the resort in the poor people building lol. Which was still a 5 star resort and nicer in the cheaper rooms i had ever seen. My car blew up before the trip. I had to choose to either get an older car and go or a nicer car. Because I haven\u2019t had a vacation for 15 yrs i went anyway and got a crappier car. But unless they were going to pay for your rooms. They should be grateful you\u2019re still going and made it work for you both. You\u2019re nta", "NTA, your family finance health always come first. It's not like her marriage will blown apart because her family decide to stay 5 minute away from her wedding venue. Don't jump into the comparison game with her future in laws.", "\ud83e\udd23 80 USD a night for Mexico City is actually not cheap. For tourists, possibly depending on where they're from. For nationals who on average get paid around 600 USD per month, heck to the no.", "NTA at all. 1250 bucks is worth more than her hurt feelings, sorry not sorry.", "NTA. Most stayed at the venue when I got married, but I was paying for the rooms, so.. if she wants people to stay there specifically, she could do the same", "1250 is an unacceptable rate for a hotel room", "I read this as \u201cpowering my ass\u201d"]}
