She wanted our family to stay as well but the price of $1,250 per room (we would need 4 rooms) is just not feasible so instead we booked a rental flat 5mins walk away for our family of 8. All was good but I\u2019ve been told on the down low that my sister is not actually very happy we did this as the groom side of the family paid for the expensive hotel stay on their side(but they only need 2 rooms as opposed to our side which would need 4).\n\nTherefore I may be the asshole for not considering her feelings of it\u2019s a once in a lifetime wedding and should have just paid the money?\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The truth is, it might be that the B&G can't afford the room either.  They could be using a group block rate, where a hotel will give the couple a huge discount (or even a free stay) if they have xx number of people staying for their event. \n\nYou're not TA, sis is a little bit for letting it leak \"on the dl\" that she's upset.

I'm having a hard time figuring out how not staying in some $1250 hotel somehow takes away from your sister's wedding?  You will all be close enough to get together in the evenings, but you certainly shouldn't put yourselves under further financial stress just so you can be in the same resort.  That's absurd.  I would NEVER ask my family to spend that money and would only suggest it if it was going to be something that my husband and I could pay for everyone.  I'd rather get a flat or a VRBO nearby that I didn't have to sell my soul to afford and I could have a little more space to stretch out.
