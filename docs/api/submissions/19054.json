It would be fine for her to offer the information (in case anyone else wanted to splurge), but the fact that she\u2019s getting married doesn\u2019t entitle her to having everyone stay at the same hotel - *especially* if she wants to spend that kind of money.

Depending on where you want to go, $1,250 is often enough to cover a week-long vacation at an all-inclusive resort\u2026and might even be enough to cover airfare, too. Most people either cannot or will not drop the cost of their major living expenses - or a personal vacation of their choosing - on *one night* at a hotel. It\u2019s just not a reasonable or appropriate thing to expect other people to do for you.\n\nETA: If you\u2019re also going to be in the wedding party, there will likely be other things that she wants you to spend money on. Is your sister going to want the budget-friendly options, or is she going to pick out more expensive versions of everything? Wedding stuff adds up fast. I was just in a wedding, and between the bachelorette party, a relatively inexpensive bridesmaid dress, a manicure and pedicure (which I had done at a cheaper salon), hair and makeup the day of the wedding, and 2 nights in a budget hotel - I spent well over $1,000.

I\u2019m not sure I would do that again for my *own* wedding much less almost double for my sister\u2019s.", "Exactly.  It\u2019s beyond the bad form or being inconsiderate to impose this kind of expense.", "Or paid for it herself. If she\u2019s not paying, she can\u2019t dictate.", "If OP is expected to be in the bridal party, it will be even more of an obligation and even less of a treat. The cost of being in a wedding can easily add up into the thousands. If their sister is expecting everyone to stay in a $1,250/night hotel, I\u2019d hazard a guess that she\u2019s also going to want more expensive *everything.*", "We are the scenery.. I love that. Just a bunch of NPCs walking around lmao", "Hopefully.", "Its not OP's job or obligation to empty her bank account to make her sister look \"good enough\" for her IL's.  If this is actually the case I'd tell OP to suggest some therapy for the bride.   Honestly I lean more towards the bride getting a major discount...which still makes her a shitty sister.\n\nSucks for the bride.", "Half my monthly rent, but still more than I'd pay to stay one night in a hotel room I'll barely even get to use.", "Just went to a wedding in Mexico City. It was so fun to have everyone at the same hotel\u2026 which cost $80/night.", "We just went to a wedding like this. There was a discounted rate for the whole block of rooms for the wedding. It wasn\u2019t crazy cheap but it was reasonable but it was also our choice and not required.", "that\u2019s cheap for CA honestly"]}
