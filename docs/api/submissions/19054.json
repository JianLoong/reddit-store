She wanted our family to stay as well but the price of $1,250 per room (we would need 4 rooms) is just not feasible so instead we booked a rental flat 5mins walk away for our family of 8. All was good but I\u2019ve been told on the down low that my sister is not actually very happy we did this as the groom side of the family paid for the expensive hotel stay on their side(but they only need 2 rooms as opposed to our side which would need 4).\n\nTherefore I may be the asshole for not considering her feelings of it\u2019s a once in a lifetime wedding and should have just paid the money?\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She doesn\u2019t get to dictate where you stay if she\u2019s not paying.", "NTA. You guys are literally right around the corner and can prbly come and go freely anyway.

Just because it's in the budget for the groom's side of the family doesn't mean your sister should have any expectation of you guys being in the same spot.

Chances are, she'll be divorcing in less than 5 years...", "NTA.\n\nNobody should be expected to go into dire financial hardship just to attend a wedding family or not. Where you stay is your choice.\n\nWhen did it become a thing for the bride to command you to stay in her specified accommodation choice?", "NTA. If she\u2019s embarrassed you can\u2019t afford that and others can, that\u2019s her problem. I\u2019ve stayed in lot of nice hotels (mostly on a business expense account) and that is a very high price.", "NTA.  That price is ridiculous.  My guess is she needed a certain amount of rooms booked to get a deal.", "Lmaooooo what in the Kardashian did i read? 1250 for ONE NIGHT! Unless your sister is planning on sleeping in the room with you, why would she care so much. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nIf it\u2019s not a good idea financially, you can\u2019t stay at that hotel and she needs to respect that decision.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nIf she wants you there, she can pay for all your rooms.

Your sister is the AH here if she's actually upset about this.", "NTA\n\nYour sister sounds ridiculous lol. There\u2019s worse things to be upset about", "\u201cOnce in a lifetime\u201d for HER, not for you.\n\nI think that\u2019s the part brides seem to forget. For the rest of us it\u2019s an obligation, not a treat. It doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t love and support the bridal couple, but they never seem to understand that the guests aren\u2019t living the fairytale. We are just the scenery. \n\n$1250/ night is ridiculous for regular people, and what is it, exactly, you\u2019re taking away from her by not being in the same hotel? NTA", "NTA. She probably gets some kind of discount on her own room if enough people book, but you are under no obligation to subsidize her.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find she gets a discounted rate for the more people she has stay, that\u2019s why she wants you to all stay their.", "> my husband cannot justify paying that much for one night as we have other expenses to pay\n\nYou aren't being ungrateful or bratty by living within your means.  The truth is, it might be that the B&G can't afford the room either.  They could be using a group block rate, where a hotel will give the couple a huge discount (or even a free stay) if they have xx number of people staying for their event. \n\nYou're not TA, sis is a little bit for letting it leak \"on the dl\" that she's upset.  If she's upset, she can put on her big girl pants and use her words like an adult.    So I'm gonna go NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
