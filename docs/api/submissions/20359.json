This is further validated by the fact that literally everything you describe about your affectionate relationship with Emma can be summed up as \"sisterly\".

If there's some trauma or past issue there that makes him uncomfortable with physical affection in other people or some insecurity about being replaced in the friend group, it might be something that communication can help to find the source of the conflict and talk through it. He's still TA regardless, but if the issue can be fixed with good communication it's worth trying.

Would that even be good for her or is it just totally isolating?\n\nIt just sounds like this guy is not a compatable match for a casually affectionate bi woman. He clearly needs someone who is more reserved with physical affection if he has these insecurities or boundaries for a relationship.

If he's telling you that how you are acting around another bi woman is making him uncomfortable and asking you stop, and you are affectionate by nature don't want to change that/don't want to stop, then...Maybe you guys aren't compatible? Insecurity can be ugly.\n\nNAH.", "Different people have different boundaries though. You may not mind it but your boyfriend clearly does and you are ignoring him over it", "Hmm... NTA, at least until the two of you can sit down and have a proper heart to heart about the situation. Maybe he has a reason for being insecure that you don't know about. It doesn't excuse his behaviour but it might go some way to explaining it.", "Gay jokes?", "He wasn't invited, end of sentence. Even if OP eventually \"allowed\" him to come along, he wasn't invited, it wasn't his hangout to attend, he's still the AH.", "I don\u2019t think anyone itt (certainly not me) is saying a hug is a big deal. It\u2019s hugging, linking arms, leaning on each other etc that eventually scans as flirty. I mean, op even wrote that her friends \u201ctease\u201d her and Emma about their \u201cPDA\u201d so it\u2019s not like op\u2019s bf is the only one who notices and thinks it\u2019s out of the ordinary.\n\nBut sure, the posters itt are the weird ones for noticing what op\u2019s friends also noticed.", "I'd still say she's TA. She's flirting with someone in front of him. That's so disrespectful. She can easily just not do that.", "Yes", "Oh right, forgot you were there when it happened", "I'm sorry if it wasn't clear in the comment before. Our friends tease my boyfriend and me about our PDA. Not Emma.", "THOSE \ud83d\udc4f ARE \ud83d\udc4f ALL \ud83d\udc4f NORMAL \ud83d\udc4f THINGS \ud83d\udc4f FOR \ud83d\udc4f WOMEN \ud83d\udc4f TO \ud83d\udc4f DO \ud83d\udc4f apparently I have to scream it from the freaking rooftops to get through your thick skulls here. None of those are uncommon behaviors for women who are close friends, I do the same things with my own friends, and guess what? I'm a straight female through and through. Just because they're bi doesn't mean they're not allowed do the same thing because some little boy is controlling and insecure about himself.\n\nAll the \"posters\" here are men who clearly don't know how women work because the fact that you all think women going to the bathroom together is weird shows how disconnected from reality you really are. \n\nAnd I *LOVE* how you all conveniently look past the part where the boyfriend is *physically abusing her in public* to skip right to the judgement of OP for \"fLiRtiNG\" because she's a woman and clearly is responsible for him feeling that way, boo hoo. Get over yourselves, really.", "In *my* relationship? Oh, yeah, that'd be flirting, and neither me nor my husband would ever be like that with anyone else. But OP says she is similarly affectionate with all of her friends, so if that's true it's why I said I can't call her the AH. If she's like this with everybody and he's only upset about her being like this with Emma, it just screams *another straight dude insecure about having a bi gf* imo.", "You\u2019re gonna have to explain how that analogy applies, sorry. \n\nIt\u2019d be more like if a guy was ignoring his girlfriend while holding hands and snuggling with another person in front of her, making her uncomfortable. That would be shitty. Her response might also be shitty.", "You should probably add this info to an edit on the original post. A lot of people are getting the wrong idea and thinking you meant between you and Emma.", "Ah I misunderstood. Sorry.", "Keep screaming from the rooftops I guess. Super weird to me that you don\u2019t see how sexual orientation bears on how this would be perceived but it\u2019s pretty clear we\u2019re not going to see eye to eye. Have a good night.", "I think that because Emma was his friend first, OP may feel more comfortable addressing how he feels about the way they interact. I still think TA because the flirting is disrespectful and she knows he doesn't like it but wants to continue to act like this anyway", "Thats not the same. Friendships are different with different genders. For example for sleepovers girls have no problem sharing a bed. However when guys do they sleep head to two. \n\nI was giving an example of what some guy friend do that is normal. That could be seen as flirting in different situations however between two guy friends it isnt.", "What you described isn\u2019t flirting in any sense. That\u2019s just homophobia", "You've hid the fact that you're both bisexual in the comments.\n\nESH\n\nThe rules change when you're attracted to their gender.\n\nIf your boyfriend was doing it with a female friend of his, you wouldn't be happy, and reddit would be screaming and crying about how evil he is.\n\nThe boyfriend is also being an AH, overkill and going to far, but if I were him I'd be done with the relationship, its called boundaries - he put some up and you just don't agree with them, that's the end of it.\n\nedit - changed to ESH", "This is the 2nd time you're here about this guy. Ditch bf, get with Emma", "YTA, if your bf was acting this affectionate with someone you'd probably be upset too.", "I was gonna say NTA at first but seeing that you left out that youre both bi makes me think YTA, not saying your bfs reaction was great but its clear that what youre doing is making him uncomfortable and insecure and seeing you leaving out that information makes me think you know that.", "Most of these comments are wild to me\u2026\n\nYTA Imagine for a second you were doing the exact same thing with a male friend in front of your boyfriend. Would you see how he might feel uncomfortable? Yes, some women express friendship like that but, given that you are bi, it\u2019s not unreasonable for him to feel uncomfortable.", "YTA  It sounds like you'd prefer Emma's hugs and touches to your boyfriend's. If you want to be with her at least have the decency to break up with him first instead of trying to publicly humiliate him while trying to get together with someone else in front of him.", "NTA. He missed his chance at trying to setup a threesome...", "100% NTA", "NTA OP.  Rehome this horny dog.", "Dude played this all wrong. It totally could have worked out in his favor. Or at least that\u2019s what I want to believe.", "Ah yes, the classic 'bi people cannot be friends with anyone'", "So OP's boyfriend now has the right to gatekeep all of his bisexual partner's friends because either gender could be a potential threat? How is that not toxic af? Just because OP's bisexual doesn't mean that she views *everyone* in a romantic way, and I don't understand why there's such a huge gap between how people view a straight female friendship and a bisexual female friendship- they're all women, ffs. If OP's boyfriend doesn't trust her because of his own insecurities, that's on him, not her, and he should end the relationship if he feels so threatened by behavior that is so commonplace within a female friendship.", "\ud83e\udd23", "Bisexual women are women who can have friends, too, you people are so exhausting. And go ahead, just glance over the fact that her boyfriend physically and verbally abused her like every other misogynistic male who's posted in this comment section.", "Exactly the reaction I expected. A man isn't allowed to have suspicion about his bi gf going out with another bi woman.\n\nYou're right that he should end the relationship. He's expected to care for her feelings, but to hell with his? Nope.", "Sorry, no one goes to the bathroom with someone they want to find them attractive. Unless they have a thing. 'oh excuse me honey while i let out this giant fart then pee like a racehorse'\n\nGirls go to the bathroom together as standard. Especially girls 25 and under.", "I said in another post the kick was unacceptable. \n\nVerbal abuse? Oh right, I forgot.\n\nWhen a man expresses disagreement with a woman it's \"abuse.\"\n\nAs to your first sentence, yeah they can. And he can decide \"fuck it , I'm out\" instead of chasing a woman who disregards his feelings.\n\nWhich is what he should have done, rather than follow her out on the town like a little puppy.", "Damn right, to hell with his poor wittle feewings when he's an abusive AH. How about him kicking OP? There's your Nope. Or harassing her when she didn't want to be touched? Another Nope. But you're just gonna ignore that part like every other man in this comment section because you all are blind when it comes to \"the man\" doing something wrong, but you gotta laser-focus on the woman doing something \"wrong\" when she isn't doing anything wrong at all.", "Your first sentence says it all. F his feelings\n\nYep, exactly what I expected.\n\nEDIT: reading comprehension, get some. I said the kick was over the line. He shouldn't have even been there at all. Should have left with his stuff after she went out.", "That's not \"standing up for himself,\" standing up for himself would be actually communicating to OP *in a healthy manner* about his feelings and then coming to a compromise that works for both of them or ending the relationship if he can't handle being with someone who is bisexual, take your uneducated misogyny elsewhere \ud83d\ude44 I'm done engaging with your stupidity.", "She's not flirting. People can be friendly and affectionate and chatty without flirting.\n\nJust because *you* think that's flirting doesn't mean it is.\n\nI've had people say \"omg you were flirting with xxxx\" my whole life just because I've been chatting to/having a laugh with someone. No, I wasn't flirting, I was talking to them like I would talk to anyone who is also chatty/having a laugh. This has included me being accused of \"flirting\" with men over twice my age, who are deeply unattractive to me. But remain human beings. \n\nYou can't flirt accidentally because flirting has meaning behind it, for you. If someone else misreads your actions that's a *them* problem not a *you* problem.", "Wahh wahh , it's misogyny when a man disagrees with a woman\n\nBuh bye"]}
