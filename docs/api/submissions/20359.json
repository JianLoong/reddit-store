This is further validated by the fact that literally everything you describe about your affectionate relationship with Emma can be summed up as \"sisterly\". You're not making out with her or even playfully flirting . . . you're showing the sort of affection that sisters do, even to their brothers, even as children. \n\nHugging, leaning on each other, putting an arm around each other, even holding hands - these are ways that I see my young nieces and nephews show their affection for each other all the time.

If there's some trauma or past issue there that makes him uncomfortable with physical affection in other people or some insecurity about being replaced in the friend group, it might be something that communication can help to find the source of the conflict and talk through it. He's still TA regardless, but if the issue can be fixed with good communication it's worth trying.

He clearly needs someone who is more reserved with physical affection if he has these insecurities or boundaries for a relationship.

Why not?\n\nBy your logic, OP\u2019s boyfriend is never allowed to interact affectionately with a woman because it _obviously the rules change when you\u2019re attracted to their gender._ I mean, the friend in question was _his_ friend first\u2013 does that give OP leeway to kick him under the table should he act affectionately with her?\n\nYou are perpetuating old stereotypes akin to that of \u201cgirls and boys can\u2019t just be friends, they have to end up dating!\u201d", "According to reddit bisexual people can\u2019t have legitimate friendships and you should be beholdent to your partner\u2019s unfounded jealousy.\n\nNTA your boyfriend is controlling at the very least, probably biphobic like this comment section too", "If he feels uncomfortable, that's somewhat reasonable. But the way he chose to express those feelings was to berate her and KICK HER. NOT acceptable! She is NTA.", "So bi people can\u2019t have make or female friends because they \u201ccould\u201d find them attractive? Well fuck us then.", "Idk where do you live but I've seen plenty of female young adults (and even some adults) be like this between each other. I hug my guy friends regularly, sometimes even lean on them - and my SO doesn't mind, because he understands they are more like brothers to me. Same goes for him and his \"sisters\". There is nothing sexual about this.", "It sounds like he sees this as sexual? Weird", "Being bi = not able to have ANY friends. Got it, need to cut some people off, brb.", "Ah yes, can\u2019t go wrong with some good ol\u2019 male fantasy of a threesome with a friend\u2026 -.-", "HE'S KICKING HER UNDER THE TABLE. No deep analysis required. You're literally inviting her to sit down with him and discuss how they can work together to accommodate his control issues. FOH.", "Why would he have \"the same\" relationship with Emma as OP? This is not about how OP would feel if the bf were tactile with Emma. That's projection, that is. It's about how out of character it is for the individual concerned. If OP is a naturally tactile person, she will have tactile friendships. If she is usually not demonstrative, and is all over one particular person - whatever respective sexualities are (usually not the general public's business, but here we are) - then something's off. That's all. How out of character someone is acting. Out of character for them.\n\nIf bf is not okay with a tactile gf, that's not her problem. Until he starts physically and verbally abusing her, that is. Oh - wait.", "What is with reddit thinking bisexual people can\u2019t have friends", "The behavior you see as flirting would be normal between a lot of family members but okay", "Family members", "Do you also go to the bathroom with him and link hands with him ? Unless you do, this is not the same.", "Seems to me in the end you both handled the sitiation badly.\n\nHe needs to stop making you feel uncomfortable when you make him uncomfortable.\n\nBut you also shouldnt dismiss him beeing uncomfortable."]}
