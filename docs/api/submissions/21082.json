And we have three kids (11F, 9F, 8M). Me and my wife are going on a trip together in a few weeks and my BIL (my late brother\u2019s long term fianc\u00e9) would be looking after the kids while we were gone.\r  \n\r  \nNow for some context that will be relevant, mr and my eldest child are overweight, and my wife and our youngest two are obese. My wife loves her body as is and I love her no matter what, she really into something called \u201cthe fat acceptance movement\u201d, which makes her happy so i support but I know bearly anything about it. My BIL and his two kids are healthy and in shape.\r  \n\r  \nTwo days ago I went to my BIL\u2019s house to help set things up and go over his house rules. We set up a bunk bed in the spare room (it already had a bed but now it has three) and afterwards he made lunch and we sat down to talk. He went through some of the house rules he has that he would expect my kids to follow, and they were all really fair, things like cleaning up your own mess, keeping your room tidy, helping with chores around the house. These arnt rules he made up for my kids, they are the rules that is kids already follow.\r  \n\r  \nThen there was the food rule, my BIL says that he controls the kids portions and how many snacks he gets them, but he had no control over food and snacks the kids buy themselves using allowance. I asked if I could join them for dinner so I could see and he said year. He served dinner and I immediately saw the difference between the food he makes and what my wife makes. I then saw his kids serve their own portions and were about half the size and what me and our kids would have and a third of what my wife would have. And I\u2019m not saying my BIL isn\u2019t feeding his kids properly, I\u2019m just pointing out the difference. I also found out that they only have desert a few times a week and only after dinner, while my wife will serve desert after every meal that isn\u2019t breakfast.\r  \n\r  \nI honestly really liked how my BIL handled food with his kids and was thinking to possibly imploring soemthing similar in our house after the trip if our kids adjusted well to it. Anyway I went home and was explaining the rules to my wife and then we got to the one about food and she flipped out. She said that no one should police how much someone else eats, especially if you arnt that person\u2019s parent.\n\nShe accused my BIL of being fatphobic purposely targeting her kids. I tried to explain that he had these rules for his kids aswell, and that we can just make sure our kids have enough allowance to get whatever snacks they want, and that I actually liked the idea.\n\nShe started screaming at me calling me fatphobic and accusing me of wanting her and the kids to lose weight. I kinda do, not because I don\u2019t find her attractive, just because I want my family to be healthy. She refused to talk to me after this, and says I\u2019m trying to force a harmful diet onto our kids, so AITA?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1688216695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nuo7y/aita_for_forcing_my_kids_to_go_on_a_diet/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am fat. So hear this from someone that is not in good shape here. I love myself, I am comfortable in my own skin, but I do get a lot of judgement from my extended family. So I get the fat acceptance and think it can be a very healthy mindset.  \n\nWhat your SIL is doing is feeding her children an appropriate level of food and snacks. It sounds regulated but it's actually more like - here is the food you need to be healthy!   \n\nYour wife is overfeeding you and your family. So your kids are obese and overweight not because of fat acceptance, but because of overfeeding. Especially unlimited sweets and snacks.  \n\nNow... there is a third way here where you limit portions to a ln age appropriate amount of food, serve healthier food, and less Desserts. Like a lot less Desserts. Not to lose weight but to promote a healthy lifestyle no matter your size.    \n\nAnd to try and be active. Start little by little. A short hike. Going outside to walk around a bit. Throwing a football.   \n\nAll of this is promote good health NOT physical looks. That brings about a healthy view of self.  \n\nYour wife seems to have a bigger issue. It's probably trauma or something that leads her to over correct.  \n\nYou will be doing your kids a huge favor by promoting healthy habits.   \n\nLosing weight is a different discussion.   \n\nBTW your kids will have trouble adjusting to the food intake because they will have a really high percentage of less sugar", "NTA\n\nas you've witnessed for yourself, BIL's family eats less, and occasionally enjoys dessert \ud83c\udf68 maybe twice a week.\n\nWhile your family, eats double to triple BIL's portions with sweets after lunch and dinner.\n\nYour observations, they are in shape and healthy!\n\nAccept the fact that your wife wants to eat her responsibilities to her own health and doesn't want to acknowledge the fact her size is proportional to her food intake.\n\nNot envious of your situation.", "NTA\n\nPortion control, and not eating as much as you can every meal, is very important to learn at a young age.  And also, your wife serves dessert at lunch?", "NTA\n\nlook, I'm fat and I know it. I'm not huge but for sure I'm bigger than I technically should be. However I'm healthy and active. If your kids are obese at that age it can have serious heath ramifications.  portion control is a great idea to help have a healthy relationship with food without going down the road of banning foods and forcing diet and exercise.", "I personally agree that parents should serve their kids healthy portions (my parents did and I\u2019ve never been overweight) and that dessert should be an occasional treat, not something they have every meal. Maybe taken to your pediatrician.\n\nNTA, but I\u2019m not sure that matters if your wife thinks you are.", "NTA.\nBeing obese is very bad. Your BIL has a healthy serving and dessert plan which is in NO way a diet but in fact a proper healthy way of eating. She is completely overreacting! She can of course eat as she likes but when in someone's house it is polite manners to eat the food provided. Raising healthy children is not being fatphobic it is making sure you have strong healthy children. If you are not sure about trying this then compare the energy levels and health of each group of kids. Portion control is incredibly useful to learn and obesity leads to a lot of health problems later in life. At the very least have a talk with the children's doctor about the long term effects of obesity.", "NTA\n\nYour BIL impressed you with his family\u2019s healthy relationship with food, you want to have that same healthy relationship for your family. You should stick to your guns. It isn\u2019t fat shaming to want to be healthier and have a healthier relationship with food.", "NTA but honestly you are doing no good by your kids. You teach them and show them what to eat and to be honest a dessert after each meal lunch and dinner every day of the week is extreme. I also guess it's not like fruits but a \"real\" dessert like cake, candy, etc. Sugar can also be seen as a drug and can lead to health issues especially if you say the are already overweight/obese and they didn't even hit their teenage years. And this is not going on a diet. Also, the bil let's them buy stuff with there allowance.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s being ridiculous. She has got to see that your kids are just too big for their ages. \n\nI\u2019d get the pediatrician to explain to wife that your kids are unhealthy, not just bigger. \n\nI\u2019d also have a chat with the kids themselves. The 8 yo might not understand it fully, but certainly the 11 and 9 yo are capable of recognizing that they are bigger than their peers. And I\u2019d bet they\u2019re not happy about it. \n\nExplain the food rules at bil\u2019s for when they will be staying there, and ask them to try it out and see how they feel about it. They might surprise you when you get back from your trip and want to begin a more healthy way of eating.", "NTA your wife body choices are legitimate. But is your duty is a parents to set you MINOR children up to a healthy start. Once they are adult they can make their own choices. As for your wife, she should look into child obesity and consequences and then see if this is really a choice she wants for her children. Accepting your body and love it and demand respect form other people had nothing to do with starting better life choice for you and your family.", "NTA. You have already failed your kids in allowing them to become overweight and obese. Start doing your job as a parent and start teaching your kids healthy habits.", "NTA Your wife has an eating disorder that she is foisting on your children. She is setting them up for health issues in the future. Your BIL's method of feeding his kids is very reasonable, and it wouldn't hurt to have your kids exposed to it. But you admiring his way of eating is being seen by your wife as an attack on her lifestyle and parenting choices.\n\nBe prepared for it to not go well if you do this. If your kids are used to eating such large portions, they will likely still feel hungry after dinner and be upset at feeling deprived. They may give your BIL a hard time and overeat their snacks.\n\nThe best way to make this work would be to gradually reduce their portion sizes in preparation for staying with him. But with your wife not on board this is unlikely to happen. \n\nYour wife is hurting your children's health. If you want this to change you need to either persuade her, possibly in therapy, or make an ultimatum that could imperil your marriage.", "NTA. Focus on how the weight issue is impacting the kids school and extracurricular activities, long term health benefits and possible anti-bullying effect.\nTalk to your kids paediatrician and your wife's physician, so they may show her the scientific benefits of a healthy weight. It's not about fat loss, it's about health gain.", "Maybe change your diet and act as an example? Your BIL was an example for you. You can be one for your family. \n\nYou are the a-hole for letting it go on for this long.

Wanting to be a little healthier with food is a good thing", "NTA it\u2019s sad because I feel obesity is an epidemic. My cholesterol was through the roof and I was pre diabetic when I was obese. Now I\u2019m in the overweight category and my cholesterol is at a healthy level and my pre diabetes is reversed. The fat acceptance movement is about confidence but also cannot ignore health. You don\u2019t need to be totally skinny to be considered healthy but obesity can kill. Do you want your children to have to suffer from preventable disease like high blood pressure, diabetes and even some cancer risks are increased like colon cancer.", "NTA. she has food issues and needs a therapist. good for you for trying to make conscious choices about your kids health. habits are everything. health is everything.", "NTA \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"my eldest child are overweight, and my wife and our youngest two are obese. \" .., this is abusing your kids and hurting their health. Shitty parenting.", "Nta keeping your kids fed is one thing but keeping them healthy is another. Being obese at such a young age can cause problems later in life which you can avoid if you start now. You\u2019re wife is only thinking about what you usually eat and not what you could be eating to help reduce the excess food. Does she have a problems with a reasonable serve of veggies? By doing  what she is doing she is risking her kids health.", "is this real?? do people like your wife seriously exist? wtf", "Your wife can be a unhealthy, delusional idiot all she wants but I would not tolerate that behavior when she's shoving it down your kids throats quite literally (NTH)", "NTA.  Your wife has chosen to have unhealthy habits and wants to be proud of that, and is putting your children\u2019s health at risk.  There are healthy ways to approach weight loss.  I highly recommend you, your kids and wife see a professional dietician and therapist.  There\u2019s a lot of work to be done here.  Also wtf, dessert at every meal excepts breakfast? Lemme guess, it\u2019s usually a sweet breakfast like pancakes or French toast.   Also dessert can be a cup of fresh fruit.  Donuts for dessert??", "NTA, and the way you describe your wife's behaviour doesn't sound at all like body positivity, it sounds like she has a food addiction and is in extreme denial. The reacting with screaming and crying and accusations of \"shaming\", DARVO, that is absolutely addict behaviour.\n\nThe problem is, in a \"misery loves company\" kind of way, she's extending her unhealthy relationship with food to your children. Overfeeding them and getting them obese is harmful and sets them up for a lot of health problems down the line.", "theres a difference between fat acceptance and just plain not fucking caring about your health. your wife is doing your kids no favors here.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife can make whatever choices she wants for herself, but obese children have an extraordinarily difficult time becoming healthy adults.  Actively promoting unhealthy eating is akin to child abuse.", "NTA for trying to help your kids live a long healthy life.  It\u2019s don\u2019t in a tasteful non body shaming way.  If you all got on board it would be great but your wife has given up on herself, and is sabotaging it for everyone else.", "Being happy with one's body and letting your children consume unlimited sugar, processed foods, and thousands of extra calories are not one and the same. Your wife has an unhealthy relationship with food which is severe enough to be severe neglect in regards to your children's health.\n\nNTA and for the benefit of your children please stay the course with the changes you're making. Additionally, I'd have a meaningful conversation between you, your wife, and your children's pediatrician on this subject", "NTA. A healthy lifestyle can make a difference in your quality of life. While desserts taste good and make you feel good for a little while, they are also addictive and harmful if you are not careful. Plus if you get used to overeating in childhood, it opens the door for lots of health issues in adulthood, including diabetes and hypertension. As for Health at every size movement, it has done so much harm to people that experts are warning against it. If this causes issues in the family, maybe family therapy will help.", "NTA, your wife is, your kids could get sick if they don't lose weight so handling their portions is a good thing to do", "NTA- as someone who was overweight as a child and obese as an adult, there are so many things that weight affects. I\u2019m now in my 30s getting healthy so that my bones and joints last longer and I don\u2019t develop heart problems as people in my family tend to.\n\nI was 19 when my obese father had a stroke due to high blood pressure stemming from unhealthy diet. He had to relearn to do many things. That was a long year taking care of him. Luckily he made a recovery and was able to get into much better shape. When your kids are 19 do you want them caring for you or your wife because of a heart attack or stroke. \n\nThe fat acceptance movement started with good intentions but being overweight and obese has real consequences. Your wife is trying to do good by the kids but is hurting them in another way. Please be a parent and find a good balance for your kids. They don\u2019t need to go on crazy diets but health is important and unfortunately balanced eating and weight affect those.", "NTA. Many people are in denial about what proper portions should be, especially in the United States. It\u2019s easier on children if they have the opportunity to see and experience correct portions when they are young.  Your wife is unfortunately setting them up for a lifetime of disordered eating.

Unfortunately your wife is in deep denial, and I don\u2019t know if there is a way to help her see logic.", "I don't think your wife loves her body mate. Nobody who's happy in their own skin flips out at reasonable lifestyle adjustments. The body positivity movement like every movement has good points and bad points. Good point people shouldn't have to feel ashamed of themselves or ridiculed or attacked for being obese.\n\n Downside people can now fool themselves into thinking that being fat is healthy or good. \n\nAlso you do need to get your children's weight under control and give them a healthy start in life. Adults allowing themselves to get fat (guilty as charged here) is a lifestyle choice. Raising your kids obese is in my opinion neglect.", "NTA. As parents we're responsible for keeping our kids healthy, and that means educating them about food choices and portion sizes. You aren't enforcing a diet, simply education for the long term health of your children. It sounds like your wife is actually struggling to accept her weight and feels personally attacked by your suggestions.", "NTA I think its sweet you care but this system should have been in place before it got to this point. Im underweight and have struggled with eating most of my life and I wish my parents had noticed or cared enough. It literally just came out and they think im faking everything. Your kids need a healthy relationship with food and exercise and you are the best example to show them what that looks like. I agree with everyone reccomending a physician.

Your wife has disordered thinking around food. I applaud you wanting to get the food situation at your house fixed, but you'll have more success modeling this than trying to enforce a new regime. Start cooking meals for your family. Have cooked veggies and/or salad at every meal and fill your plate halfway with vegetables. Have maybe 1/4-1/2 c of starch/carbs per meal, and then healthy proteins. Make FRESH food that tastes good, not pre-packaged food from the freezer or boxed mixes. Even if you are the only one eating this way for the next YEAR I guarantee you the kids will notice and want to at least try it. Despite what your wife says no one actually wants to be obese and feels better hauling around 100+ lb that strains their joints and cardiovascular system.\n\nStop eating sugar yourself. Tell your kids (because this will be true!) that you feel better if you don't have a dessert after every meal. Tell them that your stomach and your mind feels better, and that you are sleeping better.\n\nAll this to say -- start with YOURSELF. Trying to change your kids right off the bat is just you looking for a fight, whether you realize it or not.", "NTA\n\nIt might be worth you and your wife visiting a nutritionist to discuss proper portion sizes as stomachs can shrink and expand based on the amounts we eat. If your wife wants to overeat then she is an adult and can make that choice but kids rely on their parents to educate them on healthy eating.\n\nAlso, a good rule is always 80/20 - lots of fresh fruit and veg/yoghurts/nuts and grains/rice and fish with the occasional chocolate/ice cream/pizza for balance.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t ever use the term diet for kids though. Just get them on the path of healthy eating and portion sizes (introduced slowly) and regular exercise and they will be fine.", "Nta but you need to put your foot down. She can be as unhealthy as she wants, she has full autonomy. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to be attracted to that mindset and look. You aren\u2019t a robot that she can just control. And you have zero say with the kids either? That\u2019s just crazy. You\u2019re going to end up blowing up one day.", "NTA, and actually i think you need to crack down harder on this. i personally was a fat kid, my parents were both fat themselves and always served me excessive portions and let me have whatever snack i wanted or craved. heading into my teenage years, i became incredibly self-conscious about my weight and inability to just \"eat healthy\" and lose weight the healthy way that i became anorexic. i do resent my parents for doing that to me.\n\nyou could cause your children to have binge eating disorders or restrictive eating disorders if you both carry this on. yes, dessert a couple times a week is completely fine but shouldn't be after every single meal and you should lower their portions. the problem is your children may be hungry at first because they're so used to having bigger portions, so you need to gently put this into action as soon as possible before they start taking matters into their own hands and resent you in the future.", "Your kids may just as well resent your wife forever for making them fat. This is a period of critical development.", "As someone who struggles her whole life with jer weight I would say guide them to eat better, don't teach them food is bad, teach them to eat better.

NTA", "NTA. Look up \"health at any size.\"\n\nIt's a movement within the fat acceptance circle promoting health regardless of appearance.\n\n...but that's still *health* at any size. You still need to be mindful of what you're eating and taking care of your body with some activity if you're able. Having said this, your wife is an adult and can eat as much as she wants. However, overfeeding kids, especially at such a young age is unfair to them.\n\nI don't envy you for having to have this conversation when she's clearly very sensitive about it (and I get it, I'm a big woman too) but you have to do right by your kids.", "NAH. This sounds like a miscommunication. I think making sure your kids eat healthily is important as long as they are still allowed to eat when they are hungry. Trying to restrict food can lead to disordered eating habits. Practicing portion control can be a good solution, as well as teaching mindful eating (only eating when you\u2019re hungry, stopping when you\u2019re no longer hungry vs stuffed, etc.)\n\nI think body positivity is a great thing! There is a chance that even with this change, your wife and kids will still be fat, and that\u2019s okay! Proper nutrition is vital, but it doesn\u2019t guarantee skinniness. Being skinny is not the same as being healthy, though. Look at someone like Lizzo, who is super active and eats well. Fat people can be healthy. The most important thing is to stay active and eat well, and be kind to each other.", "YTA\n\nYou have allowed your wife to behave this way.", "NTA isn't something that should be accepted. It causes joint pain, arthritis, and diabetes. I've had patients have to have their toes amputated due to uncontrolled diabetes. You need to visit your children's doctor. And make a game plan. I would follow up with a nutritionist. Also I would implement daily exercise. You don't have to put them in a gym. But going for walks and bike rides will help them lose weight. Their are also healthy desserts you can make. A bowl of no sugar whip cream and strawberries are delicious. Also as a \"milkshake\" I use 2 cups of greek strawberry yogurt , 1 chopped up banana or a a handful of strawberries (fresh or frozen), and a splash of milk........tastes just like a milkshake. It's gonna be a hard adjustment. So be patient. Food and dessert can be healthy and delicious. You just gotta make the switch. And also my milkshake recipe is a great snack and breakfast. And store brands are fine to use since name brand ingredients are more expensive", "There\u2019s a different way to approach this. You can be \u201coverweight\u201d and healthy and also be \u201cskinny\u201d and unhealthy. You can\u2019t necessarily tell just by looking at a person. Just from what you\u2019ve posed it sounds like your kids are developing unhealthy habits at an early age that can lead to extreme obesity and a lot of health problems from respiratory to cardiac to musculoskeletal. They need to be taught by a parent that healthy food choices along with portion control is important. They also need to learn they shouldn\u2019t eat dessert after every lunch and dinner.", "Honestly, I think the portion control is the least impactful thing you can do to regulate your diet. The biggest would be cutting out surgery, salty, and unhealthy fat food (healthy fats are things like olives, olive oil, avocados, etc.) which include your desserts. Desserts should be treats for birthdays or the occasional get together with friends. From a health standpoint, the amount of sugar y\u2019all are eating is not at all remotely healthy. While eating healthy portions is also important, eating food that\u2019s mostly vegetables, fruit, and whole grains are also extremely important.", "ESH except your BIL. You and your wife suck overall for allowing your kids to have such an unhealthy lifestyle, which will impact their long term health.

I recommend family counseling.", "YTA. If you want to make changes to how you eat, do so. You g children should be able to eat as much food, given it is healthy food, as they want. It is not healthy to strictly enforce portion control for young children when it comes to healthy balanced meals and snacks (unless there is an unusual medical issue). It sounds like you and your BIL are taking things to the extreme, and your kids are going to have a hard time adjusting for their stay (and will probably be hungry, which might put them off the other aspects of your BILs diet that might be positive). Talk to a dietitian or nutritionist if you do want to start making changes, but especially if you are still thinking about portion control for the kids.", "INFO: What does the children\u2019s physician say about this? Did you consult with them at any point before suggesting it?", "ESH. Controlling what people eat is unhealthy overall.  There is a difference between having healthy eating habits and making them rules.  We rarely have dessert, but it\u2019s not a rule.  Teaching healthy portion size is different than making portion size a rule.  If he\u2019s not allowing them to co tell their portions how do they know what is right for them and can lead to pigging out when they do have control of their food.

And we have three kids (11F, 9F, 8M). Me and my wife are going on a trip together in a few weeks and my BIL (my late brother\u2019s long term fianc\u00e9) would be looking after the kids while we were gone.\r  \n\r  \nNow for some context that will be relevant, mr and my eldest child are overweight, and my wife and our youngest two are obese. My wife loves her body as is and I love her no matter what, she really into something called \u201cthe fat acceptance movement\u201d, which makes her happy so i support but I know bearly anything about it. My BIL and his two kids are healthy and in shape.\r  \n\r  \nTwo days ago I went to my BIL\u2019s house to help set things up and go over his house rules. We set up a bunk bed in the spare room (it already had a bed but now it has three) and afterwards he made lunch and we sat down to talk. He went through some of the house rules he has that he would expect my kids to follow, and they were all really fair, things like cleaning up your own mess, keeping your room tidy, helping with chores around the house. These arnt rules he made up for my kids, they are the rules that is kids already follow.\r  \n\r  \nThen there was the food rule, my BIL says that he controls the kids portions and how many snacks he gets them, but he had no control over food and snacks the kids buy themselves using allowance. I asked if I could join them for dinner so I could see and he said year. He served dinner and I immediately saw the difference between the food he makes and what my wife makes. I then saw his kids serve their own portions and were about half the size and what me and our kids would have and a third of what my wife would have. And I\u2019m not saying my BIL isn\u2019t feeding his kids properly, I\u2019m just pointing out the difference. I also found out that they only have desert a few times a week and only after dinner, while my wife will serve desert after every meal that isn\u2019t breakfast.\r  \n\r  \nI honestly really liked how my BIL handled food with his kids and was thinking to possibly imploring soemthing similar in our house after the trip if our kids adjusted well to it. Anyway I went home and was explaining the rules to my wife and then we got to the one about food and she flipped out.

Second, something is definitely going on with your wife.  If your wife wants to be fat and proud, then great for her.  She\u2019s an adult, she can make that choice.  It\u2019s different with children.  Children who are overweight and obese are at risk for serious health problems as adults, as well as eating disorders.
