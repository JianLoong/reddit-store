He's built his entire self-worth around how much money he makes - something that is entirely external and can be taken away from him at any time. He's clinging to this because it's the only thing he feels he has, he still has no sense of internal self-worth which is why he is being so arrogant - he has a reason to tell himself that he's great, so if he keeps saying it out loud and finds a way to be better than other people, he might feel better about himself.", "NTA, Mark sounds exhausting.", "NTA but I think you have outgrown this friendship.", ">He used to have self-esteem issues\n\nUh, and you're taking this new behavior as evidence that has changed? Sounds more like doubling down on low self-esteem to me.  NTA", "NTA. Mark doesn\u2019t seem like a real friend. He\u2019s using his experience to belittle you in every way that he can. Seems like he was envious of everyone around him but now as he feels like he has what they have (confidence, a good job) he\u2019s talking shit every chance he gets.

For Mark it has shown how much of a prick he is.", "NTA, he still has self esteem issues, maybe of another kind like imposter syndrome or something, which could make him feel the need to be loud about his achievements to maybe get the validation that he deserves them. But man I get you there, there\u2019s very few things more annoying than someone going on and on about how much they make, how much they have, how much better than everyone they are. \n\nSo I don\u2019t blame you for calling him out, as a matter of fact, that\u2019s what good friends do, call each other out when they\u2019re being dicks. You didn\u2019t say \u00ab\u00a0I wish you still had self esteem issues\u00a0\u00bb you said that he was full of himself.

( not mentioning self esteem) \n\nHad you have said to him \u201cI like you better with with self esteem issues\u201d would have been e s h.\n\nSounds like this guy needs reigning in a little. Perhaps a polite follow up conversation aside would be beneficial in knowing what your future friendship might look like.", "ESH. You for telling a person who has issues that you liked him better when he had the issues. Him for being so full of himself. He clearly does not know how to deal with his good luck.

Ideally, loving relationships aren\u2019t about  who is better?

He needs to grow up and realize that there are great accomplishments out there and he should be proud of his friends for getting those accomplishments. However, I also think you're a *very soft* YTA because of the way you stated that. I'm sure you didn't mean that you want him to go back to being low self esteem, but it comes across that low self esteem him was better. I'm sure I don't need to tell you how bad low self esteem is for people and what problems it can cause. You're not an asshole for thinking he's an asshole, just for the wording that you used. I'd suggest just outright telling him \"hey,you're being an asshole by acting like you're better than everyone else because of your situation. Not everyone has the same circumstances or chances as you and one of these days you're going to say it to the wrong person and make them have the same self esteem that you used to have because they think they aren't good enough when they're trying their best.\"", "Agree 100%.  People with good, healthy self-esteem don't engage in constant self promotion (I.e., talking about how much money they make, how intelligent they are, how successful they are, etc.).  Your friend is actually very insecure, and if he had decent self-awareness, he would have continued therapy after he got his new job.", "Yeah time to cancel Mark.", "Everyone has issues.
