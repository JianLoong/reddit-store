I have also told them no sharing with Adam and any gifts we unwrap at grandma\u2019s goes straight to the car and locked in. \nThe situation pisses me off because I now feel like I have to punish my kids for Adam\u2019s behavior and they can\u2019t play with their own things on Christmas and be vigilant because their cousin steals and no one but me seems to give two shits about how wrong that is.", "created_utc": 1703016433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mb4kf/aita_for_banning_my_teenage_nephew_from_my_house/", "score": 3044, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She had taken a bracelet from her 4-5yo cousin. She said, \"Look what ____ gave me.\" I said, \"Oh that was sweet of her.\" 15 minutes later, my cousin called, asking if we had seen her daughter's bracelet. I was LIVID. We went back to my cousin's, my daughter apologized, and I explained that we do NOT steal from others, especially family. I told her it is mean, and wrong. She felt awful, and she never stole anything else afterwards. You have to call your kids out, and teach them correctly. \n\nNTA.

It made family gatherings uncomfortable.   Sadly, we found out too late she had a serious drug problem, and she did commit suicide. She stole everything so she could fund the bad habit she created.

They need to learn at some stage that not everybody can be trusted, even relatives.\n\nAnd don't be shy at reminding people that the reason you're putting your kids' new presents in the car is to protect them from \"mistakes\". More accurately, to prevent them from being stolen. If the family don't like your honesty, they can deal with the thief properly.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not mistakes it is knowingly stealing other people\u2019s property.  Do on a few years time when it escalates to car theft or similar it is still a mistake?

It\u2019s not a mistake when it\u2019s repeated.\u201d \n\nMom - \u201cyou are being unfair to your nephew\u201d \nYou - \u201cno, I\u2019m being cautious/defensive around a known thief. Who has repeatedly stolen things and continues to steal things.\u201d \n\nYou could even go so low as to say \u201cit\u2019s one thing for a 13yo to make mistakes but it\u2019s disappointing when the adults around him to continuously enable his behavior. He might not know better but you should, and you should hold him accountable for it.\u201d \n\nRepeatedly call the spade a spade, say it so many times, directly, that your mother and sister already know what your response will be if they try to dismiss his behavior.

Clink clink!", "NTA.  It's way past time that this came to a head.  Adam is stealing, ***PERIOD***.  These aren't \"little mistakes.\"  He's not accidentally somehow taking things.  As you say, there's no way he could have mistaken a girlie pink donut case for his own (probably plain) one.    \n\n\nYour sister is crippling him by not addressing this issue head on.   It wouldn't surprise me at all if he's been shoplifting as well. Which means that he will, sooner or later, get caught by someone other than family.  You either all address it now, as a family, or he gets a juvenile record.  Is that what she wants?  I think I'd just flat out ask her that.", "Nta Adam has a theft problem, your sister should take him at a therapist.", "NTA\n\nAdam is a thief and it needs dealing with. At his age he knows very well right from wrong. \n\nUnfortunately your family's attitude will mean that eventually the people who deal with him will be people who won't care about him being family and will just go to the police. He deserves better parenting.", "OP - The sad part of this is because they excuse his behavior now, they're hurting him in the long run, and it'll enable this behavior to continue until police end up arresting him for robbery. No excuses will be given at that point that will help him. You're right to keep him away from your house and children's stuff, at 13 he knows right from wrong, but it seems his parents don't want to address that issue, so it'll be on them when he gets arrested.", "NTA, Adam needs therapy for Kleptomania. You\u2019ll be a hero for insisting he gets help if the therapy makes progress before he turns 18", "At 13 these are no longer \"mistakes\" they are theft.  A \"mistake\" would be grabbing a pair of similar shoes that were one size too large from a pile of them.  A \"mistake\" is not taking something that clearly doesn't belong to you... repeatedly.  \n\nI would be a bit meaner than you.  I'd buy or build some kind of locking box and take it into the house for your kids gifts and when it is commented on blithely respond that it will prevent you from having to scour the house looking for your items after they mistakenly end up somewhere other than where your family left them when it's time to leave.  \ud83e\udd23", "NTA.

You mom especially just wants it all brushed under the carpet because she just wants all her family around, and your response of punishing your own kids is allowing her to do this as well.\n\nAnd sorry OP but you are basically punishing just your kids and nobody else. Your mom gets what she wants. Your sister gets what she wants. Your nephew gets what he wants. Your children get punished. That's why YTA.\n\nYour mom needs to make a choice. Either your sister punishes her son properly so that he stops stealing and agrees with you that it is not just a mistake, or you don't turn up at all.\n\nHave Christmas at your own house, or go to your partner's family. Just keep them away from your mom. And if your mom asks why then tell her it is because SHE is enabling a thief to take from your children. Make it about her choice not about your nephew. Worst case scenario your kids still get to play with their own presents on Christmas day.

It wasn't cheap, and I worked my ass off for it. I was staying with my sister for a short time before moving to my new hometown, and my girlfriend and her kids had come over the day before for a BBQ. At that BBQ were friends of my BIL, and their Down's Syndrome son. \n\nThis kid could be very nice...but he was also very petty and vindictive if he didn't get his way. He'd thrown his brother's Walkman in the toilet a few days previously because he'd been told not to touch it. That type of thing...\n\nMy girlfriend's kids were using my iPod, and when they left, they'd put it on the charger in my bedroom. That night, I went to use it, and it was gone. I tore the house apart looking for it, and nothing. I called my girlfriend, who drove back to help me look, and nothing. She questioned her kids, and nothing. \n\nMy asshole of a BIL flat-out said \"one of your girlfriend's kids must have it\".\n\nI went to work the next morning without it. When I got home, my BIL wouldn't speak to me, and I had no idea why. I went up to my room, and found the iPod on it's charger. I went back down and asked where if had been found, and my BIL got up and stormed out of the room. My sister, amused to no end, told me that the kid had snuck upstairs and taken it, angry that I hadn't let him use it earlier that day. He then told his parents that I'd given it to him. To her credit, the mom didn't believe that, and called my sister to ask.\n\nMy sister made my BIL drive 45 minutes each way to pick it up, which explained his annoyance. He later apologized for accusing my girlfriend's kids, which also explained his annoyance.\n\nAfter that, I never let any of my things out of my sight when that kid was in the house. \n\nNTA.

If he consistently does better, over a longer period of time, that's a good thing.", "This is the argument predators make when someone calls them out for looking at underage girls. It's gross and holds no water. He certainly needs to be held accountable, but he's not an adult at all", "By \"mistake\" no doubt.", "Then get him treatment, but don't expect others to suffer for it.", "And like other sicknesses there are treatment programs to improve your condition. \n\nOP seems to be the only person in this narrative invested in finding any sort of treatment.", "Yes, it is. But a kid that steals without consequences, whether or not they have a disorder, won't learn to not steal other people things. However, a trained medical professional can make a diagnosis of a sickness, not random Redditors who haven't even met the child.", "Yes, but those behaviors are still reinforced if the kid never gets consequences for their actions, regardless of mental disorder", "Boomers grew up in a time of unequalled economic and agricultural prosperity. For the twenty years between 1946 and 1965, there were few to no major droughts, famines or geological disasters, and, if they made the effort to look, people were usually able to find *some* kind of work.  People aged twenty or under in 1965 very rarely experienced severe food shortage or starvation except in cases of parental/guardian abuse, and only experienced homelessness as a by-product of mental illness and/or parental neglect or abuse. Consequently they simply *do not understand* a lot of the current social problems because *they have no context for them*. When in your formative years everyone had a job if they simply went out and looked for one, it can be really hard to get that suddenly *the jobs aren't there*. And so on.", "I can empathize with decent people who are having their belongings taken from them wrongfully. I find it hard to empathize with a person who takes what belongs to another person. If you find yourself empathizing more with the bad guy much more than the people who are wronged by the bad guy, you might have some issues you need to work on.", "This is also my favorite way to correct/confront adults.\n\n\"Bro, I know you're not an asshole, alright? But you're really acting like one right now\"", "Yup. And if you can portray it as both of you on the same side fighting against the problem the better.", "A mistake, up until he takes Mom's car one day, prior to getting his license...", "The problem here is OP's family is absolutely refusing to even acknowledge that Adam is stealing toys he wants.  There's no reason he should be doing that by his teenage years.  \n\nI agree they shouldn't call him a thief.  But they should have consistently enforced consequences on Adam for his stealing.  And none of them are doing this.", "Aaaand this is the reason why it was not corrected in the first place because HE IS A CHILD. The grandmother and his mother considers this as a little mistake because he is a child. If he is treated like a teenager and being taught that his actions won't be tolerated anymore since is NOT SO YOUNG anymore then perhaps things could change, no? \n\nWhen you were 13, did you see yourself as a child? Or did you think that you have grown up since you are already a teenager? \n\nAt 13, do you want adults to treat yourself like a child? Coddle you like a child? At 13 they enter a phase called indentity crisis, conflicts such as peer pressure and they get confused whether they are still a child or a teenager gearing up to be an adult.", "That's just a myth, our brains are continuously developing though of course the biggest changes happen when we are young.", "As a middle school teacher, this is one of the most useful ways to start a discussion like this because (almost) no one actively *wants* to be an asshole, but we all do asshole things sometimes.", "This is so good. I'm gonna try and remember it.", "I say this to my older kids. I know you\u2019re not an asshole but you sure are acting like one. By this point I have tried \u201cdo you realize you have an attitude!?\u201d", "Adam is a fuckin thief though. This ain\u2019t a one off.", "Stealing is often symptomatic of molestation.  SA counselors sometimes ask WHEN a victim started stealing, not IF they stole.  A molested child has been taught that they don\u2019t even own their body, so ownership of things becomes rather nebulous as well.  Maybe someone should address why the child is stealing.", "Agree\n\n\"The grandmother and his mother considers this as a little mistake because he is a child.\" is key to why it continues. Easy way for them to rationalize not dealing with it. \n\nAt 13 he should already know it's wrong and be reprimanded for it which obviously isn't being done.", "You're supposed to educate a child and correct their behaviour, not make excuses for them, whether they're 3 years old or 13 years old. It shouldn't have been tolerated in the first place, before he even became a teenager (who is still a child).", "Two things can be true at once. A teenager is a child whose brain is still developing AND (assuming typical development) is old enough to be treated differently and with more serious consequences than a 5yo or 10yo.", "He's not being treated like a child he's being treated like an entitled baby, treating him like a child would be allowing the natural consequences of his behaviour, the loss of trust, and holding boundaries with him to prevent the behaviour and correct it. Punishment doesn't actually teach much. Most people, including adults, learn best through firm and loving support and guidance.", "I think the point the other poster is trying to support is that you need to address the behavior without reporting to labeling the child a thief. Instead,  the aim is to label the behavior as theft.   It may seem academic,  but there is power in it.   I'm not entirely in agreement; while I hope not everyone will call him a thief,  I hope someone who matters to him will.  That could let him know that when you steal stuff,  or even \"accidentally\" wander off and people inevitably catch you,  they will think you a thief,  and treat you accordingly.  There's value in seeing past the label,  but the shock of hearing it applied,  even once,  might help this kid to recognize the social cost of his choices.  \n\nThat said,  I think mom should consider a very strict policy to deal with this.  Something like,  \"every time you are going with someone else's stuff,  no matter if you forgot,  it will cost you twice the value of that item in allowance,  and you're giving it back with an apology. \"  If it's both expensive and humiliating,  I'll bet the \"mistakes \" would stop in a hurry.", "I'm just picturing you saying these exact words to your middle schoolers now \ud83d\ude02"]}
