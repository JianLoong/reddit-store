John was a widower with a son who is now 21 and a daughter who is now 19. John's late wife's family was still a strong presence in the lives of their grandchildren when Alicia met John and it was discussed, and made clear, that John's son and daughter with his wife were their grandchildren and any future children from John and Alicia would not be regarded as such and would not be entitled to anything from them, the former in-law's. John's children also shared their perspective that they would not consider any half siblings the same as they considered their full sibling and they wouldn't try to share traditions from their maternal family with any half siblings.\n\nI remember my parents and brother (42m) raising concerns with Alicia about her decision to marry into the family with that information. She has always held the view that things change and also that families can never have too many people, especially if she's involved. Nobody can be liked by everyone but Alicia has always held the belief that people should want her around. We all told her at the time that we hoped she was aware of what she was signing up for and she dismissed us.\n\nNow Alicia has three children with John and those kids are now 10, 9 and 7. True to their word, John's in-law's from his first marriage do not consider my nieces and nephew as grandkids and they are not included in their family functions. And John's older children have next to no relationship with their half siblings. I'm not entirely sure on all the details on this but my sister is not happy.\n\nAlicia's complaints are that her kids are excluded and have never been welcome by John's in-law's. That her stepkids have never changed their stance since that conversation and do not treat my nieces and nephew as siblings. That things she considers small, like being included in some kind of book, are denied to her children. It has hurt the children to see their older siblings enjoy this very close family dynamic and not be a part of it. Alicia is enraged by this. She ranted and raved about it and there are things I could not keep up with. But everything she was warned about by our parents, brother and me are now very big issues for her.\n\nThis is where I might be TA. I brought up to Alicia that she knew what she was getting into when she married John and that she had been warned by all of our family to reflect and see if it was what she wanted. I told her she doesn't get to be mad now when everyone laid their intentions out early. I said she can be disappointed things didn't change. But ultimately she made choices and every choice has a consequence, be it a good or bad one. She accused me of holding her accountable for the shitty behavior of others and said nobody would assume people could be so cold hearted or that kids could hold such strong views from such a young age. She said I was being cruelly unfair to her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692604495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x0vy3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_knew_what_she_was/", "score": 1468, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her parents are probably the only thing that gives them a sense of her presence and they didn\u2019t want to let their time be ruined with the reality that she\u2019s not coming back and dad has a new wife and kids.

She cannot be mad that things are exactly how they where laid out to her in advance", "NTA. The way things are, Alicia should be talking to her kids and normalizing this unique family dynamic that they have.

This wasn\u2019t intentional on anyone\u2019s part but my BIL new partner did not want us in their lives. I think when someone passes and leaves children it is very much up to the individual how relationships continue especially when new spouses and new children enter the mix. Your sister is wrong for expecting these people to open their lives to her children as they have no reason to do so. She should maybe be more empathetic to their views & as stated by previous posters make her own traditions for her family. As for the children not accepting their new half siblings I think that is down to her Husband to converse with them as they are now adults it would be a shame to not have some kind of relationship with siblings", "NTA.

But it's been a while so I can't say for sure.\n\nEither way, you are NTA, your sister really needs her eyes opened.

It's the harsh truth but it sounds like there is more to the story surrounding John.\n\nHe doesn't seem to have a good relationship with the kids and perhaps didn't even when their mother was still alive.\n\nThe kids grandparents have no obligation to your sisters kids.  They are not related to them in any, way, shape or form... which means they owe them nothing, especially not a relationship.  \n\nIt doesn't sound like John had that much of a relationship with the inlaws because he hasn't had much to do with them.\n\nJohn's kids have some genetic connection to your sisters kids but they aren't interested in a relationship.  That's their choice and they are free to make it no matter how much it sucks.\n\nNone of this is your fault.", "NTA\n\nI just love the way it reads:\"John in-law's\", nowadays, should be your family and parents. The former in-laws should not be in any way part of the picture for your sister. The thing is that it reads like they're stranded from your family but the former in-laws are a constant fixture in their lives... If that's the case, it's ESH. If it's not like that, your sister should stop feeling like the center of the universe.\n\nThe first kids thing is weird tho. Given the 20 years gap with their half-siblings it makes sense they aren't really close with them. But they seem too cold.", "I actually blame John here and she is right to some respect the in-laws promoted the behaviour that their half siblings aren\u2019t not considered family and that should have been nipped in the bud years ago by John.", "NTA. You're right, she can be disappointed that things didn't change.\n\nThe older kids have clearly been influenced by their maternal grandparents. It's completely fine if the in-laws don't view the new kids as their grandkids because they're not. It's their choice whether they want to involve others in the family functions. But it doesn't seem like they've even let the kids to get to know each other and make up their own minds about having a relationship. That's what's bizarre about this whole situation.", "INFO: Wait, okay, so the late wife's family doesn't want the new family around, and the kids are too old to consider new kids true siblings. I mean, I get it, but what did they expect, that John remains sad and alone for all eternity? Complicated stance, but fine, whatever.\n\nHow much does that affect the kids though? You say the new wife and their kids aren't invited to family functions. But how often do they go to those? There are two other families involved, how much holiday time do they get? Does Alicia's family include the kids from the previous marriage? Do they make their own traditions and books and such?", "YTA. Do YOU even love your sister? Because telling someone you love, who is reaching out to vent and maybe get a little bit of sympathy from you the equivalent of \u201cI told you so\u201d and \u201cyou made your bed, now lie in it\u201d, makes you an asshole. You may be right, I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong, but you\u2019re an asshole. Especially when it\u2019s something as serious as marriage and child raising. Especially especially when your sister is feeling alienated by people she obviously cares very much for, to begin with. You could have chosen to offer comfort, or even productive advice.

He was a great kid but the age gap was large and it seems larger when you are a kid.", "I think the difference is what you consider your \"family\".\n\nTo me, barring exceptions where someone is mentally or physically dangerous to be around, \"family\" is your blood family plus people you choose to make family, e.g. step children, foster children, really good friends and so on.\n\nBut you don't get to force others to consider your chosen family, their chosen family. You can't force step siblings to emotionally consider each other family because the two adults decided to get married, you can only expect politeness within the household. Other peoples emotions aren't yours to dictate.\n\nIt is absolutely the default that former in-laws through a now deceased spouse *aren't* family to children born with a new partner. They have zero blood relation to those children, and had no power in the decision of their deceased child's partner remarrying and having more children, so it's not chosen family for them either. \n\nAny former in-laws through a deceased spouse who do embrace new children with a new partner as their grandchildren aren't the default, they are incredible. They would be choosing to make unrelated children who would they would not know if their own child was still alive, their chosen family, and that is huge.\n\nIt's also not unfair to the new children that their half/step siblings grandparents are not their grandparents, because *they have two living parents while their half/step siblings do not*.", "Might be this huge age gap.", "That may be sad for the younger siblings, but it's the decision of the older ones. 21 year-old university-aged people have very little in common with 7 year-old children. If the relationship was 100% decided on by the older siblings, then that's their choice which they're free to make, and it should be respected regardless how uncomfortable it may make the others feel.

It also sounded a bit like they objected to the new marriage in general to me, which is why I asked and didn't judge. I'd especially like to know how much time they claim for their exclusive family.

Alicia was naive, which doesn't make her an AH. OP was honest and direct about something she probably should've foreseen. In this case, that doesn't make them an AH.

But on the other hand, it seems like they hog a lot of special time with only part of the family. That really isn't fair to the younger kids, by which I DO NOT mean they should stop. Alicia may have been naive, but I think *John* is not doing the right thing here. Step relationships are difficult to navigate, but he's making his own children second-class family if he constantly leaves them to celebrate his first family without any other events to balance this out. I don't even think he needs to dial back on the time he spends with his late wife's family, but he should take at least the same amount of time and effort to spend quality time with Alicia and their kids, without the others. That's not on Alicia. And I think you're pretty harsh with her.

She *was* informed and honestly, even if she wasn\u2019t, what possible right does she have to expect the parents of this dead woman to accept the new wife\u2019s children? They\u2019re not in any way related. They are not the grandparents to your sisters children, period. Their daughter *died*. Your sister is nothing to them, nor should she be.", "Absolutely NTA. Her husband's former in-laws are treating their grandchildren just like that, their grandchildren. They aren't related to Alicia's kids. I do have an issue with the oldest 2 not being closer to their younger siblings however since your sister seems to be pushing for a relationship with the oldest 2 maternal grandparents this could be their reaction to her behavior.", "NTA\n\nYour sister knew exactly what she was stepping into. The expectations were made abundantly clear from the very beginning. For her to be so hurt is absolutely ridiculous.", "They aren\u2019t Johns parents. Does your sister not understand that?\nBTW- NTA.", "Its unreasonable to expect John's inlaws (from his first wife)  to be a part of children that dont have ANY blood connection to.  John at this point is still their son in law but the new children he has with alicia are not their family.\n\nWhy doesnt alicia focus on building relationship and family traditions with John's family (her own inlaws) and her own parents rather than being angry about these people?  NTA", "Im guessing the unspoken subtext here is that the in-law family are very wealthy. Explains everyones actions. The relationship with Johns parents is never mentioned. Only the in laws family who basically outlined a \"prenup\".", "I\u2019m having trouble seeing why this is such a huge deal too\u2026they\u2019re John\u2019s in-laws\u2026the parents of his *former wife*\u2026OP\u2019s sister\u2019s kids are not related to them. Why so hung up on this? Don\u2019t they have John\u2019s parents and the rest of his bio family? Are these people rich or something and OP\u2019s sister expected money and gifts for her children from them?\n\nJust because your kid marries someone\u2026means you have to always involve their future kids in all their following relationships their whole lives? And their kids\u2019 kids? Like where does it stop? They were upfront with her and now she\u2019s mad that\u2026exactly what they said was going to happen is happening. NTA.", "Yeah I don't understand this especially since the kids of the first wife are now adults. I could understand if they were all children that it would make the situation more delicate and complicated like around holidays, but... yeah.", "I agree that OP is NTA, but man those grandparents are.  Family isn't just blood related.  The new children are now part of the family.  I'm not saying that everyone gets treated exactly the same but to completely not include the younger kids in anything is rude and hurtful.  It also encourages the older kids to exclude the younger ones.  These kids are going to be family for the rest of their lives, everyone should be focused on building stable relationships.", "As a 20 year old with a 7 and 8 year old half siblings I can say that it just depends on the individual, you just can\u2019t force certain things. I love my baby brothers and I consider them my full siblings despite having different fathers, although I\u2019d describe our relationship more of like a \u201csecond mother and child\u201d given the big age gap. And given the fact that I\u2019m away for college I don\u2019t see them too often :(", "Honestly, I think OP overemphasized the in-law part to bolster her story.  Without that, it'd be yet another story of a step-parent heartbroken that their blended family doesn't look like *The Brady Bunch*.  I am very suspicious of the idea that the main problem is her children only having two sets of grandparents to choose from on weekends and holidays rather than siblings being treated like pests on a daily basis (which, honestly, can happen even in a non-blended family).", "Yah, tbf I find it a little shitty the older half siblings aren\u2019t involved with the younger at all. But maybe they just don\u2019t like kids and will be more involved later? Even half siblings are siblings imo, I would expect some kind of relationship there even if minor\u2026", "That was my thought. The prior wife's family has money", "This is my question too. If OPs family is involved with the kids, it should be very easy to explain to the kids that the 1/2 sibs do some stuff with their mom\u2019s family, we do our own things with my (A\u2019s) family, and we all do things with dad\u2019s family. Assuming his family is involved with all kids.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t blame the 1/2 sibs due to the age gap but also, now their inheritance from dad will be 20% or less vs 50% each bc A had to go and have 3 more kids.", "I think BIL can't escape this. He brought the younger kids into the world without first making sure his kids wouldn't resent them. He set up the younger kids to have elder siblings not want anything to do with them. That's shitty. The in Laws are fine though.", "Basically, Alicia heard what they said, decided not to believe them and spent a decade trying to force them to *change* because she thought they should. \n\nIt\u2019s sus to me that the older kids said they\u2019d never treat her kids like \u201cfull siblings\u201d but now they have almost nothing to do with them. I\u2019d bet money that Alicia\u2019s been pushing her fantasy narrative (the one she made up instead of believing what people told her) to the degree that she\u2019s pushed those kids so far away they don\u2019t give a shit about her or her kids. \n\nShe *could have* fostered a respectfully and caring relationship with everyone in her family. She could have taught her kids that families are varied and interesting and they have you guys while their half siblings have their mom\u2019s family\u2026 but instead, she burnt everything down and made herself miserable because the story she thinks in her head is more important and true than what other human beings tell her. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d I was you everything the rant comes up I\u2019d shut it down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that but I\u2019d rather not be the one you vent to about this. <insert topic change >\u201d and I\u2019d cut the conversation off every time. \n\nNTA. She did this to herself by thinking she\u2019s more important and special than everyone else. Fucked around, you don\u2019t need to listen to her bitching about finding out.", "INFO: does she expect your parents to act like grandparents to the older kids?  I hope not, because that would be a perfect example that might get through to her more.\n\nAlso you\u2019re definitely NTA, she needs to stop whining about the consequences of her own actions.", "From personal experience, I had a step-brother, and his grandparents were neither related to me by blood nor were they my step-grandparents. Given this lack of any direct relationship, even at the age of five I never once held the expectation that they would include me in their family gatherings or treat me as one of their own. And, to be perfectly honest, I preferred it that way. It made sense to me that they focused on their biological grandchildren. Why would they extend the same familial affections to someone with whom they have neither a blood nor legal familial connection? NTA", "It's not too late for Alicia to make new traditions! All you have to do is celebrate something twice and \"tada!\", new tradition.\n\nI do feel for her, it's been 11 years and it's pretty intense to harden your heart to children like that. My in-laws were actively against our marriage and now 10 years later, they're doting and a little smother-y. \n\n\nWhere's her husband in all of this? He should be a buffer and actively working to create a positive family environment. It might not be the family that Alicia wants, but it shouldn't be so cold.", "Have you thought about what traditions your family has or can have, for your sister\u2019s children to be part of?\n\nBecause with respect to those kids, John\u2019s in-laws aren\u2019t his late wife\u2019s family \u2014 they\u2019re you and your family. You doing something is not going to cure your sister of her \u201coh I\u2019m sure everyone will love me\u201d attitude and pushiness, but it may provide something special for her kids to be part of.", "Do Alicia's kids have as strong a relationship with your parents as John's kids do with their grandparents?", "Exactly. My half brother was nine years older than me. We were raised together full time (his dad wasn't in the picture) and we still were never close.", "But they\u2019re not the grandparents of the 3 younger grandchildren. They\u2019re the parents of John\u2019s deceased wife. \n\nWhy should there be any obligation for them to be involved in the lives of his children with his new wife, who they are in no way related to?", "I don't really see it like that. It was OP's sister's and BIL's job to explain to the younger children that their siblings have a different family and to create an atmosphere where they didn't feel excluded. They could have had their own little party whenever the older kids went to the grandparents. Young kids aren't that hard to please, an afternoon playing football at the park and a bit of pizza would have made them happy and taken their minds off of their siblings being away. Plus, from OP's comments, it would seem that the older kids had an issue with the marriage from the beginning so it was unlikely that they'd ever want to have a relationship with any children from their step-mother/father's relationship.", "You\u2019re NTA.\n\nThe grandparents have 0 obligations to Alicia\u2019s children and never ever have to lay eyes on them if they so choose. \n\nHowever, if they are influencing the half-siblings into not wanting a relationship with the younger kids then that is an issue the dad needs to deal with.", "Do john's parents, not just his late wife's parents, also not see his wife and new children as family? are john's parents even in the picture? it's not exactly clear to me.", "Because the ex's family has a very tight unit. Imagine Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc when the older kids always go to the other family. \n\nIt wouldn't hurt the grandparents to invite the half sibs to parties sometimes. Even if not as grandchildren, but as guests. It is simply the kind thing to do. \n\nMy sister spends the Christmas holidays with us every year. When people invite us over, we say sorry, but we have a guest. Either they invite us to bring the guest (which is usual) or we would stay home. In this case I would not invite half of the kids to a celebration and leave the others out only to hear later about how amazing the party was. This is what is happening in this family on a regular basis. It is shameful.\n\nThe father is allowing his ex's parents to break up his own family celebrations so they  can take \"their\" kids away. Dad should insist on their own family time. OP says that the older kids hardly know the younger ones. So it is not just special days, they seem to spend a lot of time with these kids.", "It might be different if the other kids were close to their step siblings.

I always just call them and my brother and sister and have always been close to them. Meanwhile, I'm not close with my \"full\" sibling, who is 1.5 years younger than me. Everyone's different I guess.", "When my wife and I had temporary custody of my niece (daughter of my half sister on my mom's side) my in laws as well as my dad and stepmom included her or offered to include her in everything that we did as a family.  You can choose to say \"They're not family so we don't care about them.\"  Or you can say \"They're a part of our extended family so we're going to include them a) because they're kids and b) because we want everyone to have a good relationship.\"  \n\nI'm not saying the grandparents need to set up college funds for these kids.  But they're excluding them and their behavior is encouraging the older kids to exclude the younger kids as well.  It's a way to approach the situation IMO.", "I'm just saying that it's an unfortunate situation.  I would choose to lean towards the side of inclusion and encouraging everyone to have a relationship and get along.  This idea of \"they're not family so we're going to shut them out\" is, in my opinion, a shitty perspective to have.  They might not be blood related but they are part of your extended family.", "My age gap with my (half) siblings is larger than the age gap here. I\u2019m very close with them. It\u2019s a choice not to be part of their half siblings\u2019 lives. A valid choice. But a choice nonetheless. I don\u2019t think anyone can blame Alice or her kids for being upset that the kids don\u2019t have a sibling relationship. But. The kids also made their position very clear.

But I think it's easy to look in from the outside and think that you'd do this or do that but we're not all perfect and grief can take many forms. It seems as though the in laws in question are still grieving the loss of their daughter and they might not have the capacity for such a magnanimous response.", "It's not just on the mom here. The dad has a responsibility to bridge the gap between his kids, he is the father to both sets of kids.", "My best friend (Sister friend) have 6 kids and her older daughter (second born) absolutely **HATE** that she have siblings (full, not half).  When I say **HATE**, I mean, was a bully to them, telling them that she hate that they were ever born.  That she should have been the only one (even though her brother was born before her).  **Hate, hate, hate** that when she had her first born (s), her sister had her first born (d) a day after she did and then, years later, her younger brother and his fiance had their first born (s) on the same day and year that she delivered her second born (d).  Right to this day, she have very limited contact with her brothers and sisters unless she wants something from them.\n\nBefore anyone asks or make any negative comments, my Sister friend had her in therapy (several in fact) to no effect.

When my older BIL got remarried (and even before he got remarried) my MIL and FIL immediately began including the kids from his new wife's previous relationship in family events.  The kids from the previous relationship call them grandma and grandpa now.  My dad and step mom included my niece from my mom (my dad's ex wife's) side in family events when my wife and I had temporary custody of her.  My dad is under no obligation to do something nice for my mom or her family but he did anyways.  \n\nMy point is that you can choose to be inclusive or you can choose to not be inclusive.  You can choose to make things easy for everyone and build a bigger table or you can choose to just recognize the \"blood family\" and put up a taller fence.  I'm glad that in my family the choice has typically been to be more open rather than less open.", "I'd imagine it's because people see the older one as \"still a kid\" (which they of course are) and kind of lump them together with the younger one without actually factoring in developmental differences, as opposed to larger gaps where the older is Actually Adult-like themselves and Not a Child so is treated as more adult in the situation. And a smaller gap it's easier to remember the developmental differences between the kids?\n\nI'm just spitballing that of course, but it does track with my own experiences between myself, my brother, and my cousins.", "Yes, that\u2019s entirely possible.", ">Alice and her children are not related to to their father's deceased first wife's parents in any way. Not by blood, not by marriage, not at all. \n\nThis is true obviously, and this is a prevalent attitude on AITA. But for me, it misses the forest through the trees. The half siblings aren't random strangers somewhere out there on the far side of the planet... they do now have connections, a shared space and shared ties. Overlapping lives. The line is far more blurry than people are giving credit for.\n\nTo me, it feels incredibly harsh that the deceased wife's parents would come into this space that does have points of connections and vehemently start drawing lines and actively excluding members of a shared household... and then leaving and forcing the household to deal with the consequences. They are setting up a system where a father has to deal with very different treatment for two sets of kids.\n\nI get it, the grandparents don't legally owe anything to the halfsiblings. But human society works on much more than legal obligations. Would it kill them to send birthday cards for everyone's birthday? To allow them to family functions?

So as with many people when they find someone being pushy and trying to run over something important to them, they\u2019ve pulled back."]}
