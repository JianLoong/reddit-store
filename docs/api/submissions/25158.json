John was a widower with a son who is now 21 and a daughter who is now 19. John's late wife's family was still a strong presence in the lives of their grandchildren when Alicia met John and it was discussed, and made clear, that John's son and daughter with his wife were their grandchildren and any future children from John and Alicia would not be regarded as such and would not be entitled to anything from them, the former in-law's. John's children also shared their perspective that they would not consider any half siblings the same as they considered their full sibling and they wouldn't try to share traditions from their maternal family with any half siblings.\n\nI remember my parents and brother (42m) raising concerns with Alicia about her decision to marry into the family with that information. She has always held the view that things change and also that families can never have too many people, especially if she's involved. Nobody can be liked by everyone but Alicia has always held the belief that people should want her around. We all told her at the time that we hoped she was aware of what she was signing up for and she dismissed us.\n\nNow Alicia has three children with John and those kids are now 10, 9 and 7. True to their word, John's in-law's from his first marriage do not consider my nieces and nephew as grandkids and they are not included in their family functions. And John's older children have next to no relationship with their half siblings. I'm not entirely sure on all the details on this but my sister is not happy.\n\nAlicia's complaints are that her kids are excluded and have never been welcome by John's in-law's. That her stepkids have never changed their stance since that conversation and do not treat my nieces and nephew as siblings. That things she considers small, like being included in some kind of book, are denied to her children. It has hurt the children to see their older siblings enjoy this very close family dynamic and not be a part of it. Alicia is enraged by this. She ranted and raved about it and there are things I could not keep up with. But everything she was warned about by our parents, brother and me are now very big issues for her.\n\nThis is where I might be TA. I brought up to Alicia that she knew what she was getting into when she married John and that she had been warned by all of our family to reflect and see if it was what she wanted. I told her she doesn't get to be mad now when everyone laid their intentions out early. I said she can be disappointed things didn't change. But ultimately she made choices and every choice has a consequence, be it a good or bad one. She accused me of holding her accountable for the shitty behavior of others and said nobody would assume people could be so cold hearted or that kids could hold such strong views from such a young age. She said I was being cruelly unfair to her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692604495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x0vy3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_knew_what_she_was/", "score": 701, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her parents are probably the only thing that gives them a sense of her presence and they didn\u2019t want to let their time be ruined with the reality that she\u2019s not coming back and dad has a new wife and kids.

She cannot be mad that things are exactly how they where laid out to her in advance", "NTA. The way things are, Alicia should be talking to her kids and normalizing this unique family dynamic that they have.

I think when someone passes and leaves children it is very much up to the individual how relationships continue especially when new spouses and new children enter the mix. Your sister is wrong for expecting these people to open their lives to her children as they have no reason to do so. She should maybe be more empathetic to their views & as stated by previous posters make her own traditions for her family. As for the children not accepting their new half siblings I think that is down to her Husband to converse with them as they are now adults it would be a shame to not have some kind of relationship with siblings", "NTA.

It's the harsh truth but it sounds like there is more to the story surrounding John.\n\nHe doesn't seem to have a good relationship with the kids and perhaps didn't even when their mother was still alive.\n\nThe kids grandparents have no obligation to your sisters kids.  They are not related to them in any, way, shape or form... which means they owe them nothing, especially not a relationship.  \n\nIt doesn't sound like John had that much of a relationship with the inlaws because he hasn't had much to do with them.\n\nJohn's kids have some genetic connection to your sisters kids but they aren't interested in a relationship.  That's their choice and they are free to make it no matter how much it sucks.\n\nNone of this is your fault.", "NTA\n\nI just love the way it reads:\"John in-law's\", nowadays, should be your family and parents. The former in-laws should not be in any way part of the picture for your sister. The thing is that it reads like they're stranded from your family but the former in-laws are a constant fixture in their lives... If that's the case, it's ESH. If it's not like that, your sister should stop feeling like the center of the universe.\n\nThe first kids thing is weird tho. Given the 20 years gap with their half-siblings it makes sense they aren't really close with them. But they seem too cold.", "I actually blame John here and she is right to some respect the in-laws promoted the behaviour that their half siblings aren\u2019t not considered family and that should have been nipped in the bud years ago by John.", "NTA. You're right, she can be disappointed that things didn't change.\n\nThe older kids have clearly been influenced by their maternal grandparents. It's completely fine if the in-laws don't view the new kids as their grandkids because they're not. It's their choice whether they want to involve others in the family functions. But it doesn't seem like they've even let the kids to get to know each other and make up their own minds about having a relationship. That's what's bizarre about this whole situation.", "INFO: Wait, okay, so the late wife's family doesn't want the new family around, and the kids are too old to consider new kids true siblings. I mean, I get it, but what did they expect, that John remains sad and alone for all eternity? Complicated stance, but fine, whatever.\n\nHow much does that affect the kids though? You say the new wife and their kids aren't invited to family functions. But how often do they go to those? There are two other families involved, how much holiday time do they get? Does Alicia's family include the kids from the previous marriage? Do they make their own traditions and books and such?", "YTA. Do YOU even love your sister? Because telling someone you love, who is reaching out to vent and maybe get a little bit of sympathy from you the equivalent of \u201cI told you so\u201d and \u201cyou made your bed, now lie in it\u201d, makes you an asshole. You may be right, I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong, but you\u2019re an asshole. Especially when it\u2019s something as serious as marriage and child raising. Especially especially when your sister is feeling alienated by people she obviously cares very much for, to begin with. You could have chosen to offer comfort, or even productive advice.

He was a great kid but the age gap was large and it seems larger when you are a kid.", "I think the difference is what you consider your \"family\".\n\nTo me, barring exceptions where someone is mentally or physically dangerous to be around, \"family\" is your blood family plus people you choose to make family, e.g. step children, foster children, really good friends and so on.\n\nBut you don't get to force others to consider your chosen family, their chosen family. You can't force step siblings to emotionally consider each other family because the two adults decided to get married, you can only expect politeness within the household. Other peoples emotions aren't yours to dictate.\n\nIt is absolutely the default that former in-laws through a now deceased spouse *aren't* family to children born with a new partner. They have zero blood relation to those children, and had no power in the decision of their deceased child's partner remarrying and having more children, so it's not chosen family for them either. \n\nAny former in-laws through a deceased spouse who do embrace new children with a new partner as their grandchildren aren't the default, they are incredible. They would be choosing to make unrelated children who would they would not know if their own child was still alive, their chosen family, and that is huge.\n\nIt's also not unfair to the new children that their half/step siblings grandparents are not their grandparents, because *they have two living parents while their half/step siblings do not*.", "Might be this huge age gap.", "That may be sad for the younger siblings, but it's the decision of the older ones. 21 year-old university-aged people have very little in common with 7 year-old children. If the relationship was 100% decided on by the older siblings, then that's their choice which they're free to make, and it should be respected regardless how uncomfortable it may make the others feel.

Alicia was naive, which doesn't make her an AH. OP was honest and direct about something she probably should've foreseen. In this case, that doesn't make them an AH.

But on the other hand, it seems like they hog a lot of special time with only part of the family. That really isn't fair to the younger kids, by which I DO NOT mean they should stop. Alicia may have been naive, but I think *John* is not doing the right thing here. Step relationships are difficult to navigate, but he's making his own children second-class family if he constantly leaves them to celebrate his first family without any other events to balance this out. I don't even think he needs to dial back on the time he spends with his late wife's family, but he should take at least the same amount of time and effort to spend quality time with Alicia and their kids, without the others. That's not on Alicia. And I think you're pretty harsh with her.

Sometimes the kid never even met the person or only sees them at holidays. Kid never had a relationship with the person and wouldn't give a crap if it wasn't for the parent's would've should've could'ves that gets the imagination going. In the same house, there might be more wishful thinking, but really, if you treat a kid like a tertiary part of your life, the kid probably won't really like you anyway.", "And (I'm assuming due to sister's stated assumptions of reality) likely sister forcing kids to interact with babies and toddlers or minimally always trying to turn their attention that way and maybe telling them how to be big siblings and what it should mean to them rather than letting relationships grow from living in the same place.", "I\u2019m not saying they have to be bestest buddies.

The post doesn't say how long it had been since the first wife's death or what she died from.   Children who lose their parents suddenly may need more time for the grieving process because they weren't expecting it.  Unfortunately, parents don't often consider their child's feelings when it comes to bringing in new partners whether it be due to death or divorce.", "A *huge* age gap? The older kids are 21 and 19.

They were raised together.", ">the dad should have limited contact\n\nSo after they lost their mom they should've lose their grandparents too?? What an idiot thing to say. Why on earth makes you think that it would've been better for those kids to not see thejr grandparents anymore just because their dad remarried and had some more kids?? You think they would prefer staying with stepmother and her kids rather than with their grandparents??\n\n The victims here are the kids who lost their mom and their dad remarried a woman they don't like. And you wanted them to also lose their grandparents?? \n\n The dad should've put his foot down and defend his kids from his wife's expectations.", "As someone whose mom died, i can assure you that while i have a great relationship with my dad, if he marries someone else and has a bunch of kids, those kids won't be my siblings. They'll just be dad's kids with some woman who isn't my mother and i don't care about (this is hypotethical since dad had a vasectomy, but you get my point). Those kids wouldn't be my family, my family would still be my dad, my brother and dad's brother and sil with my cousins. \n\n The victims here aren't op's niblings, the victims are the kids who lost their mom and their dad remarried and had a bunch of kids with a woman they never wanted in their life.", "Children that likely wouldn't exist if their own child hadn't died.", "I feel like this is the part Alice isn't considering enough. Her husband's first wife isn't an ex, she's *dead*. It's not like the extended family gets time with her separately from Alice and Alice's kids and her husband is trying to play happy family with an ex, they're just being clear that Alice and her kids aren't a replacement somehow. I don't know if it's the healthiest solution in terms of grief processing, but it's been going on for 11 years, so at this point Alice needs to accept it as it is.       \n     \nEdit: to be 100% clear, in terms of the comment about grief processing, I'm mostly referring to Alice's step kids. I totally understand the former in-laws not having a relationship with Alice's bio kids, but it doesn't necessarily seem healthy to enable the step kids to have 0 relationship with their half siblings.

It was a concerted decision and had nothing to do with age gaps.", "It\u2019s not universally bad, that\u2019s absurd.

It's not like the extended family gets time with her separately from Alice and Alice's kids\n\nOK I'm not meaning to come across as aggressive here, but this is the part that I am just not getting.\n\nWhy are some commenters acting like former in-laws treating their child's former partner's new partner like family is a normal thing to do? \n\nWhat people do you know that have a divorced child and spend time with their former son/daughter in law and their new spouse separately and consider them family? If that happened people would make note of it, because it's noteworthy, because its not something that normally happens.\n\nAlice and her children *are not related to to their father's deceased first wife's parents in any way*. Not by blood, not by marriage, not at all. Why on earth would it be an unhealthy way to grieve to not spend time with some random unrelated people? Not spending time with Alice and her children isn't weird, it's the default, most often occurring way this scenario plays out.\n\nIf my dog died am I greiving in an unhealthy way if I don't spend time with my dog's parent's owners new dog unrelated to my deceased dog?", "Oh thanks to the purple hoopla i am not alone. For me, when someone refers to someone as that, my brain immediately goes to that creepy half goat half man in the Greek mythology (faun i think or satyr? not sure which it is) with their stupid pan flute, hopping on their hooves half drunk,  lurking around women..

Better for those kids to be with their grandparents than with stepmom and her kids. \n\nFyi, if my dad would remarry and have a kids with some women, i wouldn't think of those kids as my siblings either.

Jesus fucking christ...", ">How is a father remarrying a bad thing\n\nIt is when your kids are small, their mom died and you don't care that they aren't ready for you to push another woman down their throat.", "To be clear, when I personally said it seemed unhealthy, I was mostly referring to Alice's step kids who have half-siblings. Their grandparents and Alice's husband's in-laws at large definitely have no obligation to have a relationship with his younger kids. I definitely didn't clarify that enough, so I'm sorry about that.", "OK that makes a bit more sense.\n\nI do feel kinda, I don't know \"meh\" about the lack of sibling relationship though.\n\nI mean the most OP has said is the older kids were disinterested in their half siblings, and possibly have some bad feeling towards their dad (not the half siblings) for how the remarriage was handled.\n\nI'm not convinced that's unhealthy. With the age gap even if they were full siblings I wouldn't call the disinterest unhealthy.\n\nIf it was full siblings who were literal twins born within minutes of each other, and one was disinterested in having a close relationship, I wouldn't say that is automatically unhealthy. People don't get a choice in if their parents have more kids, and you can't force people to automatically have a close bond. Some people just don't click and if the worst that happens is disinterest, that's a win in my opinion. Some siblings hate each other and the household is a war zone for years until one of them leaves. Those parents are crying in how much they wish their kids were just disinterested in each other.\n\nAnd the older kids who in this post who may have bad feelings towards their dad for how he handled the remarriage, well that doesn't feel unhealthy or malicious to me either considering the new step mum's attitude. The bad feelings are directed towards the right person and not taken out on the younger half siblings who didn't choose to exist.", "Totally agree, on all of that. I guess I'm also coming at this from kind of a weird perspective because of my own background. My mom's family is a great example of a way that a divorce (not death, so a very different situation in that way to be fair) and re-marriage was handled poorly (imo, I wasn't alive for any of this). My granddad remarried and introduced his second wife as \"your new mother\" to my mom and her siblings. Which...obviously shitty, seeing as 1, my grandmother was still alive and had primary custody and 2, No.     \n    \nThat being said, he remarried again a couple more times, and my mom has half-siblings with a significant age gap (closer to me than to her age-wise) who she and her full siblings have varying relationships with but do still have a relationship with.      \n    \nTL;DR families are weird but if Alice wanted to somehow influence this or encourage a relationship between the siblings, the time is long past. Anything at this point will have to be between the various siblings as adults.", "Yeah I think the issue in this case and your mum's is its all about choice, or lack their of.\n\nBoth your grandad and Alice seem to want to take away choice and dictate how their children/step children should feel about other people. And in Alice's case, how her husband's deceased wife's parents should feel.\n\nLeft to their own choices, your mum and her full siblings did form relationships with much younger half siblings, but to varying degrees. I'm assuming to varying degrees due to how well their personalities do or do not naturally mesh, because all types of siblings are still just one human forming a relationship with another human."]}
