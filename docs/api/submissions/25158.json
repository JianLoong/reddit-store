John was a widower with a son who is now 21 and a daughter who is now 19. John's late wife's family was still a strong presence in the lives of their grandchildren when Alicia met John and it was discussed, and made clear, that John's son and daughter with his wife were their grandchildren and any future children from John and Alicia would not be regarded as such and would not be entitled to anything from them, the former in-law's. John's children also shared their perspective that they would not consider any half siblings the same as they considered their full sibling and they wouldn't try to share traditions from their maternal family with any half siblings.\n\nI remember my parents and brother (42m) raising concerns with Alicia about her decision to marry into the family with that information. She has always held the view that things change and also that families can never have too many people, especially if she's involved. Nobody can be liked by everyone but Alicia has always held the belief that people should want her around. We all told her at the time that we hoped she was aware of what she was signing up for and she dismissed us.\n\nNow Alicia has three children with John and those kids are now 10, 9 and 7. True to their word, John's in-law's from his first marriage do not consider my nieces and nephew as grandkids and they are not included in their family functions. And John's older children have next to no relationship with their half siblings. I'm not entirely sure on all the details on this but my sister is not happy.\n\nAlicia's complaints are that her kids are excluded and have never been welcome by John's in-law's. That her stepkids have never changed their stance since that conversation and do not treat my nieces and nephew as siblings. That things she considers small, like being included in some kind of book, are denied to her children. It has hurt the children to see their older siblings enjoy this very close family dynamic and not be a part of it. Alicia is enraged by this. She ranted and raved about it and there are things I could not keep up with. But everything she was warned about by our parents, brother and me are now very big issues for her.\n\nThis is where I might be TA. I brought up to Alicia that she knew what she was getting into when she married John and that she had been warned by all of our family to reflect and see if it was what she wanted. I told her she doesn't get to be mad now when everyone laid their intentions out early. I said she can be disappointed things didn't change. But ultimately she made choices and every choice has a consequence, be it a good or bad one. She accused me of holding her accountable for the shitty behavior of others and said nobody would assume people could be so cold hearted or that kids could hold such strong views from such a young age. She said I was being cruelly unfair to her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692604495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x0vy3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_knew_what_she_was/", "score": 3526, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think when someone passes and leaves children it is very much up to the individual how relationships continue especially when new spouses and new children enter the mix. Your sister is wrong for expecting these people to open their lives to her children as they have no reason to do so. She should maybe be more empathetic to their views & as stated by previous posters make her own traditions for her family.

If it's not like that, your sister should stop feeling like the center of the universe.\n\nThe first kids thing is weird tho. Given the 20 years gap with their half-siblings it makes sense they aren't really close with them. But they seem too cold.", "I actually blame John here and she is right to some respect the in-laws promoted the behaviour that their half siblings aren\u2019t not considered family and that should have been nipped in the bud years ago by John.", "NTA. You're right, she can be disappointed that things didn't change.\n\nThe older kids have clearly been influenced by their maternal grandparents. It's completely fine if the in-laws don't view the new kids as their grandkids because they're not. It's their choice whether they want to involve others in the family functions. But it doesn't seem like they've even let the kids to get to know each other and make up their own minds about having a relationship. That's what's bizarre about this whole situation.", "INFO: Wait, okay, so the late wife's family doesn't want the new family around, and the kids are too old to consider new kids true siblings. I mean, I get it, but what did they expect, that John remains sad and alone for all eternity? Complicated stance, but fine, whatever.\n\nHow much does that affect the kids though? You say the new wife and their kids aren't invited to family functions. But how often do they go to those? There are two other families involved, how much holiday time do they get? Does Alicia's family include the kids from the previous marriage? Do they make their own traditions and books and such?", "YTA. Do YOU even love your sister? Because telling someone you love, who is reaching out to vent and maybe get a little bit of sympathy from you the equivalent of \u201cI told you so\u201d and \u201cyou made your bed, now lie in it\u201d, makes you an asshole. You may be right, I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong, but you\u2019re an asshole. Especially when it\u2019s something as serious as marriage and child raising. Especially especially when your sister is feeling alienated by people she obviously cares very much for, to begin with. You could have chosen to offer comfort, or even productive advice. You decided to rub salt in the wound. Yeah, you\u2019re an asshole. Idk why the hell everyone else is telling you otherwise.\nETA: Thanks for all the downvotes. Real glad I\u2019m not related to any of you AH\u2019s. Nobody seems to get the point here. Were the sisters expectations of the situation entirely impractical? Partly. The ex in-law thing is definitely ridiculous. Expecting your kids siblings to give a damn about them however, is not. I don\u2019t get acting like it\u2019s just okay and normal for the older siblings to disregard the younger. Why? Because their mom died? Not the kids fault. If the sister had married someone abusive, someone with a reputation for being rough, would her family be telling her to just get over it? \u201cToo bad, sucks to be you, you knew how he was, not my problem\u201d. THAT is what makes OP TA.

Alicia may have been naive, but I think *John* is not doing the right thing here. Step relationships are difficult to navigate, but he's making his own children second-class family if he constantly leaves them to celebrate his first family without any other events to balance this out. I don't even think he needs to dial back on the time he spends with his late wife's family, but he should take at least the same amount of time and effort to spend quality time with Alicia and their kids, without the others.

Family isn't just blood related.  The new children are now part of the family.  I'm not saying that everyone gets treated exactly the same but to completely not include the younger kids in anything is rude and hurtful.  It also encourages the older kids to exclude the younger ones.

They could have had their own little party whenever the older kids went to the grandparents. Young kids aren't that hard to please, an afternoon playing football at the park and a bit of pizza would have made them happy and taken their minds off of their siblings being away. Plus, from OP's comments, it would seem that the older kids had an issue with the marriage from the beginning so it was unlikely that they'd ever want to have a relationship with any children from their step-mother/father's relationship.", "You\u2019re NTA.\n\nThe grandparents have 0 obligations to Alicia\u2019s children and never ever have to lay eyes on them if they so choose. \n\nHowever, if they are influencing the half-siblings into not wanting a relationship with the younger kids then that is an issue the dad needs to deal with.", "Do john's parents, not just his late wife's parents, also not see his wife and new children as family? are john's parents even in the picture? it's not exactly clear to me.", "Because the ex's family has a very tight unit.

When people invite us over, we say sorry, but we have a guest. Either they invite us to bring the guest (which is usual) or we would stay home. In this case I would not invite half of the kids to a celebration and leave the others out only to hear later about how amazing the party was. This is what is happening in this family on a regular basis. It is shameful.\n\nThe father is allowing his ex's parents to break up his own family celebrations so they  can take \"their\" kids away.

The younger siblings must be confused as to why their older siblings want nothing to do with them.", "NTA\n\nHer kids have your family and John's family. Why do they need a third family that they are in no way related to? Why doesn't she spend more time trying to make your side of the family more fun?", "Yeah \u2014 I see no issue with the former in-laws only considering their bio grandkids as grandkids. That seems normal to me.\n\nHowever, it seems *very* strange that his kids would want nothing to do with their half-siblings. It does seem incredibly rude and cold-hearted\u2026especially toward their own dad.\n\nAs for your response. I mean. A soft YTA. Being a stepmom is ridiculously difficult, and no one fully understands the extent of that difficulty before getting into it. \n\nWhen your sister is venting \u2014 would it kill you to hear her out and empathize instead of throwing it back in her face? \n\nOr, to put it another way, would you treat other \u201cconsequences of your own decisions\u201d as callously as you\u2019ve treated your sister\u2019s self-inflicted pain? \n\nWe all make choices that eff up our lives. If your best friend married a f***boy and got cheated on\u2026would you remind her that \u201cshe knew he had trouble being faithful when she married him\u201d or would you lend her a listening ear? \n\nIf your cousin\u2019s husband got cancer, would you remind her that \u201cshe knew cancer ran in his family when she married him\u201d or would you be empathetic? \n\nI don\u2019t see this as being any different. There are things we \u201cknow\u201d about before we experience them\u2026and then there are things we *know* about deeply, through hard-won experience.\n\nHopefully the next time you\u2019re dealing with a hurtful situation that is partly the result of your own choices, your sister is more understanding with you.", "NTA for a real reminder. Nothing new here. If your sister would\u2019ve focused on her family instead of what the in-laws were doing then she wouldn\u2019t be so \u2014-whatever she is right now.", "NTA", "If anything, Alicia's step-children sound like the assholes for treating their half-siblings as \"lesser.\" Which then by extension means whoever taught them to think that way (I'm guessing the grandparents) is also the asshole. I feel bad for your sister; she has some shitty people in her extended family, and I'm sorry her kids have to deal with it, too.  I grew up as a very unwelcome stepchild, so I know how bad that feels.\n\nAlso, why is your brother-in-law not handling his terrible ex-in-laws and his other kids? He could have stepped up to support his current wife and their kids by setting boundaries. He could have made it clear that his older kids were to treat their half-siblings as family members. He's the a-hole, too.\n\nYour sister is a bit the a-hole for not listening to reason, but you also could have been nicer to her and just let her have her feelings.\n\nI guess everybody sucks here? With, like, 50% of the suckage meted out to the grandparents and step-children, 30% to the husband who needs to step up, and you and your sister can just split that last 20% equally.", "NTA on your part, what I fail to understand is why does Alicia think she or her kids are entitled to anything from the in-laws? They aren\u2019t related and if they want to keep to their family, it\u2019s well within their rights.", "NTA...she was warned.  Not sure why she would expect the in laws to treat her kids as their grandchildren.", "She was warned. Didn't believe the warning and is now upset what she was warned about came to pass.", "This, this is it, NTA", "My own sisters family is in this situation, where a father was widowed and he remarried. And his wife\u2019s family treats all the children equally, no matter how they met. They even include my family and my children when they can \u2014 and we have zero ties to each other! \n\nIt\u2019s a really beautiful thing.", "Out of curiosity are the grandparents wealthy?", "And there is no indication of how much time passed between first wife dying and John remarrying. The ages do show that she gave birth twice within the first two years of marriage (or 3 at the outside). That might've just been too much for the stepkids.", ">Fine, if they're just inviting the kids, because those are the two that are part of their family. If John is going, it maybe gets a little weird, but still fine. Again, Alicia isn't married to their kid and her kids with John aren't even their \"step\" relations. Why would they be treated as part of that family?\n\nSaying to someone \"you're invited, but don't bring your wife or kids\" is a rather insulting invitation, IMO. I'd probably expect my spouse to refuse in that situation.", "I imagine the late wife's family still feels the pain of their loss acutely and it's hard to recognize and celebrate the woman who took her vacancy, no matter how great she may be.\nI can say I wouldn't act this way if I was in their position now but I know grief can be profound and irrational.", "I\u2019m glad you had the opportunity to reconnect with your niece. Was very similar with my nephews as new partner thought we treated them differently to her son & the daughter she had with my BIL. Families can be very difficult and the hurt caused was immense as I\u2019m sure was with you. People forget your also grieving the loss, with us even though BIL moved on we could never replace her nor could my nephews. And the new partner always seemed to be in competition with my sister which was ludicrous to us as we all welcomed her in the beginning. Hope your relationship with your niece continues as not fair for her not to have a relationship with her mothers family", ">Does she not understand how family trees work? John\u2019s first set of children have deceased wife\u2019s family and his family \u2014 two sets of families. The new children have his family, and her family \u2014 also two sets of families.\n\nMaybe it just has to do with the character limit, but... I would have liked OP to at least briefly mention what John's family's connection with these new kids is like.  The absence of mention of them might also just be because it's assumed that they are acting \"like grandparents\", because these younger kids are John's kids.\n\nBut Alicia's fixation on the late wife's family made me wonder if John's family are still around, or are located extremely far away, or what.  Does that exacerbate the situation?\n\nOf course, the late wife's family has no reason to include these new kids -- especially if their own grandchildren, their daughter's children, don't seem to really consider their half-siblings as real siblings, either.", "We have no idea what initiated then saying this. OP\u2019s sister could\u2019ve tried to contact them several times which caused them to explain these boundaries. Other commenters are wondering if they have a lot of money that OP\u2019s sister was motivated by\u2026it does seem weird that she is so intensely interested in the husband\u2019s former wife\u2019s parents\u2026rather than all the husband\u2019s bio relatives.", "Plus the timing seems to show that Alicia had 2 kids within the first 2 or 3 years of marriage. That can be A LOT to pre-teens who are still dealing with the loss of their mother.", "Haha---just posted about this a day or two ago. Hate that word! \"niblings\"....reminds me of corn.", "Agree. We've seen many posts on this site about stepparents coming into the family (especially when one parent has died) and PUSHED to have an immediate relationship. Those rarely work out well. I'm betting the kids wanted nothing to do with Alicia and she would not accept that and therefore pushed her kids on the older half-siblings.", "I didn't say you can force anything. \n\nBut the fact remains, they are siblings, and they should make an effort to get to know each other. From the OP's comments it sounds like the older ones don't want to get to know their younger brothers and sisters because they don't approve of their dads new wife. And that is an AH reason for shunning them. The kids didn't do anything wrong.", "You say that they \"should make an effort\", but you're not giving any reasons for it.\n\nThe kids didn't do anything wrong, true, and so actively bullying them or something would absolutely make the older siblings AHs. But just not having a relationship? What entitles the kids to a relationship with their half-siblings? Why does that outweigh the older kids' say in who they have a relation with?", "Just because you don\u2019t understand it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. There could be a million reasons why the older kids aren\u2019t connected with the younger ones, one of which I elaborated on in a comment to someone else. But at the end of the day we are missing some info in this regard, so my gut feeling is not to believe the worst in the older kids as they were still \u201ckids\u201d when their mom died and their father remarried someone else. They might have had to deal with a lot of grief and that is something I\u2019ve been through, so maybe I\u2019m more compassionate to their feelings \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It wouldn't be right for John to have ended the relationship between his oldest two children and their grandparents, but I don't understand why there's a need for the entire family (Alicia, John, and the 3 youngest children) to be involved with the grandparents.\n\nJohn and Alicia should have focused on creating cohesive family moments together with them and the 5 children without much focus on the grandparents. For holidays and whatnot they could have sent the two oldest children over to visit for an afternoon or whatever, John didn't have to bring everyone else along for a visit. If the grandparents doted on the two oldest with gifts and fun events, then John and Alicia could have made it up to the younger 3 with gifts or events for them to enjoy together. \n\nI don't understand why the grandparents would need to be involved in John, Alicia, or the 3 youngest children's lives at all.\n\nEdit: I also find it weird that the older children said they would not view their half siblings the same way they view full siblings and wouldn't share family traditions. That sounds like something they were coached to say or a perspective that was imparted on them somehow. I have two half siblings myself, with around the same age difference as in this scenario (they're 10 and 11 years younger than me) and I love them as much as I love my full sibling, zero difference, wouldn't even dream of treating them worse in any way.", "Nope, not at all, NTA. Why did she think that the extended family that lost one child, would want anything to do with the person that\u2019s replacing their deceased daughter? \nI\u2019m sure the stepchildren feel the same, hence they rejected the possibility of a relationship. Clearly, Alicia\u2019s husband did not do his job if his children chose to leave as soon as they could.", "NTA but she is all there? Because why on earth would a couple who lost their daughter be happy to include another woman who has taken over their daughters life? She has their daughters husband, kids and home and future. Its devastating. Their sole focus is to channel everything to their grandkids that their daughter cant do. They shouldn't waste an ounce of that any one else's children.\n\nAlso her children have you and your family, and they have the dad's family. Why do her kids deserve three sets of families?  Her kids get to have a living mother and father - but oh that's not good enough she wants more - whilst her step kids are motherless so any ounce of love afforded to them by their maternal grandparents she wants to steal and channel to her kids.  Its just disgraceful and I cant blame the step kids not wanting anything to do with their half siblings and her after her demands from their maternal family.", "Yep.\n\nAnd the fact that they started doing so at such a young age\u2026makes me think this whole \u201cthey\u2019re not your *real* family\u201d idea was planted in their brains as a whisper campaign from their maternal grandparents.\n\nI agree it\u2019s gross and weird. And short-sighted on the grandparents\u2019 part. They were minors when Alicia became stepmom\u2026they live with dad and stepmom full time.\n\nWhy would grandparents want to give Alicia any reason to resent those kids? Why would they want to drive a wedge between the kids, their half siblings, and their dad?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to me and feels cruel.", "Who said they treated the kids poorly? How can you treat someone poorly if you never interact with them? The grandparents don\u2019t owe those kids anything. They have zero relation to the step kids. It\u2019s not their fault that the stepmom decided that people would automatically take in her kids even when the grandparents clearly stated that they wanted nothing to do with her and johns future kids. Just because you have a good relationship with your siblings doesn\u2019t mean that johns oldest kids have to have one with theirs. OP said that the older kids don\u2019t even interact with their dad and that he is closed off and that they didn\u2019t really like that he was remarrying in the first place. It could be the that John moved on like 6 months after their mom died coupled with the fact that they didn\u2019t seem to be close with their dad in the first place. It could also be that their new stepmom is trying to force herself and her kids into their lives and not respecting the older kid\u2019s boundaries. We don\u2019t know anything. We don\u2019t know what the grandparents have been telling the kids.

Odds are, i wouldn\u2019t be receptive to step siblings either.", "The step kids were 11 and 8, when their father remarried. So they were 12 and 9 when the first half-sibling was born.\n\nThat is definitely a big age gap!  Even as the younger kids become more interactive, the older kids are in their mid or later teens and their focus is completely different.\n\nIt just depends a lot on the kids, and on the family, how interactive older kids are with younger kids.  My brother is 10 years older than me.  So by the time I was 5, obviously he was 15.  But he spend a reasonable amount of time with me when I was growing up.  He'd play games with me, or even just let me sit on his bed while he was doing homework, and I was just daydreaming and listening to the music he was playing while he worked.  We didn't do \\*everything\\* together, of course.  His interests were those of a teen and then late teen, and when I was 11, he got married and was out and forming his own family.\n\nAn age gap like that \\*alone\\* doesn't mean the kids don't spend any time together, or have no real connection.\n\nWhat I think that points to, of course, is that both OP's sister, and her husband, probably handled this whole thing really poorly.  Just from the description here, it absolutely sounds like Alicia was pushy, and that is going to backfire, 9 times out of 10.

Holidays with John's kids should have alternated between the in-laws and Alicia & John's family. Vacations should have been alternating. Birthdays for the older kids should have been held jointly. The in-law grandparents should not have been given priority over every special event which would normally involve family during the last 10 years.\n\nIf this is the case, Alicia & John screwed up big time, because now John's kids are legal adults and don't have to spend any time with their family.", "NTA but neither is your sister.  \n\nOn the other hand, your sister's step-children are massive AH.\n\nI am sick to death of reading all of these posts where older kids REFUSE to be decent to younger half-siblings, or step-siblings.
