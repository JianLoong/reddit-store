John was a widower with a son who is now 21 and a daughter who is now 19. John's late wife's family was still a strong presence in the lives of their grandchildren when Alicia met John and it was discussed, and made clear, that John's son and daughter with his wife were their grandchildren and any future children from John and Alicia would not be regarded as such and would not be entitled to anything from them, the former in-law's. John's children also shared their perspective that they would not consider any half siblings the same as they considered their full sibling and they wouldn't try to share traditions from their maternal family with any half siblings.\n\nI remember my parents and brother (42m) raising concerns with Alicia about her decision to marry into the family with that information. She has always held the view that things change and also that families can never have too many people, especially if she's involved. Nobody can be liked by everyone but Alicia has always held the belief that people should want her around. We all told her at the time that we hoped she was aware of what she was signing up for and she dismissed us.\n\nNow Alicia has three children with John and those kids are now 10, 9 and 7. True to their word, John's in-law's from his first marriage do not consider my nieces and nephew as grandkids and they are not included in their family functions. And John's older children have next to no relationship with their half siblings. I'm not entirely sure on all the details on this but my sister is not happy.\n\nAlicia's complaints are that her kids are excluded and have never been welcome by John's in-law's. That her stepkids have never changed their stance since that conversation and do not treat my nieces and nephew as siblings. That things she considers small, like being included in some kind of book, are denied to her children. It has hurt the children to see their older siblings enjoy this very close family dynamic and not be a part of it. Alicia is enraged by this. She ranted and raved about it and there are things I could not keep up with. But everything she was warned about by our parents, brother and me are now very big issues for her.\n\nThis is where I might be TA. I brought up to Alicia that she knew what she was getting into when she married John and that she had been warned by all of our family to reflect and see if it was what she wanted. I told her she doesn't get to be mad now when everyone laid their intentions out early. I said she can be disappointed things didn't change. But ultimately she made choices and every choice has a consequence, be it a good or bad one. She accused me of holding her accountable for the shitty behavior of others and said nobody would assume people could be so cold hearted or that kids could hold such strong views from such a young age. She said I was being cruelly unfair to her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692604495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x0vy3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_knew_what_she_was/", "score": 139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her parents are probably the only thing that gives them a sense of her presence and they didn\u2019t want to let their time be ruined with the reality that she\u2019s not coming back and dad has a new wife and kids.

She cannot be mad that things are exactly how they where laid out to her in advance", "NTA. The way things are, Alicia should be talking to her kids and normalizing this unique family dynamic that they have.

I think when someone passes and leaves children it is very much up to the individual how relationships continue especially when new spouses and new children enter the mix. Your sister is wrong for expecting these people to open their lives to her children as they have no reason to do so. She should maybe be more empathetic to their views & as stated by previous posters make her own traditions for her family. As for the children not accepting their new half siblings I think that is down to her Husband to converse with them as they are now adults it would be a shame to not have some kind of relationship with siblings", "NTA.

It's the harsh truth but it sounds like there is more to the story surrounding John.\n\nHe doesn't seem to have a good relationship with the kids and perhaps didn't even when their mother was still alive.\n\nThe kids grandparents have no obligation to your sisters kids.  They are not related to them in any, way, shape or form... which means they owe them nothing, especially not a relationship.  \n\nIt doesn't sound like John had that much of a relationship with the inlaws because he hasn't had much to do with them.\n\nJohn's kids have some genetic connection to your sisters kids but they aren't interested in a relationship.  That's their choice and they are free to make it no matter how much it sucks.\n\nNone of this is your fault.", "NTA\n\nI just love the way it reads:\"John in-law's\", nowadays, should be your family and parents. The former in-laws should not be in any way part of the picture for your sister. The thing is that it reads like they're stranded from your family but the former in-laws are a constant fixture in their lives... If that's the case, it's ESH. If it's not like that, your sister should stop feeling like the center of the universe.\n\nThe first kids thing is weird tho. Given the 20 years gap with their half-siblings it makes sense they aren't really close with them. But they seem too cold.", "I actually blame John here and she is right to some respect the in-laws promoted the behaviour that their half siblings aren\u2019t not considered family and that should have been nipped in the bud years ago by John.", "NTA. You're right, she can be disappointed that things didn't change.\n\nThe older kids have clearly been influenced by their maternal grandparents. It's completely fine if the in-laws don't view the new kids as their grandkids because they're not. It's their choice whether they want to involve others in the family functions. But it doesn't seem like they've even let the kids to get to know each other and make up their own minds about having a relationship. That's what's bizarre about this whole situation.", "INFO: Wait, okay, so the late wife's family doesn't want the new family around, and the kids are too old to consider new kids true siblings. I mean, I get it, but what did they expect, that John remains sad and alone for all eternity? Complicated stance, but fine, whatever.\n\nHow much does that affect the kids though? You say the new wife and their kids aren't invited to family functions. But how often do they go to those? There are two other families involved, how much holiday time do they get? Does Alicia's family include the kids from the previous marriage? Do they make their own traditions and books and such?", "YTA. Do YOU even love your sister? Because telling someone you love, who is reaching out to vent and maybe get a little bit of sympathy from you the equivalent of \u201cI told you so\u201d and \u201cyou made your bed, now lie in it\u201d, makes you an asshole. You may be right, I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong, but you\u2019re an asshole. Especially when it\u2019s something as serious as marriage and child raising. Especially especially when your sister is feeling alienated by people she obviously cares very much for, to begin with. You could have chosen to offer comfort, or even productive advice.

Totally different stage in their life.\n\nI had a half brother like this.  He was 12 years younger than me.  It's not that I didn't love him but I was out with my friends riding our bikes for many kms to get somewhere and he was in kindergarten needing supervision.  He was a great kid but the age gap was large and it seems larger when you are a kid.", "I think the difference is what you consider your \"family\".\n\nTo me, barring exceptions where someone is mentally or physically dangerous to be around, \"family\" is your blood family plus people you choose to make family, e.g. step children, foster children, really good friends and so on.\n\nBut you don't get to force others to consider your chosen family, their chosen family. You can't force step siblings to emotionally consider each other family because the two adults decided to get married, you can only expect politeness within the household. Other peoples emotions aren't yours to dictate.\n\nIt is absolutely the default that in-laws through a now deceased spouse *aren't* family to children born with a new partner. They have zero blood relation to those children, and had no power in the decision of their deceased child's partner remarrying and having more children, so it's not chosen family for them either. \n\nAny in-laws through a deceased spouse who do embrace new children with a new partner as their grandchildren aren't the default, they are incredible. They would have to make children who would they would not know if their own child was still alive, their chosen family, and that is huge.\n\nIt's also not unfair to the new children that their half/step siblings grandparents are not their grandparents, because *they have two loving parents  while their half/step siblings do not*.", "Might be this huge age gap.", "That may be sad for the younger siblings, but it's the decision of the older ones. 21 year-old university-aged people have very little in common with 7 year-old children. If the relationship was 100% decided on by the older siblings, then that's their choice which they're free to make, and it should be respected regardless how uncomfortable it may make the others feel. Maybe in time all siblings will grow closer once the little ones also grow up, maybe not. It's a choice, at the end of the day, that some people make for themselves.", "The grandparents have set the standard of behavior that's easy to follow. The kids were 8 and 10.

It also sounded a bit like they objected to the new marriage in general to me, which is why I asked and didn't judge. I'd especially like to know how much time they claim for their exclusive family.

Alicia was naive, which doesn't make her an AH. OP was honest and direct about something she probably should've foreseen. In this case, that doesn't make them an AH. The in-laws are probably not AHs either, but I'd need more info. Edit: I replied to OP in another comment, I think John might be the issue.", "Is John invited to those functions ? \n\nHave his first two kids always lived with him ?

But on the other hand, it seems like they hog a lot of special time with only part of the family. That really isn't fair to the younger kids, by which I DO NOT mean they should stop. Alicia may have been naive, but I think *John* is not doing the right thing here. Step relationships are difficult to navigate, but he's making his own children second-class family if he constantly leaves them to celebrate his first family without any other events to balance this out. I don't even think he needs to dial back on the time he spends with his late wife's family, but he should take at least the same amount of time and effort to spend quality time with Alicia and their kids, without the others. That's not on Alicia. And I think you're pretty harsh with her.

They are not related to these kids by blood or marriage, they would not even know Alicia or her children with their former son-in-law if their own child hadn't *died*.\n\nAnd it isn't unfair on the new kids they they don't get to go to the family functions of their half siblings on the side they aren't related two, because the new kids have two living parents, while their half sibling's mother is *dead*.\n\nIf they would trade their mothers life for access to these family functions to make it actually \"fair\", then they have a whole different set of problems to deal with.", "I believe he was to one or two of them though I am not entirely sure.

I also can't say for sure it hasn't come from the maternal family but I have sensed for years that the kids had an issue with John and I believe that is more likely the reason.", "I don't know that John has attended any of these events. I know that his kids do. I believe he was invited to one or two things. But as far as I can tell it was always just his older two kids going.", "What do you think of John ?", "He's a bit of a hard one for me to figure out. He's not very emotive. I also think he hasn't been very involved in much of this family trouble despite being the father of all the kids involved and married to my sister. Alicia has never mentioned anything he has said or done in any of this. So I feel like he listens to her rant and at least on some level he's aware that his first two kids no not appear to be at all close to him. He keeps to himself and I get the impression it's the same way all the time.", "Could it be that your sister took the same attitude as she did now with her stepkids and completely ignored their boundaries ?! Cause this would explain the attitude they have twords both her and the half siblings -if she knowingly ignored their wants/whishes/needs and just went on disregarding anything they said"]}
