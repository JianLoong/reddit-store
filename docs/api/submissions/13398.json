It's definitely weird to abruptly change a family tradition because your recent gf doesn't think it's normal. Imagine what your sister is feeling now. At best she thinks (you think) one of you is now too old to show affection to their sibling, or that you placed your new girlfriends' feelings over hers (which you kinda did), and at worst she now thinks YOU felt you were doing something wrong or (going from the tone you used here) pervy about you kissing her on the cheek, i.e. that you were feeling something unbrotherly when doing that.", "You're willing to break a family tradition over somebody you've been banging for 3 months? That's kind of pathetic", "Im in my 40s and I still kiss my older bro on the cheek.  ur GF is the creepy one.  What is her problem with it?  Does her family not show any affection?  Is she sexualizing ur relationship w lil sis?  Would she have same problem if it was ur lil bro,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA> GF IS!!!", "It's totally normal to kiss your sibling on a cheek as a greeting and goodbye or goodnight. My brother always does it and gives me a hug, and we are in our 40s btw. \nIt's none of your GF's business how you interact with your sister.", "YTA for listening to someone you are only seeing for three months.  A kiss on the lips I could see as creepy, but on the cheek?  And it is your sister?  Keep the tradition and dump the girlfriend.", "YTA.  You are letting someone dictate a relationship with your sister.  I personally thought your actions were cute.  You do know that your sister's definition of male relationships will be based on the relationship she has with the males in her family.\n\nIf the gf considers, kissing a relative on the cheek as creepy, I would love to hear her familial experiences.  Hope you know you're damaging the relationship with your sister over a controlling ass gf of three-whole-months. Next, it'll be, she doesn't like you visiting or hanging out with your sister.  You're grown and she's not your parent.", "NTA - your GF is hella creepy for thinking it's \"weird\" or unusual to kiss a sibling harmlessly on the cheek.\n\nEwwww and she is gross for making it sexual. It's a cheek-kiss. On a relative. That is 10000% normal. So are hugs, is she weird about those too??\n\nKeep the smooches for lil' sis and ditch the GF for one that's sane.", "\\[Soon to be ex\\~\\] gf is the weird one. Seriously, jealous of your little sister?!!", "Where I live the norm is 2-3x when greeting someone (even acquaintances or total strangers) and again 2-3x when saying goodbye. It's a cultural difference, so it's plenty fine if she finds it odd, but it's not OK for her to sexualise it (particularly because this is your sister you're kissing on the cheek AND she's a child, it's creepy twice over for gf to sexualise it) and force you to stop.\n\nESH because she sucks but you'd also suck if you allow her to dictate what you do in this context.", "Honestly it\u2019s hard to even say YTA because it\u2019s glaringly obvious that your girlfriend is actually the true asshole. \n\nYou\u2019re not an *asshole*, just an idiot for putting your girlfriend, NOT your wife, before your family.", "In my family everyone (all over age 23) kisses on the cheek for goodbyes. My parents, sisters, all of us kiss on the cheek, and I would be wildly offended if anyone in my family refused a cheek peck from me. I've actually been very hurt by this and my family knows it's a must for goodbyes or I'll die. So No it's not creepy, but maybe you're girlfriend is a creep.", "YTA. Your girlfriend of 3 months is an ignorant child. Your girlfriend is sexualizing your relationship with your sister and that is what\u2019s creepy. People all around the world greet family - all family - with kisses. It\u2019s nothing new.", "I think it is an awesome tradition to kiss a younger sibling Hello and goodbye. Your girlfriend is wrong. It\u2019s not creepy. Keep it up.\n\nIf you apologize to your sister, NTA.", "It\u2019s creepier that your gf is sexualizing kissing your SISTER on the cheek. Just sayin", "YTA. And your girlfriend is weirdly sexualizing your relationship with your sister and controlling your behavior, which is toxic and disturbing.\n\nAll I can say is that I WISH my older brother were still alive to kiss me on the cheek.

TREASURE IT, and anyone who tries to get in the middle of it can f\\*ck right off.", "YTA.\n\nKeep the sister, the cheek kisses, and your wonderful relationship.\n\nDrop the girlfriend who already wants to control you after three months, and wants to sexualize your relationship with your sister.", "European here.. its super common to kiss people on the cheek why is it weird ?!

As well as my grandma dad and pretty much anyone else in my family. Why would you let some girl you barely know change the way you\u2019ve been with your family for years. YTA for being so insecure. Apologize to your sister and tell your girlfriend to get help. She clearly wasn\u2019t shown enough affection growing up.", "ESH- a kiss on the cheek is in no way inappropriate between brother and sister.  Many people who aren\u2019t related at all kiss each other in greeting or farewell.  You suck for stopping this sweet behavior because your gf is making an issue out of it.  Your gf sucks for making an issue out of it.", "NTA your partner made you feel bad about something innocent and you felt like you were doing something wrong. For the record in some cultures (like mine I\u2019m French) kissing on the cheek is how people greets each other. It will only be wrong if the person being kiss on the cheek wouldn\u2019t like it.", "YTA. It's cultural thing where my dad is from everybody kisses everybody on cheeks as a hello and good bye, women, men, old, young. No one ever think it's creepy unless you make it creepy. It's not like you grab her ass while doing it.", "Soft YTA. It is heart-rendingly sad that siblings who get along and love each other are demonized for having a small innocent display of that affection. Apologize to your sister today. Your GF on the other hand, is TAH. She needs to accept this or FO. (That needs to happen today too)", "You need to grow a set and tell your girlfriend it's not creepy.

That's not a norm in the USA and may be viewed as \"weird\" between friends.", "Just tell your gf you were raised by Italians, and calling it creepy is an insult to your cultural heritage.", "Do NOT let gf manipulate you into withholding affection from your sister or anyone else.

She\u2019s a 14 year old child being told that receiving a kiss on the cheek from her brother is creepy (subtext- because it would be sexual!). So sad. This kind of stuff made me feel so terrible and hyper self conscious when I was young.", "Seriously. It's become a tad less common since Covid, but where I live in Central Europe it is still very common to give every female friend a kiss on each cheek when you arrive and depart. The funny thing is that in the neighboring country they do the same thing, but start on the opposite cheek, so it can get confusing greeting friends from there. :D", "Or certain places in the U.S. South.

You should ask why, what is wrong with that precisely according to her.", "What about it is weird or creepy, according to her?", "It's not, what's weird is how she's making it weird. I hug and kiss my family members. Born and raised in the US. No one I know considers this to be weird. It's just family. It's your little sister.

A kiss on the cheek is a perfectly acceptable way to greet someone the world over. It\u2019s not a weird gesture just in your family. Your girlfriend is being obtuse and kind of a judgmental prude, IMO.", "What is she right about? \nAlso how long have you been dating this woman? \n\nKissing someone on the cheek is common welcome practice in a lot of countries especially with family \nYour sister is 14 and is going to notice the change in the behaviour is coming from you is because of your GF stick to your tradition and don\u2019t let some girlfriend tell you how to treat your sister", "Hi, \"OP's\"  gf", "What is she right about?", "She's not right. Kissing family members on the cheek is not strange. People all over the world do it. Folks who have kids kiss their babies on the cheeks. Affection isn't automatically sexual.
