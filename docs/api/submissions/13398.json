She is absolutely dead wrong. YTA if you change how you show affection to your sister over your girlfriend\u2019s opinion (that is based in some very creepy sexualization she is doing)", "Did your GF get a hold of your phone or what?? You thought it was perfectly fine until she said something, she's jealous of your little sister and thats weird behavior ..my heart breaks for your poor little sis", "She isn\u2019t right at all", "Your GF is wrong!!! Kissing on the cheek is common in many countries & cultures around the world especially among family.  \nThe only thing weird is your GF response & comments to you. That is something she might want to look into.", "No she isn't. Stop. The only creep here is her.", "YTA for letting her do that. I, 30, give my sister 26 a kiss on her cheek as I\u2019m leaving. I kiss most of my family actually man or woman. You\u2019re not full lip kissing her. It\u2019s not weird, it\u2019s a sign of affection and your girlfriend is gross for making it anything other than that.", "Lol. That\u2019s a good one.", "Your quote supports what I said. He\u2019s saying it\u2019s weird that she wants him to kiss her because she has a lot of friends. He\u2019s implying two things: that having a lot of friends means you can\u2019t be lonely (bullshit) and that her wanting him to kiss her comes from some defect of her character (creepy).", "French girl here - we give TWO cheek kisses!", "I also wondered what is going on with GF, does she have some trauma involving that unwanted physical contact? Has she expressed other things making her uncomfortable or that something bad happened to her? Either way, you\u2019re NTA for kissing your sister on the cheek but you W B T A if you stopped because of the girlfriend\u2019s opinion.", "I am from Brazil. Same thing there. We kiss and hug a lot. It\u2019s pretty normal to us. In some states you give only a kiss in one of the cheeks, while in others you give a kiss on each cheek.", "American, half-Spanish half-Italian. No family  gathering is complete without its full 30 minutes of kissing and hugging at the start and end.", "Italian and Greek here, if you make it out of a family gathering with less than 20 cheek kisses that means they hate you.", "Oh I love my italian relatives. They are so much fun and very loving and inclusive.", "I\u2019m Cuban and we do the same cheek to cheek kiss thing but it\u2019s only ever on one cheek, for us two cheeks would be super extra lol so just depends on the culture", "LOL it\u2019s impossible to leave places! I admire the Irish goodbye after being raised doing this. I would never dare do an Irish goodbye but I can dream.", "A few people not related but I consider family are from Australia. They do 3 alternating cheek kisses. Didn't grow up with any cheek kiss greetings so this leads to me laughing when I forget the 2 that follow. Not creepy. Wicked endearing actually.\nETA: NTA in the least. But I'd maybe think about clearing the air with your sister so she doesn't think it's something she did.", "Swiss. We give three. I don\u2019t know why", "My brother dated a woman who grew up in a family that never hugged or showed physical affection. She found the whole hugging thing baffling. We didn't hug her at first because it made her uncomfortable but then she decided she'd go along with it.\n\nSo she'd stand by the door and announce, \"Okay, I'm ready for the hugs\" and we'd all hug her. I think she got to a point where she liked the ritual of it.", "This one always makes me laugh! I remember doing the vestibular and meeting a few people from different regions. When we'd greet each other it was adorable mayhem; \"3 kisses here, I'm from SC! \\[one more smack\\]\"/ \"Oop sorry I'm from PR, we just do one kiss, but no worries I can do two\". \n\nTem dias que realmente adoro ser BR AHUSAHSUA", "French here, same!", "Same in the Netherlands!", "This announcement is very sweet, like, \"ok I'm over with finding it weird, everyone get in here\" and then everyone pile on her in a big family hug", "I am from a very affectionate family, always big hugs and Ma will always smother our cheeks with kisses. Even my friends growing up were super affectionate (though in different ways. Hugs and punches lol) When I got to college, it was a hard turn to realize that other people were not as affectionate. I learned super fast that not everyone is comfy with hugging their friends, and that's okay! I now always ask before physically touching my friends in any capacity. There are exceptions, like my roommate was gonna step right in dog doo the other day (in his white sneakers) and I yoinked him out of the way. Or if someone is going to fall/ get hurt, obviously that is different. \n\n\n\nEveryone has different boundaries and touches they are comfortable with, and that's okay! It's always good to ask and to let other people know when you are uncomfy. What is not okay is sexualizing a non-sexual act between two family members just because it is something they would not personally do. Girlfriend could have expressed discomfort without making it weird and perverted. \"Hey babe, I just really think of this as more of a romantic gesture that I'd prefer was just for me. I'm not saying you and your sister are romantic, just that this is not something I'm comfortable with. Could you make an alternate tradition, that you can keep special, that doesn't make me as uncomfortable?\" And compromise from there. Or not. But calling it creepy right away was uncalled for. NTA", "I just thought about this. Yes, every family and culture is different in what people do/don't do. Just like in some countries wearing knee-length clothes is considered modest and in others it's obnoxious. Also, holding hands in public is normal to some people and frowned upon by others. You're right. OP should explain to his girlfriend what his family considers normal. It totally depends on how it was modelled to her.", "That is so sweet! The way your family held back until she was comfortable, and once she was comfortable everyone gave her hugs\u2026..\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd79\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Kissing on the mouth is another one. My family never kissed on the lips. I can recall being shocked and a little weirded out when I first found out that some families smooch each other on the mouth, since in my head that was something you only did with a romantic partner. But I adjusted pretty quickly. Different strokes for different folks and all that.", "My immediate family and maternal grandmother never kissed the kids/grandkids in the lips, but my maternal great grandpas both did, so this may partially be a generational thing."]}
