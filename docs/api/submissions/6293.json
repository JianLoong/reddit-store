He's a very healthy weight for his height, tall thin (but muscley from work as a diesel mechanic), but high blood pressure is no joke so he decided to try to clean up his diet a little. \n\nI do 90% of the cooking at home (by choice, he does dishes and vacuums so this isn't an issue), and I genuinely cook on the healthier side. I'm only 5'3\" and slim and athletic so I focus a lot on healthy proteins, so we eat a lot of proteins and veggies and I like to play around with different sauces and things to make it interesting. I feel like the meals I make set a strong foundation for an overall healthy lifestyle. My boyfriend loves my cooking and always brags to his friends about the things we eat. \n\nSuddenly, my boyfriend decided he doesn't want to eat salt in the things we eat at home...at all. I can't work with that. We've never used salt excessively in our diet so asking me to cut a healthy amount of salt from our meals just seems ridiculous. I do too much cardio and strength training and don't want to end up with a sodium deficiency because my boyfriend suddenly decided we can't have salt in breakfast or dinner (meals we eat together). I brought that up to me and he suggested salting my food separately (which...fine but we all know it doesn't taste the same) or cooking our food in separate pots, or for me to supplement in other ways (like Gatorade). \n\nThis is where the issue comes in...I would be perfectly happy to make these accommodations if I felt like it would actually help, but he's constantly snacking on high sodium snacks (like chips and pretzels and frozen egg rolls) and I just feel like it's unfair to ask me to change how I salt our food before working to cut out some of his unhealthy eating choices. \n\nHe's gotten to the point where he feels like he's disrespected if I cook for both of us and use salt, and he'll refuse to eat or do the dishes if I tell him I've salted the food. I think he's being a baby and refuse to stop salting our food. \n\nWe're at an impasse. So, AITA? \n\nTl;dr: My boyfriend has slightly high blood pressure and asked me to stop salting our food but I refuse. AITA?\n\nEdit for info: to clarify, my question is mostly \"Am I the asshole for refusing to make 100% of the changes to address his issue when he refuses to make literally any changes outside of the two meals I cook us?\" I feel like the salt content in our food is not going to be the change he needs to reduce his sodium content. Also, when I say he snacks, I'm talking frequent snacks- around 6-8 times a day.", "created_utc": 1672671711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101enqe/aita_for_not_cutting_the_salt_from_the_dinners_i/", "score": 3261, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A meeting with a nutritionist (RD) that you BOTH go to since you are the one cooking would also help to point out where the sodium is actually coming from.

If he's eating freakin chips and pretzels on the side, I'm gonna go NTA re: main meals. Snacks is the easiest place to cut salt if you need to. It's why I cut soda from my diet when I learned how much of my family has/had diabetes and/or pancreatic cancer.", "NTA, but hopefully you're insisting that you'll only cook salt free with a few other major changes. Start stocking only low-sodium foods, ditch the egg rolls. If he insists, figure out how much sodium he eats in his snacks compared to what you put in the meal and ask him to choose wisely.", "NTA he can cook his own food like many others with self imposed dietary restrictions.", "NTA - if he has hands (or feet based on some youtube videos) he can cook for himself.", "NTA. It would be different if his doctor put him on a strict no-salt diet.

Tell him you'll visit the doctor with him and see what the doctor says about the overall salt situation?", "NTA because he is still eating other salt. \n\nMy Dad had high blood pressure and he totally had to cut all salt, and so even cooking with a normal/light amount was not good for him. In this case, my mom would have been an AH if she refused to cut out salt, but of course she loves him so she cut out cooking with salt and just salted her own food after, or did separate batches if the salt need to be part of the cooking process. \n\nBut, my Dad also ate celery and fruit and unsalted nuts. He committed to no salt (well low salt) and didn't put it on my mom to fix him. \n\nI think you tell your boyfriend when he cuts out salt from the food he controls- chips, etc- then you can discuss cutting salt from what you cook. This is such a typical response- he has a problem and wants to make it your problem to solve, while not taking any actions to solve it himself.", "NTA. He\u2019s not serious about cutting it out. That being said, there are salt substitutes out there if you ever need them.", "OMG... I would be so passive aggressive with the salty snacks... Like count the stuff, like sodium rates while eating the junk food... I would be so obnoxious providing numbers if not lectures about healthy food that he would not be able to enjoy the snack in my presence.\nNTA but really my reaction would not get you out of the impasse. Hope redditors can find some ideas to deal with such a AH behaviour without making the whole relationship blow up.", "holy crap NTA. A tiny increase in BP with an already low sodium intake probably means that salt isn't the problem. You could cut it in half if you added in some No Salt, but you shouldn't have to, especially if he's still eating a ton of high-sodium processed foods.", "NTA - I think some of the people who think Y T A and leaving the salt out of your cooking is no big deal don't cook much. Leaving salt out entirely is a huge deal. I am on a low sodium diet for a kidney condition. I still use salt in my cooking, but I use less. It is far more important to avoid processed foods.\n\nI would sit down with your bf when you're both calm and discuss this reasonably. Ask him (politely) to look at the sodium content of his snacks and compare that with the salt in your cooking. Be prepared to make reasonable concessions like lowering the amount of salt in your meals. \n\nIf the bf is still insistent on having all his meals prepared salt-free, I would let him prepare them himself. I have a feeling he would just eat processed food - much more sodium than your cooking - and shoot himself in the foot.", "I was so ready to say you were the AH until you added that he still eats all that junk food. You shouldn't be expected to do more to help his health than he is willing to. NTA\n\nAlso, he can pop popcorn without salt, there are no salt potato chips, etc.", "NTA because he\u2019s making zero effort. Did the doctor tell him to reduce salt? Not everyone is even effected by it. He may benefit much more from exercise and stress reduction.", "NTA - your boyfriend is not owning responsibility for his health issue. Tell him when he starts eating low or no sodium snacks then you will support him by reducing salt in your cooking. If he continues to disrespect your cooking, just start cooking for one.", "NTA. The amount of salt you add to the food you make is minimal compared to the salt he eats in his snacks and in any food you eat from restaurants. If he is truly interested in cutting salt, he needs to start with his snacks and any restaurant food. Once he's done that, and if he blood pressure is still too high, you can considered cutting back on the salt you add to your food.", "I was all ready to call you the asshole until you said he is not taking responsibility for himself and cutting out sodium in his snacks. If he was doing that and you still insisted on pre-salting everything he ate, then yes you would be but at this point, no.", "NTA, He needs to cut out the high sodium snacks rather than focusing in on a very healthy small amount used to season food when cooking.", "NTA\n\nIt's time for you guys to each just cook your own meals, do your own dishes and split the rest of the household chores.\n\nThen he can have his food the way he wants it and go to town with his snacks and you are not stuck earing tasteless food", "NTA, he can make his own food", ">but he's constantly snacking on high sodium snacks (like chips and pretzels and frozen egg rolls\n\n>Also, when I say he snacks, I'm talking frequent snacks- around 6-8 times a day.\n\nNTA\n\nIf your bf wants you to cut the salt out from your cooking, it's only fair he takes the first step and cut out those snacks. \n\nI would point out the nutritional information on those snacks and show him how much salt is in them vs how much salt you use in your cooking.", "NTA, but I am biased when it comes to salt in cooking. I use it often, but just enough to help the flavour stand out. \nIf he is still eating chips and stuff like that, dredged with salt, then he is absolutely an asshole pulling a double standard.", "NTA - the salty snacks he is eating are way more a problem then the salt you use in your cooking.\n\nHave you tried MSG yet?", "NTA. If he won't change his own diet first, he gets no say in your cooking.      \n\nDid his doctor actually say he has high blood pressure? One high reading means absolutely nothing, so unless his doctor actually suggested cutting his salt, he's making a big deal out of nothing anyway.", "The snacks are the issue.  I wanted my husband to change our food (he is the cook) because I have just found out I have high cholesterol and am prediabetic. Looking at my diet though I need to stop the alcohol and snacks. Its not on him.\n\nEdited to say NTA.", "Honestly I would give him what he wants but I would go one step further and cut out all seasonings. You say he loves your cooking and knowing how to season is one of the biggest things that makes someone an amazing cook. I know that most people hate eating peoples cooking who don\u2019t know how to properly season food. My guess he\u2019ll be like why is this not tasting like normal? And quickly start begging for salt back in a heartbeat! But I wouldn\u2019t do it, that\u2019s when I would actually stop cooking for him and make him cook for himself. NTA", "If you are cooking meals from scratch at home, the amount of salt you are using is not likely to affect a person's blood pressure. However, everything your boyfriend is eating that comes from a bag, a box, or a can has more sodium than he needs.\n\nGather up the packaging from his prepared foods and show him how many days worth of salt is in one day's consumption of the foods he eats outside of what you are preparing. Then tell him he's responsible for his situation and only his decision to change unhealthy habits will affect it.", "The perfect solution is that you cook for yourself. If bf isn\u2019t even going to be reasonable with his request, and continue to undermine his diet on his own with snacking, than I \u2018d put no further effort into feeding him.", "I would say NTA because he can be more responsible with his snacking and/or cook his own meals. However, anecdotally, my husband is also physically fit, but has genetically high cholesterol. He's been on statins since his 20s, but had a test come back high a couple years ago. I want this man around as long as I can have him, so I made a few adjustments to the way I cook to try to help. You're not necessarily TA for not wanting to change your cooking style, but I do think it's a gesture of love to adapt for his health.", "NTA. I've had dietary restrictions throughout my life, but i would never force them on my loved ones. If the meal that was made for everyone was restricted for me, I'd just make/buy something that wasn't.", "NTA. No. You\u2019re the one doing the legwork of cooking and asking to cut out all sodium is fucking ridiculous. No doctor is going to recommend cutting out all sodium except mayyybe in super extreme circumstances. Especially if you\u2019re exercising, YES sodium intake is incredibly important. Electrolytes are pretty much synonymous with sodium and some people just do not understand that. He should be eating low sodium snacks and low sodium meals, and he should definitely be allotting more daily sodium intake to actual meals over snacks unless it\u2019s right before exercise. He\u2019s throwing a temper tantrum because he wants YOU to manage his health rather than managing it himself. And he\u2019s not even doing the actual research on how to eat a well rounded diet and effectively lower BP (salt is just one small component) so imho he\u2019s being pretty damn lazy.", "NTA - him asking you to stop normal seasoning levels while snacking on frozen egg rolls is the least self aware thing I've heard in a while", "I would have said Y T A  until I heard about his snacks. Whilst I was awaiting a kidney transplant I had to have a low salt diet. Like you I love cooking so I did experiment a lot with herbs and spices, which helped a lot with flavour when cooking without salt, so if he does cut his snacks out and you want to try low salt cooking, you could try that.

He can cook his own meals if he\u2019s that concerned which, let\u2019s face it, he clearly isn\u2019t it he\u2019s eating pretzels and frozen egg rolls between meals. He\u2019s just pushing the responsibility for his nutrition to you, while doing nothing himself", "NTA. Although I think it's totally reasonable to cut down the salt in the meals you make, cutting out the salt completely is a bit much, if he won't contribute to the cooking. The salt that is added to food is generally not what causes people to have excess sodium in their diet. It's processed foods (like the snack foods he's eating).\n\nI think you could easily compromise by adding maybe half the usual amount of salt to the foods you make, then adding some at the end on your own. But your boyfriend needs to start contributing to the cooking more, full stop.", "NTA. \n\nI'm concerned by his behaviors that this could potentially lead to an eating disorder, if it hasn't already. He really needs to see a nutritionist so they can explain to him that the highly processed foods he's snacking on contributes more to blood pressure than salting food as one cooks.", "NTA. I was going to say Y T A until the detail about him still snacking on high-sodium foods. Being health conscious is great, being a hypocrite about it is not. I appreciate your sentiment in at least thinking about it.", "I think being irrational about having any salt on your food is more likely to cause high blood pressure than the salt itself. NTA. What a temper tantrum.", "NTA. I don't salt when I cook because I like more salt than most so I let everyone season to their own tastes. \n\nIf his BP is going up and he wants to lower his sodium content maybe 1 or 2 snacks rather than 6 to 8 a day. Plus there are other things he can learn to like snack wise if he's so worried. \n\nAsking OP to stop salting completely when he is snacking on that much doesn't look like he's as concerned as he claims, just trying to be controlling. \n\nHe should cook for himself for a bit and see how he likes it.", "Wow, I'm in the same situation. Wife cooks and I do the other stuff. I recently had my physical exam and my blood pressure has been slightly higher than my normal.

There are studies that show that sodium reduction isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked out to be, and in fact some people have high BP because they aren\u2019t getting enough.

I'm not an expert, but have helped my dad a lot with his diet after 2 heart attacks. Once we found a qualified dietician, this was what she recommended more so then cutting the salt when cooking.", "NTA\n\nShared meals don't need adjusting as a first step.

You mean high blood pressure can be caused by other risk factors?  \n\nWhy did I pick those three?  Your boyfriend doesn't do the cooking.  So it's very easy change to make.......\n\nIf he is interested in lowering his blood pressure.  Get  machine to measure his bp and start cataloging the results. \n\nNot just like the doctor does it.  No!  We are going for qualitative!  \n\nHe does two measurements.  The first when he is relaxed.  The second after he does a 30 seconds of jumping jacks.  \n\nWe shall know the true enemy after doing readings for five days like that.  \n\nNext, a total life make-over!  Not just the salts. \n\nExamine stressors in his life? Job. Relationships. Income. Education. Hobbies. Sleep schedule. Fitness routine. Gaming. Daily activity.  Worries? Does Ms. Barkley let her dog run off leash and your boyfriend is ready with the squirt bottle to defend his tolip garden? \n\nThe goal is to examine his life, what helps him destress and what is stressing him out.  \n\nA good example is found in the film American Sniper.  The dude was pre-hyper tension!  Was it because of salt? Or because he just got back from being hunted by insurgents that wanted to kill him?  \n\nSadly stress plays a bigger role in our blood pressure then the diet. \n\nNext, do a body mass index measurement.  Yes. Its not very accurate using a measuring tape.  But ideally his waist should only be twice the size of his neck.  Extra pounds of fat will stress the heart out way more then a couple of grams of salt.  \n\nCheck this out!  The effects of salt on the body are enabling nerve impulses, contract and relax muscles, and maintain the proper balance of water and minerals.\n\nSo....not getting enough salt will do what!?  \ud83d\ude08 Hahahaha yeah!  Raise your blood pressure!  As the heart now has to work harder to support all the other muscles in the body becuase your not getting enough salt! \n\nSitting around and not giving the heart the work out it needs.  Yes. Heart health even when your body weight is acceptable is still a thing.  Low daily activity such as sitting at a desk all day for seven days a weeks will give you high blood pressure.  The body is used to relaxing. Not having to support the entire body as you lay around all day.  \nSo getting up, walking, and having your blood pressure checked could give a false indication of high blood pressure when in fact.  You just need to get up and walk more.  Maybe lift a weight or start a fitness routine.  \n\nSorry for the rant.

I was worried; in my mind, a (at the time) 25 year old vegetarian who worked out 3 times a week, was within a healthy bmi range, and ate 99% home cooked meals shouldn\u2019t be having these issues. I don\u2019t snack and cook from scratch with a low amount of salt.\n\nSo I got a second opinion. My blood pressure was perfectly normal. First question Doc asks, \u201cdid you drink caffeine before the other visit?\u201d I had drank a large iced coffee during the other appointment and gone out to eat at a Mexican restaurant the night beforehand. But for this new appointment, I had eaten my normal home cooked meals all week and didn\u2019t drink any caffeine. He said either one of those could\u2019ve been why my test was high and my major anxiety over seeing a new doctor probably didn\u2019t help either. I didn\u2019t need blood pressure medication by any stretch; I just needed to lay off the caffeine and salty restaurant food before I take blood pressure tests.", "Exactly. And I believe that\u2019s how they came to the conclusion that the issue was sodium. They lumped everything together and found that people who consumed highly processed foods had a high intake of sodium so they said \u201coh it couldn\u2019t be the processed oils, processed carbohydrates, or sugar/corn syrup\u201d because those things are literally funded by the Farm bill so we can\u2019t cut those out. So instead they blamed it on the salt.", "Exactly. Thank you! I found that many people find that sodium reduction isn\u2019t helpful, and then they reduce sodium intake to extremely low levels - meaning not adding ANY sodium to their foods and avoiding it which can actually lead to other issues which oddly includes a higher BP. \n\nAbout 10 years ago I found the my BP was high (138/90ish) and I cut sodium to a very very low point and found that it didn\u2019t help whatsoever. I cut out a bunch of other food and have had 120/80 or 110/70 readings since. My sodium intake actually increased since then but my BP decreased.", "I'm sure a nonzero amount of people have tried to use chatgpt to create reddit posts like this.

So he may feel like he can eliminate salt on regular foods (whatever those may be), in order to save the salt for his snack where it matters more to him. It's like someone on a (well maintained) diet occasionally having their favourite food, like a piece of chocolate cake or whatever. Who knows.", "Salty snacks always help my migraines. That sounds horrible for you", "Totally! I agree that palates can shift. That is what i was trying to express - to make her meals 100% salt free ruins the experience for both of them, and for no reason.", ">Once you\u2019ve been on a low sodium diet for a while, you lose your taste for salt and \u201cnormal\u201d levels of salt are almost unpalatable because they\u2019re too salty. Also, you can use other seasonings; it\u2019s different but not flavorless. I had to do a very low sodium diet for 1.5 years a decade ago and my perception of salt still isn\u2019t back to normal.\n\nIf you can taste the salt, you're adding too much salt. The point of salt in cooking isn't to imbue a dish with a salty flavor--it's to highlight the actual flavors of the food itself.\n\nYou really don't need much. For example, bartenders and mixologists today are also starting to salt cocktails. For a single drink, 2-4 drops of 20% saline can really bring out the flavor of a drink. And that's a miniscule amount of salt.", "The worst part is that salty snacks were my favourite kind! Enjoy them all the more for me xD I send healing/ positive vibes in hopes of keeping your migraines away~", "Koshering salt has a couple advantages over regular-granulation salt for cooking.  It's \"flufflier\" specifically so that it can absorb more moisture - one step in making meat kosher is covering it in salt and waiting for the salt to draw the blood out, and rinsing it off, and kosher salt, or koshering salt, is the granulation that is designed for that.  And, like you said, that lower density means that you can add more without it being too much.\n\nBut the OTHER thing that it does well is when you DO want to focus on the saltiness.  When you WANT something to taste salty, it helps of you can keep the salt in its crystalline form - pretzels have actual salt crystals on them, after all.  And the big flaky crystals can stay in place pretty well when you want to do THAT, too.", "I could only have 1,000 mg/day when I was on the low sodium diet. That\u2019s less 1/2 tsp for the whole day, most of which was naturally found in the raw ingredients. After that, anything tasted salty, even regular bread."]}
