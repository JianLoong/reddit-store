My 13 year old nephew is nothing like her. Well, he\u2019s confident and all, but he\u2019s a nice kid. My sister\u2019s beginning to rethink her actions and it\u2019s solely because of him. \n\nThis past school year, my nephew\u2019s become a lot angrier. At everyone. It was pretty concerning. Well apparently my nephew\u2019s 7th grade music teacher was a former victim of my sister\u2019s and took her hatred out on my nephew by picking on and humiliating him throughout the year. He only told his dad two weeks before school ended. \n\nMy sister was furious and gave the school hell the moment she found out. I have no idea what went down, but my sister was very satisfied when we talked after. \n\nI work part time at a coffee shop. It was empty so I just chilling, minding my own business.\n\nSomeone came in crying. I approached and it was my nephew\u2019s music teacher. I\u2019ve run into her many times as it\u2019s a small town, but we\u2019ve never interacted apart from awkward stares. \n\nI asked her if everything was alright and she cried harder until she realized it was me. She got angry immediately and asked if I was going to ruin her life too. I remained silent while my coworker went to get our manager. She then said that my sister is the reason she might get fired/not work with kids again. She told me she was just so angry because of all the pain my sister caused and this situation is all my sister\u2019s fault. They(?) can\u2019t blame her. \n\nI was over it because the issue is that she used her position of power to bully my nephew and feels wronged about whatever consequences she\u2019s dealing with because my sister bullied her in high school. I get it, my sister was mean to me too, but I\u2019m not the one who took out all that anger on a child. \n\nI told her that they can actually blame her because she bullied a 13 year old as a teacher. She was all like \u201cbut he\u2019s her son, he\u2019s bound to end up like her anyways\u201d I snapped and called her a fucking idiot who deserves what she\u2019s going through. She cried but my manager intervened. He yelled at me to go home. My coworker who saw it all go down asked me if I had any sympathy for her, I said no. She kinda went \u201coh well I do\u2026\u201d and she said something about how me and my sister are sisters after all. This coworker went to school with my sister. \n\nI can\u2019t stop thinking about this and it\u2019s been days. I promised myself I\u2019d never be like my sister but I don\u2019t feel any sympathy for my nephew\u2019s music teacher and I never did. I love my nephew more than I hate anything my sister\u2019s done and hearing all the stuff he went through makes me very angry. But she\u2019s clearly suffering and I kicked her when she was already down.

Someone like that should know much better and if they can't at least act professionally then they shouldn't work with children. You are right: she DOES deserve what she's going through. She's made her bed and now she has to lay in it.", "I must be an AH too because I feel zero empathy for any adult who bullies a child.

You\u2019re NTA in supporting your nephew, who deserves impartial and kind teachers. \n\nYour sister may have been the AH in the past, and should probably have apologized to this teacher early in the year, but she went into mama bear mode, which is her right and duty.", "NTA.\n\nShe's such a Severus Snape.", "NTA\n\nJust say over and over to them until it sinks in: She, an adult, BULLIED A CHILD. From her position of power. \n\nShe far outdid anything your sister did to her, as a fellow child.\n\nThen hit them with the child mistreatment judgemental side eye.", "NTA. Teachers cannot bully students - it\u2019s both morally and professionally wrong. If she felt she was unable to deal with this kid fairly, she should have spoken to her principal about it and found a solution. Even if your nephew was bullying other kids, a teacher\u2019s role is to discipline and teach, not to bully a child. I was tormented mercilessly for the first two years of high school - I get that it has a lasting impact. But an adult bullying a child is never okay.", "NTA. As parents, we entrust our children to teachers and part of that trust is knowing our children are safe with them. ANYBODY who takes out their issues with the parent on a child is an asshole and shouldn\u2019t be a teacher.", "NTA. So this music teacher's solution to being bullied was to become a bully. Wow. I am a music teacher and this is wrong. Even when I have bullies in my classroom who are current bullies, I only punish them as necessary. Also, it is important as a teacher to try to TEACH them not to bully and why. This woman has a lot of maturing to do. She has to be at least 30 years old -I'm guessing. She should know this is wrong.", "A victim can also be a perpetrator. The minute she allowed her anger to cloud her judgement and she became the bully is the minute she went from hero to villain.

Hopefully she recognises her actions were wrong and accepts the consequences. \n\nYou are an arsehole for deciding to continue engaging instead of asking someone else to takeover. You were in your place of work, that\u2019s not the time nor place to be starting with someone.", "lol it\u2019s ironic how your sister only knows that bullying is bad when her own son is being picked on - so being picked on is only bad when it\u2019s about *her* loved ones", "Maybe it's for the best she does get fired, that is no way for a teacher to act.", "NTA - but your sister is TA and as shit as it is, karma came back at her child which hopefully made her realise she was a shit person.  The teacher was horrific for taking it out on a child, it was most definitely abuse. I hope the kid heals from this, he\u2019s the only victim in this entire situation.", "ESH apart from the nephew. Your sister ruined multiple people\u2019s lives and unfortunately this music teacher was only one of them. The teach abused her power and bullied your nephew as revenge and will now face the consequences as she rightly should.  You however know what your sister put this woman through and instead of saying to her that you understand that your sister was evil and deserves whatever karma she has coming her way it was unfair to take it out on an innocent child, instead you showed that you truly are your sisters sister and bullied the teacher when she was already facing her punishment, especially doing it in your workplace where you are in the position of power.\n\nFrom the comment your colleague made it doesn\u2019t sound like it was a big surprise that you acted this way so maybe you need to take a step back and review how you treat other people.

She needs to stay away from kids - and you need to remind your coworker that if she thinks it\u2019s okay for an adult to bully a kid - then yeah you would rather be liel your sister - because your sister was a child and has changed - unlike them who have turned into twisted bitter victims that take it out on helpless children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
