She got angry immediately and asked if I was going to ruin her life too. I remained silent while my coworker went to get our manager. She then said that my sister is the reason she might get fired/not work with kids again. She told me she was just so angry because of all the pain my sister caused and this situation is all my sister\u2019s fault.

I get it, my sister was mean to me too, but I\u2019m not the one who took out all that anger on a child. \n\nI told her that they can actually blame her because she bullied a 13 year old as a teacher.

She kinda went \u201coh well I do\u2026\u201d and she said something about how me and my sister are sisters after all. This coworker went to school with my sister. \n\nI can\u2019t stop thinking about this and it\u2019s been days. I promised myself I\u2019d never be like my sister but I don\u2019t feel any sympathy for my nephew\u2019s music teacher and I never did.

She's your sister so your parents could probably control it some. The teacher? There was no one to protect her from your sisters wrath and I don't doubt that her life has been deeply affected by the trauma your sister caused her.

If you live in a small town, be aware that your sister is the town asshole to the many she probably negatively affected in high school. Your experience of having a mean sister is NOT the same as having a bully. Period. A lot of people have mean sisters. Not everyone has a bully and that can be a very traumatic experience in your life. YTA on the level of not seeing how much pain your sister caused someone to the point of taking it out on a child. Recognize trauma and in this moment, you're as bad as your sister because while she did a bad thing, I think a lot of us can have sympathy for someone who has been through something like this and hasn't dealt with the trauma yet.\n\nAgain, I am not condoning what the teacher did and she should be disciplined for what she did. But I understand it.", "NTA.\n\nNeither is your sister for getting her fired (she definitely was as a kid but that's not relevant here).\n\nIt is NEVER acceptable to ABUSE a child.

Two wrongs do not make a right. Or is it three wrongs? Did your nephew deserve to pay for his mother\u2019s past cruelty? Well, of course not!  But true to form, your so-called \u201creformed bully\u201d, sister, instead of facing a victim of her cruelty and apologizing in an effort to take personal responsibility as a basis for finding an appropriate solution with the music teacher, your sister falls back on more bullying tactics to get the music teacher fired.  Was the music teacher wrong for taking out her past abuse pain on a student? Yes. Could the problem have been resolved in a way that did NOT lead to ruining more lives and more bullying? YES.  Yours and your sister\u2019s sense of entitlement border on cruelty and the complete lack of empathy you have demonstrated, is just one of many reasons why there is a teacher shortage in this country. I\u2019m not sure how the disciplinary process for teachers operates in your school district but I\u2019ll bet there is an escalating scale based on number of times and severity of mistake a teacher makes.  But I do know that public schools will go to great lengths to avoid being sued.  And I\u2019m betting your sister, with her lifetime of bullying experience, threatened to do just that.  There were about a dozen ways this issue could\u2019ve been resolved. Ways that could\u2019ve healed past and present pain.  The only thing accomplished here was to perpetuate more pain.  So while the music teacher is actually having to pay for her misguided spitefullness, by losing her livelihood, your sister and you, get off scot free.  And unfortunately, there\u2019s a good chance that your poor nephew will either have to turn into what your sister is, and/or continue to face the backlash of your sister\u2019s past(and present) bullying.  That\u2019s what happens when you learn NOTHING from your mistakes.", "ESH, except the nephew of course.  You were overly aggressive with the teacher, your sister sounds like she has an evil side, but the teacher is the worst.  She let herself become exactly what she hated, she proved how weak she is with that alone.

Is it the only cafe around? Or was this interaction intentional?\n\nWithout more context, the AH here is the music teacher and the sister.

To what degree is an adult in a position of power abusing a child  'not truly bullying'? If we take the op more or less at face value, the teacher admits to it even saying the kid will turn out like his mom anyway as a justification. Any differentiation of treatment from the class in a negative manner based solely on who his mama is is 100% real bullying and she needs to be removed from working with children.

That's the kind of person that shouldn't be a teacher.", "I'm sorry no, if You as an adult decide to take out your frustrations and hurt at being bullied out on kids who had nothing to do with it, then you do not deserve to be a teacher. You have no place teaching kids if that is how you are going to react when you see the children of your bully. If anything, you simply ask if you can have that child move to another class if you simply can't handle it that badly. What you do not do, is bully a child, just because you suspect that they're going to turn out exactly like their parents.

You are responsible for your own actions, that includes bullying a child just because you were bullied as one.\n\nThis is what happens when you let things fester instead of actually getting help, you end up taking it out on the wrong person. This child did absolutely nothing wrong, he did not deserve to be bullied by his music teacher, simply because his mother used to bully her. She deserved to be fired. She deserves to have her teaching credentials stripped away if that's how she's going to treat kids. That's not acceptable by any means.\n\nWhat's going to happen the next time she gets a kid that either had a parent that bullied her personally, or has a parent that was just a bully in general.

How common is it for a child to get a perfectly deserved discipline in school and then to tell their parents they were being \"picked on\"? I'd say almost every kid says that at one time or another.

I won't be surprised if such a person went to school to complain he wasn't given an A grade or wasn't selected for the choir or something similar. Said it was bullying and got her fired. As you said, in small towns, people know everybody.\n\nI never said a teacher(or anybody for that matter) bullying a student is alright or even acceptable. But people do exaggerate stuff to fit their narrative. So questioned if what OP is saying is even true.\n\nEdit: Forgot your 1st point: I did grow up in a small town.

Just because you don\u2019t want to address the ugly murkiness of how far reaching the bullying sister\u2019s cruelty has clearly hurt more than one person in their small town, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a non issue here.  Cruelty, btw that didn\u2019t bother her until, her son became a victim of and never bothered by it beyond her son\u2019s situation. Nobody is trying to justify the teacher\u2019s behavior.  But its very short sighted to believe that anything healthy or productive came from the resolution here. I agree that letting things fester is bad.

It's a whole different level of powerlessness if you're being bullied by a teacher.\n\nAs a teacher who was bullied as a child, her goal should have been to be extra watchful for students who were being bullied so she could give them the help she didn't get.

Like do you not think OPs sister couldve been worse at home? Even so, the coworker is either a bleeding heart or just plain ignorant to assume such a core thing about someones character or interpersonal relationships. I dont see how anyone can think its okay to bully a child as revenge for the bullying you sustained at the hands of their parents. Why would you think that way? What like is he his moms little buddy and became her partner in crime cause the world is a big version of high school? Nope, odds are shed deal with his shit less and bully him into being submissive and \"behaving\" if anything is to be assumed. I dont understand the jump the coworker made at all. This must be a very small town for people to act this way and have others agree with them. I feel bad for OPs nephew, and hope his mom is good now also.

I mean, I would say that while it's frustrating, if the teacher was correcting the nephews work, then she was doing her job, just more aggressively than she should have and was doing it to keep him submissive to her and she was probably honestly watching to make sure he wasn't bullying other kids in her class as well.\n\nI think the kid was a trigger to how miserable the mom made her and she went overboard trying to make sure he didn't do the same to other kids in her class and in the process, it went from being hard on him to bullying him.
