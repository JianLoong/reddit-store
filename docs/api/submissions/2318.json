One brought a new coworker with her. To be clear, everyone brought alcohol, and there was a lot of drinking. Most people were as tipsy as me. Some more so.\n\nWhen I have a few, I talk a lot. I don't really talk to anyone, I just talk. It's usually random theoretical questions about philosophy or something. Really cliche stuff. Like, if you go and find all the parts of the ship of Theseus and put them back together, would it be the same ship then? Y'know, just overthinking stuff to the extent I've missed the original point.\n\nMy friends will sometimes engage with me, because when they're drunk, they find it funny. When they get bored they just start ignoring me. Last night I was mostly talking about time travel. I mentioned the bootstrap paradox and started rambling nonsensically about ideas randomly coming into existence and then time travelers going back and putting them in the time stream. It didn't make sense. I was drunk.\n\nMy friend that brought her coworker texted me this morning and asked me if I talked to her coworker at all that night. A little, but not really. Just the hi, nice to meet you, stuff. She said the coworker said I made her really uncomfortable and she didn't want to go to any future gatherings with me there. I asked what I did, exactly, that made her uncomfortable. My friend texted me back that she said I went on all night about crazy conspiracy theories, and it scared her.\n\nI told my friend that I was just talking theoretically, like I always do. Also, what's scary about time travel? I don't get that. She said her coworker thinks I'm mentally unbalanced. She said she'd give her coworker her phone so I can call and apologize if I want to clear the air. I declined. I didn't do anything to her. If she doesn't want to go to future gatherings, that's probably for the best.\n\nMy friend said I'm being an asshole. She wants to be friends with her new coworker, and I'm making it hard. I understand that, but I'm not going to apologize for being a rambling drunk. If she feels uncomfortable around drunk people, I understand, and she shouldn't go to parties centered around drinking in the future.

Good luck.", "It\u2019s not your fault honestly. I have a habit of rambling theories with my friend too", "Yeah OP sounds insufferable. Not gonna lie, when I get too drunk I also talk way too much and sometimes cringe the next day at my own AH-ness. But just because I recognize I do it when I'm drunk and it's not super uncommon, doesn't make me less of an AH. Especially so if it makes others uncomfortable.\n\nYTA", "Yeah I have no idea where anyone gets the idea from that this is normal drunk behaviour and not just obnoxious and annoying. In my opinion OP is NTA for doing that in general since it very much depends on his friends being fine with it but the way he phrased his post sounds so condescending towards that girl", "Your friend's coworker is nuts. If she is an adult she should by now be able to distinguish between hypothetical talks and conspiracy theorists. Like she does never watch sci-fi movies..", "As many have said, you are an obnoxious drunk, but I'm not sure if I've seen it noted, you have the Ship of Theseus thought experiment completely wrong, so on top of everything you don't know what you're talking about", "I don't think it's an either or. I enjoy talking about things like time travel. But someone sat in the corner mumbling about it because they think engaging in an actual conversation is too much work isn't someone I'd want to be friends with. Don't get me wrong I don't think I'd have messaged this girl unless she was my best friend, but this behaviour is obnoxious and boring.", "We don't know either way, if OP is overstepping other peoples boundaries or not.

Lol. My scifi need self would have joined right in on the conversation! \n\nTell your friend that if you did nothing offensive, you're not responsible for apologizing.

They also chose to turn up a while after the drinking had started, what were they expecting?\n\nThe coworker sounds either super sheltered, or super shy. In either case accepting an invitation to drunken card playing seems like an odd choice. If your friend pressured her into coming, this is all on them.\n\nFor the record, drunk you sounds a lot like sober me. My wife and I go off on weird conversations like this all the time! I just get even more enthusiastic about it when I've been drinking. That and I lose my filter, which honestly is more problematic!", "NTA \n\nI do not drink, I do not like to hang out with drunk people. I would have found your drunk ramblings to be annoying and obnoxious. But you hit the nail on the head. Those are a !me! Issue. You have every right to drink(responsibly). And as long as you're not being aggressive, every right to your drunk cock-a-mamie theories. The onus is on me not to put myself in situations where there is going to be drinking. Same goes for the coworker. If she can't handle drunk people doing what drunk people do, don't go hang out with them.", "It's neither here or there but it wouldn't hurt to clear the air if you frightened her with your demeanor.

It\u2019s hard to judge your own behaviour when you\u2019re drunk. If the independent person didn\u2019t see an issue then the friends friend needs to either accept that and stop judging or not hang out in this group. There is no point in apologies unless you\u2019re going to stop drinking at these things. (BTW some people just are different. I love a good discussion and debate but was told once by a friends friend that I was being aggressive \u2026 no one else thought I was but that\u2019s fine - I don\u2019t engage with them like that anymore but I still do with others and if she doesn\u2019t like it she doesn\u2019t have to watch).", "NTA\n\nSounds like fun - and the kind of talk i\\`d sometimes engage in while sober.. \n\nShe was a guest - and instead of thinking 'geez, dude rambles when fueled with alcohol' she more or less branded you a qanon cultist.. not cool!", "Additional question for the OP\u2026 was there perhaps another conspiracy theory or idea you brought up that may be a little more far fetched than your time travel?", "NTA.

Which would be a good thing, for reasons only she understands. \n\nOP was 100% correct to pass on the apology. Best case scenario is it would result in someone who thinks he\u2019s weird showing up at more parties and making him (and everyone else there) feel like they have to be on their best behavior the whole night so the coworker doesn\u2019t have another passive aggressive tantrum.", "I think the friend is the one who is nuts. \n\nThe coworker hung out with the rest of her friends one time and told the friend she didn\u2019t really want to do it again. \n\nFriend is the one pushing all the craziness out of desperation to get the coworker to hangout with her again.", "Clearly OP\u2019s friends disagree as they still want to be friends with him. So who are you to pass judgement on harmless behavior?", "No one but the weird friendless people here care.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. All his other friends accept that, and this friend at least pretended to accept that. If the friend\u2019s coworker can\u2019t accept that, she doesn\u2019t have to come to their social gatherings. \n\nTrying to force OP to change his non-harmful behaviors in order to make some stranger feel comfortable is an AH move on the friend\u2019s part.", "The \"friend\" could think that - but then others would be able to correct \"friend\" and tell \"friend\" where to stick those ideas..", "It's completely relevant. If that offends you then maybe you can do some colouring in. You're clearly upset that people think OP is a weirdo because you're very similar to OP. That's fine, but it doesn't need to be the end of the world to for you to realise that this sort of attention seeking kooky behaviour is seen as pathetic by most people.
