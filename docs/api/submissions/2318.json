One brought a new coworker with her. To be clear, everyone brought alcohol, and there was a lot of drinking. Most people were as tipsy as me. Some more so.\n\nWhen I have a few, I talk a lot. I don't really talk to anyone, I just talk. It's usually random theoretical questions about philosophy or something. Really cliche stuff. Like, if you go and find all the parts of the ship of Theseus and put them back together, would it be the same ship then? Y'know, just overthinking stuff to the extent I've missed the original point.\n\nMy friends will sometimes engage with me, because when they're drunk, they find it funny. When they get bored they just start ignoring me. Last night I was mostly talking about time travel. I mentioned the bootstrap paradox and started rambling nonsensically about ideas randomly coming into existence and then time travelers going back and putting them in the time stream. It didn't make sense. I was drunk.\n\nMy friend that brought her coworker texted me this morning and asked me if I talked to her coworker at all that night. A little, but not really. Just the hi, nice to meet you, stuff. She said the coworker said I made her really uncomfortable and she didn't want to go to any future gatherings with me there. I asked what I did, exactly, that made her uncomfortable. My friend texted me back that she said I went on all night about crazy conspiracy theories, and it scared her.\n\nI told my friend that I was just talking theoretically, like I always do. Also, what's scary about time travel? I don't get that. She said her coworker thinks I'm mentally unbalanced. She said she'd give her coworker her phone so I can call and apologize if I want to clear the air. I declined. I didn't do anything to her. If she doesn't want to go to future gatherings, that's probably for the best.\n\nMy friend said I'm being an asshole. She wants to be friends with her new coworker, and I'm making it hard. I understand that, but I'm not going to apologize for being a rambling drunk. If she feels uncomfortable around drunk people, I understand, and she shouldn't go to parties centered around drinking in the future.

This kind of sounds like what a lot of people do when they're drunk or high. Like, was the coworker super young or sheltered or something? I don't understand.", "NTA. Most people, myself included, when under an influence ramble about any and everything. This new person sounds sheltered. I mean conspiracy theories really? And it all scared her?", "NTA.  You're an obnoxious drunk, and this girl doesn't like being around obnoxious drunks.  Neither of you is TA for that.  Your friend is TA for not minding his own business and demanding an apology from you despite your not having done anything that merits one.  Some people don't like being around drunks, and those people shouldn't go drinking.  I don't know why your friend has to complicate the situation any more than that.", "Unless there\u2019s something else you said or did, NTA.

The coworker is being overly sensitive. But honestly you should go to therapy. I\u2019ve hung out with people like you and gone out drinking and eventually it always gets to annoying to keep going out with them. Every once in awhile sure, we all do it. But every single time? Yeesh!", "NTA - your friend should be more supportive of the situation by explaining to her that you take philosophy and theories.  \n\nIt's hard to believe this person is your friend.  \n\nThe new person I understand.  It can be awkward to take in when you see someone on a rant without an audience.", "NAH but you need to be aware that this trait of yours isn't as cute as you think it is.", "NTA, your friend should defend you and who you are as a person.  It doesn\u2019t even sound like you did anything to this coworker, they just don\u2019t like you.  Not everyone will get along and it\u2019s sometimes best not to interact with groups that don\u2019t fit you.  Your friend needs to accept that.", "NTA, speak your mind!", "NTA . Half the fun of being drunk is talking shit \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 if that person doesn\u2019t feel comfortable being in your company then they can make the decision not to be in it but not at your expense", "NTA.

You seem like my kind of drinker dude these are my favorite topics when I'm drunk, they get you thinking!! Plus, they are just fun lol. Definitely do not apologize, the coworker seems to be the one who is mentally unbalanced if that scared her or made her uncomfortable... That is very much a her problem and not at all a you problem lol. Also, conspiracy theories??? seems dramatic lol I don't think she knows what that actually means... Ngl though, people like the coworker kinda fascinate me because I genuinely want to know what it is that makes them so sensitive to topics that are so objectively impersonal. \n\nAlso, the bootstrap paradox absolutely sends me into a theoretical tailspin in a hilarious way lol it's great fun", "NTA. You are one of those annoying drunks, and you know that. The new girl didn\u2019t know who you were or your MO when you were drunk so you going straight to time travelling probably scared her. The new girl has the right to feel that way since it\u2019s weird to people outside your circle and to not hang out again. Your friend is the asshole though for trying to get you to apologize to new girl to save their friendship.", "NTA. \n\nYou don't sound like my idea of a fun time while drinking, either, but it doesn't sound like you're saying anything offensive and anyway, your drinking behavior is well-known - and encouraged! - by your friends. \n\nIt sounds like this friend should've expected this behavior going into it - in her shoes, I probably would've given the coworker a quick heads up, like \"Hey, just FYI - DrunkPhilosoph tends to ramble about random stuff when they drink, feel free to ignore them if it's too annoying.\" \n\nExpecting you to apologize to this coworker is absurd, and if meeting you was enough to nip this new friendship in the bud, then it wasn't much of a friendship to begin with.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I hate people. NTA", "NTA.  As someone with a classics degree I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of drunks who suddenly became philosophers when they drank.  Is it annoying?  God yes, and it was especially annoying from the philosophy majors, but once I had an engineering friend who got drunk and all he wanted to talk about was world peace.\n\nYour friend\u2019s coworker sounds exhausting and overly sensitive, though, and no, you don\u2019t owe her an apology.  I don\u2019t drink at all anymore (I used to cave and drink socially, which is how I found out I have a high tolerance, but I never liked the taste and I have a family history of deadly alcoholism, as most natives do, so I just decided to stop all together as there\u2019s nothing enjoyable about it for me), but you\u2019re right: if you\u2019re that uncomfortable around (benign) drunk people, you shouldn\u2019t go to parties like this.", "NTA.\n\nWhy would you apologize to a person you will likely never have anything to do with anymore for being drunk and talking about time travel?", "NTA How does theoretical time travel make someone uncomfortable or an ah??

You didn't do anything wrong, and she's within her rights to find your rambling off-putting. You two just don't mesh well while drunk, it happens, doesn't make anyone an AH.\n\nThat said, what's it really accomplishing to refuse to apologize? I'm not saying you're obligated to, you're well within your rights to refuse. But you've said yourself that it wouldn't hurt you any, and would do your friend a solid.

I'm not a conspiracy nut, I just get kinda philosophical and talk a lot when I'm drunk.\"?", "NTA, sounds like a buzz kill and not someone I\u2019d want around anyway.", "NTA either way, but I'm really curious, is it just your friend pressuring you to apologize, or does the other girl expect it, too? Just trying to gauge how far the delusion spreads.\n\nYou don't owe anyone an apology. Sounds like you and this woman just don't gel, and that's perfectly fine. There's 8 billion of us, we don't all have to be friends. But your friend is legit strange thinking you need to apologize.", "NTA..if she doesn't want to come to future gatherings that's her choice.

She looks our age, but that doesn't really mean anything.", "Apparently she didn't realize I was being theoretical and thinks I actually believe all of human history has been rewritten by time travel. And she thinks I talk like that all the time, not just when drunk, because she and my friend arrived halfway through the party when the drinking was already well underway, so she's never met \"sober me.\"", "This here is the best answer.\nI've been around a fair share of obnoxious drunks that other friends have brought around, and I don't expect them to apologize for being obnoxious unless they somehow were disrespectful or intentionally offensive. I just tell my friends that I won't go to small gatherings where the obnoxious drunks are present. No reason to hamper their fun, and i don't have to spend the night annoyed.", "Ha! I'll suggest that.

I get the impression that there are no assholes here, it's just a case of two people rubbing each other the wrong way.\n\nIf OP finds that \\*other\\* people are \\*also\\* annoyed with the way he talks when drunk, then he should definitely take that into consideration. But if the woman in the story is the only person who's ever had a problem, I think we just have two people who rub each other the wrong way. It happens sometimes.", "Even if you did believe all of that\u2026 unless you were screaming about fire and brimstone, politics, or physically harming someone (which it sounds like you were just harmlessly drunk and going in silly rants) you\u2019re deff NTA\ud83e\udd0d", "oof, that's a whole other set of issues", "I would definitely take the obnoxious drunk talking about time travel over the obnoxious drunks that start shit."]}
