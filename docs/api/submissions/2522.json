I came in with my service dog and there was a big line. No big deal. I took a number and waited to be called.\n\nThis guy that was in the line started a conversation that went like this:\n\nGuy:  \"Doesn't it break your heart that you'd have to give him away to a disabled person once you're done training him?\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, I'm not giving him away, he is my fully trained service dog\"\n\nGuy: \"You mean you're disabled?\"\n\nMe, getting uncomfortable: \"... Yes\"\n\nGuy: \"But you don't look like there's anything wrong with you\"\n\nMe: Shrugging\n\nGuy: \"Are you sure you're disabled?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes\"\n\nGuy: \"And this dog helps?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes\"\n\nThis conversation went on and on with him insisting that I don't look disabled to him. Then, after he finished picking up his meds, he came back and asked:\n\nGuy: \"So... Can I ask why you need him?\"\n\nMe: \"No, you can't. That's personal\"\n\nGuy: \"It's just that you don't look sick!\"\n\nAt this point I snapped and asked him: \"So, can I ask you when was your last urology appointment? No? That's private? Huh\"\n\nHe got red in the face and started flailing his arms and finally said: \"But you are not blind! Why would you need a dog?!\"\n\nI just answered that obviously I wasn't blind and that it was still non of his business to ask and to be this intrusive.\n\nThe other women that stood in line told me that I was great and that he deserved to feel uncomfortable after all the pestering, but as I left the pharmacy and told my mom what happened, she said I should have been more patient and use that opportunity to be a good service dog team ambassador.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1668641939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxa2r6/aita_for_asking_a_stranger_for_private_medical/", "score": 205, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm also a service dog handler and I love that you made that guy feel uncomfortable about his behavior! Some people lose all sense of boundaries when they see a person with a service dog and think it's somehow not creepy to want to know about a total stranger's medical conditions. I usually use the strategy of acting like I don't understand what a person is asking when they start asking for medical information about me because I have a service dog, so that they're forced to rephrase and rephrase their question until it's super obvious to everyone that what they're trying to ask is inappropriate, but I might have to try the method you used here in the future!", "NTA.

I like to reply, \"Nothing's wrong with me, what's wrong with you\" Maybe not the \"nicest\" thing to say, but it gets my point across.", "You're NTA.

There is a small percentage of them that are basically lying to bring them in. Or for example one man had a letter from his doctor saying he needed a dog so it would help him walk because he needed to walk. Well he then put the dog on his golf cart and drive to the dog section. The reason I know that is that some people do not want animals especially if the place doesn\u2019t allow pets. So they come to me and complain. \n\nThey just assume no one really needs them and they are just scamming. They think you need to be blind. Other people seemed to think that an emotional support animal has to go with them everywhere and if you don\u2019t have it then they are lying. I have spent hours and hours of my life at work educating people on the facts. I have an emotional support cat. I don\u2019t bring her everywhere but she\u2019s always there for me waiting at home. Unless she\u2019s asleep lol because she\u2019s a cat. \n\nI\u2019ve had more problems lately with my ptsd. And it helps to put my hand all over that soft fur while she \tpurrs in happiness.", "NTA.  You handled that well!\n\nAt this point, I want to make a little zine/booklet that can be handed out to people like him.  Something that explains not all disabilities are visible, not all people who use a mobility aid need it all the time, *why* you can't pet or distract a service dog, and that *no one is entitled to grill you for your medical information.*  Like a Chick Tract, but not evil.", "NTA blind peep here and why are we disabled folk always expected to be the bigger person and always educate others? I don't mind sometimes but I am not people's inspiration porn. I am just a person who can't fracking see and need to interact with the world differently to get by. Anyone can do it, its called adapting. \n\nYou handled this beautifully by the way, not rude but not backing down either.", "There's being a good service dog team ambassador and there's being a door mat.

I followed this person on tiktok for a while and it cracked me up that one day this dude kept following her and asking what her handicap was. She finally snapped 'I'm living proof that stupidity is a disability. So where is your dog??'
