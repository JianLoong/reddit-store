Other people seemed to think that an emotional support animal has to go with them everywhere and if you don\u2019t have it then they are lying.

I have FEELING'S. But apparently my feelings aren't as important as your \"need\" to know.\n\nAnd it's changed the way I live my life. Other than a couple of scars on my face that most people don't notice, all the rest can be hidden by clothes (long skirt, pants, etc). I don't care about the disfigurement and scars. Don't even notice anymore. Honestly, seeing pictures pre accident is weird for me. That's not \"me\".

Only to get completely blindsided by some rando. It's just so demoralizing. It makes me feel like a sideshow freak at the circus.\n\nNothing like chilling at a Food Truck Festival eating some yummy tacos only to look up and realize multiple people in different spots standing stock still staring with their mouths hanging open.

Gah.\n\nSo I cover myself the majority of the time. Which also sucks in its own right. Because it makes it abundantly clear that I get treated differently depending on how I dress. No visible deformities; get treated like a full human being. Walk around a flea market in shorts because it's 95 fucking degrees out; get treated like I'm an object no different than what's for sale. Something to be examined and commented upon.\n\nI feel like I should be used to it by now. But everytime I'm just so stunned that someone just came up and bluntly asked that I just go blank and mumble \"car accident\". Invetibably they say \"oh\" in a disappointed tone and then walk away.

I'm sorry that you have to keep going through this kind of shit.", "i did it more in the beginning than i do now, since i\u2019ve gotten better w boundaries about it, but especially since some of what my SD tasks for is psych, some days the thought of having everyone staring and talking about her to their friends (best case) or taking it as an invitation to come up and talk to me (no matter how nice they may be) is just. Too Much. let alone the people who want to talk all about my medical history. \n\nsomehow i\u2019ve been super lucky that very few people have gotten that invasive with me, i usually just get questions about training and tasks and stuff instead of specifically my diagnoses etc, but it\u2019s still tiring! that said, i do know i\u2019m insanely lucky to never have been (successfully) denied bc of her (tho ofc if that happened i would file an ADA complaint), nor had someone super persistent or rude about why i have her or need her. \n\nmy biggest gripe honestly is that retail workers and the service industry don\u2019t have basic SD etiquette as part of their work training \ud83e\udd74 telling random other shoppers to fuck off is one thing but when the person who\u2019s helping you is being distracting or invasive it\u2019s just so much more annoying", "Next time someone is pestering you say \u201cThis conversation is over have a good day!\u201d and let them keep talking to their damn self.", "And that is the biggest reason I make it a point to teach my niece and nephews about it now when they are young. They know it is ok to look and appreciate the cute dog, but that dog has a very important job.", "oh my favorite thing EVER is when people out with kids will see my dog and immediately pull their kids aside and be like \u201chey, you see that dog? i know they\u2019re cute but they have a Very Important Job. they keep their handler safe, and they\u2019re working right now, so you can look but don\u2019t distract them!\u201d esp if it\u2019s done quietly and just barely in my ear shot \ud83d\ude2d it\u2019s so clear they\u2019re doing their best not to disturb me or make me feel put on the spot, and i\u2019ve noticed that the kids who have those kinds of caretakers tend to always be the ones who will actually listen and behave. \n\ni always try to look over and shoot them all a smile when that happens. caretakers look relieved and the kids look so excited"]}
