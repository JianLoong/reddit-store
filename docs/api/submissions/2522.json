I usually use the strategy of acting like I don't understand what a person is asking when they start asking for medical information about me because I have a service dog, so that they're forced to rephrase and rephrase their question until it's super obvious to everyone that what they're trying to ask is inappropriate, but I might have to try the method you used here in the future!", "NTA.

Or for example one man had a letter from his doctor saying he needed a dog so it would help him walk because he needed to walk. Well he then put the dog on his golf cart and drive to the dog section. The reason I know that is that some people do not want animals especially if the place doesn\u2019t allow pets. So they come to me and complain. \n\nThey just assume no one really needs them and they are just scamming. They think you need to be blind. Other people seemed to think that an emotional support animal has to go with them everywhere and if you don\u2019t have it then they are lying. I have spent hours and hours of my life at work educating people on the facts. I have an emotional support cat. I don\u2019t bring her everywhere but she\u2019s always there for me waiting at home. Unless she\u2019s asleep lol because she\u2019s a cat. \n\nI\u2019ve had more problems lately with my ptsd. And it helps to put my hand all over that soft fur while she \tpurrs in happiness.", "NTA.
