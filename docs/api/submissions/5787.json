About 2 weeks into us dating, I bought myself a PS4 because I was bored and I also felt left out bc everyone on twitter was playing the Spiderman game. However, my BF ended up being the only one who actually uses it. I pretty much only use it to watch Netflix or Hulu in the living room (we have an Apple TV in the bedroom). Despite him using it a lot, I still thought of it as \u201cmine\u201d considering I bought it for myself originally. \n\nAnyway, I got him a PS5 for Christmas this year. I plan on selling the PS4 since we don\u2019t really need it anymore and most of the games he plays is also available on the PS5. I asked him if I would be able to use the PS5 for Netflix and so on and he said yes. I told him how I was planning on selling the PS4 then and he asked me how we were planning on splitting the money. I told him I didn\u2019t plan on splitting it since it\u2019s technically mine. He\u2019s telling me it\u2019s unfair since he\u2019s used it more than I have and therefore its practically his too so we should be able split the money. \n\nThe thing is that I wouldn\u2019t expect money if he decided to sell the PS5 despite using it since its his. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong for wanting to keep the money for myself. At the end of the day, I bought the PS4 for myself very early into our relationship. At the same time, it did become a shared appliance for the past 4 years so maybe he feels some sort of ownership towards it too?

It's your PS4, so I see absolutely no reason why you should share the money. Using it doesn't mean your bf is entitled to anything concerning ownership or revenue of the PS4.

Your bf should be grateful for the PS5, btw, I think that's a great and very generous gift. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm living in a country where marriage doesn't change the legal ownership of a spouse's property.

When I finally caught him red handed (his friends showing up wearing MY things) his excuse was, Well they were gifts so it's no big deal because not like You payed for them in the first place. This boy has no respect for you or your things and I pray to whatever gods you believe in that you ditch his entitled ass. NTA except to yourself hunny \ud83d\ude4f", "YASS PLZ we want to know.", "If you had a car that you let him use, but he got a new car and you decided to sell the old one he'd claim the profits too. It will only get worse with time OP. NTA but you need to drop this dude.", "If anything, bf should be paying OP \"rent\" for using her PS4 all this time....", "Agree. I\u2019m married and if my wife had a PS4 and sold it, I wouldn\u2019t expect to get a cut.", "Give the boyfriend away, keep the PS5", "Sell the bf, keep the Playstation.", "LMAO. This is the best comment I read all day.", "Dude claimed squatter\u2019s rights on the ps4 \ud83d\ude02 wtf, NTA", "This is the good shit. I love comments like this", "Exactly. When he has paid you half of the original price, that you bought it for, then he can get half of money, that you sold it for.", "Exactly. I\u2019d be more concerned about his inability to reason than what happens with the relatively small amount of money you get from a PS4.", "She also bought him a freaking PS5, it's not like he's left with nothing.", "Yeah why is she even questioning this. Is he normally this financially controlling?! It's her money, not his!", "If anything, *he* should have given OP money since he was the main user of smth she bought. Then I could see him being entitled to a share of the sale money.\n\nAs is? He should be thankful she let him use her console.\n\nWeird reasoning on his part.", "Right? He should be grateful he got a new PS5 from her and not act like he is 10.", "Absolutely this. He didn\u2019t financially contribute to the PS4, so he shouldn\u2019t financially profit off of its sale *on top* of getting a brand new system for Christmas.\n\nOP, you\u2019re NTA. Your boyfriend, on the other hand, is being pretty greedy.", "Get that misogynistic crap out here. Disgusting.", "Omg he exposed her to chlamydia.", "This! Problem solved.", "Seriously. Even a 5 year old would understand this. Either he\u2019s exceptionally greedy or dense. I can\u2019t imagine why he thinks this would fly", "From her post history, it looks like he is manipulative and gas lights her. Like 9 days ago she posted that he exposed her to chlamydia!", "It's like someone living in your house and when you sell it they expect half.. because you know.... they used it, too. BF is being absurd.", "So he cheats on her and demands she give him HER money. Sounds like a real winner.", "\ud83d\udc80", "My ex did that to me once! And then told me I cheated. I hope she leaves him! For the love of all things heavenly girl I promise you it will not get better"]}
