About 2 weeks into us dating, I bought myself a PS4 because I was bored and I also felt left out bc everyone on twitter was playing the Spiderman game. However, my BF ended up being the only one who actually uses it. I pretty much only use it to watch Netflix or Hulu in the living room (we have an Apple TV in the bedroom). Despite him using it a lot, I still thought of it as \u201cmine\u201d considering I bought it for myself originally. \n\nAnyway, I got him a PS5 for Christmas this year. I plan on selling the PS4 since we don\u2019t really need it anymore and most of the games he plays is also available on the PS5. I asked him if I would be able to use the PS5 for Netflix and so on and he said yes. I told him how I was planning on selling the PS4 then and he asked me how we were planning on splitting the money. I told him I didn\u2019t plan on splitting it since it\u2019s technically mine. He\u2019s telling me it\u2019s unfair since he\u2019s used it more than I have and therefore its practically his too so we should be able split the money. \n\nThe thing is that I wouldn\u2019t expect money if he decided to sell the PS5 despite using it since its his. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong for wanting to keep the money for myself. At the end of the day, I bought the PS4 for myself very early into our relationship. At the same time, it did become a shared appliance for the past 4 years so maybe he feels some sort of ownership towards it too?

It's your PS4, so I see absolutely no reason why you should share the money. Using it doesn't mean your bf is entitled to anything concerning ownership or revenue of the PS4.

Your bf should be grateful for the PS5, btw, I think that's a great and very generous gift. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm living in a country where marriage doesn't change the legal ownership of a spouse's property.
