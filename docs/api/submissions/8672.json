Your daughter was cold and shivering, why go to anger instead of worried or concerned. \n\n\n\nYour daughter didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come for her. She doesn\u2019t think you would help her.

I mean your reaction seems like there could be a reason", "YTA - you shut that conversation down before it began. \n\nYou have let your daughter down in some way. She would rather shiver than call you. She addressed it with you, and you respond by belittling her.", "There seems to be more to this issue, as there must be a history here. Even if your daughter is being a typical, moody teenager, I find this situation odd. If she truly did sit in the cold, as you said she was shivering, your daughter saying she didn't call you because \"I didn't think you'd come\" is really sad. Even if you called her an idiot flippantly, it's still an unnecessary insult. That's why I'm going with **YTA**.\n\nYou're the parent; she's the child. It's your responsibility to make sure your child knows they can contact you when there's a change in routine or an emergency. Your daughter wasn't an idiot because she didn't feel she could contact you - that's your fault. If you have a bad temper or something, learn to control it.\n\nYou should apologise to your daughter for calling her an idiot and explain that if she needs to be picked up early in the future, you'll be there.", "YTA\n\n*I was so angry.*\n\nUm- why? This is not a reasonable reaction to your daughter waiting for you to pick her up. Confusion, concern, curiosity, even mild annoyance maybe. But \"so angry\"? Thats deranged.", "YTA. She thought you would be angry at her so your response was to get angry at her. Insulting your child is a good way to get them to hate you. Would you treat someone at work or a friend the same way you treated your literal child here? Probably not. And if so, you're an even bigger asshole.", "YTA. In her mind it was better to wait for you for a few hours in cold, than to call you. It is concerning. I bet similar situations happened before, so she knows how you would react if she were to call you. Would you get annoyed that you had to change your plans? Would you be angry at her for \"making\" you drop everything and drive there? Since your first reaction was to call her names, you sound like you have a short temper.", "YTA. As a child of an unreliable parent, it\u2019s much easier to just let you be mad at us than try to get you to actually get off your ass and help us.", "YTA. How did you not know the school was closing early? I get a freaking text, an email, and a voicemail from the school every time my kids\u2019 schools close early.\n\nI find it telling she would automatically assume you wouldn\u2019t show up.

Guess how that worked out?  I developed an incredibly negative self-image, turned to horrible relationships with both bad dudes, bad women, drugs, and alcohol.   To this day, I still can't handle anyone calling me 'stupid' in any way.\n\nThat's the future you've set your child up for because, idk, apparently it was too hard for you to say \"I'm sorry you feel that way, I would always come when you call.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  Thanks for the award!", "YTA, my dad was like this when I was a kid.

You\u2019re the parent, do better", "So you're angry that she was honest that she can't rely on you? YTA", "YTA. Maybe the fact that your go to way of treating her is insulting her is why she doesn't want to call you for help.", "YTA. It sounds like you were either really late or else the school closed early, in which case you would have been notified. Either way, you're trying to shift blame onto her instead of just accepting responsibility.\n\nYes, she should have called but she wouldn't have needed to if you'd been there on time", "YTA\n\nDo you realise that your actions even described by you mean almost everyone here immediately understands why your daughter was reluctant to call you?", "YTA\n\nYou have clearly made your daughter think that picking her up is a lower priority to you than leaving work early.\n\nTake a minute and look at your communication skills. Instead of thinking \"how have I spoken to my daughter to make her think I wouldn't want to pick her up earlier\" you called her an idiot.\n\nYou are responsible for your behaviour and attitude that has made your daughter have that belief. Stop trying to blame her for the consequences of your own actions.", "YTA. \nRead your comment history and you clearly omitted important info from the post- like the fact that you are regularly half an hour late and sometimes even make her wait an hour before picking her up. \n\nNo wonder she didn\u2019t call you.

Makes you think what else she is keeping from you because you have never cared or told her to shut up.\n\nAnd then after seeing her shivering, you decided to not check if she had problems/got her to the car you decided to get angry and insult her. To me, that makes you look like an abuser so she learnt to never anger you and she knew making you collect her early would make you angry.\n\nAlso the fact that she was shivering suggests that she doesn't even have adequate clothes for the weather. Mittens, scarf, hat, thick jacket. You should have made sure she had all of them at the very least before taker her if you knew it was going to be extra cold.\n\nBtw, who the f\\*ck doesn't know when the school closes for their child? They send out a text or email to parents whenever it closes early and if it wasn't closed early then that's even worse.\n\nYTA and I honestly believe there is a 0% chance of this relationship being fixed since it looks like there is way more to this issue than you are saying. Keeping a situation like that from your parent doesn't just happen on a whim.", "I feel sad for your daughter. I\u2019m over 30 and I still feel I can call my dad at anytime and he would help me. I live across the country and I know if I needed him he would jump on a flight for me.", "YTA.  \n\n\nA 17 year old does \\*not\\* just randomly decide their parents are unreliable when you ask for help. What the fck did you do to get to this point?   \n\n\nYeah, yeah, I know, you did absolutely nothing and are and angel of a dad... /s", "YTA - You should be looking at your relationship with your daughter. Seems like she does not feel like a priority or that she can count on you. I say this because I had that dynamic with my parents and have been in similar situations. And I never got over the trust dynamic and the angry responses. You are the adult in the situation - own it.", "That was not a very kind or caring parental response. Setting a name calling precedent or belittling someone's intelligence for a simple, albeit unhealthy decision, was way out of line. You could be concerned or worried and show her you care by buying or bringing a hot beverage, or maybe giving her your jacket or a blanket to wrap up in, something other than an irrevocably dumb comment would have been received better. Hell, making sure she's appropriately dressed for the weather, before school, would have fallen into the 'basic parenting' category.\n\nI'm sure you weren't the first parent in history to call their child stupid, but most parents know to keep those comments to themselves, even if they wholeheartedly believe it to be true. If your daughter believes that you would stand her up, why would she message you, and now you add insult to injury by calling her an idiot to her face? NGL, you won't be winning any 'parent of the year ' awards.\n\nThat was definitely a bit of an AH response to a poorly managed situation.  Words have a long lasting effect, choose them wisely OP.", "I didn't think you would come .. \n\nThink about those words. Don't they break your heart? Your own child expects you to not come when you need her? \n\nYTA for getting angry and calling her an idiot.\nI get that you were worried, but then you should take a breath and assure her that if she needs you, you will be there! \n\nSit down with your daughter.

I can understand being annoyed that your daughter felt like she could not call you. But my daughter has made similar assumptions sometimes - because despite all your comments about teenagers vs toddlers, there is plenty of research to show that teenagers have problematic decision making processes. We, as parents, are supposed to still be guiding them on how to do this better. So I am not going to blame you as much for her thinking you wouldn\u2019t come - this is something her brain created out of a lot of little words and actions that MAYBE was adding up 2+2 and getting 5, or MAYBE she does have reason because you\u2019ve actually been kind of a jerk about it when called in the past - I do not have enough information to be sure on that.

If you aren't aware of either of those things, then it's probably the latter and the fact you don't know it is serious.\n\nAlso\nThe school told you the schedule. We all promise you they did.

All they knew is you would be angry with them for one thing or another, so you being an asshole was inevitable. \n\nLet me give you an example from my teen years to put it in a perspective similar to your kids for you: \n\nIn 2000 a few months after I turned 16, my parents got me a car (out of necessity). Three weeks after having it, I was at work getting in extra hours, and as I was leaving there was a wreck caused by a little old man hitting my car. I immediately went into a panic attack.\n\nNot because I was scared post wreck, but because I was TERRIFIED of what my mom would say to me on the ride home. They called 911 and my mom, EMTs said if he had hit an inch further back I would have been seriously injured.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t my worry. I sat sobbing that it was my fault, they assured me it wasn\u2019t. I told them my mom would absolutely blame me and yell at me, they said there\u2019s no way. She got there, my boss pulled her aside and gently told her I was afraid and to be easy on me. She was nice while we were there. When we got in the car and out of the lot, she yelled at me the half hour ride home.\n\nShe started with, \u201chow dare you talk about family business, and think I would get mad at you!\u201d. The. Went into \u201cWhy were you even working today anyways, you interrupted my work day, and now I have to handle your insurance shit!\u201d (she was a business owner with a competent staff, she was fine to miss the day). She ended with how I don\u2019t think, I\u2019m stupid, why are you crying, and finally asking if I was okay from the wreck.\n\nWant to know how great my relationship which my mom is now? Sucky. I can\u2019t be around her for more than 24 hours. I get a hotel when I go visit even though there\u2019s space at her house.\n\nSo let me repeat myself, in the event that your ears are clogged, YTA!", "NTA\n\nMy goodness so many people not actually reading the OP's post!\n\nCome on people.
