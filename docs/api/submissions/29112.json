My bf (24M) is the nicest guy ever. He feeds me, manages the house, takes care of our fur babies. He's the gentlest person I know. Never raises his voice at me. We have so much fun together because we were best friends for years before we were together. I might add here that he does not contribute to the household financially. I pay the rent , groceries everything. But he takes care of me so i never had an issue with that. \nYesterday I told my really good friend about my relationship. She got a bit upset that she doesn't like our situation and maybe not now but someday in future I would feel the lack of ambition and money. She said that I do not want to marry a guy who doesn't earn. I may be happy now but I would hate it when I cannot get any gifts and he cannot show me love through dates and anything.  So i told her off and we had a huge fight. She's my really good friend and ik she wants the best for me... So AITA here and could she be right? \n\nPs- He shows he love me by making me paper roses, dinner dates at home buy decorating the entire room by fairy lights, buying me slime, roller skates etc. \nI have got him a credit card which I pay monthly so he doesn't have to ask me for money\n\nEdit : Ok I feel a bit bad and guilty for writing this post because some of you are calling him a moocher which is the last thing I think he is..  \nINFO: He had worked in the past as a freelance writer and has earned significantly.. It's just rn after college he doesn't have a job and even if he tries getting one, he is just gonna get a minimum wage job... I myself went into IT so can provide for two as of now... He has no problem earning in the future.. He wants to get into film direction alongside a book writer which is hard to make a career in.. We are just taking into account the worst case scenario in which he has to be a stay at home dad in future.. I am paying the bills as long as he figures his stuff out.\n\nEdit 2: for the people saying it's only pets and not a full time job.. You guys might be underestimating how much work he does... He's making breakfast in bed before I wake up kinda guy..  I have severe anxiety and have issues sleeping... He gives me foot and hand massages daily just so i can sleep easy, sometimes for an hour while we end up chatting.. I don't have to lift my finger doing chores...", "created_utc": 1697541768, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179w3er/aita_for_telling_my_friend_off_for_calling_my/", "score": 625, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seems like she\u2019s asking out of concern for you. I personally would not be ok having to cover 100% of a significant others expenses.", "A lot of people want to write and direct. They work day jobs until they can earn enough money from what they want to do. Ten years from now your boyfriend could still be an unpublished novelist and an unemployed film director, and he'll still be living off your money. And what happens if you lose your job or get sick and can't work for a while or at all? He should be doing more.", "NAH but I see your friend\u2019s point and agree with her. \n\nHe\u2019s 24 and has no job? It\u2019s one thing if you had kids and he was a stay at home dad. But to just\u2026not have a job at 24 years old? To be fully financially reliant upon his partner at 24 years old? That\u2019s a big red flag. \n\nYo I say he doesn\u2019t have to ask you for money\u2026but you gave him a credit card that *you pay off*. He\u2019s not explicitly asking you for money but you\u2019re giving your grown-ass partner an allowance. How long do you see this being a satisfying situation?\n\nEdit: In your edit you say that now after college, if he looked for a job it\u2019s just going be minimum wage anyway and he wants to get into film direction and being a book writer. What did he go to school for? If he went to film school or studied writing or the arts, then unfortunately his best bet is going to be entry level, regardless. Nobody ever just writes and book and gets published or just becomes a film director. Lots of people \u201cwant\u201d to do those things, but it\u2019s a years-long process to get there and there are a lot of dues to be paid. \n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic for him to just chill out and not work until he \u201cgets into film directing or writes a book.\u201d It\u2019s a lot easier to be successful with those things when you have your own income. It doesn\u2019t sound like he really has the luxury of being able to scoff at minimum wage work, given his credentials. Most published writers have or had day jobs until and even after they got published. Getting a book published isn\u2019t an automatic \u201cyou\u2019re rich now.\u201d\n\nPlenty of people know someone who hedges all their bets on making it as an actor, writer, etc. and refuses to get a day job\u2026to their own financial detriment. I had a friend who hemmed and hawed after undergrad because he didn\u2019t want to \u201cget distracted\u201d from going to grad school and opening a therapy practice. Problem is\u2026he never went to grad school. He spent about 2-3 years unemployed, living in his parents\u2019 house, and relying on his GF for money because he wouldn\u2019t knuckle down and go to grad school or get a job. When he finally did get a job, the years he spent under-employed were a setback because he didn\u2019t have the skills to get him a job that earned much. He\u2019s now almost 30 making about $40k in a high-cost-of-living area. \n\nYour BF is raising similar red flags to me as folks like my friend do. He\u2019s saying he \u201cwants\u201d to get into these industries, but what is he actively doing to get that ball rolling? Most people who go to school for those industries have secured internships or contract gigs after college. The ones who take time off after going to college for those things end up flailing. What is his reasoning for waiting until you\u2019re secure in your career to start trying to make headway in his?", "INFO: How long have you been together and does he currently, and ever had a job before?\n\nNTA overall but its important that your bf has some sort of job experience in case he needs a job in the future.", "INFO:  How long have you been with this guy ?  It sounds odd that you live together, have pets together, and have him set up with a credit card, but your really good friend didn't know anything about him.", "NTA - What is with all the hate on a stay at home man? I have one and love him! I come home to a cup of coffee, a clean house and happy fur babies. If the dynamic works then there is no need to comment. A man's worth is not in what he earns but what he gives, and as long as he gives time, love and respect then you're good. Your friend sound a little shallow. Might want to rethink that one.", "NTA - if you're both happy then that's fine.\n\nThat said, it's clear your friend cares about you and people on the outside can often see things we can't. Check with your bf and see if he would be open to one day getting a job if the need arises (you never know what the future holds) or if he'd be willing to get something part time to use for his own spending money while you continue to pay the bills. \n\nPersonally, I think broaching the subject and knowing where you both stand should the situation need to change will be helpful. Especially if you're able to do it under calm circumstances and not during a crisis.", "NAH. It's your life and you are free to make whatever choices you want. I don't think she is wrong for being concerned, though. This isn't a spouse staying home to take care of the kids, it's a relatively new bf staying home to...take care of pets. If that is what you want by all means go for it, but I think cautioning you is understandable. It is easy for us to ignore things in romantic situations.\n\nINFO:  I have got him a credit card which I pay monthly so he doesn't have to ask me for money\n\nIs this in his name or yours? If it is yours and you have him as an authorized user, I think this is a horrible idea. IF it is his, I also think it's a horrible idea but for the reason that you shouldn't be taking out consumer debt if you aren't even working for anything unnecessary.", "If you like having him be the stay at home boyfriend then I don't think there is anything wrong with it. It sounds like he pulls his weight with domestic labor and minds your shared budget. \n\nI do think he needs to work on his skills and maintain some part-time or freelance employment in case your relationship ends or you are unable to work for whatever reason. Without being married, he has no protections. If he's looking to write maybe he can find some freelance editing, blog writing, proofreading etc. To keep his skills relevant for the workplace.", "NAH. You sound happy in your relationship! Your friend might see something you don't, or not. Either way, it sounds like she's just trying to look out for you. If she keeps nagging you about it then she's crossed a line, but she was just expressing a concern.", "He is absolutely a moocher lol.  \nHe has no intentions of getting a job because you pay for all his stuff and his credit card, while he does the bare minimum.  \n\nHe \u201cbuys you slime\u201d (???) with your own money, that\u2019s not a gift, it\u2019s an expense.  \n \nI\u2019d understand if it\u2019s a \u201cstay at home parent\u201d situation, but a \u201cstay at home boyfriend/girlfriend\u201d is just another way of saying moocher.", "This isn\u2019t going to end well.", "Your friend has your back.  Why doesn't your BF work, is he disabled? If so, he should be on disability income.  If not, I can understand your friend's concern, since there are so many jobs out there, so why isn't he working?  Why would he want to have his GF support him, instead of getting a job?\n\nOther than that, he sounds wonderful, but you do want to think about what you want in the long-term.  If you want a house and/or kids, you'd have to pay for everything yourself, which would not be easy.", "It's your relationship and as long as you're happy and all that.\n\n But, why are you the only one contributing to it financially? Do you want a family, are you planning on buying a house, etc? All of these things are gonna be harder to achieve on one income", "A year is not very long to take full responsibility for someone who is not even your husband. It\u2019s cute he does those things for you and sweet,but a little alarming he doesn\u2019t want to do more for you as far as providing towards bills. Also let\u2019s say you want to get married oh wait he can\u2019t get a ring he has no job and then your stick buying your own ring, wedding, future house ! Trust me it will wear on you, there\u2019s a reason divorces leading reasons is finances\u2026..", "LMAO I see the stay at home girlfriend trend has now grown to include stay at home boyfriend too", "You are happy with the relationship, which is the most important thing.  Yes, that may change\u2014or maybe it won't.  Or maybe your man will get back into the groove of earning through his writing.\n\nI would say, though, that it would be very much worth while him getting a job.  If he gets even a minimum wage job, even if it isn't full time, he gets some structure into his week.  Structure really helps.  If he wants to write, a bit of restriction on the time available will actually be helpful.  It's too easy to procrastinate when faced with a blank page and a whole day\u2014a blank page and only three hours left before bedtime is actually easier.\n\nOn the other hand, if he is serious about working in the film industry, he absolutely needs to be doing something about it.  Nobody gets headhunted from their quiet domestic setting to be a fledgling film director.  He has to work for it.  He needs to be working in the industry, however menial the job he starts on\u2014and he is in a great position because you are willing to pay for your household, so he could even intern for no pay in order to gain a foothold.  Even if he proves himself to be a great floor-sweeper or someone who can answer the phone or run around fetching things, he'll be \\*there\\*.  Cooking for you, managing the household and taking care of your pets is nice, but if he is serious about his career ideals, he needs to get on with it.\n\nIf he isn't working, if he isn't actively doing something to further his career, than talking about getting into film direction is just that, talk.  Which may be okay.  What isn't okay is pretending that he's going to be the next Spielberg one day while he sits at home and scritches the cat.\n\nNTA, but be careful here.", "Sorry to say this and I will get downvoted for this, but YTA because you are setting the bar too low for yourself. You believe he is great guy because he doesn't yell at you and that reflects how little expectations you have. Your friend is alerting you to a potential freeloader. You are young and happy now so you don't see things for what they are. Him having this level of comfort + sex without spending a dime gives him zero reasons to improve and work on himself. Unless he is disabled , there is no reason why he shouldn't be working and contributing.", "Ngl if a woman was taking care of me this much financially I\u2019d be the best bf in the world too lol, sis you\u2019re getting used, if u had real kids that\u2019d be different.", "Reddit gets it, no assholes here. My question for you is if you\u2019re happy with your situation then does it matter if anyone else doesn\u2019t agree with it? The Questions you have to ask yourself are: are you happy? Can you reach all of your financial goals with only you working? Can the situation you\u2019re in last into the future? Do you have any plans in the future in which this situation will not work? Good luck.", "NTA- because that's nobodies business but the both of yours, BUT he's 24 he should still have a side job or something to bring in income because it's  2023 and who know when we will have another financial collapse and everything is getting more and more expensive by the day", "if he's not willing to change then it's a problem. not being able to contribute is one thing but keeping it that way and not looking for a change is a sign that he might just stay like this his whole life. he can't keep living off of you. he needs to get his shit together and start helping you because home dinner dates and paper roses are great but they wont feed your kids.", "Healthy communication and love. You guys seem to have that. Keep your relationship details private and continue to be happy.

And minimum wage is better than 0 dollars. I can\u2019t stand how people use this as an excuse not to work at all. Your friend is looking out for you. She\u2019s a real one. \n\nAll of the cute gifts he buys you with your own money.. and how you think that\u2019s just cool how he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to ask me for money\u201d because he pays on a card YOU pay for?? Those aren\u2019t gifts. That\u2019s not normal. Trust me if i could shower my partner with gifts that I didn\u2019t have to pay for- he would have everything. It doesn\u2019t work that way though. Someone has to work to get money to get gifts.", "Team friend. She's right.", "Your friend is right. You say he takes care of you - of course he does because he\u2019s not stupid.

Why does your being settled in your career matter? He\u2019s at your house all day, spending your money, and unemployed.

(We need the details)  Your friend is probably right by the way. This fairy tale looks great at 25 but probably won't at 35. Unless you have some incredibly lucrative career ahead of you.", "NAH. Would people blink if the genders were reversed? You know your finances and as long as you won't feel resentful down the line, keep on keeping on. Just know that you are now saving for two. Your friend doesn't want to see you exploited.\n\nHowever, I've personally wondered why anyone would get into this arrangement. Especially as the house partner, completely dependent on another person for every aspect, and unmarried, one breakup away from homelessness with no savings. He needs to be saving a FU fund and make sure he's still employable. \n\nMaybe you are the rare 20 year old that makes enough that providing for two at this stage doesn't impact your long term goals, and maybe he's the frugal partner that makes this arrangement work and you can FIRE and live happily every after.", "Umm sorry it took me a moment to respond. I had to finish gagging after reading that. Paper roses and fairy lights? Ummm your friend is NTA. But your boyfriend is definitely a deadbeat and you are a fool.", "NTA (necessarily) If I were your friend id be concerned too! They\u2019re a good friend for bringing it up. Even though it may feel like betrayal, some people get blinded by love. The reality is, you haven\u2019t been together long. The fact that he\u2019s so comfortable letting you finance his life is alarming. One day he may be a completely different person and then you\u2019ll be stuck with a moocher in your house.", "NTA. Your relationship, you're fully aware of the situation, nobody is hurting anybody. If your gender roles were reversed, nobody would question it. You're both happy and that's all that matters.", "Not sure why people can't just mind their own business. This is NTA, it's your life and decisions, if you are happy then there is no need for people to dive beyond the question. \n\nI don't know the full conversation but at the end of the day your friend overstepped a boundary and it sounds like they continued to get upset and angry with you over your own decisions which I would definitely not appreciate either.", "Nta, there are plenty of stay at home husband or wife dynamics that work and give both parties whatever support they need whether it be financial, emotional ect. You know the dynamic of your relationship more than anyone so youre totally within your rights to tell your friend you disagree when you are the one seeing what he does on a daily basis ,and if you feel he does do enough for you and to work on himself and towards a better future even if you are supporting him through the early stages of the process thats okay to tell her. Your value for everything else he does goes deeper than money in this case and thats okay. I dont think your friend was necessarily being an asshole by bringing it up, it sounds like she is speaking out of concern and she just may not want to see her friend get taken advantage of because there are certainly a lot of cases where that happens. But i can also understand why you would get upset. If she keeps nagging it could be crossing a line but it seems mostly out of concern from her end", "The moment I read you got him a credit card in his name that you pay for. Yikes. \n\nI mean you're happy now, and personally those paper decorations are cute, it's nice you enjoy them and that you're satisfied. There is a high chance it will wear off as you age and it may not, but this really does sound like a car accident waiting to happen.\n\nEdit to add: it's more like this, as another user said, I don't really blame your friend for voicing their concern, it's reasonable. But the situation is like this (but obviously not this drastic or apples to apples), you get a motorcycle and choose not to wear a helmet. Most people would wear a helmet. Most people would be concerned about you and ask you are you sure you don't want a helmet. It's your choice though to not wear a helmet, and you're perfectly fine with this arrangement.", "YTA to yourself.", "NAH. If you\u2019re ok settling for a lazy mooch more power to you.

It doesn\u2019t matter that you make enough for you both. He isn\u2019t taking care of kids, you aren\u2019t even married. This won\u2019t end well, she\u2019s right. You\u2019re still in the honeymoon phase but soon enough you\u2019ll realize he\u2019s taking advantage of you. I have a lot of respect for stay at home moms. But a stay at home boyfriend that has never had a job before and isn\u2019t taking care of children? Nope. That lack of motivation and willingness to help provide to a household is insanely unattractive.", "I think the main problem is that if you two break up, he is fucked. He can't save money and depends solely on you, would you be able to break up with him if the situation came to that? \nI think neither is the asshole, but at the same time I don't think it's a good idea. And for people saying \"hey women get to do it too!\" Yeah, and it's still a bad idea for the home maker...\n\nSo yeah, more than just happiness, having economic independence helps building a steady relationship that doesn't evolve into economical abuse.", "Yes, your friend is right, or is going to be rather sooner than later.  \n\n\nJust think about this:   \n\\-in a case you all of a sudden will be between jobs for longer than you'd like, what is going to happen exactly, what are you both going to eat?   \n\\-in case you decide to have a baby and you will have to stay off work for a bit?  \n\\-in case you two would like to get married: is he going to get you a ring on your money? well that's just awkward as hell. \n\nAnd what will happen if you are sick and cannot work, in case of some accident?   \n\n\nI was you, when I was 25.

And also walk there since, well, there was no money for any kind of public transport and we had no car back at the time.

However, it is also important to note that life can bring unfortunate and unforeseeable events. For example, if you fall ill for a long period of time or come down with something even worse, or god forbid, pass away, your husband and any potential future kids may suffer from a lack of places of income. It should be important that your husband has some way to make sure that he can make income should the worst happen.

My bf (24M) is the nicest guy ever. He feeds me, manages the house, takes care of our fur babies. He's the gentlest person I know. Never raises his voice at me. We have so much fun together because we were best friends for years before we were together. I might add here that he does not contribute to the household financially. I pay the rent , groceries everything. But he takes care of me so i never had an issue with that. \nYesterday I told my really good friend about my relationship. She got a bit upset that she doesn't like our situation and maybe not now but someday in future I would feel the lack of ambition and money. She said that I do not want to marry a guy who doesn't earn. I may be happy now but I would hate it when I cannot get any gifts and he cannot show me love through dates and anything.  So i told her off and we had a huge fight. She's my really good friend and ik she wants the best for me... So AITA here and could she be right? \n\nPs- He shows he love me by making me paper roses, dinner dates at home buy decorating the entire room by fairy lights, buying me slime, roller skates etc. \nI have got him a credit card which I pay monthly so he doesn't have to ask me for money\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Is he above a minimum wage job? It\u2019s one thing for him to be a stay at home, but between 2 adults there\u2019s no reason for one to commit to staying at home to take care of the household. Most people stay at home because they also have children to raise. Your friend isn\u2019t wrong either, your bf is literally broke.

Perhaps you can express this in a more calm manner next time. Let your friend know that you appreciate her concern... it is noted, but also she should not disrespect your man. \n\nFor example I have a friend who used to be a bit judgy about my relationship... applying his standards to us. He would always comment on the frequency we saw each other and kept saying he'd expect his partner to do everything with him. \n\nIt got to the point where I had to sit him down and make him aware that these jabs were not ok. He may want to be attached to the hip 24/7 with his partner, that is not for me. I would dump any guy that clingy. I expressed that one of the more attractive traits to me was my partner giving me space and support to do my own thing. I stressed that quality time over quantity was what I am interested in. \n\nAfter that chat my friend did a better job of holding his tongue. And ultimately his judgement is kinda funny to look back on now as his relationships have crashed and burned spectacularly and costly over the years while we are going strong after a decade together and continuing to build a life together.", "I would say sit down, have a polite, honest conversation with him about his future. If he\u2019s willing to give his dream a serious shot and is showing that, I\u2019d say stay with him and support him. Most men don\u2019t get that nowadays. That being said, if you want immediate contribution financially, you need to make that clear to him, nicely of course. Who knows though? Maybe he makes it big time one day, and you get everything you want from a man years down the line because you stuck by him when he was down. But maybe he doesn\u2019t think that way, and will leave you when he makes it big. If he does. So what I\u2019d suggest is sit down and have an honest, civil conversation with him about the future. See where his head is and what his plans are. And far as your friend goes, take the advice but make your own decisions. Don\u2019t let your friends opinions from outside of the relationship make your decisions for you. But I\u2019d apologize to her and mend that relationship as well as she does probably have your best intention at heart.", "NAH\n\nIf you\u2019re happy that\u2019s cool, but your friend is right to point out the risks. If he\u2019s a good loving partner, and you agree long term for him to be a stay at home dad (SAHD), then you\u2019re fine. However even if he wants to be a writer he should find work now. Getting a novel published is very hit or miss and can take years to do. He should find work to keep his writing edge sharp. I would also suggest that you make sure you have a prenup if things go down that path. Deal with everything from custody to alimony (offer none). This will protect you if there is a toxic element to this that you don\u2019t see", "NAH, as long as you are happy pls don\u2019t listen to the other redditors calling him a smooch or whatever.

That's not always the case, though.  \n\nHell, I know people who either want their partner to be someone that just stays at home and takes care of stuff there while they alone work (or be that person.) \n\nIt's more common for the guy to be with the job while the woman stays home, so I'm kinda curious if she would have a problem if it was the other way around with you guys?", "NAH your friend expressed concern because she felt you were being taken advantage of.

Your friend is wrong about placing such importance on material gifts as a way of showing love, especially in a relationship that doesn't affect her.\nButttt. As someone who is heavily interested in personal finance, my take is that you will feel this at some point. Not in the way your friend described. But in others. You will need a joint income unless you are making multiple six figures alone. I guess it depends on your goals and expectations in life - but to buy a house one day, save fore retirement, take vacations together, etc. You will each need to be bringing money in. Especially in todays economy.\n\nHe sounds like a sweet, caring, fun and loving guy, and i wouldn't throw that away. But you will need to have a conversation at some point about income. Whether he just gets some part time job and covers groceries and few bills while you cover the larger ones such as rent, etc. But he will have no retirement savings if he doesn't start earning. \n\nYou are young still, so plenty of time to catch up, but your 20s are very powerful years in terms of dollars saved.", "Oh baby, we are the sameeeee people. I just bought my man a truck, and I do OE/in IT. \n\nLemme give you a piece of advice- woman to woman. \n\nIf he makes you happy, that\u2019s all that matters. Your friend is concerned (justified, she\u2019s a girls girl after all) but not all dynamics are the same and that\u2019s okay. \n\nTo give her credit where credit is due, I would ask your man to start working on non-profit type projects and build up his portfolio in the mean time until he gets the job he wants. Ask him to get certificates, project experience, etc. until he gets where he wants career wise. While he has the time, this is a great point for him to work on himself and improve his life circumstances. These situations (when roles are reversed) can easily lead to financial abuse. You never want your man to feel like everything he has is yours. Support him in making this time as meaningful as possible and enriching to his future success. Make sure to bring it up around said friend, remember- she ain\u2019t used to this dynamic. It takes time for folks to see different types of progress. \n\nOn another note- you wanna make sure you bring up career advancement opportunities for him in case something ever happened to you. My mom was the bread winner compared to my dad. My dad was a SAHP. He didn\u2019t have a penny when she was gone and when he did eventually get the life insurance policy, he blew it bc for years he was never in charge of the money. I don\u2019t want that happening to him or you, so ensure he has a fall back option just in case. \n\nAnother thing love, when he does make progress- speak love and happiness into him and scream it from the roof tops how proud you are of his accomplishments. Being a stay at home partner ain\u2019t easy all the time, so gas him up when you get the chance. \n\nAlso- IT ain\u2019t for the faint of heart but I love to see us gals in it and getting the bread where we can!

I do not see where you say she \"called your boyfriend broke\". She spoke of your happiness long term with being with someone not earning money. Maybe she has misunderstood the things you have told her. It seems, as others have noted, that she is saying what she is out of concern for you.\n\nHave you explained that the situation is perceived to be temporary? Is there a timeline for him to find work? Have you given him a set limit of money that you allow him on that credit card? \nAnd, to me, was this arrangement discussed between you and your boyfriend prior to the arrangement to set boundaries, limits, or expectations. Was this something you felt pressured to do in order to maintain the relationship? All of those questions and others like it are important for context of the situation.\n\nBut from the information you have given about the conversation, I hate to say it, but you are the AH for your reaction to her concerns about your happiness because you took it as an attack on your boyfriend. IF she had said, \"he is a broke ass mooch and useless\", then you would NOT be the AH. That would be because you were defending your boyfriend from your friends unkind words that are not true (if that is the case).\n\nSounds like you need to ensure that your friend knows that this arrangement is agreed upon and that you are not being taken advantage of, (again, if true) if her opinion means that much to you.\n\nBut whatever is mutually beneficial to you and your boyfriend, is not the concern of anyone else, including us.

Not one moment has passed where I regretted my partner not providing financially because I VALUE their non-monetary contributions to our life. \n\nThere's a big push nowadays for everyone to be working and keeping things separate but it doesn't HAVE to be that way and it doesn't HAVE to be a more traditional single income relationship either. \n\nThe bottom line is if it works for you, makes you happy, and you're not being abused who gives a toss what your friend thinks?", "Nta.

If you kick him out one day, what would he do? It sounds like he can\u2019t afford rent. Unless you like the power of having him be dependent on you to survive, it doesn\u2019t make sense as an arrangement. \n\nWhat does he even do all day?

You should not have told her anything about the financial aspect of your relationship if you weren't open to feedback. Instead you told her off and got into a big fight over it. \n\nAll of those great things you listed that your boyfriend does are normal things that partners do in relationships for each other, regardless of how much money you contribute. They are the bare minimum. Do you neglect your furbabies? Do you yell at your boyfriend? Do you buy him gifts? Make meals for him? Take him on dates? Or are you exempted from all those things because you finance your relationship. If your boyfriend paid half the rent etc. would you be ok with him yelling at you? \n\nIt's one thing to shoulder a greater burden of the financial aspect of your lives because you make more money than him, its another thing to have your partner be 100% financially dependant on you to the point that you are paying for the gifts he \"buys\" you.

Ideally you both would be earning.\n\nBut where so many wives and girlfriends are still stay-at-home in single-income households, I don't think it is anyone's place to criticize when the gender roles are reversed. Managing a household *is* work, and kudos to your boyfriend (and all the female equivalents) for being well-adjusted enough to be able to contribute as a full domestic partner without being totally crushed by non-employment.\n\nWhile there is a degree of truth that society and employers are still very patriarchal and leaning on male labor is often a more reliable strategy for success, that system also sucks. Fuck all of it. You guys are doing great, keep fucking the system. Give your bf a hug from me, and one for yourself.\n\nAnd your friend sounds really insecure and mired in traditionalist thinking.

Your friend might be someone who places more value on materialistic things, and that's not bad, just not you. Y'all can agree to disagree. You're happy, he's happy.
