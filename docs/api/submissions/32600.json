About a month before the wedding, my brother tragically passed away. He and his girlfriend were supposed to sit at a table with my sister and her husband and their 2 kids, as well as my brother in laws parents. \n\nMy brother\u2019s friend and his girlfriend were then slated to take his place at the table, a few days before the wedding he reached out to me saying that it was too hard for him and he wouldn\u2019t be attending. Totally understandable, so no big deal. The following day I found out that my brother in laws parents also wouldn\u2019t be attending because his dad was in the hospital with pneumonia - again, totally understandable. \n\nAt this point it was way too late in the game to be changing table arrangements, all the personalized place markers and all of that were already in our hands (it was also a destination wedding so we had to haul all of this stuff down there ourselves). It was a buffet/station style dinner, we had no wedding party or speeches or anything like that, so people were sitting at their tables basically for as long as it took to eat dinner - 40 minutes maybe? So my sister and her husband and their 2 kids sat at a table together without anyone else. \n\nThis apparently pissed her off royally, because she made a scene and then refused to talk to or acknowledge me until just yesterday when she sent me a long text outlining how hurt and disrespected and unwelcome she felt because or this. \n\nLooking back, I could have at least taken away the empty chairs from the table so that the painful reminder wasn\u2019t right there in plain sight. But other than that, I\u2019m not sure what else I could have done. Besides, the few days leading up to the wedding were some of the busiest I\u2019ve ever had in my life making sure everything was in order and ready, it was honestly an oversight. \n\nSo here I come to Reddit, was there something I could have done? Am I the asshole here?

It's just 2 little cardboard pieces to put elsewhere.", "I'm confused,  she's upset because no one else was at her table besides her family? Ima say NTA because to me that's stupid to get upset over and after reading some comments her dragging it on and stating that she doesn't want to be around you and your family at family events is just petty.", "NTA\n\nYour Sisters reaction is a bit understandable and perhaps you could have had the spare chairs removed, but weddings are stressful enough without changing the seating plan at short notice.\n\nTBH we avoided this when we got married, only the top table had a seat plan, everyone else had free seating, allowing people to sit with whom they wanted.", "NTA after reading your comments. It was a destination wedding, everyone was seated for all of 40 mins and she was with her immediate family. It was an oversight. You get some slack as you are also grieving and planning a wedding.", "NTA. Your sister had 5 people at her table. Other tables had 6-8 people, it was an oversight and your sister was acting like a brat, people canceled a few days before, you had a death in the family so close to the wedding. Your sister acted like an immature teenager.", "NTA\n\nOnce we set up seating I had absolutely no memory of who was supposed to sit where. I can certainly see this being an honest oversight, and your family just being very sensitive to anything due to grief.\n\nI would however apologize and tell her that this was not intentional. I think her reaction was over the top, but not necessarily surprising due to what was going on.\n\nMy mom and my aunt hardly spoke for years because my aunt thought that my mother excluded her in a wedding event (bridesmaids showed up to an event uninvited and didn\u2019t grab my aunt) and so in return my aunt announced her pregnancy at the wedding and my mom was the last to know and found out from my 12yo ish cousin.\n\nThey were both mortified when they realized what had actually happened.", "NTA\n\nI understand her being sad about her brother but being mad for so long because her table looked empty (there were 5 people in it instead of 8?) It's just petty and shallow of her, she's being incredibly immature about something so silly", "NTA\n\nLife happens. You can\u2019t control every variable and come off as very calm and collective which is hard on your wedding day.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA. How dare she honestly make it only her loss? It was your brother too. Lots of people honor others by doing what you did. ABSURD is HER attitude.", "NTA, but everyone in your family should extend grace where ever they can, as you all heal from this loss. It's done now. All you can do is say that you're sorry she was uncomfortable, and that you appreciate that she came.", "Absolutely NTA, your sister is being ridiculous, they all sat together, plus nephew, if you tried to move or reseat them would you had somewhere for all of them? Probably not! Sister needs to grow up, if you apologised then let her get on with it! Actually no, I can\u2019t see what ou need to say sorry for, you were up to your eyes in things!", "NTA and your sister sounds like a nightmare. She's already married so should know how intense things get at the last minute before a wedding.  Also, if she hated that table so badly, could she not have moved somewhere else? Would anyone have minded? \n\nYou apologised but she wants to wallow. Let her be the victim.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t believe that a month wasn\u2019t enough time to move some place settings around so your sister wasn\u2019t reminded of the loss of your brother the whole time.", "Sounds like you know where you fucked up and are regretful over what you didn't do that you should have done. That makes you NTA in my book. \n\nCut yourself some slack. He was your brother too and you didn't get to have him at your wedding. Maybe sis should remember that before she bitches too much more about having to spend time with her own husband at a wedding.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your family has bigger woes than an effing seating plan at the moment, just one month after your brother passing. And from what you wrote her issue was not being reminded of her dead brother, but the fact that there was no entertainment (aka other guests) for her at her table?\n\nSorry for your loss OP\n\n\nSister is probably overreacting due to grief and will get over it eventually.", "NAH, for one, I am sorry for your loss. It\u2019s not easy to be going through all of this at once. I think tensions still may have been high from the loss of your brother and especially your sister is still grieving \n\nIt\u2019s also not your fault that something as little as seating arrangements would be at the top of your priority list after you lost your brother, planning a destination wedding, hauling all your own personal items and decor down, and everything else leading up to the month before your wedding which is a very stressful time\n\nI\u2019d definitely talk to your sister or at least give her some more time before you do. She seems to still be processing the loss and just an overall hard time for your family rn", "[deleted]", "ESH but mostly her. It was nowhere near as hard to change this on the fly as you made it out to be. But sitting at a non-full table for 40 min isn\u2019t a big deal either. Especially with more room to spread out with two kids. Causing a scene over something this minor is ridiculous.", "NTA if I ever get married I am setting a place for my deceased parents at a table. This is actually pretty common with loved ones at special occasions.", "YTA unfortunately. Sorry for your loss. But this was something that could have been easily settled.

She also should've known that her in-laws were ill and would've been sitting with them otherwise.\n\nLast wedding I went to, my date and I were at a table with one other person. Definitely more awkward with other people at full tables; you feel forgotten or left out. But your sister should be understanding and should've put two and two together.\n\nRegardless, I used to help with wedding planning and always told people to have 4-6 oddballs to throw around at the last minute so no couple or couples were sitting alone if there were last minute call outs. Also, assign tables not seats.\n\nJust some future advice if you're ever helping plan another wedding.", "NTA - your sister could have asked about the seating before the wedding. Or volunteered a solution.", "YTA. I changed a couple of seats the day of my wedding to accommodate necessary adjustments. Took a few seconds and everyone was happy.", "YTA \n\nMy father died less than 2 weeks before my brother's wedding. He was sick, we knew he wouldn't be able to be there. My brother found out a few days before his wedding that my mother was sitting at the end of a long table and it would be extra noticeable that she was alone. He has adjusted this. You could have made an adjustment somewhere. This could even have been done on the day itself.", "You made a big mistake. You thought that personalized place cards were more important than your sister and her family's experience of your wedding, and their feelings. You could have thrown those cards in the ocean and let everyone sit where they wanted and it would have been much much better.

Just apologize for not being more sensitive", "MORE INFO: Wedding planning is huge. \n\nDid you DIY your wedding, or did you pay for a planner?\n\nYour brother __died__ 8-12 weeks before your wedding, and those spaces/chairs were not a terribly painful reminder to __you__?", "Unfortunate events, but you should\u2019ve adjusted it and moved someone \u2018up to their table. Having a wedding is not just about the bride and groom, but also to make sure all guests are comfortable and feel welcome.", "YTA - maybe sitting your sister at a table with an empty seat for your dead brother was a bad move. \n\nTell me the custom place decorations werent there.", "INFO: why don\u2019t you just apologize for the oversight/mistake so you can make up with your sister?", "YTA. Also, the way you keep fighting everyone on here correctly pointing out you let your sister feel horrible because of some stupid shells and your aesthetic makes me pretty sure this is not the sole reason sister has had enough of you for a while. \n\nSome of your guests probably felt super awkward too- if it were me I would have been distracted the entire time debating whether I should go join that table.", "NAH.  One aunt was upset at my brother\u2019s wedding because she thought that another aunt was favored over her in terms of seat assignment.  In my wedding, I had a father\u2019s friend (who I am quite fond of) saying how hurt he was because of his table number.  Your sister seems to forget how difficult wedding planning can be.  That said, I am surprised that no one did a finally walk-through and notice that there would be other adults at her table.", "Why are place cards necessary? Jut let people sit where they want. That's how it's been done at every wedding I've ever attended. Other than the bridal table and the parents you don't need to dictate where everyone is sitting. Especially since so many people backed out.", "I never understood seating charts at weddings?  No one likes them. No one liked them in school and no one likes them now. It costs you more money, it makes you have extra planning to do, and shit like this happens. \n\nI think you are sorta an asshole, if it was so important to have a seating chart, it should\u2019ve been just as important to make sure everyone was looked after. \n\nfuture people getting married, let go of the seating chart.", "ESH. YTA for having a seating chart in the first place. Sister is the AH for being such a drama queen over sitting down and eating a meal.", "YTA for holding a wedding FOUR WEEKS AFTER YOUR BROTHER DIED\n\nAlso how long would it have taken to move fucking place markers around? Like 17 seconds?", "Why do you have to have specific seats in any case? Just let people sit where they want to. That avoids situations like this one very easily. It sounds like a huge case of micromanaging. I would not have reacted as badly as your sister but the option should be there to change seats and arrangements. And it is never \"too late\" to change the arrangements if you insisted on this type of thing. \n\nIt sounds like you were more concerned about the \"personalized\" markers than about the actual guests.", "See, this is why I had open seating at my wedding. People sat near those they wanted to and couldn't blame me for where they sat.\n\nOh, and it was a Destination Wedding (which already makes you an AH for making people spend their hard earned money and vacation time so you get a wedding deal).

Geesh, a little grace.", "YTA if I\u2019m reading this right a child sat at a table with empty seats one of which was meant for their parent that passed away? That\u2019s not an oversight because you\u2019re busy. That is inconsiderate af.", "YTA here, OP. Your family has been hit with tragedy and is reeling emotionally. That\u2019s really tough to deal with in addition to normal wedding stresses. But you lost the thread when you elevated comparatively meaningless wedding details to equal importance with guest comfort in trying times.

I believe OP is NTA, given that by that point, the seating arrangement probably isn't even a thought in their mind, and it doesn't need to be. They said it was during the meal, not that they even had to stay there the entire time. (Hit post too soon) Sister still complaining about it makes it seem like she is after attention at this point. Whether OP had a few days or a few months to change it, why should they? What purpose is there in it? It doesn't change anything except maybe add a couple people to that table or another table. The focus of the wedding should be the couple getting married, not with who or where one is sitting. And complaining about it this long after the fact is just as pointless.

If you said 'multiple parties canceled 3 days ago and with everything else I just didn't have the time or energy to change the seating chart again' that's one thing.

Not a big deal for us, but I can certainly see some people complaining about that.", "Yup. Assigned seating is the worse for host because someone always complains.", "Free seating is not a great call. Awkward numbers of available chairs might be left so groups can get split up.

You were very understanding that others could not attend due to emotions\u2026 and yet, you ignored the same emotions when the responsibility continued in regard to seating fell on you. \n\nThe venue event coordinator most likely would have been of assistance if asked. Such a minor thing for them to set up. With the circumstances being what they were, most decent places would have pitched in. He was your family - but he was also theirs.

That\u2019s\u2026 ridiculous under any circumstance)\n\nThe sub name makes me eye roll that we - as humans - label ourselves or others AHs for human mistakes; however, if going by the sub name, and applying the above, you are a medium AH. \ud83d\ude3f\n\nI hope your family rift can heal, and you have good memories of your wedding.", "Yes, any reason you ask?", "In that case, I feel like this level of estrangement from your sister goes pretty far beyond what is warranted, IMO. Guessing there\u2019s underlying history here, or the grief of your brother\u2019s loss is causing some deeper emotional issues here. Idk. Good luck. I think you fucked up, but seems unreasonable to cut you off over it.", "Op didn\u2019t want to change the seating arrangements because it would have messed up her painted seashells. The seashells could have moved tables. They are not boulders. They are shells with paint on them. It\u2019s about her sister (who also lost a brother) and her husband being isolated at a table. Over fucking painted seashells. No one will give a shit about the seashells. But they will give a shit about being isolated at a family event after a tragedy that affected both them and the bride.", "OP is *getting married* without her brother while dealing with her grief, that trumps seating arrangements. OP is totally NTA & sister is a self-involved drama queen. If it was \u2018too hard\u2019 she should\u2019ve moved the chairs herself or asked staff to do so.", "See I go in the opposite direction-  someone died and she is worried about a chair?  She is angry instead of being grateful that she has a husband and kids, and at her sister\u2019s wedding?\n\nInstead of sulking and trying to ruin the wedding she could have asked someone to move. Or moved herself.", "OP already filled the brother's chair... those people dropped out and OP didn't think about where they'd sat them. Gee, I wonder why the seating arrangement wasn't the first thing they thought about after an emotional phone call with friends who will be missing their wedding because of the grief of losing OP's brother? Obviously, the seating chart should've been first on OP's mind after talking to friends about how much they miss their brother! \n\nThere were no name plates of the sick and dead...

The places were never set either, there were just extra chairs", "We had a whole themed custom sign my wife designed and we had printed on 24x36 foam core for seating arrangements. We had a group that would have been half a table test positive for covid that morning. People simply sat other places and it was not an issue. \n\nWhile I think it\u2019s silly that the sister stewed alone and didn\u2019t just move, it really does look way more careless for OP to have not\u2026moved a couple shells. Switch a couple or two to the empty table if nothing else. Much easier to change on the fly than a sign!

The guest finds their shell at the card table and then finds the table with the number. \n\nIt is way more difficult to reassign seats last minute than simply moving some shells.", "Exactly. The job of immediate family and very close friends at a wedding is to help the couple have a perfect day without any added stress. That means things like getting rid of extra chairs is just part of someone you love getting married. I know there were a ton of little details that my parents took care of when I got married, just like there were a ton that I took care of when my brother was married. I only found out years later about the amount of stress that the cake topper caused my mom that day!", "Agreed, she could have taken agency to ask others to sit with her and her family if she was feeling some way about it, rather than holding a grudge about something she did nothing to change in the moment, at a time when as  a nuclear family member it would be normal for her to pitch in.  Also, it'd be way different if sister was a single person sitting at a table alone full of empty chairs, but she was with *her family unit* \\+ nephew.  OP is NTA", "Yep I would have been glad that they wouldnt be distracting other people", "It was an oversight, not a conscious decision. Most tables had 6-8 people at them, hers had 5.

The venue people just put out extra chairs at the table and I didn\u2019t catch it. She sat with her husband their 2 kids and my nephew.", "Oh there\u2019s a lot of history. My sister is a perpetual victim and any perceived slight is the end of the world. I wanted to leave that part out of the discussion so as not to sway any opinions based on character.", "How is it not easy to change ?! I really don't get it. Even if the shells were GLUED to the table, it would have taken 2 seconds to email someone and tell them \"hey I know the seating chart will telll you you are at table #1, but please sit at table #2\" and make a little cardboard with their name.

I'm sorry for your loss.", "Yes, because moving shells is so much more work than moving pieces of cardboard...", "No but that\u2019s how you acted", "I don\u2019t know what these people are smoking but OP you\u2019re definitely NTA. Your sister is wrong, selfish & acting like a child. Her in-laws are the reason her family was alone & that\u2019s not your problem.", "these comments (as usual) are crazy, lol. Your brother died and you were getting married. I'm sure the seating chart is the last thing that was on your mind!", "NTA. You fucked up but it was not intentional and sister and BIL should understand that these things happen.", "Unfortunately still YTA.\n\nIt was still a mistake even though it was not intentional.\n\nYou should apologize and simply state that you are very sorry for having it slip your mind and that you did not intend to slight someone.\n\nYou are responsible for your mistakes even if you did not mean to make them.\n\nTo illustrate: If I accidentally dropped your phone you'd still expect me to apologize despite not throwing it on the ground intentionally. That's taking responsibility.", "Was it because of the personalized shells that you couldn\u2019t change things or because you didn\u2019t think about it? You post and that comment imply that it was \u201cway too late\u201d b/c personalized seating was already done. \n\nAlso, who\u2019s the 5th person that was at the table?  You have \u201cmy sister, her husband and their 2 kids sat at a table without anyone else.\u201d That makes it seem like, there was only 4 of them and their table was about 1/2 the size of the rest. \n\nI waiver btw YTA and NAH and the comments have only bolstered that.", "If tables had 6-8 and hers had 5 with 4 missing, how was that to work? Did you just shoehorn another chair in there?\n\nNever understood why you have seating charts anyway. I'm an adult, I can decide where I want to sit. Especially for a buffet.", "It was her sister, not SIL.", "Ouch... There is no excuse for that. It takes 10 minutes maximum to figure out which guests can be moved to this empty table (a couple would be fine), than it takes 1 email to the responsible manager, 1 person and 2 minutes of his time to remove old tags and 2 chairs and put new tags there (just move it from one table to another). I understand that there is probably a list of all the  guests with the table number, but it takes 1 minute to text via email or WhatsApp \"hey, we had a bit of a mess with guests' sits, you were originally supposed to be at table #X, but could you please proceed to the table #Y, when you arrive? Your tag will be there already. Unfortunately it was a last minute emergency so we couldn't change our lists. Thank you!\"\n\nI don't understand why you are saying that it was nothing you could do. It really takes 30 minutes of your time maximum and your sister wouldn't feel so awful.\n\nNot removing you late brother's tag and chairs (I am sorry for your loss) was also very insensitive... So yes, you are YTA here", "This makes a lot of sense.", "To be clear, this wasn\u2019t an intentional \u201cfuck you\u201d to her. Most tables had 6-8 people at them, hers had 5.", "It\u2019s not OPs responsibility to cater to a self involved guest on her wedding day.

She still hates me, said she won\u2019t be at my parents house for Christmas if my wife and I are there. She\u2019s completely avoided me for 9 months now and doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s gonna change.", "No I really just didn\u2019t think about it at the time, the comments about the personalized shells are me trying to rationalize it in my own head now after the fact. But in all honesty, with everything going on in those few days leading up to the wedding, i don\u2019t even really know if it ever occurred to me that 4 people who cancelled last minute were all from the same table. Or if it did, I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. \n\nThe 5th person at the table was my nephew (my brother\u2019s son).", "Yeah pretty much. 6-8 was comfortable (depending on the people, we had a few in attendance that are very large individuals), 9 was pushing it, 10 was crowded. We had one table with 10, my wife\u2019s cousins all sat together. \n\nBut since it was a buffet and we had no speeches or anything and were sitting at the table for maybe 40 minutes tops, we figured it wouldn\u2019t matter much.", "My brothers tag was never put out. My sisters table had 5 people at it instead of 9, most tables were 6-8 people with the exception of my wife\u2019s cousins who all sat together.", "I have worked weddings for a long time and it's not that hard to change seats. Also, it is humiliating or whatever to be seated in Siberia.", "I mean, let's be real here. If most tables had 6-8 people and hers had 5, she wasn't in \"Siberia\". You didn't isolate her at the edge of the vanue, people were free to mingle from table to table. Practically speaking, she had the whole table to her immediate family while still having space to invite over whoever she, BIL, and the kids wanted to their table. It's like the best of both worlds and the most ideal table seating in a party IMO.\n\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Sister is NTA and totally overreacted. So did many of the commenters here. (Now here comes the downvotes.)", "Yea, I don't understand all the YTAs either. I think part of the problem is that OP'S first comments focused on the place cards. Logistically, there isn't necessarily anyone that could have been moved that wouldn't have been a reminder that she's sitting with someone else instead of her brother.", "Then she is the AH for not accepting a heartfelt apology.\n\nLike I said mistakes happen and you apologize even if it was an accident. Otherwise you are an AH. Her acting childish and petty after that moves this in the ESH or NTA (since you apologized) territory.", "NAH-I am giving you the benefit of the doubt t that it is not about moving shells (because then you would def be an asshole). I can see in all of the traveling and last minute changes her having her own table didn\u2019t click.\n\nBut give her lots of grace, she is NAH either.  You all grieving and sitting alone at the table was probably a stark reminder her brother wasn\u2019t there.\n\nAcknowledge her pain with no excuses, tell her you love her, and don\u2019t spend the next two decades telling her she ruined your wedding.  I am very sorry for your loss, it is very hard, be kind to each other.", "I don't understand why you are being downvoted that much. Moving people would have just made the other tables smaller than hers. So what's the difference between her table having 5 or the table you move a couple from having 5.  Being with a random couple they didn't know wouldn't have been better. \n\n\nWere there people who could have easily been moved that knew your sister and wouldn't have left someone else alone at a table?", "Yeah, but it doesn't really matter how many people were sitting in other places... As soon as you know 4 people are out - it's it reasonable to take a look at the sitting plan?\n\nIt was a big fuckup in your wedding organization, you left your sister's family a) alone and isolated from all the other guests b) with a big reminder just in front of her of your late brother. It's not cool. I would be really disappointed if I were her.\n\nETA: I understand that you didn't do it intentionally, but anyway it was not okay.", "She was at a prominent table, which was projected to be at capacity until the other people at the table died or were hospitalized. \n\nIt has nothing to do with aesthetics and much more to do with bandwidth\u2014 that this was a huge issue, choose who to move, message them, confirm understanding of the message, deal with it the day of\u2026 and it\u2019s a buffet dinner. And the other ppl supposed to be at the table died, were widowed, may die, and may be widowed.\n\n The sister is simply wrong here.", "But was it a heartfelt apology ? I know plenty of people really good at non-apologies and he says he does not like his sister and the tone of the post is very much she's making a fuss about nothing ??", "Moving 2 people from a table with 8 so the sister's table had 7 and the other table had 6? Not exactly sure what that accomplishes?", "I can see that the sister is wrong here. Weddings bring out the best and worst in people.", "It all depends if they apologized or not. Honestly it seems like a shitty situation all around.\n\nTbh yeah 3 days before my wedding changing the seating order would have maybe escaped my mind as well. Because you are kinda busy and seating ist also not the first thing on my mind if 3 people cancel due to death in family. Then again I can see how sister would feel isolated.\n\nHence apologize for mistake.\n\nBut this is kind of a stupid thing to twist panties over from sister. Taking offence for 9 months kinda does not fit the crime as stated by OP.\n\nWithout actually being there it could be anything from YTA over ESH or NAH or NTA. But that is kinda normal here since we only hear OP.", "First - not isolating her sister's family from everyone else. Second - they won't be stuck alone with the reminder about her brother.\n\nWhy everyone is stuck on the number of chairs, it's not the point here, but it's the social context that matters here.", "I feel like basically everything will be a reminder. It sucks, but it was a major loss. Who could have they moved that didn't remind them of who wasn't sitting there?\n\n\nParents moved so they weren't sitting with grandparents anymore? Reminder. Family of 4 moved so that another table only has 4 people left? Reminder. Sitting with a couple they don't know very well? Reminder. \n\n\nEmotions are running high and there is nothing that's not going to remind them that their brother/son/cousin isn't here to celebrate."]}
