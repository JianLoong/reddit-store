About a month before the wedding, my brother tragically passed away. He and his girlfriend were supposed to sit at a table with my sister and her husband and their 2 kids, as well as my brother in laws parents. \n\nMy brother\u2019s friend and his girlfriend were then slated to take his place at the table, a few days before the wedding he reached out to me saying that it was too hard for him and he wouldn\u2019t be attending. Totally understandable, so no big deal. The following day I found out that my brother in laws parents also wouldn\u2019t be attending because his dad was in the hospital with pneumonia - again, totally understandable. \n\nAt this point it was way too late in the game to be changing table arrangements, all the personalized place markers and all of that were already in our hands (it was also a destination wedding so we had to haul all of this stuff down there ourselves). It was a buffet/station style dinner, we had no wedding party or speeches or anything like that, so people were sitting at their tables basically for as long as it took to eat dinner - 40 minutes maybe? So my sister and her husband and their 2 kids sat at a table together without anyone else. \n\nThis apparently pissed her off royally, because she made a scene and then refused to talk to or acknowledge me until just yesterday when she sent me a long text outlining how hurt and disrespected and unwelcome she felt because or this. \n\nLooking back, I could have at least taken away the empty chairs from the table so that the painful reminder wasn\u2019t right there in plain sight. But other than that, I\u2019m not sure what else I could have done. Besides, the few days leading up to the wedding were some of the busiest I\u2019ve ever had in my life making sure everything was in order and ready, it was honestly an oversight. \n\nSo here I come to Reddit, was there something I could have done?

Ima say NTA because to me that's stupid to get upset over and after reading some comments her dragging it on and stating that she doesn't want to be around you and your family at family events is just petty.", "NTA\n\nYour Sisters reaction is a bit understandable and perhaps you could have had the spare chairs removed, but weddings are stressful enough without changing the seating plan at short notice.\n\nTBH we avoided this when we got married, only the top table had a seat plan, everyone else had free seating, allowing people to sit with whom they wanted.", "NTA after reading your comments. It was a destination wedding, everyone was seated for all of 40 mins and she was with her immediate family. It was an oversight. You get some slack as you are also grieving and planning a wedding.", "NTA. Your sister had 5 people at her table. Other tables had 6-8 people, it was an oversight and your sister was acting like a brat, people canceled a few days before, you had a death in the family so close to the wedding.

I can certainly see this being an honest oversight, and your family just being very sensitive to anything due to grief.\n\nI would however apologize and tell her that this was not intentional. I think her reaction was over the top, but not necessarily surprising due to what was going on.\n\nMy mom and my aunt hardly spoke for years because my aunt thought that my mother excluded her in a wedding event (bridesmaids showed up to an event uninvited and didn\u2019t grab my aunt) and so in return my aunt announced her pregnancy at the wedding and my mom was the last to know and found out from my 12yo ish cousin.\n\nThey were both mortified when they realized what had actually happened.", "NTA\n\nI understand her being sad about her brother but being mad for so long because her table looked empty (there were 5 people in it instead of 8?)

You can\u2019t control every variable and come off as very calm and collective which is hard on your wedding day.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA. How dare she honestly make it only her loss?

It\u2019s not easy to be going through all of this at once. I think tensions still may have been high from the loss of your brother and especially your sister is still grieving \n\nIt\u2019s also not your fault that something as little as seating arrangements would be at the top of your priority list after you lost your brother, planning a destination wedding, hauling all your own personal items and decor down, and everything else leading up to the month before your wedding which is a very stressful time\n\nI\u2019d definitely talk to your sister or at least give her some more time before you do.

Also, the way you keep fighting everyone on here correctly pointing out you let your sister feel horrible because of some stupid shells and your aesthetic makes me pretty sure this is not the sole reason sister has had enough of you for a while. \n\nSome of your guests probably felt super awkward too- if it were me I would have been distracted the entire time debating whether I should go join that table.", "NAH.  One aunt was upset at my brother\u2019s wedding because she thought that another aunt was favored over her in terms of seat assignment.  In my wedding, I had a father\u2019s friend (who I am quite fond of) saying how hurt he was because of his table number.  Your sister seems to forget how difficult wedding planning can be.

Whether OP had a few days or a few months to change it, why should they? What purpose is there in it? It doesn't change anything except maybe add a couple people to that table or another table. The focus of the wedding should be the couple getting married, not with who or where one is sitting. And complaining about it this long after the fact is just as pointless.

Not a big deal for us, but I can certainly see some people complaining about that.", "Yup. Assigned seating is the worse for host because someone always complains.", "Free seating is not a great call. Awkward numbers of available chairs might be left so groups can get split up. People mill about not knowing where to go. People who don't know many other guests can feel a bit lost and uncomfortable.

It would genuinely not cross my mind at all.\n\nYes it sucks she had to look at her brother\u2019s empty chair but come on, his loss would be obvious the whole damn wedding. It\u2019s a month since he died, it\u2019s really all anyone who loved him would be thinking about. This isn\u2019t about the chair, sister is projecting her grief hard onto OP and tbh it\u2019s a bit unreasonable (although understandable).\n\nSister\u2019s emotional response gets a pass because her brother died but you\u2019re seriously not going to give OP the same grace when maybe not considering absolutely everything she should be at this time? SMH.", "The implication is that the sister should stop being a self centred prima donna about there being one fewer person at her table.", "It seems unlikely that the Groom personally laid every table setting.", "Everyone was looked after, unfortunately deaths and hospitalisations can fuck up the best laid plans.\n\nDecent human beings acknowledge that and don't try to make it about themselves.", "Lots of people have chairs and empty spaces to represent passed away folks or people who can't make it.", "You clearly aren't an egocentric drama queen.", "You need about 10% extra seats if you go this way because people won\u2019t fill tables efficiently and you\u2019ll have a bunch of 1 or 2 empty seats", "U couldn't have moved 1 or two people around and made the tables smaller?", "There was no chaos. Every one was seated in groups they wanted to be in. There was  even some table mingling. If you do a seating plan there will always be arguments and some people not wanting to sit with each other etc.", "Oof I didn\u2019t read the 9 months part, I thought this happened more recently", "yo i\u2019m really sorry about your loss. i cannot even imagine that kind of devastation coupled with the joy of your marriage and how complicated all of those emotions must be. you clearly also care about whether or not you\u2019re TA. i think due to grief, which i know firsthand does unimaginable things to people, NAH. i hope you are able to find as much joy at this time as possible and work through everything going on. i wish you all healing and happiness.", "She's a guest, so she can sit down, shut up, and stop trying to make it all about her.", "Indeed it does... But even without that they specifically brought down place cards for people that weren't coming, gave them to her staff and never mentioned they knew a bunch of people weren't coming. Just seems to me it would have been easy to tighten up the arrangements and skip a table even last minute. I think overall I've landed at NAH, maybe some over reaction to a mild oversight.", "It's the OP's brother as well, and she had all kinds of other stress going on as well.", "Op  they didn't put the name plates down", "To add to this, her fil is in hospital with phenomena. \nLike they are going through a lot.", "I mean, probably not literally\u2026", "Right?\n\nNTA but do brides truly think that anyone is going to say \"Well that 1 shell was out of place, this entire wedding was a complete disaster\"", "The sister would\u2019ve known why the chairs were empty considering the brother that died was also her brother and the dad that was sick was her husbands father.", "I seriously don't understand what was wrong. They had five people  at their table and the other tables had 6-8 so it's not like the table was just 2 people. It was a only a 40-minute meal, It's not like they were there for 6 hours alone. Heck even  if it was a longer dinner they  could get up and walk to each other's tables.", "That sounds like there weren\u2019t enough seats. There should be a few extra if you go this route.", "As an extreme introvert, that sounds like my worst nightmare.\n\nThe vast majority of weddings I've gone to have put people who know each other/are related together. At my brother's wedding they tried to do something more creative and put people next to other guests they didn't know but had something in common with. My partner and I were put in between the bride's maternal grandparents and her paternal grandparents - who hated each other. At least we had each other. But my single, gay uncle was put next to the bride's married gay uncles on one side (I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, they said it was because they all like to travel, but I was definitely side-eyeing \"gay corner\"...) and didn't know anyone else at his table. Just a really awful way to do it.", "Yeah I think free seating is a PITA. Lots of people hesitate to sit because they don\u2019t want to take the \u201cgood tables\u201d that are traditionally reserved for close family. Then you\u2019re supposed to be saving six seats for the rest of your group but a nice couple (who clearly don\u2019t know anyone else) ask if they can sit with you at what looks like an empty table, & you\u2019d really rather sit with the people you\u2019re saving the seats for, but you\u2019ll look like an a-hole if you say, \u201cActually, this whole empty table is being saved.\u201d", "I did free seating for 120 people and it worked beautifully. We had three large tables plus the immediate family table. The only precaution we took was arranging a seafood lunch a couple days before with all the young family and friends from different places, so they could meet and the day of the wedding would know each other already. \n\nFor the record, weddings are Kind Of A Big Deal where I am from so you have to serve \"luxury\" food all day and night. You start with fancy hors d'oeuvres right after the ceremony, then first course is unlimited seafood mixes and lobster MUST be included, then seafood cream, then fresh fish, then a sherbet and then the meat course which lowest grade acceptable is fillet mignon (we served a rare local fully free breed of goat, and filet mignon for the children), and then after the boozing and dancing a buffet dinner is served. \n\nIt's been 16 years, my ex husband is planning his second wedding already, and people are still talking about our wedding... in a good way. If you provide good food and entertainment no one cares about finding their own place.", "> Of course you didn\u2019t notice.\n\nYeah... if I were OP, as soon as I signed whatever document it was that finalized the chair rental, I would have immediately forgotten about not only whatever the arrangement was, but the entire concept of seating, because it's been settled and I have a million other things that have not been.", "It was never on the table. The shells were on a separate table, guest found their shell and it had their table number written on it so that they knew where to go and sit. We obviously didn\u2019t put out my brothers shell", "This is an unhinged take. I see it escapes you that OP also lost her brother and was/is grieving? These comments are nuts.", "OP probably had a decorative seating chart printed or had decorative lists printed for each table, so she would have been manually crossing stuff out & rewriting it on a decorative item. So it\u2019s not that she literally could not have done it, but it also would have been highly visible who she moved around & that it was a last-minute thing.", "you really don\u2019t get it", "No placecards were ever put out for anyone that we knew wasn\u2019t coming. The plates were put all together on a table with the persons name and table number on it. I actually wish we had laid them out at each individual table because then I would have noticed it.", "Yup. Change the subject. Classic.", "There\u2019s some serious main character energy coming from the sister.", "Typical AITAH practice of inventing stuff to try and inflate their weak argument.", ">See I go in the opposite direction- someone died and she is worried about a chair? \n\nThe chair that her *dead brother* was supposed to sit in, only he isn't, because he's effing *dead*? Yeah, I can actually see how that could be a bit disturbing, yes.", "[deleted]", "Even with a few extra seats than there are people, you aren\u2019t guaranteed that there\u2019ll be seats together for everyone\u2019s groups (including groups of just 2) after others sit", "Exactly, to properly do free seating and have it comfortable for guests you need to basically double the amount of tables/chairs. NTA at all OP", "I'm glad it worked out for you! Though the seating wouldn't be something that would ruin someone's view of your wedding, so I doubt you would be aware if they felt some of the awkwardness that my comment was about. Like who would go up to the bride and say, \"Great food and everything, but I had a hard time finding a table\"? But your prep for it sounds like it lended itself well to the situation.", "May I ask where you\u2019re from?", "Because it really wasn't. Having those extra chairs replaced with other guests or just removed ahead of time might have helped, but her freaking out about it for close to a year is ridiculous. She is your sister, you both experienced a huge loss and instead of doing her best to make this day (this day that is stressful in the best of times and was supposed to be 100% joy but was then irrevocably tinged with loss) was as happy as it could be, she decides that what she needs to do is make a scene at your wedding and then block all contact for 9 months, only breaking it to tell you that she's still stuck on 4 empty chairs. \n\nShe knows other people at the wedding. If it were such a big deal to her, she could have taken three seconds to say \"hey sitting at the table with the empty chairs has me missing bro. Do you mind if I1) ask the staff to move those chairs? 2) ask Cousin Janie and Uncle Pete to come sit at our table?\" There is whole ass staff and even a whole bridal party to assist in the actual moving of the chairs and plates if it was going to be too much effort for Cousin Jane and Uncle Pete to pick up their plates and glasses.\n\nNTA.", "Except for the part where you stated OUTRIGHT that it was \"too late in the game\" to make changes, which says you did actually think about it.\n\nYou were, at the very least, aware of it on some level.\n\nI don't necessarily think you were an asshole, but I do think that you could have stopped and thought a little.", "Eh, I don't think you did anything wrong/hurtful. Just a series of events that made them feel uncomfortable. I'd offer up a sorry and explain but yeah definitely not an asshole. Have a good one happy marriage", "That was my Thanksgiving-  empty chair for a loved one who died.  \n\nI didn\u2019t punish my family for nine months.", "Okay say it\u2019s disturbing. So what. It wasn\u2019t intentional.", "You're talking to the bride - she literally had to try to come up with ways to fill the seats her dead brother should have been in. Give your head a shake. Presumably, older sister got to actually HAVE their brother at her wedding!", "It was her dead brother too. Have some compassion. But by your attitude I think we just found the entitled sister who tried to make the weddings all about her and where she was sitting. SMH", "I got married 5\u2019 from the seat where my brother was supposed to sit. I put his hat and sunglasses there as a reminder that he WAS there with me. The chairs at the table were left there accidentally and I didn\u2019t catch it.", "Yes, because in all of this, losing her brother, getting married, having people drop out last minute, OP's first and most important priority at all times should have been the seating chart... it was an honest oversight. The only thing put out that shouldn't have been was the chairs. Jesus I swear people on this sub will call you an AH if you're not perfectly perfect at all times.", "I'm from Northern Spain. Weddings are a big deal in all of Spain, but the North is... different. For my wedding, I let my MIL dictate everything since my mom is unmarried and I had no idea, so I just did what she said and it turned out fucking great.", "She didn\u2019t fuck up at all", "Apologising is only necessary if the offended person is rational.\n\nThe sister should have been thinking \"oh my god, my brother is getting married without his brother being there, how can I make things easier\", not \"how can I make this about me\".", "goddamn you're insufferable", "Because if you don\u2019t assign seats you need to have like 20% extra tables.", "No, that\u2019s just me trying to rationalize it to myself after the fact. I really don\u2019t ever remember it dawning on me that 4 people from the same table canceled last minute, and that all those people were sitting at my sisters table.", "Make's it worse", "[deleted]", "You mean same table your sister was sitting at? \n\nYou know, it\u2019s not uncommon to have a pic or something from a deceased family member to show they are still with us but usually they are set at their own table as a remembrance. Not at the same table where the living are supposed to sit. \n\nI kind of understand your sister a bit more now. That sounds hella uncomfortable, even if it was my own sibling.", "It didn't. You can't blame yourself for hysterical numpties, even if they are family.", "This might be the single worst take I\u2019ve ever seen on this sub, jfc", "No not at the table, at the end of the front row during the ceremony only. That was actually my parents idea, I thought it was a good way to remember that he was still there with us. After the ceremony his son took his hat and glasses and put them away.", "Except that the empty seats belonged to her dead brother and hospitalized father in law. It\u2019s not about the empty chairs, it\u2019s about the people who weren\u2019t sitting in them. I think the sister is slightly more the AH here because she held onto it for so long but damn the idea of how she must have felt during that dinner next to all those empty chairs. I feel some compassion for her in that moment even if she\u2019s wrong now.", "Sister was seated with the reminder of her brother's death instead of having others to talk to", "I'd say the sister's NTA either but she went no contact with OP for NINE MONTHS over this. It's past grace.", "Her immediate family aren't people to talk to? Let's not infantilize her or treat her like a total stranger by her lonesome here. She was there with her family. She had people she knew sitting at the table with her.\n\n\nPersonally, I think it would have been a lot more awkward to be seaten with random strangers at a table when I was supposed to be seated with family members who had passed away/was sick and couldn't make it. I would much rather find empty seats at my table that I could fill up with favorite people I could nab myself from other tables.", "Esh but almost YTA\n\nYes, she was absolutely wrong to make a scene at your wedding. \n\nHowever, you seem to keep forgetting your sister lost a brother as well. Maybe she was struggling with his absence at the next big family event as well and it felt like to her you were throwing it in her face. She should have handled it better, but how much time would it had taken you to adjust the chart? Removing the extra chairs would have only highlighted the fact people were missing.", "Idk, but it doesn't seem like a good idea to put your brother's friend and girlfriend in his place... How would you feel being the substitute for someone you really care about?", "NAH\n\nReply to her text. Apologize for making her feel that way. You care about her, so let her know that you would never intentionally hurt her feelings. Stop justifying or explaining why, that's not the point. You aren't responsible for how she felt or feels, but you can acknowledge that your mistake was to blame. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. My then husband and I were last-minute shuffle arounds at a friends wedding. And this was for a sit-down, served dinner. It really sucked. We were stuck at a table with older people we did not know for the sake of balancing numbers. It was really disappointing, because I was looking forward to sitting with all my ex\u2019s friends and catching up (it was out of town for us), and instead we were with strangers while the rest of the group socialized. We saw them later, of course, and we didn\u2019t complain, but the night wasn\u2019t as enjoyable as we expected. Your sister sounds like a cow.", "NTA! You probably could have done something if you didn't already have a million other things to do. It was supposed to be one of the happiest days of your life, but it was marred by your brother's recent death.", "Nah no different than if u had ppl to sit and they didn\u2019t show up.", "NTA, so much going on that you can\u2019t possibly cover everything.", "NTA your sister is acting like she\u2019s the only one that lost a brother. \n\nSeating arrangements are at the wayyyy bottom of the mental list days before a wedding, especially with everything else you had going on, and as your sister she should\u2019ve jumped into action to move the chairs, not make it your job as the bride. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, and I\u2019m sorry that your sister is making it harder by displacing her feelings of grief on you as anger. I hope that you have a healthy, happy, and healing holiday season and 2024 \u2764\ufe0f", "NAH. Your sister is also grieving your brother. She may have overreacted, but it must have been tough sitting there alone knowing he should\u2019ve been there. There weren\u2019t even other people to talk too. It would have been nice if you could\u2019ve moved things around, but you were busy yourself.", "No one is TA here.  Grief gets misdirected all the time.  Both of you were/are grieving. What an emotional rollercoaster!  Congrats on the wedding and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nRegardless of how easy or difficult it would have been to rearrange your completed seating arrangements, I can totally see why it wouldn\u2019t have crossed your mind with everything else you had going on.\n\nThat being said, grief affects everyone differently. Sometimes that unfortunately means getting unreasonably angry with loved ones. That may not be the case with your sister, but I\u2019ve definitely seen it happen.", "Not always. There\u2019s sometimes a display upfront with table numbers that\u2019s printed. So they would either have to rush last minute and get a new one or write over it. Honestly having a table to myself sounds good.", "Not especially close with my sister. My brother and I were very close.", "Finally some sanity in these comments. I understand it being an oversight but damn, you really made your sister sit at an awkwardly half empty table and look at her recently dead brother's empty chair.\n\nThere is always some kind of detectable logic to wedding seating assignments - the grooms college friends, the singletons, even \"the leftovers that are vaguely similar in age\". Putting literally anyone else at her table would have allowed your sister and her family a distraction in finding commonality with their table mates, and to at least pretend that they were actually meant to be the parents in their 30s table or whatever. Instead, leaving the table empty made it painfully clear that this was the \"bride's siblings\" table even though half of that category was tragically deceased.", "Agree with this OP NTA", "Just my family and no need to make awkward small talk?  Sis would have gotten a thank you card!", "I've never been to a wedding with a seating chart and it has never been a problem.", "I'm sorry but 3 days is plenty of time. 3 hours would have been enough time. 3 minutes might have been a bit of a rush, but doable.", "OP thought it was too hard to change arrangements because the seating cards were printed. Sitting cards. Pieces of paper. Being a bride does not excuse one from following the basic calculus that paper is not as important as a person.", "Well it was supposed to be occupied by his best friend... and it was unfortunate the best friend couldn't come... and unfortunate that that the other people at the table couldn't come either... but that's life.\n\nSure perhaps a couple from another tabled could've been moved to this one... but there are other things for the OP to worry about and as much as she wanted her brother to still be alive... it's not what's happened.", "It's also the seating chart that's printed, which is usually a full poster sized display. The name cards are flexible but the chart isn't.", "Are you for real?", "There's this cool technology called \"markers\" that I'm almost 100% their caterers have access to", "If saying her first priority is the shells is dismissive then so is saying that leaving her sister sitting next to an empty chair her brother would have occupied is \"worrying about the seating chart.\"\n\nShe might not have time to think about the seating chart but she should have given her sister's feelings at least a passing thought.\n\nSister is upset because she thinks OP was thoughtless. And...you really.csng argue with that.", "Wow. That\u2019s waaaay over the top. It was an honest slipup & it\u2019s enormous chaos & tasks in the days leading up to a wedding. You apologized, there\u2019s nothing more you can do. \n\nThere has to be some other issue going on with her because it\u2019s incomprehensible why something like that could become such a bizarre hill to die on for her. \n\nNTA.", "The sister felt isolated being the only one sitting with only her nuclear family at a bigger family gathering. That does kind of suck, since often you do not see these people a lot. So yeah being upset about this is kinda understandable.\n\nOn the other hand seating would probably slip me too if there are last minute cancelations because of death in family. Still it's a slip up.\n\nIt is shitty all around. So you apologize for it slipping your mind, mind you not for any fault going around but simply to acknowledge that feelings we're hurt. And yeah in a relatively minor situation the offended party should accept the apology.\n\nInstead OP dismissed the sister's feeling and the sister held a petty grudge for the most part of a year.\n\nObviously yes holding a grudge about this for so long ist sister making this about herself. \n\nI remember being constantly seated at the kids table at 23, like I always was, which meant I was isolated from most other adults at family gatherings. It upset me so I told them how I felt and my family apologized for forgetting my age and proceeded to upgrade me to adult seating. I was happy to be able to talk with adults at food time but offered to take over baby sitting between meals. There is nothing wrong with communicating stuff like that.", "Why is it on OP to manage their sister's emotions on OP's wedding day? And it was OP's brother also. OP was also grieving. The sister is still upset 9 months later.", "Because OP was the one who sat the sister at that table."]}
