I\u2019m completely stumped on who TA is here now.  This isn\u2019t a situation that I ever thought I would be in.\n\nI (41M) have a 15yo daughter Kat with my soon to be ex (42F).  The split has been decided on for 6 months now and we\u2019re trying to keep it as amicable as possible. I don\u2019t want to go into the reasons for the split, it\u2019s beside the point. My ex will be the one moving out of the house since the house was mine before we married and we had a prenup, but I\u2019m helping her get things squared away to buy her own place so we\u2019ll be living together for awhile longer.  Separate bedrooms.  We tried to make the news as easy on Kat as possible and break it over a few conversations across a month so it didn\u2019t feel so sudden and she would have time to process things in pieces. She was upset, but she seemed to be doing ok. She\u2019s a good kid and I made it clear to her that my #1 priority is her and making sure both of us get through this and have a good life.\n\nI still don\u2019t have a clear picture of what happened, but I came home from work one day to find Kat locked in her room and my ex fuming. She said they had an argument about the divorce and Kat was disrespectful. They\u2019ve been having the usual teen daughter/mom problems for awhile, so I thought it was something similar.  Kat wouldn\u2019t talk to me, but she did unlock the door so I could make sure she was ok and I gave my ex some money to go get dinner for herself so Kat would come down and eat.  Since the fight she hasn\u2019t talked to anyone. Not even to her friends. Her teacher says that she\u2019ll participate in class, but she doesn\u2019t talk beyond that. I had already started her in therapy, but she won\u2019t talk to the therapist anymore. The most I\u2019ve gotten out of her is a nod when I asked if she would let me know if she needed help or if she felt like hurting herself even if it was just a text or a note.\n\nMy ex is losing her shit about it and insisted that we take her electronics away. I resisted but we\u2019re more than a month into this now and I\u2019m coming up with nothing, so we took her phone and put her on supervised computer time for a week.  I told her that I wanted her to have some uninterrupted time to think so she could let me know what she needed. Nothing. Didn\u2019t phase her at all. Anytime my ex is in the house she won\u2019t leave her room. She does her usual routine but she just seems to mentally check out otherwise. \n\nMy ex wants to ramp up the pressure and take other things away and this is where I might be TA. I told her that I won\u2019t punish Kat for this anymore, I\u2019m giving her her phone back, and if she cares about her daughter she needs to mom up and go make whatever happened right. This isn\u2019t just willful kid stuff.  She called me an AH for implying she doesn\u2019t care about Kat and always taking her side and coddling her.

Based on Kat's reaction, it may have been something horrible.\n\nKat isn't doing anything wrong by not talking, either, so punishing her for it makes no sense.", "NTA. A week without a phone is ages for a teenager. It's time to end that punishment and definitely give her back tools that help with communication. But can you try an incentive instead? Do some activity she likes if she agrees to talk with you?\n\nEDIT: I know others are asking this too, and I want to second it. Can your ex stay elsewhere now? Can you ask your daughter if she would be more comfortable at home if her mother were not staying there still, then act accordingly?", "Are you an AH for thinking you should stop punishing your daughter more because previous punishments are ineffective at placating your ex? No. I would say you\u2019re NTA. I have a niece who was the girl in this story. My brother tried to force her to talk and she only clammed up more. He sent her to therapy but got angry when \u201cthey didn\u2019t fix her\u201d. All she wanted was to be left alone. \n\nYour daughter must be mad at her mother for a reason. But shouldn\u2019t it be her right to reveal her feelings when she\u2019s ready? To whomever she chooses?\n\nI would just take your daughter\u2019s side and play nice until the ex is gone. Good luck! Hug your kid and tell her you love her. If nothing else you\u2019ll be her \u201cgood guy\u201d.", "NTA\n\nYou can't punish a traumatized teen into being happy. If you take away her phone and internet, you will drive her more deeply into depression and shut-down. \n\nYour kid is deeply deeply upset and sad and she doesn't trust you or your wife. That is very bad. And punishing will make it worse.", "NTA\n\nSomething deep happened between mom and daughter, and only they know what.\n\n>she needs to mom up and go make whatever happened right\n\nThis is the correct path to start the healing process between them. Punishment will not help and will only make things worse.", "NTA.\n\nIf your daughter is willing to nod 'yes' or 'no' to questions, ask her if she needs to go somewhere else while she works through things. Could be the grandparents, a friends house, you and her go somewhere else, whatever.\n\nAlternatively, your ex moves up that timeline for getting out of the house and leaves *now.*\n\nBut I think this is well beyond 'kid throwing a tantrum' and into 'kid is having a trauma response' territory. You gotta step up as Dad and get her somewhere she feels safe. Whatever your ex said to her, it was *bad.*", "Wow. NTA. What ever upset your daughter REALLY upset her. And punishing her for her silence is not only cruel but clearly counter productive. She is one tough cookie and has the willpower to stay the course. Your wife trying to turn it into a test of wills cannot end well for anyone concerned. And your wife is huge TA for not being honest about what happened between them so that perhaps the two of you can begin to get your daughter whatever help she needs. Stick to your guns and take care of your kid.  This is clearly something deeper than teenage spite. I wish you and your daughter the best of luck working this out.", "NTA\n\nSomething major happened during that fight and you shouldn't be punishing your daughter for it at all. Your ex is way past out of line. \n\nThere are two scenarios I can think of:\n\nA) Something your ex said threw your daughter into a depressive tailspin. The fact that she's basically interacting with nobody unless it's necessary is a really bad sign. \n\nB) Your ex threatened or abused your daughter in some manner and this is how your daughter is choosing to protect herself. \n\nVery, very occasionally people will just go mute as a coping mechanism. (James Earl Jones spent years mute because his stutter distressed him so much.) Don't punish her for it. She'll let it go once she's ready and feels safe. If she's choosing not to speak right now it's likely because she feels it's the safest solution to whatever the problem is. I'll warn you now: it could literally take years for her to decide to talk again. You're going to have to learn to pay attention to her body language and actions.\n\nThe fact that your daughter refuses to talk to the therapist makes me worry that your ex might have interrogated the therapist at some point and used any information she got from that conversation during the fight. I don't know that that's what happened, but if your daughter thinks it did? That's definitely one of the worst case scenarios. \n\nIf that happened, not talking to the therapist would make sense because she doesn't trust them anymore. She also might no longer know who to trust at all depending on what your ex said. The first thing I would ask her is if she feels she can't trust her therapist. She doesn't have to answer verbally. A nod or a shake is enough, but you need an answer on this one. \n\nIf the answer is no? Objective number one is to get a therapist your daughter feels she can trust. This might require a group session with all of you in the room and the therapist explaining the professional rules that they're under and what kind of steps she can take if she feels the therapist has broken confidentiality. This should include assurances that the only information you'll tell anyone but her is that \"yes, she attended the sessions. I'm billing you for.\" This can go as far as not telling anyone over the phone but your daughter what time her next appointment is if verification is needed. If you have to go so far as to set up a bank account so the daughter can personally write the check to the therapist so that the therapist cannot talk to you at all? You do that. I think it's unlikely you'll have to go to that extreme, but be prepared to offer it if your daughter's trust is that far gone.\n\nThen you explain the current situation to the therapist and ask for reasonable suggestions for how to make sure your daughter still feels safe, supported and loved while she refrains from talking.\n\nGive your daughter back any privileges that were removed. Tell her that anything she says to you won't get back to her mother. Tell her she doesn't have to talk until she's ready. Ask her if she even wants her mother to stay or if she feels safe around her. Reassure her that it's ok if she doesn't answer either way. \n\nThen tell her it's your job to protect her and explain what steps you plan to take next in regards to her mother and why you plan to take them. It would probably be best to discuss these points with the therapist first, ideally alone, but if your daughter is having trust issues you might need to include her. \n\nTo be completely blunt, if I were in your situation right now, I'd have already asked my ex to leave the house and I'd be seriously considering pushing for full custody unless my kid indicated otherwise.\n\nI'd be doing everything I could to make sure my kid was feeling safe and comfortable. She also needs to know that if any decisions you make upset her then she's allowed to object without penalties. \n\nYou're potentially dealing with an extremely big emotional mess here with your kid. She needs reassurance, acceptance, love and stability.", "Info: What did your wife say to your daughter during that argument? Do you know?", "I mean, besides not talking, whats the issue? She's still going to school and stuff right?\n\nThey're also at the age in which they can freely choose between which parents they live with.\n\nI am actually curious if you know she completely shuts down when your ex is around, why do you continue to let them be around?\n\nI wouldn't let them in the house anymore unless there was a good reason for it.

Kat and your STBX both know what it is. \n\nNTA regarding not punishing her more. She's not actually doing anything *bad*. This isn't just silent treatment. I'm more inclined to look at her mom in this. A normal row doesn't result in this.", "NTA. Any chance your wife read your daughter's therapy journal and didn't like what it said? That would explain a lot.", "NTA. Your daughter needs help, not punishment.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s clear she\u2019s going through something and to punish her for that would only push her away more especially since she will ascertain that this is coming from your ex. Poor thing. You\u2019re doing great. Keep doing what your doing\u2026because she is responding to you, even if it\u2019s small. Continue to nourish a safe space. It does make me wonder what they fought about. I wonder if once she moves out, if that will give your daughter the space to feel safe because she does not feel emotionally safe.", "You need to boot your ex out of the house.  She did something to traumatize your child and her presence (and insistence on punishment) continues that abuse. Stop looking for a smoking gun and look at the facts:\n\nYour child was alone with your wife.  Your child is now selectively mute.  Your wife is acting erratic.  Your daughter no longer feels safe even communicating in writing.   Your wife continues to harass your daughter.  \n\nAt best, this child is depressed.  At worst, she was threatened with something awful.  Realistically, she\u2019s locked in by anxiety.", "NTA. Something is seriously wrong here. But, I\u2019m betting this situation will greatly improve as soon as your ex leaves. Could she move back in with her parents?", "I think your ex needs to leave immediately.  Kat is clearly anxious and feels unsafe.", "My guy this is so above Reddit.\n\nBut dude if she's normally chatty and bubbly and then suddenly this after a fight CLEARLY something happened and from your responses to others it sounds like you need to make it snappy and get your ex Outta the house. \n\nAlso I know your daughter isn't talking to you but let her know that she can take all the time she needs and that you know something awful happened, you don't know what, but when she is ready you'll be there and you'll believe her and back her up 100% because it must have been something real bad to make her not talk to anyone and that you love her so much. \n\nJust continue to act as a wall between your ex and your daughter. The ex clearly isn't taking divorce well and is also acting out and specifically acting out twords your daughter. There might have always been a rift and abuse or issues between them and this is just the peak of the fracture. \n\nProtect your daughter.", "I didn\u2019t talk to my father for five years after my parents announced they were getting divorced.

You may feel generous about splitting custody with your STBX right now but considering she left kiddo so traumatized she won't speak, and then insisted on doubling down by punishing her for being traumatized.

It took decades. I finally told my adult kids a little, but they didn\u2019t believe me. Basically, the divorce was really hard on all of us, and we tried to be understanding with each other. It was freaking hard and still is sometimes. I highly recommend therapy for any child going through a divorce, and keep trying different ones until the kid finds one they can talk to.", "NTA you're making a mistake. Stop punishing her.

The one time my dad tried to step up and help when my mother flipped out, she threatened to leave and my dad and I backed down. I never forgot and I blamed myself for putting my dad in that situation. As an adult, I realized that I was a kid and it was my mom who was in the wrong and my dad should have stood up for me. You sound like a good dad and I hope I stand by my kids as well as you are by your daughter right now.

I hope he will do the same when I struggle. You are doing the right thing making it clear that the adult is the responsible party for emotional regulation and not for punishing kids for their emotions. I do it now because my past abuse has left me with decades of trauma responses and I don\u2019t want my husband to misunderstand or expect something else. I will also clearly tell my children why I side with them and what I expect from them.

For both of them. Your ex with the erratic and aggressive/controlling behavior and your daughter with any mental health struggles/feeling powerless. =(", "Well, that or abuse.", "This.  When I was divorcing and my daughter didn\u2019t want to talk, we\u2019d go get a portion of chips from the chippy and a hot chocolate and drive up into the hills. Park up in a lay-by with a great view and just hang. Not talking.  Gradually over time she\u2019d talk when she wanted to.  \n\nIt took months.  MONTHS.\n\nI was just glad she wanted to spend the time with me.  Even now, at 18, she does her best most open talking when we go for long drives or if she says can we get chips and drive up the tops, then I know she\u2019s got something on her mind she wants to talk about.", "This isn\u2019t directed to you, but towards OP. I want to add, and I know it doesn\u2019t need to be said, but also tell her you love her and that you\u2019re there for her. Just the reminder can be good.", "Or did something traumatic.", "Animal-assisted therapy could also be really helpful. Dogs, horses, and many other animals are used, because they\u2019re completely nonjudgmental and safe (as long as there are no allergies or phobias involved), and she wouldn\u2019t have to speak to communicate with them.", "I has selective mutism ^w^", "I think mom read the therapy journal and whatever was in there was \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d", "I\u2019m afraid my mind went there to. I may have spent to much time on this site lately", "Yeah, I am very worried about this.  It sounds like the ex has said some very awful things. I would like to know what happened.", "Both super good ideas. Potentially also give her a notebook to write in but only if he can be sure his STBX won't take it and read it. Like maybe a notebook and a lockbox that only she can access. But the drives and reading to her don't pressure her to communicate at all so they're important as well.", "This is it.  The mom caused this and she knows very well how bad what she said was - that's why she hasn't shared it in all this time. What a disaster of a parent--and we know who she got it from, given the inlaws' behavior. Anyway, maybe OP can blackmail the mom into fessing up (e.g. threaten to kick her out if she doesn't).  It's not pretty but OP needs to take the daughter's side and get to the bottom of this, and asking the daughter to talk first a. may not work, the way things are going, and b. puts her in a conflictual position, given the mom probably demanded her silence.  Though it may still be better than the status quo.", "Maybe not- my psycho mom used to just liento me and tell me her and my therapist were talking about me behind my back, or she would demand to know what I said in therapy and if I didn't tell her she would say she was just going to call and find out. Even thought a therapist will tell you that you have privacy with them.... an abusive narcissist can still convince you that you can't trust anyone. *ANYONE*. Not anyone at home and not any other adult. \n\nSomeone who's good at abusing you will make good God damn sure that you're scared, all the time. That you're too scared to talk, and then use it against you (as we see in the scenario). Get the kid a NEW therapist, who she knows does not have contact with the ex. Maybe then she can slowly start getting her voice when she's ready", "Agreed, it's actually super common for selective mutism to manifest only in some situations. Often a kid will speak with some family members but only them. It's less common for someone to participate verbally in class but not speak at home and I think a sign of concern for sure.\n\nAnd the reason they changed it to selective rather than elective is because of that bit about it *not* being the silent treatment. Selective doesn't mean they're consciously selecting when to talk, rather that they're only able to in selected situations. When they try to speak in the unsafe-feeling situation they may well be *physically unable* to. If not that bad then it can be more like forcing themselves to talk is sort of like forcing yourself to seriously physically harm yourself - a part of your brain will try to stop you doing it because it recognises it as harmful behaviour and it's incredibly difficult to overcome that.", "Yeah having seen the comments about the journal makes me think that's possible too.", "The whole definition of selective mutism is that it usually only applies in *select situations* rather than consistently. If she wasn't speaking at all it would just be mutism with a psychological cause.", "You need to get her mother out of the house now. Depending on Kat\u2019s age she may be able to choose whether to see her or not. Some states it\u2019s 14.", "I'm so sorry about your friend. I choose to believe that they'd feel some comfort knowing that their experience taught you a valuable lesson in parenthood before you even knew you'd need it.", "Absolutely.  \n\nShe needs time and space without pressure.  She needs understanding and unconditional love until she feels safe enough to start talking again. Not sending away to somewhere unfamiliar and potentially harmful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine if you don\u2019t feel like talking.  Whenever you are ready, I\u2019ll listen.  Even if it\u2019s just I think I\u2019d like a cup of tea.  I\u2019m here for whatever you need and to support you any way I can.  I get that this is an awful time for you. I love you\u201d.\n\nAnd then back off absolutely.  Treat life as normal. No punishments, no pressure, no kid gloves. Just normal.  \n\nIf her mother doesn\u2019t agree and wants to punish then you have to make a decision as to whether spending time with her mother is good for your daughter\u2019s mental health at this point (and find some way or understanding and incorporating your daughters wishes into that decision).\n\nI really do wish you the best of luck. My daughter (now 18) also struggled with our divorce but it does pass. Things do get better as long as you support and understand kids rather than pressurise and punish them.", "Can\u2019t you get her therapist to testify? Like out in a good word for you?", "I agree, something awful has occurred verbally or physically the OP needs to get to the truth. \nThe way your ex wants to punish almost seems like she knows she screwed up. \nIs there any chance your ex can move out now and then maybe your daughter can open up to you?", "Same here. But the problem is that STBX won't ever say what happened and daughter refuses to talk, and getting daughter to open up when she refuses to even talk to her therapist in confidence? That's going to be one hell of a tough but to crack.", "This. It was more than just a typical argument.", "it seems like shes not going to talk in such a situation, if shes not even talking at school beyond the bare minimum, or to her therapist. shes too traumatized to even speak. maybe shed be willing to write it in a letter to op??", "Probably because thr mom breathes down her neck about schoolwork. If she were to fall behind in class she would definitely lose her remaining privileges, think about it.", "Yes, I agree. Can you get her into therapy and the mother away from the house? I would block contacts from the mother's side of the family until it's resolved. Something dire was said or done at the last argument. \ud83e\udd14 \n\nPoor kiddo, punishing her is not the way. I would be tempted to say put some cameras up to protect your kid until Mama moves out.", "Yeah, physical abuse was unfortunately my first concern.\n\nPerhaps a threat regarding custody, once OP and ex are no longer living together and OP won't be able to protect her as much?", "She does participate in class, so maybe there's some hope to cling to that a conversation on their own might work?", "Yes lets hope the mom only insulted a child not only just a child but her own daughter because that is not that bad", "The thing is that blocking mom or mom's family could easily be taken as proof of attempted alienation in court which will then harm both OP and daughter. As would just tossing STBX out of the house. Yes it would likely be best for daughter but the courts can be extremely rigid and STBX doesn't sound like someone who is interested in what is best for daughter or she'd own up about wtf she said or did.", "OP should speak to his lawyer and possibly a judge about what is going on, even get the therapist involved. If a therapist said that she shouldn't be around her mother right now a judge would back that up.", "If she won\u2019t talk except to certain people, it\u2019s by definition selective mutism."]}
