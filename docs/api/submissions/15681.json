I\u2019m completely stumped on who TA is here now.  This isn\u2019t a situation that I ever thought I would be in.\n\nI (41M) have a 15yo daughter Kat with my soon to be ex (42F).  The split has been decided on for 6 months now and we\u2019re trying to keep it as amicable as possible. I don\u2019t want to go into the reasons for the split, it\u2019s beside the point. My ex will be the one moving out of the house since the house was mine before we married and we had a prenup, but I\u2019m helping her get things squared away to buy her own place so we\u2019ll be living together for awhile longer.  Separate bedrooms.  We tried to make the news as easy on Kat as possible and break it over a few conversations across a month so it didn\u2019t feel so sudden and she would have time to process things in pieces. She was upset, but she seemed to be doing ok. She\u2019s a good kid and I made it clear to her that my #1 priority is her and making sure both of us get through this and have a good life.\n\nI still don\u2019t have a clear picture of what happened, but I came home from work one day to find Kat locked in her room and my ex fuming. She said they had an argument about the divorce and Kat was disrespectful. They\u2019ve been having the usual teen daughter/mom problems for awhile, so I thought it was something similar.  Kat wouldn\u2019t talk to me, but she did unlock the door so I could make sure she was ok and I gave my ex some money to go get dinner for herself so Kat would come down and eat.  Since the fight she hasn\u2019t talked to anyone. Not even to her friends. Her teacher says that she\u2019ll participate in class, but she doesn\u2019t talk beyond that. I had already started her in therapy, but she won\u2019t talk to the therapist anymore. The most I\u2019ve gotten out of her is a nod when I asked if she would let me know if she needed help or if she felt like hurting herself even if it was just a text or a note.\n\nMy ex is losing her shit about it and insisted that we take her electronics away. I resisted but we\u2019re more than a month into this now and I\u2019m coming up with nothing, so we took her phone and put her on supervised computer time for a week.  I told her that I wanted her to have some uninterrupted time to think so she could let me know what she needed. Nothing. Didn\u2019t phase her at all. Anytime my ex is in the house she won\u2019t leave her room. She does her usual routine but she just seems to mentally check out otherwise. \n\nMy ex wants to ramp up the pressure and take other things away and this is where I might be TA. I told her that I won\u2019t punish Kat for this anymore, I\u2019m giving her her phone back, and if she cares about her daughter she needs to mom up and go make whatever happened right. This isn\u2019t just willful kid stuff.  She called me an AH for implying she doesn\u2019t care about Kat and always taking her side and coddling her.

Based on Kat's reaction, it may have been something horrible.\n\nKat isn't doing anything wrong by not talking, either, so punishing her for it makes no sense.", "NTA. A week without a phone is ages for a teenager. It's time to end that punishment and definitely give her back tools that help with communication. But can you try an incentive instead? Do some activity she likes if she agrees to talk with you?\n\nEDIT: I know others are asking this too, and I want to second it. Can your ex stay elsewhere now? Can you ask your daughter if she would be more comfortable at home if her mother were not staying there still, then act accordingly?", "Are you an AH for thinking you should stop punishing your daughter more because previous punishments are ineffective at placating your ex? No. I would say you\u2019re NTA. I have a niece who was the girl in this story. My brother tried to force her to talk and she only clammed up more. He sent her to therapy but got angry when \u201cthey didn\u2019t fix her\u201d. All she wanted was to be left alone. \n\nYour daughter must be mad at her mother for a reason. But shouldn\u2019t it be her right to reveal her feelings when she\u2019s ready? To whomever she chooses?\n\nI would just take your daughter\u2019s side and play nice until the ex is gone. Good luck! Hug your kid and tell her you love her. If nothing else you\u2019ll be her \u201cgood guy\u201d.", "NTA\n\nYou can't punish a traumatized teen into being happy. If you take away her phone and internet, you will drive her more deeply into depression and shut-down. \n\nYour kid is deeply deeply upset and sad and she doesn't trust you or your wife. That is very bad. And punishing will make it worse.", "NTA\n\nSomething deep happened between mom and daughter, and only they know what.\n\n>she needs to mom up and go make whatever happened right\n\nThis is the correct path to start the healing process between them. Punishment will not help and will only make things worse.", "NTA.\n\nIf your daughter is willing to nod 'yes' or 'no' to questions, ask her if she needs to go somewhere else while she works through things. Could be the grandparents, a friends house, you and her go somewhere else, whatever.\n\nAlternatively, your ex moves up that timeline for getting out of the house and leaves *now.*\n\nBut I think this is well beyond 'kid throwing a tantrum' and into 'kid is having a trauma response' territory. You gotta step up as Dad and get her somewhere she feels safe. Whatever your ex said to her, it was *bad.*", "Wow. NTA. What ever upset your daughter REALLY upset her. And punishing her for her silence is not only cruel but clearly counter productive. She is one tough cookie and has the willpower to stay the course. Your wife trying to turn it into a test of wills cannot end well for anyone concerned. And your wife is huge TA for not being honest about what happened between them so that perhaps the two of you can begin to get your daughter whatever help she needs. Stick to your guns and take care of your kid.  This is clearly something deeper than teenage spite. I wish you and your daughter the best of luck working this out.", "NTA\n\nSomething major happened during that fight and you shouldn't be punishing your daughter for it at all. Your ex is way past out of line. \n\nThere are two scenarios I can think of:\n\nA) Something your ex said threw your daughter into a depressive tailspin. The fact that she's basically interacting with nobody unless it's necessary is a really bad sign. \n\nB) Your ex threatened or abused your daughter in some manner and this is how your daughter is choosing to protect herself. \n\nVery, very occasionally people will just go mute as a coping mechanism. (James Earl Jones spent years mute because his stutter distressed him so much.) Don't punish her for it. She'll let it go once she's ready and feels safe. If she's choosing not to speak right now it's likely because she feels it's the safest solution to whatever the problem is. I'll warn you now: it could literally take years for her to decide to talk again. You're going to have to learn to pay attention to her body language and actions.\n\nThe fact that your daughter refuses to talk to the therapist makes me worry that your ex might have interrogated the therapist at some point and used any information she got from that conversation during the fight. I don't know that that's what happened, but if your daughter thinks it did? That's definitely one of the worst case scenarios. \n\nIf that happened, not talking to the therapist would make sense because she doesn't trust them anymore. She also might no longer know who to trust at all depending on what your ex said. The first thing I would ask her is if she feels she can't trust her therapist. She doesn't have to answer verbally. A nod or a shake is enough, but you need an answer on this one. \n\nIf the answer is no? Objective number one is to get a therapist your daughter feels she can trust. This might require a group session with all of you in the room and the therapist explaining the professional rules that they're under and what kind of steps she can take if she feels the therapist has broken confidentiality. This should include assurances that the only information you'll tell anyone but her is that \"yes, she attended the sessions. I'm billing you for.\" This can go as far as not telling anyone over the phone but your daughter what time her next appointment is if verification is needed. If you have to go so far as to set up a bank account so the daughter can personally write the check to the therapist so that the therapist cannot talk to you at all? You do that. I think it's unlikely you'll have to go to that extreme, but be prepared to offer it if your daughter's trust is that far gone.\n\nThen you explain the current situation to the therapist and ask for reasonable suggestions for how to make sure your daughter still feels safe, supported and loved while she refrains from talking.\n\nGive your daughter back any privileges that were removed. Tell her that anything she says to you won't get back to her mother. Tell her she doesn't have to talk until she's ready. Ask her if she even wants her mother to stay or if she feels safe around her. Reassure her that it's ok if she doesn't answer either way. \n\nThen tell her it's your job to protect her and explain what steps you plan to take next in regards to her mother and why you plan to take them. It would probably be best to discuss these points with the therapist first, ideally alone, but if your daughter is having trust issues you might need to include her. \n\nTo be completely blunt, if I were in your situation right now, I'd have already asked my ex to leave the house and I'd be seriously considering pushing for full custody unless my kid indicated otherwise.\n\nI'd be doing everything I could to make sure my kid was feeling safe and comfortable. She also needs to know that if any decisions you make upset her then she's allowed to object without penalties. \n\nYou're potentially dealing with an extremely big emotional mess here with your kid. She needs reassurance, acceptance, love and stability.", "Info: What did your wife say to your daughter during that argument? Do you know?", "I mean, besides not talking, whats the issue? She's still going to school and stuff right?\n\nThey're also at the age in which they can freely choose between which parents they live with.\n\nI am actually curious if you know she completely shuts down when your ex is around, why do you continue to let them be around?\n\nI wouldn't let them in the house anymore unless there was a good reason for it.

Kat and your STBX both know what it is. \n\nNTA regarding not punishing her more. She's not actually doing anything *bad*. This isn't just silent treatment. I'm more inclined to look at her mom in this. A normal row doesn't result in this.", "NTA. Any chance your wife read your daughter's therapy journal and didn't like what it said? That would explain a lot.", "NTA. Your daughter needs help, not punishment.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s clear she\u2019s going through something and to punish her for that would only push her away more especially since she will ascertain that this is coming from your ex. Poor thing. You\u2019re doing great. Keep doing what your doing\u2026because she is responding to you, even if it\u2019s small. Continue to nourish a safe space. It does make me wonder what they fought about. I wonder if once she moves out, if that will give your daughter the space to feel safe because she does not feel emotionally safe.", "You need to boot your ex out of the house.  She did something to traumatize your child and her presence (and insistence on punishment) continues that abuse. Stop looking for a smoking gun and look at the facts:\n\nYour child was alone with your wife.  Your child is now selectively mute.  Your wife is acting erratic.  Your daughter no longer feels safe even communicating in writing.   Your wife continues to harass your daughter.  \n\nAt best, this child is depressed.  At worst, she was threatened with something awful.  Realistically, she\u2019s locked in by anxiety.", "NTA. Something is seriously wrong here. But, I\u2019m betting this situation will greatly improve as soon as your ex leaves. Could she move back in with her parents?", "I think your ex needs to leave immediately.  Kat is clearly anxious and feels unsafe.", "My guy this is so above Reddit.\n\nBut dude if she's normally chatty and bubbly and then suddenly this after a fight CLEARLY something happened and from your responses to others it sounds like you need to make it snappy and get your ex Outta the house. \n\nAlso I know your daughter isn't talking to you but let her know that she can take all the time she needs and that you know something awful happened, you don't know what, but when she is ready you'll be there and you'll believe her and back her up 100% because it must have been something real bad to make her not talk to anyone and that you love her so much. \n\nJust continue to act as a wall between your ex and your daughter. The ex clearly isn't taking divorce well and is also acting out and specifically acting out twords your daughter. There might have always been a rift and abuse or issues between them and this is just the peak of the fracture. \n\nProtect your daughter.", "I didn\u2019t talk to my father for five years after my parents announced they were getting divorced.

With her gone your daughter might start to feel safe again and eventually start talking again.", "You need to get your wife out of there..NOW.  Until you do, I doubt anything is going to work with your daughter.  If she's literally hiding from her mother, I suspect that is motivated by fear.

Beyond class participation, I didn\u2019t speak a word to anyone for nearly 6 months. For me, I was deeply depressed and was silent as a means of self-preservation. I felt like there was no one I could trust and anything I said would be used against me to cause me more pain.\n\nDo you have any idea what your daughters fight with your ex was about? Given that was the event that triggered this behavior, I would suggest not letting your ex off the hook until they give you a crystal clear account of everything that happened. \n\nOther than that, your daughters therapist will have the best advice for you.

I'm so sorry for your daughter!", "Honestly, I think your ex needs to move out, like now! Kay has made it clear she doesn't feel safe around her mother. She won't get better until she feels safe. \n\nThen you need to initiate for full custody with supervised visits, and try and mandate ex attends therapy and/or some kind of parenting class (volunteer to go too if it would encourage ex to go).  You'll probably need to have full medical decision making (and  maybe for other stuff too).", "Yeah, and you genius people decided to let her more traumatized by punishing her for the way she chose to cope.\n\nThe therapist can say it's abuse cause your daughter won't talk but your ex wife behavior is unhinged and the fact that you were in it is also awful. This kid has feels like she has no one.", "Then get your ex out of the house! And change the locks when she goes.", "Have you asked your daughter if she'd prefer her mom (your stbx btw) move out now.

Don't punish her for being selectively mute and get a second opinion or a very clear explanation if the therapist recommends it. I'm glad you're going to start therapy too. \n\nMy brother didn't talk for several months when we moved, moving was the trauma. Our parents tried one therapist and gave up because he wouldn't talk. He suffered for years from that decision (and so did I). \n\nAsk your daughter about different art supplies and maybe a private place to create that no one will see the process or product. Personally, I find paint and boxing gloves quite therapeutic but it's a bit messy. Tell her if she sees something she wants to try just to let you know what she needs. \n\nWriting/painting and burning it can be quite therapeutic too. While it may sound unkind so her therapist's input could be useful, writing something to her mother and burning it along with some resemblance of her mother, like a photo or stick person while saying something like \"I'm letting go of my anger and releasing all the harm...\" can be really helpful symbolism. \n\nWhat does she like? Do you know if she wants to go on a trip? \n\nI'm glad she has someone standing up to her mother for her and trying to support and not punish her.", "I think she needs for your stbx to move out so she feels safe again", "Am a therapist and this is exactly right. The poor kid is terrified of something. Mom probably ought to be out of the house.", "I see your point. My interpretation was anger.

That\u2019s a tough situation.", "yeah. not diagnosing the kid here to be clear but I'm autistic and go mute sometimes when I'm really overwhelmed or on the edge of a meltdown. it's honestly not fun not being able to communicate like you normally do, a kid keeping this up for a *month* doesn't scream anger or brattishness to me but something deeper?", "You really need to get your ex out of your house. She so unstable. This is not a safe environment for your daughter.", "You definitely need to find out what was sad. A lot if nastiness was bandied about by one of my parents during their divorce that messed me up for a long time. I have a strong feeling her mother said something particularly heinous. NTA, btw.", "Maybe you can tell your daughter that no matter what she tells you happened, you'll believe her.  It could be that your ex said or did something so bad that your daughter was traumatized and also doesn't think that anyone would believe her, so she's feeling alone and self isolating further. It's just a guess, but it makes sense to me.", "OP regardless of whether she physically assaulted your daughter or not, your ex DID hurt her. She is not functioning socially (one of the most important factors of being a teenager and a person in general!!!) as a direct result of your ex's actions. What teenager have you ever known to take on a completely different behavior and keep it up longterm and have it NOT be due to something serious? \n\nTBH you should stop allowing your ex to have meaningful input on how you interact with your daughter right now because she's clearly in a delicate place, while your ex is showing herself to be vindictive. Besides, you're going to separate and eventually have your own lives and way of interacting with Kat. This can just be part of that, if you need to frame it that way. \n\nIf I was you I would check if Kat wants time away from your ex and see if the therapist recommends that. If both are okay with it, go on a trip/outing/long drive on a weekend or whatever with just you two...whatever you can do to connect with her in a way she wants and let her know she has someone in her corner when she is ready to talk about it is so important.

As someone who had snoopy parents/step parent I learned nothing is safe. Not my sketchbooks, phone, or even little notes to myself. I ended up going no contact with my father and his now ex-wife due to an incident of her looking through my phone because she thought I was texting my mom about her. We were literally talking about a Law and Order SVU episode. \n\nSomething seriously happened to this kid and I hope OP figures out what happened and kicks STBX out. The fact that she's not even speaking to friends is alarming. My friends were my safe space when home was not.", "Sounds like mom threatened her about or hit her for speaking.
