They have a very unconventional style of parenting IMO, as the don't believe in celebrating birthdays or birthday gifts. This was my SILs idea  and she believes that acknowledging/celebrating your kids birthday's makes them spoiled and makes them believe that they day is all about them.\n\nWeird, but hey her kid her rules I guess. This is kind of controversial in my family because we are big on celebrating holiday's and birthday's and love giving each other gifts, but we respect their wishes and don't celebrate or acknowledge my brother, SIL or sadly my niece's birthday. \n\nNow my niece and I are pretty close as I'm her favorite aunty and at first the whole birthday thing wasn't an issue, because my niece was still too young to understand. But now that she's 6 she understands the concept of a birthday and I guess is confused why she \"doesn't have one\". My SIL went as far as to talk to my niece's teacher, explain her style of parenting, and the teacher now doesn't acknowledge my niece's birthday because my SIL will have a fit and complain to the school board if she does. \n\nLast weekend was my fianc\u00e9's birthday, and on Sunday my family and his family gathered at our house to have a small birthday dinner for him and a cake. When it was time for the cake and to blow out the candles my niece asked my fianc\u00e9 if she can try? He said sure, if it's okay with your mom and dad. My SIL looked hesitant but said yes. So my niece helped my fianc\u00e9 blow out his candles and made a wish with him. As a joke my fianc\u00e9 asked her what she wished for and she said \"cake on my birthday\". \n\nNow her birthday happened to be this past Thursday. So yesterday (Sunday) we asked my brother and SIL if we can take my niece out for dinner? My SIL said yes. \n\nLong story short at the end of dinner we got our server to bring out a cupcake for my niece with a candle in it so she can blow out. No one sung happy birthday or anything like that (even though I think it's ridiculous). I then gave my niece a little gift bag with a heart shaped necklace inside, and told her it was a little treat for her.\n\nShe obviously LOVED it and her cupcake.\n\nWell fast forward SIL and brother caught wind of this from my niece and are super pissed of at my fianc\u00e9 and I. They said we aren't respecting their parenting style and that my niece it not allowed to be around us alone anymore.\n\n I told my SIL that my niece is going to suffer because of her weird thing she has against birthday's and gifts. I also explained to her that no one acknowledged the birthday at the dinner. They think I'm a huge AH, the rest of my family think SIL is weird but I shouldn't have done that.

You can't just do something incredibly socially unacceptable and/or cruel and call it a parenting style.  \"I put horseradish on all of my kids food because that's my parenting style.\"\n\nThe 6 YO is already seeing that other people get birthdays and even wished for a cake on her birthdays.  that poor child.\n\nGive her presents \"Just because\" throughout the year.  \"I saw this and thought of you.\"  Be that generous person in her life.", "NTA. You showed her that her dreams can be shared and can come true.  You showed her you love her and that she is special.  Your niece sees others celebrating their birthdays.  The teachers at school will now celebrate everyone but her.  Your SIL is misguided and planting some serious self esteem issues.  Birthdays don't have to be getting \"spoils\".  Birthdays are about caring for yourself in the midst of a world and a million things that will never put you first.  It's about celebrating you being in this world and others saying that we are happy that you are in our world.  Her Mom is teaching her that she is sad that she is in this world, and not worth celebrating.  The road to hell is paved with good intentions.  Her Mom is really effing this one up.  It's very sad to hear.", "> the don't believe in celebrating birthdays or birthday gifts\n\nI'd say that, in a society that **absolutely does** celebrate birthdays etc., this is just basic cruelty. Honestly they are inadequate parents. NTA", "NTA and what a self centered and frankly miserly attitude. It sounds entirely like a cop-out excuse to be cheap and not celebrate their kid's own birthday.\n\nShe's 6, so as soon as she's in school, that's going to make her a social pariah to her classmates. They are setting her up to be bullied and mistreated, and frankly abusing her self esteem.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. They are absolutely terrible parents.", "I'm a bit torn on this one because I don't blame you: SIL and bro's 'parenting style' seems exceedingly cruel and unusual.\n\n\"she believes that acknowledging/celebrating your kids birthday's makes them spoiled and makes them believe that they day is all about them.\" It...it is though. It's a child's birthday. It should be all about them one time a year. At least have the decency to get them a cake or something.\n\nThat being said, it is their kid and you went directly against their wishes.\n\nI'm going NTA but I'd suggest either having a private party for the kid or waiting until they visit you or another relative to receive their proper birthday.", "NTA. What a needlessly cruel parenting style. This child will grow up thinking there\u2019s something wrong with her when all of her friends (if she\u2019s allowed to have friends. Wouldn\u2019t want her to be spoiled) are celebrating their birthdays with family who loves them. Keep doing small things like this as often as you can without raising suspicion. Make sure your niece knows there is somebody in her corner. You sound like a good aunt.", "Others may disagree but I say NTA. Not celebrating birthdays is imo weird, especially when your niece is still a young child. I completely respect not wanting their daughter to be spoiled but they can celebrate her birthday without spoiling her. Your celebration with your niece is the perfect example of how to celebrate her without spoiling her. Being alive is a big deal and each time we make it another year we should acknowledge it and celebrate. Thank you for giving your niece a birthday celebration! She will remember your kindness and thoughtfulness.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds cruel. I have a friend who was raised in a religion with no birthdays/Christmas. He absolutely hated it and vowed never to do that to his kid.", "I get it, their kid, their parenting style. But this is going to create mental issues. This child is going to grow up resenting her parents, or lack of confidence or feel unloved. This is a birthday, not the celebration of a religious holiday.", "You did not make this a birthday event. You gave a child a cupcake with a candle on it to blow out.\n\nYour sister in law (facilitated by your brother) wants to suck all of the joy out of this child's life. What a shame.  NTA.", "I absolutely hate to put any sort of judgement on this post. I have 3 kids and I find this so very upsetting for your niece -- how can she understand the birthday thing if only her immediate family celebrates that way? Even though I think they are making a HUGE mistake and sending the message that she doesn't matter and doesn't deserve attention/a special moment, I would apologize asap so you aren't cut off. Eventually, you can be the fun auntie who can do fun things and buy her treats without attaching them to a particular day. You can get her a toy just because you want to, or go out for ice cream to celebrate the first day of summer or whatever. You can't go against the parents' wishes, even if they're horrible. NTA because you have your heart in the right place, but you need to backpedal and not attach celebrations to birthdays/holidays so they feel you follow their bizarre rules. The worst scenario would be having you cut off from her, and that little girl needs her auntie!!", "NTA. They don\u2019t have to \u201cbelieve\u201d in birthdays, but you don\u2019t have to not believe in them either. She\u2019s a freaking kid for crying out loud. I thought about this for a while some years ago. I was like \u201cyou\u2019re just getting gifts for no reason, you didn\u2019t do anything to earn them\u201d. And yes, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s good to teach a kid they\u2019re valuable, without them having to do anything to earn it.", "I'm going to say NTA.\n\nI do think that parent's are entitled to be pissed if others in their lives don't respect their wishes for how they want to raise their kid, but based on what you're saying, you didn't frame any of this as a birthday present or birthday dinner, you just gave her the experience without harping on calling it what it is. I think it's sort of bending the rules without really breaking them.\n\nI personally think it's a ridiculous notion not to let their kid at least have a cupcake on their birthday, but it's not exactly abusive (someone in the comments is going to disagree with me on that). I think they're brewing a recipe for their kid to grow up to resent them, and it sounds like they're strict helicopter parents, but they're allowed to set the rules even when they're dumb. However, they should know that as they're depriving their child of something incredibly common, she's going to ask about it and feel like she's missing out - because she is. It's not a common parenting move and people are always going to feel bad for their kid and want to make it up to her.", "Your SIL seems cheap af thats why she doesnt wanna feel obligated to give something to her kids on their birthdays", "NTA. They can make whatever parenting decisions they want, but at some point those decisions must clash with the real world. In our society we celebrate birthdays. There's no way this child can grow up without anyone acknowledging her birthday.", "They are segregating their child from everyone she is ever going to meet. Whilst I could understand if they didn't want to go OTT or have big extravagant parties, not acknowledging her birthday at all? That just feels down right cruel to me. And just putting it out their - peoples birthdays ARE all about them. It doesn't have to mean spending loads of money though.  \n\n\nNTA - bravo for making your niece feel special", "NTA\n\nNormally you don't override a parent's choice of parenting style but this is definitely an exception. Your niece clearly loves celebrating occasions and receiving gifts. You did the right thing, your SIL should respect her daughter's wishes over stubbornly sticking to her own worldview.", "NTA, and I didn't expect to have that opinion. You walked an amazingly fine line, but since you didn't mention the birthday, you didn't really celebrate the birthday. You simply treated your niece because you love her and are proud of her.\n\nI don't agree with the parenting style, but overall it's their choice and they are probably ruining their future relationship with their daughter. I would say you respected that choice, but just barely. \n\nAnytime you see the parents or the niece, I'd have a cake with candles, just to celebrate.", "[deleted]", "ESH? \nYour sister-in-law has clearly communicated her wishes and boundaries for her children, and you blatantly ignored and disregarded their family rules. If my siblings did this with my little one, I would have a hard time trusting them again, and letting them have alone time with my child\u2026 So don\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s your sister-in-law\u2019s next move.\n\nYour sister-in-law sounds like sucks also. I struggle to understand the no birthday celebration rule\u2026 unless it\u2019s a religious thing. I understand how your niece feels like she\u2019s different or left out, but that\u2019s some thing that your brother and sister-in-law will have to deal with in the future as her parents. Maybe they\u2019ll change their mind as she gets older, maybe not. But that\u2019s not your choice to make now. \n\nMaybe in the future instead of physical gifts like the necklace, you can just take your niece out for neat experiences around her birthday date (concert, water park, etc). That way your \u201cauntie heart\u201d can feel full knowing that you are somewhat spoiling your niece, but it\u2019s not necessarily a birthday gift", "ESH - First, let me just say that you are not an asshole, and I probably would have done the same thing. This girl's parents sound exhausting and they're delusional if they think they'll be able to enforce this much longer. As she gets older, friends will want to celebrate her birthday and get her gifts, and there'll be nothing they can do about it. That being said, they are still her parents, and as asinine as this decision is, it's still theirs to make. You said they're acting like you don't respect their parenting style, but it seems to me that you actually don't. You said that you think it's ridiculous. And again, to be clear, I'm with you all the way. But these do seem like the sort of people you should have expected this reaction from. You said her teacher knows not to even acknowledge her birthday because the parents will flip out. So you had to have seen this coming on some level. I think the whole thing would have been different if she were older, but she's still at an age where most parents expect to have a pretty significant say in how their child is raised.", "This has to be one of the most cruel things I have seen on Reddit. The parents are massive AH. That poor child, thank god OP is there for her niece. NTA", "I had a friend who was raised Jehovah\u2019s Witness and didn\u2019t celebrate birthdays or holiday. He left the religion, and unbeknownst to me at the time, I gave him his first birthday gift. He was 24. He wept. The best money I have ever spent. That little girl will never forget how special you made her feel. NTA.", "info: Why would you not ask about giving her a gift and a cupcake beforehand?", "NTA and you wouldn't be even if you ignore this dumb idea.", "NTA - I really don't see how your brother and SIL think that this is sustainable when they send their child out to school in the world everyday and she is going to see that kids are celebrated on their birthdays all the time. They are not going to raise a person that is not self-centered, they are going to raise a person that thinks that she is not worthy because not only don't her parents want to celebrate her birth, they want to forbid everyone else to do it. How is that sound parenting? Yes, you went against their wishes, but it was justified. You didn't do it on her birthday, so it doesn't count. Keep being a kick ass auntie!!!", "Awww, I completely understand why it would be difficult not to do that. That precious little baby! I can\u2019t call you an AH, for being a loving aunt and still trying to be respectful to some degree of her parents wishes.\n\nThat said, mainly to other comments not you, Jehovahs Witnesses don\u2019t celebrate bdays or holidays, and ppl tend to just accept it and move on. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll make her a social pariah or be bullied, like some are saying. There are cultures that don\u2019t do bdays and it is what it is. I\u2019m assuming this isn\u2019t religious and yes it\u2019s unusual.

Sil and Bro are tho, if they dont wanna celebrate their birthdays thats okay, but for a little kid? Thats cruel", "YTA, you should have respected your brother and SIL's wishes.

I don't agree with their parenting choice but instead of convincing them you went behind their backs and did it anyway.

There's a lot of excess in modern society, but it's just going to get worse for the kid in elementary school where classroom parties are a thing.
