Immediately after moving in together, I noticed that my boyfriend has a habit of sitting/laying on our bed after he gets home from work, and before he changes clothes or showers. This seriously repulses me. We both take public transport everywhere and I can't stand the thought of him sitting on a dirty, germ infested train, and then coming home and laying in our bed with those same clothes on.\n\nI pointed this out to him the first time I saw him do it, and he didn't really see what the big deal was but he said he'd try to be mindful of it. \n\nLast night he came home from work, and what do you know, decides to lay down in our bed with his filthy outside clothes on. I had literally JUST washed all of our bedding, and was extremely upset that now I'd have to do it all over again. I confronted him about it, and he told me that he had a long and hard day at work and just felt like he needed to decompress for a bit. I asked him why he couldn't do that on the couch then, or even just shower and change his clothes first. \n\nHe told me I was being an asshole and that I didn't seem to care about how he was feeling. I reminded him that we'd already talked about this, and that he *knows* I don't like it. I understand that outside clothes on the bed don't bother him in the same way it does me...but this is seriously one small ask and I feel like he should be willing to compromise, especially because he knows it drives me insane. And frankly, it's just gross. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679080263, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11u0mhw/aita_for_scolding_my_boyfriend_when_he_got/", "score": 411, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is not a lot to ask. Just like taking your shoes of in the home. \n\nAnd I don't have OCD. Does he otherwise respect you?", "NAH. You made a reasonable ask that he agreed to, but it also takes time for someone to truly unlearn a habit they've had their entire lives up to this point.\n\nBe patient. Perhaps a compromise could be made too where \\*he\\* washes the sheets himself again whenever he forgets, or have an extra sheet placed over your bed that you two can remove right before bed.", "NAH\n\nDifferent cultural or family styles.\n\nHow about a day cover for the bed? We have a cat that likes to sleep on the bed during the day. We have a cover we place over the bed after we get up in the morning, then roll it up and place it at the foot of the bed (or on the floor) overnight.

If he\u2019s laying \u201cin the bed\u201d, my mind says he\u2019s between the sheets, which is just oh my gosh, gross and disgusting. \u201cOn the bed\u201d sounds more like plopping down on a made up bed on top of the comforter. If it\u2019s the latter, how about just covering the bed with a sheet that you can then take off and wash, no harm done to the bed. Theoretically, should make you both happy.", "I don\u2019t think the boundary you\u2019re setting is too much. Laying down on top of a bed with \u201coutisde\u201d clothes on isn\u2019t really that nasty, especially if you have a duvet or other type of blanket on top.

I get mad at my husband for wearing his \"day clothes\" in our bed. It grosses me out, too.", "Soft NTA only because some cultures actually define outside and inside clothes. I was raised to not wear outside clothes to bed for hygiene, so I don't think it's ocd related. Subway/train transit has a funky smell, so I'm with you on this one, however, your BF may not have been raised the same way. Is there any way you can compromise? Like get a throw for the bed, similar to how hotels have covers.", "NTA, and I can't believe this is so insane and terrible to everyone in the comments. I do recommend seeing a therapist because it could certainly branch into more than just sheets, but that alone seems perfectly reasonable to me, public transport is dirty and to people who shower every day, this isn't such a big ask. anyway, I don't think you're the nightmare girlfriend people are making you out to be.", "NTA. I don't understand the 'OCD' commentary - I'm by no means a clean freak but one thing I will not compromise is any outside clothing on our bed.  I agree that the clothes you wear to go outside the house, especially getting on public transit, is FILTHY. You just can't see it.  I don't mind it if it's a bed that I just sleep in with PJs on.  When I was single I didn't care because I'm usually wearing underwear or whatever.  As long as my pillowcase is reasonably clean that was good enough. But a bed I share with a partner is different.  We get naked and have sex.  I want to keep it as clean as possible.  Unless you have sides divided and only have sex in one spot always under the covers, which doesn't sound fun at all.  It doesn't matter whether he's just laying on his side, or even on the bedspread.  If my naked body is going to get on it I want it clean.", "NTA. I don't have OCD, but I agree with this. Shoes off at the door and no street clothes on the bed. I would have him wash his face and hands before kissing and grabbing on me also. I would do the same when I got home.\n\nI am ok with the living room furniture if the clothing is not from construction work, a lab, or something like this. If so, I would lay something down.", "I\u2019m not a germaphobe. I find even sitting on the bed in outside clothes disgusting, let alone lying IN the bed. NTA.", "NAH - both of you are reasonable here. The best solution is to get a blanket/throw which he can quickly lay down over the bed so he can relax without undressing. Get one with two different sides to it so he can easily make sure he puts it \u2018street side up\u2019.", "NAH, you should put a sheet or cheap comforter on top, he should be allowed to lay on the bed, then take it off at bed And I get you might already have a comforter, put one on top of it", "I think I'm gonna go with NAH even though I'm on your side here lol. If this isn't something you guys can compromise on, there's gonna be a problem and neither of you will be happy. I personally don't think it's that big of a deal and your BF is being a baby about it, but some people were just raised differently and don't see a problem with getting in bed dirty. \n\nWhen I met my husband, he was someone that would even wear his shoes on the bed. It was how he was raised and was normal for him. I found it absolutely repulsive. We worked on it through the years and now he can't believe he ever did such a thing. Now, the being dirty/wearing dirty clothes thing; I managed to convince him to switch from morning to night showers and not get into bed randomly throughout the day. He complied but did find it annoying. But once we got cats, I think he finally realized how much crap he tracks onto the bed. I'm allergic to cats and he likes cuddling with them. If he doesn't clean himself before getting into bed, I have terrible sleep and am absolutely miserable by morning.", "Soft YTA. This is complicated, you two have just moved in together. Getting used to living together is HARD, it is not an easy process. Both people have to compromise things that they used to do to please the other. \n\nNot allowing \"outside clothes\" on bedding is, well, extreme. That's a big shift for him to get used to when moving in with you. It definitely sounds like you are either a germophobe, or have some form of OCD. As I don't believe outside clothes bother most people as much as it does you. What does he do for work? Manual labor or a type of desk job? Sure if comes home covered in engine oil, or grease, or visible stains, or things that will leave the bedding clearly \"dirty\", yeah that's gross. \n\nThis is something that he will need time to adjust to, and yes he needs to mind this for you, but you also need to understand this is a process.

This sounds like OCD and you need to get some therapy and a better understanding of germs in general.", "If there\u2019s a medical reason for keeping outside clothes off the bed, then I\u2019d say N T A; people who have allergies tend to keep their beds or even the entire bedroom an \u201callergen free zone\u201d - no pets, no outside clothes, wash before bed, etc. (This is common advice from allergists.) Those who think this is excessive have never had treatment-resistant allergies or never had to sleep next to someone with bad allergic rhinitis. \n\nIf it\u2019s not like the reason above, then I\u2019d say N A H- this varies by culture and person, as other people have mentioned. There are plenty of non-OCD people who have this rule, so you\u2019d need to work it out with your partner. \n\nIf your \u201cpossibly OCD\u201d symptoms are causing you distress for this and other things, seeking out treatment is ideal, because it can really improve quality of life.", "yta let the man rest when he gets in from work jfc", "YTA - Massive overreaction on your part.

YOU'RE the one with the hang-up about \"outside clothes,\" so you can only dictate that rule for yourself, and it's ridiculous that you impose your self-admittedly OCD behavior on your boyfriend and want to force him to adapt that same behavior when you, yourself acknowledge that it's not a rational behavior.\n\nYour concern about \"outside clothes\" being somehow contaminated with some vague grossness is what needs to be addressed by a professional.

We both take public transport everywhere and I can't stand the thought of him sitting on a dirty, germ infested train, and then coming home and laying in our bed with those same clothes on.\n\nI pointed this out to him the first time I saw him do it, and he didn't really see what the big deal was but he said he'd try to be mindful of it. \n\nLast night he came home from work, and what do you know, decides to lay down in our bed with his filthy outside clothes on. I had literally JUST washed all of our bedding, and was extremely upset that now I'd have to do it all over again. I confronted him about it, and he told me that he had a long and hard day at work and just felt like he needed to decompress for a bit. I asked him why he couldn't do that on the couch then, or even just shower and change his clothes first. \n\nHe told me I was being an asshole and that I didn't seem to care about how he was feeling. I reminded him that we'd already talked about this, and that he *knows* I don't like it. I understand that outside clothes on the bed don't bother him in the same way it does me...but this is seriously one small ask and I feel like he should be willing to compromise, especially because he knows it drives me insane.

We have a cheap \"quilt\" (machine made) on top of our bed so we can snuggle our dog while keeping her nails/hair etc off of the bed. \n\n(When my spouse finishes work we all lay on the bed in a pile for \"family cuddle time\")", "Do you ever sit down on the couch in your sleepwear, like pyjamas?\n\nIf you do, by your own definition you are tracking filth and germs into your bed afterwards as well; you allow outside clothing on the sofa, as per your words.", "Then take them off the bed when you aren't using them!!", "I\u2019m white and I 100% agree. Some people are just gross lol\ud83d\ude43", "Ok but this was after work and he wasn\u2019t planning to go anywhere for the rest of the night. It\u2019s not like he would have needed to change his clothes multiple times. Neither of us are ever coming and going multiple times a day.", "Genuinely curious why it is a huge ask? He wasn\u2019t going anywhere for the rest of the night - he would not have needed to change his clothes several times.", "She doesn't need to see a therapist, her behavior is normal, she is just being hygenic. I would never lie in my bed with outside clothes, and most I people also don't. But I live in Europe, most people also take off their shoes inside.", "Imo this does sound like semantics to me. OP has clarified that the BF was in their bed, and the title says he *got his clothes on the bed* not that he was on the bed, it\u2019s a weird but unclear sentence structure and fixating on it is a semantic thing.", "You\u2019re being pedantic. Especially since she\u2019s clarifying her statement now.", "I\u2019m sorry I worded that poorly. I mean to say that partner knew this boundary and was aware of it, but chose to disrespect it. When OP reminded of boundary, partner invalidated their feelings by saying that they were an AH for bringing it up and (implied) that OP boundary was less important than partner\u2019s want to be on the bed. I didn\u2019t mean multiple times of invalidation, and sorry if I wrote it poorly to read as that", "When I meant social space, I mean that if you had guests over, you likely would hang out around the couch and not in your bed (for the majority of general guests)\nI don\u2019t think it could be considered OCD; it seems to be the same practice as taking shoes off upon entering a home or no shoes on the bed, or washing hands before cooking food (the food gets cooked so the germs/bacteria go away, but it\u2019s still practiced to do so)", "In this instance it does get tedious, and I would say no. Asking for this would be pushing OCD tendencies, but I think a lot of it is perception because if you come straight from being somewhere deemed dirty and then enter what OP sees as a safe/clean space (bed) that would feel overtly unhygienic; however, the third step in between would psychologically \u201cremove\u201d the association in a sense that would diminish the feeling of unhygienic. Objectively from a pure scientific standpoint, it doesn\u2019t make a difference; however, then the same principle could be applied to food preparation, in which you would need to stop and re wash everything if you are to open a cupboard/fridge/etc where you may touch prior to washing your hands unless you are to deep clean everything before starting (which is excessive). OP isn\u2019t asking for deep clean or reserving all spaces, just the bed", "If the first thing partner wanted to do was lay down, partner could have laid on the couch. Why take the extra time to get to the bed specifically when they know their partner doesn\u2019t appreciate that?", "Much more involved? It\u2019s honestly insane to me the amount of people on here that think spending ONE MINUTE changing into clean pajamas is a huge ask. Like are you for real? Is it *that* hard? Please.", "I'd definitely rewash them so I don't forget. As someone with allergies, it wouldn't even be a question", "Thats great- unless you have a PhD/Psy.D or are an M.D with a specialization in psychiatry, my statement still stands. Cope.", "That makes sense and would be a good compromise!", "We have a beagle shield for our bed. It's SO freaking helpful. It's also just a decent store bought blanket but it looks nice and keeps our sheets clean.", "I think you need to change your mindset surrounding reasonable accommodations in your home, from another person with OCD. \n\nWhether or not it\u2019s a huge inconvenience is kind of besides the point. Your partner previously acknowledged previously your preference and said he would keep it in mind. He had a hard day and prioritized his comfort over yours briefly, and that\u2019s okay. It might not seem like it to you, but it\u2019s okay for him to prioritize himself over you in this brief instance. And then instead of getting mad at him, you can figure out a way to self sooth your anxiety around the bed in this single instance and give him that grace that he\u2019s doing something not normal because he had a particularly trying day. \n\nHe\u2019s the only one compromising here by abiding by no outside clothes in the bed most of the time. You\u2019re not compromising at all if you hammer into him when he\u2019s had a bad day and just needs to prioritize himself for a second.", "It's disordered thinking controlling not only your life, but someone else's as well now - and it's just over the top to not sit on the bed (or even nap IN the bed) with clothing other than pajamas on.  Shoes? Gross.  But my shirt and a pair of dockers  from the office for a short snooze?  Not a big deal. \n\nYou understand your rules and the reasons behind them - he doesn't have to, and probably finds them frustrating and arbitrary.  I get that it's something that really bothers you, and you are frustrated too - but this is a YOU problem that is affecting more than just you now, and it needs to be dealt with so you can both live with each other.", "Because he DOESN'T NEED to change, it's his home too and his clothes are fine.  You need some serious help, lady.", "It\u2019s not able this single instance. It\u2019s an entirely different way of living life to not wear outside clothes in bed forever. Also to understand your rules around outside clothes and follow them when they are likely not reasoned rules because OCD is not an illness of reason (as someone with OCD myself).", "Because he is tired. YTA OP, just because it\u2019s not a big deal to you doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not to him. The same way he doesn\u2019t think work clothes on bed are a big deal. You need to compromise but you don\u2019t want to compromise, you want things done your way.", "Actually no, her behavior is not normal. You being the same doesn't mean that it is a normal behavior. It is controlling and irrational.", "That might be normal for where you live and your life, but it's not normal to have that much of a repulsion reaction.  And she was the one who brought up having OCD tendencies, so I'm not sure why you are overlooking that - nor did she answer whether or not she had other things with rules about them he had to adapt to because of her issues.\n\nI take my shoes off at home as well, because shoes are gross.  But clothing is not if you're not actively doing something dirty.  And there have been days that I have laid down for an hour after getting home, before I changed clothes or took a shower and amazingly, I have not died of a lack of hygiene.", "It\u2019s actually completely okay for OPs boyfriend to prioritize his needs in this singular situation over hers. That\u2019s not invalidating at all, that\u2019s what compromise means and couples do that shit all the time because they underarms they\u2019re not always the most important person in every room. And he didn\u2019t call her an asshole for bringing it up, he called her an asshole after she repeatedly tried to get him to change when he\u2019d already expressed that he was tired and wanted to rest. \n\nOP is responsible for managing their OCD-type experience more than anyone else is responsible for managing it for them. Sometimes that\u2019s asking your partner to be mindful of your compulsions and sometimes is recognizing that your compulsions aren\u2019t always the priority and being able to sooth yourself when there is a rare occasion (which we should assume is the case there) that they aren\u2019t being accommodated.", "\u2026nah, if him laying in bed in outside clothes \u201crepulses\u201d her and she needs to clean the bedding again just because of his clothing, but him wearing those same clothes on *all the other furniture* is fine, then it\u2019s a her issue. She needs to seek therapy or something, considering even she says she might have OCD. Those germs will end up in their bed whether or not he changes clothes before laying down in it, she just doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge that.", "Why don't you ask him? Lol. You are saying the same things.", "So to be clear,  you are not at all interested in what people think and what their judgment, that you asked for, is.  You are just looking for people to validate your already made up mind.  Seems to be a pattern here.  Your idea of compromise is \"do what I demand\", your idea of asking for a judgement is \"everyone should agree with me\".", "The act itself is not difficult, but you are asking for a change in habit, not a single thing.  Behavioral change is very difficult, and you aren't seeming to do a very good job explaining your position.  You very much see yourself as right and him as wrong, not two people trying to coexist.  Your position is the one farther from the norm.  You really are being less reasonable than you seem to think, and therapy would be helpful.  I wish you the best, but as I type this I am laying on my wife and I's bed fully dressed, so take it for what it's worth.", "Put on your big girl pants and deal with your neurotic obsessions and get REAL HELP for your mental illness before he realizes how much better off he\u2019d be with someone who doesn\u2019t force everyone to tip toe around their clearly undiagnosed mental health issues because only what YOU want matters. My god how are you old enough to live alone yet alone be in an serious relationship with this ME ME ME mentality. You sound like a teenager.", "So you didn\u2019t post this to get advice on if you\u2019re the asshole, you posted this in hopes everyone was going to agree?", "What if he needs to go somewhere else? Just change again, so he can then change again after that? You sound exhausting.", "Yeah, that\u2019s also not compromise. \n\nYou came on here asking for advice and you\u2019re getting it, but you really seem to think that changing clothes the minute he gets home is the only possible option, and that there is no other way for you to deal with this. \n\nThat\u2019s just not true.", "It's honestly insane TO ME that you're completely UNWILLING to accept anything less than \"exactly what I want all the time, every time, no matter what.\"\n\nLike are you for real?  Is it *that* hard?  Please.", "The reaction can be discussed of course. But I take the public transport too and I have seen people with dried piss on their pants sit in the bus. I don't know who has sat before me and I don't feel comfortable plopping my pants, that came in touch with god knows what, on my bed", "This. It\u2019s not that the ask is huge or even unreasonable, it\u2019s that OP thinks she\u2019s right and he\u2019s wrong. The actuality is that they\u2019re two people learning to live together and it\u2019s okay if he sometimes doesn\u2019t want to change into bed clothes because he\u2019s had a hard day and she should be able to manage her anxiety around that without repeatedly going after him about it."]}
