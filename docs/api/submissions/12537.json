Immediately after moving in together, I noticed that my boyfriend has a habit of sitting/laying on our bed after he gets home from work, and before he changes clothes or showers. This seriously repulses me. We both take public transport everywhere and I can't stand the thought of him sitting on a dirty, germ infested train, and then coming home and laying in our bed with those same clothes on.\n\nI pointed this out to him the first time I saw him do it, and he didn't really see what the big deal was but he said he'd try to be mindful of it. \n\nLast night he came home from work, and what do you know, decides to lay down in our bed with his filthy outside clothes on. I had literally JUST washed all of our bedding, and was extremely upset that now I'd have to do it all over again. I confronted him about it, and he told me that he had a long and hard day at work and just felt like he needed to decompress for a bit. I asked him why he couldn't do that on the couch then, or even just shower and change his clothes first. \n\nHe told me I was being an asshole and that I didn't seem to care about how he was feeling. I reminded him that we'd already talked about this, and that he *knows* I don't like it. I understand that outside clothes on the bed don't bother him in the same way it does me...but this is seriously one small ask and I feel like he should be willing to compromise, especially because he knows it drives me insane. And frankly, it's just gross. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679080263, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11u0mhw/aita_for_scolding_my_boyfriend_when_he_got/", "score": 2248, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is not a lot to ask. Just like taking your shoes of in the home. \n\nAnd I don't have OCD. Does he otherwise respect you?", "NAH. You made a reasonable ask that he agreed to, but it also takes time for someone to truly unlearn a habit they've had their entire lives up to this point.\n\nBe patient. Perhaps a compromise could be made too where \\*he\\* washes the sheets himself again whenever he forgets, or have an extra sheet placed over your bed that you two can remove right before bed.", "NAH\n\nDifferent cultural or family styles.\n\nHow about a day cover for the bed? We have a cat that likes to sleep on the bed during the day. We have a cover we place over the bed after we get up in the morning, then roll it up and place it at the foot of the bed (or on the floor) overnight.

If he\u2019s laying \u201cin the bed\u201d, my mind says he\u2019s between the sheets, which is just oh my gosh, gross and disgusting. \u201cOn the bed\u201d sounds more like plopping down on a made up bed on top of the comforter. If it\u2019s the latter, how about just covering the bed with a sheet that you can then take off and wash, no harm done to the bed. Theoretically, should make you both happy.", "I don\u2019t think the boundary you\u2019re setting is too much. Laying down on top of a bed with \u201coutisde\u201d clothes on isn\u2019t really that nasty, especially if you have a duvet or other type of blanket on top.

I get mad at my husband for wearing his \"day clothes\" in our bed. It grosses me out, too.", "Soft NTA only because some cultures actually define outside and inside clothes. I was raised to not wear outside clothes to bed for hygiene, so I don't think it's ocd related. Subway/train transit has a funky smell, so I'm with you on this one, however, your BF may not have been raised the same way. Is there any way you can compromise? Like get a throw for the bed, similar to how hotels have covers.", "NTA, and I can't believe this is so insane and terrible to everyone in the comments. I do recommend seeing a therapist because it could certainly branch into more than just sheets, but that alone seems perfectly reasonable to me, public transport is dirty and to people who shower every day, this isn't such a big ask. anyway, I don't think you're the nightmare girlfriend people are making you out to be.", "NTA. I don't understand the 'OCD' commentary - I'm by no means a clean freak but one thing I will not compromise is any outside clothing on our bed.  I agree that the clothes you wear to go outside the house, especially getting on public transit, is FILTHY. You just can't see it.  I don't mind it if it's a bed that I just sleep in with PJs on.  When I was single I didn't care because I'm usually wearing underwear or whatever.  As long as my pillowcase is reasonably clean that was good enough. But a bed I share with a partner is different.  We get naked and have sex.  I want to keep it as clean as possible.  Unless you have sides divided and only have sex in one spot always under the covers, which doesn't sound fun at all.  It doesn't matter whether he's just laying on his side, or even on the bedspread.  If my naked body is going to get on it I want it clean.", "NTA. I don't have OCD, but I agree with this. Shoes off at the door and no street clothes on the bed. I would have him wash his face and hands before kissing and grabbing on me also. I would do the same when I got home.\n\nI am ok with the living room furniture if the clothing is not from construction work, a lab, or something like this. If so, I would lay something down.", "I\u2019m not a germaphobe. I find even sitting on the bed in outside clothes disgusting, let alone lying IN the bed. NTA.", "NAH - both of you are reasonable here. The best solution is to get a blanket/throw which he can quickly lay down over the bed so he can relax without undressing. Get one with two different sides to it so he can easily make sure he puts it \u2018street side up\u2019.", "NAH, you should put a sheet or cheap comforter on top, he should be allowed to lay on the bed, then take it off at bed And I get you might already have a comforter, put one on top of it", "I think I'm gonna go with NAH even though I'm on your side here lol. If this isn't something you guys can compromise on, there's gonna be a problem and neither of you will be happy. I personally don't think it's that big of a deal and your BF is being a baby about it, but some people were just raised differently and don't see a problem with getting in bed dirty. \n\nWhen I met my husband, he was someone that would even wear his shoes on the bed. It was how he was raised and was normal for him. I found it absolutely repulsive. We worked on it through the years and now he can't believe he ever did such a thing. Now, the being dirty/wearing dirty clothes thing; I managed to convince him to switch from morning to night showers and not get into bed randomly throughout the day. He complied but did find it annoying. But once we got cats, I think he finally realized how much crap he tracks onto the bed. I'm allergic to cats and he likes cuddling with them. If he doesn't clean himself before getting into bed, I have terrible sleep and am absolutely miserable by morning.", "Soft YTA. This is complicated, you two have just moved in together. Getting used to living together is HARD, it is not an easy process. Both people have to compromise things that they used to do to please the other. \n\nNot allowing \"outside clothes\" on bedding is, well, extreme. That's a big shift for him to get used to when moving in with you. It definitely sounds like you are either a germophobe, or have some form of OCD. As I don't believe outside clothes bother most people as much as it does you. What does he do for work? Manual labor or a type of desk job? Sure if comes home covered in engine oil, or grease, or visible stains, or things that will leave the bedding clearly \"dirty\", yeah that's gross. \n\nThis is something that he will need time to adjust to, and yes he needs to mind this for you, but you also need to understand this is a process.

This sounds like OCD and you need to get some therapy and a better understanding of germs in general.", "If there\u2019s a medical reason for keeping outside clothes off the bed, then I\u2019d say N T A; people who have allergies tend to keep their beds or even the entire bedroom an \u201callergen free zone\u201d - no pets, no outside clothes, wash before bed, etc. (This is common advice from allergists.) Those who think this is excessive have never had treatment-resistant allergies or never had to sleep next to someone with bad allergic rhinitis. \n\nIf it\u2019s not like the reason above, then I\u2019d say N A H- this varies by culture and person, as other people have mentioned. There are plenty of non-OCD people who have this rule, so you\u2019d need to work it out with your partner. \n\nIf your \u201cpossibly OCD\u201d symptoms are causing you distress for this and other things, seeking out treatment is ideal, because it can really improve quality of life.", "yta let the man rest when he gets in from work jfc", "YTA - Massive overreaction on your part.

YOU'RE the one with the hang-up about \"outside clothes,\" so you can only dictate that rule for yourself, and it's ridiculous that you impose your self-admittedly OCD behavior on your boyfriend and want to force him to adapt that same behavior when you, yourself acknowledge that it's not a rational behavior.\n\nYour concern about \"outside clothes\" being somehow contaminated with some vague grossness is what needs to be addressed by a professional.

We both take public transport everywhere and I can't stand the thought of him sitting on a dirty, germ infested train, and then coming home and laying in our bed with those same clothes on.\n\nI pointed this out to him the first time I saw him do it, and he didn't really see what the big deal was but he said he'd try to be mindful of it. \n\nLast night he came home from work, and what do you know, decides to lay down in our bed with his filthy outside clothes on. I had literally JUST washed all of our bedding, and was extremely upset that now I'd have to do it all over again. I confronted him about it, and he told me that he had a long and hard day at work and just felt like he needed to decompress for a bit. I asked him why he couldn't do that on the couch then, or even just shower and change his clothes first. \n\nHe told me I was being an asshole and that I didn't seem to care about how he was feeling. I reminded him that we'd already talked about this, and that he *knows* I don't like it. I understand that outside clothes on the bed don't bother him in the same way it does me...but this is seriously one small ask and I feel like he should be willing to compromise, especially because he knows it drives me insane.

So my outside clothes touched the couch, probably for like, five minutes or more if my cat wanted attention. Then I would get up, shower, change into pajamas, make dinner, and go back to the couch to watch TV until bedtime.

Sounds like these people calling you an asshole would just tell their hosts to fuck off and trudge through their houses, anyways, because it\u2019s \u201cirrational\u201d. The fuck it is.\n\nYes there need to be compromises in living situations, but this isn\u2019t a zero-sum game. Different things bother different people to varying degrees and it all comes down to basic respect. He does not respect the fact that this really, really bothers you.\n\nEvery single person (including all of these Asshole voters) has an \u201cirrational\u201d thing they feel strongly about in their own home and they\u2019re just being hypocritical because THIS thing isn\u2019t THEIR thing.\n\nSome people are weird about dishes. Some people are weird about leaving the toilet seat up or down or closing the lid or having the toilet paper a certain way or taking the trash out before it starts to smell or having the living room cleaned up before bed. There are a million little things that we do to our home that make it our home and keep it up to our standards so we aren\u2019t stressed out all the time.\n\nIf you think about it, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find there\u2019s something he gets \u201cirrational\u201d about at home, too. And I\u2019m willing to bet you have changed your habitual behaviors to cater to that thing because you love and respect him.\n\nPeople keep saying you aren\u2019t compromising but you\u2019ve offered solutions and he\u2019s ignoring them. He pretends to care and tells you he\u2019ll try but then when he does it again and you remind him he makes you feel crazy for caring about it. It\u2019s not fair to you.\n\nI\u2019m not saying break up with him\u2014this is a natural stage in shared-space relationships (romantic, roommate, and familial included) that everyone goes through. People either adjust behaviors that they care less about than the other does for the sake of everyone\u2019s happiness or it eventually falls apart. If no one can change and grow together to make a home that is stress-free, comfortable, and clean enough for everyone, then it probably isn\u2019t going to work out long term. (Again, not saying this about YOUR relationship, just in general about ACTUAL compromise on a macro level, not the \u201cyou-have-to-compromise-an-equal-amount-in-every-situation-or-you\u2019re-an-asshole\u201d shit these crazies are suggesting. The world doesn\u2019t work like that.)\n\nWhat should happen: he compromises for you for this thing that clearly distresses you and is negatively affecting your life (i.e. having to re-wash everything again, which is time and water and electricity and burden) that he really has no emotional attachment to (he\u2019s just being lazy and doesn\u2019t care to change the behavior even through it costs him 60 seconds to change out of public transit clothes)\u2014and you compromise for him for some other random thing that doesn\u2019t bother you but bothers him. It goes back and forth until it becomes habit and doesn\u2019t even take a second thought anymore.\n\nRelationships are give and take in terms of compromise and basic respect.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to people telling you that you need medical help over this one issue. There are people who don\u2019t wash their hands after taking a shit in a BDubs and then shove their dirty paws all over a shared plate of hot wings. Some people don\u2019t wipe their ass. Some people wear the same clothes for days. Some people leave rotting food around their house. Some people live with infestations without blinking an eye.\n\nPeople have different standards. No one should judge you and tell you you\u2019re crazy for wanting to keep your place clean and healthy. Definitely judge the animals who don\u2019t wash their hands after pooping, tho. Gross fuckers should be blasted into the sun.\n\nI\u2019ve been through this exact situation a bunch in my own relationship. It gets rough when a person discounts your feelings over something \u201cirrelevant\u201d or \u201cirrational\u201d. But I promise it will get better if both parties care enough to work through it TOGETHER.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend reading this article.

In dangerous situations, that \"I've gotta get tf out of here NOW\" feeling keeps us alive. It only becomes disordered when that anxiety is out of proportion (full panic attacks over very small issues in the grand scheme) or when it is happing when it shouldn't (persistent anxiety at things that one doesn't have any reason to be anxious about.) Inherently, disordered anxiety is not particularly rational, which is why explaining to someone having a panic attack that their anxiety is unfounded and saying they don't have to worry isn't likely to work.
