It\u2019s her wedding, her decisions. Similarly, it\u2019s your right and your decision to decline putting yourself in this situation. \n\nSince she is family I recommend you attend the ceremony. That\u2019s what\u2019s most meaningful and respectful. Encourage your SO to attend but don\u2019t put yourself in that situation if you really can\u2019t fathom being there.", "Stop being a participant in your own abuse. Do not go. NTA", "Ok, I don't think of you as an a&#*#  but I have to ask. The table, is it all family? Because if you ask the bride, that her sister and husband are excluded from that, you may be wrong. What does your wife say? Do you two want to be seated at another table? Do you have to sit close to him? As beside or opposite? You have to do what's right for you, but remember your wife is her sister. Its not necessarily about you. (Sorry, English is not my main language )", "NTA listen sister. YOUR mental health is paramount. Don\u2019t go. They don\u2019t care about you, why should you care about them?! Enough is enough. Put your big girl panties and assert yourself! Unless, of course, you want to unravel at the wedding and cause a scene.", "NTA for asking. Don\u2019t keep pushing this though. I would go to the ceremony, say congratulations to Nat after, and then skip the reception. Lily can either stay or leave with you, but you should encourage her to make her own decision about it and ensure her you won\u2019t be upset if she stays.", "NTA.  I would go to the wedding. Reception I would scope out  the place settings and if you're seated by him I would leave.  I don't get why they cater to BIL but not you too as you are Lily's partner.  Mental health matters!\n\nIf Nat gets upset we told you why.  You didn't listen.  It is on her.  Honestly I don't think your ask of not sitting by him was a big request.", "NTA You request was denied.  Now, you get to decide to suck it up and go and to just not go. The ball is in your court.", "Politely wish her the best for her wedding day and decline the invitation. Don't make it a huge stink, just let her know that you love her but you can't be near Ben and you hope the day is amazing. Offer to take her out another time for dinner. \n\nYou're stressed about it, but she's obviously also stressed about it. Stop compounding her stress with yours. Remove yourself from the situation. \n\nNTA but if you keep pushing her, you will be.", "NTA - stay home", "NTA. You sought accommodation, but Natalie rejected your request. For your own wellbeing, just stay away. Family doesn't come first. Self comes first... for everybody (unless children are involved).", "NTA, but it doesn\u2019t seem like Nat considers you a her sister, the way you do her.

You would be NTA.", "Just don\u2019t go if it\u2019s a big deal", "NTA, and I'm not sure why moving one or two people around so that you don't have to be at the same table doesn't seem like too big of an ask. \n\nIt's literally looking at a seating chart, finding someone relatively close in friend or family closeness, and swapping them out. \n\nIf anyone queries it (99% of the guests would absolutely not notice, and there's a good chance that the 1% that do have enough manners not to mention it to anyone else) Nat can just smile and say \"Oh, you know how these things go - in the end, everyone just swaps around and goes visiting, anyway!\"  \n\n\nWhich is true - a lot of weddings I've been to, the only table  still in their original seats after dessert is the wedding party.", "NTA only compromise I can think of is they have to hire a maid / nanny for here while she there because you will not be doing any of it. You are child free for a reason and it\u2019s a boundary they are trying to cross", "NTA", ">For unrelated reasons, I\u2019ve been struggling with my mental health to the point where I\u2019ve been on sick leave for months. I\u2019m more prone to anxiety attacks, cry more easily, lose speech etc. My in-laws are supportive. MiL and Nat have also told me many times that they\u2019d \u201cnever let him hurt me\u201d and \u201cgladly throw him out of any event\u201d etc. Nat went as far as to say she\u2019d \u201cprotect me\u201d from him. But they still insist I attend events with Ben there, lecturing me about how \u201cfamily comes first\u201d. I attended two events, and to others it looked like they went well, but that was at a great personal cost.\n\nI understand your intense aversion to Ben, but considering the \"great personal cost\" even being at two events, presumably not seated closely, I'd seriously consider sitting this one out if he is attending. Your response could well be uncontrollable, and not what you want. If he has to be there due to \"fammillly,\" they are not supporting you, Ben is awful, and you can chose to opt out for mental health - which lasts far longer than the amount of time a wedding takes. It's a shame, but it sounds like a necessary protective action.", "NTA. Not only would I not go, I know that in your state of mind I absolutely couldn't go. I might, just might, get to the door of the venue if I was really punishing myself but then I'd have to leave. In the past I've left trolley loads of unpaid shopping in the supermarket because I couldn't face the queues and have just run out the door (anxiety/panic attacks).\n\nIf this event is going to screw up your mental health then you shouldn't go. You are on sick leave in any case. You don't want to have to prolong that. Trying to go out for good things can be incredibly hard; but trying to go to something where there's also a chance of terror would certainly stop me in my tracks. Better to bow out gracefully now rather than run screaming from the room (my control is probably considerably less than yours btw so apologies if I'm overthinking this).", "\"Thank you for your timely response.  I'm unable to attend your wedding.  Blessings and hope it's wonderful for you.\"  Then block her and every flying monkey that calls you names from that moment forward.  NTa", "NTA. Don't attend the reception if you have to share a table with an abusive man who scares you. Enjoy the wedding and then head home. This isn't the Bride's responsibility to fix, although it should have been her responsibility to avoid in the first place.", "NTA. Oddly enough, this closely resembles a situation a friend of mine has been dealing with, that both of us agreed was edging closer and closer to assault.  No one should put themselves in a situation where they are risking assault. And this situation is risking assault. It's ridiculous to think this guy won't escalate.\n\nI know you aren't asking for ideas on how to get out of this, but I strongly suggest you commit to the event, make a show of making nice, and then report waking up with a high fever on the morning of the event. Or violent food poisoning. Something that is inarguably a reason to not attend. Let them gossip. But give Lily a way to save face with this pit of vipers.", "Please skip the wedding and do something you can enjoy without stressing out. I deal with anxiety and will do that to avoid things I know I won't deal well with. You need to prioritize your health over someone else's disappointment.\n\nAll you need to do is to tell Natile you won't be able to come. If she presses, you can just say that you don't want to be a distraction on her special day with your health issues.\n\nIt's the truth and it gives her a way to not stress out over last minute changes to seating. It allows you to feel better and Natalie will be disappointed but will have a heads-up that you won't be there. She can manage from there.", "NTA! It's not that hard to swap a coule of people after the seating has been done. Putting you at the table with a man who frightens and despises you is cruel and thoughtless.

So instead, RSVP to the wedding that Lily will be coming and you will not.  There are thousands of convenient lies that Lily can make up to explain your absence if \"what people think\" is that big of a deal... \"Oh, Intelligent-Money had to work,\" or \"Dammit, COVID again,\" or \"She had to attend her grandmother's 100'th\" would be my suggestions.", "Wow.  This post is so depressing.  A bride who is so stressed she has to withdraw from planning?  Why can't you just go and ignore the table assignment.   Surely you can sit there for 30 minutes and eat the meal.  Then - - - -social butterfly far far away to the people you want to see and connect with.

They make the world a worse place.", "The table we are supposed to be seated at is two of the groom's cousins with their husbands, Ben, Rose, Lily and me. She mentioned it being at the far end. Neither Lily nor I mind sitting at any table that doesn't have him. The cousin table, the friends table, all good. I am not worried about placement. I just want to feel safe and have a fighting chance of not crying at her wedding reception.

The people and relationships you choose, and that you nurture and receive comfort and support from are more important than relationships that are simply the result of family connection.

Of course you could say what he said or be vague and at least elaborate, did he threaten to hit you? Hurt you?  Hit you with his car? What? And that was 2 years ago?
