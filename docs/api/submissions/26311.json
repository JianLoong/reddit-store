You tried to prevent your friend from ruining her own party. Even if you never showed up at the party and never said a word about Ashley B to anyone else, wouldn't the results be the same?\n\nOne thing is unclear: Did your friend ask you to be the bad guy on her behalf and remove Ashley B from the invite list?", "lol, your friend needs a reality check, NTA", "NTA. Probably would have handed over admin rights as soon as I saw a name I didn't agree with. Good on you for holding boundaries.", "NTA, you warned your friend there would be problems if Ashley B wasn't uninvited. You didn't kick up a fuss, you told two people your reason for leaving and then left. It's hardly your fault your prediction came true.", "bwahahaha i loled. NTA", "NTA\n\nIf you don't want any problems with someone, why should you have to stay? This just sounds like re-hashing old HS drama and if you didn't want any issues, you had the right to leave.\n\nAnd tbh, they don't sound like real friends.", "NTA and I want you to ask yourself, truly, in your heart, how stupid and irrational do you think your friend is?\n\nIf you take her at face value, she would have to be incredibly stupid and delusional and you really should consider if that\u2019s a safe person to have around. \n\nIn her version of events, she\u2019s a sweet angel who couldn\u2019t help but invite the woman everyone hates to her party because she\u2019s so afraid of conflict and she just caaaaant do it, but she can start conflict with you and potentially more people about quietly not attending? She can\u2019t say no to this liar and manipulator because she\u2019s so so sweet and conflict avoidant but she can start an argument with you, her friend? She\u2019s able to start fights but not avoid inviting someone?\n\nOr your friend actively wanted to start drama, and you didn\u2019t let her and she\u2019s mad at you and she\u2019s lying because she likes being an asshole but not looking like an asshole. \nIn this version she\u2019s a reasonable, intelligent human who got caught playing around being a butthole. She had a reason to invite the liar, a reason to ask you to do the admin and also not respect anything you said, a reason to invite liar again behind your back after you removed the invite, a reason to be disappointed when only those who didn\u2019t have conflict with liar came to her party, and a reason to take it out on you, for spoiling her fun. \n\nSo who is your friend? Is she a dangerously irrational martyr to the extent of generously giving everyone a third chance and just so wonderful but also had a split personality when it comes to fighting her friends and being demanding and unreasonable?\nOr\nIs she someone who might enjoy drama and not want to admit it?", "ESH she didn't tell you that you could delete people from the list. If you didn't want to be there with her, the time to pull out should have been then. Obviously you're not an AH for warning other people, but that should have been done earlier.", "YTA for this long boring story.", "ESH you overreacted. You were the drama queen that evening not her.", "You were abused.  The victims of abuse don\u2019t owe their abusers anything - not time, not money, not another chance. (Well, one might legally owe an abuser money or fulfilling a contract, I\u2019m speaking morally here.)\n\nIf you ever choose to see Ashley again, it should be because you\u2019re at a place where you want to. If that never happens, so be it.  Nobody else gets a say.  As for your friend, they allowed you to be tormented to the point where you developed PTSD - they completely failed you, and that just doubles the reasons why they don\u2019t get a say.\n\nYour family needs to value YOU more.  They\u2019re putting the happiness of the abuser above the comfort of the victim AGAIN, just like they did when they failed to protect you from her when you were kids.  They can take a long walk off a short pier.\n\nNTA, not the slightest bit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You chose to leave when the problem person was there.", "What's ridiculous to me is that when I told her that I had removed her from the invite list she was worried about that causing conflict, but didn't seem to understand that if she ended up being there that it was going to end up causing far more conflict and that it was going to be in person with the possibility of it getting physically nasty.\n\n\nBasically I told her to choose the lesser of two evils and she just went nah I'm good.", "No, she wanted me to leave her on the guest list because she was concerned about causing conflict with having her originally invited and then uninvited.\n\nBut I knew full well that her being there was going to cause problems, and honestly if I had left her on the guest list and it had shown her as attending there's a good chance that nobody would have wanted to come to begin with.\n\n\nIf I can get her to sit down and listen to me I think maybe I need to go over with her just how serious some of the crap was that this girl started between some of the people.\n\n\nI don't think she quite grasps why nobody wants her around.", "So to clarify a little bit, she had originally created the Facebook group and was running it but had added me on as an additional admin to assist with the preparation and so I could add anybody that she may have missed.\n\nHad it just been dumped in my lap I would have flat out told her that there was no way in hell that this girl was coming.", "For choosing to leave and not deal with a toxic person?", "It would it be \"safer\" for you if your friend we're tb ask her would-be guests why they skipped or left the party. As things stand, aren't you the only one telling her how awful Ashley B is?", "No, just leaving is not the issue, the whole drama around it.\n\nIf you dont want to be on the same party as another person just leave. This was not OPs party, if the friend wants her to have her at the party, OP can decide to go or not.\n\nTaking the whole thing into her own hands, uninviting her and all that is drama, not the driving away part.", "I uninvited her in the hopes that she had never seen the invite in the first place and in the hopes of trying to prevent exactly what ended up happening.\n\nI personally knew at least six people at the party that I knew full well had had serious issues caused by her in the past and I was honestly worried that if she was there things might turn physical due to the history between people.\n\nAnd yes, it was my party because I was asked to help plan it, which I had done but when I realized that she was there I no longer want any part of it.", "You helping plannig a party does not make you the host, thats the person you helped.\n\n\nBut i get it, and if the uninvite would have worked without causing any attention that would have been fine.\n\nBut once the cat was out of the bag, you started to stir up shit instead of just leaving on your own and let anyone decide on their own how to handle the situation.", "Where are you getting OP \"stirring up shit\" or telling people how to handle Ashley being there? All OP did was tell two people who asked why they were leaving the answer to their question and then leave--as you suggested. They didn't tell the people they spoke to to leave, nor did they tell any of the other guests not to attend because of Ashley. Stirring up shit would have been telling everyone there that Ashley B was there or confronting her; they said they just got in their truck and left.", "Maybe, but the point still stands I only ended up talking to two people about it, and I only did that to explain why I was leaving, everyone else ended up deciding on their own not to go, I don't know if it's because they showed up and found out she was there or if word got back to them some other way.\n\nBut I can hardly be blamed for what happened when I was gone before anyone else even showed up."]}
