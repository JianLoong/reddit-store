You tried to prevent your friend from ruining her own party. Even if you never showed up at the party and never said a word about Ashley B to anyone else, wouldn't the results be the same?\n\nOne thing is unclear: Did your friend ask you to be the bad guy on her behalf and remove Ashley B from the invite list?", "lol, your friend needs a reality check, NTA", "NTA.

This just sounds like re-hashing old HS drama and if you didn't want any issues, you had the right to leave.\n\nAnd tbh, they don't sound like real friends.", "NTA and I want you to ask yourself, truly, in your heart, how stupid and irrational do you think your friend is?\n\nIf you take her at face value, she would have to be incredibly stupid and delusional and you really should consider if that\u2019s a safe person to have around. \n\nIn her version of events, she\u2019s a sweet angel who couldn\u2019t help but invite the woman everyone hates to her party because she\u2019s so afraid of conflict and she just caaaaant do it, but she can start conflict with you and potentially more people about quietly not attending? She can\u2019t say no to this liar and manipulator because she\u2019s so so sweet and conflict avoidant but she can start an argument with you, her friend? She\u2019s able to start fights but not avoid inviting someone?\n\nOr your friend actively wanted to start drama, and you didn\u2019t let her and she\u2019s mad at you and she\u2019s lying because she likes being an asshole but not looking like an asshole. \nIn this version she\u2019s a reasonable, intelligent human who got caught playing around being a butthole. She had a reason to invite the liar, a reason to ask you to do the admin and also not respect anything you said, a reason to invite liar again behind your back after you removed the invite, a reason to be disappointed when only those who didn\u2019t have conflict with liar came to her party, and a reason to take it out on you, for spoiling her fun. \n\nSo who is your friend? Is she a dangerously irrational martyr to the extent of generously giving everyone a third chance and just so wonderful but also had a split personality when it comes to fighting her friends and being demanding and unreasonable?\nOr\nIs she someone who might enjoy drama and not want to admit it?", "ESH she didn't tell you that you could delete people from the list. If you didn't want to be there with her, the time to pull out should have been then. Obviously you're not an AH for warning other people, but that should have been done earlier.", "YTA for this long boring story.", "ESH you overreacted. You were the drama queen that evening not her.", "You were abused.  The victims of abuse don\u2019t owe their abusers anything - not time, not money, not another chance.

If that never happens, so be it.  Nobody else gets a say.  As for your friend, they allowed you to be tormented to the point where you developed PTSD - they completely failed you, and that just doubles the reasons why they don\u2019t get a say.\n\nYour family needs to value YOU more.  They\u2019re putting the happiness of the abuser above the comfort of the victim AGAIN, just like they did when they failed to protect you from her when you were kids.

If only 5/24 people showed up after just HEARING this girl was gonna be there, and she still doesn't think she needed to be excluded, then your friend isn't as drama free as you think she is.
