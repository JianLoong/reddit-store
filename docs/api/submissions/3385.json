She came for your throat and you didn\u2019t lay down and take it. Let her stew.", "NTA.\n\nYour FIL told her to stay out of it because he knew how it would go. Everyone knows she is the one in the wrong but they are so used to not rocking the boat they expect the same from you. Do not apologise. It's about MIL learned that she cannot just say what she wants with no consequences.", "NTA \n\nIf my opinion matters, \n\nI would not apologize. I don't think that you said anything to warrant an apology. You don't seem to think that you said  anything to warrant an apology at this time.  That may change. That decision is yours, and yours alone. \n\nDon't apologize simply because your boyfriend wants you to. He's \"out of it\".\n\nYou were having a civil conversation with your FIL. Your MIL wanted to turn it into a confrontation. Your FIL asked her to stop intersecting rude, derogatory comments into a civil conversation multiple times. Your MIL continued to do so. She got the confrontation that she was seeking.\n\nI believe the expression is, \"Be careful what you ask for\".", "NTA and don't you dare to apologize. He should be standing by your side all that time and stop her and let her know, that her behavior is unacceptable. You may have crossed the line a bit (just a bit!!) but you have pointed out the truth and a facts! So do not apologize for damn facts! Next thing you know people will demand an apology when you say that running water is wet.", "NTA, stand your ground", "NTA. She's toxic. You should be pressing for no-contact. Your husband should be sticking up for you the way she talks. Really unacceptable.", "NTA. Don't apologize. She fucked around and she heard some hard truths in response.", "Man, the \u201cand I\u2019m an alcoholic!\u201d line was so good and now I\u2019m disappointed in your boyfriend for wanting you to apologize. NTA", "NTA. She insulted you and belittled you, why should you apologize first? Your boyfriend also needs to put his mother in line or stay out of it.", "NTA: You and your FIL could have stopped the conversation since you knew she was going to get involved but this confrontation with your MIL was going to happen sooner or later. She knows what type of parent she is and she sees what type of parent you are.\n\nSo she tried to make herself feel better by putting you down and you defended yourself - extremely ruthlessly, but truthfully.\n\nYou should not have to apologize.", "NTA\n\nI think you and your child need to stay away from her. You can\u2019t trust her to do anything with your child, just ranting like she did isn\u2019t something a child should have to hear.", "NTA, and don\u2019t even think about apologizing!! Stand your ground firmly sis, you got this!!!", "NTA but do you really want to be stuck in this crap hole family? Your BF is also spineless\u2026I\u2019d shit and fall back in it before I apologized to that woman.", "I was spanked. But, I have never spanked a child and I will never spank a child. I think corporal punishment can be an effective behavior modification tool. But, its still not something I support doing myself. My husband is a psychiatrist and his specialty is children's mental health. So, I do accept that he has wisdom and an arsenal of information about kids that I just never studied. I'm not insulted that he has knowledge I lack. C'mon. That's silly.\n\n But, you and your FIL were talking about the differences between study/experience/instinct. And no matter how many kids any of us have raised WE ALL USED TO BE CHILDREN AND HAVE EQUAL EXPERTISE IN WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE A FREAKING KID!\n\nSo, no. I would not apologize for speaking my plain truth. I get to disagree as long as I'm civil. \n\nName calling and red herrings are the anathema of logic and rational debate. Both you and your FIL engaged in indulging that. Time to act like grown ups. Empower constructive dissension, validate everyone's need to be heard, eliminate emotion and accept impasse. You know just the basic communication model behaviors that make a conversation an argument instead of a philosophical debate..\n\nYou and your FIL are equally culpable in being unpleasant. But, this is fixable. And on the strength of that I see no true assholes here.", "Nta", "ESH between you and your mom to result in this situation. \n\nNTA for not wanting to apologize if you're not actually sorry.

Thats \"there's always a risk anything you hit might hit back\".\n\nI was thinking more when a kid gets a spanking for smacking their sibling or another kid on the playground. That spanking just teaches that hurting others *is* ok actually, but only in certain situations, like when you are bigger and in a position of power.\n\nSuper sorry you ever got the belt though, I dont even think of a belt as \"spanking\", a belt is just straight up assault and abuse.", "Oh yeah, now when I hear a belt unbuckle I kinda panic for a second.
