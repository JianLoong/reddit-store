Everyone knows she is the one in the wrong but they are so used to not rocking the boat they expect the same from you. Do not apologise. It's about MIL learned that she cannot just say what she wants with no consequences.", "NTA \n\nIf my opinion matters, \n\nI would not apologize. I don't think that you said anything to warrant an apology. You don't seem to think that you said  anything to warrant an apology at this time.  That may change. That decision is yours, and yours alone. \n\nDon't apologize simply because your boyfriend wants you to. He's \"out of it\".\n\nYou were having a civil conversation with your FIL. Your MIL wanted to turn it into a confrontation. Your FIL asked her to stop intersecting rude, derogatory comments into a civil conversation multiple times. Your MIL continued to do so. She got the confrontation that she was seeking.\n\nI believe the expression is, \"Be careful what you ask for\".", "NTA and don't you dare to apologize. He should be standing by your side all that time and stop her and let her know, that her behavior is unacceptable. You may have crossed the line a bit (just a bit!!) but you have pointed out the truth and a facts! So do not apologize for damn facts! Next thing you know people will demand an apology when you say that running water is wet.", "NTA, stand your ground", "NTA. She's toxic. You should be pressing for no-contact. Your husband should be sticking up for you the way she talks. Really unacceptable.", "NTA. Don't apologize. She fucked around and she heard some hard truths in response.", "Man, the \u201cand I\u2019m an alcoholic!\u201d line was so good and now I\u2019m disappointed in your boyfriend for wanting you to apologize.

Your boyfriend also needs to put his mother in line or stay out of it.", "NTA: You and your FIL could have stopped the conversation since you knew she was going to get involved but this confrontation with your MIL was going to happen sooner or later. She knows what type of parent she is and she sees what type of parent you are.\n\nSo she tried to make herself feel better by putting you down and you defended yourself - extremely ruthlessly, but truthfully.\n\nYou should not have to apologize.", "NTA\n\nI think you and your child need to stay away from her. You can\u2019t trust her to do anything with your child, just ranting like she did isn\u2019t something a child should have to hear.", "NTA, and don\u2019t even think about apologizing!! Stand your ground firmly sis, you got this!!!", "NTA but do you really want to be stuck in this crap hole family? Your BF is also spineless\u2026I\u2019d shit and fall back in it before I apologized to that woman.", "I was spanked. But, I have never spanked a child and I will never spank a child. I think corporal punishment can be an effective behavior modification tool. But, its still not something I support doing myself. My husband is a psychiatrist and his specialty is children's mental health. So, I do accept that he has wisdom and an arsenal of information about kids that I just never studied. I'm not insulted that he has knowledge I lack. C'mon. That's silly.\n\n But, you and your FIL were talking about the differences between study/experience/instinct. And no matter how many kids any of us have raised WE ALL USED TO BE CHILDREN AND HAVE EQUAL EXPERTISE IN WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE A FREAKING KID!\n\nSo, no. I would not apologize for speaking my plain truth. I get to disagree as long as I'm civil. \n\nName calling and red herrings are the anathema of logic and rational debate. Both you and your FIL engaged in indulging that. Time to act like grown ups. Empower constructive dissension, validate everyone's need to be heard, eliminate emotion and accept impasse. You know just the basic communication model behaviors that make a conversation an argument instead of a philosophical debate..\n\nYou and your FIL are equally culpable in being unpleasant. But, this is fixable. And on the strength of that I see no true assholes here.", "Nta", "ESH between you and your mom to result in this situation. \n\nNTA for not wanting to apologize if you're not actually sorry.

That spanking just teaches that hurting others *is* ok actually, but only in certain situations, like when you are bigger and in a position of power.\n\nSuper sorry you ever got the belt though, I dont even think of a belt as \"spanking\", a belt is just straight up assault and abuse.", "Oh yeah, now when I hear a belt unbuckle I kinda panic for a second.

She was insane because I was married and she was very much planned and loved. But my mom had dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s. But the biggest thing that made her so mean was listening to Fox News. Once I got her off she became nice again. Fox and other right wing media have destroyed the foundations of family. It\u2019s addictive so they have trouble turning it off because if the constant dopamine they get for being right and smart and so much better than those other guys. A guy that used to be a pundit on the station wrote a book about it and I talked on the phone with him for about an hour so I could understand even more. I\u2019m still friends with him. I think he\u2019s trying to make up some of the damage that he was a part of.", "Yeah, that's generally how being abused works. You're not wrong that it sucks that he's not rescued his kids, but leaving an abuser is not actually as easy as \"my family who hold me in contempt have offered me money.\"\n\nIt typically takes women ~7 attempts to leave an abuser, and there are less resources for male victims. \n\nUltimately, while she deserved to be called out, you were still being cruel to two very damaged people (a vast majority of addicts are traumatised, as I'm sure you're aware).\n\nI maintain NTA on the main question, but yikes on your attitude to abuse.", "Okay! I like this comment. He told me that she called him the day after she lost her shit and was like \u201cshe doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to stay away every night wondering if your kid is alive or ODing on heroin\u201d which by the way, my FIL drove her to go get heroin multiple times with my MIL\u2019s knowledge and bailed her out of jail on heroin charges idk how many times. She\u2019s clean now, she\u2019s been clean for years but still just for backstory. So me saying that she had a heroin addict, a spineless son, and then my boyfriend came in with the alcoholic son hurt her feelings and my boyfriend thinks I should apologize for hurting her feelings", "I guess I\u2019m less empathetic to it considering my heavily abusive childhood and being in and getting out of an abusive relationship when I didn\u2019t have close to any of the resources he\u2019s been given. I think the only thing that would\u2019ve gotten me out of the relationship sooner would be if my child/children were involved"]}
