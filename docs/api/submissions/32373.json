My (14F) birthday is May 21st. The month of my birthday, my sister moved to a different state, and we went to visit to be with her during that time for 4 days (May 10th-14th) My mom said I wasn\u2019t getting any presents and the trip was my birthday present, but the trip was about my sister which she told me multiple times. I didn\u2019t try to make it about me, i asked to go to a trampoline park once, asked for a hoodie from the outlet and also asked if I could choose a museum once since she said we were going to 3. I just got the hoodie but I had to return it :(\n\nMy mom makes six figures but she has 4 kids including me, and she often expresses how it Costs a lot. I can\u2019t begin to think how much. I know the trip was a lot of money because of driving, hotel costs, museums, dinner etc, but I feel like a \u201cI\u2019m sorry Ella, I spent a lot of money this month so Im not able to give you a birthday present this year\u201d would have been better than saying the trip was my present and then it being about my sister. I would\u2019ve been happy with a single lolipop, but if \u201cthe trip is my present\u201d I feel like at least one acknowledgement of my birthday, like \u201cHappy Birthday Ella\u201d would be nice.\n\n I was mad at my mom for about 2 days and I tried to sit down with her and tell her what I felt but she cut me off and said I should be grateful I got to travel for my birthday. It wasn\u2019t even my birthday. Im happy I got to go to a new state and I know having kids is a lot of money. It\u2019s not that big of a deal, but it made me feel bad, and i honestly would\u2019ve understood if she had just told me. It\u2019s not \u201comg my mom ONLY took me to a whole nother state for my birthday and paid so much money ugh how dare she \ud83d\ude44\u201d it\u2019s that she outright told me the trip was my birthday present, which makes me think, oh maybe I\u2019ll get to choose some things we can do and then not being able to do anything or get a happy birthday because its about my sister.\n\nI was invited to my friends birthday party at a trampoline park (which was what made me ask to go to one during the trip since I missed it. I do gymnastics and love trampoline parks) which was on the 11th. it\u2019s mean because we were there to help my sister but I would\u2019ve rather stayed with my dad and gone to my friends party. I don\u2019t know if it would\u2019ve been an option but if I knew I mightve asked to stay.\n\nLooking back, it seems pretty bratty and rude because you don\u2019t HAVE to do something for someone\u2019s birthday, and I made my mom mad by complaining just because I didn\u2019t get my way. it\u2019s not as big of a deal as I thought it was then, but would it be wrong to be a little mad, just without showing it or is it just completely bratty?", "created_utc": 1701740140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18b0cqm/aitah_for_complaining_because_i_didnt_like_the/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've even said your mother told you as much.\n\nHer decision to defend her choice to emphasize her golden child and to try and get away with ignoring your birthday by declaring the trip was your present sucks.  If it was your trip then more input on it's directions and destinations should have been yours to make.", "NTA, sorry you deserved to be celebrated. Even as you say a cake or song or something.", "NTA\n\nIf you were in your late 20s through 30s I'd probably have a different opinion on the matter, but at 14 it really is a big deal. And to be told you aren't getting anything because of a trip for your sister? I'd have refused. I would have asked to stay at someone's house.", "NTA. You're still a kid and deserve to have fun birthdays about YOU. I'm sorry this happened this year but next year, talk to your mom CALMLY and with a firm tone about what you told us. Tell her it's your bday and this is what you want to do (whatever this is).", "NTA I cnat believe you got NOTHING for a gift! My husband and I raised 5 kids on both of us making minimum wage. We couldnt afford much but there was always a gift and a cake!", "NTA, you're young and whenever I was younger my birthday was more important to me than it is now. I can understand why you're upset about this. It seems like your sister might be the golden child.", "NTA What a rotten way to celebrate your child's birthday. \"The trip is the birthday present, but it's about your sister, not you.\" She didn't find a way to celebrate you at least once.\n\n>it\u2019s mean because we were there to help my sister but I would\u2019ve rather stayed with my dad and gone to my friends party.\n\nSo it wasn't really a trip, it was just your mother needing you to do some work and help your sister. She lied to you by saying it was a present to string you along. I am so sorry OP. And you are allowed to be upset.", "NTA\n\n> My mom said I wasn\u2019t getting any presents and the trip was my birthday present\n\nI mean, unless your sister moved into the Epcot golfball or something...", "NTA. Sucks. Not even a \"happy birthday Ella\" !!?? You were definitely short-changed. I don't blame you for feeling sad.", "Oh hun you shouldn't feel bad about wanting to be treated with the same affection as your siblings. Your parents *do* have an obligation to you, to be good parents and not show favoritism. I'm sorry they are failing you, but you are not failing them so please don't think that. This is poor parenting, any way you feel about it is valid and you shouldn't let others tell you they aren't. Believe me they will try to, but never let them. You deserve better, you seem like a caring and considerate person, sadly they are not and that is not your fault.\n\nThey simply use money as an excuse, when they clearly have more than enough. They are lying to you, they just don't care enough about you to spend the money and time for you, all   \nwhile your siblings get an equal quantity between them. Why should you go without the same treatment? There is no good reason, you just have terrible parents. It's not your fault, and you should be angry as hell. I would not expect much of any support past the age of 18, so I would get a job when possible and start saving. They abandoned you emotionally, they will almost certainly abandon you financially when they can.\n\nIf you have a school counselor it is time to speak with them. Please look up Parental Emotional Abandonment. It is what's happening. It's doubtful the school counselor can do much since they haven't done anything illegal, but perhaps they can call a meeting with you and your parents. Your parents are narcissistic, so its doubtful it can help but you never know.\n\nIt is time to say no to putting your sister first. Easier said than done right? But you DO have the strength to do it, you may just need the right tools and some confidence. The trip you took? You didn't have to take and you should't have. You have that power! That is one of those things you will have to put your foot down on though. You could have stayed at a friends house or somewhere else. When she said your birthday present was the trip, you could have make it clear \"That is no gift and I am not going. I expect to be loved the same as my sister, especially on my birthday and you will have to drag me to the car. We will discus why you don't love me when you get back. Until then I will stay with a friend and people that actually care about me. They will pick me up.\" Said simply, forcefully, without emotion and quickly enough they can't get a word in. Do not respond to anything they say with emotion, just continue to make it clear what is happening. *Grey Rocking* is the term, like the stone faces of Easter Island. Simply do not let them physically move you against your will. You are 14, go completely limp if you have to. It may seem childish, but your parents are narcissistic and if it works it works.\n\nI hope you find your way through this. You are worth the same time, attention and affection that your sister receives. Value yourself and put them second, they do that to you. \ud83e\udd17", "NTA\u2026 i feel like a lot of parents do not realize that kids didn\u2019t ask to be in this world. So I feel like the parent does indeed owe a lot to their child. You didn\u2019t ask for the trip, you didn\u2019t ask for a birthday dinner or anything\u2026 you asked for a hoodie and to go to a museum. You have every right to be mad. You didn\u2019t get your way is an understatement, you weren\u2019t being bratty and you weren\u2019t being ungrateful. You merely asked for attention on what was supposed to be your \u201cbirthday trip\u201d", "NTA", "[deleted]", "ESH. Sounds like your mum has an awful lot on her plate. It's not just the costs, it's the time she needs to give to looking after you all with washing, cooking on top of full time work. I know you didn't mean to seem ungrateful,  but I think possibly your mum is just so used to rushing to get things done, she didn't think deeply enough about what to do for your birthday. \n\nAs your mum's workload isn't going to change, I think as you're 14, maybe time to have a sit down chat with her. \n\nWrite down what you'd like to always do on your birthday- for instance, a birthday cake and blowing out the candles with your family all there to celebrate for an hour at least. \n\nBirthday present, max of say $40, with dinner with the family at home or at a nearby restaurant that you book for lunch or dinner on your birthday, with your mum paying for your food and drink.\n\nOr a spa treatment or a picnic with some quality time with your mum, that mum pays for, no friends or family tagging along, so that you have some bonding time. \n\nOne of the reasons traditions are important is because it manages expectations and everyone knows what to  do. \n\nThe above will give your mum a set list of things you want for your birthday to feel, seen and be heard by her, and that your family are celebrating you being there, rather than feeling like a nuisance. You're only 14 I know, but before you and your mum realise it, you'll be 24.  Make sure you choose a quiet time and talk to her alone, make sure she feels appreciated for all she does too, and that this is just to make life easier for her so she knows what to do, now you're older, for birthday celebrations.
