Both my wife and her twin niece and nephew (via her sister) have birthdays the past week, and so each person has gotten a day to celebrate their birthday with the whole family, and yesterday was the day my wife's birthday was celebrated.\n\nAmong the guests were my wife's oldest brother \\[42M, \"Dan\"\\] and his new fianc\u00e9e \\[35F, \"Tina\"\\]. Tina will be Dan's 3rd wife. She also happens to be Dan's former mistress (both of Dan's marriages and a previous engagement all ended due to Dan cheating). Tina is a fitness instructor, and must be very into healthy eating because every single meal we've had so far she's had to comment on how big or small her portions can be for each dish. I am very thin and have no interest in working out (though Tina has made many \"middle aged men need muscle toning workouts\" comments that seem directed to me and one of my brothers-in-law) and my wife is a beautifully chubby woman.\n\nFor dinner yesterday, my father-in-law and I made a big dinner with a lot of dishes that my wife loves. The whole point was for my wife to indulge herself and enjoy her favorite foods, and indeed she did. Later that night, my wife wanted a snack, so she went to grab something from the kitchen while I was in the bathroom. I overheard Tina talking to my wife and nagging her about how she was already hungry again.\n\nMy wife said something to the effect of \"it's none of your business,\" and as I was coming out of the bathroom, Tina told my wife \"you know, it's easier to keep your partner interested when you can be your best self.\" My wife was clearly very hurt by Tina's comment, so I told Tina \"that's rich coming from you, because no amount of time spent on your appearance will ever keep Dan interested for long.\"\n\nThis was, apparently, the wrong thing to say. Tina got very upset, told me I was being a jackass, then stormed off to hers and Dan's room. Dan later came out and told me I was being a douche and that it was low to comment on his cheating. I told him it was disgusting of her to comment on my wife's body (not to mention imply that I would cheat on her because of her physique - for one I'm not a completely horrible person, plus she's always been very chubby, so I don't even see the logic in implying that I don't like that). Obviously, my wife is very happy with what I said.
