I enjoy taking her to new places to eat and exploring exotic ingredients/recipes together. She is also active in the arts and crafts communities and always offers the nicest advice and whenever I read through the comments I could just feel how she made those strangers\u2019 days. I think I will never find another one like her. She is the kindest, sweetest person and all my friends and family love her - even my nephew who was a demon to all his previous tutors liked and worked well with Rose. \n\nRose is 5\u20198\u201d and weighted about 170-180 lbs for most of the time we\u2019ve been together. She is a bigger girl but to me she\u2019s just the most beautiful woman ever. I love hugging her full figured and soft body. I enjoy playing with the little extra flesh on her upper arms and stomach and the plumpness of her cheeks. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that her womanly curves are super curvy and full. One of my favorite things was seeing her in a bathing suit for our weekly swim - she was just so huggable. I\u2019m 6\u20191 and around 190 - 200 lbs for reference. \n\nEver since Rose became a grad student, she had more time to herself and started going to the gym more. She also decided to change the way she eats. We still go on restaurant dates and cook exotic recipes together but she ate less and often had half her food put in to go boxes and our new recipes tend to lean toward a healthier side now. Still delicious and exciting\u2026but it just doesn\u2019t feel the same. Rose is now around 140 lbs and she is very happy and tells me she sets 125 lbs as her goal. She also told me she got a lot of compliments from everyone. Her smile was just so sunny I could do nothing but tell her I was proud of her. \n\nOn one hand, I love how much bolder she\u2019s become but on the other hand I just miss her old body. Where her flesh was soft and squishy is now firm. I just really miss all that.\n\nI told myself I\u2019m being crazy and selfish. I love Rose and if she decides to change herself and she loves it and is happy, I should support her no matter what. From the health perspective, Rose was a bit overweight before and she\u2019s now heading in a healthy direction, all the more reason to encourage her to stay healthy and fit the way she currently is. I feel like a self-centered piece of garbage for wanting Rose to stay round and soft just for my pleasure. It\u2019s her body and her choice, after all, and I can\u2019t see any happy ending out of this hypothetical discussion.\n\n I didn\u2019t dare ask anyone about this for fear of being seen as crazy.

I ended up typing an essay in response and you probably don't need it but I want to explain to more people, so I apologize in advance!\n\nThe reason I want to weigh 125 is because that was how much I weighed at my peak physical fitness level (dance in high school, then retail running around a giant store all day). I felt confident and attractive for several years at that weight.\n\nThen I got a desk job. I've always enjoyed snacking, my family always made comments about how I could frequently put away an entire bag of potato chips on my own and still be skinny. When I stopped being so active, I gained weight slowly over the years, ending up around 155. I wasn't *fat,* but I didn't like how I looked. And any time I said something about my weight gain, people would always look shocked and tell me I'm SO skinny and I'm perfectly fine! Which yeah, I know I'm not fat (and that my 155 weight was also perfectly healthy and acceptable to stay at), but I knew I could be healthier and this wasn't a version of myself that was at my best. I couldn't fit into my pants anymore, and I didn't want to have to spend money on new pants and I just felt lazy for being like this.\n\nMy husband decided *he* wanted to lose weight, and he does all the cooking so I got the benefit of eating healthier too. I also got Invisalign (dentist recommended it to prevent more expensive procedures in the future), which has heavily restricted how much I can snack and how much soda I can drink (because the aligners need to be in for 20-22 hours a day to work).\n\nWith the healthier and reduced eating, I have consistently weighed 130-133 now for 6-8 months. I feel much better about myself. I would love to be 125 again and would describe that as my goal, but I'm also perfectly happy if I can stay at 130ish. I know 120 is too skinny, I am not anorexic or bulimic, my doctor has no concerns about my weight loss since there's a very easy explanation (better eating).\n\nThere are no health concerns, I'm happier, I get compliments all the time, I feel much better about myself. One thing that really sucks about being skinny is that you get low key body shaming from people, like because *my* body type is too skinny for *their* body, there must be something wrong with me being so skinny. But there isn't. It's just judgmental and it sucks to have my weight commented on negatively. \"You're too skinny, you need to put some meat on those bones!\" No grandma, I need to NOT eat a family size bag of potato chips in one sitting after having chili cheese fries for dinner! This is me being *healthy!* It's just what it looks like on my body!\n\nThis has gotten way too long though, I'll stop typing there.

That\u2019s *all* you\u2019re going to eat?\u201d when I ordered a sandwich and fries).\n\nI have a few theories as to why he was like this. The obvious was just his attraction to large bodies.

Another thing he was very open about was how, because of his psych degree, he was great at identifying people\u2019s insecurities and knew how to use those against them. I\u2019ve been super insecure about my weight since I was a teenager, and I\u2019ve struggled with multiple EDs and a mother who would shame me for gaining any amount f weight.

It\u2019s just him telling his preference and asking for advice.", "She could be skinnyfat at that weight though, by the way he described her. I used to be 114 lbs but over 30% body fat. Not very healthy", "I\u2019m 5\u20197 and 101 lbs. I am fit, healthy and feel perfectly fine, even though I am underweight.

It sounds like he has a *type* which she was for the majority of their relationship.  He didn\u2019t give any indication that she was ever unhappy with herself, only that he really liked her how she was.  It\u2019s ok to have a preference in body types. But also, he lives her and it sounds like she\u2019s making healthier choices.  So should he say something? No. But if she ever brings up that she didn\u2019t like herself that size, that\u2019s when he could tell her that he\u2019s always loved her.", "Have you guys never been in a relationship before? Your partner does have a \u201cbearing\u201d, and in healthy relationships opinions are valued.

But it more sounds like he\u2019s mourning her previous body than him being an arse or controlling or anything, because he hasn\u2019t said anything to her and is ASKING US whether he might be TA here, meaning he knows there\u2019s something wrong with that.", "This is so irrelevant since you don't know her body type and that's not what she weighs.

At that weight after one of my babies I was between a size 2 and size 0.", "Oh absolutely, but a lot of the comments seem to feel grossed out because of the way he talks about her body. It\u2019s just a bit frustrating that appreciation or even just attraction towards bigger bodies is immediately called having a fetish.

When 90% of people are overweight the public opinion gets pretty crazy in terms of health. Just ignore most people because they truly have no idea what they're talking about.", "BMI isn't perfect. But for most people it's still a decent indicator. And the healthy weight range is wide. For my height anything between 48,5 and 66 kg is considered a healthy bmi.", "No one claimed accuracy. Neither for males nor for females. BMI certainly has its limitations. It is an indication though, nothing more, nothing less. \n\nMy point was, his gf at 25 has every right and reason to change her lifestyle. More exercise, healthier food. Nothing wrong with that. \n125 isn\u2019t dangerously low as many claimed here.", "Don\u2019t give them any ideas, please", "My mom is 5'2 (like me) and was 165. She was fat. Wore a size 16.
