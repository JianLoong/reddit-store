I enjoy taking her to new places to eat and exploring exotic ingredients/recipes together. She is also active in the arts and crafts communities and always offers the nicest advice and whenever I read through the comments I could just feel how she made those strangers\u2019 days. I think I will never find another one like her. She is the kindest, sweetest person and all my friends and family love her - even my nephew who was a demon to all his previous tutors liked and worked well with Rose. \n\nRose is 5\u20198\u201d and weighted about 170-180 lbs for most of the time we\u2019ve been together. She is a bigger girl but to me she\u2019s just the most beautiful woman ever. I love hugging her full figured and soft body. I enjoy playing with the little extra flesh on her upper arms and stomach and the plumpness of her cheeks. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that her womanly curves are super curvy and full. One of my favorite things was seeing her in a bathing suit for our weekly swim - she was just so huggable. I\u2019m 6\u20191 and around 190 - 200 lbs for reference. \n\nEver since Rose became a grad student, she had more time to herself and started going to the gym more. She also decided to change the way she eats. We still go on restaurant dates and cook exotic recipes together but she ate less and often had half her food put in to go boxes and our new recipes tend to lean toward a healthier side now. Still delicious and exciting\u2026but it just doesn\u2019t feel the same. Rose is now around 140 lbs and she is very happy and tells me she sets 125 lbs as her goal. She also told me she got a lot of compliments from everyone. Her smile was just so sunny I could do nothing but tell her I was proud of her. \n\nOn one hand, I love how much bolder she\u2019s become but on the other hand I just miss her old body. Where her flesh was soft and squishy is now firm. I just really miss all that.\n\nI told myself I\u2019m being crazy and selfish. I love Rose and if she decides to change herself and she loves it and is happy, I should support her no matter what. From the health perspective, Rose was a bit overweight before and she\u2019s now heading in a healthy direction, all the more reason to encourage her to stay healthy and fit the way she currently is. I feel like a self-centered piece of garbage for wanting Rose to stay round and soft just for my pleasure. It\u2019s her body and her choice, after all, and I can\u2019t see any happy ending out of this hypothetical discussion.\n\n I didn\u2019t dare ask anyone about this for fear of being seen as crazy.

I ended up typing an essay in response and you probably don't need it but I want to explain to more people, so I apologize in advance!\n\nThe reason I want to weigh 125 is because that was how much I weighed at my peak physical fitness level (dance in high school, then retail running around a giant store all day). I felt confident and attractive for several years at that weight.\n\nThen I got a desk job. I've always enjoyed snacking, my family always made comments about how I could frequently put away an entire bag of potato chips on my own and still be skinny. When I stopped being so active, I gained weight slowly over the years, ending up around 155. I wasn't *fat,* but I didn't like how I looked. And any time I said something about my weight gain, people would always look shocked and tell me I'm SO skinny and I'm perfectly fine! Which yeah, I know I'm not fat (and that my 155 weight was also perfectly healthy and acceptable to stay at), but I knew I could be healthier and this wasn't a version of myself that was at my best. I couldn't fit into my pants anymore, and I didn't want to have to spend money on new pants and I just felt lazy for being like this.\n\nMy husband decided *he* wanted to lose weight, and he does all the cooking so I got the benefit of eating healthier too. I also got Invisalign (dentist recommended it to prevent more expensive procedures in the future), which has heavily restricted how much I can snack and how much soda I can drink (because the aligners need to be in for 20-22 hours a day to work).\n\nWith the healthier and reduced eating, I have consistently weighed 130-133 now for 6-8 months. I feel much better about myself. I would love to be 125 again and would describe that as my goal, but I'm also perfectly happy if I can stay at 130ish. I know 120 is too skinny, I am not anorexic or bulimic, my doctor has no concerns about my weight loss since there's a very easy explanation (better eating).\n\nThere are no health concerns, I'm happier, I get compliments all the time, I feel much better about myself. One thing that really sucks about being skinny is that you get low key body shaming from people, like because *my* body type is too skinny for *their* body, there must be something wrong with me being so skinny. But there isn't. It's just judgmental and it sucks to have my weight commented on negatively. \"You're too skinny, you need to put some meat on those bones!\" No grandma, I need to NOT eat a family size bag of potato chips in one sitting after having chili cheese fries for dinner! This is me being *healthy!* It's just what it looks like on my body!\n\nThis has gotten way too long though, I'll stop typing there.

I am small boned and that makes a big difference. I know someone who is 5'9\" and has always outweighed me at 130, she is very active in various sports including figure skating. She is big boned with a larger chest. 130 lb on me would look much different than it does on her and she looks thin. We are in no way built the same.", "Nah.

I went from borderline overweight to severely underweight in about a year because of the complex I was given by my ex. She wanted me to stay at a higher weight, partly because she found it sexy, but mostly because she didn\u2019t want me to be attractive enough to leave her and was insecure about her own weight. The way he talks about his partner in this post makes me want to vomit, especially because his girlfriend and I are similar in build. I love curvy, fuller women, but I wouldn\u2019t ever call a woman I found hot \u2018squishy\u2019 or \u2018round\u2019. His comments don\u2019t sound cute or loving, but patronising. How you\u2019d talk about a baby, not a lady. It\u2019s not as bad as what my ex said about me, although we do have to wonder if he\u2019s said worse to her in reality. I get a bad feeling from this post if nothing else", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that unhealthy.

There have been a few times I lost weight very quickly due to mental health issues, and my doctor never expressed concern  (my doctor is also kind of a doofus tbf).", "I have a pretty wide frame (broad shoulders, long arms, wide rib cage). You can see all of my ribs and vertebrae easily. I also experience some issues generally related to being underweight, like being cold all the time, fatigue, and dizziness. While this is my case, I very much agree with other commenters that working with a doctor/nutritionist is the way to go for OP\u2019s girlfriend. I do stand by my original verdict, as lots of weight loss in a short period of time, accompanied by a number goal that is right on the edge of underweight, seems concerning.", "This. With my frame and build, I\u2019m what I consider my ideal at 5\u20197 160 lbs. I\u2019ve seen pictures of myself where I was 140 lbs and I looked positively gaunt. 125 lbs would make me look like emaciated. When I read that she\u2019s 5\u20198 I was alarmed, but I looked up the BMI (which yeah is BS as a strict standard, but can be useful as a general indicator) and someone can seemingly still be perfectly healthy with those proportions. It\u2019s definitely much more about personal health than a specific height/weight ratio. \n\nOne of my friends is about OP\u2019s gf\u2019s height and weighs considerably more than I do, but she\u2019s much healthier than I am (eating and exercise habits). Her frame is also very different than mine. So \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnyway, to OP: YWBTA if you give your opinion on her body unsolicited. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with missing her former body in your own mind, or even admitting it if she straight up asks your honest opinion, but there are a lot of potentially negative consequences to offering that opinion without being specifically asked for it, no matter how good your intentions are.", "That\u2019s because on average people are overweight.

Congratulations, maybe!", "No I'm saying that this is a conversation that is super different and extremely personal for individuals- comparing anyone one to one by just height and weight is a bad exercise. 125 and 5'8\" might be absolutely healthy for someone and someone else with that height and weight might be extremely ill.\n\nLike only the person in question and their medical team have any right to say if it's ok or not someone saying it's ok for them doesn't mean it is for her. Someone saying that they think it's too dangerous and skinny isn't automatically right either. Not saying there is anything unhealthy", "That is underweight for her height.", "err", "Your original comment was that 125 is too low a goal weight, but it can be a healthy goal weight if you lead an active lifestyle. \n\nI didn\u2019t want someone seeing your comment and thinking it was factual in all cases.", "Omg. That came out of left field.", "Not just for me. For a lot of people lmfao.", "Edited my original comment for clarity.", "So did the assumption that anyone was interested in you.", "And yet here you are. Replying to me."]}
