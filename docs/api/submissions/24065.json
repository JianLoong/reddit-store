Familial backlash of course, if your parents are still around/in contact they'll almost assuredly start calling you every name in the book to try and get you to cave. But the real trouble will be that depending on where you live she may very well be considered a resident and it may be difficult to get rid of her.

NTA.", "YWNBTA\n\nIf y'all are in the US: file for food stamps for her. Reduces your worry of her having nothing when she leaves as at least a portion of her food will be covered. While she is still living with you it's an easy way for her to pitch in and reduce some financial burden from raised grocery bills. This is also true for health insurance, the state level free coverage will prevent a surprise medical bill either you or another family member will be expected to pay. \n\nFor the puppers: does your landlord / managent company allow pets? If not, that's an easy way to lose your home if the fur ball stays. I am usually one that holds with once you adopt a pet you sign up for the life of the animal, but never at the detriment of the animal. If she can't or won't take care of the puppy she adopted, she does not deserve the puppy she adopted and it should be re-homed to the best of your ability. It's not a problem you caused, but it is a problem she's dropping in your lap and one that will find you potentially homeless or the living being that has zero control in the situation suffering.\n\nFor kicking her out: check with your city's housing laws to see if you have to serve notice of eviction. If so, file whatever paperwork is needed by the city / county / state to make it official. If for no other reason than if she tries to stay past the date out of sheer stubbornness or entitlement... you can call the enforcing agency, such as the police / sheriff's office and have her removed. Not ideal, but it creates a firm line she can't wriggle out of or try to override. \n\nTake some deep breaths, you are not a bad sibling. You have opened your home for seven months, you and your girlfriend have been 100% financially supporting her. She is an adult. It's hard to adult sometimes. But it's also her journey to figure out how to do that for herself. Instead she is trying to burrow in and avoid becoming an adult responsible for her actions. That's on her. You have done what you can, that is all that is required of you for family. The phrase in rotation lately for this is not setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.", "NTA, but is she depressed? 21 is still young when there's been a family around to fill back on.  She may have a typical \"failure to launch\" scenario.\n\nHas she thrived ever?

Time for her to learn to be an adult, she will continue taking advantage until you stand up to her.  Time to tell her to leave.
