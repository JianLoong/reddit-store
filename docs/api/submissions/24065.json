While she is still living with you it's an easy way for her to pitch in and reduce some financial burden from raised grocery bills. This is also true for health insurance, the state level free coverage will prevent a surprise medical bill either you or another family member will be expected to pay. \n\nFor the puppers: does your landlord / managent company allow pets? If not, that's an easy way to lose your home if the fur ball stays. I am usually one that holds with once you adopt a pet you sign up for the life of the animal, but never at the detriment of the animal. If she can't or won't take care of the puppy she adopted, she does not deserve the puppy she adopted and it should be re-homed to the best of your ability. It's not a problem you caused, but it is a problem she's dropping in your lap and one that will find you potentially homeless or the living being that has zero control in the situation suffering.\n\nFor kicking her out: check with your city's housing laws to see if you have to serve notice of eviction. If so, file whatever paperwork is needed by the city / county / state to make it official. If for no other reason than if she tries to stay past the date out of sheer stubbornness or entitlement... you can call the enforcing agency, such as the police / sheriff's office and have her removed. Not ideal, but it creates a firm line she can't wriggle out of or try to override. \n\nTake some deep breaths, you are not a bad sibling. You have opened your home for seven months, you and your girlfriend have been 100% financially supporting her. She is an adult. It's hard to adult sometimes. But it's also her journey to figure out how to do that for herself. Instead she is trying to burrow in and avoid becoming an adult responsible for her actions. That's on her.

Find out your rights and the requirements now).)", "Or she\u2019ll become homeless and finally have to live hard and realize she needs to actually do things in order to live or she will find a desperate guy to use and leech off of", "And if parents get mad, oh well. They are mad because they don\u2019t want to deal with her.", "While I don\u2019t disagree that he may need to evict, how would she afford an attorney to fight to file wrongful eviction? She has no job. There are free legal clinics but you often need to qualify for them.", "There are many eviction defense attys that will take on a case, given that if she can prove wrongful eviction she may be entitled to substantial damages. Especially if they have a rent control ordinance that includes mandatory specified grounds for eviction. And being unemployed would normally be the qualifier for a legal clinic.\n\nI think she needs to go, but OP should make sure it is done properly. For OP's own good.", "It\u2019s pretty obvious you are not the A, she is, kick her out.", "NTA", "ESH - not sure if you're 26 or 23 based on your posts, but based on the last one you deleted, you really are AH for inviting a crazy sister into your house after the crazy cousin, your poor wife", "NTA.  Consult an attorney about how much notice you need to give her and how to legally evict her.  You want to do this right so she can\u2019t sue you.  She\u2019s entitled enough to do it.", "Your sister needs a reality check and you need your life back. Give her the 30 eviction notice and stick to it. Be prepared for the fall out from family members. Let the first one who gives you grief that you will be happy to help your sister move into their place. That usually shuts them up. NTA", "I don't understand why people in this position say that whoever they're asking about kicking out \"has nowhere to go.\"  If they're an adult, they have a whole world of choices. Apartments, rental houses, roomshares galore!\n\nNTA, OP. She's an adult. Let her be an adult.", "NTA but where are her parents?", "If she\u2019s of age, that\u2019s her responsibility not anyone else\u2019s.", "NTA. Get rid of her before your girlfriend breaks up with you. She is not a guest, she's living there, is an adult, and needs to contribute to the household both monetarily and to household chores. Your girlfriend has tolerated this a lot longer than I would have.", "Give her a months notice and she\u2019s out. Get rid of the dog. And turn the hot water off and don\u2019t buy food.", "Nah dude, time to go. She's using you and is a freeloader. Time for her to be an adult", "NTA, Just kick her out asap she is taking advantage of you and your kindness and that also without having her contribute to the expenses and refusing your wishes to get dog too in your own house wow that just WOW get her out asap. Sister or not you've helped enough 7 months is long enough for one to get a job and move out! Yeah just give deadline like in 2 weeks move out or will throw away your stuff you've helped enough. And treating your gf like butler wtf who tf does she think is she for treating her like that man you gotta be more stern with her she is too spoiled af and lazy.", "NTA it sounds like you're not the first family member to kick her out. I'd check with them to see how she behaves. If she leaves with a vengeance (stealing and destroying stuff), pack her stuff while she's out and change your locks. If she just gets mad, give her a hard deadline. \n\nYou only have to deal with legal eviction stuff if she's the kind of person who would sue. People get illegally evicted all the time and never pursue their legal rights. It's often not worth it once the lawyer is paid. Meanwhile she's not paying rent or bills and clearly doesn't want to get a job. Kick her out before you lose your gf.", "NTA. At this stage you have to protect yourself and your gf. A person who brings in a dog without asking and expects other people to take care of it is not a person you can live with.", "9", "NTA. You are doing the right thing. She needs to learn how to be an adult. Letting her get away with not paying and not cleaning up after herself would only cripple her for life. There are way too many kids out there just like your sister and it sounds like your parents didn't train her to become an adult. It's not your responsibility to provide shelter and food. Drop her off near a homeless shelter. The only way she will learn is if everyone stops helping.", "NTA. Pack up her stuff and the dog and get her out. She is an entitled brat and that's why no one else wants her. She needs to learn that you can't treat people like slaves and you must pay your way or goodbye.", "NTA - but please make arrangements to take care of that poor dog. It's not the pup's fault that your sister is spoiled.", "Kick her to the curb and be happy", "NTA- to quote ben franklin- guest, like fish, start to smell after three days. For her line about family helps out-yeah she's right. she's family, WHEN DOES **SHE** START TO HELP? At htis point little sister of no, you need to live your life and she needs to live hers.", "NTA for evicting your sister. And she may force you to go with eviction. Also, YTA  for letting her move in in the first place. You knew her history of being kicked out from other places. You should have had no expectation that you were special and sister would be an ideal roommate for you and you gf.", "**NTA**", "NTA \n\nMaybe give a deadline like within a month you gotta be gone", "Kick her out and keep the dog. The dog will probably pull it's weight better than she has.", "She should have contributed with the bills a month after she moved it\u2019s because she basically moved in with you. Tell her she needs to get a job and contribute or go to a shelter", "NTA. Time for her go and grow up.  She is grown.  Not sure why you let her stay without setting rules and boundaries.\n\nShe is not a guest and has overstayed her welcome.\n\nStop letting her slide.  She will rise or fall. It is up to her.", "NTA  Kick here out she is ungrateful rude inconsiderate thoughtless who wants that in their home.  Doesn't matter if she is blood related.", "NTA she will never learn until she is forced to. My SIL is 27 has been passed around family ever since she was 18. She got pregnant and still lives with daddy. We refuse to house her. The only time she acted like an adult got an job and apartment was when everyone cut her off. But daddy caved and let her back in. Let her be homeless she will learn.", "You live with your girlfriend (who must be a saint by the way) so your responsibility is to her, not a spoiled brat adult sister. \n\nI don\u2019t have a lot of sympathy for you, as you allowed this to happen. The discussion/agreements should have been done prior to her moving in and the ultimatums within the first few weeks. You should have been done getting walked out six and a half months ago.\n\nHer behaviour will never change when she has family like you that allow her to get her own way. Tell her to pack her packs and be out in the next two days. You would be NTA for kicking her out. She needs to grow up and accept responsibility now.", "NTA.\n\nA \"guest\" is not someone who sponges off of you for 7 months, she is a freeloading intruder. The sad part is it sounds like you're willing to allow her to live with you, all she has to do is act like a freaking adult and pull her weight and not expect everyone to revolve around her. What is her goal here? Is she expecting a free ride until the winds change and she has a better sucker to foot her bills?\n\nYou should show her this thread and the responses. She is going to have a rough life ahead of her if she doesn't grow up and learn how to look after herself and not blame everyone else for her own shortcomings. If what you say is true she has a trail of people behind her who probably have the same complaints the you do. At some point she needs to look inwards and say \"hmmm I'm the common factor here.\"\n\nIf you end up kicking her out then make sure she knows that she had the power to change her own circumstances all along, but she was too selfish to make any changes. She is holding you and your girlfriend hostage.  Good luck.", "Uhh, I think the mods should look at OPs posting history. Apparently, he's also 26 and kicked out his cousin for making his cat sick? And a year ago he was 22 with a male roommate?", "You're her family! She shouldn't be doing this to YOU! NTA kick her out", "YTA to your gf, why are you enabling your sister? You do realize she will never support herself unless she absolutely has to, and I feel like she will just be a hobosexual instead of even doing that.", "NTA, you need to kick her out because she doesn\u2019t consider you family based on how she is treating you. If she is treating your gf the way you say she is then your gf will leave and you will be stuck with a bratty sister.", "Your sister should be growing up.  Part of growing up is paying bills and becoming independent of your family of origin.\n\nShe has shown no movement  toward that goal.  Does she expect her family to support her for the rest of her life?\n\nYou tolerated more than most.  \n\nNTA", "NTA... its time for her to grow up and help herself. Give her 60 days to find another place to live. Then change the locks.", "Exactly! Give her the Fresh Prince version off get the hell out of my house! Just don't forget to add a return to sender label on her back! NTA"]}
