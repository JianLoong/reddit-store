Agreed.", "Found the guardian.", "Even if they had signed an agreement (which I doubt) it would be void. They were a minor which means once they come of age they can reverse the contract based on that alone. They\u2019re obviously not aware they signed anything so then it was deceitful which also makes it void.", "OP, if it's not in your name, I'd say just drop it off at their house and tell them \"Here's your car back, thanks for letting me borrow it but I've decided it's time for me to buy one of my own.\"  \n\n\nBecause if it's not in your name, that means it is not your car. It is their car. They can offer to sell you their car, but you are under no obligation to buy their car. And even if you were inclined to purchase their car, it would be under the 3-year depreciated value.  \n\n\nIf it is in your name, then it is your car. They can not sell you your own car.

A lot of universities have legal aid available to students at low/no cost, might want to ask them about that.", "If the car is in their name, or they are co-owners, OP might be in a little trouble tbh.
