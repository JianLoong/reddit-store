{"id": 1767, "submission_id": "yp7t5s", "title": "AITA/spoiled brat for not wanting to pay for my car?", "selftext": "When I was freshly 16 (about three years ago) for my birthday I was gifted a car estimated to be about $20,000. I had asked for a car for my birthday but as it was my first car I was not expecting such a nice one. I have never crashed the car or had any real damage to the car in the 3ish years I have been driving it, I have been very careful with it since it isn\u2019t cheap & have taken care of it, I\u2019ve always paid for insurance, oil changes etc. but I didn\u2019t realize this birthday present needed to be paid back. Once I turned 18, my guardian (who is not poor & has quite a bit of money) said that it was time to take out my money for my car. I was a bit confused because I didn\u2019t realized my birthday present was going to cost me $20,000. My guardian says they NEED the money so that they can upgrade their house to have a deck on the front. I don\u2019t find this very fair at all because I got this money from my mother who died in late 2019. I am a college student & live on my own now with my own expenses & I personally just wouldn\u2019t have even asked for a car & saved up on my own to buy one more affordable. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I guess I left out a lot of key information, so to answer some questions. My name is on the car but they are listed as a co-owner since I got the car at 16 & couldn\u2019t drive it by myself for 6 months after my 16th birthday as I only had a permit so my guardian drove it for the first 6 months & their reasoning was because it was a lot cheaper on gas then their original vehicle. To be clear the car was not lent to me it is my car. My guardian did pay for it with their own money & since my deceased mom\u2019s money was on \u201clock\u201d until I reached 18 I was not able access to any of that money. I don\u2019t have the title in my exact possession as I moved out recently & don\u2019t have my important documents at my place yet. \n\nAlso some more background information, AFTER I got my car there was some mention of me eventually paying for the car but my guardian changed their mind soon after that statement was made saying that I will have a lot to pay for on my own. As of right now I have yet to pay for really anything for college because my financial aid covers about everything & that is when my guardian rementioned the idea. Also this is not the first time where I have paid for a gift. There has been a couple more occasions, to name one for Christmas I was promised the new MacBook computer that was coming out later that year, when the MacBook finally came out my guardian went to pay for it but used my card. I never really brought up this fact as this has happened many times & I\u2019ve grown used to the fact that my \u201cbig present\u201d every year is something that would come out of my pocket. Also to reiterate money is not the issue here as my guardian is pretty wealthy. \n\nUpdate?: I did bring up to them my concerns finally after reading these comments & they apologized for always making me pay for my gifts. Instead of taking $20k they are now taking 15k so they can still have enough money to pay for their new front deck (but as I\u2019ve stated they do not need that money & very well could use their own) I also am making an appointment to change their name off of all of my credit cards so they won\u2019t have access to them anymore as I was going through my bank statements & realized my guardian has been using the card for a lot of items that are not for me. When this was mentioned my guardian said that it was an \u201caccident\u201d & my card was originally linked to all of these online stores I\u2019ve never purchased from because \u201cthey have bought something\u201d for me there previously. I think I just have to except the 5k off of the 20k car as a gift because I would really rather not take the only living/close member of my family left to court as our relationship would never be the same & I\u2019d be left \u201cfamilyless\u201d This year I will not be asking for anything for Christmas lol.", "created_utc": 1667872321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yp7t5s/aitaspoiled_brat_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_my_car/", "score": 538, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you take the ability to access your money, the difference will become crystal clear immediately.", "please dont do this just because you are afraid you will have no one left as family. you are still young you will find/choose your \"family\" as life goes on. this person is finacially abusing you knowing that they are your only family and you wont do anything about it. i know its hard being on your own for a bit but it definitely is better to be on your own then to let someone take advantage of you because you are alone. i can promise you that you will find better people out there to choose as family then someone who chooses to use you for what they can get from you especially when they are being so sneaky about it and then making excuses as to why something happened and still not giving you the money back that they \"mistakenly\" used", "NTA\n\nPlease find legal help. This is not only financial abuse but it doesn't sound legal.", "DO NOT ACCEPT HAVING TONPAY FOR YOUR PRESENT!!! They have been stealing from you and you\u2019re just going to let them keep doing it? Just because they are a relative doesn\u2019t mean they get to take advantage of you.", "NTA. It sounds like your guardian is stealing from you.", "NTA. I see from the edit that you are preparing to take on your own finances. It looks like you will continue to discover ways that your guardian has taken advantage of you financially, that is going to be tough to face. Even if you don\u2019t take them to court, prepare yourself for the fallout as you gain your financial independence - they are not going to like having less control.It sounds like you are not ready to lose this person but you should know they have not been treating you fairly. This process may lead to some nasty realizations about their character, just remember that it\u2019s not your fault.\n\nIt also sounds like they have raised you with some warped perceptions about family and money, so I recommend that you check in with other people about healthy norms. For example, it is NOT normal to pay for your own presents. That is literally just not how a gift works. It is also NOT normal to pay back your parent or guardian for the costs of raising you, just in case that comes up. It is the bare minimum responsibility for a parent or guardian, you do not owe them that money.\n\nGood luck, OP.", "NTA. Honey this isn't your family. Theyre robbing you blind. Do not give them anymore money(not even that 15k!!) And talk to an attorney. You are already family-less. You are an atm to them, not someone they love. There are people out there that will love you for you, and not your bank card. Go find them", "NTA it was a gift and you didn\u2019t know they wanted it paid back. If you had known, you might have bought something cheaper", "I would look into doing an audit of the expenses and funds they've been misappropriating as your guardian. You don't have to sue them now, but it would be easier to get all of that evidence lined up while it's still fresh and recent, so that, if things go downhill in a few years or decades, you won't be trying to find ancient receipts.", "NTA. What you are describing is financial abuse. They are stealing money from you by using your credit card without your permission. The entire car arrangement seems like a scam to bilk you for 20k. Are you sure that's how much the car was worth at the time of purchase? Are you sure that's what they paid for it? You're an adult. Remove them from access to your accounts immediately.", "INFO: you really want a relationship with someone who has been exploiting you and stealing from you for years enough to pay 15 THOUSAND dollars for it?", "Wow, are we paying for gifts that we receive now??? Guardian wants to be the hero of with the gifting, and when it comes down to no one is paying attention, they\u2019re like, ohhhhh by the way, imma need that money back from that car I bought you AS A GIFT. NTA, and my advice to you, do not accept \u201cgifts\u201d from said person, and just go out and buy it yourself. This is  bananas. Also, a car that is 3 years old, ain\u2019t worth the $20,000 guardian \u201cgifted\u201d now. It has depreciated. So they can just kick rocks for that. I am sorry but a loving relative would NOT do that.", "NTA - your guardian has been using your money for years.  You don\u2019t owe them a dime.", "Yikes. This person didn't buy you a car, they gave you a payday loan you didn't ask for with the intention of claiming part off your inheritance once you had access to the funds and they weren't legally stopped from demanding cash. That's disgusting, and you should cut contract with them if you are able. NTA, but run; you're in danger. This person sees you as a piggy bank and not a loved one.", "NTA. And this makes me sad for you. You\u2019re enduring financial manipulation because you want comfort from someone you consider as your only family. They disrespect you and you don\u2019t want to do anything about it because you want them in your life. Soon you will realize people who do bad things to you over a long period of time do not deserve to be in your life.", "Your update is really upsetting. So your guardian is only going to demand $15k of your late mother's money that THEY used to buy you a gift of their choice with?? That they drove around themselves for 6 months brand new for free? Are they crazy? And they've stolen from you by \"accident\" by using your credit cards?\n\nThis person might be related to you, but they are stealing from you and then trying to justify it and YOU ARE ALLOWING it. Do you have any idea how much they've stolen from you? YOU NEED A LAWYER. You need to find out who is in charge of the trust from your mother and how much has been paid out, to whom, for what, and how much is left. And if you trust this last relative of yours to be honest about that after they've continuously swindled you, then I can see why this relative expects you to keep letting them steal from you over and over again without any consequence. Please make them stop. Or you will look back at this in a few years, deep in debt, with all your inheritance gone, and you will want to go back in time and kick yourself.\n\nYes, this isn't going to be fun. But you absolutely need to get to the bottom of how much was taken and then take legal action to get it back and secure it in your name in your account that they don't have access to. Or you will end up broke and in debt, with no way to pay your way out of it. DO NOT ignore this problem or excuse this behavior. You can't afford to keep your blinders on about this relative. They aren't a good person. They keep stealing from you. And if what you said is true, they didn't even need the money. They just did it because they could, and because they have no respect for you and your property.\n\nIt isn't as hard as you think to talk to a lawyer about this. But you need to do this ASAP, before any remaining assets are stolen by your relative. You need to see those records of what was left to you, and how it was spent. PLEASE don't let this go until you get to the bottom of it.\n\nEDIT to add: NTA. But your relative is a con artist.", "They are extorting you Of course they dont want things to change, they have free money from you Get a lawyer!!!!!!", "OP, it\u2019s better to have no family than to have family that steals from you. Your guardian was entrusted to look out for your best interests while you were a minor, but instead, they have been stealing both money that you earn (I assume you had a job before you got access to your inheritance) as well as the money that your deceased mother left for you. They have normalized this to the point that you have just accepted it so that you can maintain your relationship with this person. Someone that loves you & that is looking out for your best interests is not someone that steals money that was meant to ensure that you get a head start in adulthood.", "Agreed NTA", "Also, it sounds like their guardian breached their fiduciary duty and possibly committed fraud.

The guardian did not advise OP that OP needed to repay the cost of the car at 18. OP stated that they received a nicer car than they were expecting, so I\u2019m sure if OP knew that their inheritance from their deceased parent would be paying for the car, they would have wanted to select a less expensive vehicle. \n\n2.

Why should OP pay the full cost of a vehicle that their guardian also used?", "I think it depends on the relationship with the guardian.\n\nIs the guardian someone who is close to them and buys them gifts?

You are being taken advantage of and it is a form of abuse. She is your guardian but she is not family. Family would not do what the guardian has done.
