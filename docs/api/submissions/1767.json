{"id": 1767, "submission_id": "yp7t5s", "title": "AITA/spoiled brat for not wanting to pay for my car?", "selftext": "When I was freshly 16 (about three years ago) for my birthday I was gifted a car estimated to be about $20,000. I had asked for a car for my birthday but as it was my first car I was not expecting such a nice one. I have never crashed the car or had any real damage to the car in the 3ish years I have been driving it, I have been very careful with it since it isn\u2019t cheap & have taken care of it, I\u2019ve always paid for insurance, oil changes etc. but I didn\u2019t realize this birthday present needed to be paid back. Once I turned 18, my guardian (who is not poor & has quite a bit of money) said that it was time to take out my money for my car. I was a bit confused because I didn\u2019t realized my birthday present was going to cost me $20,000. My guardian says they NEED the money so that they can upgrade their house to have a deck on the front. I don\u2019t find this very fair at all because I got this money from my mother who died in late 2019. I am a college student & live on my own now with my own expenses & I personally just wouldn\u2019t have even asked for a car & saved up on my own to buy one more affordable. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I guess I left out a lot of key information, so to answer some questions. My name is on the car but they are listed as a co-owner since I got the car at 16 & couldn\u2019t drive it by myself for 6 months after my 16th birthday as I only had a permit so my guardian drove it for the first 6 months & their reasoning was because it was a lot cheaper on gas then their original vehicle. To be clear the car was not lent to me it is my car. My guardian did pay for it with their own money & since my deceased mom\u2019s money was on \u201clock\u201d until I reached 18 I was not able access to any of that money. I don\u2019t have the title in my exact possession as I moved out recently & don\u2019t have my important documents at my place yet. \n\nAlso some more background information, AFTER I got my car there was some mention of me eventually paying for the car but my guardian changed their mind soon after that statement was made saying that I will have a lot to pay for on my own. As of right now I have yet to pay for really anything for college because my financial aid covers about everything & that is when my guardian rementioned the idea. Also this is not the first time where I have paid for a gift. There has been a couple more occasions, to name one for Christmas I was promised the new MacBook computer that was coming out later that year, when the MacBook finally came out my guardian went to pay for it but used my card. I never really brought up this fact as this has happened many times & I\u2019ve grown used to the fact that my \u201cbig present\u201d every year is something that would come out of my pocket. Also to reiterate money is not the issue here as my guardian is pretty wealthy. \n\nUpdate?: I did bring up to them my concerns finally after reading these comments & they apologized for always making me pay for my gifts. Instead of taking $20k they are now taking 15k so they can still have enough money to pay for their new front deck (but as I\u2019ve stated they do not need that money & very well could use their own) I also am making an appointment to change their name off of all of my credit cards so they won\u2019t have access to them anymore as I was going through my bank statements & realized my guardian has been using the card for a lot of items that are not for me. When this was mentioned my guardian said that it was an \u201caccident\u201d & my card was originally linked to all of these online stores I\u2019ve never purchased from because \u201cthey have bought something\u201d for me there previously. I think I just have to except the 5k off of the 20k car as a gift because I would really rather not take the only living/close member of my family left to court as our relationship would never be the same & I\u2019d be left \u201cfamilyless\u201d This year I will not be asking for anything for Christmas lol.", "created_utc": 1667872321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yp7t5s/aitaspoiled_brat_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_my_car/", "score": 403, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
