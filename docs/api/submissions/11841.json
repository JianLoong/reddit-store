My closest guy friend is like family and although my boyfriend asked me questions when we were first dating because of how close we are, he trusts and respects me (and also isn't controlling enough to ban him from my life). Also he's man enough to understand that were not romantic, but still love each other like family and has also grown to love my friend. I think the paying issue is its own and distracting from the fact that in one way or another he's trying to exert control over her spending time with one of her close childhood friends. While you and I probably have wildly different ideas about what were comfortable with, you and I are not getting married. People who are doing these weird power plays are not ready to walk down the aisle. Just as you would probably cut things with someone who felt comfortable going on trips with a male friend, I would probably cut things with someone who wouldnt be secure enough to allow me to go on those trips myself.", "No one is perfect in this world bud.
