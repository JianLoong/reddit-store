Honestly, you're an adult and it's up to you how you want to dress. Dress for comfort, I've seen guys here drive BMWs and they're dressed full in joggers and hoodies.\n\n It wouldn't be petty to turn them down imo, but it does depend on how much potential drama you want to deal with, cos he sounds like he might make a big deal out of it.

The way you present yourself to the world is a personal choice and he sounds like he's having a very hard time accepting that he's got no say in it.\n\nTo be honest with you, under these specific circumstances, I personally would gladly accept the clothes because good crafting material is expensive. The sentence \"Where are the clothes I got you,\" slowly trails off as they look at a sea of cute cloth purses, book covers, blankets, etsy pillows, and headbands. If they get the hint, the conflict is resolved.

That said your dad is TA for his gift choice.\n\nAccept the gift, give it to charity, someone will appreciate it and you will still prove your point.
