We\u2019re literally counting down the days in excitement.\n\nSome important information to keep in mind for now is that my parents are divorced, they have been for around 4/5 years now, My mother is very bitter about this, she always has been and always will be, along with the bitterness about her failing marriage she has had nothing good to say about me getting married and has openly stated she thinks I\u2019m making a mistake because she doesn\u2019t see the value in my fianc\u00e9. Not once since he\u2019s physically lived here in the past 2 years (we were long distance for 5) has she tried to get to know him, and anytime we have been around her she acts like he\u2019s just some stranger I\u2019m dragging around. Meanwhile my father and his wife (remarried for almost 2 years) have been so welcoming and kind to him, they consider him family. \n\nWith our upcoming wedding we knew we would likely be paying for everything and we\u2019re happy to do so, though I did ask my mother if she\u2019d want to have any part in helping I told her there was no obligation, I just figured she may want to help\u2026I was sorely mistaken.\nBeyond that my mom (who hasn\u2019t been much of a mother) is angry that I\u2019ve asked her to \u201cshare her spotlight\u201d (as she put it) with my stepmom for the mother of the bride walk. She claims she\u2019s not my real mother, biologically speaking she\u2019s not but she\u2019s been more present in my life over the past 6 years she\u2019s been with my dad than my bio mom ever has. \n With her clear disliking that my stepmom would be included there is more, I made sure my half sister on my dads side was included in my wedding partially because my fianc\u00e9 asked my step brother (stepmoms son) to be a groomsmen they\u2019re around the same age so walking together would work but also because she\u2019s my sister, she\u2019s important to me, I have a half sister on my moms side as well\u2026she has a history of starting fights, causing a scene, crime that she\u2019s been charged for \u2026many reasons I wouldn\u2019t want her to be a bridesmaid, plus she\u2019s just generally unkind. She\u2019s also in the same age range as my half sister and step brother. My mom has \u201cjokingly\u201d made threats to not attend my wedding \u201cto show me how it feels to have my feelings hurt\u201d so I can understand how I\u2019m making her feel\u2026she\u2019s been blatantly disrespectful as of late and aside from the mother of the bride walk wanted absolutely nothing to do with our wedding.\nAfter everything she claims I\u2019m asking her to attend out of pity and not because she\u2019s my mother\u2026.it\u2019s my day and I want to have a relaxed wedding, I feel in this aspect I\u2019m allowed to be a little selfish and avoid any problems my moms daughter could pose\u2026 \nWe don\u2019t find her lack of presence to be a loss and truthfully if it ends our \u201crelationship\u201d as mother and daughter I wouldn\u2019t mind \nso I guess I just want to know AITA?", "created_utc": 1700939614, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183r2vk/aita_mother_of_the_bridezilla/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She and your other sister get to spend that day together.", "NTA it's your day and i imagine you do not want your sister there due to good reason, and your mom sounds like she would disrespect you and your marriage.  i say do what your heart feels but keep in mind your fianc\u00e9 should also be respected it's his big day to, it should be full of love and laughter, not stress and fear of others' opinions and potential outbursts.

That is a tough situation but ultimately it\u2019s your wedding. I hope your mom comes to her senses.

Sounds like your bio mom has main character syndrome, which my mother also had.

Ideally, your mother and other sister will decide on their own to boycott your wedding. \n\nYour wedding should be all about you and your fiance and those that love you and celebrate your happiness. There is no reason to allow your mother and sister to inject their personal problems into your joyous dat!", "NTA. And you'd be okay uninviting your bio-mom too. You need to make sure you have two things in place. One is passwords for all your vendors. That way no one can change or cancel anything out of spite.  Second is security - security at the ceremony and security at the reception.  Because you know your half-sister will come and make a fuss, or your bio-mom will try to sneak her in. Plus, security will remove anyone who is causing a disturbance at any point.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUninvite your AH mom.", "NTA, but  this is also your fianc\u00e9es day. Why should his lasting memory of his wedding be the drama your mum cuases (which she will). \n\nYour mum has made her feelings clear, take her at her word she will only have herself to blame for missing her daughters wedding. \n\n\nEnjoy your day with the people who want to celebrate your happy day.", "She\u2019s a total narcissist.

Next time she threatens to not come say \"we'll have security to make sure you keep that promise.\". And get security whether it's people you know or hired security.
