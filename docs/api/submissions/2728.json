I have raised her on my own since her mother passed away 10 years ago.\n\nSince the beginning, I was not a fan of being a strict father. I came from a household like that, and all it did was giving me a miserable childhood and a strained relationship with my parents. And a crap ton of therapy.\n\n2 weeks ago, my sister's house got flooded, they found out that the foundation rotted. I offered them to move in to my finished basement with separate entrance (house built on a hill). So right now her husband, her three sons (16, 13 and 9) and her are living in my 3 bedroom basement (it has a full bathroom and kitchen/living room).\n\nUsually they have their life and we have ours, but we *hang out* for a couple hours every day. And that's when the trouble started.\n\nLike I said I don't have too many rules for my daughter. As long as I know where she is and she is back by 9PM, she is free to go wherever she wants (within limits of course), I do not control what she wears or what makeup she puts on as long as she follows her school dress code (and of course she dresses appropriately for special occasions), she does not have a bedtime, I do not check if she did her homework, she has a lock on her door and I always ask permission before going in, if she does not like what I plan to make for a meal she is free to cook something else/order takeout (as long as she informs me before I start cooking, and no ordering in more than twice a week, also she uses her money to order in). Now these rules are a result of me having a good kid, her earning my trust, and me wanting her to grow up as independent as possible while learning to self regulate and keeping her safety in mind.\n\nMy sister on the other hand is very strict: she has her kids on a set routine, they are not allowed to have closed doors except while changing, she checks their electronics all the time, they are rarely allowed to go anywhere, they eat what she cooked or they starve (if she allows them not to eat what she made that is), she is so on top of their schooling that I feel bad for the teachers (she always emailing them or calling them or even going to school), they do not get pocket money and are not allowed to work, and even the 16 years old has a 9PM bedtime school nights/10PM weekends.\n\nI don't agree with her parenting style, but I keep my opinions to myself. But now she is demanding that I give my daughter more rules, because her kids are comparing themselves to their cousin, and they are rebelling.\n\nSo I told her straight to her face, she either keeps her opinion to herself and parent her kids and leave my daughter to me, or she is free to find somewhere else to live.\n\nShe says I'm an AH because I don't know how my *lax parenting* is only adding more stress to her already stressful life, and threatening her with homelessness is a very low blow.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEDIT: forgot to add, what started this whole thing is this situation: my sister and her family know that they are not supposed to go to the second floor without permission (that's where my and my daughter's bedrooms are). Well my nephews started using this rule to hang out with their cousin without their mother being able to get to them, and when she does my daughter's door is usually locked so she has to wait for them to open it for her.\n\nShe is convinced that they are hiding something from her in my daughter's room. All they are doing is having some freedom and privacy away from her constant monitoring.", "created_utc": 1668878829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzh4mx/aita_for_telling_my_sister_to_either_lay_off_on/", "score": 1007, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has no right to tell you how to parent your child ever. You have been gracious enough letting her entire family move into your home and she is treating you like a child.

(although as a side bit since she's 14, I'd probably want to sit down with her and just explain a little whats going on just so she's at least somewhat aware that her aunt might try to dictate what she can/cant do & to come to you if your sister does try to, ect)", "NTA. Different kids require different things. My parents treated me the way you treat your daughter because I proved I could be trusted with that freedom. But they were much stricter with my older brother because he proved he could not be. Your sister isn't necessarily wrong for being stricter with her children, they may need a firmer hand than your daughter does. She is wrong to try to dictate how you should parent.", "NTA\n\nAs always, if you're not abusive or neglegtful, your parenting style is no one's business. No wonder your sister's kids are rebelling. It was bound to happen sooner or later.\n\nAlso, pocket money is used to teach your kids how to budget before their financial decisions have serious repercussions. Not giving your kids an allowance isn't strict, it's incredibly short sighted and stupid.", "NTA.  If/when she escalates is the moment she moves out.", "NTA. Your nephews see a wonderful healthy father daughter relationship and want the same. A teen who\u2019s respected by their parent, has freedom and agency. If this is causing trouble for your controlling sister and they\u2019re questioning her parenting style, that\u2019s actually a good thing.

That would be too much.", "Your parenting choices are not what is causing the problem. It's her strict parenting choices that are causing the problem.

But honestly, it was probably worth the strain on your relationship with your sister for her kids to be exposed to a more kid-responsible (aka less strict) parenting style.  Good job letting your daughter make her own choices--she will have a much easier transition into adulthood as a result.", "NTA you sound like a dream father. Her increased stressed at the comparisons is not because of the laxness, it's because it highlights how suffocating her strictness is. She can't accept how gracious and stress reducing it is to stay in your house and then turn around and try to parent you and your daughter. I hope she learns from your and your daughters dynamic", "NTA, and they are hiding something in your daughter's room. \n\nIndependence. \n\nIt'll find its way out soon enough; to your sister's dismay, her lack of trust and need for control are going to pay many dividends like this in the future.", "NTA your freeloading sister is a control freak.", "NTA As a relatively conservative parent, I\u2019m used to saying to my children \u2018that\u2019s what they do, this is how we do it\u2019.

As long as she continues to deserve the trust you've placed in her there's absolutely no reason to change a thing.", "NTA.\n\nShe's creating her own stress. She already could have been homeless but they get to live comfortably while a more permanent solution is found. It's exceedingly kind of you and frankly she should be doing everything she can to not impose herself on you. \n\nThat means trying to force you to adjust your successful parenting style. \n\nYou didn't just decide this without reflection on your daughter's actions... You likely had a conversation with her about her responsibilities and what you will and won't enforce as long as she contributes to the household. The way you talk, I'm sure they're are consequences to any kind of bad behavior, but it seems to be more treating her like a whole human and not just a child to scold. I know I'm reading into this quite a bit, it's just the tone you set talking about the rules you have for your daughter. \n\nThis is 14 years of trust built up, and 10 years of just the two of you. You sound like a great dad and she's going to have a great foundation for when she's ready to be out on her own.", "NTA. Your sister made her own decision (with her kids) that got her to where she is now. By comparison, your choices are making her look like a bad/unfair parent. You didn't do that.

Every kid and family is different. Sounds like your sister should move.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your sister wants all her kids to leave and never talk to her again as soon as possible. If that's not what she wants... it's probably what she's gonna get.", "NTA. You're not a \"lax parent\". What you're doing is giving your daughter healthy boundaries and reasonable rules in which she can flex her growing independence. I mean, you're on the path to raising...gasp...a fully functioning adult (the horror, I need my pearls to clutch). \n\nYour sister, well, I can see why her kids are rebelling. What is her dictatorial method of parenting teaching her kids? That she who holds the power makes the rules?  Mommy isn't going to be following them around for the rest of their life telling them what to eat and when to go to bed or arguing with college professors (let's hope not at least).\n\nIf sis doesn't like your rules and how you run your house, she is more than welcome to leave.", "NTA - We all need to keep our opinions to ourselves when it comes to parenting, unless the situation is abusive. That said, I will add that I do agree with your parenting style and think you are right that they should find a new place if staying with you is adding to her stress, or if she is stressing you out.\n\nHowever, your edit is important. Your kid is following your rules and her kids aren't following her rules.  Could there be a workable compromise? Maybe no locked door while the cousins are in the room? This way your daughter still has her autonomy and she can choose whether to allow them in or not.", "NTA. Your house, your rules, and telling other people how to parent their child (with rare exceptions like if there\u2019s abuse) is a total asshole move. If she doesn\u2019t respect the rules of your house she can leave.", "NTA but ARE are a damn good dad. As you said, you give your daughter these looser rules because you have built trust and she has shown you that she respects you and trusts you back. \n\nIf it were me? I would kick the sister out if she chose to make one more comment and rent out the basement. I\u2019d put the funds from the tenants into your daughters education fund.", "I am here to tell you emphatically that you are NTA. I was brought up very much the way you are bringing up your daughter, way back in the 60s and 70s. I heard from cousins and friends that their parents were certain that I would end up either a pregnant teen, or end up being raped, because I was allowed to wear the clothes I chose, negotiate my own curfews, go to parties, and most problematically, allowed to date the boys of my choice no matter what their race or ethnicity. But the jokes on them because out of all of the friends and cousins who's parents were so certain of my youthful downfall, I am the only one who followed their dream of going to college and studying instead of getting married practically straight out of high school. My friends and cousins always thought it was funny that their parents were so sure of my demise because they knew the reason that I was allowed so much freedom to make my own decisions was because my parents had confidence that I was making good choices...even when I negotiated 2:00am curfews. I was also very honest with them, even if they might not like my answers. When they wanted me home by 11:00pm (but I wanted a 12:00 curfew) on my first date I told them that I could just as easily have sex and get pregnant before 11:00pm if that was what they were worried about, but I couldn't hang out and talk with my date after the movie if I had to be home at 11. They just looked at each other and said \"well, you can't argue with that logic,\" and so I had negotiated my first curfew. They didn't try to be my best friends...they were still my parents, who set the limits and rules. But they did treat me as a whole, independent, intelligent and trustworthy human being, capable of making my own decisions, as long as they were reasonable.\n\nAs a result, I have always had a great relationship with my mom and dad (Dad is deceased now but we were very close while he was alive.)  I know that I am lucky... I learned my parenting styles through the positive influence of my parents, and how I feel about my own childhood. My parents weren't perfect, of course, but they did a damned good job.\n\nImo, it's good that you are able to look back at your own childhood and use those negative experiences to shape your own parenting style in contrast to that of your parents. It sounds like your sister is following in their footsteps and it's hard on her children the way it was hard on you.  Please don't let her bully you into becoming someone neither you nor your daughter want you to be. If you did that, you would become the a-hole.\n\nEDITED: fixed a big typo", "NTA. It was very generous of you to open your home to your sister and her family. It is way out of line to for her to be criticizing your parenting style.", "NTA\n\nMy parents allowed me a lot of the same freedoms you\u2019ve given your daughter. I was the \u2018best behaved\u2019 out of all my friendship group\u2026and we were all good to start with. Underage drinking? I was the sober one who herded them back to mine and cared for them. Dodgy tattoos? All except me. Wrong bus home and no idea where we were? Rang my dad to pick us up.\n\nYou\u2019re teaching your daughter respect is mutually earned.", "NTA\n\nYour sister absolutely overstepped.\n\nIs it stressful that her kids have their own opinion about her parenting and are in the process of rejecting it? \n\nYup.\n\nDoes that mean she can demand you change the rules for your daughter? Does her not having another housing option mean she gets to bully you about this?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you are free to leave\u201d is a completely reasonable statement.\n\nAnd jesus her poor kids. \n\nShe\u2019d probably be less stressed if she didn\u2019t constantly assume the worst of her own kids.", "NTA\n\nBut a compromise may be in order to keep the peace. No locking the door when the cousins are in the room, and parents must knock before entering.", "NTA.  i\u2019m sure your sister\u2019s more hands on parenting has been necessary with 3 kids, especially boys, or there would\u2019ve been chaos. \n\nshe does seem a little over the top but to each his own.  if she doesn\u2019t want her boys upstairs then it\u2019s her job to control them\n\ni doubt she\u2019ll give up their housing opportunity when all is said and done", "NTA: You sound like you and your daughter have a good relationship.

When I arrived to pick them up the parents told me \u2018they\u2019re locked in my daughters room at the moment, you can\u2019t go in until she wants to open the door. That\u2019s the rules for my daughter.\u2019 This situation has happened several times now, and I\u2019ve had to wait for his daughter to unlock the door on a couple of occasions. I am not comfortable with this and I don\u2019t know how I feel about another teenager or their parents restricting my access to my children, so I said something and there was an argument about it, they are refusing to give me prompt access to my children in their home, AITA?\u201d \n\nThe comments would be absolutely howling at the OP to call the cops if it happened again, because you can\u2019t keep a parent from their child. Right now, the comments don\u2019t like OPs sister because the young adult/teen audience of reddit doesn\u2019t like restrictive parenting. I get it, OPs sister sounds entirely too strict, but it\u2019s important to separate how you feel about someone\u2019s parenting style from the actual situation presented. In the actual situation presented, both parties need to come to a reasonable compromise so the kids can continue to see each other or they can just live harmoniously.", "Currently she is saving for a car.", "We were not given allowance while growing up, she says we turned out alright, so she is following what our parents did.\n\nAlso she says kids having kids makes it easier for them to sneak around.", "That\u2019s not OP.  That\u2019s her kid.  They are free to obey their mom by not going into the daughter\u2019s room or not locking the door.  They are blocking access against the rules, not OP.  The discipline, if needed which it is not, needs to come from the sister on her own kids.", ">her kids are not supposed to be behind locked doors. That\u2019s her rule that she is allowed to have.\n\nIf she doesn't like the fact that the OP allows his child to lock the door she needs to let her children know that they are not allowed to go up to their cousin's room.", "If waiting for a niece to open a locked door is too much, then the aunt needs to tell HER kids that they\u2019re not alowed to be on the second floor.", "Awwww! I wish her good luck. You are a good parent who knows what's best for your daughter. I bet she is proud to have a dad like you!", "Most kids I know who snuck around where those whose parents were extremely controlling the others never had a reason to sneak around. \nGood on you for giving your daughter privacy.", "I think your sister has that all backwards. Having no freedom or independence causes hurt and rebellious children, and unfortunately, that can lead to making poor choices, often just because they want to thumb their noses at their parents.", "I agree, but OP is effectively allowing the children to not follow the rules in his home and then telling his sister that she can\u2019t enforce them in his home either. That\u2019s not okay. Think of it this way. If you were atheist and you were raising your children without religion, and you sent them to stay over at a friends. The friends family tells them that in their home they have to act as though they believe in god. That\u2019s the rules for their kids so that\u2019s the rule that applies. Similarly, if you were raising your children as vegans and they went to a friends where the friends family said \u201cwe eat meat here so I refuse to offer vegan options or allow you to bring your own into this home.\u201d \n\nThese things would be inappropriate, and they are, because parents have a right to raise their children as they see fit (within reason of course) and when they visit another home the temporary guardian doesn\u2019t get to just throw up their hands and say \u201cwe don\u2019t do that here.\u201d They have an obligation to extend respect for the parents boundaries wherever possible. OP is not doing that by saying \u201cin my house the kids get to be locked wherever they want and you can\u2019t go in.\u201d They need to discuss a solution together or sister needs to not allow her children to visit her brothers home, which would obviously be unfortunate.", "There is another comment thread discussing that, but I don\u2019t disagree.", "Further down the thread I elaborated on this, I don\u2019t disagree. If it were my sister though? I would be willing to look for a compromise because I would want the cousins to be able to spend time together. OP can be super rigid about not enforcing his sister\u2019s rules in his half of the home, and his sister can ban her children from that half. Who wins there though exactly? No one, and the biggest loser is the cousins who see each other much less. Not the solution I would pursue personally.", "Yes they do have that right in their home (ie: a vegan not allowing a meateater a burger or a christian not allowing a kid to pray to satan).  As a parent, I have the right to refuse my kids to go over to that house since I deem that an inappropriate place for my kids.  The sister can say, okay.  Then you aren\u2019t allowed upstairs anymore, or she can find her own housing where she has full control.", "That is the wrong take. \n\nThe OP is telling his sister that locked doors are allowed on the second floor of his house. \n\nThe sister can choose to let her kids go there or not. That is HER parenting decision. Note how the brother is imposing zero of his rules in the basement where his sister stays? That would be the equivalent to the vegetarian/meat example you gave. \n\nIt\u2019s insane that the aunt thinks she should be able to change her brother\u2019s parenting rules for his daughter.", "Yes, I agree completely, but I think a discussion would be better since they share a home and obviously I assume both parties want their kids to have contact since they\u2019re cousins and likely friends. This is why many parents are willing to be flexible, by offering vegan options or allowing children of different belief systems into their homes or enforcing rules that parents of a child are more comfortable with. How much time would kids actually get to spend with their friends if every single parent just outright refused to be even remotely flexible for the comfort of the other child\u2019s parent? That\u2019s a bit ridiculous tbh, and would really limit kids friendships. OP and his sister could do that, but it would be a shame for the kids.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProtect your kid.", "NTA.

Your daughter is actively helping her cousins circumvent them and you defend her when she does. That's not okay. That's exactly the same as if your daughter was visiting a friend's house and you told them your daughter isn't allowed to go out after 9 but they allow there own child to stay out till 12  so they ignore the fact your daughter doesn't return till 12 because it's not there rule and your daughter started staying over there house to avoid your curfew.\n\nYour sisters kids have rules. Your daughter should not be allowed to help her cousins circumvent them. Your sister should not insist your daughter follow her rules. Tell your daughter she cannot assist her cousins in defying their mothers rules. Simple.", "THIS  RIGHT HERE. OP's parenting style sounds right on point and its working well for his daughter. Sis needs to understand that he will not and should not change his way of parenting just for her to feel less stress. That's 100% not a valid reason; its not like his daughter is running around doing drugs or something. She has her options, either put up with a bit of stress due to their different parenting styles or be homeless...and that'd be WAY more stressful...NTA", "Reducing her stress is easy, all she needs to do is quit trying to control every single aspect of her kids lives.", "I bet the 16 year old is going to move in with OP the second he turns 18", "THIS - Sis is setting up the same dynamics with her kids as she and OP likely had with their parents. AND while she may be ok with that, OP most decidedly isn't. HE's raising his daughter in a healthy way and she has zero business inserting herself for no good reason. NTA", "NTA. Your parenting choices are not what is causing the problem. It's her strict parenting choices that are causing the problem. People can't conform thier life to avoid showing her kids that other prople live differently.", "Correction: OP's daughter is already living an adult life, successfully.\n\nOP you should be super proud of what you have done.  Don't change a thing.", ">miles between prison warden and parent\n\nlmaoo", "It's his daughters room. She doesn't need to let her controlling aunt to invade her privacy.", ">he needs to respect her choices\n\nAs she needs to respect his. If she doesn't do that she is free to go. Thats why he warned her about kicking them out if she continues it. It's normal boundary.\n\n>Perhaps they need to sit down and have a civil discussion without the kids to set clear parenting boundaries and include BIL at the table.\n\nWould be actually a good idea to give her sons some rest but I really doubt it would work anyhow. She is borderline controlling person and I doubt that she would take any their words into consideration. Also I don't think that BiL has any problem with her parenting style as he allowed her to treat her kids like a prisoners for many years.", "OP sounds like amazing parent, he's going to have a great relationship with his daughter while sister will probably have a strained one when her boys grow up, probably like OP does with his parents. Generational trauma sucks and anybody who breaks it is a hero to me.", "Depending on where they live he might can move in before that", "I do have some sympathy for her. She has 3 teenage boys. Boys.  Omg. Can you imagine the testosterone, the fighting, the arguing. \n\nA friend has 5 boys. They ran their house like an army boot camp. She was teatotal because she suspected if she started drinking she wouldn't stop. Now all the boys are adult. They turned out fine and they love their mother. They like to get together and reminisce about how many times they nearly killed each other.\n\nSo she shouldn't be critical of your style,  but i can see why she she is struggling. Maybe they could have it explained to them? One lovely well behaved daughter does not equal 3 teenage boys.", "Ha. Good girl. Sounds like you\u2019re doing a great job. NTA. \n\nYour sister\u2019s kids are gonna hate her one day for being so damn controlling. The extent to which she pushes it is bizarre.", "Brilliant. Obviously your parenting methods work extremely well for your daughter. \n\nKids need to be able to exercise decision-making power as part of brain growth. If you try to stop them, they'll just exercise it in ways you don't like. Your method of stair-stepped decision making power as her capabilities increase means she doesn't need to rebel to get what she needs to learn and grow, unlike her cousins' situation. \n\nI really like the dinner approach -- she needs to either budget her opt-outs to twice a week or plan ahead so she knows what she's going to make for dinner and make sure the ingredients are there. It's a good exercise in balancing short-term gratification against planning for contingencies and future desires, yet the stakes are very low, so if she winds up making choices she hates, the only consequence is a bit of frustration.", "NTA. She can go be stressed about your parenting at a hotel with her family.\nYou are an AWESOME dad and she is being an entitled, ungrateful and inconsiderate AH.", "NTA congratulations on being the best dad for your daughter you say she has earned your trust, you have also earned her trust too she will always look up to you and will definitely go to to when she needs help too it\u2019s really good to see a good parent on these posts", "So smart!!!", "You raised her well.", "Boo-yah! Your daughter sounds awesome. Mine is 9 and has a strong sense of self too. Very cool kids.", "You might also want to help her start a Roth IRA with Vanguard or a similar low cost investment company. She can put some money in it and can withdraw the principal without any penalties as long as she doesn't touch the interest. That money will be grow so much by the time she retires!", "Assuming all three of her sons don't wind up going completely NC with her, that is.", "One of five girls here. Believe me when I say teenage girls are not a walk in the park.", "Another terrible consequence for kids of strict parenting is they kids often don't learn any self-control or internal motivation. They're used to being forced to do things. They can't make themselves do something. They get no pleasure from a job well-done, and no perspective about how to learn from mistakes. Once you remove the parent, the child has no incentive to do anything. If you don't give a kid age-appropriate autonomy, you'll be left with (in the best case scenario) a puppet. Without a hand manipulating it, it's just a pile of cloth.", "I love your comment. Thank you.", "NC definitely goes hand in hand with strained relationships, I'd bet vital organs at least one of three does.", "Well basically you just destroy the childs ability to make a decision. They often end up going completely off the rails in college.\n\nWhen I moved away it was a minimal adjustment, I lived pretty independently since I was 16 (with my parents there for support and guidance) after this point I didn't really need permission to do anything (though they could still tell me something was a terrible idea and I shouldn't do it).\n\nOnce I hit 18 and went to college I wasn't the best cook but other than that did pretty well. Some of the kids who were kept on a tight leash had no idea how to balance studying, socializing and partying nor any idea how to drink (somewhat) responsibly.", "Children of strict parents learn how to lie really well because that\u2019s the best survival skill.", "Good luck to her on saving for a vehicle. Hopefully your sister never finds out that your daughter has money and an allowance otherwise she might blow a gasket and a blood vessel. In truth every kid is different when it comes to raising kids. You definitely are NTA", "You turned out alright. I have doubts about your sister.", "You're NTA and sound like a great dad, but I feel a little bad for your sister, as she grew up in the same crappy environment as yoh and internalized it in a way that perpetuates this harmful cycle, rather than ending it like you did.", "Then she can move fcking out then not her house his house his rules", "A locked door is not a child being blocked from a parent. You\u2019re going to do a wonderful job alienating your own kids if you actually believe children shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have any sense of privacy.", "This is I imagine why so many preachers' kids go so wild. They're used to being told everything, so when they're suddenly put into a position of making their own decisions there's no lens through which they can see good and bad ideas because the person making all those calls isn't there.", "That, too. I had really strict parents. My oldest brother used to have me intercept the mail with parking or drinking citations when he was at college. My middle brother once had difficulty at the hospital because he couldn't explain how he broke his collarbone running cross country. (Hint: he was playing flag football with friends, which for some reason wasn't allowed.) We had an underground barter system at the dinner table because we had to eat everything on our plates and we'd secretly trade the foods we hated. I was lucky that I'm pretty introverted, so I didn't feel the need to rebel in the traditional sense. I just committed a lot of thoughtcrimes, lol.", "Not only that, her is teaching his daughter to know what is best for herself.  A lesson that many parents miss the mark on.", "I don\u2019t think I told my parents the entire truth about anything starting when I was about 8-10 years old. Better to beg forgiveness than to ask permission. Never had what I\u2019d call a close relationship with either of my parents as an adult.\n\nThankfully, I grew up in the 80s and 90s, so they couldn\u2019t track me or anything.", "Nail on the head!", "Once again, giving someone a place to stay does not give you the right to control how they parent their children or restrict their access to their children in any way. That\u2019s not a dig at OP, it\u2019s just the truth. Her parenting may be controversial, and I\u2019m not fond of it myself, but you shouldn\u2019t offer someone a place to stay if your motive is to have a say in how they raise their children, it doesn\u2019t really work like that. No matter where you live you still have a right to raise your children how you would prefer.", "He isn\u2019t telling her how to control her kids it\u2019s her that\u2019s tell him how to control his", "I believe you mean she squats in OP's home. Sharing would imply that there's other reasons she's living there besides OP's good graces. She's free to parent her kids however she wants, but as soon as she tries to dictate what happens under OP's roof she can either stfu or move out and quit being a bum.", "They don\u2019t share a home he is allowing them to stay until they get their house sorted", "They don't share a home. She lives there rent free. If she doesn't like it she can leave. She does not need to be acomodated at the cost of changing OP's daughter's life.", "Giving someone a place to stay does not mean you can bar access to their children or tell them how to parent their children. It goes both ways.", "Yes, he is currently sharing his own with his sister and her children. Do you prefer that phrasing? It doesn\u2019t really matter where a parent lives, they still have the right to raise their children how they want to. You don\u2019t get to control how someone parents just because you\u2019re kind enough to give them a place to stay.", "See comment:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzh4mx/aita_for_telling_my_sister_to_either_lay_off_on/ix0kfzr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3"]}
