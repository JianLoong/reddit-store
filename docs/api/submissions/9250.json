On the invite it specified \u201cCousin requests no children because she wants to spend the day with just the ladies\u201d. I am the only family member currently with children and she is the first in her friend group to have a child. Even though I was essentially singled out, I put my feelings aside and honored her request without making a fuss. It is her day and she\u2019s allowed to invite who she wants.  Before invites went out I was made aware of a shower being planned and mentally planned on taking my daughter, F5 and leaving her sister (F2) with my husband. My daughter is very close to my cousin, has shown up for my cousin on her recent milestones ie was her flower girl, attending housewarming party and gender reveal. My daughter has been to several baby showers for my husband\u2019s side of the family so she\u2019s been asking if cousin is having one. I told her yes but WE couldn\u2019t go and left it at that. Let me be clear, I\u2019m not not going out of spite because my daughter can\u2019t go. I\u2019m not going because it would crush my daughter if she found out I went without her. Obviously, I know kids don\u2019t have to go everywhere and she\u2019s been made aware of this many times when I\u2019ve had a girls night or moms day out. But since my daughter has been to baby showers and is close to my cousin I just don\u2019t feel good about leaving her out and crushing her. My daughter and I have been looking at the registry to send a gift and I plan on calling her the day of. When I RSVP\u2019d no, I just said I couldn\u2019t make it and I hope everyone has so much fun.

You have the right to decline, as you feel that this may hurt your daughter. Why are your mom and grandmom stirring the pot?", "nah. you said it already you're respecting your cousin's wishes by not bringing any children to her baby shower and she has every right to make that rule. you made a decision by deciding you did not want to go without your daughter. that's  your right and you have every right to decide that.", "YTA. Instead of talking to daughter and explaining that sometimes events are just for adults, just as others are just for children, your skipping it altogether?? Your daughter is 5, she will occasionally be disappointed in life, and she will survive and be fine.", "Invitations aren't summons, so NTA for not going. I do think its silly to expect a 5 year old to be welcome at adult women functions but no is a complete sentence so you don't owe any explanation for declining. You did fuck up when you whined/complained/lamented the snub of you and your daughter at the event, because once you let it be known why you're not attending to anyone, like apparently your blabbering mom, everyone will know and it looks petty. Its better left unsaid.", "Nobody here is an asshole. But I think it\u2019s healthy to have boundaries with your kids and attend things without them.", "YTA your daughter is 5 and that is a pitiful excuse for you to not go. It definitely comes over as you're not going because she hurt your feelings by saying no kids...which is perfectly valid for a shower.", "INFO: I'm not an expert, by any means on baby showers, but there's certainly been a few in my vicinity (sister, cousins, female coworkers). I've never heard of kids younger than maybe teenagers being invited to them. Is that common?", "I dont know why you couldn't tell your kid that your cousin is having a girls night out/moms' day out instead of a normal shower which she could have gone to... because that IS what's happening!?\n\nAlso at 5 I'd expect them to get over it fairly easily; if they're very sensitive then maybe have the other parent take them out while you're at the shower and at least they'll have had a fun activity during the day so they don't get jealous that you got to go to a thing and they didn't (though honestly this shouldn't always need to be done, they can and should learn to understand they cant go to everything, anyway).", "OP asks for judgement then argues with everyone who says she's TA", "NTA for not going, but the bit about being 'singled out' is ridiculous. She didn't say \"kids welcome except for OP's kid\". She said no kids. That means nobody who is looking after a partner's kid, a nibling, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: You seem to be taking it REALLY PERSONALLY that she wants no kids there from your comments. It's not that she doesn't specifically want YOUR kid there. She wants an atmosphere where people can talk without having to worry about a kid overhearing and being traumatized by the 'joys of childbirth', possibly, or something else mature.", "YTA Your cousin decided to have an adults-only event and, because you felt singled out, you made up an excuse why you could not go, talked bad about your cousin behind her back, and felt righteous in the process.\n\nIf this was actually about your daughters feelings, you could have simply called your cousin and asked if you three could do something at a different time together so F5 could celebrate with her too.", "Yep, YTA. Two reasons. 1) Your daughter is 5. You can easily figure out how to attend without her knowing and it\u2019s actually not at all weird to tell her that the event is adults only. You\u2019re worried about her feelings, when in actuality you could have made it no big deal and she could have learned how to deal with these feelings (which will happen several times in her childhood). I\u2019m glad you know that the cousin is allowed to invite who she wants. Stop teaching your daughter to be entitled. No one has to be included 100% of the time. \n\n2) When you told your mom (or anyone else) why you really weren\u2019t going, you already allowed it to \u201cget out\u201d. You left it up to them to keep your secret. We all know that if you want to keep something secret, you don\u2019t tell a soul. If you wanted everyone to be in the dark, you should have kept them in the dark. Instead, you missed the opportunity to maintain your own integrity on this decision.", "NTA. Asshole behavior would be making a fuss, showing up with your daughter, or generally being a jerk. You honored the invitation\u2019s restrictions and chose not to go. I don\u2019t see asshole in that.", "Nah.   That said, teaching our kids to deal with disappointment is a valuable life lesson.  I doubt your daughter is going to need therapy as an adult because she wasn\u2019t invited to a baby shower when she was five.", "People that ban kids from their events should just expect some parents to not show up. I've been using my kids as an excuse to not go to kid free weddings for years now.", "NTA - It's an invite with stipulations that apply to you. You chose not to attend. There is nothing beyond this. You honored the invite. Adults should know restrictions can cause unexpected outcomes. I respect you assessed your young daughter would crushed to hear you attended so you engaged her in selecting the gift.  Enjoy a mom/daughter(s) day.", "YTA...you could have handled this with honesty all around.\n\nAsk your cousin about it. I doubt it was you being singled out, it might be that she wanted to enjoy adult time only. Or maybe she did but only because she knows how special her relationship is with your daughter and was worried she wouldn't get a break. That adult only time is about to be very limited for her. \n\nTell your daughter it's just an adult day, but you and her can take your cousin and do something special another day.", "NTA - you're not making a fuss about it, you just don't want to go and that's your call for whatever reason. \n\nYour mother and grandmother, however. OMG. Leave well enough alone, people.", "YTA. This is a great opportunity to teach your daughter a lesson and you\u2019re about to miss it. It\u2019s an unfortunate part of life that sometimes we don\u2019t get what we want. You can teach your daughter how to handle her disappointment and find a different way to have fun with her. \n\nYour cousin is not singling you out, she\u2019s making a decision for how she wants to host her own party. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you or your daughter.", "NTA: invite,  declined, end. Telling your mom is the ah part. No one needs to know your why. If they ask: I know, I'm so disappointed I can't go that day too. We have plans we just can't get out of. Then send a gift with a lovely note about how excited you are to meet baby. End.", "NTA, you received an invitation, it is in no way legally obligating you to attend, if you chose not to attend that is your choice. If the hostess is going be such a witch because you are not going to attend I personally would reconsider sending a gift. But then again I am petty like that.", "YTA for snitching to your mom and grandmom about it. Other than that, I can understand your kid to not want to feel hurt, but sometimes parties are adults only for a reason? You say your daughter was a flower girl at the wedding, but was she invited to the Bachelorette party? Would have been better to talk it out with your cousin instead of going behind her back.", "YTA for sharing your reasons for declining.  That always gets back to the host & everyone knows it.  I also agree you are a bit over the top in your perspective of the situation, but that would be fine if you'd have kept you mouth shut.", "NTA. It all boils down to the same old point:\n\nPeople are allowed to have child free events AND people are allowed to not attend child free events.\n\nThere are lots of reasons to not attend a child free event. But the reasons don't matter. Cousin is allowed to have one and you are allowed not to go.", "NTA but pretty petty. Your daughter is 5, staying home is not going to cause her permanent emotional or mental damage, I highly doubt she\u2019ll even remember being excluded in 6 months time. I think you\u2019re making it a bigger deal because you feel slighted", "NTA . With the amount of times I've seen the same old story about \"X wants to bring kids to non-kid function\" and everybody screeching they should just stay home if they don't want to leave their kid, these Y T A votes are weird. Its an invitation, not an obligation, meaning you can reject it if you wish.", "YTA \n\nYour 5 year old will not be crushed. Send her to a fun day with her 2 year old sibling!", "I don\u2019t think you are TA but you def just be honest with your daughter she will be fine and it\u2019s good for her to understand as a kid she will\nNot be at all the events", "NAH.  She has the right to not invite children, and you have the right not to go because of your child.  \n\nYou did not give your cousin a hard time about her decision, nor did you talk smack about her behind her back.  You respectfully declined.  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA \n\nAs a \u201ckids are always invited family\u201d that merged with a \u201cno kids invited family\u201d I get this struggle! My daughter gets upset sometimes too and I skipped a few kid free things when she was younger.", "NTA.  The Reddit invitation rule for all events is that the host can invite who ever they want and exclude whomever they want, the invitees can decline for any reason, and the chips will fall where they may.  You are merely one invited guest.  It\u2019s not a summons.  You are not obligated or required to attend.  You are not required to give a reason for not attending, but nobody can attack you if you choose to share why.  You met all requirements.  You courteously replied.  You even went further and got a gift.   Your family are a bunch of a-holes for complaining that you are choosing to exercise your independence and control over self to graciously not attend.  Nobody can demand your attendance or reasonably criticize.", "NTA \n\nYour mom and grandma kinda are though for causing drama", "[deleted]", "YTA, a lot of times these things are for the grown ups, especially in this situation where only one of the guests has a kid. I have a kid and have been in your position and obviously my partner went without our kid. Your behavior seems a little entitled here.", "YTA", "NAH. There is absolutely nothing wrong with your decision and don\u2019t listen to otherwise. You can choose what you want to do for whatever reason it is. I would have done the same because I wouldn\u2019t want to hurt my child\u2019s feeling.", "YTA - I think it's perfectly fine to stay home if you don't feel like explaining this to your daughter. It's not the route I would have chosen, and I think you're blowing this way out of proportion, but that's absolutely your right. You also responded to the RSVP, are picking out a gift, and are not asking your cousin to do any changes to her venue. So far, I may have done things differently, but to each their own.\n\nNow here's where YTA. You told your Mom about it, even though you know that your Mom can sometimes be a bit off (*see your reply in another comment*). You should have owned your decision and kept the details to yourself. \n\nSurely you know the family you have, and how quickly comments can spread. Also, you've now put out in the world the actual reason, which your daughter may now hear about through any number of sources at the next family gathering. You're going to miss out on the shower, **and** going to disappoint your daughter in a delayed fashion when she hears about it eventually. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would start reaching out to my cousin and make it clear that you have no intentions of her changing her plans, and that you hope she'll have a great day. You want her to know that there is no pressure or expected outcome on your part, and that you're totally fine with her setup.\n\nGoing to add that having children in baby showers isn't something I've seen before, and I've typically seen them as rather child-free.", "YTA: your kid probably wouldn\u2019t be that hurt, your projecting because you want your way. Child free events are okay and it\u2019s also okay to leave your child at home to attend them. It\u2019s not okay to whine because you can\u2019t bring your kid. I don\u2019t get why your 5 yr olds feelings about a baby shower would be that strong about not getting to attend.  You didn\u2019t even have to bring it up to her and you probably brought up in a way that you knew would upset her so you would have excuse to throw a tantrum.  As someone who has attended many events without a conversation with my kids, it\u2019s amazing how much they don\u2019t care, I better go make sure my 19 yr old son doesn\u2019t feel left out because I didn\u2019t take him to any of the events he wasn\u2019t invited to in his lifetime\u2026", "YTA\n\nSometimes certain events are child free. It doesn't matter if your child has attended other people's similar events.", "NTA", "NTA", "NAH except your mom and gma", "YTA. It\u2019s ok for you to do things without your kids. Not everything is about your kid.", "YTA \n\nYou aren\u2019t planning or paying for the shower.  The invitation is clear and this cousin has asked, and explained why, the event is not including children.  \n\nIf you aren\u2019t paying for the party, the guest of honour or the host, then you don\u2019t get to dictate or demand who is on the guest list.    Period.   No person on earth gets invited to everything everywhere.   Your child (and you) should recognize that other people get to make choices that you don\u2019t agree with.  Not going at all because your child was excluded from the invitation shows your child that petty is a normal and appropriate response when you are disrespecting the wishes of those in charge of planning/paying for the party.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hands down. You are missing an important event because your 5 year old isn't invited. If you are unable to let your daughter experience such a minor disapointment then good luck to her. What happens when she doesn't get invited to a sleepover? Doesn't make the team? Are you going to be the mom who is constantly trying to be a \"fixer\".

Children that young can feel betrayed when someone who they are close with does not want them around and can feel rejected. Feeling rejected by someone who you love and who loves you is a very stong negative emotion even for adults. It is made worse that she would have been the only child attending and OP would be the only attendee with a child, effectively saying she does not want daughter there specifically. OP does not want to lie to her child since lies get found out. She does not want to hide it from her child, likely because children are not stupid and when the baby arrives daughter will know the shower already happened and would wonder why they did not go.
