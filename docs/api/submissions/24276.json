I have some sets of fine china that I like to switch out between the seasons that I've inherited from my grandmother. When we have our get togethers I serve dinner on these plates. My MIL compliments them everytime. My Sister-In-Law, however, has made comments to me that \"they're not her style.\" I honestly didn't think twice her comment about it until this past february when one of my plates was put in the sink, broken. Chalked it up to an accident.\n\n\r  \nIn April we had another dinner. This time SIL was carrying both her and her boyfriends plates to the sink, & accidentally dropped both. Again, no biggie at all. In May she broke two more plates & in June she broke a plate and a cup. At this point I was catching on.  I brought up these concerns to my husband and he brushed it off as accidents. I told my mom and she said she thought my SIL was doing it on purpose & got me a camera to put in my dining room.\r  \n\r  \nIn July we had dinner, and I had an opportunity arise. My MIL, SIL and her bf joined us for dinner. While our plates were still ON THE TABLE my MIL asked how my plants were doing and I said I'd show her! I told my husband to follow us outside so he could show her the plant he's growing, leaving SIL alone with her bf. When we came back inside 5 mins later, her plate was broken.  When they left, I pulled up the camera footage. I saw her stand up when we walked out and peek around the corner, and then throw the plate on the ground. I kept this video to myself.\r\r  \n\r  \nThat brings me to this past weekend, we had our family dinner and we were joined by My in-laws, SIL & her bf as well as my parents, siblings & niece. I served everyone, saving evil SIL for last. I brought her food out on a child's plate with a sippy cup and got those kid's silverware with the plastic handles. She looked at me confused and said \"I think you mixed my plate up with your niece's plate\" and I said \"No, niece's name is responsible enough to eat on a grown up's plate. If you're going to act like a child in my home, I'm going to treat you like a child in my home.\" She tried to play coy but I had my ipad ready and played the video to everyone at the table. She started sobbing, swiped the kids plate off the table and stormed out. My in-Laws both apologized and offered to pay for replacement plates but I told them not to worry about it. Despite this we still had a nice time.\r  \n\r  \nWhen everyone left my husband told me I was out of line and cruel, but I told him that this has been happening for months & I've told him it was bothering me multiple times. It's Wednesday, he's still being a little cold to me and I also got a text from my S-I-L's boyfriend asking me if I would apologize to her because \"I really embarrassed her.\" I sent him the video again and he left me on read. My husband just called me to ask if I was taunting her boyfriend because his sister called him crying that I was.

Your husband and your SIL\u2019s boyfriend are assholes though. You inherited those from your grandmother. SIL has something seriously wrong with her mentally. Who breaks someone else\u2019s plates just because they aren\u2019t her style? Who cares about someone else\u2019s plates? It\u2019s a goddamn plate and it\u2019s not her house. She\u2019s behaving like a child, she deserves to be treated like one and called out. What a psycho. Does she display any other type of aggressive behaviours to you? She sounds jealous and is throwing a tantrum like a toddler.", "NTA\n\nYou're amazing.  You have nothing to apologize for.  Your SIL does have lots of things to apologize for though.", "NTA and I don't get why your husband is not with you on this! Those plates had sentiment value, you've been noticing it for a long time and talked to him multiple times. He brushed you off! You even have a proof your SIL does it on purpose. MULTIPLE TIMES, should I say AGAIN. And he still sides with that immature child, who couldn't ask you for a change of plates if it bothered her so much.\n\nYou don't owe her any apologies, but you should have a proper convo with your hubby to get his attitude straight", "Just curious.. why is your husband still defending her? Her own parents aren\u2019t on her side. You\u2019re supposed to be a team, and your husband is not acting the part. Nta, but your husband is", "NTA, so NTA.  Your SIL caused the embarrassing circumstance she found herself in.  Has she even bothered to explain why she was breaking your plates? \"Not my style\"  is just not good enough; more like she was jealous of your dishes and what they meant to you.", "NTA\n\nExcuse me! You dropped your crown. Well played \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nBut I don\u2019t understand is to why you must apologize when your SIL is deliberately damaging your property and doing it behind your back? By your husband? Don\u2019t invite SIL and her BF anymore since she\u2019s uncivilized.", "NTA. Your SIL's behavior would be wildly inappropriate from a child, let alone from a 30 year old women. You can't just go around breaking people's stuff because it's not to your taste. It's petty and malicious, not to mention illegal.\n\nShe clearly understands that, or she wouldn't be so embarrassed by you exposing it to the rest of the family. You didn't embarrassed her, she embarrassed herself.", "NTA. Another example of 'play stupid games, win stupid prizes.' She was acting like a child, so you literally treated her like one. Brava.", "NTA. What kind of sociopath breaks SOMEONE ELSE\u2019S dinnerware because they\u2019re not their style. She deserves that embarrassment. Did she ever apologize for breaking so many of your plates?", "NTA.  She is deliberately breaking treasured keepsakes from your grandmother.  You should have tied a bib around her chin as well. And you have a husband problem.", "NTA.  And what the hell is wrong with your husband???", "NTA, but your SIL is and so are your husband and her bf for trying to fault you.", "NTA. The only person who embarrassed her is herself. If she didn\u2019t like the plates, that\u2019s fine. But her deliberately BREAKING the plates and such over and over again is terrible. Your SIL sounds super immature. Also your husband sucks. He dismissed his sister breaking the plates over and over and then said YOU were the AH. All you were doing is telling her that you knew what she was doing and exposed her so maybe other family members know not to give her nice plates. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t invite her, her boyfriend or your husband to anymore dinners. Husband can get his own dinner if he\u2019s gonna take the side of his mentally deranged sister and boyfriend", "NTA. She deserved worst for intentionally destroying the irreplaceable plates you got from your gran.", " I applaud you. Why doesn't your husband have your back? Sister has been a jerk purposely breaking your things. Does husband not like them either? NTA and SIL needs to grow up to get an adult plate.", "NTA \n\nShe is lucky you gave her anything to eat off at all", "Her behaviour was malicious. She hasn\u2019t apologized but is playing the victim.  She should not be allowed in your home, until she can apologize and replace the items she broke. Even then it would be a no go for me. Who knows what else she\u2019d do? Maybe stick your toothbrush in the toilet.", "\ud83d\ude02 I love this so much. Perfect way to make your point. I couldn\u2019t have come up with something better myself. NTA at all and your SIL sucks.", "JAM (Justified Asshole Move, Make it a thing!)", "NTA. I think you took a stand and put her in her place and have nothing to apologize for. If she wants to act like a child, then she'll be treated like one. Husband is looking out for his sister, I get it, but you're his wife. You trump sister in this case. Your husband should have a talk with SIL about her behavior and make her apologize to you. SIL bf is probably tired of dealing with sobbing gf, which is not your problem. Good for you!!", "NTA. You really should take the inlaws up on their offer to replace the plates though. \n\nI wonder why your husband is taking his sister's side on this though, that's really odd.", "She embarrassed herself. NTA. I love that in response to the bf you just sent the video again ahahaha I love it. Yes would love to hear what your husband would suggest here since he wasn\u2019t remotely helpful in resolving this or believing you", "NTA. Total FAFO moment. She got what she deserved and that was amazing how you showed everyone her true reflection since it was seeming to get swept under the rug. Glad the M/FIL have your back in this hopefully, you can get DH on your side too instead of him being her enabler. You can have a soft spot for people who get a dealt an unfortunate hand but it leads to bratty behavior if that soft spot is kept there for those who are in situations of thier own doing. \n\nShe can stay embarrassed or she can act properly and behave herself if she wants to move past this. I'd sit DH down and ask him why he's fine with an adult woman having the behavior of someone about a quarter of her age or less. Then ask if he'd be okay with other 32 YO pulling that stunt with his sentimental items using the same excuses he does to justify her behavior. \n\nSometimes pulling people out of the small part of the picture they're focused on and having them look at the picture in full can snap them back into a more understanding perspective. \n\nP.S. OP you rock!!!", "NTA. Your SIL is a childish little bee-yatch. \n\nOh, I wish you had a video of her reaction to share.", "Your SIL is an asshole and worse than a child but your husband is telling you he doesn't have your back. That's your problem.\n\nNTA", "His sister (not the other in laws) should be paying to replace your plates. There is a lovely website you can do this from. I did when I discovered some of my parents old silverware was breaking (bad ebony handles).\n\nNTA, you are being nicer than I would be. Especially with how expensive some of that can be.", "NTA \n\nShe SHOULD be embarrassed!\n\nHowever, you probably should have shown your husband the video and made him take care of it (to YOUR satisfaction) as it is his family.\n\nYour Mom is super clever and I would not want to be on her bad side.", "NTA. Your SIL has some ridiculous angst over dishes she eats on for maybe 30 minutes once a month.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop letting SIL enter your home.", "NTA - YOUR dishes don't suit her taste so she breaks them while you are feeding her in your home?? Absolutely outrageous, she would never be invited back to my home after breaking grandma's china. She fucked around and found out.", "NTA and I'd have gone a step beyond even serving her at all and put her out of my house.", "Gosh no, you are certainly NTA. What a nasty piece of work this SIL is. Hopefully she won\u2019t come round for meals again. She needs to apologise profusely to you as well as turn up with the nicest set of dining plates available in the shop. Those having a go at you don\u2019t deserve you.", "NTA I also have heirloom china and would be beyond upset if this happened to me.  I wonder how your husband would feel if one of your family members destroyed something he loved on purpose. I'd let your in-laws replace the dishes, it will make them feel better, I'm sure they're mortified by her behavior.", "NTA. She set out to be cruel to you by destroying things you loved out of sheer malice and envy. She deserves the consequences of her actions.\n\nShe will hate you forever after this, but it sounds like she was well on her way there already.", "NTA.  She and her boyfriend sound like they are on something from your other comments.", "NTA\n\nI would kill for a woman as badass as you in my life. Keep being glorious lol", "Okay stupid games, win stupid prizes. And her game wasn't just stupid, it was cruel.", "hey r we you be you to you so  5\u2022 have, \"", "But like WHY did she do it?! I mean it's frickin plates! I guess ESH because it's just a bit of A and passive aggressive way of handling it rather than talking to her assertively, but what she did is obviously worse.\n\nBut I just have to know... why??", "NTA but in a good marriage, communication is key. You should have discussed it with the husband first.\n\nEdit: I thought she didn\u2019t talk to her husband about it. I skimmed that paragraph.", "your an asshole, you should have been civilized and just ask/demans that she no longer come over to your house, instead of inviting her over with the intention of embarrassing her.", "ESH\n\nSIL sucks for obvious reasons (what a bizarre thing to be doing).\n\nYour actions, while hilarious and probably really cathartic, were also immature.\n\nAt minimum you should have talked this over with your husband first, because this affects his relationships too and he probably has a better idea WTF is going on with his crazy sister.  Together you two should have figured out a better plan.\n\nDid SIL deserve this humiliation?  Maybe yeah.  But was it *productive* to humiliate her?  Probably not.  I'd expect this to come back to haunt you, because like it or not she's going to be at least tangentially a part of your life for the long haul.\n\nYou could have approached her in private and with empathy (whether she deserves it or not) to figure out why the hell she's acting out like this.  If that's too much, you could have served everyone on non-breakable dishes.", "ESH. \n\nFirstly, what is WRONG with your sister and why is everyone enabling her??? I can completely understand why you\u2019re upset. What she did is horrible and inexcusable. However, while she\u2019s certainly the much, much bigger asshole in this situation, you could have talked to her about it directly instead of resorting to a passive-aggressive display. Being unproblematic is an important way to protect yourself moving forward, as it won\u2019t give others ammo to deflect blame onto you for a situation that is clearly not your fault. \n\nI\u2019m so, so sorry she did this to you, that your husband isn\u2019t being supportive, and that your SIL\u2019s boyfriend is stirring up additional drama. You really don\u2019t deserve this and I truly sympathize with you.  \n\nWishing you the best of luck dealing with this situation!", "YTA. The springing it on her was a step too far. You already had proof, you wanted humiliation. \n\nThat said, there are times to be an AH, meaning that you choose both to go to an unnecessary step and that you'll own the fallout. I think that's the case here. Own the impression that if someone f's with you, you'll get full on humiliating revenge. I'd own being an AH here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have the patience of Job and did a great job of pointing out how much better behaved the other children at the table were. haha Do not give in. Even her parents were embarrassed.

She cannot replace those memories with stuff from a thrift shop.", "I would never allow her in my house again. Y are definitely not the asshole.", "We were totally fine before this. We've never been like super close but close enough to grab a coffee and get our nails done together. I've been married into the family now for 6 years and I love my in-laws.

Maybe it's her husband who really hates the plates and his sister was just doing him a favour :/ \n\nI hope not, but it would make sense of the husband's behaviour in dismissing her concerns then defending his sister. And it would make more sense of the sister's fucking weird behaviour.", "Just speculation because husband is still giving me the cold shoulder, it's probably because that's his younger sister and she has been in and out of (albeit self-caused) trouble these past few months.

Again I'm guessing but I think they're getting a thrill or something out of all of it.", "There is no possible explanation. I mean, I\u2019m sure it would be amusing to hear her to try spin some BS.", "This \"not to her taste\" stuff has to be complete BS.

She knew my grandmother and I were close. Part of me thinks it may have something to do with her boyfriend and she may be acting out because of it? They were caught shoplifting together in May and he went to jail temporarily and during this they were fighting a lot, she asked if he could stay with us for a bit but it was my husband who said no.", "Why? She already told him multiple times that she was bothered by the broken china, and he continued to enable his sister by saying it was \"just accidents\". One broken plate is an accident - when it happens multiple times, it's deliberate malicious behavior. SIL got what she deserved.", "Nah, someone who intentionally breaks someone else's property for no reason deserves to be humiliated. Besides, where is the humiliation? All OP did was show everyone SIL's actions. If she was comfortable smashing plates in private, why isn't she comfortable smashing them in public?", "I did mention this to my husbands on multiple occasions.
