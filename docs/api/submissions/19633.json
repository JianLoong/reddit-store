There's too much missing from the story. Why do they think you are the cause? How long they have known you is irrelevant if, throughout the time they've known you they have had issues with you. Their reaction doesn't seem just out of the blue. It also doesn't make a lot of sense that you have been together 7 1/2 years and don't have much of an idea of what her 'issues' are.", "You did get her help, but a LOT is missing from this for anyone to really determine AITA properly. We don't know the specifics of your relationship, or if she has had a past of addiction etc. So much is missing from this story. But something tells me that because the parents and other family were so quick to remove her from your living situation that there has been some pattern of stuff with you. They may know something or have been told something by your g/f that you aren't aware of and this was the final straw. But we wouldn't know that either, so this one is really hard to determine. But good job either way getting her some care.\n\nEdit/update: see reply thread, but \"Well, in order to gain a little more insight into your \\[OP\\] character, I ventured into your \\[OP\\] profile, seems like you like to dabble in porn and even solicited some nudes from someone posting on reddit in comments and you say this girl is your g/f? Anyone who respects their g/f wouldn't be doing that. YTA for that particularly and it makes me question how you treat her IRL. Her parents probably pick up on things too. \n\nNTA for getting her help, but probably an asshole in other areas and this was the last straw for the parents (based on a brief character analyis from OP's profile comments/replys in NSFW threads).", "Taken at face value NTA but why do they think you\u2019re responsible for this?", "You probably saved her life by getting her help, NTA", "NTA Paramedics job is to treat not judge, you get home and find your partner unconscious and call for help they should be reassuring you, period.\n\nHer parents and brother are idiots and trying to blame someone that shouldn't be blamed.  They sound like complete control freaks.", "From the limited info you've given NTA. If you two were married the family wouldn't be able to deny you access to her at the hospital since you'd be next of kin. This is something you may want to think about doing if your GF will need ongoing treatment and you think they may pull this again.", "I feel like there's some information missing (such as why the parents blame you or are now forcing her to leave/break up with you??). Taken at face value, you are definitely NTA. Your gf needs to get some help for her issues and you all need to have a serious conversation about your relationship. She not only is not taking care of herself to the degree it's making you responsible for her basic safety, but her family is low-key threatening you and I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to involve law enforcement in the future and are clearly trying to break you all up. The fact you both have been together for so long and her parents have known you for so long makes this much worse. Is she giving your parents the impression that you are abusing her or something? You need to get some deep clarity from her or this relationship is doomed.", "NTA as you saved her life", "NTA.", "ESH- and I say this because obviously things haven't been talked about, GF has issues that seem to not have been dealt with via therapy, parents are holding you accountable for this because \"how could you not see it coming\" (they are in blame mode) and you are lashing out at them because they are trying to protect their daughter who does need loads of help at the moment.  That isnt helping anyone.    Sit down with them, ask them how she is doing, ask what you can do to help, explain you'd not seen her drink or evidence of her drinking at all before this.  And legally, you have no right to access her when she is hospital, thats why getting married sometimes is a good option.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How so? I'm pretty sure it would shed light on her parents' reaction to you if they did.", "Her parents have never outwardly had a problem with me, though, what they say behind closed doors I'm not privy to, I know that before we got together she was with someone who mentally and physically abused her and I'm not sure if the reason behind her doing what she did  is about him", "What do you want to know?", "Because she's been staying with me and it happened in my apartment", "Thanks, I'll be honest since it happened I've played through a lot of different scenarios in my head and started to feel I was in some way responsible", "Her family are enablers.  OP didn't pour the alcohol down her throat, but they can't blame their precious, sick daughter.", "I'm really hoping she won't, but I will discuss this with her at some point", "The only way I can currently get that is through her or her sister, and I get the feeling that neither are going to tell me if she is giving that impression. However, when I did ask her sister if that was why her parents were being this way with me, she told me that she had told them that she knew I would never treat my gf this way", "I mean their demeanour towards me the entire time they were here, I told them all the information I had when they arrived and saw them note it down, they then proceeded to ask me the same questions in a different way as if trying to see if my answers remained the same, once they had her in the ambulance one of the medics turned to me and told me to \"wait right there as they had more questions for me\" they left 10 mind later without anymore being said to me", "It sounds like there's a lot you haven't been privvy to and unless your gf shares what she's told them, or they share with you, not sure what you can do. Perhaps your gf's PTSD and past experience colors the way she sees the way you treat her -- like triggers and red flags that she compares to the abusive ex -- and she shares those things with her parents so they've put you in the same boat as him. I don't know and am totally speculating which is not fair. Telling them to GTH was not the greatest idea, but being blamed for something like hurting her like that I can see you being upset about. Based on info, NTA.", "What is her history of alcohol/drug abuse? What have her parents done to help treat the abuse? Did you give her access to the alcohol/drugs and they are blaming you for that access? Do you drink and possibly viewed as a bad influence on her if she's a recovering addict?", "Why do they blame you?", "Her parents are probably just looking for something to blame, guess you got caught in the crossfire. Although if their daughter is in the state you described the last thing she needs right now is a family feud", "The thing is, we have always been open and honest with each other when we do something that annoys or triggers the other one", "I have the occasional beer every now and again, but from what I found, it looks as if she has gone and bought 3 large bottles of vodka while I was at work and consumed them all, in the years that we've been together she has never shown any signs of alcohol or drug abuse as she knows I've very against it, I have not given her any access to drugs or alcohol as ill only go out and buy beers when I want to have one or two and it is only those that I'll buy she will occasionally ask me to buy her a bottle of wine but normally that lasts her several days", "Because she's been staying with me and it happened in my apartment, I have been unaware of any addiction issues prior to this, and she has never shown any signs of of alcohol/substance abuse before", "I understand that, which is why I've now stopped answering their calls and messages. The only contact I currently have is with my gf and her younger sister, who, as I say in the post, is the only one not blaming me", "Yeah that was just a guess on my part. There is something the family believes happened or thinks about you that is a mystery. Hopefully you can get some answers.", "So maybe she doesn\u2019t have a substance abuse problem but this was a suicide attempt instead.", "Hang on. Please clarify. \n\nYou say that she has never shown any signs of drug or alcohol abuse but yet you also say you restrict her from buying either/or. Except when you say it\u2019s ok to have a bottle of wine \u201cfor a few days\u201d. \n\nAm I misreading something here? Or is it time to go to sleep? Probably both.", "Well, for this particular situation you're not the asshole, but I still feel like something is missing giving the parents seemingly over reacting. Maybe they are control freaks and just want her watched in their care 24/7 now? They probably don't trust her to be alone. Makes sense after what can be viewed as a \"suicide\" attempt.", "Wait, do you mean you\u2019re currently talking to your gf and she\u2019s blaming you, but the little sister is the only one not blaming you? Or am I misreading?", "Wait... you're now not answering THEIR calls? What if they are trying to make ammends now and realized they were wrong and are wanting to appologize and you're just flat out ignoring them now? Answer the phone and speak with them. Jeeze.", "I'm trying to arrange a meeting with them to see if I can't try and put their minds at ease and also to apologise for what I said to them, it was said in frustration and anger", "I think you're reading too much into it or OP wasn't super clear, it may be a boundary for OP that neither of them should drink very much or have large amounts of alcohol in the house, so if he goes to buy a bit for himself she'll ask for him to grab her a bottle as well which shows they're open with each other about how much they're drinking. It's not an unreasonable or weird boundary.", "I think you've likely misread when I want to have a beer I'll go out and buy them as I don't keep them in the house when I'm going out to bit them shell ask me to buy her a bottle of wine as well I don't restrict her from buying it and I think as stupid as I can be at times I'd know if she was abusing alcohol or drugs as I've seen the signs of drug abuse before", "I understand. However, they are trying to stop me from seeing her, I know they know I care and am not sure as to why I am being blamed for what has happened, when I left for work that morning she was absolutely fine, telling me she was going to see her niece later that day and then I come home and find what I found, I know that people who are considering suicide will often mask their pain as I was the same 12 years ago, however she helped me through it and I thought I'd been helping her with what happened with her ex, maybe I was wrong.", "I mean of the family, my gf is not blaming me for what happened she just tells me she can't remember what happened that caused her to drink so much", "That\u2019s fair. \n\nI think it was just the wording and the vagueness of the post in general that got me confused.", "My apologies. \n\nIt was just a question which you have answered.", "Well, in order to gain a little more insight into your character, I ventured into your profile, seems like you like to dabble in porn and even solicited some nudes from someone posting on reddit in comments and you say this girl is your g/f? Anyone who respects their g/f wouldn't be doing that. YTA for that particularly and it makes me question how you treat her IRL. Her parents probably pick up on things too.", "So what if I do? She is well aware of it, and that doesn't change how I treat her IRL. She has always and will always be the light of my life, and I treat her with the utmost respect and honesty", "Wait, hold on. I have a problem with this assessment here. We don't know the extent to which they explore their own sexuality. What if it was deemed okay? Or if they're in. An open relationship? With my last partner, we were both allowed to seek out porn, it was never forbidden. Maybe let's not jump to conclusions because OP is doing something maybe YOU wouldn't be okay with? AFAIK, most couples are okay with porn.", "Well even so, it affects how OTHERS view you. I mean this is a court of opinion afterall. Because the parents decision here is weighed largely of your general treatement of her, nobody here knows you like they know you, so nobody here is going to give you the answers you need to feel better about this most likely.\n\nEdit: and there it is.. your downvote for logical dose of reality. Really not helping your defense here."]}
