There's too much missing from the story. Why do they think you are the cause? How long they have known you is irrelevant if, throughout the time they've known you they have had issues with you. Their reaction doesn't seem just out of the blue. It also doesn't make a lot of sense that you have been together 7 1/2 years and don't have much of an idea of what her 'issues' are.", "You did get her help, but a LOT is missing from this for anyone to really determine AITA properly. We don't know the specifics of your relationship, or if she has had a past of addiction etc. So much is missing from this story. But something tells me that because the parents and other family were so quick to remove her from your living situation that there has been some pattern of stuff with you. They may know something or have been told something by your g/f that you aren't aware of and this was the final straw. But we wouldn't know that either, so this one is really hard to determine. But good job either way getting her some care.\n\nEdit/update: see reply thread, but \"Well, in order to gain a little more insight into your \\[OP\\] character, I ventured into your \\[OP\\] profile, seems like you like to dabble in porn and even solicited some nudes from someone posting on reddit in comments and you say this girl is your g/f?

They sound like complete control freaks.", "From the limited info you've given NTA.

Taken at face value, you are definitely NTA. Your gf needs to get some help for her issues and you all need to have a serious conversation about your relationship. She not only is not taking care of herself to the degree it's making you responsible for her basic safety, but her family is low-key threatening you and I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to involve law enforcement in the future and are clearly trying to break you all up. The fact you both have been together for so long and her parents have known you for so long makes this much worse. Is she giving your parents the impression that you are abusing her or something? You need to get some deep clarity from her or this relationship is doomed.", "NTA as you saved her life", "NTA.", "ESH- and I say this because obviously things haven't been talked about, GF has issues that seem to not have been dealt with via therapy, parents are holding you accountable for this because \"how could you not see it coming\" (they are in blame mode) and you are lashing out at them because they are trying to protect their daughter who does need loads of help at the moment.  That isnt helping anyone.    Sit down with them, ask them how she is doing, ask what you can do to help, explain you'd not seen her drink or evidence of her drinking at all before this.

Perhaps your gf's PTSD and past experience colors the way she sees the way you treat her -- like triggers and red flags that she compares to the abusive ex -- and she shares those things with her parents so they've put you in the same boat as him. I don't know and am totally speculating which is not fair. Telling them to GTH was not the greatest idea, but being blamed for something like hurting her like that I can see you being upset about.

The only contact I currently have is with my gf and her younger sister, who, as I say in the post, is the only one not blaming me", "Yeah that was just a guess on my part. There is something the family believes happened or thinks about you that is a mystery.

Probably both.", "Well, for this particular situation you're not the asshole, but I still feel like something is missing giving the parents seemingly over reacting. Maybe they are control freaks and just want her watched in their care 24/7 now? They probably don't trust her to be alone.

It's not an unreasonable or weird boundary.", "I think you've likely misread when I want to have a beer I'll go out and buy them as I don't keep them in the house when I'm going out to bit them shell ask me to buy her a bottle of wine as well I don't restrict her from buying it and I think as stupid as I can be at times I'd know if she was abusing alcohol or drugs as I've seen the signs of drug abuse before", "I understand. However, they are trying to stop me from seeing her, I know they know I care and am not sure as to why I am being blamed for what has happened, when I left for work that morning she was absolutely fine, telling me she was going to see her niece later that day and then I come home and find what I found, I know that people who are considering suicide will often mask their pain as I was the same 12 years ago, however she helped me through it and I thought I'd been helping her with what happened with her ex, maybe I was wrong.", "I mean of the family, my gf is not blaming me for what happened she just tells me she can't remember what happened that caused her to drink so much", "That\u2019s fair. \n\nI think it was just the wording and the vagueness of the post in general that got me confused.", "My apologies. \n\nIt was just a question which you have answered.", "Well, in order to gain a little more insight into your character, I ventured into your profile, seems like you like to dabble in porn and even solicited some nudes from someone posting on reddit in comments and you say this girl is your g/f?

I have a problem with this assessment here. We don't know the extent to which they explore their own sexuality. What if it was deemed okay? Or if they're in. An open relationship? With my last partner, we were both allowed to seek out porn, it was never forbidden. Maybe let's not jump to conclusions because OP is doing something maybe YOU wouldn't be okay with? AFAIK, most couples are okay with porn.", "Well even so, it affects how OTHERS view you. I mean this is a court of opinion afterall.

How often does your girlfriend drink and has it ever gotten this bad before? \n\nHowever I would say YTA, as in your post history you have dabbled in porn and even solicited nudes from someone on Reddit.

The last time something this serious happened to their daughter, it was the fault of the boyfriend who was abusing her.  When something serious happened again, it was probably a reflex to blame you, her current boyfriend. The only person who can change their perception is your girlfriend. She needs to tell them how you treat her. There\u2019s really nothing you can do except reassure them, and tell them you are there for their daughter no matter what.", "NTA\n\nHer family is making her an ex-girlfriend.", "NAH. If she doesn't have a history of this sort of behavior, and her last relationship was abusive, then I have a hard time blaming her parents for jumping to conclusions.", "I'm sure I'll find out eventually", "I read your replies for context, and honestly ESH. The situation itself sucks. Her parents and brother suck for wrongfully blaming you for what happened to her. And you suck for the way you responded.\n\nTelling them to go to hell and ignoring their calls isn't going to help you here, my dude.", "Again, same as the last one, read through the replies, and you'll see I say she actively participates in reading/viewing/commenting on these subs", "Yah, something most def. ain't right with this story.", "OP won't sit down with them, in another reply, he's admitted to literally ignoring their phone calls now. lol", "Or as I've stated she is fully aware and participates in reading, viewing and commenting on those subs", "Read the reply threads, and you'll see that she knows all about it and actively participates in looking at/commenting on them.", "Nta remind them that she's an adult, living with another adult. If they try to come to your home to take her things, you'll call the authorities.", "Ask your gf about that then. Maybe she's vented about you a few times but her parents are overreacting anyway and it's not just based on what she's said. The fact that she drank herself comatose but they are blaming you already makes it sound like they're in denial and probably not level headed anyway. Either way, your gf (and I feel for her; I don't know all that she's going through mentally) needs to understand the position she's putting you in because it's not fair to you and her parents obviously can't be trusted. \n\nThis is separate, but y'all have been together for almost 8 years and known each other for 15-16 and you're not even engaged. Is there a reason for that? Maybe this is a wake up call for y'all because it sounds like there's deeper issues in the relationship.", "That still doesn\u2019t change my thinking. Regardless, her family found out some shit about YOU or the BOTH of you and overall don\u2019t like YOU nor do they want YOU around.", "Yeah and since I've been doing that I've had a chance to reflect on my behaviour towards them, which is why in another comment if you read it you'll see I say that I am trying to arrange a meeting with them.", "No, we've talked about it before, but it usually just ends up in us joking about seating charts as we both have family who we would want there that we know don't like each other", "Agree, more to the story and there has to be a reason for her parents to over react like this.", "You ALL need to attend therapy, I really agree with others that see this as a attempt to take their life.  Thats hard on everyone and impacts all.  Work together as much as you can.", "Sounds like you're on the right track then. And no, I didn't read that particular comment. I've read a lot of yours though, just not that one yet.", "Ok OP. This is from the Dad advice arena and from someone with a lot of family with PTSD and trauma.  It sounds like something happened that you need to find out about. This honestly sounds like something triggered this response and she might not be able to open up you you about it or given the parents reaction, this isn't the first time this has happened or they are the reason. Will follow and I hope you get thru this.", "Thanks, means a lot", "I'm sure they know I'm talking to my gf and her sister, and would find a way to get that info to me", "Good idea. I understand why you were upset but burning bridges isn't a good idea right now\n\nEdit to add: I'm sorry they're blaming you for something you can't control.", "I think you are being scapegoated. If she was in an abusive relationship before, there is definitely some trauma from her childhood that is driving this pattern of self-destructive behavior, and the parents likely know what it is/what they did. They are possibly projecting their own feelings of guilt onto you to protect their self-image and reputation. If this is the case, it will not be likely that you can reason with them. They're deliberately throwing you under the bus.", "You don't HAVE to let them in if they wanna collect her things. Lol you aren't home. She's an adult, they can't bar you from visiting the hospital unless they have power of attorney.", "Yeah I stopped answering calls/ reading their messages as I needed time to get my head right as even I was blaming myself, I kept thinking \"what I'd I hadn't gone to work that day\" or \" what would have happened if I was later getting home\", I needed time to sort that out in my head before I tried to sort things out with them and apologise", "Either way, I'm gonna try. There are logs showing that I was at work from 9 am until 10:30 pm, plus messages between us as late as 2 pm, so I have evidence I was not there during the day", "And it's not your fault.", "That makes total sense! If you are able to, it would also potentially help to see a therapist. This is a lot of stress to handle", "They are massive assholes", "Well that's fine, but since not a lot of details are provided, we have to make our own conclusions. OP claims she knows, but I wouldn't immediately think that was true. I think its a safe assumption that most (not all) g/f's would feel slighted if their sig. other was propositioning people on the internet for nudes. Without actually speaking with her, we'll never know how she feels. So I'm making a general assumption that she probably wouldn't appreciate it. I think its a much smaller population that would be OK with this. I think people who are into open relationships are a much smaller % of the population, so I'm going with that take if we were to pick a side.", "dont worry about these kinds of comments man, there is a sizeable contingent of users both here and the relationshipadvice sub that are very very passionately anti-porn, and they seem to just crawl thru these subs looking for any mention of porn so they can jump down peoples throats about their puritanical obsessions.", "I get that, however my gf is well aware and quite often has sat with me looking through these subreddits and has been the one to post (all be it using my account as she doesn't have one of her own)", "There's way too much information missing.", "NTA at all.

Moreover, in spite of the length of the relationship, you apparently know no details of her previous abusive relationship or of any drug/substance issues. I'm really getting the feeling that there's a lot of stuff you're not saying or stuff that your GF has told her parents about the relationship to make them automatically blame you and cut off any visitation. So INFO please.", "Probably YTA. Your post is lacking in detail and the paramedics' attitudes towards you is throwing up red flags.
