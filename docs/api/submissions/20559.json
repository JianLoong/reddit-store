I feel sorry for her but I also kinda don't. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: y'all seem to think my fam's super abusive and treats me different, but actually we get treated pretty much the same. It's just that M was at a disadvantage and clearly very upset so I got the lecturing this time. As for why they didn't stop her comments, I just asked a few of my relatives and the responses were: first off, they wanted us to resolve our differences like adults and didn't feel the need to pitch in, and secondly, her insults can be loosely interpreted as jokes since she said them in a joking manner like she expected us to laugh, and no one had the heart to tell her to leave, cause it isn't uncommon for people that fail the entrance exam to off themselves over here, so people were walking on eggshells around M. \n\n\nAs for my dad, he compares me to everyone we know. The neighbour's kid, random teen on the news etc. I've told him I don't like being compared to M, and usually he stops, and yeah maybe he's a bit of an AH for not listening to me but idc cause he's a wonderful father, and super proud of me.", "created_utc": 1687703842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14inuz9/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_when_she_was_down/", "score": 1487, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not everyone is smart enough to be a scientist, and we actually need way more laborers than advanced science degrees. It shouldn't be a mark of shame to work in construction or retail, or to not be a university student.\n\nI dealt with a lot of that shame in my 20s. I eventually went back to school at 30 and earned awards for having such high grades. I don't believe I deserve to be lifted above other people socially, and I don't believe you deserve to be poor if you don't get a degree. There need to be monetary incentives to motivate people to seek out those degrees when they are in demand, but I think everyone should be able to have a good quality of life.\n\nWe can do a lot better. Especially in the way we treat people who are less educated or professionally successful.", "NTA - however, as a note to your edit: yes, you ARE treated differently, otherwise there would be no need to compare you to everybody they ever know! That seems to indicate that you are never enough, and that is not how anyone should treat their child. You are your own person. In my opinion (and I cannot stress enough that this is my opinion), anyone who is proud of their kid does NOT compare them to others! They will only celebrate their kid's accomplishments. And comparing you to someone else is also NOT the same as pushing anyone to try harder, it will only create resentment (to whomever you are being compared to) and a sense that you are never enough. \r  \n\r  \nAs for M: it seems that she has always been the Golden Child. Her behaviour with the snide remarks and such can have 3 possible reasons:\r  \n1) She feel immensly superior to you (and others perhaps) because she has always been treated like she is superior. She feels like she is always the better/smarter person, and this once she was not, hence the remarks, trying to put you down.\r  \n2) She has always been treated like she is superior but in reality she is super insecure (who knows how hard she has to work to get the grades and such) and does not want to show this (or is afraid to - due to how (mainly) her parents treat her).\r  \n3) She has always been treated like she is superior, but is secretly suffering from being the 'Golden Child' but she feels that she HAS to be that child no matter what, alwatys has to be the top performer. Her lower grades can then make her feel inferior and feels like a total failure because all she has ever known is that she HAS to be the best in everything. That is not an easy thing to bear. \r  \n\r  \nMaybe you can talk to M in private and just ask about how she is feeling, about everything. Tell her how you have always been compared to her (especially regarding the age difference and as you mention, her being a grade higher in the first place) and how that feels. And ask if there are reasons for how she has been behaving (with the snide remarks and such). If it turns out she is just a nasty person and actually just feels superior (like #1 above), then you can just let her be, ignore her (to whatever extent you feel comfortable). But if it turns out there is more to her behavior, you can offer to help, in whatever capacity you can. \r  \n\r  \nLastly: YOU DO YOU! It sounds like you have plans for the future, and I hope you get into the university you want to and I am sure you'll do well! Good luck with everything.", "NTA, sounds like your parents are the problem. I\u2019m sure they are pitting her against you as much as they are pitting you against everyone.

We\u2019ve now been best friends for years and don\u2019t really speak to our parents.", "But it wasn\u2019t M\u2019s fault that that happened.

I had a very similar story to this with my cousin and we hated each other growing up but once we realized why(we were constantly competing whether we were together or not, building up resentment and jealousy towards one another), we became best friends, practically inseparable. It\u2019s easy to let these things get to you but you have to remember these are not YOUR thoughts or opinions they are thoughts and opinions that have been PLACED onto you, therefore they are not relevant to you or M whatsoever.
