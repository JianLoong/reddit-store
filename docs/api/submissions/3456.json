She has a kid Zyanna(11f), and Zyanna has been having issues lately with authority figures. Just with anyone telling her to do something or someone telling her, \"No.\" \n\nZyanna stays the weekend at my house with my dad(50M) and my daughter(9), whenever she stays with me, I have her do 2 chores: brush out the cat, and keep the room she is staying in clean. Sometimes, I'll ask for her help regarding clear the table or put dishes away, but only if I have to hurry for dinner or guests. I've only asked for her help twice, that's it. Well, yesterday she told me she will no longer be doing chores here because she's a \"guest\" and she shouldn't have to. I told her she's family, not a guest. Yes, she will have to if she's going to continue staying with me on weekends. She said no again, along with go F myself. I told her okay if you're a guest, not family, then I will no longer buy her clothes, makeup, shoes, or anything else.\" ,\" She will no longer be allowed at my house on weekends, Zyanna started to cry and ran to the room. \n\nMy dad asked what had happened, and I told him he agreed with me that just because she does whatever she wants over at her mom's house, she will not do it here. Her mom Patty comes over that same day. I tell her, and she just talks about how she doesn't know where Zyanna gets that from. My dad tells Patty it's from her, she's mom, you're the main influence on Zyanna. Patty denies it, I told Patty she will not be coming back to my house unless she apologizes and starts to respect an adult. Patty  thinks im being \"too harsh on an 11 year old.\" Patty, for some unknown reason, treats Zyanna like a 15/16 year old, and they will both argue like teenagers. I do not do that with my daughter. She's a kid. When I tell her to go clean her room or do a chore, she does it. It is not up for discussion or negotiation. \n\nI also found out from Patty that her grandmother doesn't allow Zyanna at her house due to stealing, lying, and sneaking out with boys. I love Zyanna. I really do, but she's heading down a bad path, Zyanna has mentioned before about wanting to live with me. I can't allow that because of my daughter. She's a great kid, listens, and is a great student/athlete. I will not allow her to be influenced.\n\nI am open to criticism, bad or good. \n\nEDIT #1: A lot of people have brought up me going from 0-100 on this 1 instance. The reason I went that far is because I've talked to Zyanna on MANY occasions about her behavior to other adults and her Mom. I told her that the real world is a lot worse, strangers will not care how you feel. If you don't get your way, the world will not care. The world and people don't owe u anything.  \n\nEDIT#2: It has also been brought up about my daughter. She stays with her grandparents/dad sometimes on the weekends, at their house it is fun time all the time, she is always on \"Play mode\" over there. But when she comes home she acts appropriately. I'm not saying she won't ever act out, she will someday and when that day comes I will NOT blame Zyanna because she doesn't have much exposure to her. If someone will be blamed it will be ME since I am mom.\n\nEDIT #3 Brushing out the cat \"Candy\" was Zyanna choice. She loves Candy. Candy loves being brushed out. I wasn't forcing her. She willingly asked that to be her chore.", "created_utc": 1669660607, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z74ea4/aita_for_telling_my_niece_she_is_no_longer/", "score": 1350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The pet is your household's pet, thus all care should be your household's responsibility), in general you're not asking anything unreasonable.\n\nThat being said, the behavior she's exhibiting is extreme, especially for an 11 year old. And i am concerned that no one here is actually looking out for the child. She expressed wanting to live with you. What is her home life like?

I can understand the possibility because you see the trouble ahead and how it could influence your daughter.

If you really want to try to keep things as they are I would explain the basic rules again, and ask her if she wants to negotiate which chore she has to do. Something else that needs doing 1x a week besides the cat. And be sure to give her lots of good attention, just noticing things she\u2019s interested in, talents she has, etc. That good attention can go a long ways towards soothing a rebellious spirit.", "NTA. Bad apples in every family. Don't let your kid get influenced by her before it's too late. At the end of the day, she is not your responsibility. Think about your daughter. Do not let her come again. She's already stealing and lying at her age, imagine what she'd be up to if she was actually an adult.", "NTA she needs to learn that she's 11 not an adult. Behavior like hers should be nipped at the bud. If she continues down this path she may very well end up in juvie down the line. Also sneaking out to meet with boys is a huge red flag OP. No child at that age should be active with boys especially not in that way. She is acting like this because your sister likely treats her like she's older than she is. And your sister seems immature as well for stooping down to fight with an 11 year old like they're both angsty teenagers. There's something that needs to be done about her behavior before it's too late; weather it's more discipline at home or her getting harsher consequences for her actions. I 100% agree NTA because if she's gonna show no respect then she deserves no respect in return.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand this. If I had spoke to my aunt this way she would have whipped my butt.  And my mom let us get away with a lot but we knew not to act the same way with other adults. It\u2019s respect for elders and their authority in their own house. Especially when under their care and when they buy you things and treat you well.", "NTA the bottom line is you are responsible for raising and advocating for your children. Your niece is not your responsibility and is acting in a way that could be detrimental to your children. You are doing the right thing", "I think I have to say YTA here, I think you are being pretty harsh. Zyanna is *11*, which is very young, and it sounds like you might be one of the only stable adults in her life.  And you threatened to stop letting her into your home - a safe space for her - because of one instance of saying no to doing chores? Refusing to do chores is such a mild, tame, normal pushing-boundaries behavior for that age. Like, I think even extremely healthy and well-adjusted kids get bratty about chores. And kicking her out of your home, which is part of her normal routine, is so drastic and extreme. Why not start with refusing to buy her makeup, or taking away some other privilege, or even giving it more than *a single day* and trying to talk to her about it? \n\nI have no doubt that you would never consider kicking your daughter out if she refused to do a chore. Sure she doesn't now, but what about when she starts to enter her tween/teen years? Zyanna is in such a rough spot that she's asking to live with you full time, it sounds like her living situation might not be healthy or safe. I think she is *asking* to be in a position where she can be saved from a \"bad path\". Kicking her out will teach her that no matter how vulnerable she is, your support and love for her is so extremely conditional that one single act of insubordination is enough to break it. She'll learn that the one responsible adult in her life that might be able to help her, can't be trusted. And speaking of influences on your daughter, I can think of a few *very* harmful lessons she could learn from you doing this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tween and teen years are tough, she's not going to be 9 forever. Kids have different behavioral issues as they age.\n\n>I can't help a child who is fighting back against the only people who have helped her. \n\nIs this not what children do?

If her mom lets her do whatever she wants, why would she want to live with you \"because you'll let her do whatever\" if she's *already getting that* by living with her mom? Also, it must have been pretty jarring for her to see you go from never acting with authority to fully kicking her out of your house. Like, why not start with a more simple punishment? Why go from 0-100 like that? I'm starting to suspect that you already didn't want to deal with her anymore, and were going looking for any excuse to get her out of your life.

It makes zero sense for OP to open her home to someone who has no respect for adults or authority.

If adults are expected to do things she can't/doesn't want to, that opens the conversation up to letting her pick between extra responsibility she doesn't want or being treated like a kid instead, with the tradeoff of losing some of her autonomy/negotiating power (just not all of it- a kid with a chaotic home life probably wants to exert control, and going too far the other way and controlling everything FOR her is going to get her back up)", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re trying to set boundaries for her.
