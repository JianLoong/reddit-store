The thing is, your friend was probably brought up in a home or culture  that focused on the desirability and appearance of a woman as being what makes her worth a damn. Annnd she has internalized it to the point that she acts and dresses the way she does  because deep down *she thinks that\u2019s what she is supposed to do*. \n\nAnd here you told her that was \u2026 *bad*, or at least not going to get her seen as anything but a little fuckable piece of meat.\n\nAnd that can be hard to hear. That can shake a persons world view. \n\nNTA Your \u201csoccer guy\u201d analogy was a good one. Maybe she will think on it.", "nta. you were just giving her honest feedback. it's important to be aware of how we present ourselves to others and how that might influence their perception of us. hopefully she can take your advice and find a healthy balance between expressing her sexuality and being valued for her personality.", "Nta. She demanded an answer and you told her.", "NTA, she doesn't want to take responsibility of her own actions. If she wants to show her body, she can most definitely... however, she will attract a certain crowd of people. She is most likely super insecure under all that flirtatious and sexual energy. \n\nYou said the right thing in that conversation, it's a tough pill to swallow for her but you saying this can ultimately be a good thing in the long run.", "NTA.  You told her honestly the way things are.  That is what real friends do.", "NTA She asked you answered. People really need to stop with this whole just because I dress act speak and hook up like a duck does not mean I am a duck .... You are what you portray to the world. That is just the way it is.. you wanted to get treated better hold YOURSELF to the standard you are looking to find.  That isn't slut shaming that is reality. It's sad that people forget the basics dress for the job you want not the one you have... aka you want to find someone willing to get into a legit relationship long term... stop dressing acting and posting thirst traps like a party girl. Live how you want but stop blaming others for their perception of you based on what you put out there. How you dress, what you post, how you act like it or not DOES factor in.", "NTA she asked for your honest opinion, and you gave YOUR honest opinion. However, you called her a slut for putting herself out there. Anyone who thinks whatever they see on social media is exactly who someone is as black and white is a very naive person. I know plenty of \"slutty\" people who's social media is all church, praise Jesus, perfect housewife type and very prudent people who's social media is all beach bikini pics and sex positive messages. You need to look at the reddit thread on what women were wearing when they were sexually harassed to give yourself a better perspective.\n\nYou could have spoken to her about ways to address what she's looking for and set boundaries early in an exchange with a new potential partner. It sounds like she's pursuing things with the wrong partners. Maybe help her figure out what signals she's missing that indicate they're only looking for sex so she can do a better job of filtering them out.", "YTA. You don't even like this girl and you are certainly not her friend. Leave her alone.", "YTA with absolutely ridiculous misogynistic takes. \n\nYou obviously have no respect for this woman so stop pretending to be her friend while you neg her into hopefully sleeping with you (she won\u2019t) and get a life.", "NTA, with a caveat. \n\nLook... she should be able to be sexually open and still have a relationship. She deserves one. The way she lives her life is fine, she's not doing anything wrong.\n\nI would not call her a slut. That's a pejorative that only she can claim. I bring this up because honestly... she's your friend. That's not nice. \n\nUnfortunately, people do tend to assume that a relationship that starts with sex won't be something more, because the emotional connection isn't attempted first. She's not approaching relationships in a way that will get her what she wants (sex AND a relationship). In fact, it seems like sex is her go-to method for connecting with men, which I don't think works well in general in the cultures we all live in. \n\nI can't tell from your post whether this is unhealthy behaviour or not, but it's definitely not working for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
