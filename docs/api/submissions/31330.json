The thing is, your friend was probably brought up in a home or culture  that focused on the desirability and appearance of a woman as being what makes her worth a damn.

If she wants to show her body, she can most definitely... however, she will attract a certain crowd of people.

That is just the way it is.. you wanted to get treated better hold YOURSELF to the standard you are looking to find.  That isn't slut shaming that is reality. It's sad that people forget the basics dress for the job you want not the one you have... aka you want to find someone willing to get into a legit relationship long term... stop dressing acting and posting thirst traps like a party girl. Live how you want but stop blaming others for their perception of you based on what you put out there. How you dress, what you post, how you act like it or not DOES factor in.", "NTA she asked for your honest opinion, and you gave YOUR honest opinion. However, you called her a slut for putting herself out there. Anyone who thinks whatever they see on social media is exactly who someone is as black and white is a very naive person. I know plenty of \"slutty\" people who's social media is all church, praise Jesus, perfect housewife type and very prudent people who's social media is all beach bikini pics and sex positive messages. You need to look at the reddit thread on what women were wearing when they were sexually harassed to give yourself a better perspective.\n\nYou could have spoken to her about ways to address what she's looking for and set boundaries early in an exchange with a new potential partner. It sounds like she's pursuing things with the wrong partners.

I bring this up because honestly... she's your friend.

If what she wants is to sleep around, I\u2019d have no issue with that, I\u2019m just saying portraying herself as somebody that sleeps around and wants to while really wanting a serious relationship is counterproductive", "You\u2019re not entirely wrong and I wouldn\u2019t want to get with someone who is addicted to outside validation but there was no need to call her a slut and the insult (description?) is so outdated.

Her problem is not that she doesn't like sex or doesn't want people to be sexually attracted to her, it's that people don't seem to be interested in any other aspect of her. You basically confirmed that for her, or at least didn't dissuade her.\n\nIt might be that, like many people, she is socially awkward and has trouble getting people interested in her without using sex. It's not that she wants everyone to perceive her sexually. That's just the only way she knows to get attention. You told her what not to do, but not what to do. In her mind, the alternative to sexualizing herself is to be alone.\n\n>As an analogy, I like soccer.

Yeah, maybe if you brought up soccer in every conversation, you'd be encouraged to explore other interests, but you wouldn't be shamed for liking soccer or told you should like it less.\n\nShe might need to develop some other interests. Or it might be that she has some, if you would ask her about them. If you want to be her friend, you need to stop having sex with her, so she can see that's not the only reason you value her. Then maybe she can get some experience developing friendships not based on sex.", "NTA, your analogy was a really good one and hopefully she will reflect on that. Since she was demanding an answer there was nothing you could say that wouldn\u2019t upset her. \nI used to be like her.

She's ascribing the term \"slut shaming\" to your words and is more concerned with being offended by that, her misrepresented summary, than listening and considering it as an actual, potential problem.

I thought people nowadays are all for female empowerment! Sleep with whoever you want! Nowhere did OP state he doesn\u2019t like being in a fwb with her and she clearly wants a fwb with him. Sounds like 2 consenting adults who are agreeing to the same rules. You don\u2019t HAVE to like the person you are having sex with lol", "what the fuck are you talking about?\n\nno where in the post does OP imply he doesnt like her", "Make this comment make sense. OP doesn\u2019t want to date her. That doesn\u2019t mean he dislikes her.", "Are you replying to the right post, OP didn\u2019t tell anyone what they should or shouldn\u2019t wear?", "As someone else said are you even replying to the right post? He never told her what to wear, he simply pointed out a fact, just like she has every right to wear what she wants, men have every right not to want to pursue a romantic connectionz", "and people can have their own feelings about like, like not wanting anything serious from her.", "Reading comprehension Is hard uh", "learn to read", "A) he wasn\u2019t misogynistic \nB) shes already had sex with him multiple times\nC) learn to read\nD) your comment says ALOT about you, by the fact you evidently felt personally attacked.", "You do know what fwb means and what actions it entails correct?", "Oof I really relate. Tbh that validation can be addictive. Unfortunately, that's what she's looking for in a relationship, instead of an authentic connection.", "I do think that you need to stop sleeping with her after this conversation. Even if she claims she wants to. Nothing good is going to come of it.", "Yes, she deserves a relationship is the same way men \u201cdeserve\u201d sex - they don\u2019t. Because no one owes other people these things.", "They obviously mean in it then sense that everyone \"deserves\" to be loved and cared for.", "Being honest about being an asshole doesn't change the fact you're an asshole.", "Him viewing women like that makes him 100% the asshole. All day every day.", "It's possible to tell the truth and still be an asshole.", "Yes, lie to women and probably most men. No one wants to hear the truth ever.", "Why is he \"using\" her? The terms of their relationship seem to be well defined, he's not giving her false promises and he's having consentual, and, presumably, mutually pleasurable sex with her. He would be hypocritical if he imposed a moral judgement on her - if he said that her behavior is wrong or unjustifiable. At least as per his description, he did not do that - he just gave her his opinion on why her actions to not lead to the outcome she desires", "He never said hes a saint? Hes not the one complaining about people not seeing him for his personality, she wants sex, he obliges her. The fact youve tried to turn this around on him is honestly embarrassing for you and says alot about you.", "He is \"using\" her because they both wanna sleep wirh each other?\n\nthey are consenting adult, stop trying to spin it in a way that makes it seem as if she isnt", "\"Uses\" is a charged word, but how is OP hypocritical for \"using her the way he sees her\"? Doesn't his behavior support his point?", "Happy to be old fashioned. I don't fuck people I don't have basic respect for. \n\n\nI see very little real friendship in the way op is judging her.", "Bruh what? No one said you don\u2019t respect someone just because you don\u2019t want to date them. fuck you talking about \ud83d\ude44", "\"the Word slut got mentioned, so clearly OP is slutshaming her and therefore OP Tells his friend what she can wear\"\n\nhonestly idk how some people think", "Very much so on this subreddit...", "That's also an unfortunately common trope in romance novels that seriously needs to go away. The whole \"I felt like I had no worth until a man called me pretty\" bs is just all-around disgusting. It's not an authentic connection and an unhealthy foundation for a relationship.", "There\u2019s nothing more shallow than the validation of a man trying to sleep with you. \n\nCommitment is where men show their true feelings.", "How do you come to that conclusion? Isn\u2019t that up for OP and the girl to decide who both seem adults?", "Exactly", "What exactly did he do again? She asked for an honest answer. He gave her the honest answer. \n\nIf she wants to portray her body, people will like her body. If she shows her hobbies, likes and dislikes, people will like her for her personality.\n\nI can't love you if all I know about you is your body", "That is an accurate statement that has absolutely nothing to do with the scenario being discussed.", "But he didn't do anything that was being an asshole. It is perfectly reasonable to have higher standards for a relationship than a sex partner.  He hasn't criticized her for presenting her sexuality first and foremost. He has just explained when questioned.", "Okay sure, every guy she encounters is an asshole because they perceive her the way she acts. Whatever.", "true, which was not the case here.", "Not usually when the person is demanding the truth. OP tried to go with the nice way, then went with the hard truth", "Explain exactly how he was an asshole here.", "No but you don't understand she's a dainty little sweet princess being taken advantage of by the misogynistic op. Shame on you op for using this woman's sexuality to have sex,while she obviously is just a essentially a lost child. Cause all women can't choose to have sex with a partner themselves apparently, I mean I just see it all the time, any time someone doesn't like something op is doing, just accuse him of sexually coercing women Un consensually.\n\nWhy bother making an argument against men to see if they're actually guilty of something and instead just treat everyone woman like a small brain dead child and treat all men like evil freakish rapists/sexual assaulters. Atleast that's what a ton of these threads seem to want to tell me. Why bother trying to see if a man is a good person when you can just make up lies? I mean that seems like the consensus here", "Oh...well then I guess I'm confused as to what you meant then. See I thought you were saying that, because he said this woman basically over-sexualizes herself, that he doesn't respect her. I think that what he was trying to say, maybe poorly, is that she IS actually making sex a huge part of her personality. There isn't anything wrong with that if that's all your after. But if all a woman wants to talk about is sex, alot of people are going to assume that that's all she has to offer them at the moment and would likely not want to date her. Ultimately I feel like there is a little immaturity on both their ends.", "It\\`s not even shallow, it\\`s just bullshit. They just say what you want to hear.", "Yes they are both adults but it\u2019s just common sense at this point. It\u2019s good advice, and she\u2019s already upset by it. Whether she\u2019ll deny it later or not. Her actions have shown she\u2019ll use this in arguments.", "The fact he believes that to be the answer is the problem. He's fine with her being sexual with HIM. But towards anyone else, he calls it slutty.  \n\n\nLet me reword this for you: Being a misogynist turd is still being a misogynist turd even if you admit you're a misogynist turd and frame it as advice.  \n\n\nEnjoy this incel fan fiction all you want.", "Every guy hasn't weighed in. Just this one. You see that, right?", "But he never found the constructive way. Telling someone everything is fine is unhelpful, but just telling them what they're doing wrong isn't much better. Most people don't take that well. Do you? Because it's not actually that helpful. Most people can think of the idea to stop doing what they're doing on their own, but without a suggestion of what to do instead, it doesn't necessarily solve their problem.", "I see what you\u2019re saying", "Oh it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be untrue, they\u2019re just saying it to get what they want. \n\nI think it\u2019s just that largely that most guys will sleep with someone they don\u2019t think is good enough to date."]}
