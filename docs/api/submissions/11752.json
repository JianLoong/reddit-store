{"id": 11752, "submission_id": "11lkjfg", "title": "AITA for encouraging my brother to purposefully plan his wedding on a weekend my wife is busy so she can't attend?", "selftext": "Let me start this off by saying I love my wife.\n\nHopefully that will soften the blow as I also say that she's an absolute nightmare around my brother.\n\nI wouldn't say my brother is the easiest person to get along with. He has a sarcastic sense of humor that can be an acquired taste for some. He likes to keep a small circle of friends and doesn't make a huge amount of effort to get to know people he knows he won't vibe well with. Still, I have introduced him to many people in my life and I have never gotten a reaction like the one my wife exhibits. He has easily fit into my friend group up to this point.\n\nThe way he has described it from his point of view is this, copied from our texts: \"Every time I interact with her, I feel like I'm in some kind of uncanny valley nightmare scenario. She feels like a one dimensional character whose whole personality is 'hypocrite.' It's as if she doesn't have a personality other than being outraged about something.\"\n\nHis partner is a very easy going guy, and has become one of my closest friends. I thought he and my wife would really get along. But because he and I usually only hang out around my brother, his opinion has been tainted by seeing nothing but this awful side of her, too.\n\nMy brother and his partner are getting married. Last weekend, my brother came to me and said he wanted me to be there, but he didn't want my wife to attend. He said he knew what an awkward position if he didn't invite her, but he didn't see another solution. Because he and his partner aren't planning a ceremony that has to be booked months in advance (they're having a courthouse wedding and then hosting a celebration at partner's parents' home), I suggested a weekend I knew she was going to be out of town for a business trip. I would tell my wife she was invited, she would say she couldn't come, and all would be well. He and his partner agreed that it would work, and we moved on.\n\nLast night, I got a text from my mom saying it was awful that I was conspiring against my own wife, and that planning this behind her back was beyond disrespectful. I pointed out that I was simply doing so to prevent a fight, but she wasn't hearing me.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: I can't recount every single topic they've argued about, but most of the incidents boil down to my wife assuming the worst of my brother in every situation with no intention to ever hear him out or get to know him without conflict.\n\nEDIT 2: Examples of interactions between them are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lkjfg/comment/jbd3kzo/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lkjfg/comment/jbd5wpf/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "created_utc": 1678245094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lkjfg/aita_for_encouraging_my_brother_to_purposefully/", "score": 549, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife deserves so much better than to be surrounded by classist, snobby assholes like your brother and BIL and a husband who clearly doesn\u2019t have her back.", "Story time: My family comes from a different party of the country than my husband's family. My accent is similar to theirs, but there are a few words that I pronounce quite differently. When we were first dating, I would get comments every time I said one of these words, about how I was pronouncing it wrong. I laughed it off for a while, until it got so aggravating that I didn't anymore. From that point on, anytime any of his family commented on my accent, they would get an earful. \n\nThese things that you think are minor have probably been building and festering, and your wife is at the point where she can't stand it anymore. Stop being YTA and start actually listening to what your wife is telling you.", "Someone putting their foot in their mouth by \u201caccidentally\u201d insulting someone else\u2019s achievements should apologize. \n\nThe offending party deserves to listen to the offense they\u2019ve caused, then acknowledge and apologize, and ask for forgiveness.", "YTA. GENUINELY leave your wife be my god she deserves someone so much better. You let your brother and his spouse insult and use RUDE \u201chumor\u201d to degrade her and because she doesn\u2019t find it funny she is a \u201cnightmare\u201d as YOU describe her. You literally do not love your wife dude.", "I dare you to say this to the face of the nurses who care for you in a hospital. Many, not all, are two year prepared community college nurses. I dare you to tell them they didn\u2019t get a proper education.", "Some go to community college for two years and then transfer for their degree. They get the same degree they would have if they'd gone to the four-year school for all four years, but they spent a lot less money. Seems pretty smart to me.", "It can still be offensive to tell someone you can get them into proper college.       \nIt can be seen as telling them they haven\u2019t done good enough on their own.       \nThat they need your help to make it in life.      \n\nNot saying I agree.       \nIf it wasn\u2019t for the \u2018proper college\u2019 comment I\u2019d be happy for his help.        \n\nI just think he could have been less offensive in what he said.", "community college is a proper college. not only is it a more plausible option for a lot of people, but some people don\u2019t want to pay ridiculous money for a four year college when the degree they want can be covered in two years for cheaper.", "ESH you all suck. Clearly you and your brother are privileged people, and your wife is unhappy about that privilege. But your brother is right too that she shouldn\u2019t have married you if she disagrees with your lifestyle. Being around someone who constantly puts down and compares your life is not healthy. And you have clearly taken your brother\u2019s side. Your wife will find out you excluded her and it will all blow in your face.", "You\u2019d think he\u2019d appreciate another \u201cbiting sense of humor\u201d.", "INFO: This is the clearest example of their dynamic that you\u2019ve given so far. And really this all boils down to what their dynamic is. You mention his \u201csarcastic sense of humor\u201d and her being an \u201cabsolute nightmare,\u201d but it\u2019s still really unclear what that looks like. You also mentioned that lots of their disagreements center around classism. \n\nDoes he regularly make classist/prejudiced remarks and she\u2019s sick of it? Did he say or do something really messed up before and now she\u2019s on guard around him and notices it more? Or does she read classism in to everything he says because of unsubstantiated prejudice against him? Are they both assholes who just press each others buttons? To me, whether or not you are the asshole depends completely on which one of them is the asshole.", "Dude. Every comment shows you are NOT on her team. You back up everything your brother says as normal behavior and hers as irrational. Do you even like her, seriously?", "I assume you've asked her about this, how does she explain it? She just sounds so hostile in that anecdote I'm curious what her perspective is.", "Have her reactions been like that from the moment they met? After all this time, do you have some idea of why she feels a need to point out your brother\u2019s privileged comments?", "I have included other examples in the comments. I will link them in the main post.", "Offering to help someone get a better education is different than talking about an education someone already acquired. You know those are apples and oranges.", "Sure. But what does that have to do with someone offering to help with financing a better education and getting offended by it? \n\nAgain, I have nothing against community college.", "LOL we found the brother", "I think that was the whole point, that University is expensive and he was offering to help find ways to finance it.", "\u261d\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02\u261d\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02\u261d\ufe0f", ">Or does she read classism in to everything he says because of unsubstantiated prejudice against him?\n\nI lean towards this option. Another clear example I can give of her automatically thinking the worst of him was a time when we were sitting on his back patio as the sun went down. It was getting chilly, so he went inside and grabbed a jacket for her as she was wearing short sleeves. She kind of rolled her eyes and pointed out that he could've asked if she needed one / implied he thought she was stupid for sitting outside in short sleeves. \n\nMaybe he should've asked. I know some women aren't interested in men doing things for them unprompted. But it seemed like an overreaction and put a damper on an otherwise good night.", "She claims that she can't help that her temper flares around him and that whatever she was responding to (which, in this case, was a simple \"you know how it is\") was malicious or belittling.", "Dude. YTA is the verdict in the majority of the comments. Stop trying to come up with examples about how your WIFE sucks. It\u2019s embarrassing.", "She\u2019s not the one instigating - your brother is. She\u2019s just not putting up with it.", "I think telling someone they can help their siblings get into \u201cproper university\u201d is judgmental, shitty, and classist especially if said community college education is good enough to save lives AND help WASN\u2019T WANTED. He responded to her talking about her brother\u2019s education with \u201che\u2019s doing it wrong. Let me fix it for you.\u201d", "You seem to like your brother more than your wife. In alot of your comments you defend him over you wife why is that?", "I was ready to call you an AH but this was an overreaction. I think both are at fault", "This sounds odd. If your brother clearly isn't a fan of hers, then why would he do something like grabbing her a jacket without being asked?\n\nNothing makes sense here. I can see how that seems like an overreaction on your wife's part but there has to be some bigger issue or situation that happened before that has made her see him as classist and belittling. But honestly, even in the situation above, why did your brother single her out like that? Had he grabbed jackets for everyone and then your wife reacts that way - waaay overreacting. But for two people who just don't mash, why is he doing such an act??\n\nAlso your brother clearly does belittle your wife, based on the insert from the text before.", "You could tell 1000 similar stories in this vein and they would not even come close to adding up to being worthy of not being invited to the wedding. Jesus Christ.\n\nI'd love for her to come on Reddit and post her version of events. I feel pretty confident that it would paint your brother in much worse light. Of course, her doing as much would require you to grow a pair of balls and actually address the wedding situation rather than you trying to hide behind your wife's availability.\n\nThe fact that your mom, who has every reason to side with her own son rather than a woman who is supposedly shitty to her son, says a lot!!!", "Ya now you are trying to just make your brother look less bad compared to your other comments since you realized they aren\u2019t doing it on this thread", "Does she respond that way to you if you talk about things in a similar manner around her? Meaning, if you had said something similar about the \"you know how it is\", or other things that might be seen as classist, does she get riled up about that?", "I don't agree with the other people on this thread. Saying that \"you know what it is like\" in reference to a few week holiday is not elitism. Her reaction is disproportionate and unjustified. However perhaps I feel this way because I have a ridiculous relative who is offended by everything all of the time when it comes to a few select people. They will happily except exactly the same behaviour from other people. The hypocrisy, paranoia, double standards and unjustified nastiness are unbearable.\n\nHowever while your wife sounds in the wrong to me, what triggered her in the first place? People who do this usually have deep underlying issues built on some trauma, which often has nothing to do with their victim, you need to find out what is setting her off so that it can be addressed.", "Literally every example you gave make me believe your brother is an unclassy, snob, who lacks the ability to understand that some things should not be said. And rather than double down he should apologize. YTA so is your brother, so is BIL, and I hope your wife leaves you when she learns you and your brother share the same views as you say in your post and comments", "So far all you have provided are instances of your brother and brother in law being condescending, privileged assholes. Your wife does not \"see the worst\" in your brother, she is simply the only one who calls him out on his insufferable behavior that doesn't happen to bother *you*. Considering you both come from the same economic background, it seems pretty clear why you can't see how gouache and off-putting his behavior is. YTA.", "How would it be any different than someone saying \"I'm going to McDonalds for my birthday\" and you offering \"McDonalds? How about I take you out to a proper restaurant?\"\nSure, you can get offended... But I don't think you have to, nor do I think it's definitely intended to be offensive.", "I like his brother more than his wife. Someone who is determined to be offended over nothing is pretty unbearable.", "Yeah, I was ready to come in hot for the brother, but the more I here, the more I'm not liking OP's wife.", "He was hosting, it was getting cold out, and she was the only one wearing short sleeves. I do kind things for people I'm not 100% fond of all the time. I don't think this is all that out of the ordinary.", "Right! OP is clearly leaving out the necessary context.", "I do kind things for folks who drive me nuts in an attempt to build a relationship with them. I can totally see this interaction happening in my friend group.", "She doesn't. She would politely correct me and we will discuss the matter.", "What? Getting homesick on a vacation is normal. If she's ever been out of her home for more than a week she would know this. \n\nI don't see any way that makes his brother a classiest asshole. \n\nI grew up super poor, like malnutrition & emotional abuse poor. I still understand that when you leave home you can get homesick. Maybe \"you know how it is\" is a poor choice of words but that's it. Certainly not worth causing drama over. \nHow easy would it have been for her to be like, I don't really know how it is. What do you mean? Or some equally intelligent way of diffusing the situation and calling attention to it."]}
