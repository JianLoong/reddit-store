My husband is keeping the house, so I had to find a new place to live. We're splitting custody of Megan. \n\nThis transition has been  very, very hard, and I just feel awful for my children particularly Megan as she is still a child at home. I don't have much money right now, so when looking for a place I had to downsize considerably. I found a nice two bedroom condo that is still in the same school district. I can't afford a big house like the one I shared with my ex, plus to be quite honest I don't want the responsibility of caring for a big house all on my own assuming that Megan will be presumably moving out in the next 5 years or so. I thought this was very normal and straight forward, but Sam is very upset.\n\nSam lives in an apartment about 25 min away with his wife. I did not factor him into my home search, as he is not reliant on me for housing like his sister is. Sam accused me of favoritism, and said he felt deeply wounded that I was making a new life that didn't have space for him. He wants me to find a house where he can have his own dedicated room like his sister has (like he has at his father's house as his childhood bedroom remains intact). I feel gutted that he feels this way, but I am at a loss because I just don't think it is reasonable. I have a pullout sofa and room for him to stay anytime he likes, but not a dedicated bedroom for him. I think he feels upset that I have invested so much time & money into Megan's needs during this time, but not into him. I do not doubt this divorce is hard on him, but I really do think it's been harder on his sister as her home life is changing and Sam has his own home with his wife now.

My thinking was that Megan doesn't have a lot to be excited for at my new home, so I wanted to let her get to decorate it with more freedom than I would allow otherwise and and a bigger budget (I wouldn't have replaced Megan's bedroom furniture if we hadn't gotten divorced, her stuff at her dad's house is all functional so she would have had to earn the money to buy a whole new bed set, but I couldn't take that stuff with me so she did need a new bed, bedside table, desk, etc). So I do feel like I have been focused on Megan far more than Sam this year.\n\nBut to be fair when Sam got married two years ago we spent far more money and time on him than on Megan, of course, planning the wedding.

If anything, you owe her more now!\n\nSee how ridiculous that is?  He's being sensitive in a delicate situation, but that doesn't make you the asshole.", "I would tell him that the furniture is an investment in the house and in several years the room will become a guest room and no longer belong to either child. It\u2019s not entirely a gift to her unless the style is so specific that it can\u2019t be used later by guests.", "He should be fine with you spending more money on Megan than him every year in general. He is an adult who can buy whatever he wants for himself and all his needs. Megan cannot.", "He's an adult.  An ADULT.  You are supposed to grow out of expecting big gifts from your parents.\n\nYou're doing right by your daughter, who is still a minor, dependant child.\n\nYour son is acting like he's five.  NTA.", "That, and maybe start some kind of new tradition that connects Sam to your new home, even if it's something as simple as a monthly dinner, or a regular movie amd drinks night with just him when your daughter is at her dad's. It sounds like he's feeling kind of uprooted and scared about all the changes too, even though he's not technically a kid.", "He may also be feeling insecure because he\u2019s the boy, and therefore if he thinks of himself as being like his dad - his primary role model. He might feel that you and his dad splitting up and having some difficult/negative feelings towards one another will mean you also have negative feelings towards him as the most dad-like of your kids. And if you\u2019ve had little emotional energy for dealing with anything but the bare essentials recently and he\u2019s more independent then he may think he sees evidence of that in your behaviour when really it\u2019s not the case at all.", "There comes a certain point in your life when you have to acknowledge that if you return to your parent's house, you are a guest, not an occupant. I wasn't planning on ever moving back into their house, I saw no reason why my parents should keep my bedroom. I don't need a shrine to my childhood.", "I think it\u2019s really nice he has his childhood bedroom and all, but this \u201cspace for adults who don\u2019t live at home any more\u201d trend has gotten a little out of hand.  \n\nI know a ton of people, myself included, who moved a ton and so did our parents and haven\u2019t had a childhood bedroom in years.  We move about society pretty normally, I think.", "I would ask him if he is leaving his wife bc why does he need a room", "My parents, who were divorced at the time, both moved out of state during my Freshman year at college. Dad got a new job, mom moved to the same city so they could keep their joint custody with my younger siblings going.\n\nNEITHER of them got a four bedroom place with a room for me. Good lord. I was living in our home town going to university there. I had adequate sleeping accommodations when I went to visit them. They stored and moved some of my childhood possessions I didn't have room for. That was all I needed. Your son--who has his own house and family for God's sake!--does not need a kiddy bedroom at your house.", "Again - your son is a grown ass man with his own home and wife. He needs to grow up. If he hasn\u2019t gotten over \u201cbeing a big brother\u201d by now, I feel sorry for his wife. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re doing anything to coddle or overcompensate for him, but  if you are, stop it.\n\nAnd you ARE prioritizing a Megan over him. She a CHILD and he\u2019s a GROWN ASS MARRIED MAN", "Then he needs to take ownership and go get his things. There comes a point as an adult when you shouldn't be depending on your parents to be your storage solution.", "Oh lord, I am so not ready to even think about my ex getting remarried but I hear you", "Yes, I did try to point out that Megan's whole life it's been split between her and Sam, but for the first ten years of his life everything was spent on him, but I think he's just always felt like since Megan was born we've focused a lot of time and attention on her. Babies just need a lot more than teens, so he's been second fiddle for a bit.", "My parents ended up upsizing instead of downsizing due to their financial situation improving, so they do actually have a bedroom for me. However, it would double as a guest room if anyone else ever stayed over, it just happens to have my stuff that I left there in it/the closet. I can't imagine demanding a dedicated room if they had to downsize into a house with 2 bedrooms even if no one else was living with them", ">Exactly, this attitude is okay for a five year old not a 23 yr old.  \n>  \n>And OP--your son got to spend money to decorate his whole blinking apartment the way he(and his wife) wanted.  Why shouldn't your daughter get same opportunity for her bedroom?  \n>  \n>Since you mention in comments you put time/money into his wedding, that likely helped him be able to afford furniture for his apartment.   He really really needs to grow up and get over himself.  \n>  \n>Tho I agree with other redditorss, that spending some extra time with him wouldn't hurt(ie if your daughter is up to a sleepover at friends home, maybe he can come over and you two spend some time one-on-one).", "Does your husband even have that type of sentimental attachment to your kids' rooms as you do? \n\nI mean, the reality is that if your ex keeps their rooms the way they are, it's likely because he's too lazy to clear them out. Divorces where the guy keeps the family house ... the family house either gets trashed quickly and thoroughly and ages poorly because he's not taking care of it, or gets pretty much cleared out because the guy doesn't want all that junk around. \n\nI would be concerned about your daughter's stuff, to be honest. The fact you said that all her things and memories are there--that's not good. Half her stuff should be moved to her room at your place, and I would personally advise her to keep careful track of those things which are particularly sentimental to her.", "He's 23 and married now though - he needs to put on his big boy pants.", "Oh, my ex is a good housekeeper honestly, and a good dad, I'm not worried about that part of it. He's the one who felt stronger about leaving Sam's bedroom available for him. \n\nMy daughter has moved some stuff to my place, but it's all so fresh we haven't fully settled yet. I'm not sure how much sense it makes to move things like her old toys she doesn't use anymore over, things like that. I have most of the sentimental stuff- the kids art projects, etc I've been encouraging Megan to make her new bedroom like a more grown up one, as opposed to one with remnants of her childhood like her other bedroom is. She seems more comfortable with that- seeing this new place as a new chapter vs trying to recreate the feel of her old bedroom. That's why I splurged on new furniture that was to her more mature taste- the stuff at her dad's is more little girlish.", "If my grown adult husband was demanding to have \"his own room\" at his mother's new home, I'd be googling divorce lawyers. OP is saving his marriage by not treating him like a minor child.", "Definitely \"a good housekeeper\", if he's keeping the house.", "oh boy...laughing through the tears now haha"]}
