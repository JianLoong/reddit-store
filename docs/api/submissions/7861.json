My husband is keeping the house, so I had to find a new place to live. We're splitting custody of Megan. \n\nThis transition has been  very, very hard, and I just feel awful for my children particularly Megan as she is still a child at home. I don't have much money right now, so when looking for a place I had to downsize considerably. I found a nice two bedroom condo that is still in the same school district. I can't afford a big house like the one I shared with my ex, plus to be quite honest I don't want the responsibility of caring for a big house all on my own assuming that Megan will be presumably moving out in the next 5 years or so. I thought this was very normal and straight forward, but Sam is very upset.\n\nSam lives in an apartment about 25 min away with his wife. I did not factor him into my home search, as he is not reliant on me for housing like his sister is. Sam accused me of favoritism, and said he felt deeply wounded that I was making a new life that didn't have space for him. He wants me to find a house where he can have his own dedicated room like his sister has (like he has at his father's house as his childhood bedroom remains intact). I feel gutted that he feels this way, but I am at a loss because I just don't think it is reasonable. I have a pullout sofa and room for him to stay anytime he likes, but not a dedicated bedroom for him. I think he feels upset that I have invested so much time & money into Megan's needs during this time, but not into him. I do not doubt this divorce is hard on him, but I really do think it's been harder on his sister as her home life is changing and Sam has his own home with his wife now.

I did try to point out to him once that Megan has never gotten to be an only child with undivided attention from us so at least he had that experience, but I think he just took it as yet again me prioritizing Megan over him.

Which I do feel sorry for.", "You know that's a really good point- Megan is getting counseling services through her school, and her dad and I are discussing whether to expand that. Sam isn't in school and doesn't have that support, maybe I can suggest to him to look into an EAP or something.", "I couldn't fit this into the post, but I did need to buy Megan all new bedroom furniture and I let her splurge a bit which cut into the overall christmas budget. My thinking was that Megan doesn't have a lot to be excited for at my new home, so I wanted to let her get to decorate it with more freedom than I would allow otherwise and and a bigger budget (I wouldn't have replaced Megan's bedroom furniture if we hadn't gotten divorced, her stuff at her dad's house is all functional so she would have had to earn the money to buy a whole new bed set, but I couldn't take that stuff with me so she did need a new bed, bedside table, desk, etc). So I do feel like I have been focused on Megan far more than Sam this year.\n\nBut to be fair when Sam got married two years ago we spent far more money and time on him than on Megan, of course, planning the wedding. In my opinion kids stuff doesn't always even out perfectly, you just try to give what they need, but I think because Sam is so much older he feels like Megan has needed more than him for most of her life and just feels left out.", "Thank you, that is really good advice, I will see if I can invest more time in him whether that will help.", "Is your ex really just going to let the house sit, and letting Sam's bedroom age away as the years pass? \n\nThat's really weird.
