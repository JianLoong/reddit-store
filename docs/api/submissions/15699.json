{"id": 15699, "submission_id": "12z41qi", "title": "AITA for arguing with my wife over her attitude towards our daughter?", "selftext": "I (28f) and my wife (29f) and my daughter (7) have been living together since my wife and I had our daughter at 21 and 22. We are married by common law, so we haven\u2019t had a ceremony. We thought it would be too expensive so we decided to just buy a cake instead. Last year, though, we decided to spend some extra money on a tablet for our daughter. She was ecstatic and soon got very into piano. One day when she was on her tablet, she found Rush E. for those who don\u2019t know, Rush E is an insanely impossible sheet of music created by Music Sheet Boss. When I say impossible, I don\u2019t mean really hard, I mean **impossible**. I recommend listening to the original video to fully understand what I\u2019m saying. She got super into it and eventually stumbled across a cover of someone playing Rush E by hand (the original thing is computer generated, I\u2019m pretty sure). She immediately ran to us to show us. Now, something you have to understand about our daughter is that she is very antisocial. She\u2019s been diagnosed with ADHD, meaning she also hyper fixates a lot. When someone shuts her down when she\u2019s trying to show them something she\u2019s passionate about, she gets very quiet and embarrassed. My wife knows this about our daughter. When our daughter to the kitchen where we were sitting, she immediately started to explain and then hit play. My wife scoffed and said it was too late for that. She told our daughter it wasn\u2019t that impressive, and that she needed to go to bed. I countered this and asked our daughter how long the video was. She shyly responded that it was only about two minutes but apologized and said that she would get ready. I told her it was okay and that she could show us since it was really short and that I was actually really interested to see it. My wife took her tablet and told her she needed to go get ready. I sighed in defeat. After our daughter left, I turned to my wife and asked her why she did that.\n\nWife: It\u2019s late and I don\u2019t really want to watch something like that because it\u2019s boring.\n\nMe: You know she\u2019s sensitive to being shut down, though. It was only two minutes.\n\nWife: I don\u2019t want to argue. Just drop it.\n\nMe: Part of being a good parents is enduring things you don\u2019t really want to. She\u2019s only seven, wife.\n\nShe stormed off to our room, leaving me alone in the kitchen. I went upstairs to my daughter\u2019s room first and asked her to show she the video quickly, because I was really genuinely interested in seeing it. She shyly showed me it and I expressed how cool it was. We had a conversation about it for a bit, and she then went to bed. I took a deep breath and went to my and my wife\u2019s room. My wife was angrily laying on our bed. She called me a butthole for countering her and told me I should listen to her. I told her I understood but our daughter\u2019s feelings mattered too. My mom told me I was in the right, but my friend told me I should apologize to my wife for going against her. So, Reddit, AITA?\n\n\nEdit 1: Ok, I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to have a talk with my wife to see if there\u2019s something dressing her to make her behave this way, or if we simply need to address how to support our kid. For those asking, she only sometimes behaves this way, but it isn\u2019t a day to day experience. I love my wife with all my heart, but I think I need to talk to her instead of ignoring it.

I regret that deeply as an adult.\n\nIt was a 2 minute video and frankly, your daughter may spend much longer thinking and worrying about your wife reaction, instead of sleeping. By acting that way, your wife may have just instilled some new reluctancy in your daughter and I don't blame you for being angry", "NTA at all, good for you for sticking up for your child's interests. Shame on your wife for writing off something your daughter was excited about as \"boring\". News flash for your wife- most parents don't go to their children's ballet recitals or orchestra concerts because they think it's the most exciting thing in the world. The best thing you can ever do for a kid is nurture their interests, and your wife needs to get her head out of her butt.", "NTA, but your wife sure is. That's definitely going to hit hard as your daughter grows older. If your wife doesn't fix this attitude by then, your daughter will eventually stop talking to her.", "NTA - Always advocate for your child\u2019s needs and feelings to be respected in the home because they need to feel they are a valued part of the family. It sounds like your wife has a hard time controlling her emotions and maybe you can sit down and address it with her? I think marriage is a whole lot easier when both partners invite each other to come to them without blame to address concerns. This is a fault in her that you have seen has hurt your kid\u2019s emotions and, assuming she wants to avoid things like that in the future, seeing things through your eyes can help her. Be kind since she could feel guilt with you bringing up her being unreasonable but be sure to make sure your daughter gets her own conversation about it. I think it would improve things leaps and bounds if she got a kind apology from her mother.", "NTA. Your wife\u2019s reasoning didn\u2019t have anything to do with bedtime, she just didn\u2019t want to invest the two minutes into something daughter was into because she finds it boring (without having seen it??)\n\nYour wife is definitely the A H. She lost an opportunity to bond with her daughter and encourage her excitement to learn.", "NTA. Your wife was having a bad day and took it out on her family.", "NTA\n\nDoes your wife frequently try to go all \u201cwhat I say goes\u201d like that and decide what and when y\u2019all will discuss things or was she just having a bad day? Because everything about her side of the interaction seems.. off and pretty asshole-y, tbh.\n\nRejection sensitivity dysphoria is such a massive PITA to deal with, but it sounds like you\u2019re doing a good job of working around it.\n\nEdit: just watched that Rush E video, and am now fighting the urge to get sucked into a rabbit hole of similar videos. Your daughter\u2019s right, it\u2019s really cool, tell her thanks for the opportunity to learn about this new (to me) thing!", "NTA. My mom was like this towards me mg entire childhood & still like this towards me now. It\u2019s very disheartening. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re supportive & showing interest in your daughter\u2019s hobbies.", "NTA.  If you're a butthole for supporting your daughter's healthy interests I think you should totally keep being a butthole dad.", "NTA. And why does your marriage include the dynamic of having your wife speak to you in such a consistently shitty way?", "NTA.

Your wife doesn\u2019t sound like mother or wife material.", "INFO: Is your wife consistently like that towards your daughter, or was this incident isolated? Also, do you mean \"antisocial\" as in APD (and therefore requiring strict enforcement of rules) or just colloquially, as in she's shy? \n\nNTA for encouraging your daughter's interests. On one hand, I understand your wife's issue because it sounds like there's a developing (or already developed?) good-cop/bad-cop dynamic where one parent indulges and the other is firm about things like bedtime. Parents should generally strive to present a united front. On the other hand, it is just two minutes and I'm concerned more with your wife's dismissal of your daughter's interests. When things are better, maybe you should discuss how to approach similar situations in the future. One of my kids has ADHD, too, and it's always been a struggle to wind him down for bed (especially if he sees something online that HAS to be explained NOW), so the no gadgets by 8:00 p.m. rule has been a big help.", "Info:  why the info about not having a wedding?  What does that do for the story?", "NTA\n\nBruh, I teach kindergarten just 1 hour per day and even I try to listen to whatever nonsense the kids try to tell me. \n\nIt's important for them to feel heard, even if you don't particularly care about it.
