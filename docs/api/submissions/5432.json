We share a dad. He was a widower when he met my mom. My half sister did not take kindly to my mom marrying dad and I think she has always seen it as they betrayed her in some way. She always, always saw me as less than a sister. She's 10 years older so there's some of that going on as well but in general, she just doesn't care about being family and told me numerous times we're not real siblings because we only have one parent in common. She also told me she hates my mom and that also makes me less her sibling, because she wouldn't want some random woman's kid being passed off as her family.\n\nSo she's married now, to a guy with kids (shocked the hell out of me to learn this given her feelings) and she called me up to talk for the first time in over 18 months to say she was going to my parents for Christmas and wanted to tell me to get her stepkids gifts. I had no plans to go to my parents for Christmas and so I told her I got no gifts for the kids and would not get them. She starts freaking out on the phone, told me I'm useless to her more than she ever realized, how I should be putting the kids before all else.. blah blah blah. I told her she cannot expect me to buy for kids I never met who I won't be seeing for Christmas. I ended up hanging up on her because she was ready to keep going indefinitely and I have no time for that. We're not sisters, per her own decision, and so I don't need to care if she's married with kids, or stepkids.\n\nMy mom called and told me they heard what happened, that my half sister is still seething and she asked me if I'd even get them some small gifts to make things easier. She said my half sister is having a hard time getting close to her stepkids and we could maybe help by showing them they're wanted and included in our family. I told her it has been made clear to me I am not part of her family. Mom said she knows but we could always hope that those relationships will improve. That she still loves her despite always being treated like she was an affair partner rather than the woman who met a widower and married him.\n\nMy sister even sent me a DM to rant at me and told me I am being an asshole to the kids.\n\nAITA here?\n\nETA just for clarity: By saying my half sister treats my mom like she's the affair partner, etc. I don't think my half sister needs to treat her like a parent or even like the closest of family members. But even some respect and civility isn't too much to ask for after 24 years, I would think.", "created_utc": 1671781700, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt9mpd/aita_for_not_buying_my_half_sisters_stepkids/", "score": 815, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have made it clear that I am not your sister and that you do not want that kind of relationship with me, so why would you wish me to act as an aunt to your step-kids?\n\nI'm especially confused as you said step-families ruin children's lives.

I am curious about your logic, though: when my mother was the step-parent, step-parents were awful and children would be better off without them. However, now you are the step-parent, step-parents are acceptable and important. Could you explain your logic? And did your husband know your stance on step-parenting before he married you?\n\nUltimately, there will be no presents. You have never wanted to be a family, and I will not pretend to be one for you now. If your husband finds this offensive, I will be happy to explain it to him. I would like to think that you would reconsider your stance and apologise to my mother given how your current situation is similar to the one she found herself in when she entered your life, but I doubt you will.

You say you've never expected her to treat your mom as a mom and she still treats your mom as an affair partner and clearly still treats you the same.  My guess is she's never told her husband how shitty she is to you and your mom.  If I knew she still treated her half sister like this I wouldn't want her as a stepparent to my kids.  She's afraid her husband will learn she isn't who she says she is if you don't send gifts and for whatever reason your mom is willing to cover for her.\n\nDon't send a damn thing.

Buy them annoying toys or don't buy them anything.\n\nImagine being the poor kid, with no skin in the game, opening a fucking paper clip for Christmas.", "Sounds like something she should've taken up with her dad. Y'all were a choice HE made.", "The Lord works in mysterious ways. I bet she pregnant! I HOPE she's pregnant. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd Probably why she's so desperate for acceptance.\n\nNTA\n\nTell Desperate Delilah she's shit outta luck.", "She did, but we were the ones she didn't love or like, so we got the worst of it.", "I don't think she's pregnant. I have a feeling she's been saying she'd be a great step-muk because she has a step-mum and has a great relationship with her, and she has half-sister and they are great, and so she'll be the perfect step-mum and can blend the family perfectly. \n\nOP not buying presents screws her lies up. The husband will ask why OP didn't buy presents if she and half-sister are so close. It would explain why she freaked out when OP said no about presents, and why she called OP useless: she can't use OP to prop up her lies and play happy families, so OP isn't of use to her.", "Well I guess it's just meant for her to feel some of what she put you and your mother through. Although she probably feels it isn't the same. Your mother is too nice. I wouldn't do a thing to help her. Seems like she still has the same attitude.", "It could be. I don't know. He would've had to have questions about why he hasn't met her throughout their whole relationship and in to the marriage. I don't know how long they've been together. \n\nI was hoping for a pregnancy. Her being in the same situation as OP and her mother even though she probably doesn't see it the same way since she's the step parent in this situation and how can they not love her.", "OP was busy and has her own life, but they're still really close would be her excuse. \n\nA pregnancy would be amusing, except that the half-sister clearly can't see the parallels between her situation and the situation with OP's mum. \n\nI think she's playing games and doesn't realise that it will all come out eventually.", "Thank you. That was what I said in a previous comment. I would call the husband and make sure the kids aren't expecting presents or an aunty, because I think the half sister has been telling lies. \n\nI also think the husband needs to know who he's married. If step-siblings and half-siblings don't exist, how is she going to treat the step-kids, especially if they don't warm up to her, and how is she going to treat them if she has kids with the husband? Also, will she teach her biological kids to hate their step-siblings? The guy needs to know.", " *I have never met her stepkids, I was not invited to her wedding, and we have never been close,*\n\n**She's basically an acquaintance that you know through your parents,** who has avoided you most of your life?

For your mom?  For you?  For your dad?  If they want to get gifts for the kids, you aren't stopping them.**  They can do that for themselves.  What they do at a party you aren't going to isn't your concern.\n\nWhy is this important to her, that *you* give these gifts to her stepkids?  She's playing some game?\n\n*I told her it has been made clear to me I am not part of her family.* \n\nSo, **for years, you aren't family to her.

What's changed?**  The lies she told her new spouse?  You have money and she doesn't?  **She needs something, and somehow has assigned you a role in this production she's trying to stage.**\n\nShe's wrong.  **You aren't the one being TA.  She is.**  She's demanding that you play happy families with her, now that she wants it for some reason of her own, after years of her demanding that you aren't her family and won't be.  **She's being very controlling, very manipulative, very demanding here.**  \n\n**You do not owe her anything at all.**  Not gifts.  Not cards.  Not showing up to events because she wants and demands it.  Nothing.  If she can't treat you with kindness and respect, **you do not owe her answers to her messages or answering her calls or having conversations about this new role she wants you to play for her.** You do not have to discuss this with her again. \n\nShe sounds like a person that you are better off not having a relationship with, if her behaviors are always like this.  Might want to check out r/JUSTNOFAMILY if you need help protecting yourself from her behaviors.  Until then, **maybe just take a break from her messages, until sometime in January**?
