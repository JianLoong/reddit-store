{"id": 5432, "submission_id": "zt9mpd", "title": "AITA for not buying my half sister's stepkids anything for Christmas?", "selftext": "I should start this off with, I have never met her stepkids, I was not invited to her wedding, and we have never been close, her and I. We share a dad. He was a widower when he met my mom. My half sister did not take kindly to my mom marrying dad and I think she has always seen it as they betrayed her in some way. She always, always saw me as less than a sister. She's 10 years older so there's some of that going on as well but in general, she just doesn't care about being family and told me numerous times we're not real siblings because we only have one parent in common. She also told me she hates my mom and that also makes me less her sibling, because she wouldn't want some random woman's kid being passed off as her family.\n\nSo she's married now, to a guy with kids (shocked the hell out of me to learn this given her feelings) and she called me up to talk for the first time in over 18 months to say she was going to my parents for Christmas and wanted to tell me to get her stepkids gifts. I had no plans to go to my parents for Christmas and so I told her I got no gifts for the kids and would not get them. She starts freaking out on the phone, told me I'm useless to her more than she ever realized, how I should be putting the kids before all else.. blah blah blah. I told her she cannot expect me to buy for kids I never met who I won't be seeing for Christmas. I ended up hanging up on her because she was ready to keep going indefinitely and I have no time for that. We're not sisters, per her own decision, and so I don't need to care if she's married with kids, or stepkids.\n\nMy mom called and told me they heard what happened, that my half sister is still seething and she asked me if I'd even get them some small gifts to make things easier. She said my half sister is having a hard time getting close to her stepkids and we could maybe help by showing them they're wanted and included in our family. I told her it has been made clear to me I am not part of her family. Mom said she knows but we could always hope that those relationships will improve. That she still loves her despite always being treated like she was an affair partner rather than the woman who met a widower and married him.\n\nMy sister even sent me a DM to rant at me and told me I am being an asshole to the kids.\n\nAITA here?\n\nETA just for clarity: By saying my half sister treats my mom like she's the affair partner, etc. I don't think my half sister needs to treat her like a parent or even like the closest of family members. But even some respect and civility isn't too much to ask for after 24 years, I would think.", "created_utc": 1671781700, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt9mpd/aita_for_not_buying_my_half_sisters_stepkids/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the end of it all, and maybe why I need to ask this in the first place, they're kids, and they will be around my parents and maybe eventually I will see them somewhere and they'll know I exist. So maybe I should try to think about the potential for that. Maybe I should get them something just because they're kids.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're not obligated to buy gifts for anyone let alone children you've never met. \nYour sister is now reaping the consequences of her poor behaviour and treatment towards you. It's a delicious irony that she treated your mother so badly and is now having the same issue. \nYour sister is rotten.", "NTA. You don't owe them shit", "NTA. Your half sister calls you after a year and half of NC just to tell you to buy gifts for her step kids? The audacity is astonishing. You don\u2019t owe them, or her, anything.

OP you're NTA.", "While I feel bad for the kids having your fathers other child as their step mother, I wouldn't buy gifts for them either... she's made it perfectly clear that you're not her family amd to ask you to \"fake\" being her family to get those kids to like her is lying to the kids. If you feel compelled at all to get the kids something, get them something (a board game-ish type thing) that the stepmother hates to play, but I'm petty like that. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Half sister is bonkers.  She has shown herself to be rude, entitled and disrespectful.  There is nothing that you can do to overcome her animosity.  Stick to your guns.  If I were there, I'd be cheering you on.  Best wishes. Merry Christmas (as much as possible, considering). :-)", "NTA she made the decision years ago she doesnt get to demand her way now. She has shown who she is, dont give into her demands. Your mam can make her own decisions but should respect your choice to stay away.\n\nBlock sister it's not worth it to even see the vitriol shes spewing. \n\nShe made her bed now she can lie in it.", "NTA and you need to go NC with the \"sister\".", "NTA. If you were going to be there or there were other kids that would be opening gifts from you in front of them, I'd say to get them something. But you're not even going to meet them. It's a gift, supposedly from  a phantom relative; that's not going to make them feel connected and welcome.", "NTA. \n\nIt is not fair to call someone and give an order to buy a gift, especially if this person is someone that you have been treating like shit. I dont think she would respond like that if she has good intention to make your relationship better", "NTA, your sister told you point-blank you\u2019re not her family. She can\u2019t have her cake and eat it too. Your mom is enabling her, it might be because she wants to mend their relationship, but that\u2019s her decision, not yours. The only people interested in \u201ckeeping the peace\u201d are tyrants and their enablers. Enjoy your Christmas away from your toxic half-sister, I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s harassing you", "NTA\n\nThose are not your kids. Yes, they are kinda technically your nieces and nephews, but you have never met them. The way you half-sister treats you,  I don't see how she can expect you to be so willing to do anything for her. If your parents are so keen on this, they can purchase all the gifts they want.", "NTA but if you want a great revenge get something that makes a lot of noise, or a huge mess and say you can't wait to see a video of them playing with it. Squirt guns for indoor use would also be a great gift idea for your worthless step sister. But really as someone suggested just block her.", "NTA and not your problem that your half sister is having a hard time getting close with her step kids. No, do not buy these kids any gifts unless you really want to. This thing where people should be made to feel obligated to treat someone's kids special by buying them gifts is getting out of hand. Would you buy a stranger a gift? No. \n\nPeople can't pick and chose when they want someone in their life out of convenience and necessity. She's never treated any of you like family and now she thinks she can buy people's love. How sad and pathetic.", "NTA. that\u2019s it. This shit is appalling to me.", "NTA: She doesn't consider you her sister/family so why the hell does she expect you to buy her step kids gifts? In your shoes I'd reply to her DM to bugger off and never contact you again until she is ready to apologize.", "Get them all drum sets.", "NTA\n\nShe's been far from nice your whole life, and now she wants your help in making her step kids feel welcome. It's not your job, it's not your responsibility\n\nShe sounds insufferable", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t/doesn\u2019t care for you, she shouldn\u2019t care for your money. Those are her step-kids and if they don\u2019t like her, OH WELL. Now, she\u2019ll maybe finally see where she was in the wrong growing up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
