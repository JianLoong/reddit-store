Two years ago when my daughter was a newborn (around 2 months old) my husband and I decided to move 5 hours away from where we were living at the time. Keep in mind, I was a first time mom to a newborn, my husband was working around 60 hours per week , and my 17 (at the time) year old stepdaughter was also living with us. \n\nI did ALL of the cooking, cleaning, and childcare with the exception of my husband\u2019s laundry. My stepdaughter didn\u2019t even do anything around the house. The only time she ever left her room was to get food, pile dishes in the sink, shower, or leave to see friends. And she wasn\u2019t in school. \n\nWhen we moved, my MIL offered to do our moving out deep clean so that the landlord wouldn\u2019t take it out of our deposit as stipulated in our lease. So my husband went with her to help. But the whole time they were there I kept getting snarky texts from her saying things like \u201cwhen was the last time you took a sponge to the radiators\u201d or \u201cwhen was the last time you moved the couch to vacuum\u201d. Look, my house wasn\u2019t dirty or unhygienic. But moving a couch while I was pregnant or managing a newborn wasn\u2019t going to happen. I kept the house clean, but the little deep cleaning things were let go from about the time I was 8.5 months pregnant. \n\nFast forward to now, I\u2019m 6.5 months pregnant and I spend my day wrangling a toddler, cleaning the house, cooking etc. My stepdaughter no longer lives with us so it\u2019s just me, my husband, and our daughter. My husband helps with some things like taking out the garbage and grocery shopping now since we don\u2019t live close enough for me to walk to the store like we used to (I don\u2019t drive). My husband told me the other day that his mom said she would like to come down a few weeks before the baby is due to do a deep clean as a baby gift for us. \n\nHonestly, the thought makes me so anxious and uncomfortable. I just imagine her never ending snarky comments and it really doesn\u2019t seem worth it to me. I keep the house clean and while it would be great to have a good, deep cleaning done before we bring home another baby, I just feel like it would stress me out.

Nor your opinion of yourself - you know how clean your house is or isn\u2019t, you know how long it\u2019s been since you\u2019ve vacuumed under the couch or the coils behind the refrigerator. \n\nMany parents find the arrival of the second child to be more stressful than the first. You may not so I\u2019m not trying to predict or warn you of that, but I did. I was really struggling and in retrospect assume I was also dealing with PPD. I have a SIL that is more than a little abrasive and she and I don\u2019t connect especially well; she and BIL are the only local family. When my infant became very ill she realized I was in crisis and came over and cleaned my whole house top to bottom. I came to love her for that. I didn\u2019t know how badly I needed that. She\u2019s still abrasive, she and I will never be besties, but many years later I still see her through the filter that began that day. I\u2019ll always have her back if she needs me. \n\nI would accept the cleaning. Let her talk, keep it in perspective, and laugh about it later.", "NTA gifts with strings attached are not gifts. She will get the message and maybe she will begin to think before speaking / texting.", "I\u2019d ask if the gift comes with snarky comments, if so then you don\u2019t want it.", "She can direct her texts to her son instead. Son, why haven't you scrubbed the radiators? Son, why haven't you moved the couch and vacuumed underneath? \n\nLeave you out of it. You grow and birth humans, then provide round the clock care for them. Cut yourself some slack.", "Nta. Why don't you follow him around and bitch to him about every little thing he does wrong like his mommy does, and when he complains you can point out that's exactly what you deal with and you don't want her around.", "HAH! I just bet she wants to\u2026 just so she can get her jollies by being snarky and trying to shame you.\n\nPolitely decline, don\u2019t let either of them push you into it. NTA", "NTA. She raised her son to not be a contributor in his own household which he then passed on to his daughter. I\u2019d have said \u201cnot sure, why don\u2019t you ask your son the last time he helped around here.. oh wait you raised him to be a slob\u201d", "Can she clean while you\u2019re not there so you don\u2019t have to hear her comments?", "NTA. But you might have better luck redirecting her. Could you ask her to come and help you do a cooking binge to stock the freezer with lasagna or something? That way she's helping, but isn't snarking about your radiators \n\nAlso, fwiw, my kid is 14 and under my couch is gross and I don't know if I've ever taken a sponge to the radiators because it isn't 1950 and I don't define my value by the cleanliness of my home", "Just suck it up and let her clean, have a relaxing bath or something", "NTA", "Gee why does she \u201creally want\u201d to do that in particular especially if it won\u2019t help you? \n\nHe needs to sort himself out. No, she can\u2019t come and clean in order to make snarky remarks \n\nYour husband did not and does not contribute adequately to household cleaning.", "NTA\n\nMy personal response to this would be, \"Oh H\\_\\_\\_ No!\"", "NTA \n\nAs someone who's MIL ran her finger along the top of some cabinets when she was here once....don't let her come. Everything you are thinking will happen WILL happen.", "NTA, but what if you took her up on it and told your husband that he needed to take you out somewhere for a nice relaxation day so that you don't have to listen to the nasty commentary?", "This is so well-said and honestly the main thing is to not let her comments get to you. You're pregnant! You have a toddler! Of course there are dusty corners in your house. When she asks about the radiators, just say \"I'm so busy with caring for toddler and trying to have a healthy pregnancy, I definitely have not thought about wiping down the radiators or vacuuming under the sofa. It's such a great help that you are here!\" And then rinse and repeat. \"Pregnancy makes it hard to get behind the fridge, thanks for doing that!\"  \n\nThe thing that she is willing to do IS a lot of work, let her do it, let her brag about doing it. She probably doesn't have a lot of money to offer, but she does have time and elbow grease, and it's something that she can feel special for doing. Let go of any shame you might feel, it's perfectly reasonable to have dust under your sofa. Enjoy your clean house!", "I\u2019m with you! NTA but hey if you want to deep clean my house, go at it! I\u2019ll buy pizza", "She should have been concerned that she raised her son to treat the mother of his newborn kid this way", ">Maybe she should have been concerned that she didn't teach her son to contribute fairly to the household.\n\nHe works 60 hours a week. How is that not a fair contribution?!", "Totally agree, this is masterful!", "This is the way.", "Brilliant!", "Honestly I missed the 60 hours a week bit. But if they had a newborn and a teenager and she did all the cooking, cleaning, and childcare. He could have been doing things like moving the couch to vacuum underneath it. And he should have been sticking up for his wife to his mother if they were both under that much pressure.", "He also was happy for his eldest to do nothing but make more work for OP.", "Who would be cleaning if he didn't have a wife?", "This is actually not a bad idea.  And if MIL does send them, OP can forward to husband with an attached \"Per our conversation: I think this is meant for you\" note.", "How do you know he was happy about it? Is it because she no longer lives with them?", "NTA. Who cares what she wants? Just say thank you but no.", "NTA. Have u ever told DH how his mother behaved last time? You should have, but maybe you were embarrassed. Maybe now's the time. At some point you might want to hire a regular cleaner and it wouldn't help if DH kept reminding you that you wouldn't accept MIL's offer to do it for free.", "NTA. I\u2019m laughing right now because I get it. My mother in law deep cleans my house without asking and it is AGONY. She isn\u2019t critical but she is embarrassingly thorough. She sneaks in when we\u2019re on vacation and cleans the bejeezus out of everything and when I get back even my sex toys are in the dishwasher, my tampons are in Tupperware containers and she\u2019s organized my frozen breast milk by \u201ccolor\u201d and not by date. \n\nYou should just tell yourself you\u2019re doing enough. I also don\u2019t know a single normal human who moves their couch regularly to vacuum under it, much less a pregnant woman or a mother with small kids. I\u2019m too busy cleaning up poop, snot and vomit and keeping the baby from eating out of the dog food bowl.\n\nMaybe just thank her for the offer, tell her you enjoy your happy chaos because you\u2019re making memories with your toddler and refer her to your gift registry?", "NTA at all.... But just an idea - can you let her clean, but be visiting a friend when she comes over and block her number while she's cleaning? If you're able to let her commentary roll off your back (her snide comments say more about her character than yours) and not take it to heart, you get a free cleaning job for the low low price of not giving a shit what she thinks.\nBut if that's not possible, just ask her not to come \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This. OP, tell your husband to handle it, but there is ZERO chance you want your MIL at your house any time soon.", "Do you listen to podcasts? If so I think your post would fit right in with the submitted questions offered in the [Were You Rainsed By Wolves?](https://www.wereyouraisedbywolves.com/) podcast. It would be fun to hear their take on it.\n\nNTA BTW. I totally understand your anxiety at the thought of her judging you again.", "Also maybe block her number for the time she cleans your house so you don\u2019t get her judgmental texts. And you get your house cleaned. Win win!", "Even Marie Kondo the clutter guru came to that conclusion after having kids and millions were laughing about it.", "There\u2019s no compromising with nasty people.   \n\nJust say \u201cno thanks, I wouldn\u2019t want you to be concerned on our behalf.\u201d", "\u201cNo thanks, we love our happy chaos.\u201d", "I DO NOT agree with the husband in this sitch at all, but theoretically, 60 hrs a wk, no wife; guy could probably afford a house keeper right?", "Because he didn\u2019t lay down any ground rules for her to do her share of the household chores\u2026", "NTA if he really wants her to do this, how about you get a nice weekend away in a hotel or spa or something while she's there?  Otherwise, thanks but no thanks.", "NAH, so you're upset that you were called out (which I agree can be hard to take but people who are naturally inclined to clean see mess differently) previously and will hold this against her forever? \n\nIf you aren't working outside the home and no longer have your stepdaughter to blame for the mess this should be an easy yes.", "Agree you should take it. I\u2019ve found the best way to handle these passive aggressive type of people is just let it roll off your back. They\u2019re looking for a reaction, don\u2019t give one and remember it\u2019s her own issues and insecurities that are causing this behaviour. It\u2019s nothing to do with you. Take yourself out for the day while she\u2019s there, sincerely thank her for the help and enjoy your clean home. Whenever she brings up what a big job it was smile sweetly and thank her again and say something about how helpful she was while you were dealing with being pregnant. Kill her with kindness.", "It's a figure of speech.", "I think you can do whatever you are comfortable with as far as the cleaning goes.  That  being said, are you able to program your phone so that any texts from her that day get forwarded to your husband's phone without you having to manually do so?  He can see just how snarky she is when she offers to help, and understand your reluctance.", "She\u2019s looking for a reason to shame you\u2026\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhy would you invite disdain and criticism into your home.", "I have ADHD, i genuinely have had this asked out of concern. But I've had it asked out of snarkiness too. You can easily tell the difference\n\nMiL was snarky.  That's enough reason to say no.", "Because he's not vacuuming behind the couch and taking a sponge to the radiator and other things his wife is physically incapable of but his mom is going to complain about."]}
