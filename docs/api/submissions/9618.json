Two years ago when my daughter was a newborn (around 2 months old) my husband and I decided to move 5 hours away from where we were living at the time. Keep in mind, I was a first time mom to a newborn, my husband was working around 60 hours per week , and my 17 (at the time) year old stepdaughter was also living with us. \n\nI did ALL of the cooking, cleaning, and childcare with the exception of my husband\u2019s laundry. My stepdaughter didn\u2019t even do anything around the house. The only time she ever left her room was to get food, pile dishes in the sink, shower, or leave to see friends. And she wasn\u2019t in school. \n\nWhen we moved, my MIL offered to do our moving out deep clean so that the landlord wouldn\u2019t take it out of our deposit as stipulated in our lease. So my husband went with her to help. But the whole time they were there I kept getting snarky texts from her saying things like \u201cwhen was the last time you took a sponge to the radiators\u201d or \u201cwhen was the last time you moved the couch to vacuum\u201d. Look, my house wasn\u2019t dirty or unhygienic. But moving a couch while I was pregnant or managing a newborn wasn\u2019t going to happen. I kept the house clean, but the little deep cleaning things were let go from about the time I was 8.5 months pregnant. \n\nFast forward to now, I\u2019m 6.5 months pregnant and I spend my day wrangling a toddler, cleaning the house, cooking etc. My stepdaughter no longer lives with us so it\u2019s just me, my husband, and our daughter. My husband helps with some things like taking out the garbage and grocery shopping now since we don\u2019t live close enough for me to walk to the store like we used to (I don\u2019t drive). My husband told me the other day that his mom said she would like to come down a few weeks before the baby is due to do a deep clean as a baby gift for us. \n\nHonestly, the thought makes me so anxious and uncomfortable. I just imagine her never ending snarky comments and it really doesn\u2019t seem worth it to me. I keep the house clean and while it would be great to have a good, deep cleaning done before we bring home another baby, I just feel like it would stress me out. But my husband says his mom really wants to do this as her \u201cgift\u201d to us. \n\nWIBTA if I put my foot down and decline her gift?", "created_utc": 1676031209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yqgx3/wibta_if_i_declined_my_mils_big_baby_gift/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sit on the couch with your feet up & watch her clean. Make a list of things you need done. Ask her to clean stuff you never get to.

Thank you for your help\u201d Unless you\u2019re a professional designer with a show house having a messy house is no reflection on you as a person.

You're well within your rights to not accept the gift, but it may be helpful to redirect her to a different task / more appropriate gift that can make her feel helpful and needed without opening yourself up to judgement at a vulnerable time. For example, you can say you'd really appreciate if she would take your eldest/toddler out for 1-1 time with grandma so they don't feel left out/overlooked while you and newborn rest for an afternoon or two during the first few weeks. Alternatively, you can be honest with her and say that while you value her as a person / professional, you felt really judged last time she offered to do this and that you'd rather not go through that again and jeopardise your relationship over it. \n\nBoundaries are important in any relationship, your instinct to establish this boundary is a healthy one.", "Decline and tell him you don\u2019t need the judgy comments from her.
