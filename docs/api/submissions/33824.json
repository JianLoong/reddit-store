She kept complaining that I brought my (21F) girlfriend (22F) to the celebration, since she and I \u201cbarely know each other\u201d and \u201cshe is not welcome.\u201d \n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for over a year and it is not uncommon to bring guests to this annual celebration. My sister brought her high school boyfriend of only a few months last year and I\u2019ve brought friends in the past. I fully believe she complained because we are a lesbian couple. My aunt made comments about my girlfriend \u201clooking like a boy\u201d and that \u201cbecause she looks like a boy, I was so close to having a normal relationship, I almost chose right.\u201d\n\nShe also can\u2019t help but bring up the typical \u201cdon\u2019t do it around kids\u201d \u201cI hate when they make it their whole personality\u201d and \u201cI hate the whole pronouns thing\u201d\n\nMy cousins have a tradition to bring a chocolate fountain to the event, which is very popular among the kids. And because kids are messsy, they spill a lot. Naturally, they trend to spill the chocolate on the floor. So, toward the end of the night when the adults were cleaning up, my aunt and I were isolated at the dessert area and I noticed her inching toward the spilled chocolate. \n\nI knew she was going to step on it but I didn\u2019t say anything. I figured she\u2019d get some on her shoes and be annoyed and that would be it. However, she slipped and fell onto the ground and as soon as she landed she screamed at me for not helping her or stopping her from falling.\n\nI kinda think she was being dramatic and fell on purpose but regardless, she\u2019s acting like I\u2019m Tonya Harding or something in the family group chat as if I organized the whole thing. \n\nI do feel a little guilty for not saying anything, but I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t a little satisfying watching her walk out of the function with an ice bag.

You'll just get injured yourself.  Second she should have been using her eyes just like you did.  You should also be calling her out when she says this bullshit.", "NTA, deny all knowledge, it\u2019s outrageous she spent the whole night talking down on your relationship then has the nerve to scream at you.", "NTA", "Should have kicked her when she was down", "NTA.", "NTA and honestly, with some time, I think you\u2019re going to laugh at this", "NTA and my vote wouldn\u2019t change even if she was an LGBTQ+ ally lol. Be careful of your surroundings next time ma\u2019am\u2026 that\u2019s not your niece\u2019s fault", "NTA; the mess wasn\u2019t a secret. It happens yearly; she should have been paying more attention to her surroundings.", "NTA\n\nYou did not cause the karma, you were merely allowed to watch it and be amused.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have a crystal ball. Karma got her. Not you.", "Whatever- if she wasn\u2019t dreaming of people burning in hell she woulda seen it. She basically consented to falling. \n\nMore seriously- was she watching you watch her walk? Where did she actually think you could have done something? (Just checking for plausible deniability! Just blame it on shock).\n\nHonestly, go repost this on petty revenge, it\u2019s a hero level story!! NTA.", "NTA. \"Just say, I didnt notice what was happening until she was on the ground screaming at me, I was CLEANING.\" And then if anyone says anything, continue repeating a version of that. \"I was there to clean, I was cleaning.

(That the chocolate caused her fall) \nWho are you to interfere? \n\n/s\n\nNTA", "YTA -\n\nShe really could have seriously hurt herself.\n\nIf your aunt doesn't want you dating chicks, that's her choice.   What shouldn't be a choice is not informing someone before they fall and possibly being injured permanently.", "Did you aunt scream \"Why meee????\", like Nancy Kerrigan did? That would have been fantastic...", "NTA.\n\nSchadenfreude is a dish best served privately, so you did well.", "NTA\n\nWhy be kind to your enemy?

That would mean she was mistaken about something, and she sounds like the tedious sort who is **Never Wrong About Anything.

I believe you just witnessed the universe delivering some karma. I am glad you got to witness this in person. Maybe next time she will put her bigotry in check and pay attention to her surroundings. I find it amusing that she is trying to blame you for this. Darn homosexuals and their distracting agendas! She sounds like a vile woman. Try not to let her take up space in your head. Haters are going to hate and phobics are going to phobic. I am disappointed in your family though. Someone should have shut that down a long time ago and at the very least this time around.", "Karma used to come in the form of being struck by lightning or eaten by a crocodile or a tiger or bitten by a snake or falling off a cliff, but nowadays, we all live such boringly safe lives that Karma has to make do with a chocolate fountain...\n\nBit sad, really \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\n\nOP is NTA, obviously...", "The universe works in mysterious ways."]}
