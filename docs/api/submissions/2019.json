But I have teenager hormone moments where maybe I was anxious or had certain food aversions\u2014or even expected my siblings to stop doing something. Sometimes it\u2019s reasonable to be accommodating, but in this case, SHE picked the place where there\u2019s gonna be boba!

You knew it would make your sister sick. You actively ordered it knowing that anyways; that seems kind of insensitive, doesn't it?

Boba also makes my sister gag, and not only does she not insist that I never drink it in front of her, but she will stop at the boba shop if she's passing and buy me one, just because she knows I like it. On the flipside, I hate deep fried foods. The smell of fry oil makes me so sick to my stomach that if I can't get away from it, I sometimes vomit. But I make a banger coconut fried shrimp with pineapple dip, which is my sister's favorite food, and I make it for anytime she asks, even if it means I have to duck out onto the deck for fresh air between batches.

Just good banter!", "The fact is, there are two opposing societal values at play here.  Both are very important:\n\n1. We should let people do what they want.  For example, if I'm hanging out with a vegetarian, I shouldn't be barred from ordering a steak at a restaurant.\n2. We should yield some of our creature comforts for the sake of others with special needs (especially health related needs).  For example, on the train we have seats that are designated for the elderly or disabled.  Anyone can sit on them, but it's expected that if an elderly or disabled person comes on you move your butt, especially if there are no other seats available.\n\nBoth these values inherently contradict one another.  But that's where context comes in.\n\nLet's think about it this way... if you were told you couldn't have a boba, would you have started gagging reflexively?  Feared that you would get nauseous and possibly vomit?

Ordering the boba led to your sister to having a panic attack and likely made the entire meal a struggle to keep down.\n\nYou wanted a snack.\n\nYour sister wanted to not have to risk a health issue such as severe nausea or vomiting due to her pregnancy giving her weird sensory issues.\n\nThese are not two needs of equal value.

I was also more accommodating to my sister than she was to me.. maybe this is just about boba, but just in case this does end up being relevant: don\u2019t let the resentment sneak up on you like it did for me.. little sisters often just want the approval of the older one.. this is straight up me projecting, but again, just wanted to say it just in case.. the attitude of you both in these comments are giving me flashbacks..\n\nI took too long pleasing my sister without getting the same consideration back that that dynamic became the norm.. but then I got tired.. burnt out.. not even resentful yet, but I didn\u2019t know how to stop accommodating her without her perceiving it as me suddenly treating her poorly.. I didn\u2019t want her to be mad at me so I just kept accommodating her without getting the same treatment back.. still tired and still love her.. just a little resentful now..", "Well, then it doesn\u2019t seem like even she thinks you\u2019re an AH, so why are you even here?\n\nETA: almost forgot.. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "YTA. The solution is simple, if you didn\u2019t travel to the restaurant together, order to go after you have your meal.", "Info: is no one at any other table within your view having this boba?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she can not stop harassing you, stop going out to eat with her.", "NTA.. Your sister can walk away. I mean what does she do if she sees someone in public drinking boba? Like the mall or the park?", "INFO what is boba", "YTA. Unnecessary.", "NTA. You said you'd hide the boba, you did hide the boba, so what's the problem? You can't possibly be the only person in the restaurant ordering boba, so she has to occasionally be hearing about/seeing it unless she's wearing earplugs and a blindfold.", "NTA. If even \u2018mentioning\u2019 it makes her gag what the f is she doing in a place that serves it? \n\nDoes she expect that everyone will just know and not order it or talk about ordering it? \n\nShe\u2019s clearly either lying and playing it up for some reason or not that bright to go to the one place she knows serves it.", "NAH, because my best friend has thrown up pretty hard at the mere *whiff* of some things while she\u2019s been pregnant. I don\u2019t think she *can* control or *wants* to throw up that bad just to prove a point or get her way. She just has a really rough medical condition that people think is just super easy and is only really about your stomach area, but it can completely turn your body inside down and inside out. It\u2019s not fun a lot of the time and like for real a pregnant person is getting their nutrients sucked out of them and into the baby. It\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s *really* rough and your organs are getting *smushed* around and moved. It\u2019s more complicated than people want to admit because *some* have easy pregnancies and \u201cwomen have been doing this for thousands of years\u201d so it\u2019s just all the same. And it\u2019s not.", "NTA. I\u2019ve never heard of boba tea. Should I try it?", "But it's not someone. It's her sister. If you love someone, you want them to be comfortable. \n\nI don't understand reddit, sure if a pregnant stranger demanded something I would probably be annoyed, but friends and family? OP is not going to die if she orders on another day without her sister there.", "And why would she go to a place that serves something that makes her gag?", "I had that with stouffers frozen meals. Just looking at the box made me nauseous.", "My best friend projectile vomited over cottage cheese that she just got a *whiff of* while pregnant.\n\nGuess what we don\u2019t even bring up anymore?", "I love this answer. \n\n\u201cBut I wanted it\u201d\n\nDoes that mean it would be ok for your husband to fuck some cute girl???   Because he wanted it and it doesn\u2019t bother you if he keeps it hidden\u2026.\n\n\nLol.  YTA. Just order it when she\u2019s not around."]}
