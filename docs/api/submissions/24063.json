She constantly complains that she\u2019s \u201coverweight\u201d and as a result, she looks and feels disgusting and that no guy is gonna want her because of how \u201cfat and gross she is.\u201d She also said that she \u201cwould kill herself if she gained another 10lbs\u201d Jane is not overweight at all. She looks to be a healthy weight, so as a result, everyone validates her on how skinny she is. \n\nThe problem is, she insists on having this conversation when I am around despite the fact that I am visibly bigger than her. So theoretically all of the stuff about being \u201cdisgusting, fat, gross and undesirable\u201d should apply to me even more than it does to her. I understand she has the right to feel however she wants about her body, but maybe it would be better to discuss this with a therapist or around people that aren\u2019t visibly bigger than her. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to say stuff like \u201cyou know I\u2019m bigger than you, so you saying this stuff indirectly insults me.\u201d She replies with \u201coh no, you look fine, it\u2019s just my body that\u2019s huge and gross\u201d (even though I am visibly \u201cmore huge\u201d and by basic logic, \u201cmore gross\u201d) She also knows that I am 60 lbs heavier than her, and numbers don\u2019t lie. Either way, I have asked her to save the conversation for when I\u2019m not around to hear it. \n\nI know Jane is doing this to fish for compliments and validation, so when she found the opportunity to talk about it again (despite me requesting that she saves the conversation for when I\u2019m not around), I said \u201cwell you\u2019re always complaining about how big and fat you are, maybe it\u2019s time to start a diet and working out so you can lose a few pounds.\u201d She looked at me like I had 3 heads. Did I really mean it? No. But I thought maybe by getting the opposite of the response she wanted, she would stop. \n\nMy friends think it was wrong for me to do that \u201cbecause of her insecurities.\u201d I personally think having insecurities is one thing, using them to indirectly insult other people is another.

It gets exhausting to have someone say over and over that they are big/gross when fishing for compliments. At some point, everyone should just say to her, \"You know we all think you look good, but obviously you don't agree, so do something about it or stop talking about it\" \n\nDid it make her stop though?", "NTA. Obviously you did this out of frustration but she is repeatedly inviting you to talk about her weight with her, you've made it clear these conversations make you uncomfortable, and the advice you gave was good for her stated concerns (even if it was disingenuous). I don't think this was out of line considering all that.", "NTA. lmfao she can\u2019t take it? don\u2019t dish it out. i\u2019m sorry she\u2019s doing this, especially since you\u2019ve expressed how it makes you feel. \n\nsometimes you gotta say fuck it to the high road and go low. and this was hilariously low. you go dude", "NTA - I hate when people complain about things over and over instead of actually doing something about it. It gets exhausting.", "Ah yes, the compliment-fisher. My husband does this from time to time, and from time to time I say, Sweetie, you\u2019re fishing for compliments. He realizes what he\u2019s doing, and stops. Having said this, it works because he loves and trusts me, and knows that I think he\u2019s awesome. Your friend needs a glow-up. New lipstick, shoes, a pretty dress, a better haircut.", "She sounds exhausting and extremely needy. NTA everyone has limits.", "INFO: how do you know she's fishing for compliments? Do you know what body dysmorphia is and are positive she doesn't have it?", "NTA. She sounds exhausting!", "Does your friend suffer from body dysmorphia?", "NTA. Your friend is rude and should stop the indirect insults if she doesn't want you to agree with her when she says she is fat.", "ESH\n\nTake a break from hanging out with this friend.  Shit like this is exhausting and will wear you down.", "ESH. You laid your boundaries, just stick to them by not hanging out with her (instead of feeding her worst fears, no matter how insufferably fucking annoying and insulting they are to literally everyone around them.)", "This is fascinating. Neither of you are TA. You are both suffering from insecurities about your weights. I am not convinced she is \"fishing for compliments\", though. We live in the world where most of us walk around wondering if we are good enough. \n\nI can't fault you for being upset. But I assure you, if you told her to draw her outline on the wall, it would be bigger than whatever you think you are.", "ESH. You for making it about yourself, and her for presumably fishing for compliments. If you don\u2019t like it when she talks like that, you should be direct about that, and don\u2019t assume she\u2019s trying to insult you. She might just be that insecure, or sort of clueless about how talking about weight a lot tends to get tiring. Whatever the actual reason, it\u2019s reasonable to tell a friend that you\u2019re uncomfortable with the constant weight comments, and ask that she please refrain around you, you don\u2019t need to accuse her of insulting you-she might be clueless but she wasn\u2019t actually talking about you.", "ESH.  Not an expert on this, but from what I understand she may not see YOU as overweight even though she seems to perceive herself that way.  You're letting her play on your insecurities.  It's understandable that you get tired of hearing it, but remarks like that could start an eating disorder.", "I had a friend in high school that used to look in the mirror and says that she\u2019s fat when in fact she wasn\u2019t at all, while I was bigger, I thought maybe she said that indirectly to me or something, but I didn\u2019t say anything.\nA few months later, her family discovered that she had an ED. I never realized that she indeed saw herself as fat when she wasn\u2019t, so she started to not eat and starve herself. \nSo I think it is possible that she sees herself as bigger than you, and maybe she doesn\u2019t say those things because of you or with any intention of hurting you or insulting you. \nWhat you did could cause serious trouble for her. I understand your situation but as someone that was once on a similar spot, please apologize and tell her that it isn\u2019t at all the truth, explain your situation and how you feel and be aware if she seems to have another sign of an ED", "I get that it feels like an insult because you're heavier than her but she isn't talking about you (you are making it about yourself) and you don't actually get to decide what other people are allowed to talk about. Me and my cousin both have autism and when she talls about how autism sucks and how much she hates it I don't say hey, you're making me feel bad because I have autism too and mine is \"worse.\" I listen and acknowledge what was said and if I don't want to discuss it I head home and take a break from hanging out. Also your friend constantly obsessing over her weight and feeling the need to be complimented and reassured is also an issue to be concerned about. It isn't a, oh she loves attention, type of thing. It's a, she has some insecurities and hatred towards her body that causes her to constantly need validation maybe she needs therapy and support, thing. YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You know those people that starve themselves due to mental illness? You wouldn't want to take the risk that she *actually* means this stuff about herself and that arguing with her about her thoughtless comments might make her worse.\n\nI know that is a sort of dark thought, and it is possible that she's just thoughtlessly rude, but there are certainly some people who would publicly obsess over their weight for zero reason without ever intending to offend their friends. (i.e. they are way too obsessed with their problem to ever think that it is possibly hurtful or annoying to someone else)", "So far she stopped talking about it. At least around me. Not because she responded to my request of \u201csave the conversation for when I\u2019m not around.\u201d But because she knows I won\u2019t give her the response she wants anymore", "I don\u2019t think she wants to do anything about it. Nor does she have to since she\u2019s at a healthy weight for her height.

She also said that I was being inconsiderate of her insecurities when I asked her to stop. \n\n Its also hard to not take it personally when you are deeper in the pit of a quality that \u201cmakes you gross and undesirable.\u201d I also noticed that as soon as people stop giving her the response she wants, she will stop talking about it.", "She knows by the numbers that I am 60 lbs heavier than her.

I\u2019ve tried to calmly explain to her that I am not the appropriate person to talk to about this. Did not work. Her seeing herself as bigger than me is an explanation for how she feels, but not an excuse for her inconsiderate behavior", ">Also your friend constantly obsessing over her weight and feeling the need to be complimented and reassured is also an issue to be concerned about\n\n\n\nThat's what therapists are for. \n\nHow does she want Op to feel afterwards everytime she does this?", "If she has dysmorphia it's not an explanation: she actually believes that she's bigger than you and no numbers or comparing in the mirror will convince her because what she will actually see is that she's somehow bigger than you. So you telling her to lose weight when she's looking for reassurance would be devastating.\n\nOne more question: why do you think her behaviour is about you and putting you down?", "Only reason I ask is that people with body dysmorphia have no clear view of their body. \n\nTo be clear, it\u2019s still terrible and insensitive. At best, she\u2019s fatphobic, which is unacceptable. At worst, she suffers from dysmorphia AND is fatphobic. \n\nObviously, NTA. It\u2019s just baffling that she could be this dense, insensitive and attention seeking. Praying it\u2019s dysmorphia, otherwise she\u2019s just an awful person.", "But you said that you didn\u2019t mean your comment. I don\u2019t think the answer to this is to trigger her insecurity that could led her to an ED.\n\nI think it is a sensitive topic, while she may have an ED she may not, and like you said maybe she said those comments to get validation, you know her I don\u2019t. I just thought that maybe she wasn\u2019t even thinking to insulting you, but if you have talked to her about that and she keeps pushing this maybe who knows", "Because she knows I am in a worse off position than her. I said \u201cyou do know I\u2019m heavier than you right?\u201d And she says \u201cyeah\u2026\u201d \n\nIf you publicly say \u201chaving this quality makes me bad.\u201d It sends the message that anyone who shares that quality is bad too, whether she means it or not.", "Body dysmorphia or not, she knows that there is a 60 lb difference when we step on the scale. Numbers do not lie.", "Utter nonsense, she's fishing for compliments, the fact that she's immediately stopped when she didn't get the praise she was seeking makes that clear.\n\nShe may well be seeking the compliments due to insecurity rather than vanity but it's irrelevant.\n\nFair play to OP they tried asking nicely but their \"friend\" made it clear that the compliments were more important to her than their feelings. \n\nOP is definitely NTA", "I didn\u2019t mean it but I\u2019m not very sorry for saying it.

She was convinced she was obese\u2026obsessively. She was not. Objectively, medically, visibly, numerically. It was very weird. She ended up having to see a therapist. I\u2019d never known this was a condition. \n\nI\u2019m not arguing that you\u2019re anything, but NTA btw.", "The you are NTA if she keeps saying those comments even after you talked with her \nBut if you don\u2019t feel comfortable with this friendship you should maybe keep your distance", "Thanks. Im glad that she saw a therapist instead of making everyone else around her miserable", "Me too, it was rough on everyone. Though in your case, this could just be an attention seeker. You know her, so if your gut says it\u2019s BS, it likely is. Sorry for semi-hijacking with the question. Maybe back away from her as much as possible.", "No worries! There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to know more information.", "NTA", "NTA smart move", "NTA. I don't use this phrase very often, but she really asked for it.", "I know someone like this and it is exhausting and annoying. If she sees you eating your lunch (sandwich, salad, whatever...) she will ALWAYS say 'oh look at you just stuffing your face, I wish I could do that'.\n\nIt means that people just don't want to be around her any longer, well I certainly don't", "NTA and don\u2019t let her bring you down. Some people see their body through different lenses than other bodies. She might truly think you look better than her. Or she might try to bring you down to feel better. What I ended up doing with one friend that did this for years was to agree. If she said she was huge and gross, I agreed. And after a while, she started responding by \u201cbut it is not so bad\u201d. And little later, she stopped making those remarks in front of me. I guess and AH move on my side, but the result trumped my guilty feelings", "NTA.  I can't be doing with people like this.  She made a complaint that she has made many times.  You offered her a solution.", "Do you know what body dysmorphia is and are positive she doesn't have it.", "I was on the fence, but YTA for this comment.", "If she had an ED instead of fishing for compliments, she would engage in diet and exercising. And she wouldn't  constantly seek attention to her weight, nor she would have a picatcu face when op talked to her. Also notice that op never claimed the friend had a weight problem, she just told her that since she is ripetively complaining, why doesn't she actually do something about it. I also thought of an ED, but I think in this specific case it is attention seeking. And whatever her insecurities are, she doesn't get to act out on other people's experiences.", "You don't have to alienate from the whole group because of her. And you shouldn't feel you have to walk on eggshells around her. NTA"]}
