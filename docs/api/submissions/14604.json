They are being irresponsible especially if they leave him home alone", "NTA\n\nThat child, especially if he has a disability and is non-verbal, is in danger of being seriously hurt if he gets out alone. Even if he isn't, four is too young to be on his own outside alone. I would call CPS. His parents need to be taking steps like putting alarms on all the doors. They could also securely fence a portion of their yard with locks on any gates so that he could go outside, if he likes to play outside. Of course, they would still need to watch him, but it would make it harder for him to wander off.", "Going with NTA.  They have already had a scare that involved the police and a search.  Document the approximate dates of each event as best you can before you call them.

In that time we\u2019ve seen their son (around 4 years old) wandering around our property on his own several times. \n\nSome examples are he appeared on our doorstep at 10:30pm one night and when we took him back to his house, his parents thought he was upstairs asleep. They themselves were at a different neighbours house having some drinks. \n\nAnother time we saw him wandering around on our security cameras pulling fruit off some trees we have. Another time we saw his parent on our security cameras walking round the back of our house Iooking for something. (We assume his child) \n\nAnother time the police were called and we were involved in a missing child search because the son had disappeared. Luckily it was short and he was found close by. \n\nI\u2019m not 100% but I think the child might be non verbal. I\u2019m basing this on the fact that he has never spoken to me when I\u2019ve found him somewhere but he might just be shy and didn\u2019t want to speak because he thought he might be in trouble. \n\nAlthough we don\u2019t live in a dangerous area, there are mental health and social assistance facilities in the area that lead to some strange people in the area. I\u2019m personally not bothered as an adult but an unattended child is a different matter. The road we live on is very busy and there have been 2 serious accidents directly outside my house in the last 3 years. \n\nWe sent a text to the family last time we saw their son on his own and explained that we do not feel safe with him on our property as there are lots of tools/ renovation materials etc around and that when we see him we feel a responsibility to make sure he gets home safely which isn\u2019t a responsibility we want. We both wfh and have had to leave meetings to return him back to his house before. We also suggested some ways to baby proof their sliding door as they mentioned that he sometimes slips out that way. They didn\u2019t respond. \n\nNow the weather is getting warmer, we\u2019ve had some damage to our garden. Rocks that form a border to a flower bed have been rolled down the hill towards our house and it\u2019s pretty clear it was a child playing as we found some marbles. \n\nNow the damage pisses me off, I won\u2019t lie, but I really don\u2019t want to start up with this again. We have a cat who we don\u2019t want freaked out as he\u2019s very territorial and bad with children. The rocks were also rolled at propane tanks that we use for our bbq and outdoor fire.  Right now, it\u2019s not serious damage so it doesn\u2019t really matter. But it does represent a dangerous situation for everyone involved. \n\nWIBTA if I reported the situation to CPS?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If he is nonverbal it sounds like he shouldn't be left alone in the house, but they're definitely doing that. Next time you see him, call CPS immediately to report an unattended child. He needs better care than hus parents are providing", "NTA. It seems like (from your post) that you would have plenty of evidence to provide to a social worker who would have the child\u2019s best interest in mind. You\u2019ve done right by suggesting things to the parents and not just yelling at them or belittling them. Their lack of action in the matter can wind up with their child being hurt. If their child does get hurt, you may end up feeling guilty for not having reported it, and that\u2019s an unfair guilt that can be avoided by calling CPS. You\u2019d be doing that child a favor. Good luck OP! I hope this works out for both you and this poor kiddo.", "Seems like these parents are either clueless or need some help. So if you approach the issue with being of service to the child I think you\u2019re fine. Damage to your yard seems like the least of the problem here. You may want to involve the police though & check on your homeowners insurance. \n\nYWNBTA", "YWNTA, calling CPS about any concern is never the wrong thing to do. CPS will investigate, judge if the concern is warranted and will respond accordingly. Sometimes its about building a picture to understand that a child is in danger and every report helps. \n\nThis situation certainly needs investigating into why it is happening repeatedly. I would also think that getting the police involved if another large search party is ever formed. This should not be happening on a frequent basis and sounds like the tell-tell signs of neglect.", "Call CPS this is the right thing to do. You are being proactive and protective. You\u2019re not doing g it to be a jerk. Legitimate reason to call. If the child dies and you didn\u2019t call before you will feel guilty.", "NTA The issues you discuss are serious and the family clearly needs support.", "NTA This child is clearly neglected. CPS needs to get involved for the sake of the child. Call them before real tragedy strikes.", "Yeah I agree. It\u2019s really not about the garden, it\u2019s annoying but whatever. Plants grow back. The rocks are heavy and in a steep hill. If he slipped one could really hurt him. Hell it would hurt me if I slipped while moving them. The propane tanks are a real concern for the safety of my household if they were damaged.", "I\u2019ve decided to make a report. Thanks to everyone for your perspectives. It\u2019s really helped me make a decision I don\u2019t take lightly.", "I\u2019m concerned about the danger the damage represents, not the damage itself. The reason I\u2019ve not called at this point is that the family seem like nice people and come from a more rural area. It seems like they might have benefitted from a block mom type community in the past and may be expecting the same of neighbours here. When we made it clear we weren\u2019t ok with that, we didn\u2019t have any more issues so we thought they had shifted their expectations. Now the weather is warmer and he\u2019s been back, we\u2019re not so sure.", "They are quince bushes so large enough to be called trees but have low enough branches for fruit that he could easily reach.", "I think the point is it took damage to your property before you thought of that. Not a child at your door at 10:30pm when the parents were drinking elsewhere. That should have been what prompted a call to CPS.", "This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve considered calling CPS.  They moved from a more rural area where it\u2019s very common to leave doors unlocked and have block moms. After we sent them the text saying we didn\u2019t want that responsibility, we didn\u2019t see any issues for months so we thought they had made some changes. Now the weather is warmer, we\u2019ve had an indicator that he is wandering around again.", "Doesn't matter. The call should have been made when the child wandered off in the middle of the night. YWNBTA to call now. Better late than never, I suppose. But it feels icky that it took damage to your property for you to care that much."]}
