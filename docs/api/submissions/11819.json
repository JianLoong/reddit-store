{"id": 11819, "submission_id": "11m7p86", "title": "AITA for not paying my half sister\u2019s mom after she broke a car rental agreement?", "selftext": "Back in November, my half sister (19f) graduated from her Air Force basic training. Because of my schedule, I took a flight to the city and back. Round trip cost me around $550. My half sister\u2019s mom, Janet(40f) rented a van for her and the other 4 people who attended the graduation to drive there and back. This trip was 48hrs total. While we were there, we would all pile into the van and go to whatever activities we had planned for the day. \n\nAbout a week after getting back, Janet puts all of us (excluding half sister) into a group chat and tells us that the rental company is fining her another $500 for a cleaning fee. Once they were back, she had picked up my half sister\u2019s dog and brought it home, so there was dog hair in the van. She claims that since we had all used the van, we should all pay a portion of the fine. I called the rental company and they explained that this fee was because there was dog hair in the car, and the agreement that she signed states that there are no pets allowed in the vehicle, and that if the contract is broken in any way, the fine is $500. \n\nAfter this call, I messaged back telling Janet that I will not be paying anything, because I paid for myself to fly instead of ride in the van, and I didn\u2019t break the contract. She lashed back saying that \u201cYou have a job to pay for these things\u201d \u201cIf I added up the cost of you riding in the van with us, it would be much more\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t live with my parents or have a husband to help with bills\u201d \u201c[half sister] made a courageous decision to join the military, and since this is her dog you should be willing to pitch in\u201d\n\nThe people who rode in the van for the trip there and back all paid what she asked. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\nIf it helps, I can add screenshots of the group chat and our PMs. And if there\u2019s any interest in more detail, I\u2019d be happy to elaborate.\n\nEdit: Told my dad about this issue. Later on, he told me that after hearing the situation, he sent her a check for $200 because it was close to Christmas and he has a very generous nature.", "created_utc": 1678308518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11m7p86/aita_for_not_paying_my_half_sisters_mom_after_she/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have no responsibility for the rental. She rented it and she broke the contract. This is really a ridiculous demand.", "No, definitely NTA. She isn\u2019t asking for people to pitch in for gas or anything\u2026 she is asking for you to pay for her breaking the lease agreement. That isn\u2019t your responsibility. It\u2019s fully hers. She should have thought about that before she broke the lease agreement.", "Hahahaha, no, NTA. She is really reaching for any and every darn thing she can think of to have someone else foot this bill, isn't she? You're good...", "NTA. She could have cleaned the vehicle herself and they'd have been none the wiser. Additionally it was actually her that incurred the fine.

She is solely responsible for the consequences.\n\nI can't think of a single reason why you would be owe her anything. The van was rented principally so they could drive there and not pay air tickets.\n\nShe would be a bit greedy if she wanted to charge you 1/6 of the rental fee for the actual days you were in the van while you were attending the ceremonies with the rest of the people. I have calculated that as there seems to be 5 people who traveled in the van plus you. That would be a nominal amount but it would fairly compensate for your limited use.", "NTA\nJust leave the chat and if necessary block her number.", "NTA. \n\nNone of you are responsible for the bill. She knew when she signed the contract that she would be charged.", "NTA - I mean you absolutely shouldn't it's a problem of her own making. She broke the rules she should pay.", "NTA\n\nThe extra fee is all based on things that she did after you had already gone home.  Not to mention, she rented the car, so she knew (or should've known) that no dogs were allowed... this is on her.\n\nAll the stuff about your half sister's courageous decision to join the military has absolutely nothing to do with this situation so she can keep all that BS to herself.", "NTA. Don\u2019t feel bad for someone else mistakes", "NTA, Janet is the candid one.\n\nyour dad is a chump though, there were 5 people who took the road trip in the van, and he paid her almost half of her penalty that belongs to Janet alone.", "NTA\n\nShe broke the rental agreement after you all left, and she expects you all to help absorb the added cost of *her* actions? She can pay for her own screw-up.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely the mother\u2019s fault for having a dog in the car and voiding the terms of the contract. Very generous of your dad to send her money, but not necessary.", "NTA she rented the van, she signed the contract, and she chose to violate it.", "NTA.  She\u2019s responsible", "NTA. She\u2019s the one who broke the contract. She\u2019s the one who can pay it.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t bring the dog - she did.

She CHOSE to break the agreement.", "NTA. Your half sister\u2019s mom screwed up and wants to spread the pain around. Don\u2019t give in.", "NTA\n\n She chose to break the rental agreement and transport the dog.  If she had fully cleaned the van, she would not have been assessed the fee.", "NTA The agreement with the rental car company is \"No Pets\". You didn't break the agreement Janet did. Let Janet pay the $500. She has some nerve trying to arm twist you into paying for something that was HER fault.", "NTA. Even if you had been in the van for the trip, her later on taking the dog in the van and not spending the time to vacuum it out is all on her.

It would have been the polite thing to do when we were down there. \n\nWe didn\u2019t travel more than 20 miles total in the days while we were there, because we had a very limited area where my half sister was allowed to go.
