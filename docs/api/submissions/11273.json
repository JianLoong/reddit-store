I met David during my sophomore year of college through some mutual friends. We weren\u2019t close initially, but sometime during our junior year we really hit it off because we were pursuing the same degree and had similar aspirations. \n\nWhen I first started law school, I nearly died when my appendix burst. No one I knew at the time knew how to get a hold of my family, and my emergency contact was unreachable. David stayed at the hospital until I was released, and cooked and cleaned for me everyday until I was better. It\u2019s the single nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.   \n\nWe now work for the same law firm. A few weeks ago David met with another lawyer (Paul) from a firm who was looking to refer a client to us. Paul stopped by the office to meet with David and struck up a conversation with me when he recognized me in the office. Before David met with Paul, I told him I knew Paul because we had gone to private school together as kids and our well-off families had brushed shoulders all my life. This was not the full story. \n\nDuring the meeting, Paul talked with David about our shared history. David was blindsided and didn\u2019t like being chatted up by a lawyer from another firm about how he couldn\u2019t believe David managed to get \u201csomeone like me\u201d to work for him. \n\nAfter, I told David the full story. I come from an incredibly rich family. I\u2019m talking summer in the Hamptons, take the private jet abroad on the weekend kind of rich. I told him how my family had really strict expectations of what they wanted from me, and when I graduated high school I decided to cut ties and move across the country. They cut me off financially, I had no car, no credit cards, etc.  \n\nOn a personal level, David doesn\u2019t understand why I kept something like this from him in the first place. He's embarrassed he ever confided in me about issues over money over the years when at any moment in time I could have picked up the phone and my family would have paid my way. He feels like I let him believe I had a background very similar to his, when the reality is our early lives were as different as night and day. I have definitely made an effort to downplay any suggestion that I grew up with any sort of wealth. \n\nOn a professional level, David feels like I put him in an awkward situation. He was really put off by the conversation Paul had with him and felt like it was avoidable if I\u2019d told the truth sooner. Some of what they talked about made him feel like there may be a conflict of interest he should have been aware of. \n\nThis is where I might be the asshole. I apologized for how he found out, but I am not sorry for not having told him about my family/past sooner. I haven\u2019t told a single person about my family/background since I cut ties and moved across the country. I don\u2019t feel like I owe anyone my past, and I was clear that had Paul not walked into the office that day, I never would have told David anything at all.", "created_utc": 1677731948, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ft3sd/aita_for_lying_to_a_close_friendcolleague_about/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are free to be selective in who you share your past with, but he is also totally fair to feel a certain way about it.", "I think it\u2019s understandable if he feels like \u201cI thought we were close enough that you would have told me something like that, and I feel like a jerk learning it from some schmuck in our office.\u201d  I also think it\u2019s understandable that after you and your family apparently cut ties, that you didn\u2019t want to talk about them (or about the private jet that would have made people make assumptions about you).\n\nI don\u2019t think there is an asshole here, it\u2019s just an awkward situation.  Maybe you can talk later and tell him you understand his feelings and you hope that he can understand yours?  NAH", "So, David is upset because he acknowledges that he *absolutely* would have treated you differently if he'd known about your family's money? \n\nNTA.\n\nThe very fact that he recognizes that he would have treated you differently should make it perfectly clear to him why you declined to share that information. It's a shame that he doesn't realize that It says something good about your character that you didn't *want* to be treated like the rich kid.\n\nHopefully, it is just the shock of it all and he'll snap out of it soon.\n\nBecause if I suddenly found out that one of my friends had a family history such as yours, I would feel shocked and saddened... Not because I would have treated them differently or because I felt like I was entitled to know that information, but because something terrible must have happened to you to cause you to cut ties with them so dramatically after high school. Furthermore, the fact that they reacted to that by financially cutting you off--when clearly they have enough money that that wasn't necessary--means that there is some serious toxicity in them. \n\nI would be filled with regret that you had never felt safe enough with me to share such a profoundly impactful chapter of your life... I would be questioning myself, and wondering if there was anything I could have done to be a better friend to you.", "NTA no one is entitled to your past experiences or traumas or upbringing", "NAH. I would be hurt if someone I was friends with for years basically lied by omission about most of their life. It is not about the substance of the lie but knowing they could just casually be untruthful to me for so long. \n\nI understand why you did it, but looking at it from his perspective, you can see why he is hurt.", "Info: why did you lie to your friend about your upbringing? You elaborated profusely on that piece, but never answered it", "I mean I can understand how he can feel hurt by being lied to by omission.  As a lawyer I don\u2019t see how it could be a conflict of interest, that\u2019s a stretch - unless your parents own corporations and you guys are suing corporations or something.  You don\u2019t currently have access to those family funds so I\u2019m not sure why you would disclose it so NTA", "YTA. Generally I'd agree with you, but it sounds like you consider David a friend and you've known each other for years. You've intentionally led him to believe something that wasn't true, which is an AH to do to a friend. Especially one that's really been there for you.\n\nWhy would you do that? What did you gain? Do you not trust David?", "NTA. He\u2019s feeling embarrassed. But as someone who has also cut ties with family, that\u2019s not something I discuss with people. Like\u2026it\u2019s just not something I really talk about. They\u2019re not in my life. I don\u2019t discuss other strangers with coworkers/friends either.", "Nta. This was obviously painful for you to walk away from family who would cut you off for being yourself. People make big assumptions about wealth and that it solves everything. You weren\u2019t wealthy and were struggling to find your own identity not defined by your family\u2019s money when you met him. The past is the past. It doesn\u2019t define you. If he\u2019s upset about not being told, I\u2019d ask him to tell you more why that is. Does he feel lied to, like you don\u2019t trust him, or is does he think of you differently because of your family/wealthy upbringing? If it\u2019s the last one, that says more about him than you and would kind of prove valid a big reason why you were reluctant to share. Have you told him how much him caring for you that time means to you to this day? Your own family disowned you because you wanted to work (gasp!) and earn and create a life for yourself you could be proud of- and you are doing that. If you value the friendship, have an honest conversation about it all. I would apologize sincerely about hiding your history and hurting him, and explain you felt ashamed and afraid of being rejected and judged (which is a trauma history you legit have) and then having no one, which I\u2019m guessing is actually the truth.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Obviously there is the issue of deception, perceived or otherwise, but perhaps more important is the fact that they will realize that they were never truly as close to the person as they thought, because they never knew as much about them as they believed. \n\nI think that may be a big part of Dave\u2019s problem. He thought the two of them were much closer than they were. He thought he knew her, when, in fact, there was a huge chunk of her life he actually knew nothing about.  It gives the appearance that she doesn\u2019t trust him enough or feel close enough to him to open up and reveal even basic details of her past. Something I\u2019ll bet he did with her. A mere acquaintance probably wouldn\u2019t care, but someone who thought he was a close, trusted friend definitely would.", "I wish I had a good reason, but the truth is its just something I defaulted into doing after I moved. When I enrolled in college I had to get multiple jobs to afford classes and a crappy dorm where I lived with three other girls. Nome of them were well off, and they just... kind of assumed I wasn't either. I never corrected them, I just let it ride, and have been letting it ride ever since.\n\nI've definitely told white lies over the years to keep up the facade. An example is we once talked about everyone's first car. I told them my first car was the little beater I drove in college. In reality, my first car was a brand new Lexus I got for my sixteenth birthday.\n\nI wish I could say I strategically kept this from people to keep anyone from taking advantage of me or judging me. But it really just sort of happened, and at some point I decided I didn't want anyone to know about my family. I'd rather maintain a false or fake past than have to talk about what my life was actually like.", "Your last sentence..why?", "i see this duplicity as a character flaw.\n\ni also grew up going to the hamptons. didn't have a private jet but i had friends who did. my ex gf would always complain loudly to others about having no money when we were in college meanwhile her mom was dating a billionaire and her dad was building a second house in mustique. i understand why he feels blindsided, someone who is comfortable lying like this is fake and untrustworthy."]}
