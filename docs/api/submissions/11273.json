I met David during my sophomore year of college through some mutual friends. We weren\u2019t close initially, but sometime during our junior year we really hit it off because we were pursuing the same degree and had similar aspirations. \n\nWhen I first started law school, I nearly died when my appendix burst. No one I knew at the time knew how to get a hold of my family, and my emergency contact was unreachable. David stayed at the hospital until I was released, and cooked and cleaned for me everyday until I was better. It\u2019s the single nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.   \n\nWe now work for the same law firm. A few weeks ago David met with another lawyer (Paul) from a firm who was looking to refer a client to us. Paul stopped by the office to meet with David and struck up a conversation with me when he recognized me in the office. Before David met with Paul, I told him I knew Paul because we had gone to private school together as kids and our well-off families had brushed shoulders all my life. This was not the full story. \n\nDuring the meeting, Paul talked with David about our shared history. David was blindsided and didn\u2019t like being chatted up by a lawyer from another firm about how he couldn\u2019t believe David managed to get \u201csomeone like me\u201d to work for him. \n\nAfter, I told David the full story. I come from an incredibly rich family. I\u2019m talking summer in the Hamptons, take the private jet abroad on the weekend kind of rich. I told him how my family had really strict expectations of what they wanted from me, and when I graduated high school I decided to cut ties and move across the country. They cut me off financially, I had no car, no credit cards, etc.  \n\nOn a personal level, David doesn\u2019t understand why I kept something like this from him in the first place. He's embarrassed he ever confided in me about issues over money over the years when at any moment in time I could have picked up the phone and my family would have paid my way. He feels like I let him believe I had a background very similar to his, when the reality is our early lives were as different as night and day. I have definitely made an effort to downplay any suggestion that I grew up with any sort of wealth. \n\nOn a professional level, David feels like I put him in an awkward situation. He was really put off by the conversation Paul had with him and felt like it was avoidable if I\u2019d told the truth sooner. Some of what they talked about made him feel like there may be a conflict of interest he should have been aware of. \n\nThis is where I might be the asshole. I apologized for how he found out, but I am not sorry for not having told him about my family/past sooner. I haven\u2019t told a single person about my family/background since I cut ties and moved across the country. I don\u2019t feel like I owe anyone my past, and I was clear that had Paul not walked into the office that day, I never would have told David anything at all.", "created_utc": 1677731948, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ft3sd/aita_for_lying_to_a_close_friendcolleague_about/", "score": 190, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's a shame that he doesn't realize that It says something good about your character that you didn't *want* to be treated like the rich kid.\n\nHopefully, it is just the shock of it all and he'll snap out of it soon.\n\nBecause if I suddenly found out that one of my friends had a family history such as yours, I would feel shocked and saddened... Not because I would have treated them differently or because I felt like I was entitled to know that information, but because something terrible must have happened to you to cause you to cut ties with them so dramatically after high school. Furthermore, the fact that they reacted to that by financially cutting you off--when clearly they have enough money that that wasn't necessary--means that there is some serious toxicity in them. \n\nI would be filled with regret that you had never felt safe enough with me to share such a profoundly impactful chapter of your life...

Generally I'd agree with you, but it sounds like you consider David a friend and you've known each other for years. You've intentionally led him to believe something that wasn't true, which is an AH to do to a friend. Especially one that's really been there for you.\n\nWhy would you do that? What did you gain? Do you not trust David?", "NTA. He\u2019s feeling embarrassed. But as someone who has also cut ties with family, that\u2019s not something I discuss with people. Like\u2026it\u2019s just not something I really talk about. They\u2019re not in my life. I don\u2019t discuss other strangers with coworkers/friends either.", "Nta. This was obviously painful for you to walk away from family who would cut you off for being yourself. People make big assumptions about wealth and that it solves everything. You weren\u2019t wealthy and were struggling to find your own identity not defined by your family\u2019s money when you met him. The past is the past. It doesn\u2019t define you. If he\u2019s upset about not being told, I\u2019d ask him to tell you more why that is. Does he feel lied to, like you don\u2019t trust him, or is does he think of you differently because of your family/wealthy upbringing? If it\u2019s the last one, that says more about him than you and would kind of prove valid a big reason why you were reluctant to share. Have you told him how much him caring for you that time means to you to this day? Your own family disowned you because you wanted to work (gasp!) and earn and create a life for yourself you could be proud of- and you are doing that. If you value the friendship, have an honest conversation about it all. I would apologize sincerely about hiding your history and hurting him, and explain you felt ashamed and afraid of being rejected and judged (which is a trauma history you legit have) and then having no one, which I\u2019m guessing is actually the truth.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He thought the two of them were much closer than they were. He thought he knew her, when, in fact, there was a huge chunk of her life he actually knew nothing about.  It gives the appearance that she doesn\u2019t trust him enough or feel close enough to him to open up and reveal even basic details of her past. Something I\u2019ll bet he did with her.

So yes, something materially changed.\n\nAt least for me, I assume my friends are honest with me, because I value that. I, in turn, am honest with them. If I found out someone had lied to me for a decade, it'd change how I saw them.\n\nI'd also have to wonder: why lie? This is something that does seem small, so why continue to deceive people you care about? OP couldn't answer that in her response either.\n\nAnd yeah, it often is that simple.

Although I do think your friend is coming from a place of privilege that he doesn't realise he has. People think it just means money. They don't realise that the fact that they can ring their family for support - not just financial but emotional as well - that doesn't mean everyone can. Nobody at 18 chooses to leave their family on a whim. Yes not understanding that you don't have that and he's not entitled to knowing your trauma. And really, at the point that the money mattered - post-18 - you didn't have it. So you weren't playing at being broke, you were broke. The fact that child you had a private jet doesn't change the fact that adult you had to work multiple jobs to get by. Therefore that was an experience you share - that part wasn't a lie.", "NTA", "NTA. That\u2019s really not his biz.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nIf this is real, it's weird. Ppl w serious money rarely let ppl know IME. That's pretty normal.", ">\"All this time, I could have been using you for money!\"\n\nI think you've misread part of her post, assuming you got that from the below\n\n> He's embarrassed he ever confided in me about issues over money over the years when at any moment in time I could have picked up the phone and my family would have paid my way", "Come on, the implication is clear. \"I confided in you about money problems, and I'm mad that you could have instantly solved your own money problems for yourself all along! I definitely don't mean I'm mad you didn't offer to use the money from parents who cut you off to help me\" said no one ever. He 100% means she should have given him money all those times he was struggling.", "I think it could more easily be explaned by, \"we've been best friends for years, I thought I knew everything, but now this major development is making me question every interaction we've ever had\". He could go some way to understanding where OP is coming from, sure, but I don't think that is such an unusual response to this blindside.", "Prescription for you: Common People by Pulp. \n\nYou don't have to be personally after someone's family wealth to notice the difference it makes to your experience of financial difficulty to have a potential solution be one phone call away. Even if it's something you'd only resort to in an emergency, that's different to have no one to call with the means to help. \n\nNot that I fault OP for intentionally avoiding people finding out about how they grew up, especially given they're estranged from their family.", "Unusual, no, but just because way too many people feel that close friendship means having no secrets doesn't make it factually true. When you find out your friend's past includes beong cut off by your parents for wanting to pursue your own dreams, a true friend's reaction would be compassion, not, \"What about ME?!\" Even if discovering something your friend suffered changes how you see them, making the discovery all about you, creating an obligation to you, making your lack of full knowledge more important than their pain, is just plain wrong.", "They cut her off and took away her things based solely on her moving away - it doesn't sound like they would exactly be willing to solve her financial problems if she called.  They don't specify in Common People but I'm assuming that the antagonist of that song is just choosing to live like common people, she could go back to her family easily at any time.  OP doesn't have that choice.", "It's not about ME, it's about US i.e. the relationship. I think you're severely underestimating how jarring it is to learn you have been operating under false impression of someone so close for years. Even if the info actually doesn't matter, the revelation certainly can still sting.", "How is OP's relationship with her family relevant to David's impression of her? She's still the same person he's known for years. The revelation wasn't about some horrible crime she committed but about other people connected to her."]}
