Raf and I are paying for our wedding ourselves. That was always something we planned on doing and we have saved for a number of years to afford a nice wedding. Ever since my dad died when I was 6 I knew in the future if I got married, his dad, my granddad, would be walking me down the aisle and dancing with me in dad's place. Honestly I think even if dad was alive I'd have both of them because granddad and I always had a special relationship. When I played weddings as a kid I used to have both of them \"walk me down the aisle\" lol.\n\nI was upfront about asking granddad to my mom and stepdad. They didn't take the news great. My stepdad wanted to be the one who performed as father of the bride and he told me as much. He didn't like that I was giving him and my mom focus as a couple but not him as my dad, and he said this because I arranged for a special dance for the two of them as well as a special toast to the two of them during the wedding. He said after being in my life since I was 7 (when I met him) and being my stepdad since I was 9 (when he and mom got married officially) he feels he is more deserving of the role. I told him I understood he was upset but I had made my decision. He said it was childish to keep to a decision I made as a baby and never open myself up to alternatives.\n\nWhen I didn't give in they got a little huffy and I decided to leave to give them some space. Then my stepdad came to me and said I should let him pay for the wedding. This came out of nowhere honestly but I knew instantly what he was trying to do. I knew that if I took his money, I wouldn't be able to say no to him, it would be entitled as hell to let him pay but not give him the role he wants and the jobs he wants to do. It also wouldn't have felt right to me anyway because I never went to him for anything. So it would have felt like I was taking advantage and he's never going to be my dad, he can't buy that from me, so I stuck to my convictions and I said thanks for offering but we're good, we have the money. \n\nHe went on a long rant about how traditionally, the father of the bride always pays for the wedding and how tradition is important and he said it was bad luck to pay for your own wedding. I told him we were a more modern couple and had chosen to pay for our own wedding with no financial contributions from anyone. He was angry and he left.\n\nEver since he and my mom have said I disrespected him immensely by denying him the right to pay. Mom brought up how he comes from a very traditional and conservative family and that it is shameful for him not to be paying for everything. She told me he had been looking forward to paying for my special day and I threw his more than generous offer in his face. My stepdad told me I had ruined the whole wedding for him now.\n\nAlso I don't want both granddad and stepdad to do the walk/dance.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696927912, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174gdsy/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_stepdad_pay_for_my/", "score": 1610, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your decision to pay for your own wedding aligns with your values as a modern couple.\n\nOn the other hand, your stepdad has been a part of your life for a long time and feels hurt that he won't have a significant role in the wedding. His desire to contribute financially and play a traditional role in the wedding is rooted in his own values and background.\n\nIt's a communication issue and a clash of expectations and traditions. While it's important to respect your stepdad's feelings, ultimately, it's your wedding, and you should make decisions that feel right to you. It might be helpful to have an open and empathetic conversation with your stepdad to try and find a compromise or a way to involve him in a meaningful way that respects your relationship with him.\n\nEdit to add: at the end of the day you need to do what makes you feel happy! As a bride who literally got married 3 days ago I know how stressful this whole situation can be and had a lot of similar circumstances. \nI told a lot of people \u2026 and offended a lot of people with \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding.. not yours\u201d", "Not his wedding blah blah blah NTA ect \nBut.\n\n\nCan\u2019t help but feel sorry for step dad.

Is that something you really want to do?\"\n\nIf he is a traditional guy, as your mom suggests, than he very well may have said he would like to pay even though he does not get decisions. Also, just because you thought the idea of him paying came out of nowhere does not mean it did.

He even told granddad in front of me to \"step aside\" so he could be there.", "How the fuck are you going to tell a complete stranger they\u2019re wrong about what happened in their own life? The absolute brass bollocks of it. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if he helped pay the bills when she was a kid. That was a choice he made as an adult, which OP had no control over as a child. She now has control over it and is refusing his money because mutual trust, respect and affection cannot be bought.\n\nOP owes her stepdad absolutely *nothing*. \n\nAnd this has fuck all to do with gender. There are thousands of mothers out there thinking they can buy control over their children\u2019s weddings and that is just as fucked up as OP\u2019s stepdad thinking he can buy a controlling share of OP\u2019s wedding plans. Get tae fuck.", "Quit projecting your personal issues on OP.", "For sure. As a 7 year old she should have just gotten a job in the coal mines!", "You keep saying let, then dismiss anyone who says she had no choice by saying no one has a choice. Which is it? Does he get a parade for wanting to sleep with her mom, or did op go to a shop and choose him as a step dad at build a man worshop", "Won't acknowledge it?? Did you read the post?\n\nOP was giving her step-dad & mom a special toast & a dance. As a couple. Why is he entitled to more than her mother? \n\nWalking her down the aisle is not the only way to honor & show appreciation for someone. Not bending to his demands does not make her a user.\n\nA good parent would respect her wishes. A decent parent wouldn't consider the most important day of their step child's life ruined bc someone else is walking her down the aisle.", "So you are equating stealing with being a kid?\n\nNo kid chooses to be born. Parents aren't some fuvking God's for raising the Kids they decided to have.\n\nKids don't owe their parents anything", "It is a weird situation, and your memories are not the most reliable in any case. And even if you remember everything correctly  there might be more to the story because you have no idea what all was said and done when you weren\u2019t in the room but regardless you are entitled to your feelings and it is your wedding but I do recommend having an open and frank conversation with your parents, granddad about your childhood instead of just saying \u201cI don\u2019t feel you\u2019re my dad and it\u2019s my wedding\u201d", "I will also point out I have not and will nit defend your step dad, I just don\u2019t want you to look at this thread and feel your step dad is a monster", "I have repeatedly said OP can do whatever she wants, as kids we make assumptions that are later revealed to be completely false. Obviously every kid hates their step dad at first and that hurt can mean a lot of things, also she kinda \u201cowes\u201d her step-dad something he did raise her. He paid for her, took her to school etc. I agree it\u2019s a weird  situation, and as I said earlier the only real solution is to not date single moms", "I have no such issues, but the claim that step-dad comes in and says nope this is my kid now is super sus. Most step dads don\u2019t give a f, such pressure usually comes from the mom. Maybe the step-dad is made \u201cthe bad guy\u201d but imo what happened was it was the mom that didn\u2019t want the kid to meet grand-dad instead of step-dad.", "Did you go to a shop and choose your parents?", "I equate giving and taking to parent and child relationship.  It weird how you position it as stealing... do you steal from your parents? \n\n\n>Kids don't owe their parents anything\n\nYes, those who take take take and don't acknowledge it are users.  That's literally definition of the word user.", "He became a monster when he prevented her from talking to and seeing the very person who loved and cared for her longer than he ever had. \n\nBased on your comments, you probably never had someone important and precious to you ripped away due to the jealousy and malicious actions of someone else due to their fragile ego. That can have a major impact on a child's life and cause major resentment in the future. However, no one ever thinks about what's best for the child, only themselves.\n\nIf the stepfather were to join in on different activities with her grandfather and showed him the respect he deserved for being there when her father passed, then maybe he wouldn't be a self-absorbed narcissistic monster, and he might have earned a special place in OPs heart and life.", "In the grand scheme of it, he did a nice thing but he is now looking at it to say that now she will view him as a replacement dad, lol, which is telling he was selfish. He could of done those things because he just wanted to and to make sure she grows up happy. But now it feels like he is entitled to the whole dad shtik. \n\nOpie has one Dad and he is not him and though he must have been a lovely man who loved her mother, she saw her grandfather as a father figure instead, which is entirely her decision. \n\nAt the end of the day, it is Opie's wedding and if it wasn't for her dad being taken away. Dear old step-dad would not be in the picture.\n\nOpie is literally honoring him by giving a toast and giving him a special dance for him and her mum. Not many \"users\" would do that much. \n\nAnd my friend, you don't force a child or in this case a fully grown woman to do something they clearly clearly clearly don't want to do. Maybe there is more context to their relationship, other than him gatekeeping her grandparents from her for 3 years but unless Opie gives an update, we will never know.", "If you choose to do something for someone without being asked, you cannot expect them to be grateful, thankful or repay you\n\nYou took the choice to do it upon yourself and that comes with the risk", "No, and i also didnt \"let\" my parents do all that. Wasn't my choice.", "I used your metaphor and asked if you were equating  Kids with stealing and then you ask me if I'm doing that? Wtf \n\nKids don't take take take. They are owed that."]}
