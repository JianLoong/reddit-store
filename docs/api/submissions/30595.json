We\u2019ll call him Joe. Our families were very close, so we essentially grew up together. He and my sister (30F) were closer in age, so they were much closer as kids than he and I were, and they ended up dating in high school. I wasn\u2019t really privy to much of their romance, because my sister and I hardly spoke to each other except when we were arguing, but I do know they had a pretty nasty break up and weren\u2019t friends anymore after the fact. \n\nMy sister, Jen, and I aren\u2019t close. We had a lot of problems growing up that I don\u2019t really need to get into here because I don\u2019t want to skew anyone\u2019s opinion about THIS situation. I only know our problems from my side, so of course they\u2019re gonna be bias. But, long story short, we don\u2019t get along. We\u2019re civil at family gatherings, and it\u2019s not like we can\u2019t be in the same room without fighting, we just choose not to spend extended amounts of time with each other or hang out alone. So, I don\u2019t know really anything about her or her life, and it\u2019s been that way pretty much since we both left home. \n\nAfter college, she moved to Chicago, and I stayed in St Louis (our home city) for school and after graduation. Joe and I ended up in the same post-bacc program. We quickly became  good friends, and I honestly forgot that he had ever dated my sister. We started dating after a few months, and it\u2019s the best relationship I\u2019ve ever been in. We\u2019ve been together for four years, and lived together for two. He proposed in October and I said yes. \n\nWhen we started dating, my sister didn\u2019t really react to the news. She saw us together at holidays, and while she and I didn\u2019t speak much, she didn\u2019t seem upset. But then, last week, we got both of our families together and announced our engagement. Jen and my brothers all managed to be in St Louis for the weekend. After the announcement, while everyone else was congratulating us, she glared and asked to talk to me in the other room. She asked if I was \u201ctrying to hurt her\u201d or if I just didn\u2019t care about her. I asked what she meant and she said something like \u201cwhat kind of person marries her sister\u2019s ex boyfriend?\u201d Up until that point, I had never even considered the fact that they dated in high school. I told her that she had never said anything to me in the last four years, and that it had been over a decade since they dated. It quickly turned into a screaming match between us, as usual. She called me a heartless bitch, and said not to invite her to the wedding. I said something something awful about how no one would want her there anyway before my mom stepped in and ended the whole party. \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve gotten mixed responses. Some of my family have defended Jen and said that I should have never started dating her ex in the first place. Others have said that she should\u2019ve said something before we were engaged, and that she just hates that I\u2019m getting married before her.

I agree with some folks that it was years ago and that she should be over it, but humans don't always work like that and some breakups really do leave scars.\n\nIt would've made sense to at least talk to your sister about him/the breakup before y'all started dating. I can totally see your sister's point - the optics of the relationship and the engagement really do display how little you care about her feelings. \n\nI'm sorry, but YTA.", "No matter how bad your relationship with your sibling is, nobody should ever date their siblings ex. Doesn't matter that it was in high school and that \"you forgot.\"\nThis guy has you fooled into thinking he doesn't remember why they broke up \ud83d\ude02 he's playing it off as if it's so irrelevant to him.

There's a huge difference between if they broke up over a fight, or if they broke up because she got pregnant and he pushed her to have an abortion.  Just using an extreme example, because her reaction to your engagement is so out of proportion for a \"normal\" high school relationship.\n\nBut after 4yrs together if it had been something extreme she should have had the decency to contact you and told you about it.  So you're not at fault for living your life and being happy.  If I were you, I'd still want to know what happened.  Especially because he claims he doesn't remember.  No one forgets their first big breakup and in the comments you said they dated for the first 3 years of high school.  That's a memorable relationship and likely the first big breakup he ever had.  It sounds like there is a reason he doesn't want you to know what happened.", "Incest by proxy", "YTA!!! \nI would never even think about being with someone my sister kissed, let alone dated and had sex with, it\u2019s disgusting. You just don\u2019t do that to your siblings, no matter what.", "I really don't even have to read this, YTA. It's your sisters ex...

It doesn\u2019t sound like it. Then you two announce you\u2019re engaged, and she\u2019s hurt.\n\nYes, this was years ago from what you\u2019re saying. But you yourself don\u2019t know the specifics as to what happened while they dated, and how it ended. YOU should have been the adult and talked with both of them so that you could have mitigated this damage. If this was her first boyfriend, there could absolutely be feelings still there. Goodness, maybe she was pregnant, had a miscarriage and he broke up with her. You have no idea because you didn\u2019t take time to figure it out and work towards a smooth transition for all involved.\n\nYour sister sucks because this has been years and she still must have unresolved feelings for her ex.", "They could of broke up cuz ur sister was planning to leave for college and he wasn't and didn't want her to leave. She did. They fight, words exchanged, break up. Ur sister was probably in love with him, maybe still is. If he was her first love. YTA for dating ur sister ex, u shouldn't have started.

All I can say is congratulations and good luck.", "Personally, even if she wasn\u2019t my sister, I wouldn\u2019t date anyone who dated someone I knew.\n\nWith the being said, there was a situation when my bff knew I dated this guy.  Before she wanted to pursue she called and kept pretty regularly asking if it was ok if she dated him.  I never really cared for the guy, so I was like go right ahead and I was rooting for the relationship.\n\nWhat makes you the asshole, is you\u2019re in every sentence keep mentioning how much you and your sister don\u2019t get along.  It\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to justify to yourself what you did.  People who speak like that in a justifying mannerism sound like they know their guilt.\n\nMy thing is, even if you didn\u2019t speak, the least you could\u2019ve done was to ask if she was ok with this relationship unfolding. Her seeing you together at gathering doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s ok, at the very most she might not have even known it was serious.  Sounds like you\u2019re pretty selfish.", "You\u2019re a sleaze bag. You\u2026 forgot they dated in hs? How phony. You knew they dated when you met him in grad school and he knew too. That\u2019s literally how you two recognized each other and part of how you got together. I\u2019m sure that morphed into love over time and your relationship is not based on a mutual grudge towards your sister. Then\u2026 well\u2026 you forgot they ever dated! Funny how that works. \n\nTo clarify a few things for your ego: Your family turning up to the wedding and not abandoning you does not mean you\u2019re a good person. If some of your family tells you that it\u2019s on her in some way, that doesn\u2019t mean this is okay- it means they\u2019re closer to you than her. \n\nI think you\u2019re omitting your history with your sister and what you said to her because not even you, with your remarkable capacity to forget, can gloss over your involvement in whatever you think she did to you in childhood. \n\nIt\u2019s really easy not to date the the exes of close friends and family members, been there, you have a brain and decline their advances. And then move on because there\u2019s plenty of fish in the sea.", "YTA you are coming off shady af in your post. You claim you \"forgot\" that was your sisters ex, and your fiance claims he doesn't \"remember\" dating your sister.\nI call bullshit. You both remember, but are just pretending you dont because you both know you guys are in the wrong. You want to save face.\nYou don't date a siblings' ex if they bumped uglies.\nAll this could have been solved if you had just had a conversation with your sister when you first started dating her ex. Maybe at one of the family gatherings, since you're not close. Giving her a heads up when it first occurred would have been the decent thing to do. You just started bringing her ex to family functions and assumed she was alright with it. And both pretend to have amnesia about her and you fiance dating.

She doesn\u2019t get to decide you can\u2019t be in love with someone she dated as a kid. I think she is upset that you are marrying before her, and this is a \u201cI don\u2019t want him but I also don\u2019t want you to have him\u201d situation.

You initially say you aren\u2019t sure how long they dated but then commented it was about freshman year to end of junior year. Did you even talk to your sister about dating him before it happened and got serious? \n\nI\u2019m sorry but there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d date my sisters ex and so I definitely wouldn\u2019t even think to date her high school sweetheart, let alone agree to marry him. It\u2019s even sketchier that your fianc\u00e9e claims he doesn\u2019t remember why they broke up but I\u2019m calling BS bc how do you have zero memory about why one of your longest childhood friendships and the high school romance ended? And how do YOU accept that? How do YOU live with that kind of obvious lie? \n\nMy gut says that he hurt your sister in a traumatic way and you\u2019re blindingly allowing him to continue hurting her.

We\u2019ll call him Joe. Our families were very close, so we essentially grew up together. He and my sister (30F) were closer in age, so they were much closer as kids than he and I were, and they ended up dating in high school. I wasn\u2019t really privy to much of their romance, because my sister and I hardly spoke to each other except when we were arguing, but I do know they had a pretty nasty break up and weren\u2019t friends anymore after the fact. \n\nMy sister, Jen, and I aren\u2019t close. We had a lot of problems growing up that I don\u2019t really need to get into here because I don\u2019t want to skew anyone\u2019s opinion about THIS situation. I only know our problems from my side, so of course they\u2019re gonna be bias. But, long story short, we don\u2019t get along. We\u2019re civil at family gatherings, and it\u2019s not like we can\u2019t be in the same room without fighting, we just choose not to spend extended amounts of time with each other or hang out alone. So, I don\u2019t know really anything about her or her life, and it\u2019s been that way pretty much since we both left home. \n\nAfter college, she moved to Chicago, and I stayed in St Louis (our home city) for school and after graduation. Joe and I ended up in the same post-bacc program. We quickly became  good friends, and I honestly forgot that he had ever dated my sister. We started dating after a few months, and it\u2019s the best relationship I\u2019ve ever been in. We\u2019ve been together for four years, and lived together for two. He proposed in October and I said yes. \n\nWhen we started dating, my sister didn\u2019t really react to the news. She saw us together at holidays, and while she and I didn\u2019t speak much, she didn\u2019t seem upset. But then, last week, we got both of our families together and announced our engagement. Jen and my brothers all managed to be in St Louis for the weekend. After the announcement, while everyone else was congratulating us, she glared and asked to talk to me in the other room. She asked if I was \u201ctrying to hurt her\u201d or if I just didn\u2019t care about her. I asked what she meant and she said something like \u201cwhat kind of person marries her sister\u2019s ex boyfriend?\u201d Up until that point, I had never even considered the fact that they dated in high school. I told her that she had never said anything to me in the last four years, and that it had been over a decade since they dated. It quickly turned into a screaming match between us, as usual. She called me a heartless bitch, and said not to invite her to the wedding. I said something something awful about how no one would want her there anyway before my mom stepped in and ended the whole party. \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve gotten mixed responses. Some of my family have defended Jen and said that I should have never started dating her ex in the first place. Others have said that she should\u2019ve said something before we were engaged, and that she just hates that I\u2019m getting married before her.
