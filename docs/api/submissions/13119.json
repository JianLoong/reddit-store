{"id": 13119, "submission_id": "1213uwa", "title": "AITA for \u201couting\u201d a colleague for using a food assistance program?", "selftext": "I (56 male) volunteer at a local non-profit that gives food to different populations. We have a free educator day, where anyone in education can come and get groceries. \n\nI volunteered last week and noticed a young colleague (he\u2019s probably in his late 20s) in the line and in the store. I had to check his badge and confirmed it was him. He nodded and said hey, then kept \u201cshopping\u201d. I noticed he didn\u2019t grab as much as others and only grabbed basics. He grabbed like eggs, radishes, kale, milk, coffee, some frozen samosas, hummus, yogurt etc. Usually it\u2019s very hectic with people shoving over \u201cluxury items\u201d but I noticed he was calm, even when people knocked him and his cane (he is disabled). Usually people go for chips, ice cream, soda and it was rough watching him skip those and go for the groceries he went for. \n\nHe didn\u2019t fight though. Just waited his turn and if they were out of something he looked to the woman he was with and would discuss with her what made sense. And I noticed he didn\u2019t grab nearly as much as other people, who usually bring their teacher carts and load up everything they can. Sometimes for people who aren\u2019t teachers but their families. \n\nThis program is for educators but I\u2019m confused as to why he needs it. When I saw him in the office, talking to students, eating on his lunch break. Eating the yogurt he grabbed and even giving one of the yogurts to a student. \n\nOnce students were out of his office hours, I mentioned in front of colleagues that I saw him at the program and he was making use of it. He looked embarrassed. Didn\u2019t say much. And put away the pieces of melon he was eating. \n\nLater this week, another colleague fussed me for harassing the younger colleague. Saying I didn\u2019t need to embarrass him like that. She also suggested that as professors, he probably doesn\u2019t make as much as we do since he is younger and openly genderqueer. I don\u2019t think there is any way to prove there is any discrimination and we don\u2019t know each other\u2019s salaries. And I actually don\u2019t like that part, cause a lot of the educators that come through are women who need to feed their families. He doesn\u2019t have a family that I know of. For all I know, he makes what I make. And I feel like he is using something he shouldn\u2019t be using. \n\nAITA for outing this colleague for using this food assistance program?", "created_utc": 1679702709, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1213uwa/aita_for_outing_a_colleague_for_using_a_food/", "score": 1211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe he has huge school debts, maybe huge medical debts. \n\nHe also was using it responsibility and for necessities. \n\nThis sounds like none of your business and you are the AH for broadcasting it and embarrassing him.", "YTA. You shamed him for needing assistance without knowing his circumstances. That is vile. Vile. Please stop volunteering at a food bank, you are way too judgmental to be doing so.", "Absolutely YTA. I can\u2019t imagine a world where it\u2019s appropriate to embarrass someone for receiving assistance.  If you feel educators don\u2019t need to take advantage of the program due to how much money they are making(not that it\u2019s your place to judge people\u2019s needs) take that up with the program manager don\u2019t take it upon yourself to question & embarrass those utilizing it.", "YTA\n\nYou don't know his situation.  You don't know what he makes (my friends in academia made peanuts when they were just starting, and your colleague seems to think this would be the case for him as well).  You don't know what expenses he has that eat into that (his disability may require regular medical care, medications, or purchasing expensive aids; he may not be able to live in super cheap living situations for health/accessibility reasons).  And you don't know who he is supporting at home.  \n\nI think it's pretty reasonable that a young professor with a disability may need food assistance.  And I think it speaks to his character how polite he was in that challenging situation and how restrained he was with the assistance he took.  \n\nSpeaks to your character too that you would hassle him about this.", "So...you're upset someone you know has made use of a community resource for those who need it?  He bypassed the more sought after items and only shopped for basic necessities...which was problematic why?\n\nYTA. What puts you in a place to judge or comment?   It's hard enough for many folks to even make use of needed resources EXACTLY because they fear people questioning why they are there or if they're deserving of help.", "YTA\n\nIn they way you 'told on him' because he was polite and disabled, and genderqueer, and did not violently assault anyone ahead of him getting items he wanted.\n\nWhat is wrong with you? I'm seriously asking, not being sarcastic. You are judging someone about being polite and only taking items they needed and not 'piling their cart up' with ice cream and junk food. \n\nI really hope he goes to HR with this on the basis of: You openly discussed a coworkers private life and finances with other coworkers, because he is disabled and genderqueer and probably below the poverty line. Every one of those points you as clearly discriminating, you could lose your job, or at the very least get a documenting warning for your behavior and trying to create a hostile work environment.\n\nI started to make a huge numbered list of all the shit you said that was just plain wrong, but...YOU KNOW. go back and ready, you KNOW.", "YTA - If I ran the volunteers at the program you were at, I would not ask you to come back.  People that use assistance programs should be given confidentiality and dignity, you don't know his personal situation and even if you did, you violated a trust you are given when you volunteer.  Honestly, how dare you.", "YTA, mind your own business. Many people feel embarrassment or shame for needing to use food banks. You should better educate yourself if you\u2019re volunteering there. You admit to not knowing this man\u2019s situation, so why are you speaking about it to others?\n\n\nAlso, why is it \u201crough\u201d to watch him make smart food choices?", "Yeah of course YTA\n\nIt was for educators. He's an educator. End of discussion. \n\nYou're mad a disabled young man is getting food assistance?", "I need a shower after reading your description of his shopping habits, hoping he reports you to the organization you volunteered for and you get \u2018fired\u2019, you sound so creepy \n\nYTA", "YTA. it\u2019s ironic that you keep talking about how you don\u2019t know his situation - because\u2026\u2026 exactly, you don\u2019t. so stop assuming and learn how to mind your own damn business", "YTA\n\nI can think of a lot of reasons why a young educator might need a food pantry considering I'm also a young educator. For one, I find it pretty unlikely that he's making the same pay as you (especially if \"professor\" is being used in the American sense, meaning college professor). Second, a young educator is likely to have student loans to pay off as well as other expenses typical of having left school for a career. Then there's the fact that he might have additional costs due to his disability (again, depending on health coverage in your country). \n\nI'm very confused by why you focused so much on his items. He skipped the chips and got yogurt. So what? How is this proof that he's somehow misusing the pantry? You state he's too calm. Well, for one, he appears to be going after less popular items. Second, he is limited by his disability--he can't exactly make a mad dash for an item. Again, how is this proof of misuse? Third, you state he didn't grab as much as other people as if it were suspicious, but also state he doesn't have a family...so of course he wouldn't need as much as other people. Which might also explain why he was calmer than others, as he didn't need to grab as much (or grab kid-friendly options). And he gave a student food. Maybe the student also has food insecurity issues, and he's being empathetic and generous. \n\nIf you suspect he is misusing the service, then I'm sure there are appropriate people to take the issue up with. Putting him on the spot in front of his colleagues was not the appropriate response.", "YTA.  You had zero reason to bring up his business with everyone.  You embarrassed him, for what?  What were you hoping to gain from telling everyone he has food insecurity?", "YTA. He's disabled, his sexuality/gender doesn't matter at all in this discussion, and food insecurity is a huge issue in the entire world, which is why there's food banks in the first place. You don't know his living situation; bills, rent, car payments, debts, loans. Nope. You think that because someone works with you and isn't a 'breeding female with a family obligation' that puts them lower on the scale. I'm trying to figure out your stance, tbh. He was gathering healthy foods, not pushing for foods, taking what he needed, not overloading himself, not going for shit crap food, and you're judging him and giving him shit in public about that? You think because you work there that makes you better than him? Or that he shouldn't have the need for it because he's not popping out kids, so he clearly doesn't matter as a human being?\n\nYou're very outdated in your views and on the pulse of the financial status of people a generation under you.", "YTA Your deliberately brought up something to embarrass him in front of co-workers. You do not know his circumstances and you brought up information that you should have kept to yourself.", "YTA.  How dare you judge or make assumptions about his financials.  Your decision to turn him was a serious breach of confidentiality.", "Wow YTA. \n\nAnd didn't you breach some code of ethics by outing a customer at the place you volunteer? Don't they at least give you some training on how to treat people? \n\nAnd most of all, it's none of your fucking business.", "YTA and if I were the volunteer coordinator/ supervisor at that organization I would be extremely disappointed by (and probably \"fire\") any volunteer who I found out was gossiping about patrons of the program. Extremely unprofessional, they deserve privacy.", "YTA\n\nThis disabled  educator took advantage of a program he was eligible for. He had a right to be there. YOU DID NOT. Remember you are a volunteer they dont need your kind of help. \n\nFurthermore, that young man would be well within his right to report you and ask you be removed from the non profit for that EXACT reason.\n\nYou want to prove you're NTA apologize to him. Infront of everyone. Until then YTA!!!", "&#x200B;\n\n>he is disabled\n\nDo you know how expensive it is to be disabled? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA. Even people without a family to feed need to eat.", "YTA. \u201cFor all I know he makes what I make and I feel he is using something he shouldn\u2019t be\u201d \n\nYou know nothing about his situation. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a family that I know of\u201d so you don\u2019t know enough about him to know for certain if he has a family? Yet you feel like you\u2019re entitled to pass judgment? You clearly said this to your colleague in hopes of rallying support for your baseless opinion which clearly hasnt worked. Mind your damn business. I sure hope you never need to avail of this kind of support only to have nasty coworkers gossip about you.", "Hey why don't you mind your own business? YTA.", "YTA.\n\nYou don't know what he makes and have no idea what is going on in his personal life.  For all you know, every paycheck could be going to pay off student loans, leaving him with no budget for food.  Maybe he does have kids.  Maybe he cares for an elderly parent or a sibling.  You don't know, and it's not your right to know either.\n\nI hope that colleague reports YOU to management for your inappropriate behavior.", "Well\u2026yes because it\u2019s at the very least none of your business.", "YTA. There is nothing wrong if someone needs to use such a program to get by. That is what those programs are there for. It is none of your business, nor anyone else's, that they use such a program.", "Your food bank likely has rules for behavior for their volunteers.  You likely broke them by publicly shaming one of their clients.\n\n\nSince you want this guy to follow the rules, pls report yourself to the food bank\n\n\nYTA", "You have without doubt guaranteed this person will likely never again avail himself of a resource he obviously needs. So, in one fell swoop, you managed to embarrass your colleague, undermine the credibility of the organization (for having someone so judgmental of the population they are trying to help), and shown your colleagues just how much character you lack. Congratulations! You are both an AH of the highest order and none too bright.", "Omg what a horrible thing to do YTA. Why would it even cross your mind to think it's OK to comment on someone's use of such a program. He should complain about you and have you removed from it, before you judge and bring down even more people.\n\nYou have zero idea why he needs the assistance, and you want to know something else, it has F all to do with you.", "YTA.  If I knew where you were volunteering, I would call them and tell them you are deliberately and  publicly humiliating people that use the service.  That's foul, real foul.\n\nIf you are so confidant, show them what you wrote and see what they have to say.", "YTA, a huge, judgmental, know-it-all TA who knows nothing about your colleague's life.  You are making assumptions you have no right to make and openly shaming someone you have no right to shame.  Then, you gossiped about someone at your joint place of work.  Do you realize how completely unprofessional and unethical that is?  You lack empathy and good judgment. I truly hope you stick to your subject matter because you aren't fit to teach your students anything else.  You are also not the kind of person who should not be allowed to volunteer at a food pantry and, if you don't have the decency to stop volunteering on your own, I truly hope someone reports to the non-profit and that you are asked not to return.", "YTA\n\nFor a few reasons. \n\n1. It's for educators and he's an educator. Does it say anything only being for \"educators OP approves of?\"\n\n2. You have NO right to share ANYONE who is using a food assistance program. You should seriously rethink volunteering there if you can't understand this basic rule.\n\n3. You don't know what he makes. (Nor is it an income dependent program.) You don't get to gatekeep on the basis of thinking he doesn't look like he needs it \n\nYou sound incredibly arrogant and oblivious. (I hope you're oblivious.)", "YTA, what people do or don\u2019t do with their funds and resources is quite literally none of your business. People do what they need to do to get by and you do not get to decide exactly what that is based on your own personal assumptions of their life. \n\nthe hubble telescope can see your ignorance rn, bub", "YTA and I\u2019m ashamed of you for butting into someone\u2019s private life simply because you think you know best. You\u2019re \u201cconfused\u201d as to why he needed it? Is that in any way relevant to your work as a volunteer? Is it any of your business at all? At the least, you should have looked away pretended you didn\u2019t see him there at all. Instead you watched his every move. Jeez. I\u2019m super annoyed at your attitude right now. Do better. Be better.", "Yes, YTA. I mean, you don't know why the person was using the food bank, so just let them be.  Judgy people like you trying to decide who \"deserves\" help are just the worst.  And a late 20 year old doesn't make what you make, but I'm pretty sure you know that already.", "YTA.\n\nYou're a volunteer.  No one has hired you to gatekeep the charity.  You're just there to help distribute the food, not interrogate the people who get it.\n\nHe doesn't have a family *that you know of*, but you aren't omniscent.  For all you know, he has kids.  For all you know, he's caring for elderly parents and or disabled spouse who is unable to work.  And also for all you know, he makes considerably less than you and/or he's carrying a ton of student or medical debt.  And it is kind of crazy to assume he makes the same as you anyway.  You've got almost 30 years on him.  \n\nEven if the guy is filthy rich, you admit he didn't take that much food.  And he didn't take food that is in high demand.  It's such a strange and unhealthy thing to get worked up about.", "Omg YTA way to scrutinize his eating habits and embarrass him.", "YTA\n\nWhat business is it of yours? You embarrassed him for using an assistance program without knowing anything about him. \n\nThis says more about you than him.", "Hard yta, your judgmental comments (at his workplace, no less!) are exactly what prevent people who need food banks from using them. He shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed, but you sure should be.", "YTA - How would you like the state of your finances shared about with your colleagues? Not so much?", "YTA.... Mind your business!!!", "Yta. Please stay out of volunteering if you're just going to gatekeep who is worthy of assistance.", "YTA. There is something seriously wrong with you. Who are you to judge anyone and then share his private business with others?", "Yes, definitely an AH. You should have just talked to him in private. And, your commentary on his shopping is down right creepy. Did you stare at him the entire time?", "YTA. I bet you are one of those people who tells everyone all about your altruism, any chance you get. \nYou had absolutely no reason to try to embarrass him by stating he uses assistance. Most younger professors here don\u2019t make a living wage. Instead of trying to change the academic system you are a part of to ensure people make a living wage, you decided to be a pompous asshole and try to shake him. \n\nI hope the head of the org sees this, or he files a complaint, because you should not be allowed to volunteer there if you are this incredibly judgmental and can\u2019t understand why confidentiality would be wise and ethical. Ugh. You are the worst kind of person\u2026 all sweet on the outside and rotten to the core inside.", "Yta so he used a program that he is qualified to use and you mentioned it why?  Because he isn't a woman with a family to feed?  So? He's a dude. Who need to eat.  You don't *need* to understand.  \n\nYou know exactly jack shit about this person's personal life and finances.  If you were my volunteer you would be asked to not come back.", " You are a horrible snob who seems to be volunteering as a signal of virtue that you clearly don\u2019t possess. For sure, you\u2019re TA", "The female educators must \"have families to feed\"?????\n\nHe can't have a family because he is \"genderqueer\"????\n\nHe can't be in need if he is single???\n\nAnd so you decided to humiliate your colleague because you  named yourself the arbiter of need and were not sufficiently satisfied.\n\nYou have absolutely no business anywhere near the food bank. Your behavior was elitist, bigoted, and disgustingly judgemental.\n\nMind your own business next time and keep your mouth shut. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Fuck's sake.", "YTA. What the hell is wrong with you? You're not only an AH your also a creep", "YTA.  Good lord, you have a disabled colleague and you think it\u2019s inappropriate for him to use a food pantry?\n\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\nIs your colleague a tenured professor or getting some kind of sweet fellowship that pays him oodles of money?  If you don\u2019t know, shut your mouth. \n\nGood god.", "The vast majority of people would prefer to not use food assistance programs. I'm shocked that as a volunteer you weren't trained in the stigma and shame that follows people who require this service. \n\nWhat you did was based on ignorance and was cruel.  What if this person needs to go again!?  They now don't consider that a safe space. \n\nYTA. The program needs to do a better job of training everyone who is working or volunteering there.", "YTA. The man faces enough challenges in an environment in which even food pantries turn out to have judgmental spice. Can you not leave him his dignity? What you did was terrible.", "YTA and a jerk. You basically humiliated the guy in front of others. You should apologize in front of the same people and stay the hell away from the food bank. They don\u2019t need judgmental assholes like you.", "YTA and a terrible coworker", "YTA - Let's say you went to the doctors, and for whatever reason the door was slightly open and a colleague overheard the doctor telling you that you have and STI. Does that mean they can share that information with everyone at lunch? Sometimes you hear or see things that don't need to be said to other people. Just cos you heard it, doesn't mean you have a right to share it.\n\nI'll give another example, just incase the last one doesn't cut it. Let's say you are at an ATM getting money out, it pops up showing your balance is 1$ and you can't get any money out. You walk away ashamed. The person behind you is your colleague, they saw you have no money and you couldn't get cash out. Would you want them sharing that information with everyone at lunch? I don't think so.\n\nIf you're trying to get your \"Holier than thou\" fix by volunteering for these things so you can sh!t on people. Do everyone a favour and mind your damn business :)\n\nYTA", "YTA.  even if you did know his salary (which you don't), you have no idea of his personal financial situation or know if he does indeed need that free food in order to eat enough based on his personal circumstances.  or to feed others that may live with him.", "YTA.

You don't know his situation, and it's none of your business. You make a lot of assumptions. A 20something educator may be making less money than your average waiter.

When I volunteered at the food bank, we had a confidentiality clause, we weren\u2019t to talk about our clients. You have a big mouth. And you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to work there any more.", "you mention that he is disabled. if you are living in the us, it is possible that even if he is making as much as you, it is going towards medical expenses primarily. a lot of disabled people are cut off from aid programs due to earning \u201ctoo much\u201d despite how expensive care can be. \n\nthe bottom line is that you do not know his financial situation. you could have chosen to be empathetic and respectful, but you instead chose to publicly embarrass someone. if you\u2019re going to have some form of expectation for the people you serve, maybe you should not.

That rent (not a mortgage - this generation will struggle to own property) is taking up at least 70+% of household income, that student debt is exponentially higher than when you went to school, or that people who you would least expect are paying for gym memberships just for the shower facilities because they live in their car.   \n\nI\u2019m not even going to go into the fact that you think they\u2019re getting paid the same as you.\n\nYou need to take that education of yours and put it to good use, and actually get educated on real life.

We have a free educator day, where anyone in education can come and get groceries. \n\nI volunteered last week and noticed a young colleague (he\u2019s probably in his late 20s) in the line and in the store. I had to check his badge and confirmed it was him. He nodded and said hey, then kept \u201cshopping\u201d. I noticed he didn\u2019t grab as much as others and only grabbed basics. He grabbed like eggs, radishes, kale, milk, coffee, some frozen samosas, hummus, yogurt etc. Usually it\u2019s very hectic with people shoving over \u201cluxury items\u201d but I noticed he was calm, even when people knocked him and his cane (he is disabled). Usually people go for chips, ice cream, soda and it was rough watching him skip those and go for the groceries he went for. \n\nHe didn\u2019t fight though. Just waited his turn and if they were out of something he looked to the woman he was with and would discuss with her what made sense. And I noticed he didn\u2019t grab nearly as much as other people, who usually bring their teacher carts and load up everything they can. Sometimes for people who aren\u2019t teachers but their families. \n\nThis program is for educators but I\u2019m confused as to why he needs it. When I saw him in the office, talking to students, eating on his lunch break. Eating the yogurt he grabbed and even giving one of the yogurts to a student. \n\nOnce students were out of his office hours, I mentioned in front of colleagues that I saw him at the program and he was making use of it. He looked embarrassed. Didn\u2019t say much. And put away the pieces of melon he was eating. \n\nLater this week, another colleague fussed me for harassing the younger colleague. Saying I didn\u2019t need to embarrass him like that. She also suggested that as professors, he probably doesn\u2019t make as much as we do since he is younger and openly genderqueer. I don\u2019t think there is any way to prove there is any discrimination and we don\u2019t know each other\u2019s salaries. And I actually don\u2019t like that part, cause a lot of the educators that come through are women who need to feed their families. He doesn\u2019t have a family that I know of. For all I know, he makes what I make. And I feel like he is using something he shouldn\u2019t be using. \n\nAITA for outing this colleague for using this food assistance program?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA, you don\u2019t know his life or what he goes through. I grew up with food insecurity myself and when you said he put his melon away my heart sank. You have no idea what it feels like and be glad you don\u2019t. Do not ever shame someone for needs food. May God bestow the same kindness on you that you showed this young man.", "YTA for such a disgusting violation of someone\u2019s privacy.

Or asks how your erectile dysfunction meds are working at the water cooler, lest you experience something similar.", "YTA. I reas the title and already decided this. Then I read the story and noticed how you were judging people using the program to get food they wanted. As if people aren\u2019t allowed to enjoy their food because it\u2019s free.

I hope nobody takes your classes ever again, asshole.", "YTA As a volunteer, it's your duty to serve the people who show up; not judge them or try to discredit their needs.

Never. In addition, you shouldn\u2019t out someone in public. You can have a respectful, private conversation if needed, but this situation did not need that.

How dare you judge him. You do not know his circumstances. You said he was disabled, do you know how much his medical bills are? His medications? No you don't.

You also do not have the right to demand that they fit a certain stereotype in order to partake.
