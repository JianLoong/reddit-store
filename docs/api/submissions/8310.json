I was clear from the beginning that me being quiet wasn't anything to do with him, it was just a problem with me. He said everything was fine.

When you started the call you should have said you were dealing with some stuff so would be quiet. And he could then have had a choice about whether he wanted to continue the call or not. \nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect you to always be happy so you can give him attention and validation. It\u2019s normal for everyone to have down days, including therapists. If he can\u2019t deal with that then I\u2019d seriously reconsider the relationship. \n\nI\u2019d also add if someone says something like that it would be useful to ask exactly them what they mean by it and make them explain fully. Be curious and find out rather than going straight into yelling.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not his therapist, you\u2019re his gf. And if he can\u2019t tell the difference, he does need a therapist.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s a weird comment, and weirder that he\u2019s made it before and disregarded you every time you stood up for yourself. Might be worth a more focused chat where he\u2019s not playing a game and can actually pay attention to you when you bring up this issue. Sometimes people need to really focus to hear the depth of your concern for something. Give him that chance, but if he dismisses it then I\u2019d start considering it a red flag.", "If you want to be quiet, why even bother face time?  That just seems to set the expectation to interact. If that happened to me, I would feel like you were wasting my time. I could see where it would make someone uncomfortable. If you want to be quiet, why not just not leave him alone? Message him and say you need some time for yourself. Then when you feel like talking, see if he wants to facetime.\n\nI think he was using the counselor statement to say he didn't like you calling and being quiet.", "NTA- But I also think your boyfriend isn\u2019t like evil. The comment was distasteful and most likely a failed joke, talking things out I think could greatly benefit both of yall", "NTA\n\nLet him know that passive aggressive comments are not okay. If he has an issue with something, then he should just say it. This is not a healthy way to talk to someone you have a romantic relationship with.", "NTA. But your boyfriend is and he\u2019s toying with you. Your wanting to make him happy is backfiring because he wants it to. It\u2019s against the rules here to advise  you to break up with him, but I would give some serious thought to this relationship.", "NTA. You aren't your boyfriend's therapist.

Just some clarifiers, though, I did say that I was upset and was probably gonna be quiet, and I didn't yell when he said the comment; I got upset but remained pretty calm.

Honestly if you just lay out exactly how you felt about what he said like you did in this this post it would probably clear up a lot of possible confusion. Communication is key, and if you\u2019re prone to not talking in your relationship then you might be saying a lot more in your head than to him about exactly why you feel the way you feel.
