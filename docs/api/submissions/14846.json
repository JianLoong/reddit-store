The other girl is trying to dump her frustration of losing her \"friends\" at you, which is childish.", "NTA. Because tbh, speaking and comprehension aren't necessarily in tandem at all. Like I can't speak Spanish for shit anymore, but I can absolutely understand it when people are speaking it to a high extent. So if they're getting pissed at you for understanding what they were saying, that's entirely not on you. It's not your obligation to tell everyone how fluent you are in any language. If someone is being shitty and you understand what they're saying, you're 1000% allowed to call it out.", "NTA. At all. They weren't her friends if they were talking about her like that.\n\nMy husband has similar stories. We are American, his step grandma is from Argentina and took him there to live when he was little. As a result, he is fluent in Spanish. But, you would never know it looking at the \"big, white guy\".  He worked in a construction field for a while. Oh, the stores he has.", "NTA, well done.  They're mortified at being caught out and taking it out on you.", "NTA.\n\nYou were honest to Sofia and only wanted to protect her from these people. If she can\u2018t see that, that\u2018s on her. Your classmates are AHs.", "NTA. But a toxic group of people that you really should ignore.", "NTA. She'd rather think she has friends. Then know for a fact she doesn't. I worked with a Korean back in the day. A group came in talking Spanish saying what they were stealing. He asks me what to do. I said when they come to the register ask how they like to pay for the stolen stuff. The look he got. And yes, they paid for everything. He only spoke 5 languages fluently.", "From what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like these girls were being really exclusive and rude about their Spanish. If they\u2019re going to exclude people from their conversations just because they don\u2019t speak Spanish, they shouldn\u2019t be surprised when someone overhears them speaking badly about everyone else. You did the right thing by telling Sofia about their gossip and her lashing out at you for it just proves how rude she and her friends were being. You\u2019re definitely NTA in this situation, and if they want to blame you for their own bad behavior, then they\u2019re just being childish", "So Sofia is angry that you gave her a heads up that her so-called friends were calling her a whore? Jesus. NTA.", " Next time keep it to yourself. People shoot the messenger. Or start speaking Spanish and let them know you understand them.", "Maybe TA alittle by easedropping and passing along their mean-spirited conversation.

What you did with the information you gave her was her choice. She could have ignored it, proceeded with caution with this group of girls or blew up her friendship which she chose to do. Here's a lesson learned for everyone in the International School, you never know who knows your language and when you're talking shit about people publicly (and frankly privately), that can get back to the person.", "Right? NTA but this is why you don\u2019t get in between shit like this. It\u2019s so likely to get turned around and you end up like the bad guy!", "The question is, *should* people shoot the messenger? Because if they shouldn't then why is it OP's problem that people tend to anyway?", "Is it eavesdropping when they're talking in a public place and loud enough for anyone to hear? I don't think so", "Maybe, but that doesn't make her an AH.", "I don\u2019t think this makes her the AH but it was naive to think she could get in the middle of a tight friend group this way and not experience any backlash. More than likely this is a common behavior in the group and getting involved won\u2019t change anything except draw their attention on her as a target.", "That was my thought as well. No good deed...", "It\u2019s her problem because she suffers the consequences for it. It\u2019s easy to stand on a moral mountain when it\u2019s not you getting attacked.", "People shouldn't shoot the messenger because the messenger has nothing to do with it. Everything OP said happened, wether or not they reported on it. It's not like if OP decided not to tell this Sofia, the whole initial conversation didn't happen. And it's OP's problem because now she's blamed for it, while she had nothing to do with it (she didn't partake in the gossip).\n\nThink of it this way: you see a car hit the parked car of your friend, which he's very proud of. Now, the whole \"don't shoot the messenger\" thing is if you tell him, he blames you for what happened, but if you don't tell him, his car still got hit.", "You can hear the conversation at the next table, its listening that makes it easedropping and passing that conversation along that makes it gossip.", "It does in my book it might not in your.", "I don\u2019t believe that people should shoot the messenger for exactly the reason you\u2019ve described. I asked that as a rhetorical question to raise the point to the person I\u2019m replying to. I couldn\u2019t just say \u201cwell people shouldn\u2019t shoot the messenger\u201d because for all I knew the person I was replying to could\u2019ve believed the opposite. Therefore I had to do it the way I did. But I do agree with you.", "I guess but if you hear ppl talking and listen to what their saying it's hard to suddenly stop and just tune it out even if you don't want to listen, and for gossip, idk I feel gossip is what the other girls were doing, the op just had the misfortune of hearing it and letting the target of the gossip know, trying to tell someone that their friends are talking shit about them doesn't necessarily make you a asshole, to each their own I guess", "The other girls are deff gossiping. Honestly, asshole is waaay too strong a word. It makes OP human and wanting to make friends in a really tough environment."]}
