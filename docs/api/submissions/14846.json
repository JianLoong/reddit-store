I'm sorry, but there's playing the devil's advocate and there's being stupid.", "NTA. That group is dense as shit. Anyone with even an intermediate understanding of Spanish will be able to parse some Portuguese", "NTA\n\nSofia didn't have friends before. The only difference now is she knows it.

Not your fault even if you didn\u2019t tell them imo", "Absolutely NTA.

They do, so not acknowledging that basic fact of human nature and taking it into account in human interactions is just dumb.", "I agree with everything you\u2019re saying about the girls being problematic and cliquish.

I don\u2019t assume he believed one particular side, I said they \u201ccould\u2019ve\u201d believed the opposite not they \u201cdid\u201d believe the opposite.
