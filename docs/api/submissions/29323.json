But it sounds pretty good, I'll have to see if my local korean place carries it", "Blood curds are pretty good, if prepared well. They taste like a firm tofu with a hint of iron. Not bloody at all. Duck blood doesn't smell as strong as pig blood and the best way to prepare it, imo is chinese xinjiang or sichuan style. Yummy....\n\nThere's a video from Chef Wang Gang on youtube where he prepares blood from fresh, if you're interested in watching.

Some may be cured depending on the specific preparation but generally speaking none of it is cooked or cured unless specified.", "None of that make any sense. \nThe fish in sushi/sashimi is definitely raw. Of course you can served cooked fish as sushi as well but that is not the norm.\nThere is also tartare, raw beef, mett and probably loads of other dishes with raw meat.

It's not like I complained; I'd just quietly take myself and a book outside for awhile, haha (to be fair, I probably did complain the first time, but once I knew she was still gonna eat it (it was her house after all), I just took myself outside).\n\nAnyway, upvoting because you mentioning blood sausage/black pudding triggered that memory.", "You can have my square sausage n I'll take the black pudding!
