It congeals in the stomach, so a fairly interesting medical article informed me some years ago. That could very well be untrue, so let me go on to the more practical side of things. Who wants soggy bagels? Who wants blood-crusted dried up bagels? Blood tastes awful (I'm not a cannibal, I've just had fillings lately which my gums were very big babies about).

There\u2019s also never a reason to use topical antibiotics like Neosporin. At best, it\u2019s painful and useless. At worst, it slows wound healing and precipitates scars. This goes for big wounds too actually, except that you do need to take those seriously and cover them. No topical antibiotics. Soap and water, change dressings.\n\nSorry got a little off topic there. Sucking on your wounds definitely doesn\u2019t help, but reflexively sucking on paper cuts and other little nicks to \u201cmake it feel better\u201d right after the prick is also probably not going to do a lot of damage.
