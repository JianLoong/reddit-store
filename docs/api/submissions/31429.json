People should always be able to go the bathroom without losing their seat.", "Unpopular opinion, but I\u2019m going to go with NTA. Even if the son was a child, you should still be allowed to sit in a seat that\u2019s not currently being occupied, especially since the lady only bothered to tell you after you had already sat down. I\u2019ve been in these types of situations before with my large family, if stuff like this happens we just take turns using whatever amount of seats we\u2019ve managed to snag.

Yes, it\u2019s okay to save seats.", "YTA The woman wasn't hoarding seats. She simply told you her son was sitting there and had left briefly to use the restroom.

However, keeping it after learning it was already occupied, YTA. However, now days with feminism and wanting people not to do gender disparity, this courtesy arguably is no longer in existence. Regardless of that courtesy, the right thing to so in this situation is to apologize to lady and politely get up once she advised it was \"saved\". I agree if the son had not even been sitting before the bathroom, \"save-sies\"\" is rude AF especially in crowded places with limited seating.", "YTA she was saving the seat for her kid and you acted like a kid. That\u2019s a legitimate reason for saving a seat. If someone gets up to go to the BR in a crowded theater do you think it\u2019s open season?", "YTA. There is nothing wrong with hold a seat while someone goes to the bathroom.", "YTA, when the airport is crowded and there are people sitting around an empty seat I always ask if someone is sitting there before claiming it as my own, that's the decent thing to do. \n\nIt sure sucks that the airport was crowded and you didn't have a place to sit, but people are allowed to keep someone's place while they go to the restroom or get a drink/snacks. They were not reserving a seat, the person was already sitting there but were only away for  a short period of time.", "YTA, we aren't calling fives on seats like when we were kids and you knew your cousin was gonna take your seat when you get up. Bro went to the bathroom. He got there first, if you want a seat I suggest arriving earlier, like they did.", "YTA. The woman wanted to sit with her son. Forcing a parent and child to move just because you wanted to make some weird point is cringy.", "YTA.

If there's no bag on the chair as a placeholder, you've relinquished rights to it. I can't believe these entitled people are calling YOU the entitled one!", "NTA. It was a busy airport, not a 2nd grade lunchroom.", "NTA - It is common in a public setting, like an airport that if you wish to have the seat 'saved' you place a piece of clothing or other personal items to show it is taken prompting a person to ask first if they can then take the seat.  You sat down in an empty seat, so how could you know?  That is the etiquette. They violated that simple rule.", "Did she have something in the seat claiming it for her son or was it just wide open? If wide open, NTA, because how were you to have known?", "First rule of airport seats: if it's not occupied by a person or thing it's open.\n\nWant to save a seat?  Put something on it.  \n\nDon't have something and you're saving for someone?  Put your leg on it. \n\nBy yourself and you need to go to the bathroom?  Unfortunately you're subject to the seating lottery unless you're brave enough to leave your stuff unattended. But be prepared for a chat with TSA if you do. \n\nNTA", "YTA. This isn\u2019t an on your feet, lose your seat situation.

It\u2019s common courtesy to ask if seats are taken when it\u2019s so full before sitting down.", "You stole someone's seat, obviously YTA.", "Meh.  NTA.  Airports are busy.  He's about to get on a plane and will be sitting down again.  As an adult anyone in this situation should be able to understand how sometimes demand outstrips supply.  Stand or sit on the floor, or go get upset at the entitled jerks that lie across seats or fill them up with bags.  Some people get their knickers in a twist about the most benign things.", "This is a judgement call.  We alternate going to the bathroom pre flight, so someone can watch the luggage.  Because you never know when there\u2019s a delay and you could be waiting another hour or more, I\u2019d want to sit with my party. \n\nI think the answer depends on the age of the son. If he\u2019s young, I would give him the seat when he gets back so he can sit with his family. If he\u2019s older, probably not.", "YTA. Getting through the process of an airport is taxing so anyone would have to get water or use the bathroom, her son claimed that chair first and you could use some compassion", "YTA. Do you always behave this entitled? Total dick move.", "You are TA.", "Personally I think if I left the seat it would have been fine for someone else to take it.", "What\u2019s cool is you can use your words and simply ask someone if a seat is occupied and if not they will move their items for you 9/10 times", "NTA, the kid left nothing on the seat to mark it as taken. His mom was right there so no risk of getting in trouble for leaving luggage unattended. If you don't leave something to mark your seat it is not your seat.", "I actually don\u2019t know if the person had been sitting their before I got their, just the claim of the counterparty.  That being said I have no reason to think they were lying", "You weren't. YTA.", "Wide open, nothing on the seat. She did not notice until we were sitting for a few seconds", "Okay but how is this relevant?", "Kinda rude?! I didn\u2019t ask.", "Why do I seriously doubt that. Also, YTA. This is not The Hunger Games. People do this sort of thing all the time because most of us know that it is completely reasonable.", "So if your mom left her seat for the bathroom, you would be ok with someone taking it and sitting next to you, ignoring you when you tell them she\u2019ll be right back? What if this were at a coffee/sandwich shop and you get up from your table for the bathroom, would you be ok with someone taking your seat to be at the table with your mom? While it might sound like a ridiculous comparison, in both scenarios seats are first come first serve, it\u2019s just more obviously not ok in the latter.\n\n Regardless of the above, I think there\u2019s an additional issue when it\u2019s a child. No clue what age the kid was (assuming probably older because he was able to go to the bathroom himself), but if he was younger you\u2019re now potentially making it more difficult for the mom to take care of her kid in a crowded airport.Not saying this last part necessarily applies to your case bc no idea of his age.", "And that thought process is exactly what makes you an asshole", "Also his mom was right there to hold his seat, so no reason to leave something to hold his place. YTA", "Hope that seat kept your bum nice and toasty! NTA.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like she was actively saving it then. I\u2019m on your side too", "The edit clarifying that the son was an adult and not a child didn't exist when I posted.", "Nope.", "Agree with the point on it being a kid, but in this case the person the seat was being saved for was around the same age as me. \n\nI think it is different when a public space is empty vs full.  For a coffee shop or any public space If the space is full I don\u2019t think someone should have rights to the space just because they were there and then decided to leave.  \n\nI see that I am in the minority on this here. My argument would be that everyone has equal claim to public space and we should default to maximize utilization of the scarce resource (seats)", "Why would a child get seating preference over an adult? How ridiculous. The parent can sit on the floor or stand if their little princeling is too precious to do so.", "Incorrect.", "This is correct, I clarified after seeing this. I agree with the ranking above", "So in general I agree with your last paragraph (I hate when people use public space poorly or selfishly, particularly when crowded), but this in my eyes is absolutely not that.\n\nGenuinely curious, but what is your cutoff for considering it leaving your seat? I think most people would delineate it by if the person was intending on coming back within a short period of time and has someone there to watch the seat. However, it seems like you have a different bar. E.g. if I stand up and take 1 step from my seat, does that seat now count as open and someone can slide in? Do I have to be out of sight from the seat for it to be ok? What if I\u2019m called to the front desk by the airline? Is peeing my pants the only way to keep the seat?\n\nNot trying to harp on the point (and obviously I\u2019m using extremes as examples) just curious where your divide is because I think that\u2019s the main difference you have with people in the comments. Re above: nobody disagrees that taking an actual empty seat is not an AH move, but we all disagree that it was empty", "No one disagrees that if someone leaves they have given up their seat, everyone disagrees that getting up from your seat to use the bathroom counts as leaving.", "Not what I said.\n\nIf you want an actual response I\u2019m willing to give it, but based on \u201clittle princeling is too precious\u201d it seems like you just want to be angry and deliberately misinterpret things.", "A kid can sit on the floor. End of story."]}
