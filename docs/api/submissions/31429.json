What if this were at a coffee/sandwich shop and you get up from your table for the bathroom, would you be ok with someone taking your seat to be at the table with your mom? While it might sound like a ridiculous comparison, in both scenarios seats are first come first serve, it\u2019s just more obviously not ok in the latter.\n\n Regardless of the above, I think there\u2019s an additional issue when it\u2019s a child. No clue what age the kid was (assuming probably older because he was able to go to the bathroom himself), but if he was younger you\u2019re now potentially making it more difficult for the mom to take care of her kid in a crowded airport.Not saying this last part necessarily applies to your case bc no idea of his age.", "And that thought process is exactly what makes you an asshole", "Also his mom was right there to hold his seat, so no reason to leave something to hold his place.

For a coffee shop or any public space If the space is full I don\u2019t think someone should have rights to the space just because they were there and then decided to leave.  \n\nI see that I am in the minority on this here. My argument would be that everyone has equal claim to public space and we should default to maximize utilization of the scarce resource (seats)", "Why would a child get seating preference over an adult? How ridiculous. The parent can sit on the floor or stand if their little princeling is too precious to do so.", "Incorrect.", "This is correct, I clarified after seeing this. I agree with the ranking above", "So in general I agree with your last paragraph (I hate when people use public space poorly or selfishly, particularly when crowded), but this in my eyes is absolutely not that.\n\nGenuinely curious, but what is your cutoff for considering it leaving your seat? I think most people would delineate it by if the person was intending on coming back within a short period of time and has someone there to watch the seat. However, it seems like you have a different bar. E.g. if I stand up and take 1 step from my seat, does that seat now count as open and someone can slide in? Do I have to be out of sight from the seat for it to be ok? What if I\u2019m called to the front desk by the airline? Is peeing my pants the only way to keep the seat?\n\nNot trying to harp on the point (and obviously I\u2019m using extremes as examples) just curious where your divide is because I think that\u2019s the main difference you have with people in the comments. Re above: nobody disagrees that taking an actual empty seat is not an AH move, but we all disagree that it was empty", "No one disagrees that if someone leaves they have given up their seat, everyone disagrees that getting up from your seat to use the bathroom counts as leaving.", "Not what I said.\n\nIf you want an actual response I\u2019m willing to give it, but based on \u201clittle princeling is too precious\u201d it seems like you just want to be angry and deliberately misinterpret things.", "A kid can sit on the floor. End of story.", "NTA.  Seats are for everyone", "YTA. And ppl saying you need to leave stuff on a seat to save it are idiots.  Just respect a fellow human and find a new seat or stand.  It\u2019s not the end of the world.", "That family is definitely laughing about the rude person at the airport to other people they're visiting.", "Definitely YTA.\n\nSome people in here think the ONLY way to save a seat is to put a thing on it? Talking and gesturing also works and is how most normal people interact when there is any misunderstanding.  Lots of people put items on seats they don't want on the floor or when they're hoping nobody will come take the seat beside them. In no way is putting an item on the seat the 'universal language' for saving a seat.\n\nEven if that is the case what if someone sat down not seeing the thing? Does that mean it wasn't reserved? If you don't speak up to clarify you were saving the seat, how would they know? According to you talking to clarify is not legitimate. Ridiculous reasoning happening here.\n\nYou're the AH for not just getting back up after she told you. You don't need to have something on a seat to save it. Both (item or talking) are total honor system things and just because she didn't have something on the seat doesn't mean you're not rude. You can sit there, but you're an asshole.", "YTA, it\u2019s crazy to me the hills people choose to die on. Instead of being like \u201coh sorry didn\u2019t know\u201d and getting back up, you\u2019re willing to, at best, sit for a while in an airport next to people who actively loathe you.", "In Dutch we have saying: \"opgestaan is plaats vergaan\", which literally translates to \"stood up, place is gone\". I think it would be something typically applied to situations like this. Nobody paid for a specific seat, so you can't claim it's yours. You can try to, but when a seat is free anyone is free to sit there. The person claiming the seat has no rights, especially when there was no clear indication.", "YTA. Despite all these \"law of the jungle\" responses, basic politeness is simple. She's saving a seat for someone in the washroom, you get up and look elsewhere. I've stood around/crouched/sat on the floor at airport gates many times; it's no big deal. They were there first.", "YTA. It is perfectly acceptable to save a seat for someone who is only going to the bathroom or getting refreshments.

There's no hard and fast universal rule about seat-saving in crowded public places -- at least, not when all parties are able-bodied, as seems to be the case here -- so neither OP nor the other people were wrong to feel in the right. \n\nThat said... I personally always leave stuff on or near my seat when I'm asking someone else to save a seat in a crowded airport for me, because providing a visual indication that the seat is occupied makes it easier for them to save the seat. And I personally would have gotten up if I had been in OP's place, because insisting that a seat is yours (when you could safely stand or sit on the floor or find a different seat) is never worth the risk of pissing off someone you might be stuck on a plane with, in close quarters for potentially hours.

Family's old or not. \n\nAlso to note. There is no assigned seating at airports and you are not entitled to keep a seat you aren't currently using.
