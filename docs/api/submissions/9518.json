It depends on the field and what you want to do. Tons of people start companies, learn trades, go into farming....whatever. Unless it is a STEM field or medical field or some others college isn't something you do just to do it. As an adult, if you want to go to college it is 100% reasonable to expect you to pay for your adult schooling. \n\nListen, struggling and learning to strive and to have a work ethic and drive and be self reliant  and to understand the value of money and appreciating things you get by having to pay for them yourself.

I have similar back ground but it\u2019s was cuz he was alcoholic and didn\u2019t make any money.", "\u2018Sedai\u2019 is a fandom reference that I\u2019ll let you Google (it\u2019s SFW) - this made me smile.  :)", "That needs to be wider known", "Wish I'd known this.  This should be required knowledge for everyone in HS.  Maybe it is now, I graduated in 2002.\n\nMy parents were cheap and selfish af, and I still remember when it came back that I couldn't get financial aid, the reason was that \"we had a really good year\" because of my dad retiring.\n\nAnyways, I really appreciate you being in this thread and spreading this information.", "I wish this was more well known, knew people in this situation all too much.", "It\u2019s not, it works for the vast majority of people and there are things in place to deal with the edge cases. It\u2019s a massive system that works for millions of people every year.", "THIS. \n\nShe was there to find out what type of man she was with. That conversation was no accident. She's probably thanking you in her head.", " \n\nI was able to get the FAFSA and go back to school as an independent poor person", "Sorry, no, she kept herself from years of misery. She just did what everyone AITA would have told her to do. \n\nAnd I'm also glad she didn't fall into the tired trope of I cAn ChAnGe HiM (No, you can't).", "That is so cool! I obviously had no idea, but it is so fitting :)\n\n\"They aided mankind as scientists, healers and philosophers.\" - see, there you are.", "Pretty sure the whole reason they were there to begin with was because of her suspicions.  I'm going to guess he had no plans on going to his grandchild's b-day until she started questioning why.\n\nLooks like his \"I'll prove it to ya\" part of the plan backfired.", ">Most schools make it so difficult with no 2 workers giving the same answer.\n\nUnfortunately if it wasn't so difficult, we'd see a lot of rich students whose parents are supporting them do it as well, which would take up a lot of the available financial aid funds. The best solution to me would seem to make college more affordable overall, but what do I know.", "It is supposed to be this difficult. If not, every well off kid would just claim no support from their parents and suddenly be eligible for government support they shouldn\u2019t need.", "It is beyond selfish to get married when you have college aged children. I don't know why people do this.", "I\u2019m sorry that happened. When my oldest started college his father and I had different ideas as to helping with college. We were separated when he started his second year so thankfully he was able to just put my salary and the difference in debt for the two years is insane.\n\nEdit to add that when we were married we were still paycheck to paycheck but I was hoping we could make some adjustments to help for college.", "They expected my single mom to have over $10k a year to contribute on a teacher's salary. She was taking care of my sick grandmother and sending my younger sister to Catholic school at the time. I was lucky to get $100 for textbooks, and had to ask my aunts for dorm supplies for my 18th birthday that summer. I needed to take out high-interest loans to cover the gap, which I am still saddled with over a decade later. Its a horrible system", "Yep. I live in farm country and this was a problem. The parents would own a farm with all the expensive equipment, livestock, and property that entails. But their actual income and cash flow is barely middle class. So on paper, and according to FAFSA, they're absolutely loaded and don't need assistance of any kind even if that was complete BS.", "How do you get documentation of parental refusal to support?  What counts?", "In fairness to my mom, she had no way of knowing how it would affect me. I am the youngest but none of my siblings went to college so FAFSA was foreign to us both. I give her shit about it in a lighthearted way now, but sometimes you don't know what you don't know.", "I am fairly certain the FAFSA was designed to intentionally overestimate parents\u2019 disposable income to force students into either high-interest private loans or to not seek higher education at all. Either option benefits the already-wealthy and their children. Most economic policy in the United States, which has near-unanimous bipartisan consensus, is designed around wealth extraction from the bottom to the top through privatization.", "NTA she asked, you answered. If he doesn't like the truth being told, maybe he shouldn't have made it be the truth.", "NTA - Ask your father, \"Did I lie?\"", "Typical narc reaction. It's always someone else's fault when they suffer consequences due to their own selfish behavior.\n\nNTA", "You do sound entitled, as an adult you choose the journey and path you go down. You are financially responsible for that no one else is.", "NTA", "NTA, you told the truth, he doesn't disagree so should be able to defend his decisions, and if his partner doesn't agree with how he chooses to behaviour he should realise they're not meant to be together", "NTA.", "Nta you got back at your shitty dad by accident", "\"If the truth about his conduct paints him in a bad light, the problem isn't with the truth, it's with his conduct.\" NTA", "NTA, you just told the fricking truth, dude deserves what he got if you ask me...", "NTA, be the person you want to be remembered as. Also, she has already had these thoughts and was already figuring it out. You didn\u2019t cause a breakup, you confirmed to her what she was already noticing. Think of it this way, you saved her time, energy, and heartbreak.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your dad sucks.", "NTA. She asked, and you were being honest with her. It doesn't sound like you were trying to influence her in any way, and ultimately, the decision to leave was hers. The fact that she had already noticed the same things makes me think she was probably already mulling over the decision whether to leave or not.", "NTA thank you for being a decent human being and saving your dad's ex-GF from wasting her time in a relationship with someone selfish and cold.  She deserved the truth - and you served it.  That's some good karma.  Dad can go F himself.", "Sharing relevant information with someone's partner should never be considered an asshole move, they deserve to know who they're dating.", "NTA.\n\nYou have every right to speak your truth.\n\nIf his outlook on life, money, kids, relationships is undesirable, then it\u2019s u desirable.

NTA.", "i dream of doing this lol", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not even about who\u2019s right or wrong in how he chose to (not) parent you, or what *your* assessment of the situation is. The only problem is that he thinks he did nothing wrong, and *his ex* disagrees. \n\nAnd if he thinks he did nothing wrong, there\u2019s no reason why he should fault you for saying the truth.", "She asked. You told. End of story. NTA", "NTA.  Your dad found out that the truth does indeed hurt.", "NTA. All you said was the truth.

NTA", "nTA not even a little", "NTA you told the truth and sometimes the truth hurts", "NTA, she asked and you answered truthfully.  It's not like you reached out to her to bad mouth him.  It is her right to find out what kind of person she is in a relationship with.", "NTA. Your dad abdicated his responsibility to you. So enraging. To expect any filial loyalty - particularly when you were honest about *his own* role in your life - after that is absurd. If he doesn't want to be judged for abandonment, he could have not abandoned you.", "NTA.   She asked a question and you answered it.  If you grew up with a dad who was kind and involved in raising you, that on its own would have made things different. If you remembered him reading you stories, playing games and taking you on outings, you wouldn\u2019t be so angry.  But he didn\u2019t spend time or money, even though he had plenty.  That\u2019s just mean spirited.  You told the truth, and doesn\u2019t want to hear it. NTA", "Not even close to being the asshole.", "NTA \n\nShe asked and you told her.", "NTA. - This is a case of the whole circumstance going right over your father's head and instead of introspecting on the matter, he's opted to blame you for personal issues triggered by his own faults.", "Meh, his butts puckered up because the truth hurts...", "NTA. Also if you were an adult he should have not tried to claim you as a dependent. He is an AH", "NTA, I applaud you for not playing the game or letting him put on a show..  True colors always show up in time", "NTA I'm proud of you, and her! It's not your fault, you just told the truth and turns out she's a really good person. And too good for him.", "NTA. You only answered what you were being asked. And you probably did save her a lot of time.", "NTA. She asked; you answered. And if he was a great bf otherwise, I doubt she would have broken up with him. She was already piecing together the kind of person your father is. You just saved her some time. Besides, it still took her 3 days to decide to break up with him. So what you said Didnt make her immediately break up with him. She still had to reflect on it all first.", "NTA - you told the truth.", "NTA. She asked and it's not your job to lie for him.", "NTA. \"I *was* capable of doing it on my own, Dad.

He lost a good woman because of his failure as a father.", "NTA \n\nShe asked a question and you told her the truth. Just shows that he knew what he did was messed up. Or he would have been ok with her knowing about it. He ruined his relationship with you and your sister. Now his girlfriend. He shouldn\u2019t be blaming you for a question she asked you. Makes me wonder if she has asked him and what he told her.", "NTA and his ex is going to be forever grateful to you for telling her the truth before they got more involved. I\u2019m going to guess that if she\u2019s ever tried to bring up these traits she was starting to see, he would\u2019ve just gaslighted her. I do wonder if dad ever told her some bullshit story about why you\u2019re NC with him\u2026", "NTA  he\u2019s mad at being exposed.", "NTA. She was seeing it for herself already and likely brought it up as it was a concern for her. \n\nGood on her for having the smarts to GTFO now, and you have zero responsibility to hold on to.", "NTA. It was the truthful answer to a question she asked.  Your dad has no one to blame but himself, especially since he is still up to the same shit.", "I think you just gave her a nudge in the right direction. She asked you answered. NTA", "NTA! She asked and you spoke the truth freely", "NTA. She asked and you told the truth. Lying would\u2019ve kept her in a potentially bad relationship longer so you saved her that.

You didn't air random \"grievances,\" you shared The Truth.  Telling the truth doesn't make you an A, it makes you honest.

It's on him, not you.", "Your dad learned\u2026 FAFO.\n\nNote\u2026 he never said you lied.", "NTA. I was going to say the opposite. But he had the means and he is a cheapskate. She asked. It's his fault, not yours. Also the government's fault. Everyone should be eligible for FAFSA. It's stupid. Kids can't control their parents spending habits and it is so unfair to children.", "NTA gf asked you answered and didn\u2019t lie so let it go", "NTA, you did the right thing and she\u2019s smart for seeing the writing on the wall.", "NTA she asked a serious question and you gave an honest answer. One of my favorite quotes goes like \"if they wanted you to speak kindly of them, they should have treated you better.\" Lying to her wouldn't have done her any favors either and it seems like that's exactly what he wanted. For you to lie and make him look good. But since she was already starting to see him for who he is it wouldn't have mattered if you did lie. All you did was tell the truth and spare that woman a huge headache of a man. You did nothing wrong. Narcissists have a way of making good people feel like they did wrong by just not enabling them.", "Aren\u2019t the mods supposed to be cutting down on this", "NTA  \n\n\nYou saved that lass from a terrible mistake.", "NTA. OP's sperm-donor is just pissed that his true personality was revealed to his current GF sooner rather than later. That man is not a dad.", "Nope NTA. She asked, tour answered honestly. Why would you want tot lie for a jerk like that?", "NTA. Jesus Christ you just told your story. Other peoples reactions don\u2019t belong to you.", "NTA, but you may have accidentally helped your dad dodge a bullet. If she was a gold digger, and saw that he wasn\u2019t willing to spend money on his children, this might be reason enough for her not to spend any more time with him.", "NTA. And good on his GF for bailing on this bum.", "NTA. You didn't air your grievances, you answered her question. If he wanted to look better in your story he should have behaved better.", "YTA and extremely entitled.\nYour dad worked to support a family and your mom\u2019s \u201cjob\u201d was raising you. You also somehow seem to think he owed you a college education.

She already had half a foot out the door before talking to you, and she likely used her question as a way to confirm some suspicions regarding his character she had.", "NTA if he needs you to hide the truth to make his relationship work, then he doesn't deserve the relationship.", "NTA honestly. She asked a question. You answered. You didn\u2019t tell her to break up with him.

Thats deep.", ">If he wanted you to tell a different story, he should have lived a different life.\n\nOoooooofff.
