YTA if that's the case. Take out loans like the majority of people and stop acting like you are entitled to a free ride.", "NTA.  Rule #1. Don't bring your dates around people who may tell them the truth, if you don't want it known.  She asked, you told, and dad sucks.  End of story.", "LMFAO NTA. \"You're an adult, so I owe you nothing. But you also have no right to free speech, because I don't like it.\" Your father is awful. I'm glad his girlfriend left him.", "NTA  \n\n\nAsked, and answered!   \n\n\n(Also, my mom did that to me with the loans thing - and it was ridiculous)", "NTA. She asked, you answered. If he wants people to say nicer things about him, he should be a better person.", "NTA \n\nshe asked because she already had a doubt and wanted to be sure. She probably asked your father before and wasn\u2019t convinced by his answer. She followed you to smoke the very first time she met you and didn\u2019t do small talk but ask a real important question instead. She already had a huge doubt about her relationship with your dad and wanted to find the reason for the break up", "NTA. She asked. What are you going to do, lie for a man that you meant nothing to?", "NTA. You are entitled to share your story with whom ever you please. She asked , you told her your truth about your father. \nA hit dog hollers , that\u2019s why he is overreacting. It\u2019s just more confirmation he is a shitty parent . If he was a supportive and loving one he would be apologizing for the mistakes and asking about how to repair.", "NTA!", "Nope not the AH she asked you told and she made a decision. Your father can be upset but its not your problem. Maybe he should have been a better dad.", "Nta. Also are you my sibling because we might have the same dad?", "NTA you saved her from a difficult future. I'm sure she's very thankful.", "NTA you only told the truth. He should be ashamed of himself.", "NTA", "NTA. He decided to show up to meet his grandkids to impress his new girlfriend, which means he knows he was in the wrong his whole life.", "Nta you told her the truth when she ask", "NTA. Apparently gf doesn\u2019t think 18 year olds should be thrown to the world with no support, not your fault", "NTA. Tell him to go play a few rounds of golf to cool off.", "NTA - she asked because it seemed abnormal to her. She noticed similar traits and decided that your Dad wasn't for her. She already had doubts. If she was that into him, she would have ignored what you were saying. Your Dad has no one to blame but himself.", "I thought it was much worse but yeah you are right. Fuk him", "ESH - and you don\u2019t know how FAFSA and dependency works, so stop taking that out on other people. You are the one who determines whether or not you are a dependent after 18. Not your dad or anyone else.", " NTA -HIGH FIVES-", "NTA.\n\nNot the asshole for just telling the truth to a question posed to you. \n\nI don't really agree with your reasons for not seeing him. I was prepared to hear some really bad stuff, some way he really betrayed you or hurt you and abused you. \n\nHe was gone a lot? He has it to where you had to work your way through college instead of him helping? Those are first world problems my man.\n\nFirst, not everyone needs to go to college. It depends on the field and what you want to do. Tons of people start companies, learn trades, go into farming....whatever. Unless it is a STEM field or medical field or some others college isn't something you do just to do it. As an adult, if you want to go to college it is 100% reasonable to expect you to pay for your adult schooling. \n\nListen, struggling and learning to strive and to have a work ethic and drive and be self reliant  and to understand the value of money and appreciating things you get by having to pay for them yourself. That is a gift. Struggle is good. People that are pampered and entitled and who think they are owed everything and who don't appreciate things they got easily or that someone else paid for.....you are much better off then they are. \n\nUnless you left out some wrongs, your reasoning for cutting him off seem petty.", "I like that expression: \"if you wanted me to tell a different story, he should have lived a different life.\" Going to steal that for my own usage in appropriate situations.", "> If he wanted you to tell a different story, he should have lived a different life.\n\nI feel like you should add your name here. You will be quoted. I shall call you Master Sedai.\n\nOP, NTA, what Master Sedai said, plus you didn't cause the breakup, the girlfriend did that when she had more information and made a more informed, very wise choice.", "I have to assume that OP\u2019s dad & girlfriend showed up to the birthday party because the girlfriend had started asking questions like \u201cwhy do you never see your children or grandchildren?\u201d So they came & Dad hoped against hope that his kids would portray a happy, loving family so that his girlfriend would be impressed. Then OP went & \u201cruined\u201d everything by answering a question honestly.", "She asked, OP. You were honest. You shouldn't lie to her just to make your dad look better. She would have found this out about him eventually but it sounds like she had already seen the writing on the wall. He can't have this both ways. He is getting what he put into this, which is virtually nothing. \n\nYou're NTA and you would have been if you had lied to her. If he wants you to have a different opinion, he has to earn that.", "Perfect comment. OP NTA", "Well, that sums that up! \n\nWhat they said ^^^ \n\nNTA", "Like this. \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA big time.  OP still has debt, Dad is still not stepping up, shoe fits.  This was GF's decision, who let you know she was already seeing the signs.  The fact that GF implicated OP in the breakup was cheap, and not on OP.  Tell dad to own his choices, that is, grow up.", "Last I checked you are independent on the FAFSA if you get married. \n\nGood luck either way and congratulations on having a plan.", "Wouldn't be surprised if the dad was using this event as an excuse to pretend they're in good standing with their family after the girlfriend had been suspicious. When it didn't go as he had planned, he took it out on his son instead of owning up to their own past mistakes.", "I mean his dad is thr reason he loses out on opportunities, seems fair to blame him.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like dad objected to any of the facts in the story. He just wanted to hide them from his girlfriend because he knew she had different values. \n\nIf she thought the way you and OP\u2019s dad do, she wouldn\u2019t have left. I\u2019d think someone like you would be *happy* that a relationship between two clearly incompatible people has ended. After all, if they don\u2019t agree on financial or emotional obligations, they\u2019re going to have a hard time building a life together, won\u2019t they? And since no one is entitled to anything from anyone else, he certainly wasn\u2019t *entitled* to a relationship with her - she was free to walk away for any reason she pleased. Right?", "lol if you need to constantly avoid and escape your family for your \"mental health\" maybe you shouldn't have started one.\n\nNTA", "y\u2019all are weird. ok he doesn\u2019t have to offer support but he could have offered everything the son needed so he could go to college on time not at 25", "Dad is over 18, OP doesn't owe him anything.", "This warmed my heart ! I\u2019m so glad you are willing to take ownership and possible learn to something different. We can learn to be better parents", "Don't feel bad, you saved that woman some time. How is the quote? If it can be destroyed by the truth it should be destroyed? Besides, she was already doubting him - no wonder. If one of your children cut you, maybe it's a child's issue. If both cut you, well... chances are you are the issue.", "NTA. The fact is, she noticed bad behavior. She suspected this before even meeting you all. She\u2019s also probably behind him actually going to the party, she wanted to gather intel. So you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, you just sped up the timetable. Also, you didn\u2019t go around blasting your father. It\u2019s only after she asked that you answered honestly.", "Not NTA, keep doing that for all his future girlfriends", "I mean, she asked you. And she asked to confirm things that already were in her head. So yeah, you did nothing wrong here", "NTA you kept his gf from having years of problems.", "That\u2019s correct. She knew something was up with this guy already and was likely looking for a reason to split. OP did her a favor. NTA.", "Depends on the school and workers. I knew someone who had to go to court to be \"emancipated\" at 18,  3 letters from non family, and a review that took over 3 months. Then she got her accommodation. Most schools make it so difficult with no 2 workers giving the same answer. I know this isn't how it is \"suppose\" to be, but is reality.", "I was told that I would need a letter from my parents saying they wouldn't support me. They refused to support me, but having other people know would look bad, so they wouldn't fill it out.", "Exactly. I even know people who went to court to be emancipated at 18 and has much better opinions for university.", "I spent my entire childhood in a single parent household and my mom remarried when I was 16, effectively doubling my \"expected family contribution\" even though her husband provided fuck all for me and my siblings (and we didn't expect him to). I can't imagine the amount of grants and other aid I missed out on because of that. FAFSA is a joke.", "Not only do they assume you have access to your parents\u2019 income but they assume you have access to basically all of their income in cash at any given time and nobody in your family has a penny of living expenses. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s improved any since I was in college but it used to be so common to have poor families living very modestly but still only making it paycheck-to-paycheck, only for FAFSA to think they have $25k/yr to drop on their child\u2019s college on a $40k/yr gross household income.", "It also does not actually make sense for people who barely earn enough to get by. They still wouldn\u2019t qualify for a Pell grant and extra aid bc for some reason they don\u2019t account for the fact that the economy has been trash since 2008 and someone making $70k actually lives in near poverty.", "I love this comment. Indeed, OP was kind enough to tell this woman the truth so she doesn't have to waste her time on someone who's going to disappoint her. Now she's free to find what she really wants.", "Exactly!\n\nSometimes family issues are complicated but this one sure wasn't.\n\nThere were no two sides to this - just a father unwilling to help his kids with anything after they turned 18. Not housing, not college, not anything else.", "Yeah unfortunately that can be the case.  Dept of Ed passed new regulations effective last year that specifically prohibit this action.  Also, beginning July 1 this year anyone who has been determined independent through a PJ won't have to resubmit every year.  If schools are giving someone the runaround file a complaint with ED. They take these claims very seriously.", "Yup. Couldn\u2019t have contact with both parents due to abuse. Got away tried to go to college, explained everything to admin and they wanted me to speak to my parents and get it in writing."]}
