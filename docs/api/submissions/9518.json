You answered a question truthfully, you did not offer that information on your own or out of malice or spite. If he didn't want the truth to be told, he should've done a better job of creating another truth. Doubling down on his AH behaviour shows exactly why she dumped him, you merely accelerated the outcome, but since she \"already noticed\" these traits in him, I am fairly certain it was not a question of if but when she would leave him. He is the entitled one by expecting everyone not to tell the truth about his obviously selfish and narcissistic behaviour.

Seems like your father just showed up to the birthday to fake being a good parent, and The girlfriend caught on.\n\nThe girlfriend asked about your relationship with your dad because she noticed that he might not be a good father to his current kids, and wanted the truth.\n\nYou didn\u2019t tell her to dump your father, and It was her choice. If your father wasn\u2019t willing to help his own son through college or come to visit his grandkids, It is clear that he won\u2019t be a good father to their kids if she were to have one with him in the future.

And yeah FASFA is definitely an ahole here, but op's dad was absent during childhood.  We can certainly say \"kids aren't entitled to their parent's money\" but if you can help your kid through college why wouldn't you?  Op's dad had then means, he just felt he shouldn't have to.  Frankly I find the whole idea that 18 year Olds are expected by some to immediately support themselves, particularly in this economy, it be kinda cruel", "You're a kid, aren't you?\n\nYeah I'm assuming the dad wants to retire at some point. paying for 2 kids university could mean another 5-10 years of work.  Expecting him to pay just cause he can is entitled and so cringe.  Maybe he has his own life and dreams. Maybe there's things that he always wanted to do but couldn't because he had to work to feed his family.\n\nIt's his money.
