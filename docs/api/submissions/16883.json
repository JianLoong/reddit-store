He insisted I make eggs because he doesn\u2019t know how, I told him I would show him because this past week he said he wanted to learn how to cook and he got very upset because \u201che doesn\u2019t feel like learning how to cook right now\u201d. I eventually agreed to make breakfast because I\u2019m hungry too. When we got to the kitchen I asked him if he could clean the litter box and he immediately said no. Mind you, these are my cats I had before we met so they are my responsibility, but we have lived together for the past 2 years and I have never asked him to clean the litter box. He also is constantly saying the cats are his pets too now because he loves them so much. When I asked him he said \u201che didn\u2019t know how\u201d, even though he shared a cat with his previous gf and has told me about cleaning that litter box before. I\u2019ve noticed he tends to do this when I ask him to help with chores around the house (dishes, laundry, tidying up). We have had multiple arguments about him not pitching in on shared chores, especially since he isn\u2019t working and is home all day everyday. I got really frustrated and told him I\u2019m not going to make breakfast anymore and went into the bedroom. Now i\u2019m wondering AITA for asking him to clean the litter since they were my pets before we met?\n\nupdate: before i left for work today i told him how i was feeling extremely disrespected and undervalued in this relationship, and felt that way for a long time. i told him i\u2019m not his maid or his mother i\u2019m his girlfriend. i laid out tasks i expect to be done by the time i get home, i will update tonight with what happened.", "created_utc": 1683723267, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dpt0a/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_clean_the_litter/", "score": 221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who you\u2019re with should be your teammate, not your child. This dude is a child and you need to break up with him. Fuck your family\u2019s expectations and the pressure from them. You do not want to live like this for the rest of your life, do you?", "Hahaha, yes, sorry, that was an insult to toddlers", "he is one of my best friends and has helped me work through a lot of things that i\u2019ve struggled with in the past. also my family loves him a lot (they don\u2019t know about these issues) and are constantly talking about us getting married and stuff so idk it seems like what i\u2019m supposed to be doing. i keep hoping that one day one of these conversations/fights will stick out to him and he will start pitching in but i\u2019m starting to think that won\u2019t happen", "yup, this one. OP, there are problems couples work through,  but this isn\u2019t one of them. He is helpless, useless, contributes nothing, yet leaves you feeling like you might be a jerk. Not worth it.", "\ud83d\ude02 When can I get him vacuuming, I wonder?!", "Familial and societal expectations are not a reason to saddle yourself with someone who will not lift a finger to help you, imagine how much worse this would get if you have kids! \n\nIf you do truly want to make it work with him, I would highly recommend going to couples therapy. He needs to address the root cause of why he behaves this way before he can change, if he\u2019s willing to.", "He won't change because he doesn't have a reason to change. If you want to continue being his housekeeper and mother for the rest of your relationship (however long it lasts), that's your choice. If you want an equal partner who will clean a litter box and scramble his own eggs once in a while, it's time to look elsewhere. You're 24, far too young to settle for a deadbeat boyfriend.", "After 2 years?? Nah.\n\nHe seems to fit perfectly as a friend only living by himself. Act accordingly.", "He'll never pitch in, he doesn't care enough. Also, your family deciding that he's your future doesn't mean that's the way it has to be. What you're actually'supposed to be doing' is sorting out a good life for yourself. Will you have that with him?", "Leave him. It will not get better. If you stay, than YTA to yourself", "Sorry girl, but that is not gonna happen. Right now, the situation is perfect for him. He doesn't have to do anything, gets his meals cooked for him, his laundry done, doesn't have to help with the cats. \nJust because he helped you through some stuff, doesn't mean that you have to stay with him for the rest of your life. You are not indebted to him. \nIf your family loves him so much, they can take him in and marry him or adopt him. You don't have to suffer for that.", "Woahhhh. NEVER stay with somebody because it feels like what you\u2019re \u201csupposed to do.\u201d I had an ex very similar to yours. He never, ever changed. One day my brother started telling me that it was about time that I marry my bf and he started trying to convince me that it\u2019s just the next natural progression at that point. (My family did not know how he was really like)\n\nAnyway, that was what I needed to hear because I immediately in my head went \u201cno way! I can\u2019t live like this for the rest of my life!\u201d And was genuinely so stressed at the thought of marrying him and being in that relationship for years and years and years more. I broke up with him a month later and let me tell you.. I saved SOO much time, energy, and money only having to take care of myself afterwards. And my stress levels lowered completely.\n\nI know you said he\u2019s one of your best friends, but is this the life you want? Or do you want to be with an actual partner?", "Supposed to be doing? No one lives your life except you. It\u2019s pretty clear you can\u2019t change him.  It\u2019s time to make an exit plan or accept you will bear the burden of these things. Personally I wouldn\u2019t want that. But if you love him enough to overlook it\u2026", "Lol.", "In my first relationship my ex called time due to falling out of love, despite having the same sort of feelings of friendship, shared history and support and familial encouragement. Trouble was, she called it a year too late and by that point, due to built up resentment, the break up ended up being toxic enough for both of us to decide to go NC. Wasn't easy for either of us, but we're both better off 5 years down the line. If we split when it was time, we might still be friends. Now we're just aware of each other on Facebook.", "Holy crap, that is the biggest case of \"I'm too stupid to function\" I've ever seen. Like someone said below, weaponized incompetence, 1000%. \n\nNTA. Shared home = shared chores. \"I don't know how\" isn't an excuse, you're a grown person, figure it out. You have the internet.", "NTA. RUN", "NTA,if he's like this now,imagine what he would be like if you had children.\nYou deserve better.", "NTA \n\nHe's 25, not 5, you asked him to clean the litter 6 perform brain surgery,  he 100% can figure it out.", "Nta. He's never going to do anything if he can guilt, nag, or berate someone else into doing it.  Throw him out with the used kitty litter.", "Wait, he doesn't work and you are making breakfast??\nWtf???\nGirl, run. NTA", "DTMFA.  \n\nNTA but you will be if you stay with this \u2018man\u2019.  \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, even if he starts doing the tasks you ask.  Now you\u2019re not his maid, but you\u2019ve become his manager.   Which is still no way to have a partnership.", " Weaponised incompetence at its finest. Stand your ground until he understands it\u2019s not acceptable.", "NTA but you will be if you stay with\u2026this", "NTA - keep the cat, find a new dude.", "Why exactly do you stay together with such a loser?", "NTA.\n\nPerhaps he needs to spend some time alone to figure out how to do things.", "NTA.  After reading your post and a few of your follow up comments, I would leave him if he does not agree to help you.  How does he not know how to cook eggs at 25?  My 10 year old can make some damn good scrambled eggs so he has no excuse.  He doesn\u2019t feel like learning how to cook \u201cright now\u201d because he expects you to always cook for him.  It\u2019s not about the litter box when he does this with every single thing you ask of him.", "NTA. What are you getting out of this relationship?  You pay for things. You clean. You would do better on your own. I\u2019m sorry a best friend doesn\u2019t treat you like this. My best friend shows up at my house with pizza and coke (soda). If I have laundry to fold she folds it with me. When I show up at her house if she is cleaning I help her. That\u2019s what best friends do. No just sit there and say I don\u2019t know how.", "OP, and any other ladies reading, I've seen too many of these stories... if he doesn't know how to cook, that alone should be an indicator that he's not a good partner. Don't date anyone who lacks life skills, NTA", "NTA he needs to do his part and help out!", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t know how to clean a litter box??? I mean\u2026 come on. A 5 year old can figure out how to scoop some poop out of a box \ud83d\ude44 I\u2019d get the hell out of that relationship asap. He\u2019s trying to manipulate you into doing everything for you but the more alarming part is that he\u2019s either an absolute idiot or he believes you are. Or both. But he can\u2019t come up with a better reason to not clean the box than \u2018I don\u2019t know how\u2019???", "NTA\n\nIf you guys actually split other duties evenly then I would understand that the cat duties should be your responsibility because they are your cats.  But that's not the case here and he's just making excuses.", "NTA Oh hell no he\u2019s lazy and he\u2019s not working .. girl it\u2019s time to let that  loser go .. saying I don\u2019t know how every damn time he doesn\u2019t wanna do something is freaking pathetic..You deserve better and I know damn well u know it.", "NTA but when he starts saying he doesn\u2019t know how say something like \u201cI believe in you babe. You\u2019re a smart guy. You will work it out. Google it if you need to.\u201d Stop accepting excuses cause you know they are bullshit anyway.", "NTA. \n\nYour BF is a lazy lout. He\u2019ll  spends time arguing with you about not doing chores so that you\u2019ll get frustrated enough to do them instead. He avoids responsibility. It\u2019s an bad dynamic.", "NTA, \n\nIm looking forward to the update, though i would warn you that if he does clean up today, it can be a one time thing. He needs to prove he changed, not that he can only clean when it negatively effects him.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGuy sounds like a massive loser and a mooch, if you want to be his caretaker then stick around but he doesn't have a job and doesn't do chores, why did you even move in with him?", "You misspelled \u201c ex bf\u201d\n\nThis dude is playing dumb so you serve him. Unfortunately there is no cure since it worked for him before.\nYou really think that mentally non challenged adult can\u2019t figure out litter box scooping?? Nah..\n\nYou are NTA but he needs to be kicked", "I knew someone like this. Had a running commentary how he could do everything and anything. And probably better then all of us, yet proceded to do nothing, to the point his wife divorced him. After that it was everyone's fault but his.   \nAnd this person was a leech plain and simple, on his wife, their social circle and society after that. Now they've been divorced for years, and he still takes up oxygen... Such a waste...   \n\n\nNTA... Your bf sounds like this guy...   \nHome all day, and all he has to do is a few chores and maybe make his own food, occasionally change the litterbox, sweetheart, you're being taken advantage of... Run for the hills before you drown in the sea of red flags.", "You are NTA but you are doing this to yourself.    \nYou offered to show him how to cook, and he throws a temper tantrum because he doesn't want to learn right now. \n\nAlso, I read in one of your comments that he helped you through a tough time and that's great, but that doesn't earn him a lifelong skate through the relationship. You can be grateful, without keeping yourself unhappy.\n\nIt's awesome your family likes him, but they don't have to live with him.  They are probably talking marriage because they don't know the issues and if he's treating you differently in front of them and reverting to Mr. incompetent at home, something is rotten in the state of Denmark. \n\nThe only way he's going to learn the lesson, if ever, is if you show him the door.  He can live on his own for a bit.  I'm not saying break up, just say the living arrangements aren't going to work out if he doesn't start pulling his weight. If you don't ask him to live on his own, you're perpetuating your own frustration.", "Run away it won\u2019t get better. NTA. He knows what he is doing. If he needs to learn how to do something he can Google it. Why the hell is he not employed? Is he just mooching off you and also expecting you to do all the chores?", "Dump his dumb ass. Not worth caring for a grown man. My boyfriend always helps around the house and with cooking. Your boyfriend is just lazy and its embarrassing", "I used to do this. When I was 5 and I didn't want to clean my room, baby boy will grow out if it eventually", "NTA. He knows what he\u2019s doing. It\u2019s weaponized incompetence. There\u2019s literally no way he\u2019s 25 and can\u2019t make breakfast. He knows how to clean a litter box he just doesn\u2019t want to. Even on the off chance he doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s YouTube and you offered to teach him. He just don\u2019t want to do it", "NTA. Dump your boyfriend, you and your cats deserve better.", "Will be interested to see the update", "NTA clear cut case of weaponized incompetence. Also if he isn\u2019t working and you are 100% of the household tasks should be on him until he starts working again. He won\u2019t change though so be prepared that the relationship may end.", "This x100. He is refusing to help in any way so that you\u2019ll just do everything for him. This is a make or break convo to have with him. You aren\u2019t his servant, you are his partner and he isn\u2019t contributing to your shared home. \n\nNTA, keep us updated!", "My nephew is 14 and cooks eggs, takes care of the dogs, and does his personal laundry.", "Id agree with this, except it puts all the responsibility on the woman, yet again. What about Daddy teaching him some basic responsibility and life skills?", "It's not helping. It's taking care of his damn self.", "I mean I'd argue just straight incompetence since Google has existed for about what 20 years or more and he doesn't know how to Google \"how to make eggs\"", "Well. Weaponized incompetence also covers \"insists they can't do it bc they don't know how (and then refuses to learn)\" as well as \"insists they can't do it bc someone else does it better (but doesn't do anything else as a tradeoff)\". It's entirely about presenting themselves as helpless or useless at things so that others will do stuff for them, which includes a few different methods of doing so, not just \"fucked up task so badly they get banned from it\".", "Its worse than that, he doesn't work! Wtf is he doing with his time? He is a leech.", "You ARE the Bang Maid here!  Lose this guy like yesterday.", "my god, he doesn\u2019t work AND doesn\u2019t do anything around the house. i was thinking this was one of those situations where two working partners were fighting about division of labor at home but this is so not acceptable in any way", "If you\u2019ve had the conversation before and nothing has changed then you either deal with this forever or move on. What does he even bring to the table?", "You either brake up and find someone better, or stay with him and be unhappy forever. You choose.", "If you really want to keep trying, I think an ultimatum is necessary. And an exit plan if he doesn\u2019t hold up his end.", "This may be way off base but is there a chance he has an undiagnosed condition? This honestly sounds like me at points in my life. I have an underactive thyroid and depression. If either of those aren't properly treated, I'm useless.\n\nI remember my ex begging me to do anything to help and I just couldn't. It wasn't that I didn't want to. The first day my thyroid meds kicked in I was in the backyard for hours demolishing a shed she said she didn't want anymore.\n\nSome people are naturally lazy but I like to see if there's something else at the root. Just food for thought.", "Stop doing anything for him. He wants to eat, he can cook. Ran out of clean clothes, he can do his laundry. Right now he has a live in maid that is doing everything.", "Yeah I agree.  She shouldn\u2019t even have to ask for him to pitch in.  If she wants to make this relationship work, they need to come to some sort of agreement.  Even then, I have doubts about it.  If he doesn\u2019t value her then there is always a chance he can slip back into these habits over time and they\u2019ll be right back where they are now.", "Fair, makes sense, I had a limited view of it as I'm not super experienced with it or cared to look it up before.", "At least she knows what she\u2019s signing up for, I guess. \n\nCause you\u2019re right, it won\u2019t get better, she knows that too cause I\u2019m her post she says it\u2019s not the first time, and it\u2019s about every chore.", "Were you sitting there going, \"But I don't know hoooooow to make eggs.\"???", "[removed]", "Tell your family the truth, he's not husband material, let them see that. Invite them over and don't clean up before hand, let them see how you have to live because of his lack of contribution, tell them your home is in that condition because he's home all day making the mess and does nothing to clean it up. Tell them about all the other ways he doesn't contribute. Ask them why they don't want better for you and if they don't think you deserve better then you know to stop valuing their opinion, because loving family should want the best for you.\n\nHim listening to you vent about some problems in the past does not make him a caring partner. It makes him someone who acted like your friend for a little bit but has long since stopped giving a shit about your well-being. Meanwhile, his life is great, he has a person to act as maid, cook, laundress, life administrator, sexual gratifier, and best of all pays to do it all.\n\nI don't know you but you deserve better, everyone deserves better.", "Actually, I can't say it was that bad.
