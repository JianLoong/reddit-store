He insisted I make eggs because he doesn\u2019t know how, I told him I would show him because this past week he said he wanted to learn how to cook and he got very upset because \u201che doesn\u2019t feel like learning how to cook right now\u201d. I eventually agreed to make breakfast because I\u2019m hungry too. When we got to the kitchen I asked him if he could clean the litter box and he immediately said no. Mind you, these are my cats I had before we met so they are my responsibility, but we have lived together for the past 2 years and I have never asked him to clean the litter box. He also is constantly saying the cats are his pets too now because he loves them so much. When I asked him he said \u201che didn\u2019t know how\u201d, even though he shared a cat with his previous gf and has told me about cleaning that litter box before. I\u2019ve noticed he tends to do this when I ask him to help with chores around the house (dishes, laundry, tidying up). We have had multiple arguments about him not pitching in on shared chores, especially since he isn\u2019t working and is home all day everyday. I got really frustrated and told him I\u2019m not going to make breakfast anymore and went into the bedroom. Now i\u2019m wondering AITA for asking him to clean the litter since they were my pets before we met?\n\nupdate: before i left for work today i told him how i was feeling extremely disrespected and undervalued in this relationship, and felt that way for a long time. i told him i\u2019m not his maid or his mother i\u2019m his girlfriend. i laid out tasks i expect to be done by the time i get home, i will update tonight with what happened.", "created_utc": 1683723267, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dpt0a/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_clean_the_litter/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And he\u2019s clearly unwilling to help you do ANYTHING, so it\u2019s not even just about the cats. That is NOT what a good partner does even if the cats are \u201cyour responsibility.\u201d I live with my bf and also wanted to adopt cats so yes, I am mainly the one to take care of them\u2026 but if I ask my bf to clean their box or feed them because I am doing something else he is more than happy to help. Who you\u2019re with should be your teammate, not your child. This dude is a child and you need to break up with him. Fuck your family\u2019s expectations and the pressure from them. You do not want to live like this for the rest of your life, do you?", "Hahaha, yes, sorry, that was an insult to toddlers", "he is one of my best friends and has helped me work through a lot of things that i\u2019ve struggled with in the past. also my family loves him a lot (they don\u2019t know about these issues) and are constantly talking about us getting married and stuff so idk it seems like what i\u2019m supposed to be doing. i keep hoping that one day one of these conversations/fights will stick out to him and he will start pitching in but i\u2019m starting to think that won\u2019t happen", "yup, this one. OP, there are problems couples work through,  but this isn\u2019t one of them. He is helpless, useless, contributes nothing, yet leaves you feeling like you might be a jerk. Not worth it.", "\ud83d\ude02 When can I get him vacuuming, I wonder?!", "Familial and societal expectations are not a reason to saddle yourself with someone who will not lift a finger to help you, imagine how much worse this would get if you have kids! \n\nIf you do truly want to make it work with him, I would highly recommend going to couples therapy. He needs to address the root cause of why he behaves this way before he can change, if he\u2019s willing to.", "He won't change because he doesn't have a reason to change. If you want to continue being his housekeeper and mother for the rest of your relationship (however long it lasts), that's your choice. If you want an equal partner who will clean a litter box and scramble his own eggs once in a while, it's time to look elsewhere. You're 24, far too young to settle for a deadbeat boyfriend.", "After 2 years?? Nah.\n\nHe seems to fit perfectly as a friend only living by himself. Act accordingly.", "He'll never pitch in, he doesn't care enough. Also, your family deciding that he's your future doesn't mean that's the way it has to be. What you're actually'supposed to be doing' is sorting out a good life for yourself. Will you have that with him?", "Leave him. It will not get better. If you stay, than YTA to yourself", "Sorry girl, but that is not gonna happen. Right now, the situation is perfect for him. He doesn't have to do anything, gets his meals cooked for him, his laundry done, doesn't have to help with the cats. \nJust because he helped you through some stuff, doesn't mean that you have to stay with him for the rest of your life. You are not indebted to him. \nIf your family loves him so much, they can take him in and marry him or adopt him. You don't have to suffer for that.", "Woahhhh. NEVER stay with somebody because it feels like what you\u2019re \u201csupposed to do.\u201d I had an ex very similar to yours. He never, ever changed. One day my brother started telling me that it was about time that I marry my bf and he started trying to convince me that it\u2019s just the next natural progression at that point. (My family did not know how he was really like)\n\nAnyway, that was what I needed to hear because I immediately in my head went \u201cno way! I can\u2019t live like this for the rest of my life!\u201d And was genuinely so stressed at the thought of marrying him and being in that relationship for years and years and years more. I broke up with him a month later and let me tell you.. I saved SOO much time, energy, and money only having to take care of myself afterwards. And my stress levels lowered completely.\n\nI know you said he\u2019s one of your best friends, but is this the life you want? Or do you want to be with an actual partner?", "Supposed to be doing? No one lives your life except you. It\u2019s pretty clear you can\u2019t change him.  It\u2019s time to make an exit plan or accept you will bear the burden of these things. Personally I wouldn\u2019t want that. But if you love him enough to overlook it\u2026", "Lol.", "In my first relationship my ex called time due to falling out of love, despite having the same sort of feelings of friendship, shared history and support and familial encouragement. Trouble was, she called it a year too late and by that point, due to built up resentment, the break up ended up being toxic enough for both of us to decide to go NC. Wasn't easy for either of us, but we're both better off 5 years down the line. If we split when it was time, we might still be friends. Now we're just aware of each other on Facebook."]}
