He insisted I make eggs because he doesn\u2019t know how, I told him I would show him because this past week he said he wanted to learn how to cook and he got very upset because \u201che doesn\u2019t feel like learning how to cook right now\u201d. I eventually agreed to make breakfast because I\u2019m hungry too. When we got to the kitchen I asked him if he could clean the litter box and he immediately said no. Mind you, these are my cats I had before we met so they are my responsibility, but we have lived together for the past 2 years and I have never asked him to clean the litter box. He also is constantly saying the cats are his pets too now because he loves them so much. When I asked him he said \u201che didn\u2019t know how\u201d, even though he shared a cat with his previous gf and has told me about cleaning that litter box before. I\u2019ve noticed he tends to do this when I ask him to help with chores around the house (dishes, laundry, tidying up). We have had multiple arguments about him not pitching in on shared chores, especially since he isn\u2019t working and is home all day everyday. I got really frustrated and told him I\u2019m not going to make breakfast anymore and went into the bedroom. Now i\u2019m wondering AITA for asking him to clean the litter since they were my pets before we met?\n\nupdate: before i left for work today i told him how i was feeling extremely disrespected and undervalued in this relationship, and felt that way for a long time. i told him i\u2019m not his maid or his mother i\u2019m his girlfriend. i laid out tasks i expect to be done by the time i get home, i will update tonight with what happened.\n\nupdate 2: when i got home from work everything i asked to be completed was done. he cleaned everything and organized everything. he found a beginner recipe online and made it almost entirely by himself (i helped a little). he lined up job interviews starting tomorrow every day until the end of next week. he apologized for this morning and also how he has treated me. we had a conversation and he is aware of my expectations and that if he falls short i will kick him out and we will be done. i\u2019m was glad with the changes i saw today and i felt heard in my frustration, i hope he follows suit", "created_utc": 1683723267, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dpt0a/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_clean_the_litter/", "score": 1248, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
