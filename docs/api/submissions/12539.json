Her head knew she was not at fault, but she was saying that not being able to give her husband \"the gift of children\", which is seen to most people as a wifely duty made her feel broken and not whole. \n\nFinally she consulted her doctor, only to be diagnosed with endometriosis. A simple surgery, which was scheduled for last week, was supposed to correct the problem. She was ecstatic. Only to come out of anesthesia and be told by the doctor that he is sorry but children would not be an option. \n\nAs you can imagine, she felt devasted by these news. Yesterday I went to visit her to try to lift her spirits. I told her how incredibly sorry I was. But then I also added that being infertile may not be all that bad. Raising kids isn't all sunshine and roses. There is the added stress, expenses, sleep deprivation and time commitment. I told her to look at all the unhappy couples with kids, and that at least she and her husband would enjoy some extra freedom.\n\nAfter these comments, my sister's sadness turned into anger. She started shouting at me and told me to leave her house. She had also informed our mother because she called me later to tell me that my comments were disgusting and I should feel ashamed of myself. I feel like me trying to help my sister only made the situation worse.", "created_utc": 1679068522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tv1vx/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_better_off/", "score": 788, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her head knew she was not at fault, but she was saying that not being able to give her husband \"the gift of children\", which is seen to most people as a wifely duty made her feel broken and not whole. \n\nFinally she consulted her doctor, only to be diagnosed with endometriosis. A simple surgery, which was scheduled for last week, was supposed to correct the problem. She was ecstatic. Only to come out of anesthesia and be told by the doctor that he is sorry but children would not be an option. \n\nAs you can imagine, she felt devasted by these news. Yesterday I went to visit her to try to lift her spirits. I told her how incredibly sorry I was. But then I also added that being infertile may not be all that bad. Raising kids isn't all sunshine and roses. There is the added stress, expenses, sleep deprivation and time commitment. I told her to look at all the unhappy couples with kids, and that at least she and her husband would enjoy some extra freedom.\n\nAfter these comments, my sister's sadness turned into anger. She started shouting at me and told me to leave her house. She had also informed our mother because she called me later to tell me that my comments were disgusting and I should feel ashamed of myself. I feel like me trying to help my sister only made the situation worse.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There's nothing wrong with wanting to make sure that someone has considered all aspects of marriage. Now, if a guy was discussing proposing to his girlfriend and his girlfriend gets killed before he can ask, it's *not okay* and is *really horrible* to have that same discussion with him. He doesn't want to hear about the cons of marriage and how he lucked out that his girlfriend passed away because he's avoiding all the cons of marriage.

It can be everywhere, not just the uterus but adhering to the liver, the kidneys, heck, it can even get itself inside the muscle wall and proliferate (a condition called Adenomyosis). Endometriosis is NASTY. \n\nHaving gone through infertility I empathise greatly with your sister. It HURTS. It hurts every time you see a happy family, every time you see a baby or a pregnant woman, every advert and movie, every family gathering. It hurts. You grieve for something you'll never have and it leaves you feeling broken and empty but also guilty because people like YOU make us feel like our grief is unjustified or unworthy. We're told \"oh but you havent' really LOST anything\" or \"it's not like you had a baby and they died\" which absolutely trivialises the grief. People don't seem to get it. And they make stupid remarks. \n\nInfertility is a very specific sort of grief and a very specific sort of hurt, one that those who don't experience I think really struggle to wrap their heads around. For those fortunate enough to have never once had to question their ability to concieve, to have the CHOICE to be childless or not, they never ever feel that sense of loss and have that choice forcibly taken from them. \n\nI was 17 when I was first told \"you won't be able to concieve naturally\" and at the time I had people thinking they were being helpful saying things like \"oh well you're young, you dont' want to think about babies yet anyway.\"\n\nno, but I kinda anticipated i'd have some sort of CHOICE in the matter and the ability to do so in the future thank you very much. \n\nYou need to appologise perfusely to your sister who didn't deserve you pouring salt in her wounds.

Maybe you were trying to help, maybe you meant for it to be sweet, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, but you really need to take a look at what it was you just said to someone who's mourning the loss of their ability to bring life into this world. Who already feels inadequate, heartbroken, lost, confused, etc. And now probably feels like her sister doesn't care.

The only appropriate answer to news like this is \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d", "YTA\n\nWhat an absolutely horrible thing to say to anybody - If you can\u2019t think of something nice to say,  say nothing. \n\nDo you go around telling people who are paraplegic that they are better off in a wheelchair because buying shoes is difficult?", "YTA.  You have no idea what a devastating experience this is and your words likely made it much, much worse.", "YTA Oh my god how are you this insensitive and dense??? She is grieving. She has had the possibility of biological children ripped out from under her and that was your response? She WANTS kids. Your words were hurtful.", "YTA.\n\nYour advice to her is callous and completely lacking in empathy.  It demonstrates a total lack of understanding about her grief.", "NTA. You were trying to give her encouragement, but you did it in the wrong way. I don't think you had ill intentions, but you should seriously go back and apologize to her.", "Even if you don\u2019t want kids and maybe even feel like they\u2019re a burden doesn\u2019t give you literally any right to force your opinion on someone else who had their options taken away especially when it\u2019s something most women have been raised with as something that\u2019s natural and something everyone should want.", "YTA - wow, beyond the pale: you need help, therapy is a good idea.", "YTA YTA YTA what is wrong with you??? If I were your sister we would never speak again!!", "YTA motherhood is something she wants in her heart of hearts. She isn't ready to look at the other side. She is grieving over 6 wants but can't have. You have no idea how heartbreaking that is", "YTA. it's like this: imagine you were writing a book that was taking you a **lot** of time and effort- all for it one day to get deleted or something. No chance of getting anything back. Would you like it if someone came up to you and said 'well don't worry publishing is hard anyways and being an author is stressful so it's for the better!' I hope you said no because that would just be incredibly insensitive and disrespectful on their part! Let's try to understand people's grief instead of invalidating them in the way you did. PS: apologize to your damn sister.", "My blind mother would have lost it if someone said that to her lol. Sometimes in this subreddit I find harsh replies I think we're a bit unnecessary. But this is so deserved. This is just common sense, OP. Hopefully they learn for next time someone confides in them over a painful experience or new loss.", "Oh come on. This isn't invalidating someones feeling. OP never said you are wrong for feeling this way or you shouldn't feel this way.  It came from a place of love and helpfulness.   \nThe edit is better, but you really do not have to be an asshole while telling people there are better tools available.", "Well said  \ud83d\udc4f  OP YTA massively. OP had better start apologising and grovelling.  Just delusional.", "Couldn\u2019t put it better. Hard YTA. I have heard \u201coh you can always adopt\u201d so many fucking times and it drives me nuts. Yes, I can, but that doesn\u2019t take away the fact I\u2019m grieving right now.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed people tend to do this when they don\u2019t know what to say or aren\u2019t comfortable with other people\u2019s big emotions, but it\u2019s still AH behaviour", "The thing you can do to make a grieving person feel better is to just be present. Some people don\u2019t seem to get that.", "100% I am 40- have to have a hysterectomy. Will never be able to have children. Never wanted children- but I feel a strange loss. If someone told me it was \"better\" for me that now I don't have to worry about getting pregnant I would never forgive them.", "Nothing else can top this comment, nailed  it commenter. Spot on.", "I absolutely agree with this sentiment.", "Everything in this comment \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nYTA", "Thank you!! \nThe amount of people that tried to tell me to \u201elook on the bright side\u201c after my miscarriage was astonishing and I didn\u2019t have the words to describe how inappropriate it was and why it made me mad. After all they were \u201ejust trying to help\u201c. Thank you for explaining it so well", "Ugh, my aunt A (mom's sister) told my aunt B (mom's sister in law) that at least aunt B and her sister weren't that close when her sister died. Except they were that close and it was her only sister and a sudden loss. \n\nKarma came around to aunt A though, two shitty kids, a shitty husband, and ms.", "This is a great way to explain it! I have had my feelings invalidated from when my dad died at 12, having fertility issues, my chronic pain, and so much more. It is so frustrating and makes you feel so much worse!", "I do not believe she meant well for a second. Nobody who means well is this ignorant.", "I'm infertile and, though I don't want children, I don't understand how someone can \"feel like less of a woman\" because of it. I can understand the disappointment or even anger and sadness at not getting to achieve a dream of yours, but to go that far? That feels like an insult not only to yourself but to countless other women who go through that and it perpetuates the misogynistic idea that childbirth is all women are good for. Where did this idea even come from for you personally? Forgive me if I sound a little perturbed at that but I am curious. I hope you're getting or have gotten the help you need.", "This mentality is disgusting and sucks even more when its people u care about. I was once in a car accident that totaled my parents car and left me injured. Both said it was a blessing bc they got a bunch of money from insurance, and they didn\u2019t want the car anyway. Op YTA full stop.", "They are lying and fake 100% because no adult desperate to be a parent would mind what OP thinks are the hard parts. They want the \"hard parts\", because they're part of being a parent.\n\nIt's the ineffable *arrogance* of OP that she thinks she can *tee hee giggle* teach and train, oh teach!!!!! and traaaaain!!! her dummy dummy sister to be happy!!!!! about having had part of her soul gouged out.", "Since you can\u2019t understand how hurtful your words were, best to just shut your mouth and say nothing. Your sister is grieving very hard and is in a lot of pain and you added to it. Stay away from her. YTA", "I'm not really sure disability and infertility are really comparable. OPs sister can still be a mother right. It's kinda extreme to say its the same. \n\nI'm not saying OP is right here, clearly not the right thing to say! For the record I am both disabled and infertile. Being disabled is something that affects your life every day for the rest of your life. I'd much rather be infertile than disabled, a million times over. I'm not saying OPs sister shouldn't grieve over this, I just felt a bit uncomfortable with the analogy and wanted to just write my bit.", "Agreed. As a woman, it\u2019s very insulting. I genuinely feel for women who see their worth tied to marriage and children. They infuriate me because they say insulting things like this, but I also have compassion because that state of consciousness must be hell. No longer tying one\u2019s worth to the fulfillment of desires/external validation is a liberation I wish for everybody.", "I thought of Lilo and Stitch when the alien tells Nani \u201cat least you won\u2019t have to yell at your sister any more\u201d. Right after her sister was kidnapped in a spaceship.", "She wasn\u2019t trying to teach or train the sister she was misguidedly trying to comfort her, just like the people who point out that they can still adopt, it may be true but isn\u2019t what the sister needs or wants to hear. Just because you think the negatives are worth it doesn\u2019t make it false. Also I think a lot of parents underestimate the hard parts that why your more likely to hear of parents who wanted 4 kids stopping at 2 than parents who want 2 deciding to keep going for 4. \n\nAnd yes I guess I missed all the places where women were talking about how much they looked forward to episiotomies and being sleep deprived from being woken up every 2 hrs for feedings for years and all the Drs bills.", "They decided but then realized it wasn't worth it. That's just hindsight.", "When my daughter died, an acquaintance of mine who had also lost a child reached out to me immediately and said \u201cPlease, brace yourself. People are going to say the most horrible and insensitive things to you. They don\u2019t know any better. Our society is really bad at grief\u201d\n\nIt was literally one of the most helpful things anyone said to me during those dark days.  I wasn\u2019t as blindsided, even when people did indeed say some absolutely daft bullshit to me. Imagine telling a grieving mother that her baby is \u201cin a better place\u201d???\n\nI am deeply sincerely sorry for your losses. It\u2019s unfair and it\u2019s awful, and none of us should have to endure that kind of pain and agony.", "I overheard that said to a 24 year old father of two dying of brain cancer.  I was too stunned at the time, but later I was wishing for a baseball bat to check out how that idiot would deal with some alleyway attitude.", "Someone had the absolute gall to tell me \"she's in a better place now\". I was attending the funeral of my 14-year-old niece that I loved more than anything. I got very heated and damn near yelled back that no she's not, a better place is here with her family and friends who love her."]}
