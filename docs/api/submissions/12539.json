Her head knew she was not at fault, but she was saying that not being able to give her husband \"the gift of children\", which is seen to most people as a wifely duty made her feel broken and not whole. \n\nFinally she consulted her doctor, only to be diagnosed with endometriosis. A simple surgery, which was scheduled for last week, was supposed to correct the problem. She was ecstatic. Only to come out of anesthesia and be told by the doctor that he is sorry but children would not be an option. \n\nAs you can imagine, she felt devasted by these news. Yesterday I went to visit her to try to lift her spirits. I told her how incredibly sorry I was. But then I also added that being infertile may not be all that bad. Raising kids isn't all sunshine and roses. There is the added stress, expenses, sleep deprivation and time commitment. I told her to look at all the unhappy couples with kids, and that at least she and her husband would enjoy some extra freedom.\n\nAfter these comments, my sister's sadness turned into anger. She started shouting at me and told me to leave her house. She had also informed our mother because she called me later to tell me that my comments were disgusting and I should feel ashamed of myself. I feel like me trying to help my sister only made the situation worse.", "created_utc": 1679068522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tv1vx/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_better_off/", "score": 1691, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one who dreams of being a parent thinks it's an easy job and that it's going to be easy peasy. Telling people to essentially get over their grief is not helpful or kind.

Her head knew she was not at fault, but she was saying that not being able to give her husband \"the gift of children\", which is seen to most people as a wifely duty made her feel broken and not whole. \n\nFinally she consulted her doctor, only to be diagnosed with endometriosis. A simple surgery, which was scheduled for last week, was supposed to correct the problem. She was ecstatic. Only to come out of anesthesia and be told by the doctor that he is sorry but children would not be an option. \n\nAs you can imagine, she felt devasted by these news. Yesterday I went to visit her to try to lift her spirits. I told her how incredibly sorry I was. But then I also added that being infertile may not be all that bad. Raising kids isn't all sunshine and roses. There is the added stress, expenses, sleep deprivation and time commitment. I told her to look at all the unhappy couples with kids, and that at least she and her husband would enjoy some extra freedom.\n\nAfter these comments, my sister's sadness turned into anger. She started shouting at me and told me to leave her house. She had also informed our mother because she called me later to tell me that my comments were disgusting and I should feel ashamed of myself. I feel like me trying to help my sister only made the situation worse.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's a logical discussion and it's not a bad idea to make sure someone isn't romanticizing parenthood. Make sure they understand all angles. Ok. Let's try something else. Marriage. If someone is discussing that they want to get married, it is perfectly acceptable to discuss with them the cons of getting married. It's a big step and a serious decision. There's nothing wrong with wanting to make sure that someone has considered all aspects of marriage. Now, if a guy was discussing proposing to his girlfriend and his girlfriend gets killed before he can ask, it's *not okay* and is *really horrible* to have that same discussion with him. He doesn't want to hear about the cons of marriage and how he lucked out that his girlfriend passed away because he's avoiding all the cons of marriage.

It can be everywhere, not just the uterus but adhering to the liver, the kidneys, heck, it can even get itself inside the muscle wall and proliferate (a condition called Adenomyosis). Endometriosis is NASTY. \n\nHaving gone through infertility I empathise greatly with your sister. It HURTS. It hurts every time you see a happy family, every time you see a baby or a pregnant woman, every advert and movie, every family gathering. It hurts. You grieve for something you'll never have and it leaves you feeling broken and empty but also guilty because people like YOU make us feel like our grief is unjustified or unworthy. We're told \"oh but you havent' really LOST anything\" or \"it's not like you had a baby and they died\" which absolutely trivialises the grief. People don't seem to get it. And they make stupid remarks. \n\nInfertility is a very specific sort of grief and a very specific sort of hurt, one that those who don't experience I think really struggle to wrap their heads around. For those fortunate enough to have never once had to question their ability to concieve, to have the CHOICE to be childless or not, they never ever feel that sense of loss and have that choice forcibly taken from them. \n\nI was 17 when I was first told \"you won't be able to concieve naturally\" and at the time I had people thinking they were being helpful saying things like \"oh well you're young, you dont' want to think about babies yet anyway.\"\n\nno, but I kinda anticipated i'd have some sort of CHOICE in the matter and the ability to do so in the future thank you very much. \n\nYou need to appologise perfusely to your sister who didn't deserve you pouring salt in her wounds.

Maybe you were trying to help, maybe you meant for it to be sweet, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, but you really need to take a look at what it was you just said to someone who's mourning the loss of their ability to bring life into this world. Who already feels inadequate, heartbroken, lost, confused, etc. And now probably feels like her sister doesn't care.
