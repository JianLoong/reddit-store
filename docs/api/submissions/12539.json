Her head knew she was not at fault, but she was saying that not being able to give her husband \"the gift of children\", which is seen to most people as a wifely duty made her feel broken and not whole. \n\nFinally she consulted her doctor, only to be diagnosed with endometriosis. A simple surgery, which was scheduled for last week, was supposed to correct the problem. She was ecstatic. Only to come out of anesthesia and be told by the doctor that he is sorry but children would not be an option. \n\nAs you can imagine, she felt devasted by these news. Yesterday I went to visit her to try to lift her spirits. I told her how incredibly sorry I was. But then I also added that being infertile may not be all that bad. Raising kids isn't all sunshine and roses. There is the added stress, expenses, sleep deprivation and time commitment. I told her to look at all the unhappy couples with kids, and that at least she and her husband would enjoy some extra freedom.\n\nAfter these comments, my sister's sadness turned into anger. She started shouting at me and told me to leave her house. She had also informed our mother because she called me later to tell me that my comments were disgusting and I should feel ashamed of myself. I feel like me trying to help my sister only made the situation worse.", "created_utc": 1679068522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tv1vx/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_better_off/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one who dreams of being a parent thinks it's an easy job and that it's going to be easy peasy. Telling people to essentially get over their grief is not helpful or kind.

Her head knew she was not at fault, but she was saying that not being able to give her husband \"the gift of children\", which is seen to most people as a wifely duty made her feel broken and not whole. \n\nFinally she consulted her doctor, only to be diagnosed with endometriosis. A simple surgery, which was scheduled for last week, was supposed to correct the problem. She was ecstatic. Only to come out of anesthesia and be told by the doctor that he is sorry but children would not be an option. \n\nAs you can imagine, she felt devasted by these news. Yesterday I went to visit her to try to lift her spirits. I told her how incredibly sorry I was. But then I also added that being infertile may not be all that bad. Raising kids isn't all sunshine and roses. There is the added stress, expenses, sleep deprivation and time commitment. I told her to look at all the unhappy couples with kids, and that at least she and her husband would enjoy some extra freedom.\n\nAfter these comments, my sister's sadness turned into anger. She started shouting at me and told me to leave her house. She had also informed our mother because she called me later to tell me that my comments were disgusting and I should feel ashamed of myself. I feel like me trying to help my sister only made the situation worse.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If someone were talking about wanting children and didn't know they were infertile, it wouldn't be horrible to discuss the cons of having children. It's a logical discussion and it's not a bad idea to make sure someone isn't romanticizing parenthood. Make sure they understand all angles. Ok. Let's try something else. Marriage. If someone is discussing that they want to get married, it is perfectly acceptable to discuss with them the cons of getting married. It's a big step and a serious decision. There's nothing wrong with wanting to make sure that someone has considered all aspects of marriage. Now, if a guy was discussing proposing to his girlfriend and his girlfriend gets killed before he can ask, it's *not okay* and is *really horrible* to have that same discussion with him. He doesn't want to hear about the cons of marriage and how he lucked out that his girlfriend passed away because he's avoiding all the cons of marriage. There's a time and a place and when someone is grieving, that's neither the time nor the place to discuss other perspectives.", "How did that work out for you? \n\nWhether you can understand why it\u2019s terrible or not, your sister experienced it as terrible. Do you want to be supportive and compassionate, or do you want to be right?\n\nYou are not right.  But also, try to let go of whether you are right.", "Because you\u2019re only thinking about your feelings not hers. That makes you the ah", "You are not even trying to understand what people are saying. Doesn't surprise me when it comes to you. Instead of trying to sympathize with your sister's grief, you thought it was better to make her see the \"brighter side\" of her not being able to conceive. If you did not have the willpower to sympathize with her, the least you could have done was listen to her or not visit her at all.\n\nYTA", "I don't think many people are unintelligent enough to want kids desperately but to not expect that there are stresses to it. You basically did an infertility version of telling a depressed person to look on the bright side. What's the point in saying it? People know that already, it doesn't change the circumstances.", "Jesus christ when people are grieving they don't need someone swooping in trying to \"**HeLp** tHeM sEe a DiFfErEnT pErSpEcTiVe\" (the audacity of thinking you can bring some fresh insight they surely haven't thought of!!)  just s*upport them through their grief* instead of trying to push them into bottling in up and getting over it for your convenience. \n\nYou were incredibly insensitive and out of line. YTA", "That\u2019s not a kind way to talk to anybody going through something bad, even if it\u2019s not as big as this.", "I sure hope *you* are childfree or at least mature a lot more before even thinking of having children. Like *a lot* a lot. You showed your sister the empathy of a rock and the sensitivity of a bull. Shame on you.", "\"Hey, I know you just had breast cancer, but think about all the money you'll save on bras\"\n\n\"I know you have 6 months to live, but at least you won't have to do any Christmas shopping this year!\"\n\nThat's you.\n\nThat's what you sound like.", "I hope your sister cuts you out of her life.", "Do you have a fucking heart at all???", "So if someone tells you they have a terminal disease you\u2019re going to point out all the cons of being alive and expect that to not be horrible?", "Honest question: Do you think this would have helped you if the roles were reversed? When things happen to you, does it help you grieve to hear about how whatever happened is for the best?", "What you said was absolutely heartless and devoid of any empathy whatsoever. That you can't see how horrible it was is very worrying.", "Nah to me it's obvious she cares about her sister and was trying to make her feel better. Yes she said the wrong thing but there was no malice maybe just ignorance. She's not an arsehole, an arsehole wouldn't be trying to comfort her in the first place", "When my wedding was cancelled because of COVID everyone was all \"I wish *I* had saved all the money instead of having a wedding.\"\n\nLike, no you don't, you decided to have a wedding instead...", "yep to both of those and the one I hate \"god wouldn't give you something you couldn't handle\"", "This. People say the stupidest crap. Honestly, I have learned to be super careful with what I say to people about their grief (big or small). I\u2019ve taught myself that sometimes, it\u2019s better to just be there for a person and not say anything, rather than make stupid remarks.", "I'd add \"God only gives you what you can handle\" to that list.", "My boss \"This is God's way of saying you weren't ready\" after informing her I had a miscarriage.", "Thank you kindly! She\u2019s ten years old now but I will tell you that it was not easy to bring her here", "Right! If that was true there would be far fewer/if any, suicides.", "That's the worst, most malignant lie of the bunch. People are given things they can't handle all the time.", "\"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\"\n\nBecause you never hear of someone turning to drugs or alcohol to try and cope with trauma."]}
