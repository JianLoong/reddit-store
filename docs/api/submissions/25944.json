Sarah has a different mother to my son\u2019s mother, Dana 47f. I live with my sons & Dana.\n\nAbout a month ago, Sarah\u2019s lease on her apartment ended, and she temporarily moved in with me since she wasn\u2019t able to secure another place to move into on time. She was sleeping on an air bed in Oliver\u2019s room. About 2 weeks into Sarah staying over, Dana and Oliver had an argument over something related to his school. I got involved when the argument started to get out of control. Sarah did not get involved as the argument had nothing to do with her. After the argument ended, I had to leave for work, before I left I saw that Dana had packed away the bed Sarah was sleeping on but didn\u2019t think anything of it as I could fill it with air again. Dana locked herself in our bedroom, like she usually does when we have arguments.\n\nWhen I got home around midnight, the arguments started again. Dana then turned to Sarah and said she didn\u2019t want her staying in our home anymore, even though the arguments had nothing to do with her. Sarah asked Dana if she decided she didn\u2019t want her to stay anymore when Dana put the bed away earlier, but she didn\u2019t respond. Sarah booked the first train to her mom\u2019s house but since she didn\u2019t have a bed to sleep on she sat on the sofa until about 5am when she left to get the train. (The train to her mom\u2019s takes 4 hours since she lives in a different city.)\nShe didn\u2019t say goodbye when she left.\n\nSarah managed to find another apartment to move into, and planned to come to my house to get her stuff. When she came back she greeted everyone before going to use the bathroom. While she was in the bathroom I texted to her \u201cYou need to say Hi and Bye properly and say thank you for letting you stay here and leaving your stuff here, never leave a bad impression wherever you go\u201d. When she came out of the bathroom she said Hi to Dana again but Dana didn\u2019t respond. When Sarah was ready to leave with her stuff she said to Dana \u201cthanks for letting me leave my stuff here\u201d and Dana said a quiet \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d. \n\nHours later I get a call from Sarah\u2019s mom telling me that I\u2019m an AH for sending that message to Sarah after I \u201callowed Dana to kick Sarah out when she needed a place to say\u201d and told me to stop wondering why Sarah never speaks to me or visits me when she gets treated the way she does. This honestly infuriated me because what was the point in Sarah sending her the message when she already knows her mom and I don\u2019t get along? When Sarah was growing up her mother always told me that I show favouritism to my sons since I only used to visit Sarah once a year. She lived 4 hours away before moving to the same city as me so how was it my fault that it was difficult to see her more than once? She says when Dana disrespects Sarah I find a way to defend Dana and put blame on Sarah which I just don\u2019t think is true.

Where was this good manners kick when your wife acted like an absolute wicked stepmother out of a Disney fairy tale?  Why haven't you demanded your wife apologize to your daughter for her disgusting behavior?\n\nNever mind, read the rest.  You're a worthless excuse for an asshole who couldn't put the bare minimum in to visit your daughter more than once a year (four-hour trip?  I did four hour round trips to hang out with friends for an evening).  You deserve to walk the infinite path of legos under the Saraha sun for all eternity and it still wouldn't make up for the assholeishness you've shown.", "YTA. You disrespected your daughter when she was growing up (four hours is NOT a long way to travel to have a decent relationship with your child.) And you allowed your wife to diarrapect her now. You've been a bad father to her.", "YTA - you allowed her to be kicked out even tho she did nothing wrong\u2026 she came back and said hello to everyone.. and then you texted her to say hi to everyone properly?!", "Based on current info, YTA! what did Sarah do to get kicked out, you didn't even ask and allowed Dana to just proceed?! \n\nAnd then you demand she greets you \"properly\"? Some cheek..\n\nNot to mention, 4 hours is peanuts when it comes to visiting your daughter. Did she at least come around more often?", "YTA.

Hilarious", "YTA your daughter did nothing wrong but she was the one who suffers you didn't stop your wife from kicking her out you just let your wife walk all over her. She then sat on your sofa for hours before going home, that should have been your time to talk to her and offer help even try and talk your wife around. Then she comes back for her things I mean the least you can do is keep her things safe when you kicked her out and you demand she talk properly honestly reading that text feels like advice from your boss on a job interview. Your daughter was the bigger person than your wife in all this situation. \nAlso it's not your daughter's fault they moved four hours away. You should have made the effort to see her more than once a year that's ridiculously little. You've taken your relationship with your daughter for granted and that she will always come back.", "YTA and a shit father. I\u2019m not even going to speak for this occasion, I want to concentrate on this: wym it\u2019s not your fault you didn\u2019t visit your daughter more than once a year cause \u201cshe lived 4h away\u201d?? Who\u2019s fault is it if her parents divorced? Hers? THERES PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL 4H A DAY TO GO TO WORK AND YOU CANNOT DO IT ONCE EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS/MONTHS TO SEE YOUR OWN FREAKING DAUGHTER? \n\nYour ex wife is right in all she said.

Did you have a conversation with your wife after Sarah  said \u201chi\u201d and Dana didn\u2019t respond? Seems like you don\u2019t like your daughter. As for visiting only once a year when they lived 4 hours away, she\u2019s your kid man. 4 hours isn\u2019t 4 days, you could\u2019ve made more time to go see your daughter and show her you loved her with time and attention.

Her mom is right.", "You decided to discipline your daughter when she was the victim of your wife\u2019s anger. \n\nYou showed your own daughter that you don\u2019t think she deserves to be treated fairly.

Daughter, who has been kicked out, leaves as asked.\n\nNow you are infuriated at daughter because she wasn't polite enough when she left after being kicked out for no reason and told her mom what you did.\n\nPlease make this make sense. Your daughter is the only adult in your household. From what you wrote, her mom's assessment of the situation is dead on.\n\nYTA.", "YTA your daughter had to sit on the sofa all night because you put her bed away!!!

How do you expect her to be kind with you?", "YTA\n\nNot only for the text message (\ud83d\ude44) ,  but you visited her once a year because she lived 4 hours away?! \n\nMy grandkids live 5-5\u00bd hours away, and I've seen them 7 times so far this year alone.", "YTA - your wife threw your daughter out like trash and you didn\u2019t defend her or stick up for her, and you blame your KID for that? It is your fault you were an absent father. That is 100% your fault.  It is also your fault your wife treats her poorly.", "YTA. I'm guessing Dana and the boys are your real family and Sarah just exists. I'm saying this because you allow Dana to treat her like shit and you did nothing to stop her or support Sarah. You're not just an AH, you're a lousy dad.", "Your daughter ONLY lives 4 hours away, and you're using that as an excuse to only see her once a year??? Also, why are you allowing your wife to disrespect your daughter?\n\nYTA 100%", "YTA all the way around. Not only did you let your wife KICK YOUR CHILD OUT in the middle of the night, then you instruct your kid to \"properly\" greet everyone after she already did, then you let your wife act like a spoiled teen. Did you reprimand her too? I probably would've told you to F OFF as I walked out the door. Your daughter acted more mature than your wife and you. 4 hours away...BFG, dude...you're not a dad in any sense of the word.", "YTA. So you let Dana kick her out in the middle of the night. What kind of parent are you? A shitty one.  So you actually made you daughter say thank you for being kicked out. That is unreal and you wonder if you are an AH. Let me help you out with the answer, you are a giant asshole and a bad parent.", "YTA.  You actually let your wife kick your daughter out of the house for no reasons and you treat her like a little child.  How to be a shitty parent in two easy steps.", "YTA\n\nYou let your wife walk all over your daughter and did nothing about it. In fact you found a way to blame your daughter for your wife's horrific behavior. If this is how you're going to treat Sarah, stop calling yourself her father because you're nothing more than a sperm donor", "Yeah YTA. Only an asshole could expect his daughter to apologise for the behaviour of his asshole wife. Seems like you and Dana are 2 peas in a pod. Assholes united. \n\nWhy did you allow Dana to kick Sarah out? Sarah had nothing to do with your argument. It was a power play on Dana's part and you allowed it. Utterly pathetic.\n\nSarah is better off away from your shitty branch of the family.", "YTA. You let that (omitted cause i don't think name calling is allowed) run your daughter off for no good reason. Your text about proper goodbyes was just the cherry on top.", "YTA - You are a massive asshole. No others aren't going to agree with you because you are a shitty father. I've seen my friend's kid more every year, who lives 3 states away from me, than you saw your kid when she was growing up. If you were any type of decent father you would have made time for your child. \n\nThen you let your asshole wife kick your daughter out for LITERALLY NO REASON. You didn't even try to defend your daughter on this. That's what your wife wanted so that's what she got, because you are both massive assholes. And then when she comes to get her stuff you tell her that she should properly say bye and thank you! FOR WHAT?!! She's supposed to thank you for Kicking her out for literally no reason when she needed a place to stay. \n\nDon't be surprised when your daughter goes no contact with you because you are an asshole father. When you get old and your golden sons aren't there for you DO NOT contact your daughter because you have never been there for her.", "So I understand correctly \n\n- your wife and son got in to an argument and your daughter wasn\u2019t/didn\u2019t get involved - you said nothing\n\n- your wife packs up your daughters bed - you say nothing\n\n- your wife decides without reason to kick your daughter out - you say nothing\n\n- your daughter leaves the house after sitting on the sofa for hours - you say nothing \n\n- your daughter returns to the house for her things, goes to the bathroom - you text her while she\u2019s actively using the bathroom to say hello/goodbye/thank you \n\n\nYTA - the reason is because you DID NOTHING until you got an your high horse about manners after wait for it\u2026SAYING/DOING NOTHING prior. \n\nYou even say there was no reason given for kicking out your daughter. You didn\u2019t bother to try to figure it out or make sure things were okay. Your ex is right, you were disrespectful to your daughter and don\u2019t seem to care about her.

And a hilariously pathetic inept oblivious one at that.  So, your lovely wife throws out your daughter in the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT for no discernible reason.  Nice manners.

Everything you wrote is atrocious!! I can't believe you even call yourself a father. So, she gets kicked out for no reason other than Dana deemed it so and Dana didn't even have the balls to tell her, she was just passive aggressive about it. And then you made her eat shit and smile and thank you for the opportunity. God, you and Dana are the worst. And I hope when your old and unable to take care of yourself, you never need anything from Sarah.", "YTA. When you do not get invited to the wedding, she asks another man or her mom to walk her down the aisle and you don't get to see the grandkids, you know why. \n\nAnd boohoo, your ex got on your ass about treating your daughter poorly and you want to know what the point of telling the ex is? Because the ex is the only one treating her daughter well. \n\nYou are really wrong and I don't think anyone is going to agree with you. You didn't see anything wrong with your wife kicking your daughter out after she had an argument with your son and then chastised your daughter about manners!", "YTA.\n\nFirstly, Sarah is a bloody angel. I'd have let you have it. And she has every right to tell her mother what happened. \n\nSecondly, I'd like to hear more about the conversation where you told Dana not to take her anger out on your daughter, to show some damn respect to your daughter and to apologise for being such an AH to her.\n\n...or did that not happen?\n\nAt least Sarah as a mother who will advocate for her.", "YTA. I drive 3.5 hours every weekend to see my cat while I work seasonally in another city. If the train takes 4 hours, it's probably 1.5-2 hour drive. Sarah's mom hit the nail right on the head.

With family like you, who needs mortal enemies?", "So, Dana has garbage communication skills (picks fights with her child, kicks someone out by deflating a bed and not even bothering to tell them), yet Sarah is the one who gets the instructional text on the proper way to say hello and goodbye and thank you? \n\nLOL YTA", "YTA you\u2019re correcting your daughter but not your wife? Why would you allow your wife to kick her out for no reason then thank the woman treating her like crap? Definitely not the time for a lesson on manners when you showed very poor etiquette here my dude", "YTA for not treating your daughter well and letting your wife kick her out like that. Once a year yet only 4 hours away? Texting your daughter to dictate manners that weren't necessary or even earned? Yeah, you really failed as a dad.", "I dont understand your issue at all...  yta", "Yeah, pretty clear one, YTA", "YTA, what on earth made you think that was okay. What on earth made you think it was okay for her to get her bed removed in the first place. That is horrible, and I hope she never talks to you again until you APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY.

Lmaooooo I visit college friends and second removed cousins more often than that. Pathetic.", "Why is Sarah the scapegoat for Dana's pissy mood? And why are you backing it up?

YTA.", "YTA. The more you respond to other people's comments, the more horrible you sound. How could you have let your wife kick out your daughter for no apparent reason? Your wife dragged your daughter into the fight and troubled her for no reason. Because she stated that she did not want your daughter in your home, you simply consented without standing up for her. And this demonstrates your favouritism. Nobody can grasp your point of view since it is without foundation. Do your daughter a favour and quit reaching out to her. Free her from your miserable ideals and teachings. Simply paying for her schooling and other essentials does not qualify you as her father. You've never stood up for her, and you'll never be able to.

Heck, my nieces' dad lives on another CONTINENT and they see him several times a year!!\n\nFour hours away and he only saw her once a year. JFC, I can't imagine how that must have hurt her. And then letting the stepmother throw her out because of a fight she wasn't even involved in . . .", "Sarah alienates herself but not speaking to us or visiting outside of her staying with us.", "Dana is the wife, Sarah is the daughter.", "Whoa, Dad, is that you? \n\nJK, I\u2019m no contact with my dad almost 10 years because of shit like it.  Enjoy it OP, cuz YTA big time.", ">She didn\u2019t do anything to get kicked out as far as I\u2019m aware\n\nSo your wife kicked her out for *literally no reason at all* and you still insisted on your daughter being polite to this woman who screwed her over? Yeah how could you possibly not realize YTA?\n\nListen, there are two definitions of \"respect.\" One is to respect someone as a person, and one is to respect someone as an authority. Assholes tend to say, \"If you don't respect me, I won't respect you,\" and mean, \"If you don't respect me *as an authority,* I won't respect you *as a person.*\" You and your wife are doing exactly that. Your wife is showing no respect for your daughter *as a person,* and you're still insisting on your daughter bending the knee to her *as an authority.* \n\nYou deprived your own daughter of a safe place to sleep, one of the basic human necessities, and you're quibbling about her not being the very most polite to someone who obviously *hates her*? Because let's be real, kicking someone out for no reason is a *hateful* thing to do. It's cruel. Why should anyone play nice with someone who obviously and plainly hates their guts and doesn't even consider them as a human being with needs and inherent dignity?", "And you just let her get kicked out like that? do all our comments not help you realize you haven't done well by Sarah...?", "Then why did you allow her to be kicked out?", "Why did you allow your wife to kick her out?", "She didn't do anything to get kicked out as far as you're aware?!? Wtf is wrong with you?\nWhat kind of father are you to \"Sarah\"? She gets kicked out and you can't even be arsed to find out why, but the only thing on your mind is saying Hi and bye properly?\n\nI sincerely hope your daughter never has to rely on you ever again for anything.\nIn case you haven't figured it out, you're a mahoosive AH.\n YTA", "Okay, but that's super crappy.... why would you be okay with her treating your child like that???? YTA big time, you don't just kick your kid out for no good reason", "Then you should have immediately told Dana \u201cNo, my daughter is staying.\u201d I mean what the fuck man? YTA", "And you didn\u2019t fight her on that? Challenge it? Stick up for your kid?", "And you just went with it? Do you have no heart? Do you know the term empathy? I would suggest looking it up and trying to have some. Good luck trying to have any relationship with her. Hopefully by the time you realize she never talks to you again.", "You chose a great throw away a user name as you threw away your role as dad.", "And you don't even care enough about the child you only saw once a year growing up to ASK YOUR WIFE TO AT LEAST GIVE YOU A REASON why she's throwing her out the house?! \n\nWhat is even wrong with you? Do you just not love your daughter at all?", "And you think this is OK? With a train in the early hours and no bed to sleep on? Grow a spine.", "She's your daughter. She was there before Dana. You're just a deadbeat.", "Have you always been a pathetic doormat?", "You and Dana are such shitty parents and assholes...", "I would too if I was treated so terribly", "How do you not consider yourself a horrible dad?", "man, i really hope your kids grow up and see what a pathetic person you are and not follow your example, maybe they can have a relationship with their sister then. you're a shitty father who puts a woman above his children. sarah did absolutely nothing to be treated like she was. it's not her job to grovel for your affection, it's your job as her parent to be there and supportive.", "I wonder why she would do that? Is it because you\u2019ve never stood up to your AH wife for Sarah? Or maybe because you only visited her once per year? You are a weak man and should be ashamed of how you\u2019ve treated your daughter. You probably won\u2019t though. You\u2019ll never understand how much of a failure you are. Your AH wife kicked her out in the middle of the night for no reason and you just sat on your thumbs. Pathetic. Hopefully your sons have a better male figure to look up to than you.", "Sarah is still practically a child. The onus is on YOU, as the adult in the situation, to BE THE ADULT and maintain a relationship. You have failed her and consistently shown her that you just can't be bothered to be there for her.", "You alienated yourself from your daughter. You lived 4 hours away and only visited once a year ?", "Thank you", "Incase you actually meant it when you said you can\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong in your behaviour - get a therapist now.", "I still don\u2019t think anybody is seeing things from my point of view. I\u2019m not just a potato, I paid for things for her growing up and still help her out every now and then.", "Well she and Dana don\u2019t really speak, and my son is barley ever at home so there was no reason to me as to why she didn\u2019t want Sarah there.", "Because he doesn\u2019t have the balls to do it", "Well no, this is Dana\u2019s house just as much as it is mine.", "Can you imagine having such a pathetic doormat for a parent?", "She is your daughter, you did your duty , your wife is a bully and you are a spineless pathetic husband", "Your right a potato has a use.", "Oh you paid for things? Wow. My daughters dad works in a whole other country but sees her more than once a year. Also your daughter did nothing wrong and you allowed your wife to kick her out. You\u2019re either spineless or don\u2019t give a crap about your daughter.", ">I paid for things for her growing up and still help her out every now and then\n\nYou don't get bonus points for doing less than the bare minimum.", "Kids want relationships, not just money.", "OP, being a father =/= being a cash dispenser, where is the emotional support and the sticking up for her? Providing guidance, etc.?", "Maybe you need to realize that your point of view makes you an asshole. Obviously you won\u2019t learn from this and be a better father but I hope your daughter has a happy life without you in it.", "A moldy, rotten potato is what you are, sickening people with your obnoxious fumes", "Maybe you aren\u2019t able to effectively articulate your point of view, because not one person here understands why you would allow your daughter to be arbitrarily tossed into the street in the middle of the night and why you sat there like a potato while it was happening. Potato, potahto.", "You want credit for things you are supposed to do. SAD.", "Did you pay for her train ticket after your wife kicked her out in the middle of the night for no reason?", "You insult potatoes with that statement. Unless there is a huge amount of info left out, Dana had zero reason to get involved and zero reason for kicking Sarah out. You stood by and let that happen... and then shift blame onto your daughter for venting to her mom, as her dad is emotionally stunted....", "That's because your POV is BS.\nYour duty is to defend your daughter against the bully you married. You didn't. \nYTA 10000 times.", "Well la dee da get the potato an award", "Wow dad of the year  /s", "Do you want an award for that?", "YTA and your whining makes it clear how much of an AH. You failed as a father to your daughter, apparently for her whole life.", "I don't want to believe that you exist and are such a bad person", "Why in the hell wouldn\u2019t you ask?  You\u2019re not a father, you\u2019re a callous stranger", "So why didn't you question it? \n\nWhy didn't you protect your daughter from being kicked out for no reason?", "Which means it\u2019s also as much yours as hers. You can\u2019t wash your hands of culpability here.", "Yeah...you're an awful father and I can't wait till your daughter cuts you out of her life. It's obvious to everyone who really matters to you. Does Dana also outrank your sons??   \n\n\nALSO YTA.", "Nope that is only Dana\u2019s house you don\u2019t have much of a say , you are just a puppy , you just stay there , exist and obey and defend her like a worthless father you are", "Which means it your house as much as her\u2019s. So why didn\u2019t you stand up for your daughter?", "Not when Dana is CRAZY. She kicked out your daughter because of a fight she was having with her son...a fight your daughter wasn't even involved in. She lost her decision-making privileges at that point. And then you decided that, instead of supporting your daughter, you were going to lecture her on being polite? She's literally getting kicked out in the middle of the night for NO REASON. Politeness is not the issue at that point. YTA and you're failing your daughter when she needs you. Do better.", "It was also supposed to be you DAUGHTER'S house as well. Grow up, get therapy, and stop making excuses for your terrible behavior.", "YTA, I'm impressed you fathered a child given your lack of balls.", "And they bring joy.", "I\u2019m guessing both", "No.", "Info: Did and do you spend time with your sons? If yes, why do you think you are doing it? Because you love them and think it is important to spend time with your children?", "Why not?", "Well they have lived with me their entire lives so why wouldn\u2019t I?", "So it was just convenient? Orherwise you would see them once a year as well? Or would you take on a drive once in a while just to see them? Why is this too much for your daughter? Because she was not born to the woman you love? Is she not as valuable than your sons?", "Looking at the ages, wanna bet he was seeing Dana while still with Sarah's mom? I'm sure she had a part in OP only visiting once a year, too"]}
