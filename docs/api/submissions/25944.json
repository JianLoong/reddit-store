Sarah has a different mother to my son\u2019s mother, Dana 47f. I live with my sons & Dana.\n\nAbout a month ago, Sarah\u2019s lease on her apartment ended, and she temporarily moved in with me since she wasn\u2019t able to secure another place to move into on time. She was sleeping on an air bed in Oliver\u2019s room. About 2 weeks into Sarah staying over, Dana and Oliver had an argument over something related to his school. I got involved when the argument started to get out of control. Sarah did not get involved as the argument had nothing to do with her. After the argument ended, I had to leave for work, before I left I saw that Dana had packed away the bed Sarah was sleeping on but didn\u2019t think anything of it as I could fill it with air again. Dana locked herself in our bedroom, like she usually does when we have arguments.\n\nWhen I got home around midnight, the arguments started again. Dana then turned to Sarah and said she didn\u2019t want her staying in our home anymore, even though the arguments had nothing to do with her. Sarah asked Dana if she decided she didn\u2019t want her to stay anymore when Dana put the bed away earlier, but she didn\u2019t respond. Sarah booked the first train to her mom\u2019s house but since she didn\u2019t have a bed to sleep on she sat on the sofa until about 5am when she left to get the train. (The train to her mom\u2019s takes 4 hours since she lives in a different city.)\nShe didn\u2019t say goodbye when she left.\n\nSarah managed to find another apartment to move into, and planned to come to my house to get her stuff. When she came back she greeted everyone before going to use the bathroom. While she was in the bathroom I texted to her \u201cYou need to say Hi and Bye properly and say thank you for letting you stay here and leaving your stuff here, never leave a bad impression wherever you go\u201d. When she came out of the bathroom she said Hi to Dana again but Dana didn\u2019t respond. When Sarah was ready to leave with her stuff she said to Dana \u201cthanks for letting me leave my stuff here\u201d and Dana said a quiet \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d. \n\nHours later I get a call from Sarah\u2019s mom telling me that I\u2019m an AH for sending that message to Sarah after I \u201callowed Dana to kick Sarah out when she needed a place to say\u201d and told me to stop wondering why Sarah never speaks to me or visits me when she gets treated the way she does. This honestly infuriated me because what was the point in Sarah sending her the message when she already knows her mom and I don\u2019t get along? When Sarah was growing up her mother always told me that I show favouritism to my sons since I only used to visit Sarah once a year. She lived 4 hours away before moving to the same city as me so how was it my fault that it was difficult to see her more than once? She says when Dana disrespects Sarah I find a way to defend Dana and put blame on Sarah which I just don\u2019t think is true.

Where was this good manners kick when your wife acted like an absolute wicked stepmother out of a Disney fairy tale?  Why haven't you demanded your wife apologize to your daughter for her disgusting behavior?\n\nNever mind, read the rest.  You're a worthless excuse for an asshole who couldn't put the bare minimum in to visit your daughter more than once a year (four-hour trip?  I did four hour round trips to hang out with friends for an evening).  You deserve to walk the infinite path of legos under the Saraha sun for all eternity and it still wouldn't make up for the assholeishness you've shown.", "YTA. You disrespected your daughter when she was growing up (four hours is NOT a long way to travel to have a decent relationship with your child.) And you allowed your wife to diarrapect her now. You've been a bad father to her.", "YTA - you allowed her to be kicked out even tho she did nothing wrong\u2026 she came back and said hello to everyone.. and then you texted her to say hi to everyone properly?!", "Based on current info, YTA! what did Sarah do to get kicked out, you didn't even ask and allowed Dana to just proceed?! \n\nAnd then you demand she greets you \"properly\"? Some cheek..\n\nNot to mention, 4 hours is peanuts when it comes to visiting your daughter. Did she at least come around more often?", "YTA.

Hilarious", "YTA your daughter did nothing wrong but she was the one who suffers you didn't stop your wife from kicking her out you just let your wife walk all over her. She then sat on your sofa for hours before going home, that should have been your time to talk to her and offer help even try and talk your wife around. Then she comes back for her things I mean the least you can do is keep her things safe when you kicked her out and you demand she talk properly honestly reading that text feels like advice from your boss on a job interview. Your daughter was the bigger person than your wife in all this situation. \nAlso it's not your daughter's fault they moved four hours away. You should have made the effort to see her more than once a year that's ridiculously little. You've taken your relationship with your daughter for granted and that she will always come back.", "YTA and a shit father. I\u2019m not even going to speak for this occasion, I want to concentrate on this: wym it\u2019s not your fault you didn\u2019t visit your daughter more than once a year cause \u201cshe lived 4h away\u201d?? Who\u2019s fault is it if her parents divorced? Hers? THERES PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL 4H A DAY TO GO TO WORK AND YOU CANNOT DO IT ONCE EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS/MONTHS TO SEE YOUR OWN FREAKING DAUGHTER? \n\nYour ex wife is right in all she said.

Did you have a conversation with your wife after Sarah  said \u201chi\u201d and Dana didn\u2019t respond? Seems like you don\u2019t like your daughter. As for visiting only once a year when they lived 4 hours away, she\u2019s your kid man. 4 hours isn\u2019t 4 days, you could\u2019ve made more time to go see your daughter and show her you loved her with time and attention.

Daughter, who has been kicked out, leaves as asked.\n\nNow you are infuriated at daughter because she wasn't polite enough when she left after being kicked out for no reason and told her mom what you did.\n\nPlease make this make sense. Your daughter is the only adult in your household. From what you wrote, her mom's assessment of the situation is dead on.\n\nYTA.", "YTA your daughter had to sit on the sofa all night because you put her bed away!!! And she did nothing wrong, it was because of your fight with each other. How do you expect her to be kind with you?", "YTA\n\nNot only for the text message (\ud83d\ude44) ,  but you visited her once a year because she lived 4 hours away?! \n\nMy grandkids live 5-5\u00bd hours away, and I've seen them 7 times so far this year alone.", "YTA - your wife threw your daughter out like trash and you didn\u2019t defend her or stick up for her, and you blame your KID for that? It is your fault you were an absent father. That is 100% your fault.  It is also your fault your wife treats her poorly.", "YTA. I'm guessing Dana and the boys are your real family and Sarah just exists. I'm saying this because you allow Dana to treat her like shit and you did nothing to stop her or support Sarah. You're not just an AH, you're a lousy dad.", "Your daughter ONLY lives 4 hours away, and you're using that as an excuse to only see her once a year??? Also, why are you allowing your wife to disrespect your daughter?\n\nYTA 100%", "YTA all the way around. Not only did you let your wife KICK YOUR CHILD OUT in the middle of the night, then you instruct your kid to \"properly\" greet everyone after she already did, then you let your wife act like a spoiled teen. Did you reprimand her too? I probably would've told you to F OFF as I walked out the door. Your daughter acted more mature than your wife and you. 4 hours away...BFG, dude...you're not a dad in any sense of the word.", "YTA. So you let Dana kick her out in the middle of the night. What kind of parent are you? A shitty one.  So you actually made you daughter say thank you for being kicked out. That is unreal and you wonder if you are an AH. Let me help you out with the answer, you are a giant asshole and a bad parent.", "YTA.  You actually let your wife kick your daughter out of the house for no reasons and you treat her like a little child.  How to be a shitty parent in two easy steps.", "YTA\n\nYou let your wife walk all over your daughter and did nothing about it. In fact you found a way to blame your daughter for your wife's horrific behavior. If this is how you're going to treat Sarah, stop calling yourself her father because you're nothing more than a sperm donor", "Yeah YTA. Only an asshole could expect his daughter to apologise for the behaviour of his asshole wife. Seems like you and Dana are 2 peas in a pod. Assholes united. \n\nWhy did you allow Dana to kick Sarah out? Sarah had nothing to do with your argument. It was a power play on Dana's part and you allowed it. Utterly pathetic.\n\nSarah is better off away from your shitty branch of the family.", "YTA. You let that (omitted cause i don't think name calling is allowed) run your daughter off for no good reason. Your text about proper goodbyes was just the cherry on top.", "YTA - You are a massive asshole. No others aren't going to agree with you because you are a shitty father. I've seen my friend's kid more every year, who lives 3 states away from me, than you saw your kid when she was growing up. If you were any type of decent father you would have made time for your child. \n\nThen you let your asshole wife kick your daughter out for LITERALLY NO REASON. You didn't even try to defend your daughter on this. That's what your wife wanted so that's what she got, because you are both massive assholes. And then when she comes to get her stuff you tell her that she should properly say bye and thank you! FOR WHAT?!! She's supposed to thank you for Kicking her out for literally no reason when she needed a place to stay. \n\nDon't be surprised when your daughter goes no contact with you because you are an asshole father. When you get old and your golden sons aren't there for you DO NOT contact your daughter because you have never been there for her.", "So I understand correctly \n\n- your wife and son got in to an argument and your daughter wasn\u2019t/didn\u2019t get involved - you said nothing\n\n- your wife packs up your daughters bed - you say nothing\n\n- your wife decides without reason to kick your daughter out - you say nothing\n\n- your daughter leaves the house after sitting on the sofa for hours - you say nothing \n\n- your daughter returns to the house for her things, goes to the bathroom - you text her while she\u2019s actively using the bathroom to say hello/goodbye/thank you \n\n\nYTA - the reason is because you DID NOTHING until you got an your high horse about manners after wait for it\u2026SAYING/DOING NOTHING prior. \n\nYou even say there was no reason given for kicking out your daughter. You didn\u2019t bother to try to figure it out or make sure things were okay. Your ex is right, you were disrespectful to your daughter and don\u2019t seem to care about her.

And a hilariously pathetic inept oblivious one at that.  So, your lovely wife throws out your daughter in the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT for no discernible reason.  Nice manners.

Everything you wrote is atrocious!! I can't believe you even call yourself a father. So, she gets kicked out for no reason other than Dana deemed it so and Dana didn't even have the balls to tell her, she was just passive aggressive about it. And then you made her eat shit and smile and thank you for the opportunity. God, you and Dana are the worst. And I hope when your old and unable to take care of yourself, you never need anything from Sarah.", "YTA. When you do not get invited to the wedding, she asks another man or her mom to walk her down the aisle and you don't get to see the grandkids, you know why. \n\nAnd boohoo, your ex got on your ass about treating your daughter poorly and you want to know what the point of telling the ex is? Because the ex is the only one treating her daughter well. \n\nYou are really wrong and I don't think anyone is going to agree with you. You didn't see anything wrong with your wife kicking your daughter out after she had an argument with your son and then chastised your daughter about manners!", "YTA.\n\nFirstly, Sarah is a bloody angel. I'd have let you have it. And she has every right to tell her mother what happened. \n\nSecondly, I'd like to hear more about the conversation where you told Dana not to take her anger out on your daughter, to show some damn respect to your daughter and to apologise for being such an AH to her.\n\n...or did that not happen?\n\nAt least Sarah as a mother who will advocate for her.", "YTA. I drive 3.5 hours every weekend to see my cat while I work seasonally in another city. If the train takes 4 hours, it's probably 1.5-2 hour drive. Sarah's mom hit the nail right on the head.

With family like you, who needs mortal enemies?", "So, Dana has garbage communication skills (picks fights with her child, kicks someone out by deflating a bed and not even bothering to tell them), yet Sarah is the one who gets the instructional text on the proper way to say hello and goodbye and thank you? \n\nLOL YTA", "YTA you\u2019re correcting your daughter but not your wife? Why would you allow your wife to kick her out for no reason then thank the woman treating her like crap? Definitely not the time for a lesson on manners when you showed very poor etiquette here my dude", "YTA for not treating your daughter well and letting your wife kick her out like that.

Yeah, you really failed as a dad.", "I dont understand your issue at all...  yta", "Yeah, pretty clear one, YTA", "YTA, what on earth made you think that was okay. What on earth made you think it was okay for her to get her bed removed in the first place. That is horrible, and I hope she never talks to you again until you APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY.

Lmaooooo I visit college friends and second removed cousins more often than that. Pathetic.", "Why is Sarah the scapegoat for Dana's pissy mood? And why are you backing it up?

YTA.", "YTA. The more you respond to other people's comments, the more horrible you sound. How could you have let your wife kick out your daughter for no apparent reason? Your wife dragged your daughter into the fight and troubled her for no reason. Because she stated that she did not want your daughter in your home, you simply consented without standing up for her. And this demonstrates your favouritism. Nobody can grasp your point of view since it is without foundation. Do your daughter a favour and quit reaching out to her. Free her from your miserable ideals and teachings. Simply paying for her schooling and other essentials does not qualify you as her father. You've never stood up for her, and you'll never be able to.

Why is Dana not leaving a bad impression on YOU?\n\nAs far as I can tell, you grabbed onto the 1 thing Sarah might have not acted PERFECTLY about (to your standards) to justify Dana being a piece of work. I think MOST people wouldn't have been as calm as Sarah was in this situation. In my book, she went ABOVE and beyond to appease you. Sarah probably cares about you a good deal to be shafted like this and STILL trying to maintain peace with you.\n\nDana IGNORED Sarah saying hello?

THAT is how you are defending Dana. It isn't with direct action, you'd need a spine for that. Instead of confronting the problem - Dana - you are confronting the smallest slight you can come up and to boot its IN DANAS FAVOR. Dana needs politeness, but doesn't need to give it.\n\nI can't come up with a clearer way to say it: Sarah's mom is correct in her assessment of you.\n\nMy LANDLORDS have been more polite to me  than Dana was to your daughter. And I've been asked to leave properties. (Landlord selling the house during the 2021 boom).\n\nShe was sleeping on an air mattress, on the floor of a teenage boys room, looking for housing.

I got involved when the argument started to get out of control. Sarah did not get involved as the argument had nothing to do with her. After the argument ended, I had to leave for work, before I left I saw that Dana had packed away the bed Sarah was sleeping on but didn\u2019t think anything of it as I could fill it with air again. Dana locked herself in our bedroom, like she usually does when we have arguments.*\n\nWhy did you even get involved in this and not see it through to a resolution? Then when you saw the bed being put away you didn't even question it. Follow through instead of letting your wife go sulk away in the bedroom. \n\n*When I got home around midnight, the arguments started again. Dana then turned to Sarah and said she didn\u2019t want her staying in our home anymore, even though the arguments had nothing to do with her. Sarah asked Dana if she decided she didn\u2019t want her to stay anymore when Dana put the bed away earlier, but she didn\u2019t respond*\n\nSarah stayed out of the argument but you still allowed your wife to kick her out for no reason - at least none given. Your WIFE refused to even answer Sarah's question. \n\n*Sarah booked the first train to her mom\u2019s house but since she didn\u2019t have a bed to sleep on she sat on the sofa until about 5am when she left to get the train. (The train to her mom\u2019s takes 4 hours since she lives in a different city.) She didn\u2019t say goodbye when she left.*\n\nDude you made her stay up all night and then travel by train for 4 hours and you're upset she didn't say goodbye when she left. What was she supposed to do? Wake everyone up and give hugs and kisses? She had all night to think about how her own dad didn't defend her and was kicking her out for no reason. **She's hurt!**\n\n*Sarah managed to find another apartment to move into, and planned to come to my house to get her stuff. When she came back she greeted everyone before going to use the bathroom. While she was in the bathroom I texted to her \u201cYou need to say Hi and Bye properly and say thank you for letting you stay here and leaving your stuff here, never leave a bad impression wherever you go\u201d. When she came out of the bathroom she said Hi to Dana again but Dana didn\u2019t respond. When Sarah was ready to leave with her stuff she said to Dana \u201cthanks for letting me leave my stuff here\u201d and Dana said a quiet \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d.*\n\nSo let me get this straight. She still says hello to everyone when she comes back. Then you berate her for what? She didn't say hello the way **YOU** wanted? So she complies and again **your wife** can't be bothered to even be polite about it. You stand back and do nothing to stick up for your daughter.\n\n*Hours later I get a call from Sarah\u2019s mom telling me that I\u2019m an AH for sending that message to Sarah after I \u201callowed Dana to kick Sarah out when she needed a place to say\u201d and told me to stop wondering why Sarah never speaks to me or visits me when she gets treated the way she does. This honestly infuriated me because what was the point in Sarah sending her the message when she already knows her mom and I don\u2019t get along? When Sarah was growing up her mother always told me that I show favouritism to my sons since I only used to visit Sarah once a year. She lived 4 hours away before moving to the same city as me so how was it my fault that it was difficult to see her more than once? She says when Dana disrespects Sarah I find a way to defend Dana and put blame on Sarah which I just don\u2019t think is true. I really don\u2019t see how I\u2019m wrong here and I think others would agree too so, AITA?*\n\nWhy wouldn't she show the text to her mom. Her mom is the only one in this situation who is on her side. You've rejected her in countless ways and let your wife bully her - all while you sit back and allow it to happen. I'll even go so far as to say you were complicit in the bullying. \n\nYou saw her **once a year?????** 4 hrs is just too far. Poor baby. Just for reference here I drive 8 hrs (one way) once a month to visit my grown daughter. It's really not that hard to travel a few hours to see someone you care about.

And to tell her to express gratitude and say goodbye, when she had just walked in the door and hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. Did you think she wouldn\u2019t continue to be polite?

You are dead weight and her life will improve immeasurably without you in it.", "Why would you ask?? \n\n**Why didn\u2019t you care**? \n\nAlso how is not speaking to the man who abandoned her except for once a year, and telling her mom when she needs emotional support after you argue, doing anything wrong??", "You must be mentally challenged or something because you still don\u2019t understand basic communication. Why didn\u2019t you ASK why your first child was kicked out? I would be concerned as a parent to let my child travel at night and would wonder why she has to suddenly leave my house.", "Why would you ask you wife the reason she\u2019s kicking out your daughter randomly at midnight with no inciting event? You can\u2019t be serious. I refuse to believe you\u2019re this dense.", "Wow you are an awful parent", "Did you really just type that out? Your wife kicks your daughter out and you didn\u2019t think there was any need to ask why? You just accepted it. What a piece of work.", "I wouldn\u2019t speak to you, either.", "do you care even a little that your wife mistreats your daughter this way?", "If she never does anything wrong, then clearly she had no reason to be kicked out.", "And you think those are valid reasons for your wife to their your daughter out of your house??", "That your wife is an asshole and so are you", "Your a shit parent and probably Dana too. Good luck. I hope you never go to Sarah for anything.", "Because she's your daughter. She was depending on you and you let her down. Thereis a reason,  because if you EVER want to have a better relationship with your daughter, you should figure out why your wife is hellbent on ruining it.", "She hates your daughter and you're a shit enough dad to just let her kick your kid out. Those are her reasons", "YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED. for fuck sake man, this is your child! why don\u2019t you care about how she\u2019s treated by your fucking wife???", "That's your responsibility to find out. You find out by asking your wife, talking to your son and your daughter.\n\nI have a sneaky suspicion though, that maybe this is the daughter that is posting this, and that's why you don't know/can't find out?\n\nIf that's the case, I hope this post is very gratifying. The father in this post is a super asshole and a bad dad. The stepmother is an asshole too.", ">And what was that reason?\n\nAs Sarah's dad, that was your responsibility to find out as the situation escalated...but no, you just sat back, and watched it all unfold without a single thought about intervening on behalf of YOUR daughter.", "We don\u2019t know because we weren\u2019t there.  You were so you should have asked!  Do you have some sort of mental disorder that prevents you from understanding this concept, or are you being willfully ignorant?", "Do you have autism? Genuine question.", "You're so much worse than an AH.  You truly make excuses for NOT seeing your mate for the snarky person she is.  Are you afraid of her? SHE WAS WRONG.  Your daughter was not.  YOU ARE AN AH!!!!!!", "Dude you still haven't actually answered the question. Your wife decided your daughter had to leave-- and not only that, it sounds like she *decided* in the morning but then didn't say anything until it was too late for Sarah to get a train that night-- and you **do not care** -- didn't even blink!!\n\nYou did not spend even a moment thinking about this, as if it had nothing to do with you. You did not speak to your daughter about it. \n\n**You do not care one flying flip about your daughter**", "Yeah just a bad parent lol YTA", "Be honest to yourself, if Dana would have wanted her out that night, she would have been on the streets. If your story is real, you are one of the most pathetic human beings on earth.", "More like Throw Dad Away 4ever.\n\nYTA. Go stick to being a father to your sons since you don't give a shit about your daughter.", "Dad of the year ..", "That didn't answer the question.", "That's a pretty weak answer.", "Why wasn't she in your house?", "no thanks to you", "YOU\u2019RE A BAD PARENT!", "No fucking thanks to you, Sarah has nothing to be thankful for", "All of this for some little coochie, you are pathetic. YTA", "Hey, do you need the crayons version to why you're a complete failure of a father to her or are you just desperately trying to assauge your guilt?", "she was probably better in the street than with you,fending for herself, if you can even protect her from her stepmother (I wouldn't even call her that) when she was in the wrong, I doubt you could even protect her for anything else.", "Do you even like your daughter? Serious question. Everything you\u2019ve written sounds like you hold nothing but\u2026.indifference towards your daughter. \n\nIf you really don\u2019t understand why your ex wife sent you that email imagine you and Dana got divorced. Dana marries someone else but your boys, they continue living with you. Then when your son is 20, he decides to spend some time with Dana and her new husband (and their new kids). But two weeks later Dana\u2019s husband kicks out your son while Dana stays mute. How would you feel?", "TATERS precious", "He only cares that his daughter is not sufficiently grateful for her mistreatment and doesn't keep it secret from the parent who cares about her.\n\nBut what if she had said goodbye \"properly\" when she left at 5am? I'd bet that would have been wrong too, \"waking us up to get attention, why couldn't she just leave without disturbing the household after she already upset her stepmother by existing?\"", "he shouldn't, he only saw her one time a year, he should had change that to 0 and leave her alone, she doesn't even count on him so why bother", "We do not claim this man", "Ah man now I\u2019m hungry and craving tater tots :(", "So why did you not put effort in to being a father for your first born child? You are a spineless coward with how you let your wife treat your daughter and your obvious favouritism. And your wife is just downright disgusting in every way. Thank you for making it apparent to everyone, except yourself somehow, that you have blatantly mistreated your daughter and allow your crone of a wife to do so as well.\n\nYTA, and I hope your daughter completely contacts with you and your replacement family.", "She didn't live with you because her mom sees you for who you are. What have you done to prove otherwise? Bare minimum of spending some money on her. I'm very impressed.", "so if dana kicks out one of your sons would you be cool with it too?", "You wouldn't otherwise?", "So punish your daughter for something that is ENTIRELY out of her control? Are you fucking kidding me?!?\n\nWhy weren\u2019t you more involved in your daughter\u2019s life? Why didn\u2019t you live where she and her mother lived? Why didn\u2019t she see you more?\n\nYou were the adult. You made the choices here, not her. As a parent it was you responsibility to foster and maintain a good relationship with your daughter.", "So, you\u2019re just a sperm donor than? Got it!", "If they say a proper goodbye, he probably would be fine. Otherwise he would need to make an effort and write lectures while son's on the toilet."]}
