I was already there when she came so I didn't left (usually if she calls before then I would leave before she gets here). She stayed over for dinner. While we were eating, my stepson said \"daddy can you please give me juice?\" And handed me his glass. I served him and that could have been all, but of course the snake spoke. She asked him since when did he called me \"daddy\", he said that he don't knows but he likes to call me that because I'm a good dad for him and I'm younger than his other dad. Then she turned to my girlfriend and told her that she shouldn't encourage my relationship with her son that much because I'm just a temporary fix and I'll leave them eventually. Wtf?

NTA big time", "I'm sorry, what kind of a \"grandmother\" says that kind of shit to a kid? She knows full well that it's going to traumatise him. Yes, she is a snake.\n\nNTA, and yes, it would appear that she does, indeed, like to lie.", "NTA. It\u2019s your gfs choice how she wants to handle you around her child. The mom can say what she wants but not rudely in front of you and the child. No class, no tact. Just audacity and judgement.", "NTA. She is a snake. And she should be ashamed of herself.", "That was a battle your girlfriend should fight, not you.  You\u2019re not the asshole here at all but for your future sanity in dealing with her, let your girlfriend handle it", "NTA on my opinion. I mean, WOW she seems like a really difficult person. Like you said, who says stuff like that in front of a kid? Besides, a kid who seems to like and have an affection for you, since he calls you \u201cdaddy\u201d.\n\nOn the other side, I don\u2019t think that calling her a snake in front of the kid was a wise decision as well. I understand that she really got on your nerves and you didn\u2019t think it through in that moment\u2026 that could happen to anyone in your position.\n\nI think that if you feel bad you should talk to your gf and ask her opinion, how she felt as well, and see if you should talk to her son to explain that what you said wasn\u2019t cool (just so the kid understands that have a fight like this isn\u2019t the best behavior, you know? After all, I believe you are also kind of a role model \u2018cause you are his daddy).", "Hard NTA . Because she lobbed that out in front of the child, the child needed to hear the hard response back. If you'd let that comment slide by he'd have been left wondering if it was really true. If I'm your girlfriend I'm telling Grandma she's going to be asked to leave every single time she makes a rude comment about your relationship. And prepare to kick her out at least five times. And if that doesn't work she doesn't get to see her grandson.", "NTA my mom is the same way. It's almost like she's jealous.  When I stopped working to be a SAHM she kept telling me my husband would leave me and I'd be broke etc. Haters gotta hate.", "NTA but your girlfriend should've stepped in and handled that. I'm not sure I would've called her those names in front of her grandson, but she started it and made completely unnecessary comments in front of him so imo, an eye for an eye.", "NTA. She needs to learn manners, boundaries, and respect. Is she divorced by chance? Sounds like she's projecting.", "Granny needs to stop projecting. You could have called her much worse things considering her history of being hateful towards you, but to say something so awful in front of her grandchild is just evil. Put her in her place, but next time be more mindful of how you respond to such a serious question from him. If you stoop completely to her level, you become the very thing you despise. Still, NTA", "NTA.  You were being protective of the boy more than his own blood.  Yes, it would have been better to not use the word lying.  You don't know the future so it could further confuse the boy later but also because people like her thrive on the drama.  She seems to have been intentionally hoping for the chance to be hurtful on this matter.  She was so worried about her daughter making a mistake that she did not care that she hurt every person there, including herself.  Your girlfriend should have been the one to step in and she should be the one to step in now.  Her Mother needs to have a boundary put in place and told that her behavior is not acceptable and will no longer be tolerated.  The little boy needs to have someone explain to him further because he is likely very confused and concerned.  If your girlfriend isn't willing to do these things, it would make me pause and evaluate this relationship.", "NTA but she's a vicious one , snake was polite imo.", "hiss hiss\n\nnta", "You shouldn\u2019t have called her a snake. That\u2019s insulting to snakes. ;-)\n\nWhat an unbelievably mean thing of her to say. I can understand why you\u2019d be upset. I partially agree with your boss - I think your reaction did make things worse. But I also don\u2019t think you should have ignored it. The best course of action would have been to calmly talk about it and find out why she thinks that way. \n\nESH, but her way more than you.", "NTA\n\nI think you should have tried to be more diplomatic.  Points to the girlfriend though for asking her mom to leave.\n\nGF's mom needs some serious lessons in manners. Either her parents never taught her or she never listened on how to be a kind and considerate person.  Whether she believes it to be the truth or not... you just do not criticize someone in front of them like they are not even there.  This is beyond rude. \n\nI will say that you were probably angry and could have used more colourful language, but you chose to hold your tongue to some degree.  I am not sure what I would have said were I in your shoes.  \n\nNext time, try this on for size:\n\nI just want to make sure I heard you correctly.  Repeat what she said.  Did I have it correct?  If she says yes and if she is being rude. (Use my line)  Did your parents fail to teach you manners or did you choose not to listen?", "NTA. Definition of fuck around and find out. If your girlfriend doesn\u2019t have a problem with it, then why does your boss feel the need to weigh in?", "NTA. She was completely out of line and clearly projecting her own issues into you. I'm worried about the fact that your gf didn't speak up to defend you or to try to shield her son from this kind of conversation though.", ">I told him...that his grandmother just likes to lie.\n\nESH. She's out of line, but your response to this 9yo kid wasn't appropriate either. \n\nYour whole post sounds really childish, and why are you running to your boss to talk about all this? Your MIL sounds awful here, but she's got a front-row seat to your behaviour so she could be right while still being an asshole.", "ESH\n\nWhy this conversation was allowed to continue is beyond any rational explanation. Adults should act like adults especially in front of children!! Good luck trying to explain why it\u2019s not okay to call people bad names to that kid. Granny is an ah but the \u201cshe started it\u201d comment literally makes you sound like a 9 yo. You don\u2019t live with Mom & her kid ... imo ... this all sounds like you\u2019re in a weird Daddy competition with the kid\u2019s Dad", "Eh, you had me on your side until you told the kid she said you'd leave because she likes to lie. It's not really a lie, it's her opinion. She's the AH for even saying said opinion at the freaking dinner table in front of a 9 year old. Simply correcting her and saying you have no intentions of leaving them (there's never a guarantee that you won't break up) would have been appropriate. So soft YTA for that.", "ehh soft NTA. Grandma clearly instigated this whole thing, but you didn't exactly help matters by calling her a snake - I'd say you were maybe a little too aggressive but hard to fault you.", "See Kutcher, Ashton and Moore, Demi. Then again, I know of a successful 10-year difference. And you paying for some else\u2019s kid\u2019s college?", "YTA for calling your girlfriend's mom a \"snake\". While her comment was out of line and hurtful, your response was aggressive and disrespectful. It's important to communicate boundaries and defend yourself, but insulting her in front of her family was not appropriate. It's understandable that you were upset, but there were other ways to handle the situation without resorting to name-calling.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
