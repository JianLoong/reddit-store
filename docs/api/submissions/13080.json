You\u2019re not the asshole here at all but for your future sanity in dealing with her, let your girlfriend handle it", "NTA on my opinion. I mean, WOW she seems like a really difficult person. Like you said, who says stuff like that in front of a kid? Besides, a kid who seems to like and have an affection for you, since he calls you \u201cdaddy\u201d.\n\nOn the other side, I don\u2019t think that calling her a snake in front of the kid was a wise decision as well. I understand that she really got on your nerves and you didn\u2019t think it through in that moment\u2026 that could happen to anyone in your position.\n\nI think that if you feel bad you should talk to your gf and ask her opinion, how she felt as well, and see if you should talk to her son to explain that what you said wasn\u2019t cool (just so the kid understands that have a fight like this isn\u2019t the best behavior, you know?

You don't know the future so it could further confuse the boy later but also because people like her thrive on the drama.  She seems to have been intentionally hoping for the chance to be hurtful on this matter.  She was so worried about her daughter making a mistake that she did not care that she hurt every person there, including herself.  Your girlfriend should have been the one to step in and she should be the one to step in now.  Her Mother needs to have a boundary put in place and told that her behavior is not acceptable and will no longer be tolerated.  The little boy needs to have someone explain to him further because he is likely very confused and concerned.

The kid sees him as a fatherly role, and yes, we do know he has been in this relationship for over 2 years, which at least hints at some form of commitment. The kid sees him as a fatherly role model, at the least, which means he has put in some time with the kid during those 2 years. Grandma can ask questions in private all she wants, but that isn't what she did. She made an accusation at the dinner table to the child. And yes, none of us truly know how accurate her claims are being internet strangers. Is she lying? Is she not, we don't know?

Maybe phrase it as more of grandma wants what's best for you, and thinks she knows best, but you don't need to worry and know we do all love you. \n\nAnd why should he want to stick around if every time she and he are there, she pulls this crap. I have a great relationship with my ILs now, but in the beginning, I missed family gatherings because I was uncomfortable, and my husband refused to say anything. And I fully believed at that time his family his fight. Once I saw he was incapable of having the discussion I did, it was never a fight. Everything was aired, and we are in such a better place. Her mother is seemingly unwarrantedly hateful towards OP. The partner isn't stopping it, maybe for the same reason my husband couldn't, so he extricates himself from a bad situation so as to have no escalation. And if you read the story you have a very good idea why he leaves. Honestly, she just sounds like a JustNoMIL, and I would avoid those too if I were him.\n\nI've also known people not as lucky as me and when they have similar convos with their actual JustNOs. The argument usually goes (I'll bullet point it)\nJN: Well, I don't think they are committed because I never see it.\nPartner: You don't see it because from the beginning you have been rude to my partner so they avoid you.\nJN: I was never rude. I'm just worried for you. He is probably just a fly by night.\nPartner: he isn't a fly by night he has been a wonderful partner and has become an amazing bonus daddy both me and ex like.\nJN: Well, I just don't want to have to be your shoulder when he finally leaves and proves me right.\n\nAnd trust when I say you could throw most any response at me and I could from stories told to me work out enough response to win by having you be frustrated and giving in or just hanging up on me.
