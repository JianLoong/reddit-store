Why is her care so intensive for a guardian? What happens if your twin cannot manage all the tasks?\n\nWhat do you think is a good alternative to the situation that still provides ND sister with adequate care?", "What would have happened to your disabled sister if neither of you took on Guardianship?", "ESH.\n\nIn some ways, this post feels designed to hit at Reddit's buttons- being expected to care for someone against your wishes, being told your life is easy because you are childfree, etc.  This is a subreddit where people have said it was a-okay to send a niece or nephew into foster care, of course they are going to tell you that you don't owe your disabled sibling anything.\n\nYou don't owe it to your siblings or your dead parents to take over the guardianship, but some compassion wouldn't kill you.  \n\nA single mom of three kids under 10 is feeling overwhelmed and tried to get you to share responsibility for your disabled sibling.  Your response was \"I don't want to be a dick and say \"I told you so\" but that I warned her this would happen.\"  That is very literally an I told you so and it is a response that lacks compassion for someone who seems to be working very hard to take care of other people.\n\nYou seem to have a lot of anger towards your family, maybe you felt burdened by your sister growing up.  You have the right to set boundaries, but the level of anger and the \"I told you so\" energy isn't setting boundaries, it is being unkind.  Your sister didn't probably choose this responsibility because she wants to be a martyr, she chose this responsibility out of concern for your other sister and out of respect for your parents' wishes.  You should be able to respect that even if it isn't the choice you would make for yourself.  \n\nI am curious if you are involved at all with your disabled sister.  One of the reasons people don't sign custody over to the state is fear that the disabled person may suffer without a family advocate.  There may be options for you to take some of the burden off of your caretaking sibling without taking on legal guardianship, but I have a feeling you are not willing to do that.\n\nI also wonder if you have ever sought out therapy to discuss your feelings for your family.  The amount of anger and derision here makes me think you might benefit from therapy, regardless of your involvement in the current situation.", "NTA\n\nShe asked, and you answered. Not only that, you told her what the answer would be. \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to look after your sister- instead, they relied on their other children to take care of her as their plan.  This is never a good plan.\n\nIt\u2019s not children\u2019s job to pick up the slack. \n\nWhile I do feel for your twin sister, caregiving, burnout is really easy to get, she didn\u2019t heed advice given.\n\nBut really, your parents are the biggest AH in this story.", "You were very clear that you can't handle that level of responsibility and gave your reasons why. She didn't listen, took on the load, and now expects you to drop everything and replace her as the main guardian. That's not fair. I get loving your ND sister and wanting the best for her, but not if it's detrimental to your own life or mental health if there's other options. Your parents did it because that's their child. It's a different dynamic now. I'd say NTA here because she kind of attacked your character in her frustration. If she had just expressed that she's feeling overwhelmed and needs help, I'd say N A H if she had respected your boundaries and accepted your suggestions after you declined.", "Idk about an asshole, but god you are heartless", "Well, you are selfish.

Unfortunately it does indeed seem like you\u2019ve never developed empathy and compassion for people that it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable (without further information) to think you would perhaps love. It comes across as completely detached as if you\u2019re talking about your neighbours across the street rather than you\u2019re family members. Without knowing that dynamic it does seem that you don\u2019t care about them at all. \n\nYes your sister took on the responsibility it was her decision and she has no right to pressure you into doing something you don\u2019t want to do. However families in my experience do their best to support one another even if we make decisions that someone else disagrees with. I can understand the stress of being a single mum with responsibilities that she/I took on, that sometimes feel like the hardest things ever. And in my case I reach out to my family or close friends for support.

He\u2019s family, I didn\u2019t expect to be a sister at 20 and we didn\u2019t know he had Down syndrome until he was born. \n\nBut he\u2019s family and he\u2019s a wonderful little guy and the idea of giving him to the state makes me sick. The state doesn\u2019t take good care of disabled people, they\u2019re better off in a nice group home or with family. \n\nIt\u2019s not a burden or a sacrifice to me, and I certainly didn\u2019t get PTSD from having a special needs sibling even if he did head butt me occasionally and yells a lot.", " Being around the disabled sister or your twin?

I could only be so callous if I didn't love my twin sister at all.  I mean, the OP doesn't say if she ever helps sis out with her own obligations (babysitting, etc.) but that could be a way to help out without being involved with the sibling.   \n\nI totally get why the OP doesn't want to be sucked into responsibilities she didn't create.  But I gotta wonder if OP has ever thought about who would take care of *her* if she were in need of assistance.

No one else in the family is concerned about what he's put me through because of what he's put them through. Which I understand, he is an absolute nightmare to deal with and I by no means prioritize my own issues with him above anyone else's. It's just frustrating because we're all basically his captives and there's no real end in sight. People have a tendency to think all people with downs are super sweet and nice, so when you express frustration or anger regarding their behavior you're looked at like some kind of monster.

It doesn't make her an asshole, but it IS absolutely her fault for ignoring her sisters warnings. Sometimes an I told you so is justified, and when a person is trying to force someone to help them with a problem that very person warned them not to take on? That's a pretty fair time to say I told you so.

Being a guardian is a lot of work and responsibility. And even if they sign over guardianship they can still visit and make sure the sister is being treated well. OP just doesn't want to do so much and was clear about that. There's nothing wrong with saying it's too much or even that they just don't want to. If the sister was being neglected and OP did nothing it'd be different but honestly being a guardian is stressful.\n\nHere's an example of something that can cause issues: medical stuff. Somehow a guardian has to decide whether the doctor is making reasonable choices or is over medicating or ignoring issues. At one of my care homes a guardian decided his aunt was being over medicated and had most of her prescriptions stopped. In this case he was wrong and she started acting out because her anxiety was so bad. But she wasn't very verbal (would say a few words but that's it) so couldn't vocalize what was wrong. But he was worried about possible medical abuse where a doctor would say there were issues just to charge the insurance and get more money. He was never around long enough to realize her increased activity was a bad thing and due to anxiety rather than \"being more alive.\" That takes more than an hour or two here and there when someone can't tell you something is wrong. \n\nHow eager would you be for that responsibility over someone you don't live with?

It's draining, it's causing cracks in relationships with siblings because all are involved in the decision making. Relatives are becoming concerned because they can see the cracks starting to appear. It's locked us in to caring for those needing the care (two people). One person no longer has a life and is no longer living with his wife and child because the people requiring care are in a different state and his family can't move. Another can't become too involved due to their own health that will become worse if they do take on too much responsibility. It's a sucky situation. Two of them aren't will to discuss the end game because one of those in care will pass before the other. The one remaining will have many years left but cannot care for themselves. Two of the carer's refuse to consider aged care facilities.
