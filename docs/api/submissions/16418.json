Why is her care so intensive for a guardian? What happens if your twin cannot manage all the tasks?\n\nWhat do you think is a good alternative to the situation that still provides ND sister with adequate care?", "What would have happened to your disabled sister if neither of you took on Guardianship?", "ESH.\n\nIn some ways, this post feels designed to hit at Reddit's buttons- being expected to care for someone against your wishes, being told your life is easy because you are childfree, etc.  This is a subreddit where people have said it was a-okay to send a niece or nephew into foster care, of course they are going to tell you that you don't owe your disabled sibling anything.\n\nYou don't owe it to your siblings or your dead parents to take over the guardianship, but some compassion wouldn't kill you.  \n\nA single mom of three kids under 10 is feeling overwhelmed and tried to get you to share responsibility for your disabled sibling.  Your response was \"I don't want to be a dick and say \"I told you so\" but that I warned her this would happen.\"  That is very literally an I told you so and it is a response that lacks compassion for someone who seems to be working very hard to take care of other people.\n\nYou seem to have a lot of anger towards your family, maybe you felt burdened by your sister growing up.  You have the right to set boundaries, but the level of anger and the \"I told you so\" energy isn't setting boundaries, it is being unkind.  Your sister didn't probably choose this responsibility because she wants to be a martyr, she chose this responsibility out of concern for your other sister and out of respect for your parents' wishes.  You should be able to respect that even if it isn't the choice you would make for yourself.  \n\nI am curious if you are involved at all with your disabled sister.  One of the reasons people don't sign custody over to the state is fear that the disabled person may suffer without a family advocate.  There may be options for you to take some of the burden off of your caretaking sibling without taking on legal guardianship, but I have a feeling you are not willing to do that.\n\nI also wonder if you have ever sought out therapy to discuss your feelings for your family.  The amount of anger and derision here makes me think you might benefit from therapy, regardless of your involvement in the current situation.", "NTA\n\nShe asked, and you answered. Not only that, you told her what the answer would be. \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to look after your sister- instead, they relied on their other children to take care of her as their plan.  This is never a good plan.\n\nIt\u2019s not children\u2019s job to pick up the slack. \n\nWhile I do feel for your twin sister, caregiving, burnout is really easy to get, she didn\u2019t heed advice given.\n\nBut really, your parents are the biggest AH in this story.", "You were very clear that you can't handle that level of responsibility and gave your reasons why. She didn't listen, took on the load, and now expects you to drop everything and replace her as the main guardian. That's not fair. I get loving your ND sister and wanting the best for her, but not if it's detrimental to your own life or mental health if there's other options. Your parents did it because that's their child. It's a different dynamic now. I'd say NTA here because she kind of attacked your character in her frustration. If she had just expressed that she's feeling overwhelmed and needs help, I'd say N A H if she had respected your boundaries and accepted your suggestions after you declined.", "Idk about an asshole, but god you are heartless", "Well, you are selfish.

If they choose to relinquish guardianship, those decisions probably get handled by a third party/the state who doesn't know the sister, can't interpret her needs as well as a family member and the care factor is likely lower, given that they might have hundreds of people they provide the service for.\n\nBetween two sisters, it's not some impossible task...it's probably a lot for one sister with 3 young kids, sure. She reached out for help and got met with 'I told you so, tough sh*t' because OP doesn't understand the familial obligation her sister feels...it's an alien concept to her.

You did let your twin sister know what your answer would be in regards to guardianship, but do you even have a relationship with this third sister? Yes, having a high-needs family member is incredibly difficult, but do you ever visit? (I apologize if I seem judge-y here; tone is incredibly difficult to get across on the internet. I had an uncle with special needs that I visited often as a kid, so this is supposed to be a question out of sympathy and concern. He was also non-verbal. My question mainly stems from this: out of his three sisters, only one visited with any regularity, so he really only had a relationship with her. My aunts had the means and the closer distance than my mother to visit him, but they never really did, and at the funeral they really seemed to regret it.)\n\nYour sister has no right to dictate your life, but you are being a d*ck (your words), with all of your \"I warned you that this would happen\" comments. You can at least make a compromise to help your sister. Being part of society, being part of a family, means giving and not just receiving. And, seriously, make a COMPROMISE--set your boundaries by all means and make them abundantly clear so that you're not drained by being a co-guardian!! But don't make it seem like there's absolutely nothing you can do. Maybe just be willing to sacrifice a tiny bit of your time? I promise that giving up your guardianship rights to the state is a lose-lose scenario.\n\n(Again, I apologize if my tone comes across wrong here. I would say this is a NAH or ESH situation. It just kind of sucks all-around for everybody when a family member can't communicate/take care of themselves the way the rest of us can.)", "I feel that many people don\u2019t understand the role of Guardianship on here. People in the system know that it can be a full time role and is very onerous on time and emotional labour, I\u2019m not surprised the sister is feeling overwhelmed by it all. \n\nHaving a guardian essentially ensures someone doesn\u2019t get left at bottom of the pile and ignored by an overwhelmed system. \n\nOP isn\u2019t an AH for choosing not to have their life infringed and led by these matters and the sister isn\u2019t an AH for wanting help and feeling resentful about finding this load difficult the take alone. \n\nI\u2019d recommend talking to the social worker, be open about the difficulties and exploring alternative options. Is there any aspect of it that you would be happy to take on OP i.e therapeutic side? Could you afford to club together and pay for a private guardianship?
