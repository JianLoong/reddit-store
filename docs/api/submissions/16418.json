Your response was \"I don't want to be a dick and say \"I told you so\" but that I warned her this would happen.\"  That is very literally an I told you so and it is a response that lacks compassion for someone who seems to be working very hard to take care of other people.\n\nYou seem to have a lot of anger towards your family, maybe you felt burdened by your sister growing up.  You have the right to set boundaries, but the level of anger and the \"I told you so\" energy isn't setting boundaries, it is being unkind.  Your sister didn't probably choose this responsibility because she wants to be a martyr, she chose this responsibility out of concern for your other sister and out of respect for your parents' wishes.  You should be able to respect that even if it isn't the choice you would make for yourself.  \n\nI am curious if you are involved at all with your disabled sister.  One of the reasons people don't sign custody over to the state is fear that the disabled person may suffer without a family advocate.  There may be options for you to take some of the burden off of your caretaking sibling without taking on legal guardianship, but I have a feeling you are not willing to do that.\n\nI also wonder if you have ever sought out therapy to discuss your feelings for your family.  The amount of anger and derision here makes me think you might benefit from therapy, regardless of your involvement in the current situation.", "NTA\n\nShe asked, and you answered. Not only that, you told her what the answer would be. \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to look after your sister- instead, they relied on their other children to take care of her as their plan.  This is never a good plan.\n\nIt\u2019s not children\u2019s job to pick up the slack. \n\nWhile I do feel for your twin sister, caregiving, burnout is really easy to get, she didn\u2019t heed advice given.\n\nBut really, your parents are the biggest AH in this story.", "You were very clear that you can't handle that level of responsibility and gave your reasons why. She didn't listen, took on the load, and now expects you to drop everything and replace her as the main guardian. That's not fair. I get loving your ND sister and wanting the best for her, but not if it's detrimental to your own life or mental health if there's other options. Your parents did it because that's their child. It's a different dynamic now. I'd say NTA here because she kind of attacked your character in her frustration. If she had just expressed that she's feeling overwhelmed and needs help, I'd say N A H if she had respected your boundaries and accepted your suggestions after you declined.", "Idk about an asshole, but god you are heartless", "Well, you are selfish.

You did let your twin sister know what your answer would be in regards to guardianship, but do you even have a relationship with this third sister? Yes, having a high-needs family member is incredibly difficult, but do you ever visit? (I apologize if I seem judge-y here; tone is incredibly difficult to get across on the internet. I had an uncle with special needs that I visited often as a kid, so this is supposed to be a question out of sympathy and concern. He was also non-verbal. My question mainly stems from this: out of his three sisters, only one visited with any regularity, so he really only had a relationship with her. My aunts had the means and the closer distance than my mother to visit him, but they never really did, and at the funeral they really seemed to regret it.)\n\nYour sister has no right to dictate your life, but you are being a d*ck (your words), with all of your \"I warned you that this would happen\" comments. You can at least make a compromise to help your sister. Being part of society, being part of a family, means giving and not just receiving. And, seriously, make a COMPROMISE--set your boundaries by all means and make them abundantly clear so that you're not drained by being a co-guardian!! But don't make it seem like there's absolutely nothing you can do. Maybe just be willing to sacrifice a tiny bit of your time? I promise that giving up your guardianship rights to the state is a lose-lose scenario.\n\n(Again, I apologize if my tone comes across wrong here. I would say this is a NAH or ESH situation.

People in the system know that it can be a full time role and is very onerous on time and emotional labour, I\u2019m not surprised the sister is feeling overwhelmed by it all. \n\nHaving a guardian essentially ensures someone doesn\u2019t get left at bottom of the pile and ignored by an overwhelmed system. \n\nOP isn\u2019t an AH for choosing not to have their life infringed and led by these matters and the sister isn\u2019t an AH for wanting help and feeling resentful about finding this load difficult the take alone. \n\nI\u2019d recommend talking to the social worker, be open about the difficulties and exploring alternative options. Is there any aspect of it that you would be happy to take on OP i.e therapeutic side? Could you afford to club together and pay for a private guardianship?

She knew, she just hoped she could guilt you into taking on being co-guardians", "I completely agree with elindoedash 1000%\n\nESH\n\nAs a person who has been manipulated it feels like the post is designed to manipulate reactions rather than actual ask for help, and in that way YTA\n\nSo of course it\u2019s your life and your boundaries and you\u2019re entitled to those. Unfortunately it does indeed seem like you\u2019ve never developed empathy and compassion for people that it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable (without further information) to think you would perhaps love. It comes across as completely detached as if you\u2019re talking about your neighbours across the street rather than you\u2019re family members. Without knowing that dynamic it does seem that you don\u2019t care about them at all. \n\nYes your sister took on the responsibility it was her decision and she has no right to pressure you into doing something you don\u2019t want to do. However families in my experience do their best to support one another even if we make decisions that someone else disagrees with. I can understand the stress of being a single mum with responsibilities that she/I took on, that sometimes feel like the hardest things ever. And in my case I reach out to my family or close friends for support. And I hope not to be met with judgement, I\u2019m fairly confident that I would be told what they thought of the situation but would also be there and support me in the way they are able to, just like I would do for them. \n\nSo I agree with elinordash, that perhaps therapy would be the best place to work though what ever has contributed to your disconnect from your family. I know that not every family is healthy, probably very few really, although I hope that\u2019s changing. And I know there are abusive, entitled, nasty people who do awful things to family members. So I truly hope you haven\u2019t suffered anything seriously awfully abusive, but I do think you really need to consider engaging professional help.", "I'm not asking to \"receive\" anything from my family but okay", "Neuro typical/ neuro divergent", "As per another comment, we both got inheritance but she got a larger one for doing the job and I have zero issue with that, I agree she should get larger share for doing the job. \n\nBut really why does it matter if we got an inheritance or not? So many people get inheritances from deceased parents everyday without such a huge responsibility and aren't called assholes\n\nI told my parents they can write me out of the will if their love for me is conditional upon being a guardian, but they gave me something anyway. \n\nBut FWIW I'm using my inheritance money to pay for the therapy and medications and service dog that I need for my PTSD growing up in this environment", "YTA you are not legally wrong blah blah blah, but you\u2019re definitely being an AH to both of your sisters", "Damn. That is a similar story. Wonder if someone\u2019s out there, minutely changing genders and ages to see what the different judgments are. If that\u2019s the case, OP, I\u2019d love to see the collected data.", "It's way more involved than that. Other than emergencies (by which I mean being taken to the ER) the guardian has to sign off on medical care, medications, spending for things like clothes and such that the home doesn't provide, making sure proper care without any abuse is being received, making sure the home is being paid on time, keeping insurance/disability going by staying on top of the paperwork, and that's just what I know from my time working in care homes! I didn't deal with the guardians or paperwork, just heard complaints from my manager when a guardian missed any of those things or chose to interfere. And missing stuff could mean the person doesn't receive care, loses their place in a home, and will get the guardian investigated and possibly blamed for anything that goes wrong!", "*But really why does it matter if we got an inheritance or not?*\n\nThe reason I was asking was because I was thinking of this in a context of working extra and overtime pay. My brother works a job where he gets overtime and it is double pay after 10 hours in one day or 40 hours per week. If your sister was getting compensated for her extra work, then this is relevant information. \n\nI saw a post recently about something similar to your situation except that there were four children, one of whom was mentally disabled and the parents were still alive but were making plans if something happened to them. The daughter gave her parents and two brothers three options with respect to caring for her sister long term after her parents were gone. 1. She gets all the inheritance and becomes a caregiver for her sister. 2. She gets no inheritance and brothers assume all responsibility for sister. 3. Entire inheritance gets put into a trust for disabled sisters care. Brothers were not happy as they wanted an inheritance and no responsibility of care. \n\nIf your sister got a larger inheritance in return for advocating for you sister then you are NTA.", "Well, if OP has c-ptsd from their, that means there is more to the story. Look, I get that OP's sister need care, and it was not her fault but to be able to care for someone that has a high needs, you need to be in a mentally stable place. And as some people have already pointed out, OP needs therapy to let go of allot of anger and maybe resentment. Yes, their sister didn't choose this, but OP should not be forced to do something at the cost of their mental health. \n(sorry if the grammar is bad, english is not my first language)", "I understand not wanting to be responsible for a sibling but... \"Making sure proper care with no abuse is being received\"\n\nIt's like the possibility of abuse is built in in her situation, and a related, able bodied, financially stable person just doesn't care enough to be involved in their care to prevent that from happening. I can't say that doesn't make op an AH.", "OP IS caring...for *herself*. She's not obligated to martyr herself for a person she neither made nor took responsibility for. If you're so generous and warm hearted, why don't you volunteer to take over?", "Why is everyone assuming I'm not in therapy? I am in therapy and will prob need that and medication for the rest of my life. I am also in line for a service dog for my PTSD\n\nMy twin (and parents when they were alive) just say (with regards to my PTSD) that I just need to \"suck it up and do it anyway.\" Bc what happens to disabled sister will be worse than my \"trauma\") that they have constantly minimized.", "Why would I volunteer to take over guardianship for an unrelated person in a different country?\n\nNow, if you asked me if I'd do the same for my relative...I currently do infinitely more than the OP would ever have to do as a 50% guardian. There's no comparison. I wouldn't say something I had zero experience with.\n\nTo me, she's selfish. Take that as you will. You may have a different interpretation of the word or apply it to different contexts...who knows.", "You should really mention the CPTSD and you going to therapy in the post. It might make people see a different side.", "OP is allowed to be selfish. Why does having shared genetic material obligate OP to sacrifice her time for a burdensome situstion she doesn't want and didn't create? Your idea that OP must do XYZ based simply on relatedness is tenuous, as she's literally neither her sister's parent or guardian."]}
