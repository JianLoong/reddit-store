I don\u2019t drive, so I can\u2019t go anywhere on my break and there\u2019s nowhere around that I can go chill. I sit in the lounge with noise cancelling earbuds. Most colleagues see that and take it as a sign, unless there\u2019s a fire or someone\u2019s dying, leave me alone.\n\nEDIT: It is not possible for me to go in my classroom as my kids are still there. It is 90+ degrees outside. There are no other rooms that don\u2019t have kids. This is the only place I can go. \n\nHowever, there\u2019s one colleague, Sandra (50s) who just cannot take the hint. She\u2019ll tap me on the shoulder to talk about little things or gossip, sometimes show me pictures of her family or cat. I did eventually tell her \u201chey, I appreciate need this time to decompress, so unless it\u2019s urgent, please leave me alone\u201d. She said okay.\n\nShe got a little better, but recently started up again. I tried to remind her but she just sort of brushed me off. \n\nYesterday was especially rough.

I also began scrolling through a social media.\n\nTap tap tap.\n\nI look up and Sandra\u2019s asking me about my day, which is clearly just a way for her to talk about herself. I politely smile and say I\u2019m not available to talk right now. I go back to my own thing.

At this point, I\u2019m unsure what it matters as I am also ND. So, I guess it\u2019s a debate of: whose needs come first? Hers to talk non-stop or mine for needing some time to decompress. That\u2019s even if she\u2019s nuerodivergent, which again, I have no way of knowing and isn\u2019t my business. \n\nSome feel I am wrong for how I handled it.

I blew up about your family, and they are not the issue.  The issue is YOU.  You have ignored what I've been telling you.  You, frankly,  are nagging me with your tap, tap, tapping on my shoulder.  You are violating my boundaries. So, if you are unable to contain yourself, I want you to know I'll be ignoring your taps.  Just an FYI to you.\nThat's the gist of it.

I absolutely understand your need for space and just to have that 20 minutes or so in peace, just to ground yourself. You deserve that, and people should respect that too.\n\nWhat I would say though, is your colleague although being very annoying and not respecting your boundaries...she was just trying to be nice, in her mind she might have saw you there looking sad etc by yourself and wanted to cheer you up or something, to try and involve you more. It might be an idea to just approach her and explain it isn't anything personal towards her and that you don't harbour any ill feelings towards her, and try to explain better why you feel that way, and why those periods are so important for you to just be left alone.\n\nOf course you're absolutely under no obligation to explain yourself or do anything, so if you don't feel comfortable doing so, then don't.

Yes, you reacted in not the best way but you were pushed, which isn\u2019t okay either. \n\nWhat I have done in the past when someone has tried this with me is tell them very clearly \u201cthis is my downtime to decompress.
