I LOVE my students and truly enjoy what I do. However, I also have CPTSD and get overstimulated. I am in therapy for both mental and sensory.

I don\u2019t drive, so I can\u2019t go anywhere on my break and there\u2019s nowhere around that I can go chill. I sit in the lounge with noise cancelling earbuds. Most colleagues see that and take it as a sign, unless there\u2019s a fire or someone\u2019s dying, leave me alone.\n\nEDIT: It is not possible for me to go in my classroom as my kids are still there. It is 90+ degrees outside. There are no other rooms that don\u2019t have kids. This is the only place I can go. \n\nHowever, there\u2019s one colleague, Sandra (50s) who just cannot take the hint. She\u2019ll tap me on the shoulder to talk about little things or gossip, sometimes show me pictures of her family or cat. I did eventually tell her \u201chey, I appreciate need this time to decompress, so unless it\u2019s urgent, please leave me alone\u201d. She said okay.\n\nShe got a little better, but recently started up again. I tried to remind her but she just sort of brushed me off. \n\nYesterday was especially rough.

I also began scrolling through a social media.\n\nTap tap tap.\n\nI look up and Sandra\u2019s asking me about my day, which is clearly just a way for her to talk about herself. I politely smile and say I\u2019m not available to talk right now. I go back to my own thing. Five minutes later.\n\nTap tap tap. \n\nI ripped out my bud and asked \u201cwhat?!\u201d She said \u201cI want to show you pictures of my granddaughter\u201d.

A few people in the lounge gave me a dirty look.\n\nI\u2019m sure some will ask: I don\u2019t know if she has autism or is nuerodivergent in another form. At this point, I\u2019m unsure what it matters as I am also ND. So, I guess it\u2019s a debate of: whose needs come first? Hers to talk non-stop or mine for needing some time to decompress. That\u2019s even if she\u2019s nuerodivergent, which again, I have no way of knowing and isn\u2019t my business. \n\nSome feel I am wrong for how I handled it.

I blew up about your family, and they are not the issue.  The issue is YOU.  You have ignored what I've been telling you.  You, frankly,  are nagging me with your tap, tap, tapping on my shoulder.  You are violating my boundaries. So, if you are unable to contain yourself, I want you to know I'll be ignoring your taps.  Just an FYI to you.\nThat's the gist of it.

I absolutely understand your need for space and just to have that 20 minutes or so in peace, just to ground yourself. You deserve that, and people should respect that too.\n\nWhat I would say though, is your colleague although being very annoying and not respecting your boundaries...she was just trying to be nice, in her mind she might have saw you there looking sad etc by yourself and wanted to cheer you up or something, to try and involve you more. It might be an idea to just approach her and explain it isn't anything personal towards her and that you don't harbour any ill feelings towards her, and try to explain better why you feel that way, and why those periods are so important for you to just be left alone.\n\nOf course you're absolutely under no obligation to explain yourself or do anything, so if you don't feel comfortable doing so, then don't.

Yes, you reacted in not the best way but you were pushed, which isn\u2019t okay either. \n\nWhat I have done in the past when someone has tried this with me is tell them very clearly \u201cthis is my downtime to decompress.

I am like OP - neurodivergent and I need my break time to decompress. I also get super overstimulated (I am a nurse and I love my job.

I literally seek out dark, empty spaces to take my break in. \n\nOP, you are NTA. You told her politely several times before you were less polite. You also have out easy to read context clues, like having your earbuds in and staring at your phone.

I'm confident I'll never meet a woman as boring and irritating as her in my life, when others snapped, she wouldn't even notice. She was like a puppy and not in a cute way. Everyone eventually learned to tune her out as we just presumed something undiagnosed or a developmental issue was at play, but the management never tried to find a way to stop her constant need to talk shit.

I can see why OP got fed up, and while snapping isn't ideal, coworker brought it on themselves. If there were people in the room to disapprove of that, they were available for coworker to talk to instead of bothering OP, who has made their *need* for time to not interact with coworker or anyone else for that hour clear on several occasions. \n\nOP, you are in no way the asshole here. There's no need to disclose your diagnosis or private info, but talking to someone above your coworker who can reign in her need to harass you on your downtime without doing so is certainly possible, and you should. Harassment is the way you should frame it as well. If you let them know this has been an ongoing issue that you have tried to handle on your own several times before escalating, and that of course this very reasonable request to be left to your personal needs on your personal time is something they should want to help with and you'd like them to work with you in finding a solution, any good employer will accommodate that and get coworker off your back.

If  I've got that wrong, then apologies and disregard this comment.\n\nI didn't want to say it initially, but I'm also someone that suffers with CPTSD, currently on medication and in therapy. The reason I mention this, is because I know what it's like to reach the end of your tether with someone, and you just say or do whatever you think will get said person to leave you alone.\n\nUsing wording like \"I don't care about your family, leave me alone\" would have certainly done the trick, and you mentioned several people overheard so I'm guessing it was said in a raised voice.
