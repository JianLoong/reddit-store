You're protecting your employee's privacy and mindful of her safety. Not disclosing this was the right call. Ultimately the customer has no right to know.", "NTA.  You are exactly right to preserve your employee\u2019s privacy and safety.  The fact that this customer reacted so irrationally to your answer is all the more reason to be careful.", "NTA. You already nailed it. It\u2019s against policy, and it\u2019s unsafe. There is not a universe where you could\u2019ve possibly been in the wrong here.", "NTA. Giving out employee schedules has gotten people killed. And the customer was acting weird.\n\nShe could have left a note for your employee. Or asked you to relay a message. Or waited until she saw the employee working again. But she didn't do that. \n\nHell, she didn't even a give a reason why she wanted to see the girl!

Her reaction was extreme, which raises questions about her motives. Always trust your gut reaction.", "NTA I find it admirable that you think about your employees safety. I will say if you own like a barbershop or something that makes some sense? Maybe I liked the way your employee cut my hair.

She was terrible at her job and rude to customers and coworkers. She ultimately got fired, but her son stayed and was often promoted. He was a model employee and the kindest person I ever met.

I haven't mentioned it yet but will when I come in next on a day she works", "Large companies wouldn\u2019t want you giving out the info, makes you a liability in worst case scenarios.
