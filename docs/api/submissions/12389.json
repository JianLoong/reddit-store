You're protecting your employee's privacy and mindful of her safety. Not disclosing this was the right call. Ultimately the customer has no right to know.", "NTA.  You are exactly right to preserve your employee\u2019s privacy and safety.  The fact that this customer reacted so irrationally to your answer is all the more reason to be careful.", "NTA. You already nailed it. It\u2019s against policy, and it\u2019s unsafe. There is not a universe where you could\u2019ve possibly been in the wrong here.", "NTA. Giving out employee schedules has gotten people killed. And the customer was acting weird.\n\nShe could have left a note for your employee. Or asked you to relay a message. Or waited until she saw the employee working again. But she didn't do that. \n\nHell, she didn't even a give a reason why she wanted to see the girl!

You're correct that it's a safety concern.", "NTA, you did the right thing.", "NTA. Too much information is already available to potential stalkers, no need to make it any easier for them.\n\nAnd you could tell her \"It's not a fireable offense at my business\"", "NTA. She's a liar or delusional.

I'll take estranged relative for $1000, Alex", "NTA.   She is wrong.  Large corporations will not tell customers what hours an employee works.\nBesides, you're the owner, and you set the privacy rules for your company.", "NTA. Her reaction was extreme, which raises questions about her motives. Always trust your gut reaction.", "NTA I find it admirable that you think about your employees safety. I will say if you own like a barbershop or something that makes some sense? Maybe I liked the way your employee cut my hair. But if you own I dunno a bar or some shit then you know the customer clearly wants to you know do something with said employee.
