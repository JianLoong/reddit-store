Now she did ask me once if i could drive the 7 hours to pick her up but then dropped it once I remembered and explained to her that I had an appointment the next day to patch a flat tire that I had gotten that day. 14 hours on a spare tire is not doable. She ended up staying the night and getting in early the next day. Everything was handled and went smoothly. She was stressed out from the situation but was not upset at me for not driving to pick her up. We had a great week. \n\nA week later, after she flies home she says she needs to have a talk with me. After her mom spoke with her, my gf told me that I did not behave like a man in the situation at the airport and should have gotten my tire fixed that day so i was prepared to drive 7 hours to pick her up. I pointed out the fact that if I were to have driven 7 hours, it would have almost been time for her to board for the morning flight.

NTA and she has a weird idea of what it means to be a man.", "NTA. No, you don't need to drive SEVEN HOURS to pick someone up when they have a hotel and a shuttle. She's a grown adult. Although this was an unfortunate situation, expecting you to come all that way to get her was completely unreasonable. Her family is sexist as hell and so is she.", "NTA and completely unrealistic. Perhaps she is looking for reasons to break up with you or at least cause a fight. The world does not revolve around her and the situation has nothing to do with being a \u201cman\u201d. Gendered BS from her mother\u2026", "Nta, I\u2019m guessing her Mom doesn\u2019t like you and used the opportunity to say negative things.  Any adult competent adult should be able to handle an overnight delay.  They usually shuttle you straight to the hotel and back.  This is aside from the fact that you driving 14 hours is nonsensical, much less on a spare.  I\u2019d also be concerned by the name calling: \u201cyou\u2019re a boy not a man.\u201d", "NTA that's a strange and illogical request, and a very outdated and toxic expectation of masculinity. Ah yes the ideal man, harassing people at their jobs instead of waiting for your appointment like a civilized human", "NTA.\n\nSexist nonsense aside, the thing that would worry me is that she allowed her mother's venom to change her thinking about you in a heartbeat.\n\nYour relationship is not as strong as her mother's influence, which doesn't bode well.", "NTA \n\nShe is an adult. \n\nThere is zero things unsafe with landing at an airport, getting a transfer to a hotel with a load of other passengers and staying the night then flying in the morning\n\nI would 1,000% prefer that than asking someone to drive 8 hours to get me. Then sitting in a car with them for 8 hours. \n\nThat\u2019s too much driving for one person. \n\nThe best option is sleep in a hotel and get on your flight the next day. \n\nThe cost of that is zero\n\nProbably got in at the same time\n\nThe cost of you driving is a lost nights sleep, 16 hours in a car, all that fuel costs plus you would be sore and tired when you got home", "NTA - You or both of you could have been in a terrible accident driving on a donut tire for 14 hours. Assuming you didn\u2019t break down on the side of the road on the way to get her. \n\nHer mom got in her ear about it. Maybe consider if you want to deal with such a MIL in the future. The name calling is also really juvenile.", "NTA\n\nWhat changed is her mom being an unrealistic psycho with unhealthy standards \n\nBe kind and let her know that this relationship can not continue if irrational expectations are constantly shifting \n\nYou didn't need to rush the tire because you had assumptions her flight would be ON TIME", "It is time to be a man and tell her that if she is demanding the unreasonable then she should consider finding another man to demand it from. Tell her to ask as many men as she can to see if she get a different answer from yours.    \n    \nYou can add that if she is ok with wasting your time and placing your life at risk by driving on a spare tire for 14 hours, she is not an acceptable companion to anyone with any self respect.\n    \nThis is a moment where you either cater to insanity or set a boundary. In either case it will govern the rest of your relation.", "NTA, she\u2019s disrespectful and you deserve better. She was fine with it until her mom put in her wrong, outdated two cents. You did nothing wrong and they both need to grow up.", "NTA, that is a completely unreasonable expectation considering she was provided with accommodations and what, she wanted to wait at the airport for 7 hours and then drive another 7? It was faster to just wait for the next flight. This type of things happen all the time when you travel and she\u2019s a grown ass woman, not a kid, so surely she can handle it. She shouldn\u2019t be calling you names either, that makes her an AH and you need to put your foot down at that kind of treatment or you\u2019re in for a fun relationship.", "NTA. This exact thing happened to me in Atlanta and I was 22 yo, a single young woman, and by the time I got to the motel it was midnight, pick up back to the airport was at 5AM. I was weirded and creeped out by the location, I hadn\u2019t eaten in 15 hours (which led me to beg the teenagers at BK - while ***standing*** in the drive-thru to take my money and that I\u2019d eat whatever - they wouldn\u2019t, but that\u2019s a different story.)\n\nAnyway, my point is that I can 100% relate to her experience. But you\u2019re absolutely right about everything you said. It literally made no sense time-wise, you couldn\u2019t have gotten there safely with your flat tire, and she was fine with it.\n\nWhat happened? I\u2019m guessing mommy and daddy made her feel bad for herself because she\u2019s their daughter and their \u201cprincess.\u201d Notice how all of their complaints and justifications for their - and consequently your gf\u2019s - argument are all about what you ***should have done prior to the flight being cancelled***? There\u2019s a reason for that. Because what you said and did were rational and reasonable in the situation. And even after you countered. your gf went straight to an ad hominem attack? That\u2019s called a logical fallacy and she\u2019s, I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s true, manipulating you.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Im not telling you to break up or anything but I also wouldn\u2019t forget the way she (and mommy and daddy!) handled it. You deserve to be treated fairly. Don\u2019t second guess yourself here. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA but your gf sure is a trip. \u201cthat\u2019s what a man does?\u201d How about \u201cthat\u2019s what a grown woman does\u201d\u2026manages her own travel. \n\nIt\u2019s completely normal and reasonable for an airline to provide lodging and a next day flight. Happens all the time. You know what else? Plenty of young women her age put their big girl pants in and travel solo and do just fine. \n\nQuestion is, do you really want to be responsible for her happiness if she can\u2019t be mature enough to regulate it herself?", "NTA Please see below\n\n>After her mom spoke with her\n\n>gf told me that I did not behave like a man \n\n> should have gotten my tire fixed that day\n\n>\u201cit doesnt matter that\u2019s what a man does\n\n>don\u2019t be a smart ass\n\n>She also called me a little boy", "NTA. It\u2019s her parents dude. They are feeding her these comments and she is passing it on. No way you drive 14 hrs round trip", "NTA!  The safety, the expenses, the time...all of which has been covered but on top of that I don't think she's really considered 1) what she would have done while waiting for 7-8 hours at the airport for you to arrive and 2) how she'd feel after waiting those 7-8 hours in the airport to then sit in your car for another 7-8 hours!  OMG that alone sounds like hell on earth.   \n\nHer parents would have preferred she sat around an airport all that time instead of being in a safe, comfortable hotel room?   Get bent!\n\nEdited to add: a REAL man would take his daughter's safety and comfort above perceived dog-whistles of masculinity bullshit.", "NTA. Not sure you speed limit on your spare but unless it's a full size which it doesn't seem to be, that's just not reasonable to expect and it's not safe. What's the point in getting there right when she would have boarded anyways? Being overly chivalrous is actually condescending and the mom seems to be having some influence here over something she wasn't worked up over to being with.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you have to be prepared to drive 7 hours to pick her up?  How can a rational person expect you to somehow know her flight would get cancelled?  It's not like she was stranded, the airline was paying for the hotel and shuttle.\n\nNothing changed in a week. Sounds like her mom filled her up with a bunch of selfish ideas and she seems very open to them.  If she really had an issue she should have told you right then not a week later. That's just petty and assholey. \n\nIMO calling you \"a little boy\" it's a bit emasculating and completely unnecessary. \n\nHer mom is the asshole. She's just easily manipulated.", "NTA. Driving 14 hours in winter would have been an absurd waste of time and effort (and impossible on a spare). She got a shuttle to a hotel and back, wasn't mad at you, and her mom needs to sit the heck down and stop causing trouble.", "Absolutely NTA. You behaved like a logical adult. She is now behaving like an illogical child.", "NTA. Sounds like her mom is a bad influence with some toxic ideas about masculinity.", "NTA  \n\n\nIf it was a relationship I wanted to stay in I would tell my gf I hear she was upset after the fact, but I feel I did the safe and reasonable thing all around, and that I expected an apology for the way they spoke to me, and misandry in gender roles and name calling is not OK.  If she's going to double down on her statements it's not looking like a relationship that will make you happy in the long run.  \n\n\nI hope somebody would slap sense into me if I asked a partner to drive all night, us both being sleep deprived on the way home, neither of us really being safe to drive and everybody suffering for no good reason", "NTA.

It isn't as though air traffic was grounded and she didn't have another option. Her car hadn't broken down in the middle of nowhere. She wasn't in the midst of a medical emergency. Those would have been reasons that you might choose to drive seven hours to pick her up. I'm a woman who's traveled alone since her teens, I've slept on the floor of airports when my flight was grounded due to weather, reached out to relatives when my flight was oversold and I couldn't reach my parents (minor traveling alone before the age of cell phones), figured out how to get where I needed without needing a partner or parent to pick me up. Having a room and a hotel shuttle is about the least stressful way to deal with a flight issue. She's an adult and she can figure it out, and it sounds like she did.", "NTA. Leave her. She's not worth another moment, let alone 7 hours. If she knows \"what a man is\", she should go find someone who meets her definition of one.", "NTA and OP, please let your gf know that next time she chooses to fly that she really needs to make sure that her mom has her accompanied throughout the entire check-in process, board the plane, and then as soon as you get there to pick her up, that the airlines can release her to you (obviously with the proper identification).  If she expects you to treat her like a child and pick her up to avoid the big scary hotel and airport shuttle she had to endure alone, then she might as well be treated like one.\n\nIt sounds flippant, but the question is the fact that her mother has likely been putting in her head as far as what a \"man\" is supposed to be and do you really want to put up with it?", "No your NTA, but women are always gauging to see what their man is willing to do for them. All that said, you failed the test. Yeah yeah yeah, its the 21st century equal rights and all that, but some women want a man that will bend the world for them. Some men want a woman that will make them their world. You give and you take bud.\n\nAccept you lost this battle, determine if the war is worth fighting for.", "Your gf sounds like a real treat.\n\nA 14 hour round trip is not reasonable, even without the spare tyre issue.\n\nShe sounds ghastly.\n\nNTA.", "This sounds like one of those situations where you have to address the feelings, not the reality, because your GF is operating entirely on feelings and free of logic, and so is her main source of validation, her mother. There's no point in arguing logic with people when they're trying to justify their feelings.\n\nShe had to stay in a hotel, and felt lonely, and frustrated, and maybe a bit scared, and like her plans had all gone horribly wrong. She wanted you to swoop in and save her on a charging white horse, and you didn't. The fact that your white horse had a flat tire and wouldn't have got there more than two hours before her flight doesn't matter. She just feels like you failed her in her hour of need, and her mother clearly agrees. \n\nBasically, the ball is now in your court: either you're into this woman enough that you will put up with this kind of entirely reality-free feelings-based interaction, or you aren't. If you are, then you better start stocking up on chocolate hearts for her pillow and boom boxes playing Peter Gabriel and driving all night to bring her her favourite book she forgot. If not, then just apologise that you couldn't make it happen for her and move on. NTA.", "NTA! Run! Her version of being a man is to do back flips and cartwheels and to overall be inconvenienced. Someone who cares about you would NEVER expect you to do that.", "NTA, if she cares about you, she wouldn't want you to needlessly drive 7 hours. You gender has no bearing, I guess it's okay for you to be seriously inconvenienced because you're a man? I had a flight get cancelled when I was 20, flying home from college. I found a nearby hotel, called the airline to get on the next flight and patted myself on the back for being resourceful. She is an adult she should be able to handle a situation like this.", "NTA", "NTA. This is absolutely ridiculous. Sounds like the mother is the one having issues with this as you said gf was fine with it. The mother's comments are absolutely unnecessary and uncalled for. You need to have a chat with your gf on how ridiculous this is. If your gf sides with mum, you got to call it quits because mum's words is ridiculous I can't even explain it.", "She is a grown up.  She could have hired a car and driven the 7 hours.  Or like any sensible person, just sucked it up and stayed in the hotel.  NTA", "NTA. Does her mother always have her ear? Impact her decisions and opinions? I'd be very wary if so. Reddit is very familiar with a momma's boy trope, and the red flags it brings - be similarly wary even though she's a girl. Will her mother's opinions always be imposed on your relationship? If you marry? If you have kids?

The important part is that your GF doesn't respect you as a human being, and should no longer be your GF.\n\nI mean, I'd argue that anybody unable to deal with a flight delay, staying in a provided hotel room, and boarding a shuttle isn't mature or competent enough to be travelling solo, but that's just me.", "NTA\n\nAnd you need to rethink your relationship with this person.

At first you were all set to go get her because you were \u201cworried for her since she was a woman alone in an unknown area and these situations can be stressful.\u201d Please. These situations are stressful for everyone and it wasn\u2019t like she was being asked to walk alone down a dark alley. Believe it or not, plenty of women traveling alone deal with this and worse every day without batting an eyelash. \n\nWhy does everyone in this woman\u2019s life think she\u2019s incapable of taking care of herself?

Oh the horror.", "Your gf is an entitled brat. NTA - dump her ass", "A real man would break up with this psycho. NTA.", "NTA, especially since it worked out pretty smoothly. If it was like 30 minutes away, I understand, but it sounds like you were acting normally. Unless there's something I'm missing, she is out of line, and acting childish.", "NTA.

If she\u2019s going to be like that, then maybe you should consider getting out of your relationship.", "NTA, but she is her mommy's little puppet. Question: Is her dad i the picture? Because it sounds like Mom & Dad parted and mom may have a very skewed view of what men do. Men don't inflict emotional trauma on their girlfriend's by trying to unnecessarily flex their bravado for a problem that is in the process of being solved. What if you died on the way there? Then sge would be living with the guilt of that forever. Ask yourself whether you want to be in a relationship with her and her mother.", "NTA idk why anyone expect you to drop everything for her when she said it was fine. Also definitely not very respectful of her to call you that and she went to her mom to gas herself up to then be rude to you... yikes.", "The fact that she allowed her mother's irrational input to change her mind is an indicator of the future you would have together. Time to let her go.", "She would have been faster with the plane than with the car. He drives 7 hours and probably need some stops on the way so make it 8 or even 9.. Then the same amount of time back. Maybe she can drive a bit but that is probably not what a man should ask of her, she\u2019d probably say\u2026 so in the 15 hours he is driving around she can take the plane multiple times and still beat the car\u2026 \n\nI also think it is ridiculous to ask your partner to drive that far when you have a hotel room. She still had to wait for her partner to drive there anyways. OP, she was not thinking of you. I wouldn\u2019t let my spouse drive that far when there is a safe option for both of us."]}
