This post concerns my daughters, Ella (16) and Olive (19). A few days ago Ella asked Olive to pick her up from school, take her to her friends house to pick up a couple things she left there, and take her home after class. Olive agreed. \n\nThe day Olive was supposed to pick Ella up, she called Ella and said she had to get gas, pick up some food for herself, go to the bank, do some shopping for MIL, then drop off whatever she was getting to MIL. She asked Ella to call their uncle (who doesn\u2019t like Ella) and ask him to take her. Then she called back and said my FIL got home early and can pick her up, all she had to do was call when she wanted to go. \n\nElla ended up never calling them and asked Olive to pick her up on the way back. Olive picked her up on her way to MIL\u2019s house and brought her to the house, 2 hours after she promised to pick Ella up. \n\nWhen they got inside, my MIL yelled at Ella for not calling my BIL or FIL to pick her up and for making Olive wait for her. Ella told my MIL that Olive agreed to do this, was 2 hours late, and didn\u2019t take her to her friends house but MIL yelled at her again because plans changed and Olive arranged for 2 other rides for her that wouldn\u2019t have been late and would\u2019ve taken her to her friends house. \n\nElla decided to wait in the car to avoid more verbal abuse and she assumed Olive would wrap it up but Olive left her in the car for another hour while she ate and talked to my MIL. \n\nElla told me what happened later that night. I called my MIL to tell her she had no right to speak to Ella the way she did. My MIL responded by telling me she wouldn\u2019t have to if I would and that somebody needs to punish Ella when she\u2019s being a brat. I told MIL that if she can\u2019t respect me and my kids I will no longer be running errands for her. \n\nMy MIL told my husband about this and they\u2019re all mad at me (they all favor Olive).

This whole thing is ridiculous. How does Ella usually get home? Why couldn\u2019t Olive pick Ella up and take her with her to run errands. Why couldn\u2019t she add what she had promised (taking Ella to get her stuff and then home) to her list of errands? Why can\u2019t MIL run her own errands? Why can\u2019t MIL be an adult and realize a child\u2019s transportation comes before her groceries? Why can\u2019t FIL go get the groceries? I have a dirty uncle. I understand not wanting to be around a certain uncle. Why didn\u2019t Ella call a parent to handle this situation? Why wasn\u2019t Olive remotely concerned about her sister\u2019s safety? Why is MIL allowed to blatantly favor one grandchild over another? Why are all these people so selfish and entitled? ESH", "What did I just read?", "What did I just read? Does this make sense to anyone?", "Info: What actually caused MIL to get upset? Olive picking up Ella on the way didn't change or effect anything from MIL's perspective?", "I have no idea why it escalated to this point. It sounds like you need to be more present with your teenage kids and everyone needs to take a step back and chill out. What a bunch of dumb drama", "ESH. Ella wanted a favor. Olive had to change her plans and suggested other people to do it. Ella chose not to ask them and waited on Olive (who I'm not entirely clear about whether she did or didn't do the full favor). Ella is 16, she can make her own choices about this. \n\nNeither MIL NOR YOU need to get involved!", "This is truly stupid.", "Nope .. seems like Ella likes to see chit start..", "YTA, so is your kid. Why the fuck did they wait two hours when they *knew* other folks could have picked her up? I wouldn't agree to shit after this.", "Let me see if I get this. Ella wanted Olive to pick her up. But olive had errands she had to do, as well as doing things for her Grandmother. She told Ella to call her uncle or grandfather.   But Ella decided not to because uncle doesn\u2019t like her, and she is embarrassed to be seen in grandpa\u2019s car. \n\nYou know Ella instigated some of this", "YTA", "You and Ella are YTA. She is 16, not 6. Sounds like you are enabling her dysfunctional behaviour. Plans change, it happens all the time, she needs to learn to adapt.", "Nta, olive made a commitment to pick her sister up. She then decided to run errands and have someone else to do it. She didn\u2019t even tell her with enough notice to make different arrangements.\n\nWhere were you and your partner?", "ESH. Olive - because she either should have tapped her promise, or, if the plans were changing, she should have been the one doing the asking - as in, she should have asked one of the other people to pick up Ella, not telling Ella to do it herself. \nElla - unless those two other family members are actually abusive to her, there was no good reason for her not to call them. \nYou - for not even bothering with Olive's point of view. From the way the post is written, one cannot even tell that Olives is actually your daughter. Do you even like her?\nEdit: forgot about MIL. Of course, she sucks too for yelling at Ella and for pitting sisters against each other.", "YTA - Olive did promise her sister but had a legitimate reason to break the promise because she was doing errands. She even offered replacement but Ella (golden Kid) didn't want any of that and Chose to wait 2 hours.

I'm just glad they're not my family.", "I thought the same thing. \ud83d\ude06", "That is a good question. I have no idea.

She didn\u2019t have a valid reason to cancel.", "My BIL doesn\u2019t like Ella, never has. My FIL has an old beat up car that embarrasses Ella and the car has a weird smell.", "What about Olive had plans with Ella and should have completed those plans before doing others?", "What do you mean by making Olive wait? How long did she have to wait for?", "Personally I think olive made a commitment and that should take precedence over anything other than an emergency. \n\nElla wasn\u2019t comfortable with the other arrangements so she waited for her sister to get her knowing she wouldn\u2019t go to her friends house. \n\nYour mil needs to learn that verbally abusing a teen over this was completely inappropriate and not her concern. \n\nI don\u2019t know if Ella is a difficult child or if she\u2019s treated unfairly to cause issues with her uncle. And the being embarrassed by the car kinda sounds spoiled. \n\nNot sure anyone comes off great here.", "I would upset too. Ella waited for 2 hours instead of taking other available options", "Also, If Ella was planning on going to a friends house after school, why not just ask the friend for a ride?", "Was it 2 hours after she said she would? Really?!\n\nBecause unless there's information missing, what I'm getting is that Olive told Ella that she couldn't make the original pickup and Ella told her that in that case she'd accept being picked up by Olive on her way home from your MIL after all the chores were done. Olive instead picked her up *on the way to Grandmother's place*, which means it was over an hour earlier than she otherwise would have been picked up.", "Okay, so Ella's choice meant she didn't get to do what she wanted. Those are the consequences of her choice not to call anyone else. She doesn't also need to be verbally harassed by MIL, or defended by you. Let her be her own person.", "Ella could have ridden a bus, or gone with the foot mobile if she wasn\u2019t happy with the situation.", "She had plenty", "She did have a valid reason. Her plans changed because she needed to run errands to help their relatives. She communicated that change in good time, and offered alternate plans that would get Ella where she wanted to be.", "So not only is Ella expecting everyone to change for her but she is also a snob when it comes to her grandfather\u2019s car ?  \nMIL should not have yelled but Ella wasn\u2019t innocent in this", "Doesn't matter. A ride is a ride. If she doesn't want to take what she can get she can get off her ass and walk.", "I don\u2019t know. 15-20 minutes?", "Ahead didn't expect everyone to change, she expected her sister to stick by what they agreed. Since when is it OK to blow people off for no valid reason? She could have helped Grandma after she gave her sister a lift", "That is hardly anything. I don't see any reason why they would be upset with her.\n\nHow was Ella with Olive picking her up 2 hours later originally planned? Was she fine with it or did she get upset. Was she complaining or texting Olive to hurry up, etc.", "I don\u2019t know", "Then YTA for yelling at your MIL without finding out all of the details around what happened. Ella may have deserved that lecture if she was acting like a brat.", "Mil not a parent and wasn\u2019t in charge of the kids. She doesn\u2019t have the right to lecture", "May be a cultural difference. I think Grandparents can 100% call out their grandchildren\u2019s poor behaviour, especially if their parents aren\u2019t around to do so.", "I think if it was done while the grandparents are in charge of them then yes. However this should have been given to parents. I doubt mil even listened to both sides."]}
