For someone who needs to lose weight, every day, at least 3 times a day, you have to be making decisions about your intake. That means you are constantly subjected to food choices and thinking about food. In case you do forget about it, there is a constant barrage in the media about food, all designed to tempt people into eating more.

Scarfing a high fat, high calorie meal in front of her while giving her some lettuce and a few random vegetables (cuz I doubt you made a substantial salad for her)? Really?!?\n\nMany people eat for emotional reasons. Eating can be comforting. If your dad laughs at her for her weight and you and your wife have so little care and respect for her, is it any wonder that she reaches for food to cope? I\u2019ve packed on about 20 pounds because I\u2019m the caregiver for my husband who had a stroke, has other health issues and related dementia. There are times when I get overwhelmed and overeat. Emotional eating is a thing. I suspect that is at least in part what your mom is doing.\n\nAre you, your wife, and dad at your ideal weight? How is your blood pressure? Cholesterol? Triglycerides? Blood sugar? If you don\u2019t know get your blood work done.

She makes her own choices with whatever she eats, regardless of weight, you aren\u2019t the boss of that. Go apologize to your mother for that cruel action.", "YTA- if you were truly concerned about her weight and eating habits why not serve a healthy lower calorie meal? A roast chicken, salad and carb substitute like mashed cauliflower with fresh fruit for dessert? Soup and salad?  Grilled salmon and vegetables?\n\nNo, instead you chose to single her out by basically saying we deserve these foods while you do not so we'll just eat in front of you.  Not only are you a Supreme AH  you're also cruel.", "YTA. All that's going to do is push her into emotional eating", "YTA. \nDid it ever cross your mind how humiliating it would be for her to just sit there while the rest of you continued eating?

I want to make her a meal, whatever her favorite thing is to eat.  My mom died a very skinny 55 year old, my grandmother was always obese and was otherwise healthy and lively until right before she died at 98.  I don't know what fat person hurt you, but I don't feel like it was your mom.  Maybe you need to discuss your fatphobia with a therapist.  This is your problem to work out, not your moms.  I don't think a tearful, heartfelt apology is enough but its a start.", "YTA holy shit. you humiliated her in front of your family and expected it to go well?? you don't get to decide when exactly to start her diet. she's an adult, so treat her like one and allow her to make her own choices. if you're concerned, you do it in a way that doesn't involve putting her on the spot like that.", "YTA.

What a cruel thing to do to your own mother. I would be so ashamed, how are you not? She is probably humiliated.", "YTA. So many questions.\n\nHow is it \"spoiling her with too much food\" to serve her the same portion as everyone else? In what world did you think that this wouldn't embarrass her?

For fucks sake, Salmon can be cooked deliciously, and remain really nutritious and healthy.\n\nYou just wanted to humilliate your mom.\n\nIf her comments about being so spoiled with food are really that annoying to you, have an actual adult conversation with her, make plans with her to actually help her, don't make unilateral decisions just to \"teach her a lesson\". Use your adult words to communicate, if you really are that concerned.\n\nI bet you don't even know the nutritional value of that little salad you served.

I agree with another commenter that she\u2019s trying to make herself feel better and take the blame off of her\u2026 but the blame IS hers, that\u2019s the thing.

I have PCOS, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m big. I choose to eat carb heavy foods for many of my meals. If I ate more meat and greens, I would be smaller, regardless of my PCOS.

Lol. Sorry. I\u2019m autistic too and opinionated xD \n\nI will go with NAH. She needs to take accountability.. or not, but she doesnt need to make it your problem. You could be nicer and maybe make healthier meals as a family, but you don\u2019t have to. I recommend talking this out with her and finding a solution. Seeing what she actually wants. Does she want help, does she want to not do anything? Make it clear she can\u2019t blame you for her choices.", "YTA. She didn't ask you to put her on a diet, one meal won't make a huge difference and also if she wanted to go on a diet she probably wouldn't just have salad, she would be better off with a smaller portion of each.

Seriously, did you even think about how she'd react? Was there some fantasy scenario where you single her out to get no more food at dinner, and she is grateful to you enacting weight control measures on her without talking to her about it first?\n\nIf you were actually trying to help her you'd have talked to her about it and bring up your concerns. This was done to rub her face in her excuse-making, like she's a bad dog or something.", "ESH. You did what she is always complaining about. Maybe she\u2019s upset because she was using everyone else as an excuse for her weight related issues instead of placing the blame on herself.

Your mother is still a human being that deserves empathy. If someone says they want to lose weight, figure out how to help them on their terms. All you\u2019ve done is exacerbate the situation while acting like an immature child. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there is not a single bit of credible literature out there that says you should help your elder lose weight by not feeding her the way you do everyone else. Was this idea based in genuinely wanting good for your mother? Or the intent to punish her for making you listen to her complain? \n\n\u201cWell, you complain about it all the time. I\u2019m here to help you do it.\u201d\n\nWow. Great. She\u2019ll stop complaining about it in front of you and probably stop eating in front of you too. GREAT job, OP. You chose one of the ONLY plans of action where literally everyone loses.", "YTA. \n\nJust tell her to stop pretending you\u2019re the reason she\u2019s fat. Honesty is what adults should choose, not passive-aggressiveness and humiliation. I hope you feel enough shame to not pull something like that ever again.", "YTA\n\nYou and your wife are horrible", "wow big big yikes. YTA", "of course YTA. i can't believe you even have to ask. everyone ganged up on her.", "Yta - and you\u2019re mean, you\u2019re a bully, and you\u2019re rude.", "Yta. This should have been discussed with her beforehand. She came expecting a meal and instead was embarrassed. I understand that you care about her health but ultimately, she is in charge of herself.", "YTA.  You humiliated her.  For what?  I would be pisssssed.  The fact that you are here defending your actions makes you the AH about 1000 times over.  What a terrible son.", "You know YTA. You could have done both courses at once and ask if she wanted to go heavier on the salad and less on the ribs but the conversation shouldn\u2019t have been at the table in front of everyone.", "oh my god??\nYTA \n\nI absolutely hate when people humiliate and dehumanize bigger people with little asshole-y stunts like this and justify it with \u201cI\u2019m worried about their health.\u201d\nYour mother is aware of her condition, she is aware of her health. It can be hard to deal with things like BED or food addiction or just the habit of eating large portions, and I\u2019m sure singling her out like this would not help in the slightest. There is a way to go about dealing with this, but this was not it.\nUgh.\nYou\u2019re a nasty nasty person with a nasty nasty wife.", "YTA,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should support her in losing weight, yes, but singling her out isn't the way to go!", "YTA. Was your mother awful to you growing up? Did she abuse you or neglect you? Because that is the only reason someone would have for treating their mother so horribly.", "YTA. OP, what exactly did you think you were going to accomplish with this stunt? Did you think you were actually going to kick start your mother into a lifestyle you consider healthier? Did you think this was a good way to support her on her health journey? Because as a middle-aged overweight woman, I can absolutely assure you did not. \n\nHere is what your little stunt actually accomplished: You embarrassed your mother in front of people she cares about. You made her health and appetite the butt of a bad joke. You showed her that she cannot be honest about her health or feelings with you. Your \"helpfulness\" was a mean prank I would expect from middle schoolers. \n\nLook, if your actual concern is your mother's health, then by all means, talk to her about her health. Weight is just one of the numbers on a patient's chart; there are many others that influence how a person feels and how healthy they are. Ask if her doctor has suggested any kind of diet and how you can help. \n\nBut no, that would take actual effort and the ability to have an adult conversation. So much easier and more entertaining to make jokes about the fatty.\n\nThose comments about being \"spoiled\" and needing to lose weight your mother makes? Our society conditions women to hate their bodies--no matter what we look like--which leads us to make excuses as way of apologizing about weight. We have to live our lives apologizing for being humans with appetites and committing the sin of taking up space in public. \n\nOh, and by the way: at the age of 63, there likely is a lot more at work here than just eating more veggies. Once women hit their 40s, our biology starts making it very hard to lose weight. Also, your mom may be like me and have a wrecked endocrine system that makes losing weight almost impossible without additional medical intrevention. \"Calories in, Calories Out\" only works in closed systems, which the human body is not. \n\nSend your mom an apology via flowers. Explain to her that you misunderstood her comments about food and her weight. Tell her you want to support her in living a life that is good for her and want her to be happy. \n\nThen, get off your high horse. You didn't mention your age, but rest assured if you are blessed with more years, your metabolism will crash, too.", "YTA. This wasn\u2019t about her health or for her well-being; you were sick of her deflecting responsibility for her weight and decided to teach her a lesson. You humiliated her in public so she would know how annoying you think she is. How could you possibly not be TA in this scenario?", "YTA\n\nThis belongs in some sort of defiant malicious compliance forum. You know you acted an ass\u2026. Or you are unbelievably socially inept. I\u2019ll let you pick.", "YTA. I can understanding wanting to jump start her diet, but not make a healthy low calorie meal for everyone? This way she isnt singled out and everyone is eating healthy?", "YTA there are other options.", "On what planet could you not be an AH doing something like this?

Might be a good long while before your mom returns your calls. Imagine craving power so badly that you need to withhold food from your MOTHER.", "You do realize that with your behavior, it only gets worse for your mother? Shaming her, even if she behaved like an ass, is absolutely gonna backfire! So if you really care, get her help or serve her smaller portions.\n\nYTA", "YTA. That\u2019s appalling. Honestly. The supportive thing to do, if you truly wanted to have salad would be for you all to have a meal that would have been \u2018healthy\u2019.

I don\u2019t know on what planet you would think it\u2019s ok to treat someone like that, particularly your mum.", "This is one of the most YTA posts I\u2019ve ever seen here. OP, wife, and dad are all TA. What a bunch of bullies. I wouldn\u2019t return your calls either.", "YTA YTA YTA. Someone else\u2019s food choices are NOT YOUR BUSINESS, ever, full stop. What you did was infantilizing and humiliating. All of you owe her an apology, and you need to educate yourself.", "You humiliated your mother. That's a real nice way to motivate someone and let them know you care about them.", "Could have served her a smaller portion, right? That's actually the best way to lose weight. Don't restrict variety of food, but focus on portion control. I get the point you wanted to make but you didn't really make that point very well.", "So you thought instead of having a private conversation to discuss how she might wish to try and lose weight, you\u2019d go full on no-main-course-for-you!\n\nIt\u2019s not as if you replaced her ribs with a healthy alternative. You just started her with a salad like everyone else and then didn\u2019t serve again but expected her to sit at a table and watch other people eat. \n\nI\u2019m going to tell you this as someone who has been obese. You know how embarrassed we feel on a daily basis? You don\u2019t think we want to lose weight? So many things revolve around food. And when you\u2019ve had an unhealthy relationship with food, it\u2019s hard to quit it. Or maybe you\u2019re doing really great but then it\u2019s night time and you\u2019re ravenous and you feel horrible after. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to embarrass your mom. She\u2019s probably embarrassed of herself enough as it is.\n\nYTA", "I'm going against the grain and saying NTA. Only because she keeps trying to blame you for her weight. \n\nShe fucked around and found out but now you need to have a conversation with her about the unfair blame.", "YTA. I think you posted this to brag about having humiliated your mother. I hope you're happy.", "YTA why the hell wouldn\u2019t you cook a healthy meal for **everyone** instead of singling her out and shaming her? \n\nShe clearly has issues surrounding food and by doing this will definitely compound them. You don\u2019t have to restrict yourself to salads to lose weight, alls you\u2019re doing is making food more of an issue than it already is. Why haven\u2019t you guys as a family started to take healthy living seriously? There was so many ways to help your mother but you guys chose one of the cruelest. Show her how to be healthy without making it a thing to be ashamed of, you all should be helping including your father who it seems has done nothing to help her over all the years. Instead of helping he has continued to enable bad eating habits then mocked her for it. If you had something that was clearly a long standing issue that caused deep emotional problems, would you respond to being humiliated and shamed or to encouragement and being lead by example? \nYou smugly blindsided and singled her out with a salad while everyone ate unhealthy tasty food in front of her and expected her to just shut up and take it? \n\n\nDo you not have any love for her or do you just think she deserves humiliation because she has weight issues?", "YTA that was just really mean. You were being a bully.", "You could have spoken to her beforehand, made clear your concerns, and treated her like an adult.\n\nThe fact that you served everyone salad, and then just left her out of the main course, is appalling.\n\nYTA, and a petty one at that.", "YTA. \n\nIf you really wanted to be more supportive, you could have talked to your Mom about this beforehand.\n\nSpringing a surprise as a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment will only be humiliating for her and make her less willing to get help.", "YTA \n\nAnd I want to add some information for general health reasons.\n\n1. A salad isn't very nutritious . You might get some vitamins. But you still need carbs, proteins and healthy fats. ~~Even if~~  Especially if you want to lose weight.\n2. Her body needs resources to maintain herself. \n3. There is a certain dynamic that makes feeling filled after a meal more difficult for people who are obese. I can't explain the dynamic well in proper terms, but basically their sense of being filled from food is disturbed. This adds to the issue of losing weight because it takes so much more effort to realize when you are actually full. And losing weight is much more about starting appropriate exercise and including healthy foods in their diet. and this diet should include carbs, proteins and healthy fats.\n\nSo you are a big asshole for embarrassing her in front of everyone.\n\nSuper ignorant and stupid to think that this was a smart move overall.", "YTA\n\nThat was soooo disrespectful and humiliating.\n\nA better solution would have been to have a conversation about her constant empty talk of trying to lose weight.\n\nYou could have made only enough food for each person to have one serving.\n\nYou could have made a healthy meal for everyone.\n\nIt takes more than a simple salad for it to be filling. Do a bit of research on dietary needs and nutrition if you're really interested in helping your mother instead of insulting her.", "Hands down, YTA", "Tell me you know nothing about weight loss without telling me. A salad can be just as bad or worse with dressing and toppings. It\u2019s sounds like the mother needs portion control and your support, not insults and shaming. YTA", "YTA - Humiliation aside, if your mother weighs this much, she has more nutritional needs. Yes, it's true that she should reduce the amount she eats for her health, but her current body needs more food.

To put it bluntly\u2026 Disgusting behaviour, OP. Your poor mom.

The fact that you did in fact have a plate of the normal food implies that to me. So I don't think you're a giant AH, but you were intentionally poking fun at your mom, which is rude. \n\nIf you are genuinely concerned about making a healthy meal for her, ask her in private if she would like you to change up what you cook to something she'll feel less guilty about eating, or if she still wants to be able to indulge in some less healthy eats at family gatherings.", "NTA.

Did you really think serving her salad and the rest of you ribs without even mentioning it was going to go well. I understand your position by all means. You're worried about your mother's health, and probably sick of her using her loved ones as an excuse to ignore her health. This wasn't the way tho. It's going to make her feel singled out about and defensive as it did. If you guys want to help, really all you can do is lead thru example. When they are over perhaps it would be better to prepare more health focused meals for the group. That your mother can eat without as much concern. Altho not technically your job, i think that is a better approach. I would apologize though and let your mother know it comes from worry. You worry about her health, and want her around for many years to come.", "YTA.  I'm not sure how else that possibly could've been taken other than making fun of her weight.

Made low cal versions of favorites, or at least provided an actual meal salad rather than giver her a tiny appetizer salad and expect her to happily sit and watch everyone else continue eating- and eating ribs at that- for however long dinner would\u2019ve lasted.", "Frankly, OP needs to understand her weight/body is none of his f*cking business, and definitely not his spouses, even if the mom makes those comments. \n\nMore than likely, she makes those comments because she\u2019s self conscious and clearly has an unhealthy relationship with food. There are ways to approach this, but it is not the hill to die on, and absolutely 100% should not be approached unless he is ready and willing to show compassion. \n\nI get it - it\u2019s his mom, it\u2019s a health concern, but she is her own person and what he did here was grossly insensitive. \n\nAll that to say - ESH is not fair. Why does she suck? Because she\u2019s obese? Frankly I think she handled this with a lot more grace than most people would and it is right for her to take some distance. My man is way out of line.", "Jesus fuck, dude.", "Whoa. What the fuck?", "Dude that's someone's mom don't be a jerk.", "Truth hurts sometime", "\u201cOk everyone! Dig into these giant knockwursts & kielbasa. No, not you OP. You only get a cocktail wiener\u201d.", "Lmao that's not at all what OP did here. YTA OP, no need to humiliate your mother.", "Yeah I bet she has no idea she's fat, or that it's bad for you  She probably doesn't own a mirror or a scale. This salad will be life changing for sure \ud83d\ude44", "Yes, because the woman who already knows she has a weight problem is unaware of her weight problem. OP was being an ass just be be an ass.", "I don't think this is the way to show her", "\u201cobese and isn\u2019t taking responsibility\u201d doesn\u2019t give _your family_ the right to humiliate you at what is supposed to be a supportive occasion.\n\nhow in the world does that put her on the same level of AH as her son and DiL who planned to shame her for her weight?\n\nthey chose to go about a sensitive matter in the worst way possible, it blew up in their face, and it\u2019s likely she\u2019s going to be even more \u201cirresponsible\u201d (what a loaded fucking word) with her eating, in addition to knowing that her own kid thinks less of her for it.\n\nreal winners all over here.", "Pregnant currently and pregnancy sucks so much. It would break my heart if my kid grows to treat me like this.", "Seriously, I'm a mom and if this was my child, I would have left the dinner not about shame about my weight, but that I had apparently done such a shit job parenting my child that they thought this was OK.", "But op obviously cares so much.  He hates that his mom is fat.  That is part of the problem. He thinks his actions are justified because he believes she deserves it for being fat.", "Wholeheartedly agreeing with ESH. Undoubtedly, OP is one. But mom is an AH for always going on about how the weightgain is caused by the relatives, not hrr own actions.\n\n(Imo, I saw no shaming in the post, just someone being fed up with the mother's shame-game.)", "For real. Obviously she'd choose the ribs if they went bolting for a McDonald's afterward but OP should have offered everyone the same meal.", "Omg right! All I can think of is how awful I would feel if my mother was in the position of OP\u2019s mother. The complete embarrassment she must have felt in that moment. It\u2019s really one of those moments where everyone else is laughing and your face starts getting hot bc of how horrible you\u2019re feeling. Ugh, poor OP\u2019s mother. And the fact that this happened a week ago and OP is NOW thinking \u201cAITA?\u201d", "Well no one else is overweight so they are all in perfect health and all have the same exact dietary needs bc bmi scale. /s", "Yup. I\u2019m doing low carb now, so I would serve a roasted chicken, a vegetable dish and a salad. Simple, delicious and something everyone would enjoy", "Exactly! Singling her out by only giving her a salad while everyone else eats a full course meal is cruel and will do the opposite of what the purpose was. People\u2019s relationship with food is really important when it comes to their diet, and shaming people into eating a healthier diet does *not* work. If OP really wanted to help his mother eat a healthier diet, he could have served everyone a salad, and healthy options throughout the whole meal. Restriction isn\u2019t a healthy way to lose weight; it causes a lot of trauma, and it damages your relationship with food. \n\nThere are many ways to approach this with kindness and support, and OP chose to be unnecessarily cruel to his mother. Taking things away won\u2019t stop them from wanting it, but offering alternatives, support, and help with moderation would help much, much more. \n\nPlease speak with your mother OP. Apologize, and explain your concern and that you want to help her, but you now know you went about it in the incredibly wrong way. Get *her* feedback on what might be helpful to support her on her journey to becoming healthier. Offer to go on walks with her a few times a week, and this would be a great time to connect with her as well. Try different recipes to jazz up foods that may not be super appetizing. Help her look up meals that are healthy but that sound really good to her. So many things you can do to help, but giving her a salad isn\u2019t going to fix anything.", "Right? Like take her aside and have a quiet, honest conversation. 'Mum, you say you want to lose weight. Is there anything I can do to help?'\n\nOP, you could have fed everyone something healthy. You could have arranged to go on walks with her so she gets healthy exercise. Instead you shamed her in front of everyone. People who over eat often do so because it provides comfort that is missing in other areas of their life or because of low self esteem. Don't add fuel to the fire. \n\nI guess now she knows what kind of family she has  YTA, massively.", ">You humiliated her.\n\nAnd they did so deliberately, with a lot of forethought. They thought it out and orchestrated it for the optimum effect by simply leaving her out of the main meal. If they truly had her best interests at heart they would have discussed it with her beforehand, and asked how they could help her in her weight loss. But there would have been no humiliation factor in that, so what fun would that have been?\n\nYTA", "Yeah that's one of those moments that cuts so deep the relationship can never fully recover. Now that OP's mom knows what he's capable of, she can never fully trust or be comfortable around him again.", "I don\u2019t think an apology is going to help the level of hurt he just handed to the woman who gave him birth.", "I love the suggestion to talk with her privately to ask how to be supportive. \"You bring up wanting to lose weight often, but it sounds like you don't have anyone on your side. I'd like to be the one who helps instead of hinders. What can I do?\" OP, cruelty never teaches or supports anyone. It just degrades. One point to Slytherin for showing your ass in a public forum. I can't tell if you're on the verge of an epiphany or a clueless oaf.", "Exactly. If you're all so concerned about her health, why not serve a super healthy dinner for everyone?", "Take my poor man's gold \ud83c\udfc5", "Except it wasn\u2019t even to shame her and losing weight. It was just too spiteful. He get back at her for making those comments.  \u201cI purposely humiliated my mother because I find it annoying to listen to her be unhappy with her body\u201d", "Yes, this 100%. If he actually cared about his mother there are a hundred other ways he could\u2019ve gone about helping her. Instead he chose to single her out to make his disgust and contempt for her blatantly obvious. Why couldn\u2019t everyone have eaten healthier? Just because you\u2019re not obese doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re healthy. Also, you know nothing about health because of the fact that you simply chose a salad. Health is about balance and portion sizes. Salad isn\u2019t a fix-all. \n\nI get that it\u2019s annoying to hear someone complain about their weight when you don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re doing anything about it but she\u2019s clearly hurting and very insecure. There are so many other ways you could\u2019ve gone about this. \n\nYTA", "Go home, cry, and possibly drown her feelings in food. Shaming accomplishes exactly nothing.\n\nAnd I second the suggestion of Maintenance Phase! It's my favourite podcast.", "And on top of that the dad laughed at it! Everyone is the bad guy here!", "There is NO esh.", "I also wanted to add that humiliating someone like that is what causes people to have eating disorders. I\u2019d be surprised if your mom ever comes back over to your place for dinner again.", "If she is 195cm then no, it's just overweight. If she is any shorter, then yes, it's obese. Anything below 180cm and she's morbidly obese.", "Yeah but he didn't have to do it in that manner, he embarrassed her", "And an act of intentional humiliation. There were about a hundred different actions OP could have taken instead that would have yielded better results and been less of a dick move.", "Yes! Both the OP and his wife thought to themselves - let\u2019s humiliate, shame, and bully my mother (then dad chuckles?!). When if the OP was truly concerned for his mothers health the conversation with the wife would have been - let\u2019s find a healthy recipe we can all enjoy, support mom. \n\nWhen I was reading this post I kept thinking no wonder this woman is having troubles prioritizing herself. She is surrounded by AH!! I bet if she dumped all of your toxic asses, she\u2019d start on a health journey of feeling good about herself.", "This is the answer I was looking for.", "Exactly!! If anything, you probably made things worse for her. You should be ashamed to treat anyone like that, especially your own mother!! You need to apologize, without putting any of the blame on her, which is something I\u2019m sure you would do.", "that conservative meme thats been floating around \"see no fat people, no tattoos blah blah blah\"  \n\n\nyeah get bent", "One meal is not going to turn the tide.  Shaming a family member in public helps nobody.

Yeah her comments blaming others for her weight are shorty, but OP\u2019s action is so much worse that they get the single asshole designation in this conflict.", "Exactly this. You could\u2019ve made everyone eat a healthy meal, but instead you singled out your mother while everyone else ate ribs. Put yourself in your mother\u2019s shoes. What\u2019s her relationship really like with food? Usually people who are overweight use food as a comfort mechanism and have self esteem issues, there\u2019s a lot to consider here.

YTA.", "Yeah the father and OP are both huge fucking assholes.", "seriously, to come out with the main course for 3 guests at dinner and not the 4th is so incredibly mean.  \n\nYTA, op.  you can't reduce your mother's weight for her, but you can definitely sabotage your relationship with her by singling her out for being heavier than you'd like", "I couldn\u2019t do this to someone I hated.", "yeah, pointing that out doesn\u2019t mean that fat people are still not healthy \n\nAnyone can be unhealthy, people with large amounts of visible fat are never healthy", "She\u2019s sucks because she bitches and moans about her weight and blames everyone else for it by saying \u201cthey spoil her\u201d. She made it everyone else\u2019s problem.", "Amen, he and his wife were rude and very poor hosts.", "Yeah that would have been the appropriate way to approach having health concerns about your mother. Plus not eating isn\u2019t a good way to lose weight, it\u2019s about WHAT you eat and in what portions. Just not serving her the main meal isn\u2019t productive to building a healthy relationship with food. Contrary to popular believe, overweight folks still need to eat. I\u2019m sure since it wasn\u2019t the main meal the salad was small.", "Ok", "How fat she is or isn't definitely does depend (largely) on her height BUT it isn't relevant here-- if mom weighed 500 pounds in this situation it would not matter, OP was the asshole and if anything has worsened his mom's relationship with food and made her more likely to gain more weight, not the opposite.", "can't imagine why Mom is turning to food for comfort.......", "And since food is likely a crutch for dealing with stress, this would've only made the situation much worse.", "Counterpoint: sumo wrestlers.", "No argument there.
