For someone who needs to lose weight, every day, at least 3 times a day, you have to be making decisions about your intake. That means you are constantly subjected to food choices and thinking about food. In case you do forget about it, there is a constant barrage in the media about food, all designed to tempt people into eating more.

Scarfing a high fat, high calorie meal in front of her while giving her some lettuce and a few random vegetables (cuz I doubt you made a substantial salad for her)? Really?!?\n\nMany people eat for emotional reasons. Eating can be comforting. If your dad laughs at her for her weight and you and your wife have so little care and respect for her, is it any wonder that she reaches for food to cope? I\u2019ve packed on about 20 pounds because I\u2019m the caregiver for my husband who had a stroke, has other health issues and related dementia. There are times when I get overwhelmed and overeat. Emotional eating is a thing. I suspect that is at least in part what your mom is doing.\n\nAre you, your wife, and dad at your ideal weight? How is your blood pressure? Cholesterol? Triglycerides? Blood sugar? If you don\u2019t know get your blood work done.

She makes her own choices with whatever she eats, regardless of weight, you aren\u2019t the boss of that. Go apologize to your mother for that cruel action.", "YTA- if you were truly concerned about her weight and eating habits why not serve a healthy lower calorie meal? A roast chicken, salad and carb substitute like mashed cauliflower with fresh fruit for dessert? Soup and salad?  Grilled salmon and vegetables?\n\nNo, instead you chose to single her out by basically saying we deserve these foods while you do not so we'll just eat in front of you.  Not only are you a Supreme AH  you're also cruel.", "YTA. All that's going to do is push her into emotional eating", "YTA. \nDid it ever cross your mind how humiliating it would be for her to just sit there while the rest of you continued eating?

I want to make her a meal, whatever her favorite thing is to eat.  My mom died a very skinny 55 year old, my grandmother was always obese and was otherwise healthy and lively until right before she died at 98.  I don't know what fat person hurt you, but I don't feel like it was your mom.  Maybe you need to discuss your fatphobia with a therapist.  This is your problem to work out, not your moms.  I don't think a tearful, heartfelt apology is enough but its a start.", "YTA holy shit. you humiliated her in front of your family and expected it to go well?? you don't get to decide when exactly to start her diet. she's an adult, so treat her like one and allow her to make her own choices. if you're concerned, you do it in a way that doesn't involve putting her on the spot like that.", "YTA.

So many questions.\n\nHow is it \"spoiling her with too much food\" to serve her the same portion as everyone else? In what world did you think that this wouldn't embarrass her?

For fucks sake, Salmon can be cooked deliciously, and remain really nutritious and healthy.\n\nYou just wanted to humilliate your mom.\n\nIf her comments about being so spoiled with food are really that annoying to you, have an actual adult conversation with her, make plans with her to actually help her, don't make unilateral decisions just to \"teach her a lesson\".

I agree with another commenter that she\u2019s trying to make herself feel better and take the blame off of her\u2026 but the blame IS hers, that\u2019s the thing.

I have PCOS, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m big. I choose to eat carb heavy foods for many of my meals. If I ate more meat and greens, I would be smaller, regardless of my PCOS.

Lol. Sorry. I\u2019m autistic too and opinionated xD \n\nI will go with NAH. She needs to take accountability.. or not, but she doesnt need to make it your problem. You could be nicer and maybe make healthier meals as a family, but you don\u2019t have to. I recommend talking this out with her and finding a solution. Seeing what she actually wants. Does she want help, does she want to not do anything? Make it clear she can\u2019t blame you for her choices.", "YTA. She didn't ask you to put her on a diet, one meal won't make a huge difference and also if she wanted to go on a diet she probably wouldn't just have salad, she would be better off with a smaller portion of each.

Seriously, did you even think about how she'd react? Was there some fantasy scenario where you single her out to get no more food at dinner, and she is grateful to you enacting weight control measures on her without talking to her about it first?\n\nIf you were actually trying to help her you'd have talked to her about it and bring up your concerns. This was done to rub her face in her excuse-making, like she's a bad dog or something.", "ESH. You did what she is always complaining about. Maybe she\u2019s upset because she was using everyone else as an excuse for her weight related issues instead of placing the blame on herself.

For instance making a healthy meal you all enjoy, visiting her more to go for short walks, or helping her shop for healthier alternative (subbing quinoa for refined carbs, etc.) will make a world more difference than embarrassing her and making her relationship with food and dieting even more fraught.", "YTA\n\nThere are certainly better ways you could have gone about this without humiliating her and singling her out.\n\nPull her aside and ask her if she wants a different meal so she doesn't give into temptation.

Your mother is still a human being that deserves empathy. If someone says they want to lose weight, figure out how to help them on their terms. All you\u2019ve done is exacerbate the situation while acting like an immature child. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there is not a single bit of credible literature out there that says you should help your elder lose weight by not feeding her the way you do everyone else. Was this idea based in genuinely wanting good for your mother? Or the intent to punish her for making you listen to her complain? \n\n\u201cWell, you complain about it all the time. I\u2019m here to help you do it.\u201d\n\nWow. Great. She\u2019ll stop complaining about it in front of you and probably stop eating in front of you too. GREAT job, OP.

OP, what exactly did you think you were going to accomplish with this stunt? Did you think you were actually going to kick start your mother into a lifestyle you consider healthier? Did you think this was a good way to support her on her health journey?

You made her health and appetite the butt of a bad joke. You showed her that she cannot be honest about her health or feelings with you. Your \"helpfulness\" was a mean prank I would expect from middle schoolers. \n\nLook, if your actual concern is your mother's health, then by all means, talk to her about her health. Weight is just one of the numbers on a patient's chart; there are many others that influence how a person feels and how healthy they are. Ask if her doctor has suggested any kind of diet and how you can help. \n\nBut no, that would take actual effort and the ability to have an adult conversation. So much easier and more entertaining to make jokes about the fatty.\n\nThose comments about being \"spoiled\" and needing to lose weight your mother makes? Our society conditions women to hate their bodies--no matter what we look like--which leads us to make excuses as way of apologizing about weight. We have to live our lives apologizing for being humans with appetites and committing the sin of taking up space in public. \n\nOh, and by the way: at the age of 63, there likely is a lot more at work here than just eating more veggies. Once women hit their 40s, our biology starts making it very hard to lose weight. Also, your mom may be like me and have a wrecked endocrine system that makes losing weight almost impossible without additional medical intrevention. \"Calories in, Calories Out\" only works in closed systems, which the human body is not. \n\nSend your mom an apology via flowers. Explain to her that you misunderstood her comments about food and her weight. Tell her you want to support her in living a life that is good for her and want her to be happy. \n\nThen, get off your high horse.

You just started her with a salad like everyone else and then didn\u2019t serve again but expected her to sit at a table and watch other people eat. \n\nI\u2019m going to tell you this as someone who has been obese. You know how embarrassed we feel on a daily basis? You don\u2019t think we want to lose weight? So many things revolve around food.

A salad isn't very nutritious . You might get some vitamins. But you still need carbs, proteins and healthy fats. ~~Even if~~  Especially if you want to lose weight.\n2. Her body needs resources to maintain herself. \n3. There is a certain dynamic that makes feeling filled after a meal more difficult for people who are obese. I can't explain the dynamic well in proper terms, but basically their sense of being filled from food is disturbed. This adds to the issue of losing weight because it takes so much more effort to realize when you are actually full.

Did you really think serving her salad and the rest of you ribs without even mentioning it was going to go well. I understand your position by all means. You're worried about your mother's health, and probably sick of her using her loved ones as an excuse to ignore her health. This wasn't the way tho. It's going to make her feel singled out about and defensive as it did. If you guys want to help, really all you can do is lead thru example. When they are over perhaps it would be better to prepare more health focused meals for the group. That your mother can eat without as much concern. Altho not technically your job, i think that is a better approach. I would apologize though and let your mother know it comes from worry.

To get to a point of being overweight, often there is an issue with a healthy relationship with food. Being forced by someone else to eat a certain way or being made fun of for your weight will often lead you to eat more out of shame and as a way to cope. There is psychological reasons behind being over weight, it\u2019s not just a person making lazy choices. No one will be successful losing weight until they themselves are ready and until they start working on their emotional and mental well being as well.\n\nBack to my original point, you need protein to be healthy. So if the salad you served as a first course of a meal didn\u2019t have a meal sized amount of protein with it, you basically gave your mother rabbit food. Not eating enough actually leads you to store fat instead of losing it. If you want to SUPPORT your mother, instead of humiliating her, with weight loss you could just eat healthier when she is there. A lot of protein and veggies without a lot of unnecessary sauces and what not. Healthy food can be delicious and you don\u2019t have to suffer to eat healthy or lose weight. Especially if you are only cooking for her once every few months. Grow up and cook a healthy meal or cook what you want and let your mom eat it without embarrassing her.\n\nThe least you could have done if you were actually trying to help her would be asking her what she would like to eat or saying \u201cI know you have mentioned in the past that we might offer too much food. What would you like us to cook for you this time.\u201d But really, this whole thing wasn\u2019t about helping your mom at all, it was about being annoyed with her comments.\n\nEdit to correct that it doesn\u2019t technically store fat if you don\u2019t eat enough. This is how it has been explained to me in the past, but is not technically true. It can stunt weight loss for other reasons, and is overall unhealthy and not a sustainable way to lose weight.", "Completely agree. Can you imagine being the ONLY one who got a salad while everyone else is having a full meal. \n\nYou\u2019re beyond AH, you\u2019re disrespectful.", "Honestly, singling someone out by serving them a completely different meal than everyone else *no matter what it is* is weird as fuck behavior.\n\n Especially so when it's meant to body shame sometime. \n\nYTA OP how the fuck did you think this was a good idea?!", "Right. She's very clearly aware, and if she's commenting about it, it's because she feels embarrassed by it. \n\nWhy not just serve everyone salad.  Salads can be delicious... Fruits, veggies, lean protein.

Sticking to an eating plan is not easy. Feeling like you stick out in front of all your family while they eat a multi course meal and you get a salad would be humiliating.
