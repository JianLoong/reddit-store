It\u2019s a well-established norm that any additions or changes to the guest list should be discussed and approved by the couple to ensure a smooth and well-organized event.\n\t2.\tLack of Consultation: Regardless of the reasons behind your in-laws\u2019 actions, the fact remains that they did not consult you or seek your approval before inviting additional guests. This lack of communication is a breach of established wedding etiquette.\n\t3.\tTheir Responsibility to Resolve: While maintaining family harmony is important, it\u2019s equally important to emphasize that your in-laws should have taken it upon themselves to rectify the situation with their friends. They created the issue by extending unapproved invitations, and they should be responsible for managing it.\n\t4.\tProtecting Your Wedding: Assertively protecting the integrity and planning of your wedding is paramount. Allowing uninvited guests to attend without addressing the issue could set a precedent for others to make unilateral decisions about your wedding, potentially leading to more complications.\n\t5.\tSetting Boundaries: Taking a firm stance in this matter is not only about your wedding but also about establishing boundaries for the future. It\u2019s crucial to ensure that you and your spouse are the final decision-makers when it comes to your life events.", "Didn\u2019t happen.

My in laws invited an extra 10 or so people to our wedding as well, except we found out when they RSVPed (my MIL photocopied the invitation). \n\nI mean, more likely than not they did realize ... there's a point where people had to RSVP and they didn't think, \"these people need to RSVP\", I'm just always trying to find any sliver of a benefit of the doubt.", "Nta, but weddings suck, and should be affairs where everyone is welcome.

The Mexican culture is so hospitable that my family was seated at the head table;  my mother next to the bride! And they were treated as guests is honor.  Earlier that day , during their travels,  they were at a family member\u2019s house dropping off a relative.

We have to make adjustments on the fly if an inexperienced officiant skips their unity candle and just never goes back to it.
