If you're college age and they now have two younger kids it's quite an adjustment.", "NTA - but personally I would love the idea of forming a new bond with people who can be friends and my support for life. It's also a good opportunity to watch them grow up and mentor them without having to actually raise them.\n\nAlso aren't these your siblings now? Why are you still calling them your cousins?", "You\u2019re NTA yet, but depending on your age you\u2019ll still need to make an effort. They\u2019re your cousins - and kids first of all. They\u2019d love to spend time with you. Although the decision was your parents\u2019, you can choose to be a good influence on them.", "YTA - these girls are going to be in the rest of your life wether you like it or not. They\u2019ve probably not had a very good family life considering whatever lead them to being placed with your parents. I\u2019m not saying you have to be best friends with them but make the effort to get to know them and make them feel welcomed into your family/ they\u2019ve obviously had a pretty rough year and are finally getting stability with your parents so just try and make them feel like they belong", "YTA\n\nYou don't have to be super close, but you do need to be polite.  It's pretty rude to be living in the same house as someone and avoiding them so thoroughly.  \n\nAnd this isn't a yes/no thing.  You can be polite and engage in the occasional activity with them without committing to be their new sibling or backup guardian.\n\nYou haven't mentioned what happened to put these children in a place where your parents wound up taking them in.\n\nI guarantee that whatever happened, it was very, very traumatic.  \n\nImagine, at the age of 6 or 8, be sent across the country to live with strangers!  And then have someone in the house, at least part-time, who is constantly giving you the cold shoulder.  \n\nEven if you don't take on the full role of an older sibling, you need to be polite, and compassionate to them as human beings who have suffered an incredible loss. \n\n\"Not very good with young children\" is a statement of your inexperience, not an immutable fact about you.  As you go through life, you're going to need to interact with young children as an adult, now and then.  You might as well learn to manage that now.  Heck, you might even wind up with a few young children of your own, someday.  \n\nPositive interaction with these children is practice for a life skill you will be called upon to use, on occasion, for the rest of your life.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIn addition, these are your cousins.  Which means they are the children of a sibling of one of your parents.  Whatever happened to separate these children from their parents was a profound loss to one of your parents, who lost a sibling.  \n\nYou do owe that parent compassion and support, as a loving member of their family. \n\nYou rejecting your cousins so thoroughly is adding to the distress of your parent who is struggling to deal with the loss of a sibling and the new responsibility of caring for that sibling's children.  \n\nWhen you speak to your parents, remember you are speaking to people who are grieving whatever happened to have their sibling's family wind up this way.", "YTA Your cousins, who are just kids, have been through a major upheaval in their lives, and your parents made a compassionate decision to take care of them. Instead of showing a little empathy and trying to bond with them, you're choosing to stay distant and indifferent. It's not about whether your parents discussed the adoption with you; it's about being a decent human being and supporting your family during a tough time. You should make an effort to connect with your cousins and help them feel welcome in their new home.", "NTA but it\u2019s lol funny you\u2019ll be splitting your inheritance with them.", "YTA - kind of. \n\nI get not providing free child care or even taking them places but you\u2019re avoiding them all together. They likely came to your parents because of some sort of trauma and you\u2019re more or less treating them like tiny pariahs.", "NAH. You are a grown child and its not surprising that you aren't close to these two new kids. Neither is it surprising that your father hoped that you would be, and is disappointed (in the universe, not disappointed in you) that that didn't happen.", "YTA. Being a fucking human being and put some effort into getting to know your own family.", "YTA, or at least, you're being kind of weird about this. Your parents don't sound blameless, they definitely should've discussed this with you. But at the same time, what was the situation? Did they have a lot of time to discuss? I'd assume, if they adopted these kids, that they're going to be in your life for a while. What's the plan for the future, just keep ignoring them? You don't need to become bffs but you can try to engage a bit. I'm sure they also already feel pretty overwhelmed and having you treat them like an inconvenience probably doesn't help. Tbh it kind of sounds like you're upset at your parents about this decision, and it might be worth talking to them about it.", "Info: What was the reasoning for adopting them?", "Info:\nWhy did your parents adopt?\nYou mention that your parents didn\u2019t consult you. You\u2019re in college and don\u2019t live in the home. How would consulting you impact your decision to be distant?\nHow do you feel about the adoption in general?", "YTA that\u2019s your family and they\u2019ve been through a lot - you can at least try. Being older, you are likely super awesome in their eyes and your being an AH to them.\n\nYTA - why would they consult you?", "YTA\n\nI dislike children and might do the same thing in your shoes, but yeah, you\u2019re TAH for refusing to engage with people who are your siblings and close family members.\n\nAnd just don\u2019t forget, they will grow up some day, into adults, who might be super cool and fun. Don\u2019t burn any bridges.", "Yes, I think YTA.\n\nYou now have two little kids that your parents adopted.  That's quite an adjustment for them.  Did you ever consider that?\n\nWhat happened to being welcoming and nice?  \nEven if you weren't consulted about the adoption, would it be so hard to be decent/", "YTA Even if you don't care about the kids, you should care about your parents. Like it or not, these kids are going to be in your parent's lives from now on. They are going to be a big part of your parent's lives and you need to accept that. Unless of course, you intend to become estranged from your parents, in which case never mind.", "ESH, but not badly. I\u2019m assuming something major happened or they wouldn\u2019t be there, and sometimes things just have to be dealt with. That\u2019s the nature of emergencies. You suck a bit because it wouldn\u2019t hurt you to reach a hand out to these two little ones and make them feel a bit more welcome. Try to imagine yourself as a 6yo, suddenly removed from your parents and sent to a completely different family whom you hardly knew. Really, really imagine it. \nYour parents suck a bit because it sounds as if they didn\u2019t communicate with you very well before hand- I don\u2019t know, maybe there truly wasn\u2019t time.\n\nIn any case, you\u2019re away most of the time now, and your parents had a chance to offer these two a stable environment. By all means choose your own level and pace of involvement, but as a person with 3 adult children I promise you that if you\u2019re paying any attention at all, you\u2019ll learn more about yourself by spending some time with these two than from years of therapy.", "INFO: are your parents expecting you to watch your new siblings on your own as a babysitter, or are you being asked to go on family excursions with them? You say the main reason you don\u2019t want to get to know them is because you \u201caren\u2019t good with kids,\u201d so are you willing to spend time with your family if you aren\u2019t explicitly responsible for them? If not, then there\u2019s more to this then you not liking kids, and you should examine those feelings more before shrugging your parents\u2019 concerns off. The dismissive way you talk about your new sisters just kind of reads like you\u2019re bitter about not being the sole focus of your parents\u2019 attention anymore. But I\u2019m withholding judgement because there\u2019s a huge difference between being expected to accept them into to the family, and being expected to provide free childcare due to circumstances you had no choice in.", "You can make your own decisions, and that can make you an AH.", "It's just a bit awkward to call them my siblings because I barely know them.", "This.", "Talk to your parents.\n\nAdopting these children was a matter of law.  Are your parents trying to establish themselves as \"mom\" and \"dad\"?  Or are they still \"auntie\" and \"uncle\"?  \n\nThese kids are probably old enough to remember their parents, and may not be comfortable with your family in the role of parents and siblings.\n\nYour parents will be creating an emotional minefield if they try to erase the memories these children have of their parents. \n\nAs a cousin so much older than these kids, don't worry about being a sibling.  You can be the fun cousin, much like the \"fun aunt\" or \"fun uncle\" many people grow up with.  The occasional fun activity, load them full of too much ice cream, play games, tire them out running around the playground, and then hand them back to your parents, exhausted and on a sugar high.", "I'm going to switch to YTA then. You feeling awkward is not as bad as them feeling excluded and whatever else they went though to get adopted. Take getting to know them and make them feel welcomed as an opportunity to grow and work on your life skills.", "That doesn't explain why you're completely avoiding them rather than getting to know them at least a little.", "I'm also probably not going to see them very often, since I'm likely going to end up living across the country from my parents.", "NAH I think it's fine that he's disappointed. People get to feel how they feel and he doesn't seem to be nagging you about it. I think that you are also perfectly fine not wanting to bond and not feeling a connection to them. Sounds like your parents were behaving generously when they took in your cousins, but at your age and situation, it's not surprising that you would be focusing on your life and your priorities.", "NTA but from now on buy them Christmas & birthday presents. Or at the very least cards. What I\u2019m saying is include them in your family. You don\u2019t have to babysit them but you should not ice them out either.", "NAH, I can see why your dad is trying to have you bond with your cousins, but I can also see why you wouldn't be receptive to that due to how forced it is. \n\nBe kind to the girls and do actually try to get to know them at least on a surface level so they don't feel hurt. A little kindness and acceptance can go a long way. Best of luck to you and them.", "NTA. These children are strangers to you. I assume a summer job away from home is in the cards next year.\n\nYour parents are free to adopt but not to assume you're open to a relationship with the children.", "YTA just seems damn unkind.", "NTA. Your cousins have been through a huge upheaval in their lives. It would be AH behaviour to be cold towards them. But the real AHs in this situation are your parents for forcing this \u201cclose sibling\u201d dynamic on you. At the end of the day, it\u2019s their house and their life so it\u2019s ultimately their decision whether or not to take your cousins in. But if they wanted to foster a good relationship between you and your young cousins, the least they could have done is include you in the discussions and talk about why it is so important that they take on this huge responsibility. And it\u2019s a responsibility that they chose for themselves so I understand why you\u2019d feel upset that they signed you up without any input from you. Try and keep in mind who\u2019s the one really deserving of your anger.", "YTA. Are you planning to avoid them for the rest of your life? You don't need to be their best friend, but they're a permanent part of your family now. I don't see how you can realistically avoid getting to know them. They're children, and they live with your parents. They're going to be there every time you go home.", "YTA, a little. Ultimately it's your parents decision, presumably one of your parents siblings is unable to take care of the kids and they are family so they reached out and adopted them.\n\nBut they are family, whether you want them to be or not. So lets say you go home for xmas, they'll be there, it can be awkward, or you can spend a little time with them. Do you have to spend all day with them and become best friends, nope. But like it's normal for just family visiting that you make an effort to get to know them and these will technically be your siblings. You'll be seeing them at family events for the next like 50+ years potentially. Not being great with kids doesn't mean you can't spend a little time to start to build a relationship. Just hanging out and playing some console games a couple hours here or there will build a foundation for a future relationship.\n\nLike if your parents had a normal actual full sibling, would you also refuse to spend time with them or would you realise ultimatley that's family and it makes sense to get to know them?", "YTA. If these girls came to live with your parents, it had to be because of something terrible and traumatic that happened in their lives. You said that your parents weren't too happy about taking them in, but they did it because it was the decent thing to do. Your parents are good people and they did not need your approval. \n\nYou said that you stayed home during college breaks so that you would not add to the upheaval, but that is not true. You were being selfish. You could have helped and made the transition easier for your parents and the girls.\n\nNo, these girls are not your responsibility, but a kinder person would have at least tried to be pleasant to two little girls who have gone through something no child should ever have to face. You might even find that you could grow fond of them. At the least you could help your parents who have stepped up to the plate to take on a challenging task. You are seldom home, so it would not greatly inconvenience you to be nice on occasion.", "YTA for avoiding them and refusing to bond. You don't have to take them out/off your parents' hands but you should be friendly and engage in family activities together, because as everyone else is saying, these girls are your family and have probably been through some really rough times -- and you're the adult here.", "I'm going to say NAH. You're already well established in your life for the most part. You're an adult, you have life plans, and you'll be away. You never had siblings, and the age gap would have made things awkward even if you remained close to home full time after you're done with school. \n\nAt the same time, I can sort of see where your parents are coming from. Your cousins are your family and they're still in elementary school, and are now going to be a permanent part of the family dynamic. And even just the minimal amount of bonding could go a long way to help make them feel that they'll be loved, safe, and well cared for.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think this was a \"spontaneous\" decision on your parent's part. These things are almost never \"spontaneous\". I think it's actually a case of your cousins needing a stable home, and your parents stepped up. And if that is the case, then I commend them for that. That is certainly not an easy choice to make. At the same time, even with them stepping up, you're not required to do so, especially given that you're most likely not going to be home. \n\nMy suggestion would be sitting down with your parents and talking over the hows and whys. How did they end up in the situation. Why did they adopt your cousins. Why do they want you to bond with them. Things like that. \n\nAfter you get that information, bring up your feelings. How you feel regarding their choice, the age gap, the fact that they're still in elementary school while you're an adult who's about to be 100% on her own. \n\nOnce all is on the table, try to find a compromise that would work for you specifically. Maybe you can do one day a visit when you go home to see your parents where you do a bonding thing with the cousins (maybe go see a movie or go out for ice cream). Do phone calls every other week where you can to talk to them to check in on basic things like \"how's school\" and \"what games are you interested in\" and little things. Maybe start as a penpal thing and work your way up to something closer that you're more comfortable with. It wouldn't be much, but it would probably help, and it'd still be on your terms. \n\nI wish you and your cousins well OP. I hope things get better.", "NO I DON\u2019T WATCH \u201cWIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE. I'M AN ADULT!!!!!!\n\n- Larry David", " It would be nice to give the parents a break. They probably weren\u2019t too excited about starting over with some new little kids in the house.", "I'm feeling like the parents pressuring OP makes it likely that no more breaks will be spent at home", "If the parents need a break, they should hire a babysitter (who may or may not be OP, if OP agrees to watch them for pay).\n\nIf they weren\u2019t too excited about starting over with some new little kids in the house, they should not have taken on that responsibility.\n\nOP is not the parent, had nothing to do with the decision to adopt, and has no obligation to provide a \"break\" for adults who chose to take on that responsibility.", "I don't really know- they took them in because my parents take the idea of family duty very seriously but I don't think they were happy about it."]}
