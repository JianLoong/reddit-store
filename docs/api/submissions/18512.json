NTA", "NTA - a lot of old fashioned traditions are just weird and irrelevant in this day and age, but NOT this one!\n\nIt is so sweet, and practical, and kind, and REAL.\n\nI still remember when I moved in with my now fiance, a few of my best friends put together a backpack with every possible essential, from tampons and plan B, a burner phone, to a little flask of whiskey, to my color of lipstick, to emergency gas money and letters from each of them saying I mattered. The idea was the same, that if shit ever went really really sideways and I could only grab *one thing* and run, that I'd have everything I needed.\n\nIt wasn't that they didn't trust my future husband. They just wanted to make sure I was okay no matter what. It's probably the most meaningful gift I've ever received in my life.\n\nI'm so sorry she turned her nose up at such a kind welcome. The dollar amount isn't the issue here... Something like that MEANS A LOT. You're not being petty. You're giving her exactly what she felt she was worth.", "NTA.  The fiancee was rude and demeaning to important members of the family she's marrying into! I'm not sure I would have wanted to give her anything at all. Giving her the modern stuff she requested seems perfectly reasonable and kind after her wholesale rejection of the original gift idea.  She needs to grow up, apologize,  and learn that actions have consequences.", "NTA. How horrible tacky and greedy she is. I, for one, would have loved a hand made quilt. My grandma quilted (I can't sew worth beans) and I remember how much work went into one. She insulted your family's age old tradition, ergo she should be happy with what she is getting.", "NTA. \n\nThere are some old traditions that are past their prime, but a quilt that is essentially an emergency escape go-bag? Handmade by family members as a gesture of love and care for someone's continued well-being?\n\nThat is pretty amazing. \n\nI'm pretty modern, but I would probably cry if I knew that someone would want to do that for me. I might make an awkward joke or not know what to say, but it would definitely not be in a scathing tone.\n\nGifts are gifts. There might be some implied social expectations, but complaining about what you receive has always struck me as a churlish and entitled sort of behaviour. \n\nAlso, if I found I was getting less than I thought I might, I'd wonder if I did anything wrong or if my fam and friends were going through some things and my expectations needed to be lowered to accommodate their circumstances.\n\nIt's usually easier for me when people clearly state what's going on, but if I can't read between the lines I ask the opinions of my friends and partner about what they think might be happening. And if I find I'm in the wrong, I try to apologize, make amends, and genuinely try to learn how to be better.\n\nIf your brother is committed to this person, then yeah, you will probably feel better by putting more of your time and money towards the wedding gift so that he has what he needs and is supported. If this is the only red flag for this human perhaps returning to something of a more personal gesture might be nice to help repair things, but Only after she authentically initiates trying to bridge the gap. I suspect that this isn't and that she won't. Which is too bad, it sounds like she's missing out on a loving and supportive family community.", "You're NTA. She rudely mocked your entire family when you kindly and generously tried to welcome her to the family including her in the tradition. I'm not sure I'd have even given her a toaster. Maybe a book on etiquette would have been more appropriate.", "NTA. Not petty at all. I feel your tradition is beautiful and would feel so honored at being invited to take part in it. And I'm not a part of your family nor your culture nor your country of origin, so your brother is full of crap as well. I'm sorry you have a new member of the family who doesn't appreciate the history and tradition of the family. BTW, I'm not a tradition hound who insists things never change. I have no traditions to follow. But I do appreciate something so beautiful and meaningful when I see it.", "NTA. You are supporting her views about the tradition. She said it was weird. Why would she be upset because you listened to her? Embrace Amazon.", "NTA at all!  I think it sounds like a sweet tradition.  I'd have been honored to be included as your future SIL.", "NTA.  Sounds like a beautiful tradition.  That she was culturally insensitive to this tradition does not bode well for the marriage.", "NTA! She was insulting and no one is ever owed a gift. The toaster was generous.", "NTA Hopefully she learned a lesson from this.  Some things are best leftt unsaid.", "NTA I think this is such a sweet gift. The fact you included her was an amazing gift. Your family tried to accept her as a daughter of the family to welcome her and she shut the door in your face.", "Even if it seemed weird to people not in your family, the decent ones would be polite enough not to say it out loud. NTA she doesn\u2019t deserve the effort after being judgmental about a kindly meant gesture.", "NTA - are you Irish (or Irish descendants?  \nI ask because my family has the same traditions and we are Irish. \n\nYour future sil is reaping what she sowed. I cannot imagine acting so rude to the family I was hoping to join.  I expect your brother is questioning their future and if he isn\u2019t- he bloody should be", "NTA, sit down with your brother and have a long talk.  She mocked HIS FAMILY too.  She did not want to go with tradition but wanted big time gifts.  Does he want to bring this into his life?  If she keeps this up the extended family will shun them.  Does he really want to lose all of his family for herself centered attitude?", "Let\u2019s see:  she\u2019s not close to any of her family and massively insulted the one she\u2019s marrying in to - good luck, brother of OP\n\nNTA", "NTA - but had she not been harsh in her rejection, it would have been Y-T-A had you punished her for opting out.

It is amazing how centuries apart women still think the same way and try to take care of each other. The reason in my families case it was a quilt rather than a backpack or any kind of bag is that the bottom drawer was often overlooked by the husband and in-laws especially if you ensure it's nothing that looks too fancy so it was a way to ensure no one but the bride could get it.", "\u2b50\ufe0ftake my poor persons gold on this, it\u2019s so sweet", "FYI for anyone thinking of doing this: Plan B only has a shelf life of about four years and isn't as effective for women over 165 pounds. Ella is another emergency contraceptive, but it only works for women up to about 195 pounds. Taking either one is better than nothing, but just be aware that it might not work for you.   \n\nThat being said: I think making a getaway bag for a friend is smart, but if you're actually concerned about their partner then you need to be careful. If they're super controlling and abusive, there's a good chance that they're going to notice a random new backpack in the house. It would be difficult to hide. Knowing that their new/prospective spouse is capable of leaving at any moment could set them off and it could be dangerous. If there is a trusted friend or family member close by who could keep the bag safe, that's the best option.", "Scottish but we do have some Irish blood too, though lets be honest Scotland and Ireland do have a lot of similar traditions.

The one where the future DIL was supposed to wrestle a pig in her wedding gown... The one where she had to pass a \"cooking and cleaning test,\" that the mother and sisters in law would judge...\n\nThis one... Honestly comes from a place of love. And  real life. Sometimes things go wrong and it makes all the difference in the world knowing someone has your back. I can't imagine rejecting or belittling that. Is she just really young and naive? She's lucky she's getting a toaster!

I'd assume the first one was so they could laugh at me and the second abusive if I was marrying into those families. I have no idea which woman in the family started this tradition of hiding things within a quilt or what prompted this decision but it was passed down and carried on and it's something I rather love as you said it's real and a gesture of love. Maybe I got a bit too defensive at her reaction though. \n\nShe's in her late 20s so it's not down to youth but it could very well be just a naive mindset or just favours modern parties and lifestyles. I just didn't feel right not getting her *anything* when a gift was promised but I also didn't have the energy to put a lot of thought into it after her reaction so I thought a toaster was a good compromise.", "don't forget the one where the future groom wanted the OP to open her legs the night before the wedding with a ceremonial type thing with his dad, siblings, and uncles while they checked to make sure she was \"pure\"", "Damn! I was born in Ireland, and I wish I'd heard of this before. Do you think your family would mind if, some years from now, I might steal a variation of it if/when my little sister or my fiance's daughter gets married.

It was so lovely and refreshing to read your story.\n\nI think it's so... I don't even have words. I just remember how much it meant to me to know that someone thought of me and cared that much. Tbh I still think about that backpack when things get difficult, and just knowing it's there helps me carry on through the hard parts.\n\nI think a toaster is an excellent compromise as well. Like I said, you gave her exactly what she asked for. That's fair play. Don't even worry about being petty. Hopefully she'll come to appreciate her family in time.", "Of course we wouldn't mind! Feel free to steal a variation of it or the exact tradition it's nothing to be guarded for my family alone, it's just about taking care of your family and ensuring they have a safety net how could that be disrespectful to be inspired by?\n\nAs a Scottish woman I commend you for letting the whiskey last more than a day!

Is that the expectation of your brother? That he will abuse her or make her destitute? It feels like a really bad omen. That said, many others seem to like the idea so I suppose it's an individual opinion like any other gift. Which is why I think it's not right to get your nose all out if joint when someone doesn't like the thing you intend to give them without knowing that they want it. A gift is about the recipient, not the giver. \n\nIt was  right to find an alternative. I just hope some thought went into whether this item was wanted or needed. Sounds very much like the toaster wasn't  given with the motivation of a cheerful giver. Sounds more like it was used as a vehicle for petty spite. That is not what gift giving is about. \n\nSIL focusing on how much was spent is also receiving gifts in the wrong spirit. Whether anyone spent the same amount or not shouldn't be the issue. A thoughtful gift of $30 should be received as graciously as a thoughtful gift of $300. Also, it sounds like she lacks the kind of social graces in which you politely decline something you don't want.\n\nSeems like your brother can expect to be torn between his wife and the other women in his family if no one makes an effort to mend this petty rift.

Sounds like she would have been stuck quilting all party, which would be incredibly boring for a lot of people. \n\nLook it\u2019s a very lovely gesture, but it\u2019s very specific to your family and not everyone is going to embrace a tradition they\u2019re just hearing about the same way your family has because you grew up with it.\n\nSo I\u2019m going to go with ESH, for some of her comments and attitude towards gifts and the family\u2019s lack of understanding. \n\nHave a chat with her and cut her some slack, she\u2019s probably going to be the mother of your future  nieces/nephews some day.", "Oh wow.

She didn't deserve the quilt or the thought and energy that goes into it. You'd think someone with no family would be so grateful but not this woman apparently.", "NTA.  What a lovely tradition and too bad that she is the idiot that missed out.", "This woman doesn't understand what she's lost in the slightest. It's not wedding gifts she's lost. It's a place in a dynasty.\n\n\nI'm actually tearing up. I met my Polish Great Aunt who made it out of Europe to Chicago ONCE, and I was engaged. She got me a bunch of dishcloths, tea towels (mini towels for the kitchen, idk if they're popular except when sustainable companies are marketing 'reusable paper towels'). This would've been like 2009?\n\n\nMy mother gave me a PTSD episode when I asked her if she might be able to financially help out recently. I honestly treasure the memory of a relative going out of her way to include me in tradition & give me something to make my life more comfortable. The rest of them stayed here and live in grim, tooth gritted \"life isn't fair\" mode because even though we're not Jewish and we don't have the trauma of people trying to literally exterminate us which is a HUGE DEAL & I don't want to downplay it/compare it (so I'm explicitly saying it's not the same), we lost everything cos Grandpa wasn't able to re establish contact with anyone in Poland until the 50s, I think, by which time our occupied family land was given to someone else.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, being given something to make a home with meant even more coming from her. She walked from Poland to France & got to Ellis Island. She was a bar tender for 40 years. She raised her grandkid cos the mother wasn't great apparently after my second cousin died, so.... \"I take child! I raise him myself!\" (no details, but it sounded justified).\n\n\nShe stayed up till 4.30 drinking tequila depth charges and telling me stories from old country that nobody else told. I'm so glad she got to heal from some of the trauma. All her brother got was called a dirty Polak & a severe anger problem:/\n\n\n\nThis GIRL will never get to learn as much of the family lore as she could, and any kids will hopefully be included despite her, but she's put THEIR sense of belonging at risk. Families matter to people who have good ones AND people who have bad ones. They don't matter to... well, assholes", "Not only that, but I know a lot of modern women who could have used a quilt like that to help them escape an abusive relationship. NTA", "It almost sounds like an insanely expensive Advent calendar. It sounds super cool.", "even if I thought it sounded a bit old fashioned, I would have felt so special and loved if my fiance's family wanted to do this for me!", "I literally would have cried\u2026 to get something handmade from the ladies of the family at all, plus the added sentiment of taking care of me if I needed it.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine scoffing at that and calling it weird.", "Oh I'm kinda happy that this is a thing multiple families do. It's just really caring and pretty smart. Especially as a tradition from times when women had less ability to escape bad relationships.", "I would ugly cry if someone gave me an heirloom worthy gift. PRICELESS!", ">Cause logically who says no to a family activity that involves people giving you things to help you out in a theoretical future where you might need it? Especially when the family activity is with your in-laws?\n\nThose who don't want to spend hours with people they don't know very well, doing something they absolutely don't enjoy, while pretending they aren't all the miserable would probably rather say \"no\".", "Yep! Well he\u2019s more my aunt\u2019s pet pig but yah she named him Hamilton", "Your brother should be embarrassed. What she said was shameful and rude. You and your family are NTA and I wouldn't have gotten them anything lol.", "Wait.  This sounds a lot like an earlier post about future SIL not getting a $50k necklace...", "Well, now you can bring this to your brother as proof that roughly 400 strangers online agree that it\u2019s a really sweet and thoughtful tradition. She\u2019s the odd one out. NTA", "NTA\n\nThis is the second story where the SO is so dismissive of their future spouse\u2018s culture/traditions. I don\u2018t understand why anyone would marry someone with a different background and be confused when it actually presents itself in their family life/life in general?? \n\nIf you have such an aversion to cultures that don\u2019t align with what you\u2019re used to, have you considered not marrying someone with a different cultural background as yourself? \nOP\u2018s FSIL sounds dumb as hell", "What a beautiful tradition, it\u2019s a lovely way to welcome women into your family circle. Unfortunately this dorkus doesn\u2019t deserve anything but Amazon gift cards. She\u2019ll deeply regret her behaviour.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t have even given her the toaster.", "NTA. This sounds like a beautiful tradition, and the SIL is a jerk as well as the AH for disparaging it. It's not antiquated. Plenty of women find themselves in dire situation. Being able to have an out is nothing to sneer at.", "Ohh what a wonderful idea!! I\u2019d absolutely love this!! Her words were disrespectful and sometimes karma comes back swiftly", "I couldn\u2019t agree more!", "Thanks. Now all I have to do is learn how to quilt \ud83e\udd14", "My husband\u2019s colleague crocheted a blanket for our little one when he was born. It was beautiful and so sentimental that she would take the time. We used it for the next baby and plan to give it to kids when their babies are born.", "Yeah, did you read OP's explanation for what the tradition has become? She mentions repeatedly how these days its also used for unexpected expenses and that this was explained to her future SIL with the example being how her mother (future SIL's future mother in law) used it to pay for the roof falling in of their childhood home.  See here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vb23d/aita_for_giving_my_future_sil_a_cheaper/jm6no78/", "Yes, but wouldn't you just say 'no' and make polite excuses rather than repeatedly insult the tradition of the family of the person you're about to marry? Besides of which, OP pointed out repeatedly (i.e. here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vb23d/aita_for_giving_my_future_sil_a_cheaper/jm6ou45/) that her future SIL wasn't going to be doing any quilting.  There'd be talking, food, stories - it was a family bonding event.", "I'm extremely grateful whenever someone has given me something handmade, but I definitely skew to the latter. I do not put any emotional value on items, they're used for a purpose and discarded when I no longer need that purpose fulfilled. So handmade stuff is absolutely wasted on me due to that. I'm not going to keep something because of where it came from."]}
