{"id": 22476, "submission_id": "1521pug", "title": "AITA for Making my Autistic Daughter Attend a Specific College because of its Rules?", "selftext": "To put this into perspective, my daughter (18) is autistic and has wanted to attend college for several years now. She just graduated high school. However, due to aspergers (she prefers that word), she is often extremely naive and has, on multiple occasions, gotten herself into trouble for blindly doing the dirty deeds of school bullies. She often needs to be told how to do things that many neurotypicals her age know how to do. Other than that, she is very book smart and earned a 3.75 GPA in high school. \n\nThere is a school in western Florida called Pensacola Christian College (PCC) that my wife and I believe would suit her best. We\u2019re not very religious, but we still think PCC is the best choice because it offers a sheltered, secure, and strict environment. For instance, they have a demerit system which keeps student accountable for their actions, and student court is required for each offense. Also, there are many required events that not even most Christian colleges have. These include mandatory attendance at fine arts plays, commencement, and every undergraduate student is assigned to a gender-segregated society (Greek Life). From what I\u2019ve gathered, this is to keep a sense of community within the college, and to keep the traditions of Bob Jones University alive (the alma mater of the PCC founders). There is also a campus-wide curfew to keep students safe. \n\nWe did a tour of the university campus last November, and it\u2019s beautiful! She also enjoyed it and the chapel service that was included. Unfortunately, she has now decided that she does not want to attend this college because she read the student handbook. Particularly, she is not fond of the strict rules. However, we have already paid tuition, which is extremely cheap for a private university. My wife and I consoled her and mentioned that we must try to overcome the challenging aspects of life. These rules are out in place for the students safety. We even told her the college has a \u201chotel\u201d that parents and visitors can lodge at, and that she can invite us whenever she wants. She still doesn\u2019t want to go, but we told her that since we\u2019ve already paid tuition, she needs to attend for at least this semester. Then she can drop out or transfer if she chooses.", "created_utc": 1689599808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1521pug/aita_for_making_my_autistic_daughter_attend_a/", "score": 765, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let her go to an actual community College, not a non accredited place that only seeks to control.", "Pensacola Christian has one of the most oppressive environments that is also actively anti-gay. They are more about rules than they are about grace. It's the worst side of Christianity. I would never ever send a child of mine there. \n\nIf you're looking for a school that knows how to integrate neuro-divergent people--check out Mercyhurst University. My friend's son who is also on the spectrum graduated from their program, and it was everything that you wish PCC was. Special dorms and advising. Accommodations for differences in learning. Good programs. And they are accredited, she wouldn't be getting a wasted degree. He is now holding a job and living independently of his parents after graduating. You couldn't ask for better results.", "YTA. That college isn\u2019t even accredited. Her degree would be worthless.", "My heart sunk when I read it was the famously abusive PCC.

There are rules about how to dress (women can\u2019t wear trousers outside their residence hall), how long men\u2019s hair is allowed to be, no dying hair bright colours, no piercings or tattoos. No smoking or drinking, even off campus. No attending a movie theatre (!!) or concert. No listening to \u201cunsuitable\u201d music. No watching TV or movies with any \u201cadult\u201d themes.

I can't believe this is real, it's like reading a Cult handbook from 1950s.

I wouldn\u2019t touch the place with a long stick. Your daughter is autistic, not a child, she can make her own decisions as to where she wants to obtain her education, and how to go about it. As an autistic woman myself, who attended University in the UK I found it a fantastic experience where I was able to grow as a person, you learn life skills alongside academics. \n\nLet your daughter make her own choices, frankly its likely to be far better than yours \ud83d\ude16", "I work with some people at a Christian publishing agency: they are mostly conservative evangelicals, so I don't talk politics with them.

Your daughter is never going to learn how to learn to say no and find her own way if you put her in a glass jar. Genuinely, a 35 year old aspie woman who's been used and was too naive for her own good. Eventually I learned, and I'm happy I did. Some of the things I went through were horrible, but they helped shape the person I am today and I sure love that person and who I've become. Don't stunt your daughter because of her disability.\n\nEdit to add: I just read most of the Handbook for the school OP wants their daughter to attend and it's horrible. Aspie people tend to want to follow their own way and there could be sensory issues involved. The dress code is a nightmare of its own right. \nAlso, why would OP enroll their daughter in a Christian school? I was in Catholic schools until my last year of school before uni. There I met some of the worse judgemental people and bullies I had the displeasure to meet.

I think you are intentionally blind to this as this college promises you the most control over her and you equal that with safety.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t look for the program that would best accommodate her disability. You looked for the most controlling cage you could find. \n\nMost teens I know would have a hard time with the rules you\u2019ve outlined. Someone with autism would have an even harder time with arbitrary patriarchal bullshit. \n\nThat school is designed for culty families to have a culty place to send their kids so they have the illusion they got out into the world but don\u2019t end up in real danger of leaving the cult.", "INFO: Be honest here. Did she actually agree to go and make the choice to attend this place herself before changing her mind? Or was she coerced?\n\nEDIT: Yeah YTA.

Your daughter should have her choice of schools. Not every school is for everyone but your daughter should get a chance to go where she wants.", "So the main concern is that your daughter is so na\u00efve and sheltered that she cannot function as an adult. How is the solution to that putting her in a place that is even more restrictive and 'sheltered' than her current situation? Even ignoring the blatant sexism of the college, that the 'demerit' system would work against her if she's prone to following what others say (she will get the blame and her bullies will laugh behind her back) and the fact that you might be crippling her career by getting her a degree from a poorly accredited university, **what are you going to do when she gets out of there?**\n\nMany people with Aspergers (high functioning ASD), including myself live full independent lives as adults. College is a great place to become more independent; in most colleges there are systems and training wheels in place to help kids (of all types of neurodiversity and normality) to live on their own. By crippling her and taking her chance to develop strategies to cope with her challenges, you are lowering the chances she will be able to function independently as an adult. Is that what you want? To take care of your \"mentally disabled\" child for the rest of your life? Because that is what you're encouraging her to be.

There's a REASON this college's tuition is extremely cheap. The \"education\" students receive there is garbage.

If she withdraws before classes start, you get a full refund on tuition. They say room and board can be prorated, so it sounds like you can get that money back too. School doesn\u2019t start until August 29 - get your money back and help her figure out a better fit. \n\nSending a daughter with Asperger\u2019s to a Christian college when you are not Christian is absurd to me. This sounds like it will be a hard transition and damaging to her. She will not only have to adjust to college but to people with a different set of values and lifestyle than her. \n\nAlso did you even check to see if this university has services to support her? Do they have a good track record with supporting students like her? Those are the questions I would be asking a college. Have you been honest with your daughter about what \u201ctraditional\u201d college social experiences are like? Your daughter is absolutely right to change her mind after reading the handbook.

Rules set by Christian institutions are actively hostile towards autistic people and more likely to punish autistic traits.

It is important that we plan things for ourselves rather than someone else do it for us.

You can get demerits for so much as hugging a friend of the opposite gender.

She just graduated high school. However, due to aspergers (she prefers that word), she is often extremely naive and has, on multiple occasions, gotten herself into trouble for blindly doing the dirty deeds of school bullies. She often needs to be told how to do things that many neurotypicals her age know how to do. Other than that, she is very book smart and earned a 3.75 GPA in high school. \n\nThere is a school in western Florida called Pensacola Christian College (PCC) that my wife and I believe would suit her best. We\u2019re not very religious, but we still think PCC is the best choice because it offers a sheltered, secure, and strict environment. For instance, they have a demerit system which keeps student accountable for their actions, and student court is required for each offense. Also, there are many required events that not even most Christian colleges have. These include mandatory attendance at fine arts plays, commencement, and every undergraduate student is assigned to a gender-segregated society (Greek Life). From what I\u2019ve gathered, this is to keep a sense of community within the college, and to keep the traditions of Bob Jones University alive (the alma mater of the PCC founders). There is also a campus-wide curfew to keep students safe. \n\nWe did a tour of the university campus last November, and it\u2019s beautiful! She also enjoyed it and the chapel service that was included. Unfortunately, she has now decided that she does not want to attend this college because she read the student handbook. Particularly, she is not fond of the strict rules. However, we have already paid tuition, which is extremely cheap for a private university. My wife and I consoled her and mentioned that we must try to overcome the challenging aspects of life. These rules are out in place for the students safety. We even told her the college has a \u201chotel\u201d that parents and visitors can lodge at, and that she can invite us whenever she wants. She still doesn\u2019t want to go, but we told her that since we\u2019ve already paid tuition, she needs to attend for at least this semester. Then she can drop out or transfer if she chooses.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

College should be an opportunity to start making your own choices, students are supposed to be living a more adult life, and that means having to leave the nest. \n\nA strict religious college is just a boarding school - it sounds as though they have the same rules as she would have experienced at school. Being in a gender segregated community means that she will be pushed back even further with building healthy relationships with people that are different from her. I\u2019m guessing that you want her to start identifying the things she needs reminding to do, that you want her to develop normal social behaviours, and be able to experience the real world. \n\nThere are things that you can do to set her up for success, for example, having her rooming with a friend, or have some sort of support person visit her to check how everything is going. The school should also have some sort of disability office (I\u2019m not saying your daughter is disable for being neurodivergent, just that it\u2019s an option) and the school can create allowances to help her succeed in classes. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason that the school is notably cheaper than other options, and that\u2019s because they have a very limited pool of potential students, they have to lower the price in order to bring new students in.
