{"id": 13694, "submission_id": "128efy3", "title": "AITA Monthly Open Forum April 2023: Rule 9 - Do Not Ask For Advice", "selftext": "#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\n\nAfter covering a pretty big rule last month, we\u2019ll pull it in a bit and go over one that\u2019s a little more straight forward - rule 9.\n\nThe title of the rule pretty much covers it \u2013 we are not an advice sub. The question may come up as to why we don\u2019t permit advice-seeking posts. The answer is pretty similar to why we don\u2019t permit relationship posts. Reddit is full of advice subs, and we simply are not interested in being one of them.\n\nPosting here is about seeking moral arbitration, not advice. OPs should present the situation so members can weigh in on who was the asshole in the situation. Sure, advice may be offered in the comments, but the point of posting should not be to solicit advice. And commenters are under no obligation to offer solutions to a problem for OP. If an OP happens to get some advice while reflecting upon the situation, that\u2019s great! And fantastic if that advice happens to be good advice! But just as often, bad advice gets thrown around because our role isn\u2019t to moderate the quality of advice given. This is why rule 9 is important - to ensure users know they shouldn\u2019t expect to find advice here, but instead post because they\u2019re seeking the judgment this space is dedicated to provide.\n___\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.
