Also, why should I go out and buy new ugly plates when I got 30+ for free?", "I have a few random Spode pieces that I take along for picnics (or if I have to take lunch places) but not a full set.", "Or use it.  My son inherited some from his grandma, so he absolutely uses it on his DND nights when he hosts.  Cut up sub sandwiches on a huge China platter,  bowls of chips and dips and potato salad.  Simple food eaten on bone China with a big brass candlestick in the middle of the table with a lit candle in a dimmed lit room.  His friends say it sets the atmosphere for the campaigns.  \n\nHe's even used it for picnics.", "I have this hand painted Japanese china set I received as an engagement gift- I need to check this out!", "Just looked up dragonware, it's fully sick and I'd totally have like, one cup, but not a whole set just to display", "That\u2019s the way! China should be *used.*", "My cats eat and drink out of only the FINEST cut crystal bowls (that their millennial mother bought from an antique store). I firmly believe that using fancy things for non-fancy reasons just turns you into a cooler, fancier person!", "Hear that, u/Inevitable-Picture64 ? Forget the king, you can use it when the game master comes over.", "So glad to know that I am not the only person that has done this and served their cats like royalty. All kitties deserve the best."]}
