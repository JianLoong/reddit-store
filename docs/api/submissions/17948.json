It has so much sentimental value to them, so of course she wants it to stay in the family!

I would probably fill that with liquor too.", "That set might go for 200$ on Ebay...", "Do you ever use the stuff in the cabinet?", "I use my fine china at holidays and parties. If my children and grandchildren are all here, I need a set for 15 people. My everyday dishes wouldn't begin to be enough to feed all, and if I am going to put the effort into a large sit-down meal, I don't want paper plates and plastic cups.", "Your sister is a boomer at heart.", "I've used inherited crystal bowls to serve wet catfood. Looks like Fancy Feast.", "They will either bounce or shatter into a gazillion tiny slivers. There is no in-between, lol", "I got goose Corelle,  My husband was a young widower.  She died in an accident about shortly after their year anniversary.\nI just am not into the goose with the prairie hat.  I really didn\u2019t care about the furniture.  I have never been jealous of her.\nI just told him the geese had to go.", "They do, until they don't. When they get too old, or if they hit too hard, they shatter like a window pane. Fine shards that fly everywhere. Our church used white Corelleware dishes. They had enough to serve 150. The shelves were overweight and one night the upper one broke causing the lower shelf to break also. Fine shards of white Corelleware all over the kitchen and 40 feet into the next room.", "Until they get old. Then when you drop one, it\u2019s thousands of needle-like glass pieces everywhere.", "I ended up with Grandma's secretary. It houses beer glasses.", "When I finally get one, it's going to be full of bones and rocks.", "Or for our action figures or Lego sets.", "Mine was for bongs and shiny rocks.", "Some of the figurines were made in China, does that count?", "My mother owns two China cabinets. Fuuuuuuk.", "I checked after my mom gave \u2018em to me. They sell, but not enough to make it worth my while to sell them by piece or as a lot. Shipping ceramics properly costs a lot of money and time.", "I worked at Target for almost 5 years. The 3 times I saw someone break Correll plates there were shards stretching all the way from the checkout lanes to the grocery department.", "Oh, my Omi (German for Grandma) would have loved that!", "I got the China without the cabinet and that crap is put away in a cupboard until I get around to valuing it and putting it on Ebay. I should do that before the Boomers all disappear because I cannot imagine a single Gen Xer paying good money for this rubbish.", "If I ever get one it's going to be where I display my collection of penis-themed tchotchkes.", "Oooh a curio cabinet. Excellent!", "MINE IS FULL OF BONES AND ROCKS!! I got it from an older lady for free and it lights up and everything. Keeps the cats away from my bird feet and bones. 10/10 do recommend", "Sooo you're into bone china and stoneware? \ud83d\ude09", ">When I finally get one, it's going to be full of bones and rocks.\n\nBe careful, some spouses/partners don't respect someone's prized collections and might throw them out in the garbage.  (sorry another thread)", "I like this! We have a hutch/china cabinet and my husband just added some action figures amongst the various dishes.", "My cousin has vintage Transformers in his.  It's pretty sweet, not gonna lie!", "Touch\u00e9.", "Is that a \n     \"What do I do with two china cabinets?\" Fuck? \n      Or\n     \"I should start stocking up on my liquor\" fuck?", "If you ever break one in your home, you should probably file an insurance claim and hire one of those disaster restoration companies to clean it up.", "They literally explode if the impact hits them a certain way. I love corelle, but I got rid of the ones I had when my kids were little because I broke one, and I was finding shards in the house months later.", "Seriously...I was glad when one of my aunts wanted my grandma's china and I was able to convince my mom that she should have it as grandma's child (my mom thought I should ask for it, despite me neither wanting or needing fancy dishes). I got the stand mixer and her nice mixing bowls.", "The Boomers already inherited their China or got it as a wedding gift. You may as well donate yours now.", "When my ex and I split, we had a minor quibble over who got what kitchenware. I wanted the Magnalite her step father had given us. (He's cajun, it's an OG Magnalite. Best cookware I've ever used!)\n\nShe wanted the fine china my mother had given us.\n\nI said deal, easy trade.\n\nMy mother was a bit upset, but she admits that the Magnalite was a nice trade. It's so good, one of those 'they don't make them like they used to' items.", "Better idea: just eat off it. When my partner and I have broken all of our move-out-of-home plates I plan to pull my grandma's ugly ceramic dinner set out of storage so I can use it for its intended purpose.", "Same. You\u2019re my tribe."]}
