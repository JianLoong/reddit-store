We live in an expensive city so, housing is hard to come by. I moved out young and was living on my own since 2014. In 2019, my twin was ready to move out but needed a roommate to help with bills and such as she was a student, so we decided to move into a place together. We went looking for housing the next day and we lucked out and found a nice basement suite in a quiet, but central area of our city. The only caveat was one of the bedrooms was less than half the size of the other. Initially, I told my sister that I did not want to move in because I didn\u2019t want the smaller room, and I was happy where I was. She didn\u2019t want the smaller room either, so that was that and we decided to look elsewhere. After searching for a few more weeks, we realized that no other listings were as good, so my sister called me and proposed we take the initial place and said she would take the smaller room and said that we would switch rooms annually. I agreed, so we moved in she stayed in the smaller room, l while I moved into the larger room. After the first year, we switched and she took the larger room. Another year passed and this was when she was at the height of intense school and her schedule was chaotic so I asked her: do you want to stay in the larger room another year? Thinking next yrs I\u2019d move in and stay two yrs also. She agreed.  \n\nI broach the subject of moving rooms, and my sister is agitated, she tries to bribe me saying she\u2019ll buy anything so that she can keep the room. She even asked me if there was anything she could do to keep the room. While I appreciate this, I just don\u2019t think you can put a price on a good night's sleep, especially as a student. So I told her no thank you and that I\u2019d still like to still switch rooms. She has been dragging her feet since, so I brought the topic up again. I told her that I have been more than fair even staying in the smaller room for an extra year because I wanted her to get through her schooling and term without stress. She then went off on me about how it\u2019s not fair that I get the bigger room because she does more work around the house and that I\u2019m never there because I\u2019m always away at my bf's house and how she's to graduate nursing school soon and will be doing shift work so she would need peace and quiet in the large bedroom. I was shocked because we divide the housework evenly. \n\nShe then told me that if she can\u2019t have the larger room, then she is going to move out. I understand that this is totally her right, but now that I am a student too I can\u2019t afford to rent this place on my own and she knows that. Now I do not know what to do, and I am sad because she knew that she would have to move from the larger room at some point but now she\u2019s trying to get out of it. I gave her 24 hrs to move her things or I will be going in and doing it for her. She is in her room now and is very upset with me. \n\n AITA?", "created_utc": 1673168379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106ekpb/aita_for_booting_my_roommate_out_of_their_room/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
