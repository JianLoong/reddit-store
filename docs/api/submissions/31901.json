If you do not have a written lease agreement.. it might be time you got one. With a pet damage agreement, maybe a bump in the rent to be put into savings to repair the inevitable pet damage. You also need to add in a pet limit, and if size is an issue add in a weight clause. \n   FYI the reason most people think Danes are destructive, is due to them having \u201cseparation anxiety\u201d but if they have multiple pets then that should not be an issue. \nThat being said NOBODY SHOULD GET A DANE, WHEN THEY KNOW THE LANDLORD SAID NO.

Both sides need to be absolutely clear on what is legally allowable. A formal month-to-month lease gives you both protection.", "NTA, But you're a fool for letting them rent from you in the first place. You knew their pet hoarding habits and that this would make it so any other landlord would turn them down. \n\nYet you went out of your way to provide for them and are now concerned about property damage? Why do you think no one would take them in in the first place lol? \n\nYou'll regret getting them a place for years to come. This is probably only the first of many complications to rise up.", "NTA You stated their previous home was dilapidated.

My aunt had one, and my dad jokingly referred to him as a small horse instead of a dog.\n\nEven if there was adequate space, you are the landlord and have the right to decide how many pets you allow your tenants to have. And you are not being unreasonable. They already have eight pets in the small house.", "You are allowing them to hoard pets. That isn't healthy. No wonder their other place was dilapidated. I would have them send back the great dane and agree to no new pets, even if one dies or runs off.", "Great Dane owner here. Also served on the board of a dog rescue non-profit for about 15 years. You are NTA. \n\nI adopted mine when she was already an adult, so granted, she already had 'good manners' in the house when I got her. But outside the house? Not so much. On our first walk, I quickly learned that 1) she hadn't been leash trained, and 2) she is dog reactive. Painful lesson, let me tell you. I have spent literally years training her and now, she's great outside ... most of the time. She's still dog reactive, but she has learned some coping strategies and we're working on drilling them into her so they're instinctive. It's a process, even for someone with extensive experience working with dogs.\n\nAnd for the record, when I first got her, I was living in an apartment that was just under 900 square feet. My current one is 1,200. The only damage (thankfully) she has done to my house is when she didn't realize the screen door to the balcony was closed and she Scooby-Doo-ed her way through it. \n\nAll that to say: Danes are wonderful, they're (usually) gentle giants, and they don't need a ton of space.\n\nMy biggest issue with your in-laws' decision is this: My dog eats 6 cups of food a day, 7 if we've been more active than usual. That's not including the treats/dental bones/milk bones she also gets regularly. She goes through about 50 pounds of food every six weeks, at a cost of about $130. Additionally, medications for dogs are done by weight, so I pay WAY more for her meds than my friends with smaller dogs. Add in vet bills, the (mandatory) massive dog beds in every room, training classes (1,000% necessary, to control a 'house horse'), specialized equipment (leashes, toys, collars, etc.) made for giant breeds, etc. and I drop, on average, $300/mo. just on her needs. Thankfully, the only 'surprise' vet bill I've had so far is when she needed major surgery to remove four teeth -- $2k. But she's a senior dog now, so I'm expecting more of those.\n\nI am having a hard time understanding how a family who is struggling to get by -- and who already has a gazillion pets -- can justify the massive expense of a giant breed dog. Not to mention the fact that they don't sound particularly experienced at or capable of handling one.\n\nMy other issue here is that the ONLY reason they're in a situation where they could even consider this is because of you and your wife. You'd think they'd show some appreciation, some consideration. You said no -- TWICE -- and they did it anyway. That's a slap in the face. Honestly, if I were you, I'd be considering telling them this landlord/tenant situation is not working out and that they need to find another solution for their housing so you/your wife can go back to just being family to them.", "NTA, however, the rest of the family will have an opposing opinion.\n\nStand your ground", "Yta if let them keep that dog. You need to think in what the dog need, not what your mil wants or wish.  They had no home,  the can't feed or give him proper space to run arround and be happy , they are just crazy people who doesn't care and are irresponsable.", "Here\u2019s a different take: YTA. Buddy you\u2019re not helping them, you\u2019re enabling them.", "You said no. They are taking advantage of if they can afford another dog, they can afford to move out. NTA and give them 4 weeks notice", "ESH.\n\nThem for abusing your generosity by getting the dog you expressly asked them not to get; and you for your bizarre concerns about Great Danes.\n\nWhy would a Great Dane cause damage to the home? Why would you think they'd bite someone? They're very gentle and laid back dogs. \n\nI get the concern about the cost of its food, but that's not really any of your business. Just because you let them live there for a reduced rent doesn't mean you get to police their expenditures.\n\nUltimately it's your property, so it's your rules. I'm just a bit offended on behalf of Great Danes. lol", "YTA: You did not place any such restriction on your rental agreement, and also by the words you used did not outright tell them that as their landlord you were not allowing them.

You've got a real problem on your hands ,maybe all their animals is what destroyed their last home . Better stand tall and tell them they are done !", "NTA - you are the landlord and can refuse pets.\n\nHowever, as a Great Dane owner, you likely have the wrong impression of the breed.  Most, but not all, Great Danes are big lazy babies.  They are actually perfect apartment dogs because they don\u2019t have a ton of energy.  (That being said, I wouldn\u2019t want to live under one because they are heavy footed).  Mine slobbers a lot, so I would understand a landlord not wanting the slobber.  My lab growing up was much more destructive than any Dane I\u2019ve ever owned.\n\nMy larger concern would be cost.  Danes cost a lot of money to initially purchase.  Then on top of that everything is more expensive.  Heart worm and flea/tick prevention medicine is prescribed by weight.  So is any other medicine I\u2019ve had to buy.  The vet actually sends us to a human pharmacy anytime we need antibiotics because they don\u2019t have the right dosage.  They also tend to have a lot of joint problems as they age.  They are twice as expensive to board, etc.  in short it costs a ton more to own a Dane than small dogs.  Also, check with your homeowner\u2019s insurance - some companies do not insure certain breeds.  We had to change insurance when we got our current Dane.", "Yes, they are taking advantage of you. You need to do this OP or what next?", "\"They are leasing\" the property, that to me is why OP is YTA. Anything not spelled out in the lease agreement is not binding. They didn't mention a lease caveat of \"no new pet's without our permission\", or even \"no animals over 50 lbs.\" He's pulling the 'ol Darth Vader changing the agreement after the fact.", ">And a 4ft fence is useless in regards to a Great Dane.\n\nThis is simply not true.

Most areas have a limited number of dogs/cats and 3 dogs and 5 cats is actually over the limit in my area.", "This is codependency in action.", "That may not be a lie - I had to change my home insurance company when we got our Great Dane because my previous insurance did not cover that breed.", "They're receiving a house because he allowed them to when they were at their lowest... How is it not super entitled to then get a massive dog on top of the existing pets they already own when op is already helping them out with finances and a place to stay? They're overly entitled,when they should just be thankful for the opportunity to not be out on the street. I don't know why you would call op the ah for not assuming broke people would think to bring an additional cost (large dog) into his property that he was allowing them to live in? Why is he meant to be psychic to assume they're not smart enough to know they can't afford it and it's a bad idea?", "Yeah I\u2019ve been bitten by a Great Dane over a fence much higher that 4ft. That is merely a resting shelf for their convenience", "lol - my Dane will not even step over a broom.  Most Danes are not jumpers so a 4 foot fence is fine.

OP told NO on another dog & totally disregarded him wishes.", "And OP could easily raise all of those points as their relative. As their landlord he has very specific things he can and cannot do. He can't hold the property against them for not violating their lease. He can hold them responsible for damages, but stomping his foot and screaming \"no\" doesn't change his lease agreement.  \nThe parents may be foolish and bad with money and care of animals, but OP took on a legal role that is governed by law and contracts and now he want's to change that deal that he made without the consent of the other party. That's a dick move no matter what the reasoning.", "Agreed! I don't know why it's meant to be rocket science to understand if you are accepting charity from others that you can't then go and take out more expenses while pleading poverty! How does this even make sense?. And do they even understand how much more a great Dane would cost food wise? Disrespectful to op and Delusional.

OP as a son in law, all good. OP as a landlord with legal and contractual responsibilities changing the terms of that contract after the fact? AH.", "Accepting charity is one thing. Accepting charity with terms and conditions is another. The reason OP is an AH here is that he gave charity (good), with some terms and conditions (also good). Those terms and conditions were accepted, and per OP, have been entirely met. OP now want's to change those terms without giving the recipient the chance to consent."]}
