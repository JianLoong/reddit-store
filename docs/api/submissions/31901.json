But my adult Danes are actually the best house dogs. The tiny terrorists dogs are demons, digging up the flooring, digging up the yard, tearing into walls. And you do not even want to know about the cost of the electronics they have destroyed. My Dane is a doll baby compared to them. That being said you said NO .. your house your rules. If you do not have a written lease agreement.. it might be time you got one. With a pet damage agreement, maybe a bump in the rent to be put into savings to repair the inevitable pet damage. You also need to add in a pet limit, and if size is an issue add in a weight clause. \n   FYI the reason most people think Danes are destructive, is due to them having \u201cseparation anxiety\u201d but if they have multiple pets then that should not be an issue. \nThat being said NOBODY SHOULD GET A DANE, WHEN THEY KNOW THE LANDLORD SAID NO. This is why many of them end up being rehomed. Also if they have never had a BIG dog then I hope to heck they did their research. \n  Oh NTAH and the only one that is going to suffer is the poor dog", "That 4 ft fence certainly won\u2019t hold that dog in and you will have a dog at large. Perhaps you can talk to them about not being able to contain the dog", ">5 cats and 3 current dogs\n\nNTA They already had more pets than most landlords would allow. They were absurd to bring a 4th dog in the house. It's a shame you didn't cap the number of pets in the rental agreement to what they moved in with.", "NTA", "If you were just the landlord, N TA because it\u2019s your prerogative. \n\nAs a SIL, YTA. You didn\u2019t mention anything about them mistreating the house or any damage their animals have caused. Who cares how big or what breed the dog is? You don\u2019t live with them.  You should be caring more about the demeanor of the dog. Overall, giant dogs are more likely to be lazier and less destructive than small dogs. Butt out of their business and fine them to replace or fix things if they damage them. \n\nINFO: The other thing you didn\u2019t mention is how your partner feels about the situation and about what you said to their parents.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
