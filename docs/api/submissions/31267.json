I knew a couple who adopted a daughter from abroad and then realized they were expecting. They raised them practically as twins. They were inseparable, and the parents always treated them completely equally.\n\nYour sister is terrible for differentiating between the girls. It is only going to breed resentment between them. \n\nDon't destroy your relationship with Leah though. She may not understand why you're favoring her sister. And she may need you someday when she realizes that her mom is really unfair to her sister.", "NTA, she should've taken June, leaving her behind seems very fishy and maybe the reason behind that is because she's adopted? I think you're an amazing person for taking June with you, I hope you guys have a blast.  let your sister know how dividing between sister works now with Leah being angry and educate her about Karma.", "NTA \n\nI'm glad June has someone who loves her cos your sister doesn't seem to!", "NTA\n\nYour sister's attitude is so gross that I cannot stomach it.  Where was June while they were away.\n\nWas she left alone by herself at home??(fourteen is fair young for that).\n\nContinue to be there for June, your half-sister clearly is NOT,", "Good grief your sister is something else.  I think you're doing a lovely thing. NTA", "Thank you for existing for that child.", "As you, I, and everyone on reddit can tell, your sister is a dismal parent engaged in emotional abuse of June through her blatant favoring of her bio child.  \n\nMy thought is that if you want to gain custody of June, maybe talk with a lawyer and see if there's a way to make that happen.  June will be much better off with you.  If this isn't possible, keep up the informal arrangement, but document, document, document every single game to which you take June, every vacation she doesn't get taken on, etc. etc. etc.  In case you ever need more of a basis to try to get her away from your dreadful sister.\n\nAnd definitely take her on vacation!  Why on earth not?\n\nNTA\n\nP.S.  Who stayed with June when the rest of the family was on vacation?  If she was alone, get yourself to that lawyer as quickly as humanly possible.  That would be physical neglect and is completely intolerable.", "Your sister is a horrible mother and an abysmal human being. My heart goes out to June. How ridiculous is your brother in law to enable your sister? Is there no other family who can make her see some sense?", "NTA It seems now that your sister has a bio daughter she has no use for the one she adopted but she can\u2019t return it like she would a no longer wanted puppy. June is so lucky to have you in her corner!!!", "NTA. It sounds like your sister only has one daughter", "ESH. Unless solo birthday trips are a thing in general, meaning June would also get or have gotten one, what they\u2019re doing is mean. They adopted June, and even if they don\u2019t feel the same toward her, the least they can do is make sure the tangible things given to each child are on the same level. \n\nTrouble is I don\u2019t think you\u2019re helping here. You don\u2019t seem to have a problem being unfair to Leah, and while I know you mean it as a kindness to June, she won\u2019t even get that trip if her parents decide against it, and you\u2019ve created more friction in their home, which won\u2019t help her in the long run. \n\nIt would have been better to speak with your sister and tell her something like \u201cHey, if you do a trip with just one of the girls, I\u2019d be happy to take the other one for the week and we\u2019ll have some treat days. Let me know when you do June\u2019s birthday trip and Leah can stay with me\u201d.  I think we all know there isn\u2019t a trip planned for June, but something like that could have pointed out the unfairness without putting your sister on the defensive.", "I understand your worry: you don't want to further a wedge between the sisters, on top of what their parents are already creating.\nA lot depends on the relationship between the sisters. Is the younger one affectionate or spoiled and entitled?\nIf you know they have a good relationship you should take them both.\nBy the way, their parents are appalling", "Leah hasn't done anything wrong, so if she were older it might be different... but as she is only 2.. nta", "NTA - as an adopted child I can say for a fact that we know who loves us as their own. Uour sister reminds me of one of my sets of parents (my mom and dad divorced when I was 6m). I know one set loves me as thier own but the other set I think just saw me as money as that set of parents had custody and did everything to keep me from them but never actually showed any feelings when something happened and even shipped my off as a teen so they could be child free instead of asking the non custodial set of parents to take me because they didn't want to lose their child support...", "NTA but the likely outcome of this is your sister forbidding June from going on the trip.", "Adopting a child and then not (emotionally) caring for it is so terrible, please continue to support June! I\u2018m sure she deserves a nice trip, even though the fanciness could never make up for the inevitable long term  psychological hurt from the abandonment/rejection of the parents", "Nta", "NTA - As an adopted person this breaks my heart so much. No-one should differentiate between bio and adopted kids, they are both your children.\nHave lots of fun with June. At that age, she'll have put two and two together and realised what the deal is. Make her feel a part of your family.", "This is a fair point.  Obviously you shouldn't kidnap June without her mother's consent.", "Well found the sister!\n\nHonestly, she is just trying to comfort a little girl who has been the black sheep of the family. Honestly what the sister did was done right unfair and Opie is just trying to make it right by giving the other daughter a chance to experience same situations just with a better outcome if I may say.
