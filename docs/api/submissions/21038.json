From the sounds of it, you know Emily and/or her parents and they all would have been under their guardianship for the one night. Is that not enough assurance?", "Sorry, YTA. It's a bit much to expect to know everyone attending the sleepover of a 14 year old. The host and their family should be sufficient. Still, if it's a stickler for you then invite the kid over so you can meet him.\n\nETA: I'm sorry OP but you have a lot of unprocessed trauma and it's playing a huge part in your decision making here. I urge you to discuss this with a professional. It seems that there's nothing this boy can do that will prevent you from seeing him as an inherent threat and that's an incredibly unhealthy mindset to maintain.", "INFO. You presumably know Emily\u2019s parents\u2026.ask them if they\u2019ve met Jack and /or his parents.    And /or maybe ask Emily if you can be there early and stay, until Jack is dropped off\u2026so you can meet them all then, and ascertain your vibe.", "yta,... if your daughter feels safe with jack around, why is there an issue. What are you protecting her from.... a good time? \n\nYour daughter is in far more danger from someone you know and already trust (statistically speaking)", "I was going to say no cuz if the rule is meeting the parents first then it would be an easy solution to meet him and his parents\u2026 but YTA like the way you said it at the end says you\u2019re saying no because he\u2019s a boy? But he\u2019s gay? Shouldn\u2019t him being a boy only matter if he\u2019s going to do soemthing to them? Is the problem that he\u2019s a boy or you never met him? just meet him?", "YTA because in the updates you say even if you met him that you\u2019d still not be ok. So really you\u2019re fishing for excuses to validate a decision you already made. If you do, then you\u2019re teaching your daughter to lie to you. Because next time she\u2019ll just not tell you he\u2019s going to be there. Consider your future relationship with your daughter as you make this decision, you have very few years left of influence. Meet the kid. Trust the host parents. Trust your daughter. Show her you trust and value her. This is not the hill to die on.", "Soft YTA\n\nCoed sleepovers are extremely common with teens these days.  They are generally good, clean fun.  And actually, current teens are less likely to be having sex than teens in previous generations.\n\nIt would be better to let your daughter know that she shouldn't be drinking, doing drugs, having sex, and that she can call you any time she needs a ride.  This way, she can have a bit of independence and start making age appropriate decisions about her social interactions.", "YTA.\n\nWhat's the point in getting to know parents if you don't trust their judgement? They're letting Jack stay. You said you've met them and trust them.\n\nClearly, you don't. You're super controlling, OP. You clearly don't trust the girl's parents (the one whose house the sleepover is at), so what's the point in meeting Jack's?\n\nYou just don't want your daughter around a booooooy, god forbid.", "If it helps, aged 14/15 we would have mixed sleepovers and it didn't lead to issues.  And a boy who's come out as gay age 15 and face all that entails is probably somewhat more emotionally literate than many other boys.", "YTA, and you have unreasonable expectations your daughter will end up resenting you for or she'll simply start lying to you to avoid it. This is not how you keep girls safe.", "YTA. You're lying to yourself that your concern is with your daughter's safety, and you haven't given any evidence of danger. This boy is known to all the others as well as the hosting parents. You have no leg to stand on, here.", "YTA. You\u2019re biggest reason is because you think he might rape her. You know women can rape too right? There are sadly many cases of girls being abused my female friends and family members. Who\u2019s to say one of the other girls at the party won\u2019t get too friendly. You\u2019ve also commented that if she was 16 you\u2019d be ok with it. You do know there\u2019s no age limit on rape. She could be 40 and get raped. You\u2019re projecting what happened to you on your daughter. She\u2019s going to resent you.\n\nEDIT: Also what about other men in the house? Does the girl have a brother? Yeah he\u2019s not sleeping the room but could easily sneak in. Same with the father. And before you say oh I\u2019ve met the father he\u2019s a great guy and wouldn\u2019t do that, look into how many rape cases start out with that. Where does the paranoia end?", "YTA. Just contact his parents and meet them?", "I\u2019m going to go with an understandable and soft YTA. You are naturally going to be protective of your daughter and this situation is going to be a stressful one for you. You are correct in that there is a degree of risk with anything like this but countering that is that there are multiple other girls in the room. Is Jack likely to try anything on at that age in front of a room of witnesses (with consent or without). \n\nMy other thought you need to consider here is that this is a formative experience for your daughter- these types of events allow her to learn to judge situations later in life.\n\nI understand your reticence but also you need to consider the possibility that this may be positive.", "YTA\nIf you know the parents of the girl where the sleepover is and they allow it. It should be ok for you too.\n\nOtherwise you can ask your dauther to meet with Jack and his parents up front.\n\nBut you just refuse without giving a solution.", "NTA\nPeople saying it's because hes gay dont have any evidence, and people acting like the fact that hes gay negates the worries cause theres no chance anything will happen as with that logic would a lesbian no longer be allowed to be in the same room in case something were to happen, or a gay boy in a all boys sleep over or a bisexual in any sleep overs, in case something were to happen.\nTheres a thought process of boys are different and should be kept separate from girls when it comes to things like sharing a room. It's why brothers and sisters aren't meant to share a room but two brothers of the same age gap are fine to, it's not just something might happen. Plus sexualities are very fluid around that age, kids are still figuring themselves out, and just because hes not attracted to them, theres a chance they could be attracted to him.\n\nPersonally I'd suggest meeting him, his parents, seeing where it goes from there giving it a fair shot and seeing if there's any compromise or even after talking it out If your fears die out or they see where your coming from", "Soft YTA. I get where you're coming from, but as long as they're all sleeping in the same room, it's pretty unlikely that sexual shenanigans are going to occur. Why not just call and introduce yourself to Jack's parents. The same way you would if she mentioned a new female friend would be attending.", "NTA. Seems many on here have the mindset of a teenager. And the comment that teenagers now aren't having sex as much as older generations... LMAO...really?!\n\nI think you need to get to know this young man, then form your opinion. It's your job to be her parent, not bow to cultural norms.", "Teenagers are always 100% truthful about everything and you have no reason to worry about anything at all. NTA. Everybody has different rules about what they let their children do and not do. Stick by your rules. Do what you think is in the best interest of your child. Nobody else is responsible for or will have to deal with the consequences of any decisions your 14 year old makes.", "yta, i had coed sleepovers with friends as a kid (yes at 14) with my closest friend (at the time our sexualities/gender identities would have made us a \u201cmatch\u201d of sorts). we would even share a bed together. my parents were okay with it because they trusted me. they trusted me to respect myself and not do anything i didn\u2019t want to do, they respected me for knowing i knew how to speak up if something unsavory happened, and they chose to meet the friend beforehand so they could trust them as well. \nas other people have pointed out, you say things would be different if you knew him or his parents, yet your comments clearly contradict that. \ndo you trust your own kid? do you think she can keep herself safe? do you think a gay kid is going to make a move on her despite his sexuality because he\u2019s \u201ca teenage boy\u201d? sure of course the last one is a possibility, anything can happen, but it sounds like she trusts him enough to know he wouldn\u2019t do that. \nmaybe try listening to your kid", "NTA.

That would be my first step in making this decision.", "Small YTA. On the surface: the rule to meet the kid or the parents is a good one, because that means you are actively parenting, and you 'might' get a feel for what kind of people/behaviors to expect. In REALITY you are only getting a SNAPSHOT of who they are in that moment - people do *present themselves differently when on the spot*, and kids behavior does change over time.  Your 'meeting the parents', is just giving you a false sense of security and does NOT truly impart any knowledge or control over how these kids will behave in the absence of supervision. This really comes down to your OWN child's behavior/maturity/choices. If your daughter knows your expectations and has the strength of character/maturity to make the right choices etc, etc, then that should be larger issue. The other big one is the HOSTING parent's rules and supervision plans. Their proximity & rules will have more effect/control than you having met these kids once or twice before.", "Have you talked to the parents of the other girls?
