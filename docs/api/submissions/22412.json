I'm not opposed to the idea but I want to do so when I'm ready. \n\nCut to present, he recently tried to set me up with one of his friends. I told him I'd be open but wasn't super interested to which he'd reply\"Oh you're just making excuses\" and \"So what you just want to alone for the rest of your life\". I finally said yes because the girl was cute and thought why not. \n\nLeading up towards the date he constantly messages me asking if I messaged her yet, asking what we were doing for the date then criticizing my choices. On the day of the date he kept being like \"what if I just showed up to the coffee place\" and THEN HE ENDED UP SHOWING UP. It was super weird and I felt pretty pressuesd. \n\nAfter the date we said goodbye she messaged hey I had a good time and I messaged back that I had a good time too. She was nice but I wasn't looking to pursue further. Neither of us messaged eachother anything after that.\n\nMy friend pushed me to go on a second date to which I said I wasn't interested in. He kept saying \"you need to get out of your comfort zone\" \"just go on a second date for the heck of it\". Then he finally said \"okay message her that you don't want to see her again.\" I said this was kinda presumptious since she hadn't asked for a second date and may not even  want another. \n\nSo we get into this argument where he gets upset that I don't send a rejection message and kept being like \"Wow man so you're just going to ghost her??\" \"wow dude she's my friend, you started this now finish it\". \n\nI was just upset about how involved he was jn this whole process. He acted like I was getting mad at him for \"just trying to push someone out of their comfortzone\" but it wasn't that at all. \n\nAnyway I felt bad for overreacting and maybe not being clear with that girl but the whole thing felt like it had too many cooks involved and that my friend wasn't advocating in my interests.", "created_utc": 1689526115, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151b1uv/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_friend_for_setting_me/", "score": 169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you think after a first date a rejection text is necessary if no one had asked for a second date. He kept making a big deal that I was ghosting her and that it was my responsible to let her know. \n\nBut I also didn't want to send a random text rejecting her when for all I knew she wouldn't want another date at all.", "No, I personally don't reach out if I don't see a second date happening. If he texts me and asks for one, that's when I have to have the dreaded rejection convo. I'd leave it alone unless she texts you.", "If he cares so much he could ask her himself, but as adults its pretty clear if neither reached out again and there are no hard feelings then it just didn't click and thats that", "I'm with you. It's not ghosting someone if that person also didn't make any effort to reach out again after the date. Sending a message telling someone you don't want a second date when they didn't ask for one and didn't even send you any more messages after the date would be rude and super presumptuous in my opinion.", "NTA - maybe ask your friend why he's so invested and with this friend of his? Why is he pushing, did she ask him to?\n\nThere's more to this I'm thinking.", "NTA maybe you should ghost your friend", "NTA that's not even ghosting lol it's not like she reached out to ask about a date. You're taking her lead and replying in kind.\n\nIf you do reach out I would specifically be like \"Hey again had a great time, but (friend) is saying (all of this shit he's saying). Just wanted to let you know that there's no ill will and I did have a good time, in case you're hearing conflicting stuff from him.\" Like if he's gonna act like this is his problem he's 1) probably already talking shit about you to people 2) you mind as well make it fully his problem and expose all the weird stuff he's implying about her and you. That would be a way of you you finishing it lol.", "I don't think he's a friend. Who on earth shows up to third wheel a date ?? NTA", "NTA-This whole situation with him is super weird and creepy. I\u2019d distance myself from him from here. If he feels like you\u2019re ghosting her, you could simply say to her \u201c____ thinks me not letting sending you a rejection is rude, I want you to know you\u2019re nice and pleasant, but I don\u2019t see a future with us. Good luck on your venture.\u201d I think this shows her that you\u2019re not an arsehole and doesn\u2019t allow him to create a narrative with her about you. \n\nGood luck in your self growth!", "NTA he\u2019s a weirdo\n\nHe sounds like one of those needy people who can\u2019t function outside of the context of a relationship and therefore can\u2019t fathom that not everyone dislikes being single.", "A part from being invested in my dating life, this girl he set me up with is also friends with this other girl he has a crush on. \n\nSo I'm also guessing him setting me up with a way to get closer with this girl and have more to talk about idk.", "Your mistake was ever allowing the discussion of a date. That allowed the nose of the camel under the tent (if that metaphor makes no sense, see the link at the bottom).\n\nHe went from discussing it, to coercing you into a first date, to being at the first date, to now wanting to manage you into a second date. You gave him an inch, he's taken a mile. It's why such sayings exist.\n\nIt's a lesson in the need to establish very firm boundaries and ruthlessly enforce them with pushy people. You need to tell him to fuck off, but you'd be in far less of a pickle had you told him to butt out in the beginning.\n\nIt's always easiest to say \"no\", and mean it, at the earliest stage to things that make you uncomfortable. Your life will be so much easier if you learn this lesson.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel%27s\\_nose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel%27s_nose)", "Okay, that explains it. Just tell him to date the girl he likes and leave you out of it. \n\nWing man or not, explain to him, you're just not into her. There's a book AND a movie about it LOL\n\nGetting out of your comfort zone is one thing, and yes, it's a good thing to do, but it's your boundaries to push, not his.", "I don't think this should be considered a date if he was there--unless you were dating him too? (kinda creepy)\n\nNTA I guess.  Tho it's likely that she would originally have been expecting you to make next move--it is still more often man who asks for first few dates than women.  \n\nThis doesn't really seem like a good friend, he seems to think he's Dolly Levi or Budget Patty Stanger.  Pushing you into something you don't want to do isn't going to make you suddenly want it.", "NTA, and this is not a friend.", "Message him that you don't want to see him again. You're fine being alone if it means that no one is nagging you to do things you don't want to do.\n\nNTA... unless you continue to let him bully you like this.", "You were fine, your friend is no friend and a jerk.  In the future, do not give him information about a future date.  Tell him you have it covered.", "NTA. OP, have you ever thought you might be aromantic/asexual? I am myself and this sounds a lot like me. Of course, you could just not be interested in dating, and that\u2019s fine too.", "They are the A. Are you a servant of Rome? You can live a life of abstinence and celibacy if you like.", "Nta, your friend is being a dick. He has no right to push you out of what he perceives to be your comfort zone, and showing up for your date was deeply creepy and fucked up. Set Boundaries", "The sad part, is she's cute(according to OP) and OP appears to have found her pleasant, If she had shown interest, OP may have had enough reciprocal interest to have a 2 person date instead of 3 person encounter.", "Yeah he didn't stay for the whole thing but definitely showed his face in there and looked around and acted like it was some big joke. \n\nAnd yeah I agree she may have been expecting me to make the next move but I also thought she might not have been into it either so easier to just let it rest/fade out unless someone asks for a second date.", "I've thought of it but not really because I've dated alot in the past. I just think I'm older/in a period of life where dating doesn't have that aura of wonder and mystique than when I was younger. So I'm less motivated by dating just to date. \n\nI know what I want now and am not just looking for hookups, so I'm alot more selective. So maybe it looks like I'm less interested in dating when I'm just waiting for a person that I vibe with if that makes sense.", "In the future, a good idea is to text something like \u201chey, it was a nice time, but I don\u2019t see it going anywhere. Best of luck!\u201d That way it\u2019s clear and there\u2019s no awkwardness.", "No. As a female, I would find that weird and uncomfortable. Just let it be. And you never know. Sometimes you might see each other later at a party and want to pursue things further than if you click then. No need to make things final and cause awkward feelings when it\u2019s not needed. If you were in a relationship, that\u2019s one thing. But you just met up once. A text could only cause harm at this point unless she texts you.", "That makes perfect sense! I just wasn\u2019t sure if you had thought about it before. Maturity definitely has a lot to do with it for everyone I think.", "Thank you for that rabbit Hole LOL\n\nI was disappointed to not have a visual image on Wiki to go with it.  \nBecause I can so see a camel sticking it's nose under the tent edge(and bringing it down as it lifts it's head up).  \n\nI wish I could draw....", "NTA he's being incredibly creepy, rude and disrespectful. Tell him to knock it off and leave you alone. Let him k ow how creepy and unsettling his behavior is. If she was interested, she'd text you", "NTA.\n\nHe's disturbingly insistent.", "NTA. He needs to back off. And it\u2019s not ghosting if neither party reaches out for a second date.", "YTA. send her a proper message if you are not interested.", "NTA.\n\nMy question is why are you still friends with this person? You made your views known and you let them bully you? Ask him how your choices factor into his life because they don't.", "NTA. Maybe I've been on reddit too much lately. But are you sure he isn't trying to figure out how to date you? Because I can't figure out why else for this incredibly bizarre behaviour.", "Couldn't you also say she's being an asshole for not asking me out again or sending me a message that she's not interested? \n\nOr because I'm the guy are you saying I gotta make it clear?\n\nI'm just worried about being a dick or presumptious if I reject her or deny a second date that wasn't even planned.", "If neither of you said anything about wanting a second date, or getting together again, or anything like that, then that\u2019s that. You didn\u2019t call her and she didn\u2019t call you, so it\u2019s a big stretch IMO to say that either of you ghosted the other. Nobody is ignoring contact from anyone, other than you trying to ignore your pushy meddling friend. And he\u2019s bringing that on himself.", "It\u2019s super not necessary when you are reading the situation correctly, as you have. Your friend is a psycho. Is he into you?", "i think if you are not interested, you should tell them so there are no expectations.  it is just a proper thing to do.  would you rather she contacted you and you proceed to reject her?  you mistake was going out with her in the first place.  clean up your mess.", "Honestly, I disagree.  Things worked perfectly in this case - neither party was interested in round two, so they left things on a high note and went back to their lives in peace.  They both know where the other is at without another word being said.", "Yeah I don't neccessarily think your wrong. But I'd also rather not contact her just to reject her for a date she never even asked for which could be rude or awkward. But yeah being clear even if it's more direct is probably best overall.", "what?  don\u2019t contact her to reject her, what are you talking about?  no, you thank her for the good time, then you tell her you are not up for a relationship.  all honest truth.  are you okay?", "No lol that's what my friend is telling me to message her. \"I don't want to go on a second date\". \n\nWe already texted eachother \"hey had a good time\" and I said \"hey had a good time too get home safe\". And nothing was said after that so I feel just sending her a oh btw don't want to date is a bit much. Isn't neither of us saying anything further jndicactive thay no one wants a second date?\n\nI'm okay dude lol, just figuring out the best course of action here since people have alot of differing opnions."]}
