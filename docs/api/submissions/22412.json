I'm not opposed to the idea but I want to do so when I'm ready. \n\nCut to present, he recently tried to set me up with one of his friends. I told him I'd be open but wasn't super interested to which he'd reply\"Oh you're just making excuses\" and \"So what you just want to alone for the rest of your life\". I finally said yes because the girl was cute and thought why not. \n\nLeading up towards the date he constantly messages me asking if I messaged her yet, asking what we were doing for the date then criticizing my choices. On the day of the date he kept being like \"what if I just showed up to the coffee place\" and THEN HE ENDED UP SHOWING UP. It was super weird and I felt pretty pressuesd. \n\nAfter the date we said goodbye she messaged hey I had a good time and I messaged back that I had a good time too. She was nice but I wasn't looking to pursue further. Neither of us messaged eachother anything after that.\n\nMy friend pushed me to go on a second date to which I said I wasn't interested in. He kept saying \"you need to get out of your comfort zone\" \"just go on a second date for the heck of it\". Then he finally said \"okay message her that you don't want to see her again.\" I said this was kinda presumptious since she hadn't asked for a second date and may not even  want another. \n\nSo we get into this argument where he gets upset that I don't send a rejection message and kept being like \"Wow man so you're just going to ghost her??\" \"wow dude she's my friend, you started this now finish it\". \n\nI was just upset about how involved he was jn this whole process. He acted like I was getting mad at him for \"just trying to push someone out of their comfortzone\" but it wasn't that at all. \n\nAnyway I felt bad for overreacting and maybe not being clear with that girl but the whole thing felt like it had too many cooks involved and that my friend wasn't advocating in my interests.", "created_utc": 1689526115, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151b1uv/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_friend_for_setting_me/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you think after a first date a rejection text is necessary if no one had asked for a second date. He kept making a big deal that I was ghosting her and that it was my responsible to let her know. \n\nBut I also didn't want to sand a random text rejecting her when for all I knew she want another date at all.", "No, I personally don't reach out if I don't see a second date happening. If he texts me and asks for one, that's when I have to have the dreaded rejection convo. I'd leave it alone unless she texts you.", "If he cares so much he could ask her himself, but as adults its pretty clear if neither reached out again and there are no hard feelings then it just didn't click and thats that", "I'm with you. It's not ghosting someone if that person also didn't make any effort to reach out again after the date. Sending a message telling someone you don't want a second date when they didn't ask for one and didn't even send you any more messages after the date would be rude and super presumptuous in my opinion.", "NTA - maybe ask your friend why he's so invested and with this friend of his? Why is he pushing, did she ask him to?\n\nThere's more to this I'm thinking.", "NTA maybe you should ghost your friend", "NTA that's not even ghosting lol it's not like she reached out to ask about a date. You're taking her lead and replying in kind.\n\nIf you do reach out I would specifically be like \"Hey again had a great time, but (friend) is saying (all of this shit he's saying). Just wanted to let you know that there's no ill will and I did have a good time, in case you're hearing conflicting stuff from him.\" Like if he's gonna act like this is his problem he's 1) probably already talking shit about you to people 2) you mind as well make it fully his problem and expose all the weird stuff he's implying about her and you. That would be a way of you you finishing it lol.", "I don't think he's a friend. Who on earth shows up to third wheel a date ?? NTA", "NTA-This whole situation with him is super weird and creepy. I\u2019d distance myself from him from here. If he feels like you\u2019re ghosting her, you could simply say to her \u201c____ thinks me not letting sending you a rejection is rude, I want you to know you\u2019re nice and pleasant, but I don\u2019t see a future with us. Good luck on your venture.\u201d I think this shows her that you\u2019re not an arsehole and doesn\u2019t allow him to create a narrative with her about you. \n\nGood luck in your self growth!", "NTA he\u2019s a weirdo\n\nHe sounds like one of those needy people who can\u2019t function outside of the context of a relationship and therefore can\u2019t fathom that not everyone dislikes being single.", "A part from being invested in my dating life, this girl he set me up with is also friends with this other girl he has a crush on. \n\nSo I'm also guessing him setting me up with a way to get closer with this girl and have more to talk about idk.", "Your mistake was ever allowing the discussion of a date. That allowed the nose of the camel under the tent (if that metaphor makes no sense, see the link at the bottom).\n\nHe went from discussing it, to coercing you into a first date, to being at the first date, to now wanting to manage you into a second date. You gave him an inch, he's taken a mile. It's why such sayings exist.\n\nIt's a lesson in the need to establish very firm boundaries and ruthlessly enforce them with pushy people. You need to tell him to fuck off, but you'd be in far less of a pickle had you told him to butt out in the beginning.\n\nIt's always easiest to say \"no\", and mean it, at the earliest stage to things that make you uncomfortable. Your life will be so much easier if you learn this lesson.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel%27s\\_nose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel%27s_nose)", "Okay, that explains it. Just tell him to date the girl he likes and leave you out of it. \n\nWing man or not, explain to him, you're just not into her. There's a book AND a movie about it LOL\n\nGetting out of your comfort zone is one thing, and yes, it's a good thing to do, but it's your boundaries to push, not his."]}
