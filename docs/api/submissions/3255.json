And the fact that telling people IRL makes people think he is awful not to mention quite, quite controlling? And his response is to have you keep it a secret? And everyone here will agree with that IRL verdict. Your bf wants to control you, even retroactively, and punish you for your previous autonomy with the extreme, protracted tattoo removals, or since he can\u2019t quite talk you into that one, at least make you get one you hate, to show his ownership of you. Is anything about him good enough to make this ok?", "OP, there is a third option here and it is the best option: Dump him and run. You are aware you have bodily autonomy correct? Your body is YOURS and yours alone. He has absolutely no say as to what you can and cannot do with it, much less force you to do something you don\u2019t want to do. If he is controlling of your body, what else is he controlling about? Could be micro incidents that you never thought were controlling but were also big red flags like this situation here. You deserve better. Get out while you still can.", "Oh ffs. Why are you with someone like this? Dump him, set the bar higher and expect better.", "NTA\n\nthis is a great opportunity to initiate your first adult breakup. NOBODY gets to tell you what to do with your body.", "YTA, you\u2019re spineless.", "Wtf??", "Baby no. NTA for not wanting to remove your tattoos, but YWBTA to yourself if you stay with this clown.", "What the fuck?", "Get a new boyfriend and a tattoo of your choosing", "RUN", "The only option here is to keep your tattoos and dignity and dump the asshole.", "Enjoy your branding \ud83d\ude44", "So, option 1 is that he gets to control what is on your body and option 2 is that he gets to control what is on your body. Do you see a pattern here? NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s all about him wanting to control your body. He probably wants you to get the tattoo so he can leave a permanent mark on you. Fuck that guy.", "Oh you could do so much better than this. Dump him. Dump him like yesterday. Can you imagine what your life is going to be like going forward? What if you got pregnant with this guy? He is going to micromanage everything that happens to your body. Just Dump the whole man. The only way you'd be TA is if you're not closing Reddit right now to text him that it's over.", "Bf just wants to brand op.\n\nDon't get the tattoo op!! What will he ask of you next!", "I commented before I even read the whole post. Do NOT let that man choose/pay for a tattoo for you. This is a sickening manipulation and control tactic.", "I mean, it isn\u2019t about liking them, because he is happy to have her get another one of his choosing, sounds like branding to me. This is just a controlling psycho. Dump this ass.", "Because then he can \u201cmark her as his\u201d", "Quick hijack for OP\n\nHi OP\nlooks like you are having trouble with your \"partner\" and some of his abusive tendencies have crossed a line that you can't let go.\n You are not crazy you are not wrong you are 9 times out of 10 not at fault. You might just not have known you are in a relationship with an abuser. They often use incremental changes to get what they want slowly and so that you are less likely to notice. \nThe Book \"why does he do that\" by Lundy Bancroft (free copy below) is a great resource for you to learn about the different types of tactics that abusers use and will help you to see if your current relationship is following any of the patterns described.\n If you don't see your relationship being discussed either as one of the architypes or as bits and pieces of any of the other types then you're not worse off by having the knowledge.  If the information does coincide with the way that you're living then there's also a couple chapters on being able to get out safely.\n I wish you the best of luck and I want you to know that you deserve to be with a partner who is going to love you and cherish you and treat you as an equal versus being with someone who's gonna control you be it by how you dress or by finances or by What it is that you can do or who you can see. You deserve so much BETTER we're here rooting for you!\n\n\nhttps://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf", "Yeah, I\u2019m very fucking glad I didn\u2019t stay with the guy I dated at 21.  It would have ruined my life.  Hopefully this OP will look back on this relationship the same way.", "Ding ding!  She has to show her that he owns her body one way or another. Gross.", "100% this", "It\u2019s probably \u201cproperty of X\u201d or some bullshit like that.", "This needs more attention", "I didn't see the design the partner wants."]}
