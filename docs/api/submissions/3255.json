We're being made to believe that it's innocuous. The conceit of the AITA question is that the OP supposedly does their best to frame the question as objectively as possible, so even in very clear cases like this one, OPs often present evidence to \"balance\" perspective. In this case: the boyfriend concedes the proposal to remove all the other tattoos by suggesting a different, small innocuous tattoo in a hidden location.\n\nNow, if you remove the bodily autonomy and emotional abuse questions (which we shouldn't, but often people in abusive situations tend to do this), then the question is: lose all of her tattoos vs. get a new one.\n\nBoiled down simply like that, most of us would go for option number two, there would be no doubt. Given that the OP is so emotionally trapped that she's even considering this, my question is: why is there doubt? Is it because the tattoo itself is not innocuous? Is it a symbol of a hate group directly above the genitals for example? Hidden, no one but the boyfriend will see it, but if she breaks up with him, she is unlikely to find another partner who will tolerate it, so she will run back to him?\n\nOr maybe I'm just being nosy."]}
