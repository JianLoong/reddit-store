Tell him you choose the tattoos.  Goodbye and have a nice life.", "NTA\n\nHis demands are weird as hell. He's being worryingly controlling. Is he like this about other things?\n\nThis early in a relationship, making major demands about you changing your body to suit his tastes is a worrying sign. Be prepared for him to escalate if you go ahead with this.", "NTA. Don't pick either of his options. Dump him. Screw him for telling you what to do with your body. From what you posted, he sounds controlling.", "NTA. Dump the walking dumpster fire.", "I think you do need removal\u2026 not of the tattoos but of the boyfriend!", "Seconding this, your BF sounds controlling af. If he doesn\u2019t like tattoos, dump him so he can find someone that also doesn\u2019t like them. But demanding that you either remove them all (at considerable pain and expense) or get one of his choosing is gross and coercive. Your body, your choice.

Limbs? Life? Perhaps I'm being dramatic but I wouldn't want to find out.", "I want to give you like 50 votes and all sorts of things for this comment.   \n100% agree..  RUN!!!\n\nOh yeah..

It's either remove all of her previous \"markings\" or allow her to keep them, but he gets to leave a \"mark\" of his own.

Either way it's him gaining control over her body"]}
