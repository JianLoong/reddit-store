OP Is TAH not only for the pole, but for berating a teenager for legally parking in a place she has as much right to as him.

I'm assuming it was between the curb and the car.... on the street itself?\nHow close to her car?\n\nHalf the door? It is convenient that you made it short enough that it wouldn't be seen by her getting into her car from the other side....... combined with the ski mask, I'd say it was absolutely malicious. There is no way to deny that........  and you are lucky you haven't been charged yet, but hopefully, that's coming soon.", "An unspoken agreement is not an agreement.

After all I perfectly hid my identity by wearing a skimask, probably while wearing clothes I own and walking to and from my front door. And of course there would never be a paper trail of the purchases I made, even if I went to a big box and paid cash, there would be no cameras with images of me, especially if I wore my Clark Brand Ski Mask what makes me unidentifiable!\n\n-OP, Probably"]}
