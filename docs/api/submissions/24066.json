You don\u2019t own the street.", "YTA. You may have had an agreement with the neighbors but that was before the daughter got a car. Now the situation has changed so if the street isnt a part of your property, then technically, she has as much right to park as you do. Either one of you could walk the 2 minutes but youre expecting her to. Thats not right if its not your street spot. It sucks but parking is first come, first serve in public spaces.", "You installed a road hazard in a public RIGHT OF WAY.", "~~I-N-F-O~~ (Updated - see below)\n\n* What was the purpose of installing the pole? You said in a comment \"*it wasn't to prevent someone from parking*\". OK, then, if that wasn't the reason, then what was? Be specific.\n* Was the pole installed on your property? If it was on public land, did you have a permit for installing it?\n* Why did you wear a ski mask while installing it?\n\nI suspect I already know what your answers will be, but I'm giving you the opportunity to defend your actions in a way that doesn't make you look like the asshole. Because right now, it's not looking promising.\n\nUPDATE: in the light of OP's answers below, my verdict is now **YTA**, because:\n\n* OP initially said \"No reason\", and then came up with a pathetically implausible one which isn't consistent with his comment elsewhere that the pole was temporary. It is very obvious OP installed the pole in the hope that the young woman would damage her car, and she did. He planned it all, and it went exactly as he planned.\n* It was on public land, so he had no right to install it.\n* He wore the ski mask to avoid being identified, so he knew he was doing something wrong.\n\nYou are a malicious asshole, OP.

If the neighbours agreed to this, it's common courtesy to follow it. \n\nYou can't just install a pole on public property.
