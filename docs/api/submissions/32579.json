I do get that emotional reaction because a lot of parents have it, and it's very understandable when the kids are little and you realize that means you will probably miss out on 50% of their big milestones too.  But you shouldn't lose out on all your time with the kids because she wants to keep the status quo without you in the same home.  That's not how it works.  You deserve time to parent your kids, and your kids deserve that time to bond with you as a parent. \n\nReally, the only thing that matters here is *what is best for the kids*.  And it's widely recognized that what is best for children is as equal a split in time between parents as possible because that encourages them to form strong, healthy bonds with both parents and encourages both parents to be active presences in the children's lives.  Take childcare or what she does on her time out of the equation.  Her time is no longer your concern unless what's happening during it negatively impacts the kids.  Your concern should be what's best for the kids AND being able to be an active, present father in your children's lives.  And that's almost assuredly 50/50 custody.", "She\u2019s going to be in for a rude awakening when the family court judge laughs at her claims that she\u2019s a SAHM when her kids go to daycare 4 days a week.  The courts have largely progressed to expect 50/50 between 2 competent caring adults.  She may be realizing she won\u2019t live as comfortably on support calculated on a 50/50 basis.  But, OP, you need to get an attorney in your area who has strong experience in YOUR jurisdiction\u2019s family court.  As the sole breadwinner, you will likely be on the hook for a hefty amount of both spousal and child support depending on where you live and the prevailing attitudes of the judge/ magistrate that oversees your family court.  In theory, she has a weak case (as compared to traditional SAHM) as primary caregiver if the kids are going to daycare most of the week.  You need to do all you can make sure you know the names of their doctors, daycare workers, playgroups etc.  and are considered by outsiders as a hands-on dad.  What you want is for the judge to determine she can work, but elects not to, while also not providing the majority of care for the kids that most SAHMs would\u2026so they will not hold the kids young ages and your job against you in deciding the best interest of the kids.", "NTA\n\n50/50 is what parents should do.  As long as there is no abuse, kids need mom and dad.  Of course, since she sounds like she is just after money, I would request to the court, since you both have the children equally, you ask for no support either direction, you pay when they are with you and she pays when they are with her, and you both split the medical.  Especially since she is the one who left you.", "During your week are you willing/capable of being the default parent?  Like if the daycare calls immediately leave work to pick up the kiddo?  If a kid is sick take time off work until they are better?  Arrange time off for appointments and such?  \n\nIf the answer is yes then go for it.\n\nSome people are all for 50/50 parenting until they realize how much work they will have to miss. It\u2019s common for every bit of sick and vacation time to go to kid illnesses/emergencies.", "I.N.F.O. NTA\n\nOutside of context 50/50 should be the expectation. You're both parents, you both have equal right to custody. But in specific context it's often a story of one parent doing a lot more for the kids and being a lot more directly involved, especially when one parent is designated as the primary caretaker like a SAHP. \n\nHow was childcare and time with the kids split before the separation? Are you both equally informed on things like school enrollment, medical appointments and needs, extracurricular activities. Do you know your kids' fried groups? When was the last time you did something just you & the kids?", "There isn't anything wrong with splitting custody like that.   As you describe it, it doesn't appear that Mom is particularly adept at caring for the kids if she's putting them in daycare for her mental health.  not going to claim that having 2 kids+home isn't taxing,  but she seems to be ... a lot.     \n\nSorry you are going through this.  Document, get a lawyer, and don't feel bad for asserting your rights.  \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nShe will have to get a job to support herself and the kids on her time and hopefully you can agree on a childcare center that works for your kids while they're young so they can have stability and a routine across both homes. 50/50 is the default in most states, regardless of who provided primary care during the relationship. Best of luck to you and your kids.", "NTA  You need to lawyer up and get a court ordered custody arrangement!", "NTA - if you're a decent parent, fight for your kids. Just because she's the mom doesn't make her a better parent.", "Based on the info given, NTA\n\nIt's hard enough for kids when parents split & 50/50 parenting can both reassure & help kids adjust.", "NTA. You want 50/50 with your kids while they're little and that should not be taken from you. If you can afford to, you might offer to cover the cost of a trade school or some such for your wife, so she can transition into a work life if she has been lamenting that she does not have a skill. But if she is set on being a SAHM who's kids are in daycare to give her a break, then that's not going to help.", "NTA, go be a dad!", "Right of first refusal, please ensure you have that in the agreement. Will save a lot of time and headache. Make sure you are listed on all school forms as co parents, get copies of all their medical records. Know their pre school and school teachers, ensure you are listed as to be contacted by their Dr for all medical appointments. Do not give any extra money outside orderes support and keep all communication strictly about the kids. Take your time and really know their routine, keep clothes at your place and don't focus on making sure they always have a bag packed. Get duplicates of their favorite items in case it's left at the other parents house. If at all possible, do not speak ill of their other parent in front of them. Future partners need to know that your kids come first, and be very specific with any of your stbx new partners that you are not going anywhere and will be their parent. These are all things I was told when I got divorced and it's helped.", "My ex said he wanted 50/50 custody, and i was surprised as hell cause he had done nothing for the kids for 4 years..  not a single thing, and then he wanted 50/50.   His motivations were 100% because he didn't want to pay child support. He has had them 3 nights a fortnight. Uber eats food and goes to the pub and spends zero time with them.  He tells anyone who asks that he is a great dad. Sadly, the kids will do anything for their dad because they still love them\nI dont know your motivation, but i hope its pure and you make every moment with them count.", "Need more information. \nHowever I think 50/50 is definitely your right as a parent", "INFO - would you be actually using your parenting time or would you be putting them in daycare while you work?\n\n50/50 is great, but she should have right of first refusal to take the kids while you work.
