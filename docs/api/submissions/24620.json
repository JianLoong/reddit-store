How does your wife feel about it?  4 weeks should have been enough time for her brothers to come visit.  It really is about what your wife thinks and feels.  Follow her lead concerning her family.  You can proceed as you wish, but this really shouldn't be your issue but your wife's (her family).", "Info: what was the reason given why they didn't visit?", "Hospitalization sounds like time when I\u2019d like to have the absolute minimum of guests and calls. The brothers were updated by their mom at all times - so obviously they cared to know about your wife\u2019s condition. Is it possible they were trying to give her space for fast recovery? NAH, I\u2019d talk to them before assuming.", "Info - you do what you feel is right but I dont think there\u2019s enough info to judge this. We would need their perspective as to why they didnt visit/reach out.", "NAH. At least not based on the limited info you've given. People deal with grief and loss differently. Some people rally around each other; some people shut down. Give them a little grace if you can.", "NTA, you\u2019re completely right, her situation could of had degraded in the ICU and they could of had lost her. Just shows their priorities.", "NTA People are correct in that not everybody visits the hospital, but with current technology there is no excuse to not at least send an email/text of support.\n\nIt isn\u2019t your place to make big decisions about your brothers in law, but to me their behavior sent a message that allows you to make a decision you do have power over.\n\nThey got info from their mother and never talked to you. They knew their sister was incapacitated and wouldn\u2019t really be impacted by the hospital visit, so in effect they would be visiting t lo support you and chose not to.\n\nI don\u2019t think your brothers in law like YOU very much, and while you should still be civil to them for your wife\u2019s sake, I wouldn\u2019t be expending a lot of effort on my relationship with them.", "People show love in different ways.\n\nMy brothers all love me, but they wouldn\u2019t dream of visiting me in hospital.  \n\nNAH", "NTA\u2026.but after years of doing chemo with my daughter, we discovered there are some people who cannot go into hospitals\u2026my FIL\u2026my current husband\u2026.both have such horrible anxiety about hospitals that they will avoid them at all costs\u2026", "Not your business\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Some families and groups of friends  handle serious hospitalization with one person relating information. And no or few visitors to not put extra stress on the ill person. Your MIL took on role of relaying information, so you did not have that task. Work schedules, inconvenient parking, phobia of hospitals, the person's own health issues may make visiting a hospital very difficult or impossible. See how your wife feels and follow her lead", "Info - why didn't they?\n\nI spend a lot of time in the hospital, regular wards, HDU and ICU depending on what's happened at the time and I literally cannot stand my family endlessly messaging me and asking what's going on.  My husband has to field them and encourages them to let me rest. I find it so overbearing. What if your wife feels like this too?", "I would communicate with them and let them know you would have appreciated the support from them visiting.  However, some people and spouses find it very stressful to have visitors while in the hospital. Sometimes visitors can be overwhelming.  They may have thought they were doing the right thing.", "So, they have jobs and lives they can just leave and live max an hour away?\n\nI think they should have visited, but perhaps there were legitimate reasons?\n\nNTA, anyways.", "NTA \n\nWith a brain trauma having those that have known her the longest around her makes a big difference. Yes, I would not be bothering with her family after this.", "NTA.\n\nBut be careful with this one. If the family is close knit, take into consideration perhaps other reasons why they didn\u2019t contact your wife. People process and handle illness differently. Have they reached out to you at all?", "I can understand not being able to visit. But not calling or texting? Anyway I would follow wife's lead on this one.", "ESH\n\nJust because they vacation together doesn't mean these brothers are prepared to deal with such a traumatic situation.  You don't have the right to superimpose your approach on them.  Demote \"they SHOULD have\" to \"it MIGHT have been nice\".\n\nI wouldn't expect you to be chummy with them next time you see them, but you have to accept people where they're at because the only one stressed out about it is you right now. That stress can literally put you in the hospital right alongside your wife.  Go take some long walks. Meditate. Deep breaths. You can let this go.", "I may get flack for this, but having been the patient in this situation, being in the hospital for weeks on end and not having family visit? It sucked and it hurt. Did they call her or just wait for mom updates? Some people \u2018don\u2019t like\u2019 hospitals. No one likes hospitals! Especially the person being poked and prodded and in pain!! Not visiting even once is just wrong. They are arse holes and you\u2019re NTA. Keep protecting your wife. Especially with her brain trauma.", "NTA\n\nwhen people show and/or tell you who they are, believe them", "It was brain trauma, so she is still in the midst of getting memories back and doesn't fully grasp the situation.", "Is there a scenario you are aware of that would allow you not to visit a sibling in the ICU after a month?", "I still think they could have texted at the very least! When she regains more memory and starts to really recover she could/will scroll through those messages and see who thought/cared about her!", "Remember they didn't visit OR call OR text for one month.  I'd question how much love there really is if they couldn't connect with that month.", "It would be hard to continue a relationship for people not visiting for that.  Geez!  Some people.", "During the time that they didn\u2019t visit, was your wife capable of knowing if they were there or not?", "ICUs have limited visitation. If Mom is giving them the info, maybe they don't want to intrude on your or Mom's time visiting. And they are getting your wife's status from her.  \nDo they live close to you or would it be an actual trip to get to the hospital/home?  \nDo they have children they would need to set up a babysitter so they could come visit?  \nDo they have work issues that they might not be able to work around or reschedule?  \nMaybe they just didn't know what to say. Some people have a hard time with even the simplest hospital visits.\n\nThere are many factors that could go into not getting there.\n\nIt is one thing planning a vacation or who's house it is for the holiday, months to figure out logistics, etc. You cannot compare the two.", "Yes - I think it is important to understand why they did not communicate or visit before we call them AHs. \n\nExactly how close are they and how often did they communicate? Where are they located in comparison to you/the hospital? Did they have the full picture and understand the severity? Do you know what your MIL was telling them and if they were getting updates from her regularly?", "Only a great distance... I'm in another continent so it would be quite difficult, but that or a medical emergency (a brother not being physically able to travel) would be the only reason I can think of for not traveling to see family. Considering there's a good relationship (as you mentioned), of course not if you're LC or NC", "I haven\u2019t called my brother in a year.  He broke his collar bone in that time.\n\nI love him.  He loves me.\n\nMy other brother likes to be contacted a lot, so I do.  He is different to me and my other brother so I meet his needs.\n\nNot everyone expresses their love in the same way.\n\nIf you wanted support then you teach the people around you that that\u2019s what you need.  If you need hugs, then teach your loved ones that\u2019s what you need to feel loved.  If you need communication , then that\u2019s what you teach them you need.\n\nYour wife\u2019s relationship with her brothers isn\u2019t for you to decide on.  If SHE is hurt then you support her.  If she isn\u2019t - then YOU are creating drama when she doesn\u2019t need it.\n\nRight now she is fragile and recovering.  The last thing she needs is to umpire between you and her family.", "But they did connect. They were texting their Mother who was keeping them updated. Maybe they didn\u2019t want to intrude on you because you, I\u2019m sure, had more than enough on your plate so maybe they felt they weren\u2019t adding even more. \n\nOr given many ICU have strict visitation rules they wanted to give you & their Mother priority especially as Mum was keeping them updated. If only 1-2 visitors at a time are allowed. \n\nOr maybe they just hate hospitals & couldn\u2019t bear the thought of seeing their sister so dangerously ill. \n\nOr maybe they were ill & didn\u2019t want to cause further problems by infecting your wife, you or the Mother. \n\nOr maybe they had child care issues. \n\nOr maybe due to strict hospital visiting hours (don\u2019t know if that is a thing) they would have struggled to make them. \n\nOr more likely it was a combination of everything. \n\nI think right now you are in shock given everything you\u2019ve seen your poor wife go through & of course are naturally stressed & worried about her healing & her future prognosis. It sounds like this is being channeled into anger at her brothers. This isn\u2019t fair on them OR you OR your wife. \n\nI\u2019d focus your time for now on your wife & helping her. Then when the opportunity arises ask your MIL and/or her brothers & find out why. Don\u2019t jump to conclusions until you know the facts.", "Yes and no.   She recognized folks that showed up but struggled at recalling prior days visits.", "Yeah I\u2019d caution OP from assuming the worst, and acting accordingly without even finding out more.  \n\nMaybe her mom said she just needed her rest and visitors weren\u2019t needed. Maybe they didn\u2019t wanna pry or be a bother. Maybe the seriousness of this was downplayed. Maybe there\u2019s a family history that makes people shut down with medical stuff. Who knows, but it seems OP could be jumping the gun a bit", "They all live about 1 hour from the hospital.   Nobody was telling them not to visit or contact her.", "I think you need to talk to them and express how you feel about this and maybe decide from there. I think in emotional and stressful situations like this, people sometimes channel that stress into other emotions, in this case anger. \n\nShould they have visited, probably. But I dont think jumping right to NC is the right solution."]}
