I don\u2019t know if that invalidates the point of my original post, but I can assure my mother-son relationship is very important for me (as much as if I was a girl lol). So yeah, sharing a room with my uncle isn\u2019t creepy, just annoying.\n\nUPDATE: Had dinner with my mother yesterday and we straighten things out, good thing I had therapy a day before so I was bulletproof\u2019d to her manipulation.\n\nI told her, yet again, how I was feeling neglected and that she overstepped the boundaries I had made. She was really sorry, but both of them already paid and couldn\u2019t cancel without losing a considerable sum of money. I told her to enjoy her trip and good luck in the trips to come because I wouldn\u2019t tag along anymore (as long as uncle was part of it). Again, she cried a lot and suggested that we have another trip in July, just the two of us.\n\nThat\u2019s what I wanted, right? Well\u2026 as soon as I listened to the proposal, I didn\u2019t quite wanted to accept it, I\u2019m still feeling betrayed and more so, the trip that we planned and was preparing for almost 4 months wouldn\u2019t be the same, she will go with my uncle and I have to settle for another destination\u2026\n\nI didn\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d yet, I\u2019m not that stubborn and really like to travel with her. It\u2019s just I still got that bad taste in my mouth, but didn\u2019t want to act recklessly. I\u2019m very inclined in traveling with her in July, will just sit on this though for while. Unfortunately I can\u2019t wait too long, otherwise prices will skyrocket.\n\nThanks for all the feedbacks and kind words. Hope this show my relatives that they can\u2019t push me around and infiltrate my well earned vacation.", "created_utc": 1675963424, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y0dg8/update_aita_for_bailing_on_a_trip_with_my_mother/", "score": 61, "replies": ["You can ask her rather than July, maybe to reschedule for next year so you have more time to prepare for something more exciting to do with her?", "People generally don't change their behavior unless they feel the consequences of those behavior. I'd let her plan and pay for this next supposed trip and see what happens.", "Is it possible for her to pay for your part of the trip in July and you pay her back when the trip is over and no aunts or uncles made an appearance? Sort of like a deposit, and if she breaks her promise she loses her deposit. It might make her more inclined to stick to your plans and your bonding time. Although, if the bonding time were so important as to make her cry when you cancel, you'd think that alone would be motivation enough for her to put her foot down. It's easy to let someone tag along when you're not the one being inconvenienced!\n\nAlso, good for you for sticking to your guns!", "I would be careful about future plans. You said she\u2019s manipulative. \n\nShe might do it again but won\u2019t tell you until after you paid the next time. \n\nI would buy travel insurance for next time in case you need to cancel last minute.\n\nIf your mom can\u2019t say no, most likely she\u2019ll blame you with her siblings. She\u2019ll tell them it\u2019s your fault and the siblings might tell your mom just not to tell you until the trip starts or until you already paid.\n\nIn any case, NTA\n\nGood luck.", "It sounds like the deal is still that you have to share a room/cabin with your uncle.  \n\nIf that's the deal then you should absolutely decline to go.  I understand \"he invited himself\" but your mother has no excuse for not telling you about it.  She has to learn to stand up to him if she cares about you.\n\nIf he is on the cruise in his own cabin, then that is still an annoyance but more of a close call on whether you go.", "Good for you, standing up to your mother's manipulation! Would it be possible for you to plan a destination for just you and your mother and not tell a soul ahead of time? Tell her to pack a suitcase, give you money for her share, and the two of you take off.", "Your mother needs to learn to say \n\n#\"NO\"", "NTA\n\nI am glad you stuck to your decision of not going. Your mother was very capable of saying no to your Uncle. So she has now learned that when you say something, you mean it. I would be willing to book a trip with her again in July and see what happens with that trip. If she invites others to come along again, then I would not plan any further trips with her.", "I would tell her that you can plan for next year with her and say nothing else.  Then YOU travel in July and make sure to post a lot about it.", "NTA - you and your mother\u2019s special trips for mother-son bonding time are no longer that.  Your mother has forgotten that the point of the trip was for the two of you to spend time together while enjoying some cool places.  She is not making it clear to the rest of the family, that it is fun because it is a mom-son thing.  That you don\u2019t want to share it with others, because then it is not the same.  If she wants to go on vacation with the others, that\u2019s fine, but you won\u2019t be joining.  You wanted to travel with her, just the two of you.  If she doesn\u2019t want to do that, that is fine, she can go with whom she wants.\n\nIf she wants mother son trips, then when someone asks her about her trip and says they want to go, her response should be this is a mother-son trip for us to bond, you will need to plan your own trip at some other time.  If she doesn\u2019t want to say this, then she needs to stop talking about the trips so that they don\u2019t know until after you are back.  She talks about the trips, they ask to go, she won\u2019t say no\u2026 so if she really wants a mother son trip, she needs to change her behavior and stop allowing people to glom on to your trip.", "Yes this right here! You do all the planning then tell your mom the details on when and where to show up."]}
