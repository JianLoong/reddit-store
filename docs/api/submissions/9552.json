I don\u2019t know if that invalidates the point of my original post, but I can assure my mother-son relationship is very important for me (as much as if I was a girl lol). So yeah, sharing a room with my uncle isn\u2019t creepy, just annoying.\n\nUPDATE: Had dinner with my mother yesterday and we straighten things out, good thing I had therapy a day before so I was bulletproof\u2019d to her manipulation.\n\nI told her, yet again, how I was feeling neglected and that she overstepped the boundaries I had made. She was really sorry, but both of them already paid and couldn\u2019t cancel without losing a considerable sum of money. I told her to enjoy her trip and good luck in the trips to come because I wouldn\u2019t tag along anymore (as long as uncle was part of it). Again, she cried a lot and suggested that we have another trip in July, just the two of us.\n\nThat\u2019s what I wanted, right? Well\u2026 as soon as I listened to the proposal, I didn\u2019t quite wanted to accept it, I\u2019m still feeling betrayed and more so, the trip that we planned and was preparing for almost 4 months wouldn\u2019t be the same, she will go with my uncle and I have to settle for another destination\u2026\n\nI didn\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d yet, I\u2019m not that stubborn and really like to travel with her. It\u2019s just I still got that bad taste in my mouth, but didn\u2019t want to act recklessly. I\u2019m very inclined in traveling with her in July, will just sit on this though for while. Unfortunately I can\u2019t wait too long, otherwise prices will skyrocket.\n\nThanks for all the feedbacks and kind words. Hope this show my relatives that they can\u2019t push me around and infiltrate my well earned vacation.", "created_utc": 1675963424, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y0dg8/update_aita_for_bailing_on_a_trip_with_my_mother/", "score": 215, "replies": ["You can ask her rather than July, maybe to reschedule for next year so you have more time to prepare for something more exciting to do with her?", "People generally don't change their behavior unless they feel the consequences of those behavior. I'd let her plan and pay for this next supposed trip and see what happens.", "Is it possible for her to pay for your part of the trip in July and you pay her back when the trip is over and no aunts or uncles made an appearance? Sort of like a deposit, and if she breaks her promise she loses her deposit. It might make her more inclined to stick to your plans and your bonding time. Although, if the bonding time were so important as to make her cry when you cancel, you'd think that alone would be motivation enough for her to put her foot down. It's easy to let someone tag along when you're not the one being inconvenienced!\n\nAlso, good for you for sticking to your guns!", "I would be careful about future plans. You said she\u2019s manipulative. \n\nShe might do it again but won\u2019t tell you until after you paid the next time. \n\nI would buy travel insurance for next time in case you need to cancel last minute.\n\nIf your mom can\u2019t say no, most likely she\u2019ll blame you with her siblings. She\u2019ll tell them it\u2019s your fault and the siblings might tell your mom just not to tell you until the trip starts or until you already paid.\n\nIn any case, NTA\n\nGood luck.", "It sounds like the deal is still that you have to share a room/cabin with your uncle.  \n\nIf that's the deal then you should absolutely decline to go.  I understand \"he invited himself\" but your mother has no excuse for not telling you about it.  She has to learn to stand up to him if she cares about you.\n\nIf he is on the cruise in his own cabin, then that is still an annoyance but more of a close call on whether you go.", "Good for you, standing up to your mother's manipulation! Would it be possible for you to plan a destination for just you and your mother and not tell a soul ahead of time? Tell her to pack a suitcase, give you money for her share, and the two of you take off.", "Your mother needs to learn to say \n\n#\"NO\"", "NTA\n\nI am glad you stuck to your decision of not going. Your mother was very capable of saying no to your Uncle. So she has now learned that when you say something, you mean it. I would be willing to book a trip with her again in July and see what happens with that trip. If she invites others to come along again, then I would not plan any further trips with her.", "I would tell her that you can plan for next year with her and say nothing else.  Then YOU travel in July and make sure to post a lot about it.", "NTA - you and your mother\u2019s special trips for mother-son bonding time are no longer that.  Your mother has forgotten that the point of the trip was for the two of you to spend time together while enjoying some cool places.  She is not making it clear to the rest of the family, that it is fun because it is a mom-son thing.  That you don\u2019t want to share it with others, because then it is not the same.  If she wants to go on vacation with the others, that\u2019s fine, but you won\u2019t be joining.  You wanted to travel with her, just the two of you.  If she doesn\u2019t want to do that, that is fine, she can go with whom she wants.\n\nIf she wants mother son trips, then when someone asks her about her trip and says they want to go, her response should be this is a mother-son trip for us to bond, you will need to plan your own trip at some other time.  If she doesn\u2019t want to say this, then she needs to stop talking about the trips so that they don\u2019t know until after you are back.  She talks about the trips, they ask to go, she won\u2019t say no\u2026 so if she really wants a mother son trip, she needs to change her behavior and stop allowing people to glom on to your trip.", "Yes this right here! You do all the planning then tell your mom the details on when and where to show up.", "That\u2019s a good point, I could really wait for next year instead of doing something that feels rushed.\n\nI will put some thought, maybe a little more time is better.", "I see your point, but since I left her house i don\u2019t let her pay anything for me. It\u2019s when I finally felt independent.\n\nOther Redditor said to make her to something like a deposit, I would pay back if no one shows up. Seems like a good ideia, but I really want her to understand that we don\u2019t need somebody else. If I charge her because someone shows up, it seems like it\u2019s a fine to a contract.", "She asked me not to say a word to my uncle, about me bailing the trip lol.\n\nShe\u2019s afraid if I tell him, he would be pissed and cancel as well, so she would have to travel alone.\n\nWon\u2019t lie, I flirted with that ideia, but then I would be the asshole.", "That\u2019s not how travel insurance usually works\u2026\u2026 they will give you your money back if someone dies or is injured/gets sick and can\u2019t go not because you had a last minute \u2018change of mind\u2019", "Thanks, I\u2019m proud of myself to have put the foot down.\n\nIt\u2019s been a awhile since I let her pay my part of the trip, I understand that would like a \u201cdeposit\u201d and I would pay back, but it Seems like I\u2019m forcing her hand, and it was never the point of those trips.\n\nI really want to go just the two of us, because both are on the same page, enjoying a trip together. I don\u2019t want to make a \u201cor else\u2026\u201d clausule. If it hurts on her pocket yeah, she wouldn\u2019t probably call anyone else, but that\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m after.", "It could happen, but if you know manipulative people you may know how controlling they are (that\u2019s why they are always manipulating stuff, to be in control).\n\nFor something like that to happen I would have to make plans and tell her with weeks of anticipation, otherwise she would have a nervous breakdown for not being in control of where she\u2019s going. (It sounds stupid, but I can see this happening lol).", "I second that, brother.", "I already declined this hypothesis, I won\u2019t share a room with my uncle again, it\u2019s a terrible experience, let alone a ship cabin, the space is minuscule.\n\nThis next trip that we might go, it has to be me and her, or no deal.", "Thanks. Yeah, she asked for a chance to prove that our trips are also special for her, that\u2019s the chance I\u2019m giving. If she calls anyone on this one, it\u2019s done.", "It\u2019s not a bad ideia, I could make something up, call some friends.\n\nIt\u2019s something I\u2019ll put some thought on, thanks.", "If you do that, be sure to tell her that if she ever pulls a stunt like that again, you\u2019ll never travel with her again.", "It's not a bad idea to do it that way. You request a high deposit on full acceptance that this is a you and her break, not you, her, and whomever tom, dick or harry comes along. It's conditional with you never doing a trip again if it's broken. Therefore she knows that with this trip if your uncle happens to attend because she can't say no, then that's it done and dusted never again, because she can't be trusted.\n\nThe other way to do it is to ask her for trust. You look at arranging the whole break, flights, car, train whatever transport, and hotel rooms, work out her cost, and ask her for her contribution and say it's all a surprise. She can't allow anyone to come, if she doesn't know where it's happening.\n\nThe reality is, if she's a people pleaser, this is gunna just keep happening till she has some very real consequences. I mean you've effectively just ignored what's happened with this break, because she still gets you for the next one, and who knows what will happen with the next trip, because as soon as you feel the strain of costs going up, you'll commit, and can't pull out with out loosing money, then he can still turn up. You need to add consequences for her actions. If she wants to holiday with your uncle, she can, just do her own break instead. Stop enabling her.", "Yeah next time ensure it's fully refundable and make sure your mum knows you paid for that parachute in the event of \"unforeseen developments or travel companions\"", "But you actually wouldn\u2019t be. If the issue isn\u2019t addressed with your uncle (this trip is only for me and mom/me and my son, sorry), then he will invite himself again and again because he doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a problem. If he cancels and she has to travel by herself, that\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s the consequences of her own actions.\n\nI\u2019m going to assume your mom is a really good person, given that you enjoy spending time with her so much, and that she\u2019s just very much a \u201cdon\u2019t rock the boat\u201d kind of person and conflict-avoidant. I get it, I\u2019m the same way.\n\nThe thing your mom needs to realize is that by avoiding conflict with your uncle, she is CREATING conflict with you. And YOU have to realize that she knows that, and accepts it, because she knows you will be kinder/more forgiving/less likely to cause her any consequences.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like she\u2019s saying \u201cOh I love you both, I can\u2019t choose between you,\u201d but once she knew that you were cancelling because of your uncle, NOT CHOOSING BECAME A CHOICE. An intentional choice. She chose to upset you and ruin your long-standing tradition over avoiding conflict with her brother or causing him consequences.\n\nSay you make new plans for July. If uncle invites himself then, how will that be any different from this trip? It doesn\u2019t make you an asshole to speak up, and it wouldn\u2019t make you an asshole if you say something to your uncle, either. \n\n(Oh, NTA.)", "Travel insurance cover 3 parts.\n\n1.\tMedical insurance \n2.\tCancellations/interruption insurance \n3.\tLuggage insurance \n\nRegarding Cancellation/interruption insurance. You would be right if that\u2019s all you bought, but you want CFAR (Cancel For Any Reason) supplement insurance. \n\nSo yes, you can buy travel insurance with CFAR supplement as an option. That would allow you to get most of your money back.\n\nSo yes it\u2019s exactly how that works.", "I completely understand. I'd probably be pretty sad if the only reason for her to keep her promise, was the money. \n\nMay I suggest you get travel insurrance, so you have the option to back out? Also, maybe postpone the trip to next year? If you have to book soon, then you'll have less time to research and plan and you'll end up with an inferior trip. You should use your money and vacation time on an experience that makes you happy, not a trip that reminds you of what you missed out on.", "Could you pass it off as a Mother's Day gift? Perhaps you can give her a choice of three destinations on Mother's Day. Since it's from her son, it's only for the two of you and that it's a secret between the two of you. In any case, here's wishing the best of vacations in your future!", "Yes, make it a YOU trip and have fun :).  Take me with you, haha! Jk.  Enjoy it!"]}
