So she has struggled. \nMy husband and I try to help her as much as we can- we aren\u2019t rich by any means but we both work so obviously having 2 incomes versus her one make us in a more privileged situation. \nMy husband is lucky enough that his employer gives him a new Iphone every year. He is able to buy his old phone at a reduced price- usually around 35% of what they go for in the second hand market. He got this year\u2019s phone a month ago. We have always given my friend his old phone which, as she has 3 teenage boys helps as she gives it to one of them. We never asked her for the money my husband paid for the phone, nor did we mention to her that we did have to pay anything for it, as far as she knew it was free to my husband. \nSo we give her the phone-( it was an IPhone 13 in case anyone cares). Unfortunately at some point the charging cable had gotten lost pr broken. As a quick aside my husband and I have 4 teenagers ourselves and they all have phones. For some reason most of the chargers in our house are broken so we now only have 2 chargers and 6 phones. \nMy friend asked where the charger was and I explained it was gone and we didn\u2019t currently have a spare. She got a bit annoyed asking if I just couldn\u2019t give her one of the 2 we have but I explained that we were constantly using them as we all needed to charge our phones. She asked again for one of the chargers and I said no, a bit more firmly. \nMy husband and I both work until 5 (get home about 6), something my friend is aware of. She came by the next day around 4 when only my younger 2 teens were home (F15 and F14). She told my daughters that I had said it was ok to take one of the two chargers we had and that they should get it for her- which they did as they had no reason to question her. \nI am now quite annoyed with my friend, mostly because I feel she came over when she knew I was out and took advantage of my daughters.

She cannot be that poor so as not to one afford a charger and its cable.\n\n1. you can give her a call and demand the charger back\n2. NC her\n\nalso, its not something small. this is a major red flag if you haven't noticed.", "NTA. You told her no. Her situation must be really hard, but that's not an excuse to take advantage of you. You give her one finger and she takes the whole hand....", "NTA.  She lied over a $10 to $20 cable.  It shows that she feels entitled to your money rather than being appreciative. I would tell her the price that you paid for the phone to let her know you are spending money on her, not just giving her something useless to you.\nI would cut off financial assistance. \nAre you in the USA?  If so, she should have been receiving Social Security for each child, which isn't chump change.", "an obvious NTA situation. Your friend felt entitled to your stuff, was ignoring of the sacrifices you made for her, and lied to get your stuff behind your back. You should demand not only your charger back, but also a huge apology and a promise from her to be a better friend. Right now it doesn't seem like she deserves your help or your trust.", "Wow, you need do tell your friend that you have indeed been paying for her phones since you are nice, and that she is a thief for coming and taking one of your two chargers.  She needs to immediately return it and buy her own.  Then stop giving her phones.  You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis sort of entitled behaviour is very unattractive. \n\nI would go and demand the charger back. And tell her you actually pay for these things you are giving her. With this level of entitlement I would be reconsidering what I give her in the future. This behaviour is not something small. It's tantamount to stealing from you. She lied to your kids to get something.", "I can't imagine getting a current (and expensive) phone for free and then whinging that I didn't get the charging cable...let alone manipulating kids into giving me their cable. Come on. She's being both ungrateful and over-stepping. A charging cable doesn't cost much and if she can't afford it, then she can continue using the old phone until she can fork out for one. It won't kill her.", "NTA- I cannot believe the AUDACITY of your \u201cfriend\u201d doing this after receiving so much from you and your husband.  She is not a good person and you are no longer under any moral obligation to help her (not that you were ever). Please update us and let us know what you did.", "I would demand the charger and the phone back. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA, and from now on, no phones given to her.\nShe's learned to expect it and unfortunately not very humble about everything she's received from you.", "NTA \n\nGoing to your house behind your back and manipulating your daughters into giving her the charger is honestly nasty. Her situation must be extremely challenging but it doesn't give her a pass to disrespect you.", "NTA. This is not \"something small\". Friend appeared to deliberately manipulate your kids. Not cool. I'd give her a wide berth for a while.", "NTA, and this definitely isn't something small. She went over to your house when your two youngest were there and lied to them to steal something from your family, even if it's just a charger.\n\nI'd definitely rethink this friendship because that is just borderline insane to me that someone would do that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Warn your children to get in contact with you or your husband always, no matter who says what\n\n\n\n2.

Reduce the help - you and husband are not her parents and don't owe her diddly squat and tell her that this is happy due to her being extremely entitled. No more phones Free or paid .\n\n3. Stop for a minute and look back at this so called friendship and think what exactly does she do for you/your husband aside from mooching and treating you /your money as her property?", "NTA\n\nThis is friendship ending. It's not the charger, it's the entitlement, manipulation of your kids, and lying for something she should have ordered a replacement part for like a goddammed adult. Let her keep the charger, and stop returning her calls. Make sure your kids know she is not to be trusted anymore.", "Did she buy the phone or she got it for free?", "What the fuck, great friend that is.\nBy all means, NTA, your friend sounds horrible", "NTA - she lied. Over a charger cable. She manipulated your daughters into giving her one of the two cables you have. She could have very well gotten off her entitled ass and gone out and bought a charger cable. You've done more than enough for this woman over the years. It's time to let her sink or swim on her own.", "NTA. She's taken your generosity for granted. Tell her the free iphones are no longer available.  At this point i don't know if the friendship is even worth trying to salvage.", "NTA. I would certainly not be helping this person anymore. That was beyond the pale.", "NTA. She's totally taking advantage of you at this point, takes your kindness and help for granted and feels entitled to it. This time it was only a phone charger. What is it gonna be next? These chargers don't even cost a lot, she's being absolutely cheap and rude. But what will she demand next time around? Cut your losses. Her husband dying 10 years ago because he drove drunk is not a freepass for her to act like that. She had 10 years to pull herself back up, and her kids should be more than capable to be self-sufficient enough to not need full-time supervision. Yes, she probably won't be able to live the high life. Most can't. So what? It was her choice to marry, have kids and stay with a drunkard without any backup plan. And at some point, there is only that much sympathy you can give someone. I know this all sounds harsh. But if you don't raise hard boundaries know, she'll just keep going.", "Ntah, but\u2026\n1. You should all get more chargers. You get two pac for like $10 on a****n. Yes you can afford them since you give away iPhones that you can sell. \n2.  Your \u201cfried \u201c is an ah obviously. Cut her off since she stole from you. Says a lot about her character and how grateful she actually is. She bit the hand that feeds her, and should not get any more.", "NTA this person tried to browbeat you into giving her your property, and when that failed, she came to your house, lied to your children, and stole the item. This person isn't your friend. She doesn't see you as a friend. She sees you as someone who should be subsidising her. She's entitled and you would be well rid.", "NTA.  Wow\u2026 Just wow.   Even if she doesn\u2019t have the true knowledge that you guys actually pay for these phones every year, she should in all honesty suspect that\u2019s the case. But even if she thinks it\u2019s just free, you could also give it to your own kids, or you can sell it. She knows year after year she gets an amazing expensive \u2018giveaway\u2019.  When you informed her there is no longer a charger for it she got \u2018annoyed\u2019 and asked you for one of your two and too few ones?  Right there would\u2019ve told me an awful lot about who this person is. Then to find out she goes to your house when she knows you\u2019re not there lies to your children to steal one?   \n\n Nope this isn\u2019t a friend.  Sob story or not, that\u2019s not cool at all.", "NTA", "NTA. I think you are feeling guilty bc the cost of a charger cable is \u201csmall\u201d, she didn\u2019t steal a big ticket item from you so you think maybe your level of anger is misappropriate for the offense. The thing is what she did is not something small, I would be less angry over someone stealing my car then manipulate my kid.  \n\nThe monetary value of what she took matters far less then the way she went about getting it. I am sure you daughter, even if not expressing it, feels awful she let this happen, maybe even stupid, I would have as a kid. Worse yet if this lady has been any part of her life in a meaningful way it taught her she can\u2019t trust the adults in her life. \n\nIt is gross, gross behavior. A personal tragedy in someone\u2019s life doesn\u2019t give them license to be a shit individual to others.", "She overstepped your boundaries.\n\nCall her and let her know that the free phone train has stopped and her boys will have to deal with not having 'updated' phones each year.\n\nThe charger is the least expensive thing about the phone so she should have been able to get one or save for it.", "NTA \nThat was theft.

She definitely took advantage of the knowledge that OP wouldn't be home by then in order to manipulate OP's kids, who trusted her because their mother (OP), told them that the friend was trustworthy, in order to have something as stupid as a phone charger.
