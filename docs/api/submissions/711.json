You are the asshole though for staying with this man and allowing him to treat you this way. Allowing this nonsense to continue is just enabling him at this point. He's nearly 50?! He's not going to change at this point. And it would be one thing if he legitimately just needed a bit of help because he's struggling during a rough time, but he has the money for gambling, onlyfans and grunt gear? How convenient that he always finds the money for the fun stuff.\n\nThere are so many red flags here I don't even know where to start. Why are you even with this guy?!\n\nI'm just curious, how old are you?", "NTA\n\nHe's a user and a mooch, and sounds like he may have a gambling addiction. Why are you with someone like this?", "NTA. But also, that's a huge red flag. Could he be possibly waiting for a big win in gambling to fund the check?", "NTA - dump him. Now.", "YTA. You\u2019re being unreasonable for staying with someone who you have to \u201cforce\u201d to pay bills. \n\nDate someone who acts their age.", "NTA.  At least he has you there to \"help\" him pay his bills.  As an adult, a person should pay bills first then play later.\n\nI hope you're not living together, but I suspect you are.  This may not be a good relationship for you.  \n\nIf you want to \"help him\" then think seriously about this.  Go to a Gambling Anonymous meeting and just listen.  It is okay to say, if asked, \"I'm just here to listen.\"  Might open your eyes a bit.", "Military surplus stuff. Holsters, fatigues, helmets, armor, etc.", "Thank you.  He\u2019s TA.", "he\u2019s FORTY-SIX??? he\u2019s a grown man acting like THIS? run babe NTA", "NTA. Why are so many people putting up with bad partners?", "NTA - He is ridiculous \n\nYTA- For staying with someone who is obviously disrespecting you, lying to you and using your kindness. Dump the loser.", "NTA, and relationships quickly sour when one person has to parent the other", "NTA - bills don't wait around and not paying on time can affect both your credit ratings. You need a serious talk, and if he can't afford to live with you it's time for him to find his own place and get in the real world. Sounds like he's taking advantage and you're funding his lifestyle. Red flag if he doesn't adapt and pay up on time after a real world talk. Good luck.", "Ma'am, why are you supporting a grown ass man behaving this way? NTA for demanding he pay his bills, but YTA for continuing to stay with a 46 year old boyfriend that treats you like this.", "NTA but there's millions of other people who are responsible adults paying their bills on time and budgeting their $ properly.  I'd dump this guy and go find one of them.  Yes, you might love them, but it takes more than just love to have a healthy relationship.", "NTA\n\nAdults should carry their own weight in household expenses, and only spend money on vices and luxuries once those are paid.\n\nBy age 46, most adults have reached that level of maturity and sufficiency.    \n\nIn other subreddits, you would surely be getting advice about terminating the relationship, or taking more steps to address the behavior you find unappealing.", "NTA... He is the jerk for putting you in the position to have to ask him to maintain his financial responsibility.", "YTA for staying, it will only get worse. Leave", "NTA. He sounds like a loser.", "NTA you made it too good for him for far too long. He got used to your generosity. Reality checks are tough", "NTA and please GTFO. This guy is a selfish leech.", "Yes you are being unreasonable for continuing a relationship with this person.", "NTA, but the bigger question is - why are you with this guy?  Look into your future with his behavior remaining the same.  Is that what you want?", "Are his bills higher than when he didn\u2019t live with u?", "You\u2019re the asshole for not dumping him", "Info: are you dating one of my exs cause that sounds familiar.", "D E A D B E A T\n\nNTA", "Say goodbye.

Too lazy to start over? Better to be in a shifty relationship than alone? She's 48, she probably thinks this is the best she'll get, and it doesn't seem like she wants to do better.", "I'm 48. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I appreciate your feedback.", "Thanks. We've been together for 8 years and he just started helping with bills 6 months ago.", "Thank you. I'm definitely in a slump. I need to get out of it.", "I want someone I can depend on. That's not him though. I do feel trapped. I've just got to change.", "We've been living together for 8 years and he started helping with bills 6 months ago. I guess he doesn't like it. And no, his bills aren't higher with me. They are practically non-existent.", "That is so sad and so unnecessary.", "At this point there shouldn't even be an ice cube, let alone an ice berg. He's 46, you're 48, I'm 49, I'm sure you and I both know that's plenty of time to get one's shit together. Paying bills on time is such a minimum expectation. He can't even do that? Dump him!\n\nEdit: WTF are you even doing with a man who spends his bill money on online gambling and cam girls? Sis. Come on. You know better than this.", "...This is just the tip of the iceberg?\n\nGirl, RUN!!!!", "Have you lived together that long?", "You deserve a partner who will happily pull their share of the load.", "The first step is the hardest.  Present him with a fait accompli - pack his stuff while he\u2019s out, change the locks, when he comes in say, \u201cplease take your things and leave, this isn\u2019t working out for me.  Good luck in your future\u201d.  Do not let him talk you out of it.", "Breaking from a relationship, especially long-term, is always so hard. Even if you\u2019re 100% sure you need it. Not at all the same cuz your situation is more messed up and he\u2019s disrespecting you, but I dated a man 5 years and realized I was a lesbian and it was STILL hard to break up. Ending things you\u2019ve gotten used to and having to adjust to the new reality is scary. But it is so so worth it", "Wtf, why did it take 7.5yrs? When someone is use to a cushy arrangement, it\u2019s natural to get pissed when it changes. It\u2019s like an actor complaining that theyre only getting 5million for a film when they\u2019re use to 10", "Yes", "Wow. I'm sorry you had to prop him.up for so long.

He's just bad with money.", "Are you truly happy with him and is it what you want for the rest of your life? Sorry to say it as an outsider who doesn't know or understand your situation or relationship (so i could be way off here), but from his temper and the entitlement you've described it sounds like you may be in an abusive relationship. Look up the thread narcissisticabuse - see if anything resonates and maybe ask for some advice on there. I wish you all the best and hope that he steps up and I'm completely wrong about him.", "Girl this is bad, you deserve better. He is pathetic and honestly just completely disrespectful of you. What would he do if you broke up or he kicked you out? He needs to man up and act his age like my god 19 year olds can do better than him at being an adult.", "You're not way off. You're about right on. I don't like to admit it. I appreciate the feedback.", "I know you are right. But that makes it look even more pathetic. I don't even feel like I'm actually talking about my life. And I do break up, but he doesn't leave. It's a mess.", "If you don't see a long term future, think about an exit plan, there is a lot of support available out there. Good luck and I hope you find someone who treats you right and values you, you sound like a loving and caring person.\n\nEdit: typo", "Honestly, if everything is in your name I\u2019d get an actual eviction notice. If you break up and he doesn\u2019t want to pay anything, you would have no issue getting him removed and honestly I think you could really feel happier about your life once it\u2019s done and you have some distance to be the You that exists unattached to him", "Thank you. I know you are right."]}
