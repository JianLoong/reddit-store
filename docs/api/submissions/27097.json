It's admirable that you're trying to stick up for her and you may have been one of the first people who have cared enough about her to say something about the situation.  However blurting it out wasn't the best best method of expression of your feelings.  You have 4 months invested with her, and she has several years, so you will need to determine if it's a worth further investment if she's not willing to compromise on her choice of friends.", "NTA. \n\nOP, if you heard it, 9/10 that\u2019s what it was. A bunch of mean people dumping on the one that will \u201ctake it\u201d because it allows her to sit at the \u201ccool kids table\u201d. You\u2019re not the AH for sticking up her her because that\u2019s what you do when you care about someone. \n\nHowever, if you continue to be with someone that\u2019s unwilling to not only stand up for themselves, but want anyone that calls their \u201cfriends\u201d out or not do it, you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure and disappointment. It\u2019s better to walk away now as opposed to having to see and deal with it. You\u2019re too much of a person of integrity to have to deal with it. If she wants to, fine. You have the choice to save yourself before you get in too deep. Because, and I speak from experience, if they\u2019re talking about her to her face in front of you, they\u2019re gonna talk about you also to her and she won\u2019t defend you.

She thought it was normal & \u201cjust how they are\u201d. It\u2019s cognitive dissonance. You told her something that was counter to her reality. When she was quiet then asked you to leave, you likely made something snap in her. Deep down she knows your right, but now she\u2019s stuck between ditching all her friends or just continuing to take it. And as a bf of 4 months, it\u2019s really hard to choose you over friends she\u2019s had for years.", "NTA\n\nIf you didn't misinterpret what happened, your girlfriend must probably be in denial and must be used to being treated that way. Don't be pushy with her because it gets you nowhere, just tell her things and let her do what she wants with the information. You can't force her to understand and if you insist too much, it can end up driving you apart.", "You might be right but I'm not sure you can make a definitive judgement call based on one meeting, especially because she is naturally going to be the center of attention when she is introducing the new boyfriend.", "NTA.     Truth hurts, and you may have opened her eyes to the bullies.   Give her some time.    She needs to come to grips with it.   Then again, she may have pulled an ostrich.", "NTA she may be in denial because she wants to have friends and it\u2019s hard to find friends.

We\u2019re taught about this tactic so we keep an eye out for it. You meet her friends and almost immediately start bashing them. It\u2019s kind of a red flag. Again, I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s why you did it, but I want to point out, that\u2019s something I think a lot of women would think.\n\nAlso, perception really colors an experience. How you perceived things to be and how her or her friends did could be very different. She\u2019s known you 4 months, she\u2019s known them at least 10. Maybe they are dicks, maybe they were dicks to get a rise out of you, maybe they\u2019re just rude people but don\u2019t actually mean anything by it. Maybe you gave her something to think about and if you did, you\u2019ve now made her question her friends of 10 years and if she goes back to think over the last 10 years and they have in fact just been assholes to her, that\u2019s a lot to reckon with.", "You may not be the asshole, but I don't think you have a girlfriend anymore.", "OP it seems you may have made her realize her \"friends\" are not really friends and she may be finally having to confront it.

Athough you may feel someone can do better, they obviously do not feel so, and you have to accept their self-limiting beliefs, as that is their choice.

From what you describe, you absolutely hurt her feelings, and pushing her to see something she doens't want or isn't ready to see yet, isn't actually going to make her see.  \nOn balance, probably there was a better (slowly slowly) way to go about it, so on your direct question, I would have to say YTA.

Your job is to support her, not lecture her or tell her who she should or shouldn't hangout with.", "That's an incel reply", "To help her see the relationship from an outside perspective, which people need sometimes,  especially if it's a relationship they've had so long they've grown used to it. My wife and I helped her cousin see a long-time friendship was one-sided and emotionally abusive,  she had been it so long she'd become used to it even though she hated how she was treated.", "Even better, but upon first meeting/introduction it\u2019s a bit different because first impressions are a thing. You risk her bad friends trying to put thoughts in her head against you.", "I don't really agree with forcing yourself into a friend dynamic on a first meeting tbh. Not your place to tell her her friends are shit after a couple months of dating.", "OP has said they were only needling HER. It was not an all around, mutual thing.", "This, and OP's just met them for the first time, he doesn't know anything about them. Like \"her degree choice is basic\"? My friends would straight up be calling me basic lol. \n\nLike OP could be right but I don't understand what he thought would happen, that she would just dump her friends since middle school for someone she's known for 4 months because he said so?", "The thing about service friends too is that once the service friend starts to succeed, boy is the salt strong", "It may have been with the best of intentions of course, purely concerned with the things discussed here, but how is she supposed to know that?", "It doesn't matter to me what his intentions are. He, as a bf of 4 months, has NO right to be judging her friends after 1 meeting and telling her that he doesn't like them and she deserves better.", "It's even more common that a friend gets a little extra crap when they're introducing a bf or gf to the group too tbh.", "There\u2019s absolutely no way you can say with certainty that OP\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s friends are \u201cemotional/verbally abusive\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to judge without seeing them interact but if OP thinks that \u201cyour degree was basic\u201d is really such a terrible thing to say as a form of banter between friends then I lean towards him being overly sensitive as the best explanation", "> Hey I just met you, but your friends are crazy\n\n> Trust me, i'm not trying to isolate you maybe\n\n> it's hard to listen to what you say baby\n\n> just listen to me and trust me, maybe", "Good.  That's  a great way to test, early in the relationship, if your new paramour is capable of thinking for themselves, or is always going to be swayed by friends, parents, public fad, whatever.", "Yes and when then you\u2019re introducing a partner to your friends for the first time your friends are much more likely to tease you as a way of relating to your partner\n\nOP has met his girlfriend\u2019s friends once. Its too early to judge. If he notices this is a consistent behavioural trend then he might be onto something, but making leap judgements like that is ridiculous\n\nIts more likely that OP is being oversensitive based on what he thought was an unacceptable thing to tease someone about\n\nLike I said before though, it\u2019s impossible to make a judgement without seeing them interact", "I can attest to this sentiment.\n\nLuckily I grew out of this way of thinking, and instead I started treating him better, and I'm happy for my friend getting his driver's license/house and other milestones in his life\n\nHonestly typing this out I just realize I never really apologized for treating him poorly so Imma do that after work today", "Dude completely judging them after 1 meeting too.", "Sure, but it sorta sounds like you're doing the same fucking thing by telling her her friends are shit. Just saying, but if any of my friends got into a relationship where there new SO told them they think all their friends are assholes, well that's a bright red fucking flag right there. Cuts both ways. We weren't there, and some people interpret things differently. Maybe the bf is in the wrong. Idk cause we didn't actually hear any of the conversation. Just a couple vague statements from bf.", "Yeah, that's the flip side of the coin; the friends are actively testing OP, too.\n\nThe issue here is that OP is coming in hard, 4 months into a relationship and already telling his GF that she needs to stop talking to her friends."]}
