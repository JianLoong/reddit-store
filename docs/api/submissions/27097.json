It's admirable that you're trying to stick up for her and you may have been one of the first people who have cared enough about her to say something about the situation.  However blurting it out wasn't the best best method of expression of your feelings.  You have 4 months invested with her, and she has several years, so you will need to determine if it's a worth further investment if she's not willing to compromise on her choice of friends.", "NTA. \n\nOP, if you heard it, 9/10 that\u2019s what it was. A bunch of mean people dumping on the one that will \u201ctake it\u201d because it allows her to sit at the \u201ccool kids table\u201d. You\u2019re not the AH for sticking up her her because that\u2019s what you do when you care about someone. \n\nHowever, if you continue to be with someone that\u2019s unwilling to not only stand up for themselves, but want anyone that calls their \u201cfriends\u201d out or not do it, you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure and disappointment. It\u2019s better to walk away now as opposed to having to see and deal with it. You\u2019re too much of a person of integrity to have to deal with it. If she wants to, fine. You have the choice to save yourself before you get in too deep. Because, and I speak from experience, if they\u2019re talking about her to her face in front of you, they\u2019re gonna talk about you also to her and she won\u2019t defend you. And you don\u2019t deserve that.", "NTA. She needed to hear it. TBH she probably has never thought of that way because it\u2019s been their dynamic since middle school. She thought it was normal & \u201cjust how they are\u201d. It\u2019s cognitive dissonance. You told her something that was counter to her reality. When she was quiet then asked you to leave, you likely made something snap in her. Deep down she knows your right, but now she\u2019s stuck between ditching all her friends or just continuing to take it. And as a bf of 4 months, it\u2019s really hard to choose you over friends she\u2019s had for years.", "NTA\n\nIf you didn't misinterpret what happened, your girlfriend must probably be in denial and must be used to being treated that way. Don't be pushy with her because it gets you nowhere, just tell her things and let her do what she wants with the information. You can't force her to understand and if you insist too much, it can end up driving you apart.", "You might be right but I'm not sure you can make a definitive judgement call based on one meeting, especially because she is naturally going to be the center of attention when she is introducing the new boyfriend.", "NTA.     Truth hurts, and you may have opened her eyes to the bullies.   Give her some time.    She needs to come to grips with it.   Then again, she may have pulled an ostrich.", "NTA she may be in denial because she wants to have friends and it\u2019s hard to find friends. My husband has saved me from bad friendships before and though I didn\u2019t see them for what they were at the time I eventually realized he was right.", "I don\u2019t know. Some people have weird friendships where they talk shit about each other but when shit hits the fan they\u2019re there no questions.", "I don\u2019t know if I have enough information to really say but I will say this, while also pointing out I\u2019m not saying this is you:  one of the first things abusive partners do is try and isolate women from their friends and family. We\u2019re taught about this tactic so we keep an eye out for it. You meet her friends and almost immediately start bashing them. It\u2019s kind of a red flag. Again, I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s why you did it, but I want to point out, that\u2019s something I think a lot of women would think.\n\nAlso, perception really colors an experience. How you perceived things to be and how her or her friends did could be very different. She\u2019s known you 4 months, she\u2019s known them at least 10. Maybe they are dicks, maybe they were dicks to get a rise out of you, maybe they\u2019re just rude people but don\u2019t actually mean anything by it. Maybe you gave her something to think about and if you did, you\u2019ve now made her question her friends of 10 years and if she goes back to think over the last 10 years and they have in fact just been assholes to her, that\u2019s a lot to reckon with.", "You may not be the asshole, but I don't think you have a girlfriend anymore.", "OP it seems you may have made her realize her \"friends\" are not really friends and she may be finally having to confront it. I don't have any suggestions on what you should do next.", "NTA, but sticking up for her would have been the better way to go. After every negative comment, counter with \u201cwhat do you mean? She\u2019s the most beautiful woman in the world!\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean? She\u2019s obviously the best girlfriend imaginable!\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean? Her choice of degree was very smart!\u201d etc., etc. All this in a sweet voice, with hugs and kisses for your girlfriend.", "Nta, and also, her reaction is not surprising.", "my friends are the same way. only difference is, we all get made fun of in the group. and even then, we all know damn well what our boundaries are and what to not make fun of about someone. \n\nmy friends bf (around the time they first started dating, he's a chill dude) poked at my lisp/stutter once, but said friend shut it down quickly. he hasn't since. \n\nNTA, but it does sound like your GF is in denial. she might not want to loose what feels like her only friends, even more so since they have history together.", "NTA\n\nBut I\u2019ve met people in groups like this before. She can\u2019t even comprehend leaving that friend group, it sounds like they\u2019re in one of those long time groups that doesn\u2019t know when it\u2019s run it\u2019s course. Your poor gf deep down knows she\u2019s the scapegoat but might not be in a place to accept it. I feel bad for her.", "NTA.", "NTA her and her friends don\u2019t have boundaries and when you try to set them she disregards them and that shows she doesn\u2019t care", "You\u2019re a good guy. Let her think for a little bit. She\u2019ll call you.", "NTA. She\u2019s conditioned to their behavior. Which is rude and demeaning. I think you did the right thing. Maybe she will think about it.", "YTA for thinking that after one meeting with you and after 4 months this was your white knight moment.\n\nYou should also correct you text to ex-girlfriend.\n\nOnce she said to drop it, you should have dropped it.\n\nIn a vacuum these sound like awful statements.\n\nIn the context of meeting a new boyfriend for the first time it could just be yanking each others chains.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nThe reality of life is a lot of people have no imagination, creativity, nor self-belief, so they'll end up choosing things beneath them: jobs, partners, friends. Athough you may feel someone can do better, they obviously do not feel so, and you have to accept their self-limiting beliefs, as that is their choice. Your girlfriend-if she is still that- chose those friends, and she told you to stop bashing them, and you would not. Get in the habit of respecting boundaries, and life will be so much easier for you.", "After one interaction with her and her friends you make that judgement call? YTA, dude.  It\u2019s startlingly naive to think you can discern something so complex in a single evening.", "Nta, her \"friends\" are", "NTA, and this is a hill you want to die on. Odd girl out behavior is real, toxic, and hard to stomach when you see it happening to someone you care about.", "If she asked you to hang out with them more and you decline thats cool, but you are the asshole here its her longtime friends and not really your place", "Kind of borderline from me, mainly because you \"kept insisting\".  From what you describe, you absolutely hurt her feelings, and pushing her to see something she doens't want or isn't ready to see yet, isn't actually going to make her see.  \nOn balance, probably there was a better (slowly slowly) way to go about it, so on your direct question, I would have to say YTA. But with the best intentions.", "YTA - while you might not be wrong, you didn't just drop it when she asked. They do sound like they're not great friends, but if you're in college then she's old enough to make her own life choices.", "YTA. These people are her life long friends, dating her for 4months doesn\u2019t qualify you to choose her friendships for her. Maybe her friends really are the worst, but that\u2019s her decision to make. You just hurt her feelings to prove what exactly?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did you honestly expect her to immediately agree with you and ditch people she considers friends? I actually find it weird that you keep pushing the issue because your behavior could be sent as trying to isolate her.

These things take time though and you need to decide whether you want to be there with her or walk away. \n\nBtw thank you for calling out their behavior.

In that context good friends, or even shitty friends should be talking you up, asking the boyfriend questions, talking about how much they love their friend, etc.\n\nThis is the one time when even most shitty friends will be nicer.
