It's admirable that you're trying to stick up for her and you may have been one of the first people who have cared enough about her to say something about the situation.  However blurting it out wasn't the best best method of expression of your feelings.  You have 4 months invested with her, and she has several years, so you will need to determine if it's a worth further investment if she's not willing to compromise on her choice of friends.", "NTA. \n\nOP, if you heard it, 9/10 that\u2019s what it was. A bunch of mean people dumping on the one that will \u201ctake it\u201d because it allows her to sit at the \u201ccool kids table\u201d. You\u2019re not the AH for sticking up her her because that\u2019s what you do when you care about someone. \n\nHowever, if you continue to be with someone that\u2019s unwilling to not only stand up for themselves, but want anyone that calls their \u201cfriends\u201d out or not do it, you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure and disappointment. It\u2019s better to walk away now as opposed to having to see and deal with it. You\u2019re too much of a person of integrity to have to deal with it. If she wants to, fine. You have the choice to save yourself before you get in too deep. Because, and I speak from experience, if they\u2019re talking about her to her face in front of you, they\u2019re gonna talk about you also to her and she won\u2019t defend you. And you don\u2019t deserve that.", "NTA. She needed to hear it. TBH she probably has never thought of that way because it\u2019s been their dynamic since middle school. She thought it was normal & \u201cjust how they are\u201d. It\u2019s cognitive dissonance. You told her something that was counter to her reality. When she was quiet then asked you to leave, you likely made something snap in her. Deep down she knows your right, but now she\u2019s stuck between ditching all her friends or just continuing to take it. And as a bf of 4 months, it\u2019s really hard to choose you over friends she\u2019s had for years.", "NTA\n\nIf you didn't misinterpret what happened, your girlfriend must probably be in denial and must be used to being treated that way. Don't be pushy with her because it gets you nowhere, just tell her things and let her do what she wants with the information. You can't force her to understand and if you insist too much, it can end up driving you apart.", "You might be right but I'm not sure you can make a definitive judgement call based on one meeting, especially because she is naturally going to be the center of attention when she is introducing the new boyfriend.", "NTA.     Truth hurts, and you may have opened her eyes to the bullies.   Give her some time.    She needs to come to grips with it.   Then again, she may have pulled an ostrich.", "NTA she may be in denial because she wants to have friends and it\u2019s hard to find friends. My husband has saved me from bad friendships before and though I didn\u2019t see them for what they were at the time I eventually realized he was right.", "I don\u2019t know.

We\u2019re taught about this tactic so we keep an eye out for it. You meet her friends and almost immediately start bashing them. It\u2019s kind of a red flag. Again, I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s why you did it, but I want to point out, that\u2019s something I think a lot of women would think.\n\nAlso, perception really colors an experience. How you perceived things to be and how her or her friends did could be very different. She\u2019s known you 4 months, she\u2019s known them at least 10. Maybe they are dicks, maybe they were dicks to get a rise out of you, maybe they\u2019re just rude people but don\u2019t actually mean anything by it. Maybe you gave her something to think about and if you did, you\u2019ve now made her question her friends of 10 years and if she goes back to think over the last 10 years and they have in fact just been assholes to her, that\u2019s a lot to reckon with.", "You may not be the asshole, but I don't think you have a girlfriend anymore.", "OP it seems you may have made her realize her \"friends\" are not really friends and she may be finally having to confront it.

Athough you may feel someone can do better, they obviously do not feel so, and you have to accept their self-limiting beliefs, as that is their choice. Your girlfriend-if she is still that- chose those friends, and she told you to stop bashing them, and you would not. Get in the habit of respecting boundaries, and life will be so much easier for you.", "After one interaction with her and her friends you make that judgement call? YTA, dude.

From what you describe, you absolutely hurt her feelings, and pushing her to see something she doens't want or isn't ready to see yet, isn't actually going to make her see.  \nOn balance, probably there was a better (slowly slowly) way to go about it, so on your direct question, I would have to say YTA.

We had many calm discussions where we each broached some problematic things we noticed, but were cautious of tone and how adamantly we insisted on the other person believing it, simply presenting our case and letting them make their own decision. \nMy recommendation... apologize for how you discussed it, that you didn't accept her side, that you're sorry you were overbearing or forceful cause ultimately, she has to choose ppl for herself and you'll support her choices even if you disagree with them. She must also trust in her own decision-making abilities! Healthy relationships allow for differences in opinion and disagreements, as long as respect remains.

To me he's NTA. I hope OP will just reiterate that he was just concerned and that this group dynamic didn't seem healthy to him, based on his own experience.\n\nAnd it makes equal sense for his gf to be annoyed with OP, a relatively recent bf, for immediately judging her friends that she's known for so long and is so used to them and this group dynamic (whether it's really toxic or not).

Not that it comes off like this is step one of isolating from the friends only. There are smart abusers and stupid abusers too. Stupid abusers do act impulsively. Now I'm NOT saying OP is am abuser. I believe that he was just incensed by how they were treating her. But he went about this so clumsily that it was counterproductive. It definitely would've *seemed* to the gf like he was one of those walking red flags that so many articles are written about. I too hope what OP said sparked something in her.
