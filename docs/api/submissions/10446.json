This has not been an easy life for you, well done that you haven't given up and thankfully your daughter is stable.

These are the types of things you have to talk through completely in the absence of that you are having a one-sided conversation with yourself which isn't fair to either one of you.

His mother is interstate (so is my family) but he feels obligated to take her so they get quality time while they can. \n\n3. The 3/4 to me was relevant, as she was healthy back then and by distance, much closer than my parents. A 3 hour drive away, versus the 13 hour all night drive my parents did.

Who helped him nearly destroy the first moments he had with his daughter???! The man needs to be NC with either his drug dealing mom (btw recovering addicts are more likely to die fron OD as their bodies can\u2019t always cope with the drug use anymore) or his family who actually cared enough to get him clean *again*. \n\nThe reason Reddit jumps to separation is because you don\u2019t typically ask a bunch of strangers for help figuring out if there\u2019s an interpersonal problem until that problem is either about to blow up in your face or already has.\n\nThe comment you responded to was a response to OP which gave ***all the context you need*** to know this is not a safe environment for OP or her child.
