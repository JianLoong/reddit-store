I think it sets an unwelcoming tone, & I would be very uncomfortable with that. Lots of people have good reasons to keep their phones close by that have nothing to do with taking photos. When my niece got married it was simply written on the invitation that they requested people stay in the moment and not take photos during the ceremony. No one had to actually take our phones.

When you told her that her phone will not be allowed she gave you a complete answer when she told you No that she is keeping her phone with her.

Do not send her an invitation and let all the other family members know that she will not be attending your wedding because she can't control her \"making content\". When she finds out she is not invited you already know she's going to have a fit, but tell her your answer is No! since she is insisting on crossing your boundary. Let her hem and haw all she wants to you and her flying monkeys. If any of her flying monkeys try to make you and your fiance the bad person (people), tell them that she is not going to ruin your wedding and if they feel that strongly about her being there, uninvite them as well. When she tries to come into the venue have a security person make sure she does not enter. Have a list and only those with an invitation are allowed to enter your ceremony and reception. If her name is not on the list she is not allowed to come in. It would be much better for you to pay for a security person instead of a 'phone check' person for your own pieces of mind. I would also contact all of your vendors and have them password protected so she cannot try to change or cancel anything on you. Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials and may you be the first to finally put her in her place so hopefully she will not cross other boundaries in the future.

We held hands, did a kiss, and then pretended that a random male friend \"objected\" while the Maid of honor fainted and a fight ensued. After that whole play, we asked to not take photos and block anyone's view. Our guest all got a kick out of it, and complied. We had our tea ceremony afterwards, and many people were asking the bridal party if it was okay taking pics. It totally was-- its just a different thing that didn't have a \"MC\".
