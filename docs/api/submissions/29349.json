When she tries to come into the venue have a security person make sure she does not enter. Have a list and only those with an invitation are allowed to enter your ceremony and reception. If her name is not on the list she is not allowed to come in. It would be much better for you to pay for a security person instead of a 'phone check' person for your own pieces of mind.

We held hands, did a kiss, and then pretended that a random male friend \"objected\" while the Maid of honor fainted and a fight ensued. After that whole play, we asked to not take photos and block anyone's view. Our guest all got a kick out of it, and complied. We had our tea ceremony afterwards, and many people were asking the bridal party if it was okay taking pics. It totally was-- its just a different thing that didn't have a \"MC\".

It will be great content and she\u2019ll thank you later for it.", "YWNBTA. Why would anyone want paparazzi at their damn wedding. Your aunt sounds awful and I hope someone ruins her favorite outfit at one of these events as a response to her behavior. Sneaky difficult to clean wedding drinks I keep hearing about.", "Obvi you can do whatever you want, it\u2019s your wedding and your party. But I will say these over the top and controlling rules that couples come up with these days are just so\u2026idk\u2026they just give me the ick. I don\u2019t get it. Like at all.  Personally I would never attend any function where I was given such rules and treated like a child. If you don\u2019t trust me enough to observe and respect your wishes re posting/photography etc without stripping me of my personal property, I really shouldn\u2019t be invited in the first place. \n\nNTA, but certainly sitting squarely in Bride/groomzilla territory imo. To each his/her own I guess \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, but if having someone responsible for phones becomes a problem, I'd look into Yondr pouchs (although I'm not sure of the cost or your location).", "Why on earth would you just \"let it go\" ? Deal with her.", "This is a hill to die on.  Her phone will not be at the wedding, she can decide if she is coming herself otherwise.   If I saw her at the wedding with a phone after that the phone would not leave intact either.", "Nta", "People use \u201cset a boundary\u201d wrong. Boundaries are what you set on yourself.  Not rules to impose on others.  Weddings are supposed to be hosting people to a party. Not forcing an audience to behave m", "Make her sign an NDA. And include that all pictures need to be cleared by the bride and groom at a predetermined time after the wedding. Any leaked photos from the wedding or reception will result in her footing the bill for the entire wedding and honeymoon plus emotional distress penalty. Have a lawyer draw it up. LOL", "Your wedding.", "This just proves you have an attachment to your phone, an unhealthy one at least.", "This is childish.", "I don't understand how this got so many upvotes. If a couple doesn't want mobiles at their wedding then they have the right to set that boundary.", "Yep same happened to me. There were two photographers. One was great the other not so much. Not a single decent photo of me walking down the aisle with my dad. Thank goodness for my friends who also took photos.", "As a guest I wouldn't feel comfortable  attending a large event where nobody has access to a phone in case of emergency. Confiscating everyones phones over one person is overkill.", "I think you\u2019re missing the point. I sympathize with you over the terrible aunt and I\u2019m sure everyone else does too, but you should not penalize everyone who *can* behave respectfully and who might have a good reason why surrendering their phone is problematic because your partner\u2019s aunt is awful. \n\nYou\u2019re still going to have the confrontation with her anyway by the sound of it so what will your \u2018no phones\u2019 rule accomplish besides inconveniencing and insulting others?", "There are so many reasons to need a phone. There's no way I would comply. You're not more important than babysitters and medical monitoring. People aren't complaining, but they don't necessarily think you're right either.", "Just uninvite the aunt.  She\u2019s going to try to sneak pics no matter what.  She\u2019ll bring a back up phone or some other type of camera.", "It hasn\u2019t been a thing since you needed to get your film developed.", "Technically they are wedding :)", "Just uninvite her even were she to suddenly pretend to go along and hand over a phone it\u2019d likely be a fake. Her refusal to part with her phone makes it clear your wishes won\u2019t be respected. Even if by some miracle she doesn\u2019t picture the ceremony then odds are the day after she\u2019ll have posted nearly the entire reception", "You have your answer. It's a win win and no Brainer, one you aren't treating the rest of your guests like children, two you don't have to babysit an aunt.\n\nJust uninvite her", "So\u2019s expecting to turn someone else\u2019s wedding into a photshoot for da \u2018gram.", "In the schools which have a \"no phone during the classes\" policy, sometimes kids are handing down some old phones without sim card and sneaking \"the proper one\" into the classroom.   \nAunt could be so sneaky, too.", "There are plenty of reasons people might not want to be without their phone. It might be a work device that you are responsible for. They are full of personal data. They are worth a lot of money and could get lost, stolen or damaged. I have a caring responsibility for a disabled person and I would not be comfortable being out of touch for hours.  It\u2019s not necessarily that you can\u2019t stay of tik tok.", "Exactly.", "They have the right to ask people to keep them out of sight and turn the sound off, confiscating them is bonkers.", "There\u2019s a difference between asking your guests not to be on their phones, take pictures and post from your wedding (totally fine) and asking you to hand your phone in at the door (not fine imho).", "Because people like to put their personal feelings in it as if it is somehow an attack on *them*.", "If my kids aren't with me, you can damn well bet I'm not giving up my phone.", "It is if your kids are with a babysitter. They have an issue with one person. That person should be asked to leave their phone not punish everyone else.", "This is my issue. I'm fine asking people to not use their phones during the ceremony (I did this myself), and some of the other requests. I'm happy to generally respect those rules. But I'm not handing over my $500 device bc your aunt is incapable of acting like an adult. Rescind her invite bc she's the one creating an issue.", "I don't even have an excuse like babysitters or medical needs. My reason is simply it's my phone and no, you cannot take it from me. It's not bc I need to be on my phone all the time -- I'm happy to respect the rules, but I'm not letting you confiscate it bc it's not yours to take.", "Leave it in your car or home then", "If you absolutely must work while you're at a wedding, You can easily leave it locked in your car or kept safe with an attendant, whose job at the wedding is to keep the phones safe not steal or break them, then plan to check it every 15 minutes or so. The post literally states that all you need to do is check the phone out when you need it, and back in at your convenience. The entire point of an unplugged wedding is that the reception and ceremony is kept phone free, mostly for the same reason OP stated or to just have a single day of disconnect from the constant bombardment of social media in our day to day lives. If you must use your phone to check up on someone or work throughout the wedding, stay at the back of the crowd so as to not disturb anyone else. Nobody is trying to lock your phone away from 10am to 6pm so that you can't use it, you can easily go outside to check it, or make calls, and hand it back when you re-enter. It's an easy rule to follow and it only takes a couple minutes at most to be able to check your phone. The wedding party has every right to impose this rule and if you cannot be without your phone, you may have to miss the wedding.\n\nYou could even notify the phone attendant that your phone may go off if there is an emergency and ask them to bring it to you discretely if that happens.", "OP mentioned that there will be secure parking\n\nSo if guests don't want to give phones to the attendant, they can lock them up in the car (trunk or other place out of sight) and not worry about the phone getting handled by a stranger.", "It is. In this day and age is really controlling and ridiculous.", "Totally. Phones aren\u2019t just phones and cameras.", "I mean I get it. I'm not even saying I could give up mine. Just throwing things out there. And honestly? A situation like this would probably be an exception. \n\nThe bigger issue here is that aunt. She should just not be invited and everyone else can just do what they do", "This is also not an \"inconvenience\". That's literally what I commented on. That particular word. Need for survival is not the same as an inconvenience.", "Okay. Lol. The phone would literally be in another room. How did generations before survive.", "I've said that about 14 times. I invite the aunt. But if she isn't going to then guests can deal or not go. That's it.", "Yeah, I\u2019m wondering about the logistics of this\u2014who\u2019s keeping track of pretty expensive devices and ensuring that no one either accidentally or intentionally walks off with the wrong one at the end of the evening? That sounds like a nightmare to try to keep track of.", "I don't personally have a reason either, but I feel the same. There are legit reasons for some folks, though. I don't get what weddings have become honestly.", "Or I could just keep it on silent, in my bag, and check it discreetly myself, not taking photos as requested, like the grown adult that I am.", "I see no attacks.", "But would you be at work if you're at a wedding?", "They survived fine. But I'm an adult and I'm not the problem, the aunt is. Uninvite her and let the rest of us keep our $300-1,200 devices in our possession, and trust us to act like adults.", "In prior generations an entire wedding would be interrupted to get ahold of the parents. Phones are more convenient and discreet than how things were done in the past.", "Generations before didn\u2019t have indoor plumbing. Should we forego modern conveniences and shit outside as well?", "Yea but im not reading all 14 of your comments. I replied to this one and answered your specific question. If you had read my other comment you would see i already said op was NTA.", "You could also just not go if you can't abide by any kind of rules.  And you call yourself an adult.", "You\u2019re whining an awful lot about a hypothetical situation for a grown adult", "I don't disagree with that. That's my stance. But the solution is no one goes.\n\nAnd we can all have opinions where we insert all these scenarios. Well ok a meteor may hit and we all blow up. \n\nThing is. The judgement is on this as particular situation. She may have exceptions. Our personal actions aren't at play bc we arent invited. If that the case? I just wouldn't go. I wouldn't whine and cry. I wouldn't go. If I had a medical reason, I would ask and accept it. \n\nLife's too short to make federal cases of everything.\n\nI've done plenty of things where they collected phones if no medical reason. We could go get them if needed. \n\nEveryone agreed or didn't go.", "Okay. But this post is about this person and this situation. The phones are not getting locked away forever. If you need it? Excuse yourself and go use it", "Obviously. Seeing as that's a logical analogy b", "Okay. So same goes for you.", "So you\u2019re a bride who did this to her guests. Or plans to. I agree with her that I wouldn\u2019t want to be without my phone. The fact that I\u2019m addicted is my choice. I might want to check sports scores, news, work emails -\nwhatever I want. I don\u2019t need to have a reason. And I\u2019m not running in and out like a smoker. I would skip the wedding. It\u2019s controlling and ridiculous.  I think it\u2019s a clear sign guests will treated as props to \u201ctheir day\u201d versus GUESTS.  I would expect food, music, everything, to suck. Speeches will be too long.  Other activities will take forever.  Because it\u2019s all about their day.  All eyes on us!!!", "Right, but you also asked how previous generations did it, so people are answering your (likely sarcastic, rhetorical ) question.\n\nAnd again, how can I know if I need to use it, when I don't have it on me? I agree with everyone else, and what you seem to be too dense to want to agree with, treat the aunt as the child and allow everyone else to act like the adults they are.", "Im just answering the question you posed. I already commented that i agree op is NTA but i also think they should just uninvite this aunt and be done with it.", "Awww. Name calling. So sweet.\n\nHad you bothered to read any other comments you'd see I said quite a few times that disinviting the aunt was the way to go. But she's not going to it seems. So all these other littler personal anecdotes don't matter. None of us are going. \n\nShe made the rule. They can go or not. Is she an asshole for making the rule? I don't care. That wasn't the judgement. She would not be an asshole for disinviting her aunt who can't follow the rule. That isn't hard to understand.", "I agree"]}
