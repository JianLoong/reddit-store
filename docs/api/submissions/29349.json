We have been engaged for several years and due to some life circumstances we have had a reaaaaally long engagement, which to be honest has actually been a blessing.\n\nAnyways, our family and friends have all been excited since we finally set a date and of course, so we are also excited to finally celebrate our day. Now my Aunt in Law is a bit of a socialite who does not respect people\u2019s boundaries especially if it gets in the way of her creating content. She has been to a number of weddings and because \u201cit\u2019s good content\u201d she has taken many photos of the bride and posted them straight away not caring that some of these photos aren\u2019t so flattering of the bride and the couple had not posted their wedding photos first (this became a pretty big blow out argument cause she read the message exchange to me). \n\nMy partner and I have agreed that we want an unplugged ceremony and because I have no faith that she won\u2019t try to sneak her phone into the ceremony I said I\u2019d like it if all phones were kept in a designated area where we have assigned a person to manage them being signed in & out. My partner agreed and was more than happy to go along with the plan.\n\nWe\u2019ve told everyone, no complaints, people understood\u2026. All but the Aunt\u2026.

She isn't going to be able to resist posting photos and videos.\n\nNow with that problem solved, allow your guests to manage their own phones. Tell them the rules of no wedding photos and include it in your invitations. I wouldn't take peoples phones away and make them sign them out. I also wouldn't want to be responsible for their phones in case of loss. You're taking responsibility for that and will be liable if something happens. \n\nJust treat everyone like adults and inform them in advance what you expect. I know that I have a sickly father in law who we need to be in contact with. We even bought him a life alert because of falls and we've had several incidents. I wouldn't dream of taking pics and posting to social media because I'm an adult and have self control, and I also need my phone on me 24/7 unfortunately.", "**Dear Aunt. Our wedding is unplugged.

You are requesting this of everyone.  If she can\u2019t follow the request you set then she can\u2019t come.  In this day of constant distraction I think this is a great idea.  I could see if someone said hey I\u2019m leaving my kids with a babysitter and need them to be able to reach me but that\u2019s not the case here.", "NTA. Just don't invite her.

I\u2019d just uninvite her now because it\u2019s pretty clear she isn\u2019t going to respect your boundaries.", "NTA, she's pretty much told you to screw your request and without saying explicitly she will be using her phone \"for content\" as you suspect.\n\nTell her then she's not invited, anyone asks don't hesitate on sharing that she's there only one who apparently can't reply with the signing phones in request until wherever they get them back as such.\n\nMe personally if i6 was told but to take photos at a wedding with my phone then you're sure as hell I wouldn't, but you're playtng it safe.\n\nI would even go as far as if said aunt is uninvited from the wedding, have someone on the door to stop her showing up anyway.
