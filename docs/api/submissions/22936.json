We agreed as she sent this average priced restaurant to us a month before. A week before the dinner, she sends us the menu and it's a different place. This new place is $150 pp plus tip, very expensive, my boyfriend and I live two hours away from her, so we were hesitant as this is a lot of money to spend but I know her birthday means a lot to her so I confirmed. She is quite an up front person and also asked me for this expensive pair of boots as a birthday gift. I told her I would try but they are quite expensive.\nMy boyfriend was upset and said she is asking a lot out of a friend for a birthday gift.\nA week before the dinner, she sends an email saying please confirm as this restaurant charges $50 pp per cancellation if cancelled in less than 48 hours. I was starting to feel unwell, on top of that my boyfriend was rubbed the wrong way (the gift, the drive, the dinner price) so i told her that we cannot make it but to call the restaurant and to see if they won't charge her as we are cancelling. (This was 4 days before the dinner)\nShe was annoyed that we were cancelling and she told me they never got back to her but she's almost certain she needs to pay because it\u2019s a custom menu or something?\n\nThe day of, I felt bad and apologized and I sent her $100 and said this is for our cancellation so you don't need to pay the fee. The dinner passes, and I haven\u2019t heard anything so I assumed they charged her and she used the money to pay.\n\nHOWEVER, I am petty and I wanted revenge on this restaurant for this stupid policy of theirs. I left a review explaining the situation. The restaurant manager gets back to me and asks for more information. I give them the information and they send me the receipt showing nobody got charged for missing people from the reservation.\n\nSo l was confused, as if this was me, I would let my friend know and send the money back. \n\nI wanted to give my friend a chance to admit this, so I waited a couple of days and eventually mentioned it to her saying, \u201cHey, I hope all went well, did they end up charging you for us not being there?\" She said yes they did (not knowing I had the receipt for her bill) so I told her I wrote a review and the restaurant manager let me know she wasn't charged. She kept denying it, but I had the proof of an actual receipt.\n\nThis is a close friend of 10 years so this whole situation was a slap in the face. However it has been 10 months and I haven't seen her or hardly spoke to her to this day. Some of my other friends say it's too long of a friendship to let money damage it, however for me it goes deeper than the money. It is the principal of lying and deceiving me into feeling really bad about not attending and then dishonestly taking the money. I never thought I was the type of person to even get into a fight around money because it seems frivolous.", "created_utc": 1690094440, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1577asu/aita_for_ruining_a_10_year_friendship_over_money/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her behaviour was disgusting and you are better off without her.", "NTA! You tried and she lied. Trust in a friendship is important. She clearly doesn\u2019t get that and the fact that she did you dirty. It\u2019s best to walk away and distance yourself. Toxic people will only hold you back.", "NTA. It only cost you 100 bucks to find out she\u2019s not a good friend. Saved a lifetime of drama.", "No frivolity involved at all, your \"friend' tried to steal $100 from you.  As I read the story I was kind of wondering where you were, I've not heard of a $50 cancellation fee, if a restaurant is that good they wouldn't need it.\n\nYou did not in the least ruin the friendship, your \"friend\" showed her true colors, believe her and wish her well in her future endeavors.

How asks for expensive booths for a birthday present? From a friend? A teen from a parent might be possible, or from a spose. But from a friend and just for a random birthday?", "This fight's not about money. It's about respect of your time, your budget. It's about her integrity. You can't trust her anymore. She money grabbed from you, and that feels icky no matter how much it was. And it would be one thing if it was true, but when you called her on it, she lied. Some friendships run their course. This one just did. NTA.", "NTA  Wow, she really wanted to be Princess for a day.", "NTA. She let money damage it. Also said \u201cfriend\u201d is very entitled. Does she reciprocate the gifts? Would you even feel comfortable asking her for an expensive gift or to be treated to an expensive restaurant on her dime on your birthday?", "NTA. Your user friend ripped you off for $100. Good riddance to bad rubbish. You didn't ruin the friendship - she did for basically stealing your hard-earned money.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA.\n\nFirst, your friend sounds really entitled to expect you to get her an expensive gift while making you and your bf pay $300 plus tax & tip for a dinner you have to travel hours in for. Does she give you something of equivalent monetary or effort value for your birthday?\n\nSecondly, she\u2019s a big liar to keep denying the $100 charge even after you straight up ask her about it. Her honesty and integrity as a friend isn\u2019t even worth $100?\n\nThis fight isn\u2019t about money but her entitlement as a friend and her dishonesty even when confronted with evidence. If she\u2019s not willing to own up to it, I think your friendship won\u2019t survive long based on differences in character and value so you might as well start distancing yourself from this \u201cfriendship\u201d sooner rather than later.", "NTA and I'm surprised you can't see that. Like is she the queen bee and you've been under her thumb since high school so you can't figure out she's been a shit friend all these years? \n\n1. No one has the right to send you a gift request, especially something expensive. You want a cute trinket? Sure. But no friend of mine would dare pull this shit unless I ask them what they want. And even then, I've never had a friend tell me they want anything expensive. \n\n2. $150/person meal? With a customized menu for her birthday? Jfc. Unless you're all from rich families or have amazing jobs that pay well, this is bananas. \n\n3. She lied about the cancellation and that they charged her. When you paid her, she should have said the restaurant let it slide. You had to catch her in the lie. No real friend would take your money and let you feel guilty when they didn't get charged. \n\n4. Your other friends are also garbage. The relationship isn't damaged/over because of money; it's damaged/over because your supposed best friend is a lying, entitled AH. \n\nAlso, you're slightly an AH for that review to the restaurant in the first place. Cancellation charges are becoming common. Several restaurants I go to have a $25/person reservation fee refunded upon your arrival for your reservation. The reason being it's hard to fill a seat when someone doesn't show up. Why would you complain? It's your friend's fault for not informing you ahead of time, not the restaurant's fault for having a known cancellation policy.", "What else does she lie to you about? If she expects you to attend an expensive dinner plus bring an expensive present, would you be expected to contribute/ cover her dinner too? \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve outgrown this friendship. Also, I hope you deleted your review!", "She\u2019s really not a friend. I hope you know that already. Friends don\u2019t do that to each other", "NTA. You have (had) an extremely entitled friend who was demanding that you spend $300 + travel expenses + the cost of some expensive boots for her, too?!?! And she was SERIOUS?!?!?!\n\nI know it's hard to watch this relationship crumble after all these years. I'm sure it meant something to you at some points ... but, honestly, was she this entitled the whole time? If so, then I'd say you dodged a bullet when this relationship ended now. Imagine what she'd be demanding as she got older and her tastes got more expensive! A fur coat? A car?!?!\n\nGrieve (because I know you'll need to) and then say good riddance! And good luck finding much more reasonable friends. They're out there!", "What kind of friends demands these things from another friend?  The fact that she wanted you to drive 2 hours to drop $300 and to buy her expensive shoes?? The she lies about the cancellation fee. That seems crazy to me.  I hope you didn\u2019t get her those shoes!  I  don\u2019t think your are as close as you think\u2026 NTA", "NTA", "You didn\u2019t ruin a 10 year friendship, you just found out how slimy she is.  Good riddance. It sucks about the money but ur better off without her. NTA", "Gee, my friends don't steal money from me and then lie when they get caught.  NTA.", "NTA  You can no longer trust her.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done something similar to this, either. I had a similar situation with my best friend from kindergarten. When we were 21 she asked me to loan her $350 so she could buy a baby crib. I had no idea how outrageous that was for just a crib at the time, but either way she said she would pay it back when she got paid next. Once she got paid, she had every excuse in the book as to why she couldn\u2019t pay it back. She even gave me her bank card and pin one day so I could go to an ATM and withdraw the money myself, but she knew the whole time that she had no money in the bank. 8 years later and I still haven\u2019t been paid back. I\u2019m not friends with her anymore obviously. It\u2019s not the money, it\u2019s the lying and deception.", "NTA\n\nShe let money ruin the friendship. NOT YOU.\n\nShe did by SCAMMING you out of your money after LYING to you about it to your face.\n\nOn top of that she wanted you to spend an arm, a leg and your first born for JUST her birthday present and meal.\n\nNot your friend. Doesn't seem like she ever was.", "NTA, you are well rid of that greedy, stealing liar.", "*You* didn't ruin the friendship, and it wasn't about money. Your \"friend\" is an AH.", "NTA - you just caught her this time.", "NTA. The hundred bucks ain\u2019t nothing to throw a friendship away over but that ain\u2019t what\u2019s making you walk away. The selfishness, rudeness, manipulation and deceit is what is making you walk away. Those are all characteristics and none of them are good. Why would you want to surround yourself with people who behave that way? Sounds like you\u2019re making healthy choices to me.", "YOU are not the one who damaged the friendship over money!! Your acquaintance STOLE from you and LIED to you to get YOUR money!! That is not a friend, that is a thief!! Stop feeling bad because you want to have autonomy over the money you earn! And never speak to this person again nor anyone who thinks YOU damaged this friendship.", "NTA\u2026.you did not let money change your friendship.  You let a liar and a thief change the status of your relationship.", "You cancelled ahead of the window for the fee. \n\n\nIt ended there.  \n\n\nYou brought the rest on yourself.", "NTA. \n\nSometimes you need to cut toxic people out of your life. \n\nShe doesn't sound like a friend. More like trash don't invite her back into your life", "NTA, you aren\u2019t the one that let money interfere with your friendship, she did.", "This isn\u2019t ruined over money. This was ruined over her selfishness and deceit. \n\nNTA.", "She didn\u2019t get charged she should have given the money back Yes I would drop her as a friend I don\u2019t care how long I am friends with them you lie I am done no second chances.", "She didn't try and steal from OP, she stole 100.00...apparently OP's \"value\" as a friend was 100.00...", "Here in Manhattan it's not uncommon for a restaurant to charge a cancellation fee, but the restaurants are very expensive. The fees range from $50 to $225 per person.", "One of the best restaurants i know has one. They have so much demand, is i think the reason. Im pretty sure they would be reasonable if you had a good reason though. \n\nIt works as a deposit that you don\u2019t get back if you cancel within 24 hours. Theirs is $15 per person though.", "Sigzigixgizgisgisgzigzigisgizggisigsigsigzigsigsigisgzigsiggisigisgisgisissigsisigzigisgsigzigsigisgisgisgsigsigsigisgisgsigissizigsigsigsigigigigio", "Yeah, specifically for the cancellation fee, I think that's fair. I've worked in places where we lost thousands in sales because we were turning down bookings/walk ins and multiple large bookings showed up with half the number, smaller bookings didn't show up at all etc. \n\nOP is NTA for calling off the friendship over it, but she shouldn't have called out the restaurant for such a policy.", "I live in Manhattan and had made plenty of reservations on Resy that have these $25pp cancellation fees but they usually allow you to cancel for free with 24hr of notice.", "I' was at a really expensive place in Las Vegas, it was $15 also.  $50................seems like a made up number or really excessive, even after the Pandemic.  I don't think anyone is going to be charging $50 for a cancellation, especially if they are any good.", "Yea, the amount is just supposed to discourage booking multiple restaurants and cancelling on the day. $50 is excessive.", "I just got back from vacation and all of the restaurants charged cancellation fees. Two places were $50/pp.", "I was actually thinking it was a lie, being overly excessive."]}
