She (34F) brought her two children (6f and 3m) with. She's 3 time zones ahead of me. \n\nMy wife (21F) and I have decided not to have kids yet for the express reason of wanting to enjoy being married and having some freedom before we bring kids into the picture. Since we only have dogs, the only locks in our house are on exterior doors and the bathrooms. No bedrooms have them.\n\nThe first morning that they were staying with us, her son wanted to play with my dogs which stay in my room with my wife and me at night time. Being 3, he just opened the door to let them out and caused the dogs to bark all morning as they played with him. This occurred at 6:30am. I got up, rather annoyed and closed the door and layed back down. 5 minutes layer, he came and opened the door again so I got up, told him 'Nephew, no. Do not open my door', closed it, and layed down again.\n\nAnother five minutes went by and he did it a third time, so I walked out and looked at my sister and said \"can you please control your son and stop him from opening our door\". She chuckled and I went back to bed for the final time.\n\nA few days later, she mentioned that it was unreasonable for me to be upset about the situation stating 'his other aunts and uncles don't get upset about it' and I should be more understanding because he's only 3.

If she was watching him then she could ensure that he wasn\u2019t opening a door of a married couple. She would have been real angry if he would have walked in on a morning love session.", "NTA. When you are visiting someone, you are not violating host's house rules and lifestyle. And your kids are your responsibility. If they wake up early - you wake up early and quietly play with them. If you cannot do it, you should stay in the hotel and visit for hour or two.", "NTA\n\nYour sister knows her kids schedules.  She should be supervising her children early in the morning and arranging a quiet activity until you are up.    \nThis seems like a communication issue.", "Of course NTA. Your sister needs to start acting like a responsible parent.", "NTA\n\nIts the parent's responsibility to watch over and have some control over children's behaviors, especially when they're still so young and don't understand much. Imagine if son walked in on a steamy morning session indeed??? Parent gotta teach and train good behavior while they're young instead of being so overly accommodating.", "NTA. While it\u2019s normal for a 3 year old not to know social manners, he won\u2019t learn these manners unless someone tells him and then enforces expectations. Saying he shouldn\u2019t be chastised because he\u2019s only three is a guarantee to have poor behavior at older ages.", "NTA. You have every right to wake her up and ask her to be awake when he's doing stuff. What happens if he gets into trouble in another way - eg. turning unfamiliar switches, getting knocked over by your dog, whatever?", "NTA\nSince 3 yo can't know how to behave, adults have to supervise them. Adults that supervise them can then teach them how to behave. \"No, kiddo, we don't open other people's bedroom doors\".", "NTA. Guess your sister will need to find somewhere else to stay next time.", "NTA. Tell her they can stay with those other aunts and uncles in the future.", "Nta . They should not have stayed with you", "Lol NTA", "NTA, it's not the kids fault or yours, he is 3 and can't understand limits that's why it's your sisters responsibility to teach him some. You have the right to be upset but at your sister, not him. She should also learn to control her son (unless she wants to have a troublemaking kid). Maybe you should get some locks in the near future for more privacy lol", "You are not the AH. It's understandable that you were annoyed by the early morning disturbance caused by your sister's son.   \n\n\nWhile it's true that a 3-year-old child may not understand the concept of privacy and personal boundaries, your sister should have made an effort to supervise her child and ensure he didn't disturb you and your wife.   \n\n\nAs a guest in your home, it's important that she respects your rules and expectations, especially since you have no locks on your bedroom doors.   \n\n\nIt's also reasonable for you to expect some peace and quiet in the morning, especially since you have dogs that sleep in your room.   \n\n\nYour sister's response was dismissive, and it's unfortunate that she didn't take your concerns seriously.", "No idea why I see people saying E S H. They are wrong. Plainly so\n\nSister is being lazy as hell in regards to her parenting, and frankly she\u2019s heavily at fault here because she taught her kid that is is fine to open doors without permission. All the aunts and uncles are fine with it? I broke the X button with the doubt I have for that. \n\nI\u2019d make it clear she isn\u2019t welcome to stay over night any more after this visit. She wants to allow her kids free reign in someone else\u2019s home, then this is the best way to show her what the consequences will look like once the rest of the family start having to deal with it proper\n\nNTA", "NTA. At all. I\u2019m constantly amazed at the way the population that has made a concious decision to have children, expect everyone else around them to adapt to their chosen lifestyle. And que the entitlement when asked for the same courtesy, especially when in your child free home. It would be different if you were visiting them, which of course you then expect to adapt to their lifestyle. \n\nLegit lost a 25 year friendship over a friend bringing her two very rowdy toddlers to my child free home and absolutely destroying everything in their path. Mom was a participant\u2026changed diapers on my brand new couch, jumping on said couch with shoes on, snacks in hand, let them smear mac n cheese all over my table/chairs, and the list goes on. The last straw was when her 3yo kicked my puppy (deliberately), and I yelled at him. Gentle parenting allows for kids to abuse animals without any consequences. Ya know what though, I got called a child abuser for yelling at an innocent child. Time for you guys to pack up and go.", "NYA - at 3 he should know the word no. Training her son is her responsibility", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is a shitty guest. Don't let her stay with you again.", "I'm going to say ESH. Her son might not have a concept of privacy yet (nor can he, realistically), but your sister should have respected your wish for it and told him. Also, you are not your aunts and uncles and your sister should realise that. \n\nBut then again, they're kids. Kids wake up early and they make noise. I think what would happen in an ideal world is: you accept that kids make noise in the morning. Your sister should teach their kids that you knock before you enter a room.", "YTA - that\u2019s why you get locks", ">I feel she should have made an effort to stop her children from making so much noise early in the morning.\n\nI agree. But also OP that's impossible at 3 years old. Any effort she extended to try and make him quieter in the morning would only be out of politeness and trying to reinforce future habits. I doubt it would have *actually worked*.\n\nAnyway ESH because she should have tried anyway, but you also could have asked her politely instead of \"control your child\" phrasing.", "yta it\u2019s not her sons fault you decided to not have locks on your doors and also kids are going to wake up early in the morning they can\u2019t control that.", "YTA, maybe you should control your dog to not bark while playing.", "ESH. she can put forth some extra effort to keep him from opening your door and possibly focus on quiet games to keep the kids occupied, but no one is gonna be able to safely keep a three year old from making noise. \n\nif you don't want the annoyances of kids in your home, don't let kids stay with you. that's a boundary you are allowed to set as a childfree person. children are going to act like children. even jean piaget wouldn't be able to control them to your liking.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not normal to have locks on bedroom doors so that\u2019s a non issue and the being awake early wasn\u2019t the issue either, it was constantly opening their door when the sister wasn\u2019t stopping them or even trying to distract the kid.
