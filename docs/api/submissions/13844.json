At all. I\u2019m constantly amazed at the way the population that has made a concious decision to have children, expect everyone else around them to adapt to their chosen lifestyle.

It would be different if you were visiting them, which of course you then expect to adapt to their lifestyle. \n\nLegit lost a 25 year friendship over a friend bringing her two very rowdy toddlers to my child free home and absolutely destroying everything in their path. Mom was a participant\u2026changed diapers on my brand new couch, jumping on said couch with shoes on, snacks in hand, let them smear mac n cheese all over my table/chairs, and the list goes on. The last straw was when her 3yo kicked my puppy (deliberately), and I yelled at him. Gentle parenting allows for kids to abuse animals without any consequences.

The OP may have been able to sleep (big maybe, lol) if guests were up attending to their own needs. Breakfast. Anything. Kids and dogs are a noisy mix but having a kid repeatedly open the bedroom door with no attempt by mom to deal with it is beyond the pale. \n\nYou are absolutely correct, the guests should not have stayed there. The mom sounds like one of those moms that find some sort of superiority over others and use their tolerance for kid sound/messes/destructiveness as evidence of their superiority. The fact that the mom was still ruminating about OP telling her to care for her kid seems to support the Mother Superior theory.\n\nGentle YTA, OP because after the 2nd door opening incident seizing the day and taking the dog to a dog park to avoid the morning madness would have been better for all concerned, including the dog. Instead you asked someone to get up and take care of their kid when clearly their routine is kid up running around while mom sleeps a bit more. Never correct someone\u2019s kid.
