She freaks out if she gains weight, even though she is underweight for someone her age and height (and she is quite short among her peers). She constantly compares her appearance to those of others, and spends way too much exercising, and is obsessed with how many steps she takes each day.\n\nYesterday my mom made dinner. The food is very hard to reheat, so she expected that we would all finish what she cooked. She gave each person an equal, reasonable portion. My sister took a few bites and didn't want to eat any more. She went several minutes without eating, just poking the food. When my mom asked her if she's going to continue eating, she said that she ate enough, even though it was no more than 5 bites. She said that she doesn't want to get fat, it's way too much protein, and that she didn't take enough steps, so she can't eat too much. My parents are concerned about my sister's eating habits, but after some argument, they let her go to her room.\n\nNow they asked me to eat the rest of her meal, even though the portion she gave is just right for me. I offered to split her leftovers three ways, but my mom said that since she and my dad are in their 50s, they should limit how much they eat at night, but since I'm still young and need energy, I should eat the rest of it. Now I'm in great shape and I'm physically active, but I explained that I really didn't feel like eating too much, since the food is filling and dense. She got impatient and said that the food can't be reheated, so it has to be eaten by someone, and the best candidate is me. I said that my sister didn't finish it tonight, so she should eat the rest of it the next day. Then my dad said that the food cannot be reheated without tasting weird, and that as the older child and the guy I should do what I can to please and respect my sister and my parents- and that means finishing her food.\n\nI got mad and ranted that I'm forced in countless ways to \"please\" my sister, from being yelled at to finish showering so she could take a 30-minute shower, to not being allowed to play my musical instrument at home because she doesn't like the sound of it. I said that I'm not eating her leftovers unless I'm still hungry after finishing my plate (which is unlikely), and that she should eat her leftovers tomorrow. My parents got furious and said that I'm being a terrible adult, and that they can't let this happen to her.", "created_utc": 1672593644, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100o9bo/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_my_sisters_leftovers/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
