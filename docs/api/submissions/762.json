We are very different though, we've already tried to talk about our interests, but we acknowledged that we don't align.\nAnyways, at the beginning of this year she moved cities to study, while me and our other friends stayed in our hometown to either study at the local university or work. Since then she has been coming back and forth to visit family and to hangout with our group of friends. The only problem as of late, is that she has been ditching us to go on dates with guys. I don't have a problem with her goin on dates, but she has repeatedly put our friendship aside, and when we manage to hang out she can only talk about them, or only takes interest in the conversation when it is about the guys that she is seeing. I got a bit upset by this, and i'm not really interested in talking about guys or dates all the time.I've already said that to her and she did not take that well.\nSince then, we have been a bit hostile w/ one another and easily get into fights. The last time we met was the last drop though.\nWe had a really big fight because of the same issue,this time she wanted me and other friend to accompany her to go see a guy she's been hooking up while we were hanging. We said no and she complained that we never want to do what she wants to do, left mad and blocked me. Afterwards, she unblocked me, I tried to reach out to apologize but we just ended up fighting again. The last thing I sent her was that I thought we needed to stop talking for awhile.\nI'm not gonna lie, i kinda feel guilty for not being able to cater to her interests, but is not something I can help it, it bores me to talk about one subject only. I also feel bad for the way I spoke with her last time. Besides, this time she only came back to her parents house bc she needed to take some time off uni cause her mental health has been declining, and she says that dating helps, but idk. Lately I've been thinking a lot if I really want to go back to talking to her, there's all these reasons ( no interests in common, end up having boring conversations, fighting,etc), and I feel like we are probably gonna fight about the same thing if we come back to good terms.\nSo, Am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1667337223, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjlkol/aita_for_not_wanting_to_speak_to_my_friend_anymore/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like you're just growing apart...you didn't have a solid friendship foundation, anyway (the way you describe it). Might be time to downgrade her from \"friend\" to \"friendly acquaintance.\"", "ESH.  Did your school not teach proper grammar or indentation?", "NTA. Don't feel bad for not wanting to be her third wheel. It sounds like she only hung out with you guys because she couldn't see her boyfriend.\n\nIt was actually really rude of her to demand that you guys go with her to hang out with her boyfriend and then get nasty when you didn't want to. Nobody wants to be a third wheel, and you would have been really bored.\n\nAlso, she has it backwards. If she is depressed and having mental problems, the last thing she needs is to go on constant dates with guys."]}
