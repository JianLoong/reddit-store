My parents never cared much mainly because my dad never came home till late cause he was out getting drunk and my mum didn\u2019t give a shit. But these girls gave me so much trauma and PTSD that i was in therapy for 4 years and still go. \n\nHere\u2019s how my brother (27M) gets involved he told me a year ago he was dating someone but never told me who but we never spoke that much since he moved out he then started to speak to me more and gain more contact so i asked to see his new girlfriend cause he told me things were getting serious and he was considering proposing. So he tell me to come to this cafe one day to meet her then i walk to the cafe and see him and a woman who isn\u2019t faced towards me sitting down i go sit next to her and recognise her i freeze and ask her for her name she says Amy and  i don\u2019t even look at my brother and leave i had a panic attack as soon as i went home cause of all the flashbacks i started getting. I checked my phone after i calmed myself and saw about 15 missed calls and loads of texts from my brother saying \u201cgive her a chance\u201d and \u201cshe has changed\u201d i blocked him and told my other brother (26M) all about it and he told me he couldn\u2019t believe she was the girl he had engaged. I was confused and said they weren\u2019t engaged yet and he said they were throwing an engagement party soon i told my brother (26M) i was going to go no - contact if my other brother didn\u2019t break up with her he agreed and said he would do the same. \n\nSo i called my brother (27M) that if he didn\u2019t break it off i would never speak to him and not attend his wedding he said i was being to harsh and to get to know her since she \u201cchanged\u201d but i refused and said call me back when you have made up your mind. \n\nNow some of my cousins have been calling me saying that was maybe to harsh so AITH?", "created_utc": 1693325016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164mgco/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As your brother he should have been protective enough of you to not even have talked to her in the first place. I support you going NC 200%", "NTA \n\nSounds like your brother was aware of how this was a possible problem. Then in a sense tried to blindside you to force you to meet his serious girlfriend/fianc\u00e9, all when it would be \u201ctoo late\u201d. It seems like he kept this from you very purposely, KNOWING it the history and how uncomfortable it would be for you. It seems like he was just hoping you would sweep it under the rug, and completely push your feelings aside. You are not obligated to be in anyone\u2019s life who does not care about your own feelings or the consequences of their own actions. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that this happened and I hope that you are doing okay.", "NTA.\nDo not fold and go.\nStay NC.", "NTA\n\nI would also say she hasn\u2019t changed, not really. If Amy had changed then she wouldn\u2019t have let the brother blindside OP like that.\n\nIt felt (like others have said) like they were trying to manipulate OP into sweeping it under the carpet.", "NTA. Not required to forgive or speak to anyone if you don't want to. I was bullied and teased in high school, havent spoken to her in 20+ yrs and still hate her. Karma came around on her, though. Crack head with a crack baby.", "NTA.\n\nBrother knew who she was and knew the level of trauma this girl and her friends visited on his little sister.\n\nHe chose to date Amy knowing this, and now he's choosing to marry her, which is his right to do.\n\nBut he can't choose for OP to stay in his life knowing that she still struggles with what was done to her. It doesn't matter at all how much Amy has supposedly changed. If she'd changed, she would have wanted to apologize to OP as soon as they started dating, not wait until a proposal. \n\nOP still bears the mental and emotional scars of what was done to her by the woman he supposedly loves. He's actively choosing Amy over OP, now it's OP's turn to make a decision here by cutting him off permanently.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur reaction is reasonable.", "NTA.\n\nI am so sorry this is happening to you. He had a choice of literally 7billion other people and choose one of 3 that hurt you. No matter what stand your ground, you don\u2019t deserve to experience PTSD because he has no taste in a partner. And if anyone calls you the AH they\u2019re just showing that they do not care about you or your feelings. Stay strong and again I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA", "NTA, your brother knew what you had experienced and the trauma they caused you.\nAlso Amy definitely knew what she was doing and who she was dating. She probably thought she could torment you even more once she is related to you.  Your brother will lose his sister and other brother over a woman who is clearly\nA shifty human being. \n\nPlease keep us updated on your brothers\ndecision and I hope your are ok and this does\nnot cause horrible memories.", "NTA, im sorry you were blindsided by such a betrayal. It sounds like your brother made his choice, going N.C. is likely the best decision you can make here. But don't be too surprised if your other brother ends up supporting the marriage after all", "What kind of brother would date sister\u2019s abuser? There\u2019s no grey zone in this case. He knew who she is. For victim and victim\u2019s family (anyone that cared about OP, the brother certainly isn\u2019t one), there\u2019s no EX-abuser. It\u2019s a constant, present fact that Amy is OP\u2019s abuser. The abusive experience seared into victims life experience permanently. It became part of OP\u2019s life. Best case of scenario, they survive it. More than likely, they accept the fact that it happened to them and learn to live with the pain. \n\nThe \u201cpeople can change\u201d mentality is so pale, crass and downright cruel. If brother can demonstrate this degree of cruelty, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worthy relationship to maintain. NC with him and NTA. \n\nAlso, a truly reformed abuser would have the conscience, humility and consideration to not mess with her victims, to rehabilitate her name elsewhere and to leave her victim alone. What a sadist Amy is to date OP\u2019s brother? Maintaining a constant reminder in OP\u2019s life to further deteriorate her mental condition and to enjoy OP in panic attacks? This is so deliberate, with no self awareness the gravity of her past actions. I doubt she \u201cchanged\u201d.", "NTA. In my experience, bullies don't change much. A few might come to regret their actions, but for most of them, it's ingrained in their personality. Your brother was aware of what she did and pursued her anyway. No need to have further contact with either of them. I'm sorry he let you down.", "NTA\n\nYour brother set you up. He knew what your reaction would be, and blindsided you. There were so many ways to introduce you to the idea of dating her, including a long, written apology from her. They didn't do anything except put you in a position where if you didn't play along, some people would think YTA.\n\nFuck these people.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry this is happening to you .", "I know people change and Amy might have changed. But as long as she doesn't apologize sincerely, it is hard to believe she has changed. NTA. I forgave so many things in my life but, this is not one of them. \nBut, you have to change too. You are an adult now and you must move on.", "NTA.  Would be NAH if he had handled it better.  \n\nGoing to be a long lifetime if you think you're going to be able to avoid her forever.", "Wow. If you had fought back just once you wouldn't be such a hot mess but your brother is utter crap.", "ESH.  \n\nHe shouldn't have ambushed you with meeting her.\n\nThat said, I also don't believe in judging people based on what they did when they were 15 years old.  \n\nI do feel like you overreacted.  Not necessarily for walking out.  But deciding to block him and go no contact because you don't get along with this girl?  You are perfectly fine to not go to the wedding, but I do think you are going a bit far with this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Fuck Amy and your brother. \nSaying she has changed only clarifying that he knows what kinda of ashole she is. \n\nKeep us updated", "NTA, and she'll probably invite the other two girls to the wedding too if they're all still friends, and would imagine that they are", "I totally agree!\n\nI suggest you write your brother a letter and put in detail the lasting effects of the bullying that you are experiencing to this day.  Even if she regrets what she did, she doesn't experience the flashbacks and panic attacks.  She does not have ptsd and has not been continually going for therapy for years.  Tell your brother that you love him, but you cannot have a relationship with him if her marries your bully. She may have changed but you carry the scars from her behavior to this day.", "She has - she's moving on to NC.", "If she goes NC with brother then by definition she can avoid his wife.", "I agree with not judging people for what they did when  they were 15... To an extent. But Amy and her friends physically assaulted op on the regular. And no one gave a care except her brothers. They literally had to protect her from being beaten. I would do the same as OP in this situation honestly.", "She got PTSD from their bullying and had a strong reaction to seeing one of them. The brother ambushed her into meeting/accepting his apparently fiancee. He could have made the introductions waaaaaay back and have the gorlfriend try to make up for the past awful mistakes. No, I dont't think OP is taking it too far. I do hope though that they are going to continue therapy as long as they need it.", "'Don't get along'? That's a pretty mild description of more than 5 years of physical and mental abuse. Fifteen is considered pretty close to adulthood and it sounds like none of them, including Amy, ever tried to apologize or make amends. Never speaking to them again is the least they deserve.", "I love this idea", "I agree.  But I would also include a total cost of therapy that I had paid for.  If she was really sorry and had 'changed', then she could at least prove it partially by paying the bill.  But even with $$ it wouldn't get back all those years that have been wasted because of that girl.", "Well, the brother is probably going to Leroy Jenkins the family holidays and events.  She will be NC with more than 2 people.", "Right.  She can go no contact, but that likely would involve a lot of other people too.  Is she going to expect the parents to choose sides at holidays?  Or will she just never see them at any family gatherings.", "Reddit is kind of weird when it comes to families. It seems like people are a lot more prone to conflict with family then society in general is", "It looks like going no contact is the only option that your brother has left you. Did he really expect that you'd welcome his marriage to the woman who made your life hell for 4 years? Is she still friends with the other girls? Would you have to face them at the wedding too? The thought is horrifying. You are NTA but unfortunately your brother is one. I can't imagine even speaking to someone who bullied my sister for years and he's marrying her! WTH is he thinking?", "NTA. He knew exactly who she was and what she did when they started dating. That's why he kept her identity a secret for so long. I bet she loves the fact she is with your brother as another way to hurt you. I dont know how they met but it wouldn't surprise me if she purposely went after him. Go NC and ignore those saying to forgive. Tigers dont change their stripes.", "NTA", "Wonderful suggestion.\n\nWhy her brother thinks she hasn't made up her mind is odd, but I guess he'll figure it out once she follows through on her ultimatum.", "OP has to go NC , for her health.  It's  must do!!!!   4 years of therapy, panic attack (and could have really seriously physically been hurt if she had been driving and had that panic attack),  and the PTSD - her brother is nuts to think that OP should \"give this witch a chance\".\n\nNTA, and I agree 200% NC", "So the brother claims the bully has changed, but has the bully ever tried to contact OP to apologize? If the brother really thought the bully had changed he would have told OP sooner. Instead he intentionally set up OP to be surprised and thankfully OP was able to walk out and tell her other brother. \n\nGoing NC with that despicable brother is fully justified. For those in family contacting her ask if family is so important then why did your brother date someone that bullied his sister so badly in HS? Why is an unrepentant bully more important to brother than his own sister, who he knows suffered a great deal due to her actions?", "NTA.  Sounds like you have no choice but to cut him from your life.  As someone else suggested send him a letter detailing everything that was done to you and what you continue to go through, stating you cannot be around someone who triggers panic attacks everytime you see them and flashbacks to the abuse.  And if she had changed she wouldn't have let him blindside you.   Your brother knew he was in the wrong which is why he hid her from you for so long. I would find it very difficult to forgive him at this point.", "What's better for a school bully than to become a family bully. Instead of 2 other girls, she has the brother. God forbid Amy is still buddies with the other 2 on top of marrying the brother...", "NTA", "Your Brother is entitled to marry whoever he wants.  (Even if he has incredibly bad judgment).\n\nAnd by the same token you are allowed to not interact with anyone you don't want to,  don't feel you can trust, who've hurt or traumatized you or you just plain don't want to.  \n\nBe prepared, if your parents take his side you'll be under alot of pressure to cave & accept her as \"family\".   Please make an appointment with your therapist as soon a you can.  \n\nNTA", "NTA.", "Nta", "NTA. Why would people who did not go through what you did, tell you how to feel ?", "Don\u2019t be too angry if the other brother can\u2019t keep the promise but you are NTA", "I bet you were a bully weren't you? And I'm sure nothing has changed with u has it u prob still bully don't you ?", "She was physically assaulted by her for the entirety of 5 whole years causing her to have PTSD. Why should she stay in contact with her abuser's husband? To be reminded that her own flesh and blood chose her abuser over her?", ">  Even if she regrets what she did, \n\nWhich, judging from what's in the post, Amy hasn't indicated she does. All OP has is brother's insistence that she has changed. Not even an apology from Amy.\n\nUnfortunately - and speaking as somebody who went through bullying at school myself - sorry doesn't undo the damage, but it would definitely be a start. This quite clearly isn't even that.\n\nThe brother is, quite frankly, disgusting for hiding this for so long, and that he has done so means he *knew* the reaction he would get."]}
