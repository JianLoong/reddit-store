My (26F) parents split up about ten years ago, my mother is still single and my dad remarried and had my sister (8) with my stepmother. The age gap makes things a little hard, but I try to keep a good relationship with my sister, and for the most part she likes me and enjoys spending time with me.\n\nNow since I was in high school, I've preferred to dress more conservatively/traditionally. I prefer dresses and skirts to pants, and long sleeves to short. This is just my personal preferance, not how I think every woman should dress. My sister has noticed, and asked why I dress like that, and I just tell her it's how I like to dress.\n\nThe issue is my stepmother thinks this makes me a bad influence. She thinks that by dressing this way, I'm going to make my sister think she has to as well, and that I'm enforcing traditional gender roles. It doesn't help that I think my sister is starting to copy me, and has been wanting to wear more dresses and such.\n\nSo the last time I visited, she asked me for a favor. She asked if I could change into something less \"old timey\" whenever I come to see them. She meant just like jeans or regular pants, not as in like half naked if that's what you're thinking. I told her that wasn't happening, and that I have every right to dress the way I do.\n\nWell that blew up in my face, because the day after my dad called. He said that he and my stepmom were \"concerned about the influence you're having on your sister\" and would like me to keep my distance. Basically now I'll only get to see her on her birthday and holiday's so not until thanksgiving.

Be honest with her, and let her experience their crazy for herself, she will hopefully figure it out eventually.  \n\nAlso, I strongly suspect this isn't the only reason they don't want you around her - to crazy/evil stepmother, your existence is a constant reminder of the life Daddy had before and she probably doesn't want you around in general, this may be just an insane excuse.", "NTA\n\nIt baffles me that she would want you to lower your standards because she's afraid of her daughter looking up to you. \n\nShe sounds like a pretty toxic person if she trying to keep your stepsister from you because you chose to cover yourself.", "NTA. Your clothes, your choice - it's that simple. I wouldn't call what you wear conservative, I'll call it comfortable. You should dress in clothes that make you feel comfortable, and what that means depends on you. \n\nI am sorry your dad and stepmom have been trying to cut you off from your sister.

You dress however you want, how is that hard for people to understand?? This is where people get so weird about the gender stuff, and forget that people are individuals who like to dress differently. How is it a bad influence if you wear what you like around her? If anything, that is a good influence by showing her that you don't have to listen to what others say and dress how you want. So what happens when she grows up to be a teenager and wears more skimpy outfits, will they get mad at her for not dressing right?

They should be letting your sister know that she gets to choose how she dresses, and that it should make her comfortable not everyone else. She shouldn't wear skirts because that's what society says is traditional women's clothing, but neither should she wear trousers because \"that's what real feminists wear\", she should wear what she feels comfortable in no matter what ANYONE else thinks (including you, your dad and your step-mum)... the small exception to this being the law (but even then you can fight to change that too, because female nipples aren't anything shameful)", "NTA\nYour sister isnt being influenced by you just because she wants to copy you. She is 8, she is just looking up to her older sister. She literally asked and all you said is that was how YOU personally liked to dress. You didnt say any bullshit about it being how women should dress. Your sister has to learn how she likes to  dress and this opened her eyes to an alternate style that she may or may not want to stick with.

Part of the push against gender stereotyping is removing the expectation of people wearing certain things because people tell them to. By making your own choices and spreading the message that choosing what you want is absolutely ok, you're fighting against the thought police. Your step mum ironically is trying to be what she says she doesn't want and is removing choice.
