My son plays baseball and watches all sports, including the NFL. His girlfriend is into Taylor Swift. Autumn and her boyfriend want to go as Marie and Pierre Curie.\r  \n\r  \nThe issue has been Autumn and her boyfriend saying mean things to Thatcher and his girlfriend about their costume. The biggest issue is that they said that his girlfriend shouldn\u2019t be Taylor Swift because his girlfriend is Black. We are white and live in a very white area, she\u2019s one of the few Black kids in the district. Thatcher got into a massive argument with Autumn over this. We weren\u2019t home when this happened but when Thatcher told us what happened, we spoke to both of them.\r  \n\r  \nThatcher was justifiably really angry, he said that it didn\u2019t matter because anyone can be Taylor Swift for Halloween. Thatcher tries to learn about his girlfriend\u2019s struggles and culture. \r  \n\r  \nWe talked to Autumn about this and she at first dismissed it. We pushed her and she wouldn\u2019t apologize until we had to threaten to take away her electronics.\r  \n\r  \nA few days later, she made a comment about how \u201cdumb\u201d the costume was and how they\u2019re only going as it because they\u2019re famous and how my son is just \u201cfollowing trends\u201d. Autumn was talked to again and she apologized.\r  \n\r  \nThe last straw was yesterday, I had gotten a call from Autumn\u2019s science teacher that her and her boyfriend were complaining about Thatcher\u2019s costume and had made other kids uncomfortable, I apologized and she said that Autumn and her boyfriend had said racist things before and I asked why she didn\u2019t tell me. She told me she emailed me. After talking for a bit, we realized the email in the schools system was wrong and I gave her my correct email and she said she\u2019d help me get it changed in the system.\r  \n\r  \nI talked to Autumn and she said that her and her boyfriend just \u201ctell the truth in class\u201d, she also admitted she wasn\u2019t sorry for what she said to Thatcher.\r  \n\r  \nI told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to go to the Halloween party and she told me I was overreacting. I asked some of my friends for advice and they said I was being too hard on her. My son, however, is really upset and says that knowing she\u2019s getting grounded for her behavior makes him more comfortable bringing his girlfriend over. He says he wouldn\u2019t want to live with us if we didn\u2019t punish her racism.

Your daughter is displaying concerning behavior, and evidently has a history of doing so. You need to work on getting through to her so she doesn\u2019t carry that behavior into her adult life. I\u2019d also recommend some therapy- someone to really dig in to find out why your kid thinks it\u2019s okay to say these things, and help them understand how hurtful and wrong it can be. She may not be willing to open up to you, so a third party could be helpful. \n\nAs a parent you have a duty to raise a respectful, thoughtful, kind child. That means you need to take steps to understand why she is behaving as she is and change her mindset. If keeping her from going to her own Halloween event will accomplish that, then go for it.", "NTA\n\nIf Autumn is making racist comments in school and the teacher has noticed and reported it to you, you have to take a stand and make her realize this is unacceptable behavior.\n\nIt seems harsh but grounding her from the party may be what it takes to make her realize the seriousness of her unacceptable behavior.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA Your friends are wrong. Your daughter is racist. You need to figure out the source of her racist behavior.", "Not allowing her to go to the party is a good start. But I would seriously figure out why she\u2019s saying all these racist things, could she be learning all this from this boyfriend of hers??", "NTA. She is all of 15 years old. I knew better at eight.\n\nThe question is where she has learned this racism because these opinions do not form in a vacuum.", "NTA\n\nUnrepentant 15 year old racist? Missing the party should be the least of her worries. Everything of hers needs to be re-examined, online usage, bf...\n\nYour son's gf is not safe in your home from your daughter, let that sink in.", "Dude your daughter and her BF are racist. Her Halloween party when she is 15 does not matter right now.", "NTA.  Your daughter is racist. This needs to be addressed.", "NTA. Have you met the boyfriend's parents? If not, maybe you should. Maybe your daughter is getting all of this from his family? And if that's the case, you may want to consider how much interaction she has with her boyfriend and his family.", "NTA, it's our job to raise our kids to not be racist shits. I would also be very concerned that a 15 year old and *hopefully* similar aged boyfriend think it's acceptable to act like this. There's something deeper here and honestly it sounds like neither of them are good for the other if they're feeding off of each other's racism.", "Absolutely the fuck not. NTA and whoever these \"friends\" are that you asked for advice from and said you're being too hard on your daughter about being literally **racist** are not friends. They're closet racists themselves. Dump them. Immediately. Because that's probably where autumn learned this behavior from. Absolutely not.", "NTA, your friends are idiots. You have to make a hard stand against racism, every time period.", "NTA. Your daughter needs to learn there are consequences for her words and actions. I\u2019m glad her teacher reached out. Also Thatcher sounds like a sweet kid, the costume idea with his gf I am sure will be really popular! I would definitely recommend having your daughter in some kind of therapy, since the fact she (likely) ignored/didn\u2019t care about hurting other students means in private with her bf and potentially other friends these are things she says, and possibly worse.", "It hard to exercise tough love but I think this situation calls for it. It\u2019s not dumb for a black girl to want to dress up as Taylor Swift, and people will know who she is, because Taylor swift is more than \u201cwhite\u201d just like if a kid dressed as snoop dogg without going blackface. NTA, just being a good parent and teaching their child that racism is unacceptable and will have consequences. Why is Autumn so concerned with what someone else goes for Halloween as?", "NTA. Your daughter is making somebody uncomfortable due to race; some action is in order. Nobody can say for certain what the best way of dealing with this might be, but clearly you needed to do something. \n\nA long discussion with your daughter is in order- given that your son is dating somebody of a different race and that you are not tolerating your daughter's behavior, I think we can safely surmise you are not encouraging racism in your household, so you need to get to the heart of the matter and her behavior. I'd guess part of the issue is the strong trend against cultural appropriation- your daughter has probably misinterpreted this trend to be that kids can only dress up as people they share a racial background with. This is understandable, as even adults have trouble with the nuances of what's offensive and what's OK. Have a talk with her free of judgement and see if you can help her work through what is bothering her and more appropriate ways to address it.", "NTA.\n\nYou're doing amazing as a parent for trying to get your daughter to realize that racism is wrong. It's not just Thatcher's gf, it's the kids at school too, and who knows who else she's said these things too.", "NTA.\n\nRacism shouldn't go unpunished, period, doubly so since she's attacking her brother. She's the perfect age to learn actions have consequences.", "NTA. I\u2019m not gonna say the obvious \u201cthey learned it from you\u201d comment because kids can pick up things from everywhere not just their parents, however if you want them to stop you will have to commit to that. Speak up more against racism, tell her racism isn\u2019t speaking the truth, that it\u2019s insidious, maybe force her to learn about it more if you can. Why these comments aren\u2019t dumb jokes.", "NTA - this is a much bigger issue than just the Halloween costume, especially given that at least one teacher you know of attempted to contact you. I\u2019d speak with the school directly to see who/if anyone else has also attempted to contact you so you aren\u2019t seen as accepting/ignoring the behavior. There needs to be a bigger dive in to how/where she learned this behavior and how you\u2019re going to work to adjust her viewpoint. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s important to recognize where you\u2019re abilities to manage this end and where you need someone else to step in as well. Be aware of who you ask as they should be qualified to handle the situation and you would be putting emotional labor on them.", "NTA. I\u2019d make her stay home and watch a documentary on the struggles black people have went through or racism.", "NTA. You gotta stand up for what is right.", "NTA.", "Punish the damn racism, hell no no fucking party, get caught up on what the helll she been sayin IN SCHOOL that you dont even know of, and be assertive for the stuff she does at home.\n\nRacism is not ok, and if she wasnt like this before consider external influences... and therapy and qhatnot (including consequences!) May help her be notracist and a dick. But if shes always been like it... i would look at where it became/from acceptable pote tially in everyones lives.\n\nThe parents who say its no big deal are also excusing racism. So id honestly not expect support from them ever tbh...\n\n My \"truth\" for the kid is this \"you are a racist, and it is disgusting. Truth is an embarassing excuse you try to use, do better be better.\"", "NTA but if you limit your response to punishing her, she'll just be resentful and her racist attitudes and behaviour will continue. She'll probably even blame her brother and his gf for her punishment.\n\nUnfortunately I have no practical advice on the best way to address this =( good luck.", "NTA, but YWBTA if you listened to your friends and let this slide. Have your friends ever faced racism/discrimination growing up? Are their kids vulnerable to isolation in the same way a young black girl would in a predominantly white school district?", "Too hard on her? Her ass would be grounded until I was not embarrassed that I raised a racist. NTA, but you are if you let this go.", "NTA. Why in the world is your daughter so caught up in this that she has to complain at home and at school about someone else\u2019s costume? Like why is this so important to her? Very concerning.", "I\u2019ll be your new friend:\n\nThe punishment is NOT too harsh. Missing one party for being racist to your son\u2019s girlfriend? Missing one party for being racist at school and making other students uncomfortable so her teacher has to email you? All while she STILL doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s doing anything wrong? She\u2019s getting off very easy. NTA.", "NTA. Tell your daughter she can't dress up as Marie Curie because she's not Polish. See how stupid that sounds? Halloween is literally the time to dress up as fantastical as you want. Race should never limit that.\n\nSnip this shit in the bud with your daughter and put up huge consequences if she doesn't understand where she's going wrong.", "NTA Anti-racism equals action. Take everything out of Autumn\u2019s room. Enroll her in anti-racism classes:    \n\nhttps://www.cultureally.com/blog/antiracismtrainingandresourcestocheckout?format=amp\n\nTell her her words and actions will not be tolerated in your house and set up a schedule of how many hours she needs to spend on the courses to earn each item back. That should also include her \u201cfun\u201d activities.", "Oh my god, NTA, OP. I just need to input one quote however: If there's a Nazi at the table and 10 other people are talking to them, there's 11 Nazis at the table.", "NTA. \n\nIf this were me, I would require my child to break up with their boyfriends and be refusing to let them see each other. This is a disgusting thing your daughter has said and she needs therapy and education and grounding. She wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere", "NTA You NEED to Punish her Racism! Take away her electronics and don't let her go to the party. You might want to talk to his parents about the kids' racist behaviors. If it's coming from them, then you need to step in and put your foot to his ass", "NTA; she's making racist comments, imo you could be harsher with her punishment and still be fine.\n\nRacism isn't okay, and if she's not learning it from you I can only imagine where she is learning it from. You need to figure that out and cut off their contact.", "NTA. You've tried talking to her, and the school has tried talking to her. Next you have to step it up from talking. What punishment would be real if it included going to a party?", "NTA honestly, I kind of think you're underreacting (lol). I would be devastated to discover my daughter is a racist. Ugh.", "Nope, not hard enough. If she's turned into an unapologetic, unrepentant racist; she needs to be very firmly and harshly shown that it is not acceptable.", "NTA OP, but your daughter sure is.  \u201cJust telling the truth\u201d is a classic AH defense right up there with \u201cI was only joking\u201d.", "It's Halloween, Thatcher can dress up however she wants to whether she's black, white, or pink...  Your daughter seems to be picking up some racism from somewhere, no clue where but you need to deal with it right now or it's only going to get worse.  I think banning her from going to a party is a good start, NTA.", "You named your son Thatcher?  Why?!", "People should be allowed to dress up as whoever they want for Halloween, not just who their race corresponds with. Where do you even draw the line with that kind of stuff? Does your daughter look similar enough to Marie Curie to dress up as her? Does she complain about people who dress up as dogs because they aren\u2019t real dogs? What if you\u2019re a really obscure race like a halfsie, are you only allowed to dress up as other biracial people then? What if a brunette wanted to be Taylor Swift? Or what if a guy wanted to be Taylor Swift? In the same way my dad was originally miffed that the actors in Hamilton weren\u2019t all white, I\u2019ll bet your daughter is using some bullshit logic to justify the discomfort she feels around other races (in other words, trying to apply logic to her own racism). \n\nPunishing her really isn\u2019t enough to change her mind towards her views, which is really the root of the problem. You need to have multiple long conversations about the issue with each other, patiently explaining your viewpoints. One of the most difficult things about teenagers is how stubborn they are, and trying to change their minds about things they think they know everything about. It\u2019s the right age to start discussing more in-depth ethical topics with one another. Just like how adults discuss politics and religion, teenagers are old enough to start dipping into those more controversial areas as well", "NTA, it started at home and there was no punishments just discussion about it being wrong. Then it continues at school and you have been contacted by the teacher, at this point a punishment NEEDS to happen! What your daughter is doing is wrong, and she needs to learn from consequences while she is still young and hopefully can learn from it before she gets older and set in her ways.", "NTA shout out to your son for sticking up for his gf", "NTA if she doesn't experience consequences now, it'll only get worse.....but next time it'll be a stranger recording her racist rant in public, posting it on the internet, and her getting fired from her career and publicly shamed. Seriously. \n\nHer making fun of the costumes for being trendy or lame is classic older sibling behaviour, so whatever. \n\nBut if it's all rooted in racism, this is your chance to set the tone for how completely unacceptable that is.\n\nHave you considered that your friends saying you're being too harsh might also be racist?", "NTA she is behaving like a racist and personally I would take more than a party away. Plus she\u2019d be doing some serious reading and writing on the subject. Bravo to your son for speaking up.", "NTA. Not only did she not apologize for the comment she had doubled down on it. She was talking about it so much it upset someone at school. Meaning she's learned nothing about kindness or respect here. Good for you for trying to nip it in the bud now you have to follow through.", "If you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll end up raising a racist and unleashing her upon the world. You need to find a way to stop that.", "Nta. Your daughter is ta she owes everyone an apology Frankly I'm surprised she wasn't expelled.", "NTA, my kid wouldn\u2019t be allowed to leave the house if i had caught them saying something like that once. Both of my boys are in relationships with WOC. Also, kids pick up what they are taught. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s your household, it sounds like her bf\u2019s, so I would also nip that relationship in the bud.", "NTA.\n\nNobody wants a racist around. You're doing everyone else at the party a huge favor. \n\nIt's disappointing that the school didn't give her some kind of punishment for her in school behavior.", "NTA it's a good start. But further education will be needed", "I think this could be a teachable moment for your daughter and her boyfriend.  What are they saying that they think is true?  Ask them to defend their position with facts, not some vague ' I feel it, so it must be true' teenage bullshit.  In a few short years, they could be working or going to school with a much more diverse group of people where they will either get kicked out, fired, or have their asses handed to them.\n\nI'm not sure grounding her is the answer, but you are NTA for addressing this issue with them.", "NTA. You obviously know her behaviour is unacceptable. You can't necessarily punish her out of thinking shitty racist thoughts, but you can ABSOLUTELY show her that words and behaviour have consequences. Were any of your friends who told you you were being too hard on her Black? I'm guessing not. You're doing the right thing attempting to stamp out this behaviour. Be strong mama. Zero tolerance for racism is the only way.", "NTA in this particular situation. But bro you really gotta teach that young lady how to behave. And what\u2019s with that having bf/gf at 15/13?? Am I already too old to understand that?", "NTA \n\nHonestly I'd ban the boyfriend altogether", "FAKE.", "Sounds to me like Autumn and her boyfriend are on the path to White Nationalism. Have a serious conversation with both of them. Ask them if they hang out with others that feel the same way and get them to explain their beliefs. See about getting Autumn into therapy.", "Yeah I don\u2019t care about the conflict. Wtf is a Marie and Pierre Curie costume?

They're saying you're being too hard on your daughter who is repeatedly taking crap about your son's girlfriend and being racist. Oh no, she can't go to a party. Big deal. Her saying racist things deserve a bigger punishment. If she doesn't copy that out she's going to find out that in the real world people aren't as forgiving.", "Based upon the way you have raised Thatcher, I suspect that the problem is Autumn's boyfriend. \nI  doubt that you raised her to be that way. \n\nI suggest that you and your husband speak with your daughter AND her boyfriend together.  Let her know that she will not be allowed to see him after school,  or on the weekends if this happens again. \n\nShe will see what is happening,  and probably let him go if he tries to get her to play these childish, racist games again.", "Check racism as soon as possible.

Such way of forcing good behaviour, imo, is acceptable only for adults who violate legal laws so we judge them and force them that way. But your daughter is just a teen.

My son plays baseball and watches all sports, including the NFL. His girlfriend is into Taylor Swift. Autumn and her boyfriend want to go as Marie and Pierre Curie.\r  \n\r  \nThe issue has been Autumn and her boyfriend saying mean things to Thatcher and his girlfriend about their costume. The biggest issue is that they said that his girlfriend shouldn\u2019t be Taylor Swift because his girlfriend is Black. We are white and live in a very white area, she\u2019s one of the few Black kids in the district. Thatcher got into a massive argument with Autumn over this. We weren\u2019t home when this happened but when Thatcher told us what happened, we spoke to both of them.\r  \n\r  \nThatcher was justifiably really angry, he said that it didn\u2019t matter because anyone can be Taylor Swift for Halloween. Thatcher tries to learn about his girlfriend\u2019s struggles and culture. \r  \n\r  \nWe talked to Autumn about this and she at first dismissed it. We pushed her and she wouldn\u2019t apologize until we had to threaten to take away her electronics.\r  \n\r  \nA few days later, she made a comment about how \u201cdumb\u201d the costume was and how they\u2019re only going as it because they\u2019re famous and how my son is just \u201cfollowing trends\u201d. Autumn was talked to again and she apologized.\r  \n\r  \nThe last straw was yesterday, I had gotten a call from Autumn\u2019s science teacher that her and her boyfriend were complaining about Thatcher\u2019s costume and had made other kids uncomfortable, I apologized and she said that Autumn and her boyfriend had said racist things before and I asked why she didn\u2019t tell me. She told me she emailed me. After talking for a bit, we realized the email in the schools system was wrong and I gave her my correct email and she said she\u2019d help me get it changed in the system.\r  \n\r  \nI talked to Autumn and she said that her and her boyfriend just \u201ctell the truth in class\u201d, she also admitted she wasn\u2019t sorry for what she said to Thatcher.\r  \n\r  \nI told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to go to the Halloween party and she told me I was overreacting. I asked some of my friends for advice and they said I was being too hard on her. My son, however, is really upset and says that knowing she\u2019s getting grounded for her behavior makes him more comfortable bringing his girlfriend over. He says he wouldn\u2019t want to live with us if we didn\u2019t punish her racism. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You need to really guilt it into her so she feels awful about what she did.", "NTA and she should be assigned to do a book report on the book of your choosing that would help teach her the consequences of racism.", "NTA. This punishment isn't going to fix the problem though. Your daughter is a racist. If this hate isn't coming from inside the home, you need to find out where it's coming from. Online influences, the boyfriend, or somewhere else. I would also recommend cutting her internet access for the time being. There's a lot of racist rhetoric online that she could be involved in.", "NTA but your daughter and bf are. It doesn\u2019t matter that they are still only kids, racism is a learned behavior. Her lack of authentic apology and continued defense calling it \u2018the truth\u2019 goes to show she doesn\u2019t plan on changing either.\n\nI would say missing the party is the first part of the punishment because there should be more done about unlearning the racism or rather, learn how to be kind and about the struggles of different people. So maybe volunteering at a women\u2019s shelter or soup kitchen, along with some required reading and therapy?", "Don't doubt yourself. Ur the adult, and your daughter is in the wrong. No party for you, girl.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter and her boyfriend are racist and I suspect the friends giving you advice are, too.", "NTA. This is the way. She chose to behave in a way that proves she cannot be trusted to behave politely unless she is being directly watched by her parents. So being directly watched by her parents is what's going to need to happen here. Play stupid racist games, win stupid racist prizes \ud83e\udd37\nThings don't get better until white parents do better.", "I would ask the teacher to forward you all of the emails that were previously sent. I would also reach out to her other teachers and the guidance counselor to see if they have noticed any concerns. Could she be learning it from the boyfriend or other friends? Do you have her social media passwords? Could she be posting messages that she has blocked you from?\n\nNTA- if you don\u2019t punish her, you are silently condoning and accepting her behavior to both her and your son. You do, however, need to come up with a long term plan to deal with her racism and educate her", "NTA. I don\u2019t have any teenagers but I don\u2019t see how stopping a kid from going to a party fixes racist behaviour. I feel like the punishment should fit the crime. Is there a volunteering opportunity instead? Maybe a couple documentaries to make her watch showing other people\u2019s struggles or something? \n\nI dunno, I guess I just don\u2019t see missing one party fixing the initial behaviour. She might just in her head twist it around to make herself the victim.\n\nI mean by all means yes, take away the party.  But just\u2026. Also do something else.", "NTA- I'm sorry, but your daughter being a proud racist is a bridge too far. Way too far. My kid would be in so much trouble, soooo much, and I'd be deeply ashamed, too. Like holy shit, that's a huge, huge problem. And she seems totally unrepentant. If it was JUST the Taylor Swift comments I might be able to believe she's just a tad stubborn and really closed minded and naive, but her teacher telling you she's been actively making racist comments at school seals it for me. Your daughter needs help and intervention, and a firm punishment. Racism must not be tolerated whatsoever. Makes me wonder where she's picking this crap up if not from you?

I think stopping her from going to the party is not harsh enough. NTA", "NTA your daughter is being racist. That's not a good look. Honestly, this may not be a severe enough consequence.", "NTA \n\nBut I would still take away the electronics. She might be educating herself through someone online presence that is racist.", "NTA, beyond NTA. Your daughter has some serious issues. Clearly, they are not coming from your house. Is she getting them from the bf? Do not let her go. Don't lessen her punishment in any way. Increase it if she doesn't stop. \n\nWhat others have suggested about showing her the consequences of her words as an adult (loosing jobs, places to live, being banned from establishments, loosing friends or anyone wanting to be around her socially at all etc) is a good idea. If there is a way to show her what it feels like to be on the reviewing end of those comments, do it. Idk if this would be wrong or not, but maybe your son can talk to his gf, and she will have some ideas to be able to show your daughter the error or her ways. \n\nPlease make sure your son feels comfortable bringing his gf over, as well as making sure she feels and knows she's in a safe space. Your son sounds like he is a wonderful, compassionate, and caring kid.  \n\nAs for your \"friends,\" ask them why they think you're Iverson reacting. If they respond with something like it's not that big a deal, she's a kid it's just words, press them to find out why they think that kind of behavior and mentality is acceptable. Is anyone Jewish? Is there any way to ask them a \"what if this was being said\" instead of what she's saying? Would you still think the same?\" Question. Those adults sound like they also need a lesson in \"racism is not acceptable, period.\" If it was me, I would make them squirm and be uncomfortable. I would continue to push until they either reali,ed they were wrong, or got defensive. If they got defensive, I would push more and ask them why they are defensive. Do they agree with your daughter?\n\nAs far as going forward with your daughter, make sure she understands there is 0 tolerance for this behavior. She will be in trouble, grounded, things and privileges taken away until she can understand why she is wrong. I would contact her other teachers to see if any of them have experienced the same behavior (and maybe even tried to contact you). Maybe you need to talk to the office and get her and her boyfriend into separate classes. Although, be careful with that. If he is the one influencing her, pushing her away from him bc you said so is only going to push her closer to him. Anyways, consequences will continue to happen until she is able to prove that she has seen why she is wrong. This doesn't mean that she apologizes because she wants her stuff back. That's an empty and meaningless apology. I'm trying to think of a way to help her understand why her words are not appropriate anywhere on any level. I am struggling to come up with ideas.\n\nI wonder, though, if her having to write something like a research paper would help. 5 pages (at least), double spaced with citations, and a bibliography. She will have to do research (which you're able to check because of the bibliography), and she would have to confront and see her words in writing, which can have a bigger impact. The other benefit of it would be helping her learn how to do a proper research paper. I know this is an out of the box idea. Idk if it will work, or it's even a good enough one to try. Or maybe a book report on \"Black Like Me\" would be beneficial? Reading that book definitely couldn't hurt. \n\nDon't feel bad. It sounds like you're doing the best you can as a parent. Unfortunately, you could be the absolute best parent to ever exist, instill open and loving beliefs into your children, and still end up in a situation like this. She is her own individual thinking being. Again, I'm thinking it may be coming from the bf since he seems to be a part of it every time she says something derogatory. The best thing you can do for that, though, is to teach her how and why she is wrong. So that she makes her own decision to get away from him (if he is the influence for this shit) because you know forcing it will do the exact opposite. \n\nEventually, she needs to give an honest and heartfelt apology to her brother, at least, if not his gf, too. That first apology wasn't because she was sorry for what she was saying. It was because she got in trouble and didn't want her stuff taken away. Don't give her a choice about that anymore. Take it away. Make sure she is still able to do the homework she needs to do, but that can be monitored to make sure she's doing only what she is allowed. Get her the old people's phone that only calls and texts, no apps, no internet, no anything, just bare basics. That way, she doesn't have her phone, but she is still able to get in touch with you and vice versa if it's needed. \n\nThis will take some time to figure out. I'm sure it's not going to be easy. I think you got this, though. You're on the right track. Don't hesitate to do Google (or whatever searchnengone you use) searches to see what ideas are out there to correct this behavior and mentality. That may be helpful as it is hard to teach this lesson when you don't have 1st hand experience with it. \n\nPlease provide updates. The journey in this could be important for other people dealing with similar issues.", "NTA. Your daughter is a hateful racist. Losing that party should be the least of her punishment. You need to find out where she\u2019s learning this awful behavior, why she thinks it\u2019s ok and FIX IT. \n\nThis will be something, that if not dealt with, will cause you to lose one of your kids.

It\u2019s clear from your response, and your son\u2019s clear position on racism, that you aren\u2019t the place she\u2019s learning this. Identifying the source and removing her from these influences (the boyfriend for starters) is a good place to begin.\n\nI\u2019d also be educating my child on the effects of racism, and how minorities are affected. She clearly needs to learn empathy. If she isn\u2019t responsive to this, I\u2019d be making a hasty b-line to therapy. Therapy is good anyways, but she may be in dire need of it. Good luck OP.", "Are you really asking if its wrong to punish your daughter for being racist? \n\nNot only does she need to be punsihed, she needs to stop seeing her boyfriend.

Surely that\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t know what it feels like to be knocked down a notch. She needs to know that this is bullying and that bullying is cowardly. It sucks being the only person of color in a school full of white kids. It\u2019s lonely. Don\u2019t let other parents who don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like play this down.

You say you live in a mostly white community. Are there any areas nearby where she can volunteer where she would be working alongside POC? NOT serving POC, no need to build on her prejudices. Or counseling perhaps. \nIs her boyfriend influencing her choices? If so, be on the lookout for other very ugly choices to start showing up.", "NTA\n\nLike the others said, this is alarming and your punishment is a responsible level of racism.\n\nThat said, I would 100% ask your friends why exactly their defending her racism by saying your going too hard on her... and maybe find new friends if this is how they react to this kind of thing.", "NTA! Something is definitely needed for Autumn, she is likely under the influence of her boyfriend (lets be real here 15, likely first love, new hormones, formative mental years for her). You can\u2019t exactly intervene and stop them from seeing each other, because then she becomes more rebellious and goes deeper in the wrong direction. The teacher mentioned these comments made other students uncomfortable, maybe if those are her friends they need to have a conversation with her. Without the boyfriend, the boyfriend should also be sat for a separate conversation. \n\n\nHer electronics also should be restricted to only for school, and she should be grounded for some time to reflect on her actions and who she is surrounded with. Her apologies are insincere, now I don\u2019t believe in spying on kids or anything like that. But I fully support parents having parental controls and restrictions set for their children\u2019s phones and electronic items with internet. Anyone under 18 doesn\u2019t need that much access to the internet, it\u2019s honestly out of control. I would suggest at the very minimum, restrict her phone to calculator and phone only (and apps for school) like an emergency only brick. If those are not set currently, I would suggest reviewing what she is posting online and setting that up. \n\n\nIt seems your household holds basic human standards as the expectation. Thatcher is proof of that trying to understand his girlfriend and her struggles at only 13. If Thatcher and Autumn were/are close, maybe a family discussion with you, your husband, Thatcher and Autumn could be a good thing. This way the significant others are not an influence in the conversation, maybe Autumn feels threatened by the girlfriend especially if they were close siblings (it feels like they are close, your family seems pretty chill). I think she has some jealousy of Thatcher\u2019s girlfriend and is expressing it in unhealthy ways, probably for attention, not that her boyfriend has probably been much help. \n\n\nAutumn needs to be aware now her racism is wrong. Firstly anything she posts online could possibly bite her in the butt for her future career. Secondly, her brother has a girlfriend who is probably now uncomfortable being around Autumn and likely knows her apologies are insincere. Thirdly, she may catch the wrong person on the right day, if she continues to speak like this publicly. That wont be pretty. \n\n\nActually, I would also suggest amongst the conversation showing her what can happen to people who are openly racist. Especially if she is still not sincere in trying to stop this behavior. Maybe not the physical altercation portions but there are some great videos that cover the stories, and the conclusion to them (job loss, jail time). Both of in person and online racism, she needs to know no matter who, what, when, where or why, racism is never the answer. Your actions and words, can and will have consequences.

Maybe find diverse programs?", "Teaching her to keep it covert is a start.  There is a saying, \"Hypocrisy is the tribute vice pays to virtue.\"  Obviously, more education is necessary here, but it's a good start to teach people they can't be blatantly nasty to other folks whether the nastiness is due to race, the feeling that one has more money, is smarter, more popular.  Basic civilized behavior is well worth teaching by itself.  \n\nObviously, it's not a bad idea to take the kid to a holocaust museum and show her what happens when people think they are too big for their britches and decide they are a \"master race.\" Teaching people about the potato famine where people were forced to pay rent to farm their own lands and starve in the midst of plenty, discussing colonialism and the like isn't a bad idea either.

Even if all black people were racist against whites in the US, it would not erode the current power balance, it would not result in the oppression of white people.in fact, it would probably shift more power to whites, who would seek to suppress that kind of sentiment.", "But that is not what the \"all people matter\"  trope was all about.", "You have a really twisted view of the world.

I said they were racist against whites and Asians, were looting and burning cities, and were destroying black neighborhoods. I said crime would skyrocket if they defunded police. \n\nI was right. BLM did not benefit black people. It destroyed black businesses and drove jobs from black neighborhoods. It promoted looting and shoplifting, a scourge which continues today. It caused stores yo close, prices to rise, and it\u2019s harder to find a grocery store or pharmacy in walking distance, thanks to BLM. BLM just reconfirmed it\u2019s support for Hamas, after the genocidal antisemitic terrorist GroupMe r@ped and murdered all the unarmed civilians it could catch.

Are you saying that people are wrong for disliking those who are politically different to them?", "Ok so?? The definition STILL includes systemic racism, which people have argued here it doesn't.
