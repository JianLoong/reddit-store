Of course l was concerned and told my daughter to stay in my room, I went into hers and low and behold they were screaming. But not from fighting. At this point I was irritated, if they want to do it every day thats their choice but if they're waking my children up at 2am I think I have the right to say something. \n\nThe next day I went over to their house and basically told the husband that \"if he's that h0rny he can get a motel or sh@g in the basement.\" \n\nHe got mad, and embarrassed.

The odd evening is understandable, but I don\u2019t think we can all expect to be able to make as much noise as we like without any consequences. I would feel exactly the same way if it were OP\u2019s kids banging drums during the night.

If this is extremely loud, performative sex, then yes, it is the couple\u2019s responsibility to adjust their sex schedule to avoid keeping their neighbours up throughout the night. If it\u2019s normal, reasonable sex noise and the wall is just paper thin, then there needs to be a bit of give and take from both sides to allow for a harmonious living situation. \n\nI honestly think this could have been avoided with a much more reasonable and sensitive approach when alerting the neighbours to the situation.

You both have to share thin walls. Personally I\u2019d rather live next to someone having loud sex (which doesn\u2019t last that long) versus 6 kids ages 2-16 sharing only two bedrooms. Do you really think the 2 year old is perfectly quiet/ that they don\u2019t have to hear all the noises the 7+ people living next door make? Are your kids all non-verbal? The thing about shared walls and homes in close proximity is that everyone has to put up with annoyances related to that.\n\nYou have thin walls. The solution is to sound proof on your end and work to be a good neighbor. It sounds like you started out by criticizing them and building animosity. Now you\u2019re upset they aren\u2019t respectful. What were you really thinking was going to happen when you started texting them and/or tried to dictate what they do on their own home? \n\nThis is one of those ones where if you\u2019d gone over when they first moved in with cookies, welcomed them to the neighborhood, shared that the walls were thin, apologized in advance for noises your kids make when they are there on Tuesdays and Thursdays, asked them to text you if noise got to be too much, and then also told them that sounds from their bedroom really carry too and asked them to be cognizant of that whenever possible, you\u2019d probably be in much better shape. Hell, you could have even offered to help them with some sound proofing measures. \n\nInstead, you decided to become their asshole neighbor (YTA) to the level where they now not only don\u2019t care, but actively dislike you. Hint: if you want someone to change their behavior to accommodate you, provoking them into disliking you is rarely the way to make it happen. It\u2019s laughable that you\u2019re complaining about them not respecting you, when you were anything but respectful towards them. This all could have been handled with respectful behavior on your end and you\u2019d probably be much closer to what you wanted than you\u2019re ever going to be now.\n\nThis is your lesson for next time you\u2019re dealing with neighbors: don\u2019t be an asshole to them and expect them to respect you for it. By the way, you wrote that you\u2019re \u201cnot one to be confrontational\u201d but your behavior actually reads like someone who seethes passive aggressively and then explodes. That\u2019s not how you should really handle anything. A kind assertiveness here at the start would likely have gone much better. Resenting something for months, texting instead of talking, and then imploding is not a good way to handle conflict.\n\nGet some wall hanging, white noise machines, ear plugs, and noise cancelling headphones for your kiddos. Google sound proofing or sound dampening options and consider doing some appropriate work to your home Or switch the rooms around.
