Our new neighbours moved in about 4 months ago and not to be TMI but I swear they're always doing something. I'm not one to be confrontational so I tried to just ignore it, I can sleep through the night fine. But a few days ayo my daughter (female 5) came into my room at 2am crying, saying she thinks the neighbours are fighting eachother and that they were screaming. Of course l was concerned and told my daughter to stay in my room, I went into hers and low and behold they were screaming. But not from fighting. At this point I was irritated, if they want to do it every day thats their choice but if they're waking my children up at 2am I think I have the right to say something. \n\nThe next day I went over to their house and basically told the husband that \"if he's that h0rny he can get a motel or sh@g in the basement.\" \n\nHe got mad, and embarrassed. He told me it was none of my business what they did in bed and then slammed the door in my face.\n\nI feel like I may have been in the wrong but they're also doing it, 6 feet away from 6 sleeping children with only a thin wall in between.\n\nAm I the a$$hole\n\n\u2757\u2757EDIT AS I EXPLAINED IT WRONG\u2757\u2757\n\nAlot of yoy are saying I ATA for the way I handled it, and from the way I wrote it I completely understand that. I didn't put in enough context. \n\nI share custody of my children and only have them on Tuesdays and Thursdays as their mother and stepfather are in work those days. I want to make it clear that I had mentioned this to them many times over text, id told them that they can do what they want but that on those two days id appreciate some quiet or for them to put on a TV show loud in the background so my kids wouldn't hear them specifically. They didn't respect those wishes and actually started doing it alot louder on those days and also put on very loud (yk what) videos on aswell. When I went to their house that was months into the situation and I had snapped, I have apologised to them for snapping but I still feel as if they aren't respecting me or my children at all.", "created_utc": 1688825711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u5e5z/aita_for_telling_my_neighbours_to_get_a_hotel_if/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am sure your neighbors hear you too. \n\nIn the meantime, invest in some noise machines to help mitigate the sounds. You can also look into sound proofing the rooms, they sell heavy curtains and things to help reduce sound", "YTA. \n\nThey got a room, and they pay for it, just like you do. They fill their house with noisy sex, and you filled yours with the result of noisy sex. \n\nI'd've slammed the door in your face, too.", "Yeah, YTA. I get it's annoying but you don't get to dictate what consenting adults do in their own home and you definitely don't tell them to go spend money on a motel/hotel/Holiday Inn instead of enjoying their own home.", "YTA they pay for their home. They are allowed to do whatever they want in their home. You have to be pretty entitled to think that you can dictate what people do in their own space.\n\nEdit-play white noise in your kids room if it\u2019s bothering them.", "YTA, you can't tell other people what to do in their homes. Maybe you should change rooms with your daughters.", "Yta they can bang if they want", "Yeah, YTA. Had you gone about confronting the couple in a different way, they probably would have received the information a little more openly (I assume this because you say he was embarrassed). \n\nSure it\u2019s annoying but it\u2019s their home and they have the right to \u201cdo stuff\u201d anytime they want, no matter where your kids happen to be. I\u2019d suggest apologizing for the way you approached them the first time and calmly explain that your young children are on the opposite of their bedroom wall and can hear screams (& \u201cother noises\u201d) and it worries them because they don\u2019t understand the type of screams those are. I\u2019d assume any respectable adult wouldn\u2019t intentionally traumatize a child with sex noises, but you never know. \n\nIf they choose to be kind neighbors or not isn\u2019t up to you though, you can only choose how you behave and you were wrong for the way you approached the situation.", "YTA for how this was handled. Everyone has the right to privacy and to do what they want in their own home. You could have politely informed them that their noise was keeping the family awake at night and ask if they could keep it down after quiet hours. (Most places have a quiet ordinance). It isn\u2019t realistic to not ever hear the neighbors when you have so many people living so close together, but any reasonable person isn\u2019t going to want to have families hearing them during sexy time.", "YTA  You don't get to dictate where, when and how your neighbors have sex in their own home.", "Yes, you are the AH. Only because you handled the situation so poorly. If you went over there in a kind way and just said \u201cfyi the walls are thin and my kids can hear you!\u201d The guy might still have been embarrassed, but you would have gotten your point across and you might have gotten the desired result. But since you were a prick about it, YTA", "YTA for the way you handled it.  When my brother and I were roommates, he had a girlfriend who was very vocal.  A few times I had friends over, it was kind of awkward.  I asked him if they could try to be quieter.  No issues after that.", "Because of the way you asked, YTA. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a married couple having sex in their own home, wherever and whenever they want. That was a ridiculous comment for you to make.\n\nIf you had gone there and explained the situation in a different way, focusing more on the noise factor, then I would have voted differently. \n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I'm not unsympathetic to your situation. I was in a similar one and I ended up just shouting through the wall for them to keep quiet. We never heard a peep from her again.", "You certainly can say whatever you want but you may want to think about what reaction you would like from your neighbors. Perhaps, having a calm adult conversation would get you at least an ounce of understanding & sympathy from your neighbors. \n\nVerbally attacking people probably not ever going to the results you want. \n\nSorry but YTA \u2014 maybe invest in a white noise machine for your kids room", "YTA. They are in their own house. \n\nYou also have children, how were they created might I ask?\n\nIf you were my neighbour I\u2019d do it all the more.", "YTA, politely asking them would have been more than enough. You certainly can't try to demand people dont do that in their own home.", "YTA. You need to provide better sleeping arrangements for your kids, not dictate your neighbours sex life in their own house. Insulate the walls or, better yet, find a place where 4 kids don't have to share one single bedroom.", "I read your edit and while it\u2019s almost E S H because of their immature response it\u2019s still YTA. I get not wanting your kids to hear and I don\u2019t blame you but you are approaching this wrong. It\u2019s not their responsibility to do quieter things or blast a loud television show to block the sounds they make. You take the onus here. Get a white noise machine, invest in headphones or ear plugs for the kids, even go to management if they\u2019re breaking a noise ordinance.", "YTA. It\u2019s not like they were aware that your daughters were sleeping on the other side of the wall and it wasn\u2019t like it was malicious. You can always be nice about it, and as someone who has 6 kids, I don\u2019t feel you\u2019re in the position to call someone out on being horny\u2026\u2026.", "Why is everything on them? Have you tried white noise machines for the kids? Fans? If you have the kids for a couple of weeks because of a break, are you planning on sending texts with an updated schedule so they can adjust their behavior? Is it nosiest in your daughters room? If so, can you trade bedrooms with them?\n\nYou have texted them multiple times about their sex life, days you\u2019d like them to do it another room, or adjust how they do it when you have your kids, suggesting that they turn the tv on loud or get a hotel room. What are you doing inside your home to try to make it better?\n\nYou live in a situation with shared walls and part of that is dealing with the noise that come with it.\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with this issue over the years, white noise machine, fans, ear plugs have helped. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You popped out 6 kids and stuffed them all into a tiny shared housing complex, and are now mad you can hear the neighbors. You handled it terribly. I suggest switching bedrooms with your daughters.", "Yta. Why don't you buy a detached house then and have no party walls? Your neighbours can do whatever they like in their house. You can ask them to stop, they can ignore you. Easy", "Seriously YTA. Fuck all the way off with that shit. My wife and I enjoy each other any time we please.", "Info: how did you father six children if you can't type out the word sex?", "YTA. A simple,\u201dlook you\u2019re being a bit noisy\u201d and \u201cwoke up my kids\u201d would have been fine.  They\u2019re a married couple, doing what comes naturally, in their own home.", "Yta they don't need a hotel they can do stuff in their own house", "YIKES big YTA", "Listen, if you have 6 kids and thin walls in what sounds like a duplex your neighbors probably put up with more noise then you do. Leave them alone.", "YTA- you don't get to make rules for strangers bed room behavior-tellinh your neighbors to get a hotel is incredibly entitled and inappropriate.", "YTA. Buy or rent a bigger place or install some soundproofing. If you talk to your neighbours, just bring up the noise and not judgements on their sex life. By the number of kids you have, shagging is something you also like to do. People in glass houses should not throw stones", "This sounds like one of those fathers that will never hear from any of his kids even a single time after they turn 18.", "YTA. It\u2019s their house and their bed. Swap rooms with your daughter or invest in a white noise machine idk, your suggestion is ridiculous. Especially since you have SIX children so I\u2019m gonna guess you \u201cdid stuff\u201d quite a lot of times and no one complained to you", "YTA, but even they are acting weirdly and I think this can be considered as public indecency and you can call the police on them maybe.", "Even with the edit, still, YTA. It\u2019s their house. \nAlso, YTA for putting 6 kids in 2 rooms, especially with the oldest being 16.", "YTA\n\nThey can do what they want in their house. \nPretty sure you must've been just as ''so horny'' as your neighbour's to have 6 gremlins.", "YTA why don\u2019t you switch rooms so the kids aren\u2019t sharing a wall with them if that\u2019s the problem?", "There's normally noise laws, and it seems like the neighbors are getting louder on purpose, just like if you have a super loud party passed a certain time, you can't blaire noises and purposely scream, to wake your neighbors kids.  You've tried talking to them about it, and it only got worse, I would check on the noise laws to see if calling the police would help.\n\nAlso I would be pissed if my neighbor put on corn and cracked it for my young child to hear, thats not appropriate or right in any way", "All these YT A crack me up. Yes these people are free to have sex in their home, no argument. What they are not allowed to do is be so loud it disturbs neighbors, especially after 10-11pm where many places have ordinances on noise.\n\nDo they rent or own? If renting start complaining to the landlord. Start calling the police and file a noise complaint.\n\nNTA", "ESH\n\nThe way you went about it wasn't the smoothest, yeah. Probably should've had a script or something.\n\nBut no. \"They paid for the house, they can be loud, it's just sex\". Just no, dudes.\nThe first few times I had sex, yeah it was loud. But then, hey! I live in an apartment with others who can hear, so guess what? We matured and lowered our voices out of common courtesy for our neighbors! \n\nIt's not \"stifling sex\" or being \"prudish\". Literally, you can have an amazing love life without breaking out a megaphone and yelling \"I am currently being railed, world!\"", "I've edited my post with more context, to anyone who wants it.", "Ehh, ESH. While they\u2019re kind of being assholes about it, and I totally get that your kids hearing your neighbors doing the devil\u2019s tango is not ideal, there\u2019s nothing you can really do to control it. If it really bothers you, maybe filing a noise complaint would be enough to embarrass them into stopping, but at the same time, that\u2019s kind of a dick move.\n\nPeople will be people, I suppose. Not much you can do about it.", "NTA. time for some malicious compliance with a loud ass boom box and the hub.", "NTA. If they are doing at 2 am and its disturbing you and your family and should call the police for noise !", "NTA because of your edit. Like they can bang but they should respect u have kids and actually be quiet about it. Maybe move house or smh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
