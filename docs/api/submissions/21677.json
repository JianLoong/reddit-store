Of course l was concerned and told my daughter to stay in my room, I went into hers and low and behold they were screaming. But not from fighting. At this point I was irritated, if they want to do it every day thats their choice but if they're waking my children up at 2am I think I have the right to say something. \n\nThe next day I went over to their house and basically told the husband that \"if he's that h0rny he can get a motel or sh@g in the basement.\" \n\nHe got mad, and embarrassed.

The odd evening is understandable, but I don\u2019t think we can all expect to be able to make as much noise as we like without any consequences. I would feel exactly the same way if it were OP\u2019s kids banging drums during the night.

If this is extremely loud, performative sex, then yes, it is the couple\u2019s responsibility to adjust their sex schedule to avoid keeping their neighbours up throughout the night. If it\u2019s normal, reasonable sex noise and the wall is just paper thin, then there needs to be a bit of give and take from both sides to allow for a harmonious living situation. \n\nI honestly think this could have been avoided with a much more reasonable and sensitive approach when alerting the neighbours to the situation.

You both have to share thin walls. Personally I\u2019d rather live next to someone having loud sex (which doesn\u2019t last that long) versus 6 kids ages 2-16 sharing only two bedrooms. Do you really think the 2 year old is perfectly quiet/ that they don\u2019t have to hear all the noises the 7+ people living next door make? Are your kids all non-verbal? The thing about shared walls and homes in close proximity is that everyone has to put up with annoyances related to that.\n\nYou have thin walls. The solution is to sound proof on your end and work to be a good neighbor. It sounds like you started out by criticizing them and building animosity. Now you\u2019re upset they aren\u2019t respectful. What were you really thinking was going to happen when you started texting them and/or tried to dictate what they do on their own home? \n\nThis is one of those ones where if you\u2019d gone over when they first moved in with cookies, welcomed them to the neighborhood, shared that the walls were thin, apologized in advance for noises your kids make when they are there on Tuesdays and Thursdays, asked them to text you if noise got to be too much, and then also told them that sounds from their bedroom really carry too and asked them to be cognizant of that whenever possible, you\u2019d probably be in much better shape. Hell, you could have even offered to help them with some sound proofing measures. \n\nInstead, you decided to become their asshole neighbor (YTA) to the level where they now not only don\u2019t care, but actively dislike you. Hint: if you want someone to change their behavior to accommodate you, provoking them into disliking you is rarely the way to make it happen. It\u2019s laughable that you\u2019re complaining about them not respecting you, when you were anything but respectful towards them. This all could have been handled with respectful behavior on your end and you\u2019d probably be much closer to what you wanted than you\u2019re ever going to be now.\n\nThis is your lesson for next time you\u2019re dealing with neighbors: don\u2019t be an asshole to them and expect them to respect you for it. By the way, you wrote that you\u2019re \u201cnot one to be confrontational\u201d but your behavior actually reads like someone who seethes passive aggressively and then explodes. That\u2019s not how you should really handle anything. A kind assertiveness here at the start would likely have gone much better. Resenting something for months, texting instead of talking, and then imploding is not a good way to handle conflict.\n\nGet some wall hanging, white noise machines, ear plugs, and noise cancelling headphones for your kiddos. Google sound proofing or sound dampening options and consider doing some appropriate work to your home Or switch the rooms around.

Depending on the local ordinances/laws, they may actually be in violation if they're unreasonably loud and constant. You could try talking things over more amicably with both of them, but given what you've said that's unlikely to work. In which case you may wish to take further steps which may, arguably, be AH moves. Being an ass isn't always unjustified, especially if it's seriously impacting your children, although it will probably irreperably damage any relationship you could have with your neighbors. Do check local laws/your contract before doing anything drastic or even threatening to, obviously, don't take it to the landlord if they're in compliance, you shouldn't threaten to call the police if there's no legal reason to, and don't record them from your child's room to show them how loud they are if that's illegal.\n\nIf, however, your children are particularily sensitive or the walls are thin, rather than them being genuinely unreasonably loud, it might be worth investing in a white noise machine or similar.

It doesn't matter if you're fucking like gorrillas or watching a movie on full volume, neither are cool to do at 2AM.", "Right and if I want, I can blast music at all hours of the night and do loud heavy house work at 5am.

So why is this any different . and i dont know what country they live in, but in the  country where i live we have a rule where after 9 pm there should be no noise.", "Yes exactly. \"My house my rules\" comes with a huge asterisk in any multifamily situation.", "OP says he only has the kids a couple of days a week.

Maybe he has quiet sex. How would you know?", "I mean pretty clearly not mad about just having sex.  It's being so damn loud they can hear them regularly.  A one off every now and then is not a big deal at all but hearing that most nights is definitely annoying as shit.  That said, OP could and should have handled it better.  It's hard to convince people of your point of view when you're being a dick.", "Yeah, agreed. You don't need to scream to have sex, and definitely not at 2am. You shouldn't have to be completely silent and with the setup as it is, it may not be reasonably avoidable for the kids to be hearing some things, but screaming is just unnecessary and inconsiderate.", "If I was OP, I would get my phone, open the video.recorder, do a walk through of the entire house ending with the kids' rooms and their nightly \"background noise\".

It simply means we don't want kids in any capacity for any number of reasons. Rather than going into having kids blindly, we've analyzed our situations and the world, so yes, there is some judgement against people with lots of kids when they clearly cannot afford it in some way or another. To make ends meet, OP sacrifices his kids' privacy. He has older kids in with a literal toddler. If it was anymore than just a couple days a week with him, they wouldn't \"love it\" the way he claims. He'd have the teenagers refusing to go over anymore because they don't have space of their own to be alone.\n\nIf OP had the means to afford all those kids and give them their own rooms when they're teenagers and did his job as a parent to make them into respectful people, fine, whatever.

Then, he very politely explains how right when he's trying to \"whisper sweet nothings\" in his gf's ear, they'll hear a loud laugh from our space. \n\nI felt terrible for being rude and moderated our volume, he put up soundproofing material with the landlord's okay, we all ended up being good friends.", "If a person is having loud sex despite being told children can hear them, that person is sick.", "I doubt the kids are being very loud at 2am.\n\nWhat if the neighbors were blasting music?

Would it be different if the neighbors were blasting music?  Or super loud bass drumming through the walls/floors?  OP handled it poorly but it's quite the entitled point of view you have there.  Next time anyone bothers you about something, just mind your own damn business lol", "I did.\n\nI was gutted when we moved house and I got a room of my own. \n\nI got used to it, and I learned to like it eventually, but I also loved sharing.", "My first thought was to blast \u201cBaby Shark\u201d on repeat just to kill the mood, but your noise option is more fun \ud83d\ude04", "Tell the guy that she seems to like it better a little to the left.", "Then you realize they aren't going to listen and stop communicating with them and move up the ladder.

I get people who pay for a room are allowed to use it however, but there's a point where you are being an obnoxious d-bag about when and how you use it. Given OP's edit, I don't think he is unreasonable in the slightest, and just approached it the wrong way.\n\nHonestly, sleep for children is super important for their development, and if they're waking up the neighbors at 2am, they are likely breaking sound ordinance laws. The added fact that they've gotten worse about it according to the edit makes me think it's time to call the police next time. If they wanna bone, they can do so quietly if it's that late. If they wanna bone *loudly* at 2am, then they can be shamed by the cops for being so damn loud.\n\nObviously NTA", "NTA. It's wild that so many people here think its okay to be as loud as you want at 2AM, especially within shared wall residences.

You can't tell people when or how they can have sex in their house. Get some of those soundproofing mats.

He had kids 6 feet away from them, and he only had them two days a week and has already asked politely and they are being louder on those days. Sure it\u2019s your own house etc but not everyone wants to hear you having sex.", "And playing porn really loudly when you know he has kids over is rlly creepy and weird", "But that has nothing to do with the issue at hand. Even if it was only the five-year-old living in that room, people shouldn't have to not be able to use a bedroom because neighbors are having such loud screaming sex that it wakes them up in the middle of the night.\n\nAs other commenters have asked, would you feel the same way if the neighbors were blasting music at 2am?

Some people are fucking weird.", "Wow that was really a low blow. We have no idea the situation or the fact that the country usually gives mom custody regardless of the facts so to jump in this dad for just trying to keep his children children is way out of line. As well as what's wrong with a parent trying to not have his children in his home being taught things that they are already being desensitized to in this world. My personal life in my home yes my business but if it spills into the houses next door I have them made it public nuisance. Common courtesy and decency is so not popular today yet we cancel people on a daily who have unpopular tweets or status's where do we draw the line at attacking on personal decisions?\nRidiculous to assume he isn't a good dad because he doesn't have custody", "NTA - asking them to have sex a little quiter is reasonable. Any kind of noise at 2am is annoying", "I'm sorry is everyone missing the point of them deliberately playing porn and being extra on the specific days the CHILDREN are there?

The campground wasn't that big, so most of the tents were pitched in groups very close together. \n\n\nThe play by play in question was along the lines of Meatloaf's, 'Paradise by the Dashboard Light' and was hilarious. The clincher was when they came out after, and 10 of us were there holding score cards. \ud83e\udd23", "Eh, maybe, maybe not. I grew up sharing a room with 4 of my sisters. My dad split custody with his twins so sometimes there were 3 of us, other times 5.
