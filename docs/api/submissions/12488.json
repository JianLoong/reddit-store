So, I do get that you would feel left out and lonely because you look in and see them all snuggly and you're sleeping alone.    \nI think instead of thinking of her as a hypocrite, why not just tell her in a gentle and loving way, how you feel.  Openly communicate and both of you lay it on the table what the issues are that are keeping you apart.  She may actually not like sleeping with you for just the reasons she told you or she may have some past trauma or issues, who knows.  Snoring is definitely a very common issue that causes couples to sleep alone.  So, maybe you can try to address that issue and see if there's anything you an do for that.

But he's also the one who sleeps with his husband.", "Yeah, I was trying to not go there yet even though that's where my mind went. I was sleeping at a boyfriend's place when he SA me in the night and then claimed he had that disorder where people try to act out their sexual fantasies when asleep. I am definitely not saying this is what OP is doing, but unfortunately with the lack of detail that's what I thought of. It could be something as benign as just brushing up against her when he rolls over, but I feel like it would be best if he explains what he meant.", "Well, she said you snore. I don\u2019t know how bad it is, and I bet you don\u2019t know, either. \n\nSnoring isn\u2019t just annoying, it\u2019s can be an actual, (fixable), health problem for you. Go talk to your doctor about it. If you stop making noise over there, it might go a long way in fixing this. \n\nThe touching issue- well, the dog might be different, it\u2019s probably smaller and she can push it away/reposition it easier.", "so basically u asked what the issue was and she told u and u immediately dismiss her as a liar.  that part might be the deal breaker for her", "But there\u2019s nothing to suggest she\u2019s lying\u2026 the dog is a comfortable sleeping companion, you\u2019re not. If it\u2019s not a dealbreaker, get over it and don\u2019t make her feel guilty about her prioritizing her ability to get a good night\u2019s sleep. YTA.", "My guy, a full sized human male takes up nowhere near the same amount of space as a small dog. I agree with the top comment of NAH but man think logistically about the size difference.", "Why are you stalking me?", "My great-grandparents were happily married for over sixty years. They slept in separate beds. My grandmother said he had a tendency to toss and kick in his sleep. Part of their happiness probably came from the fact that they did what worked best for their relationship instead of following artificial rules like \"If you're compatible, your sleeping styles will automatically mesh.\"", "Sad but true. That's how my relationship is. Sometimes people make noises and have other issues. It's normal", "I guess what she wants is all that matters huh. Better than me, because I'd nope all the way out of that relationship. She and the dog can have that apartment and all the peace they want by themselves.", "People who snore never want to admit it.\n\nOP, what is it going to take to get through to you? Someone taking an audio/video recording of you sleeping (and snoring)?", "Separate blankets are truly the way to go for sharing a bed", "OMG separate blankets has stopped so many cranky fights now lol.", "Thanks for your input. Just helped me realise it's not the snoring, I just hate my dad even after a decade.", "Our Miniature schnauzer is the complete opposite.\n\nThe fucker will stretch out in exactly the right angle AND THE RIGHT PLACE to take up the most amount of space on my bed.\n\nIt's a full sized bed and I have like 1/3 of the room of the bed becuese I don't like having to hook my legs around him!\n\nI still love the little shit though. :P", "I feel like most dogs i've owned get \"settled\" into bed.\n\nI say most becaus I did have one loud and running dreamer....woke up with bruises lol.", "Ain\u2019t that the truth. Nothing short of a major earthquake will make my cat get out of bed when he\u2019s good and comfy. (We also have a king bed, so there\u2019s me, my partner, and our cat hogs the middle.)", "Being a light sleeper with a snoring partner is a recipe for sleep deprivation and resentment. I recently got my own bed, and everything is better now. Life is better now!", "*as easily.", "Lol that's hilarious. We had new neighbors move in, and before I could go out to meet them their boxer dog just walked right into the house, looked around a bit, caused the kids no end of delight, and left. \n\nSo it was a nervous minute before I learned he was the friendliest and just wanted to be wherever people are \ud83d\ude05 but now boxers land pretty solidly in my top 10 for dogs", "She says the dog is soft and cuddly.", "And separate mattresses, because then my boyfriend can move around as he wishes, but I cannot feel it on my side. \n\nWhen we had one big matress, I could feel him moving throughout the night. And that annoying dip it had, where he laid. It felt like I keept rolling towards him even on my back", "Same actually! Though I\u2019m still having issues with my partner because I move around a lot/make noises due to chronic nightmares. Good news is that we just secured a two bedroom flat and we\u2019ll be sleeping separately there, so both of us should be able to rest better :)", "Yanno? Totally fair, haha. I also put in an edit about his communication vs the core issue, which are separate things.", "We have 1 cat. He manages to occupy an entire king bed in a way that neither of us can get more than a sliver to lie on. I don't even understand how that's possible, the guy lies the whole diagonal so that neither sides nor bottom can be used.", "You mean your cat has a king size bed that he graciously lets you sleep in with him :P. Once you onw a cat all your stuff belong to them, those are the rules", "Awwww! I can definitely understand your concern for your kids, and I'm glad it ended up being a good experience! \n\nI only had small dogs growing up, but my husband is a boxer fanatic so we got one. Now I never want any other breed, they are so friendly and derpy! I'm so happy to hear you like them so much!", "So you believe she is lying b/c you believe sleeping next to a small poodle is the same as sleeping next to a snoring adult male human who gives off heat, moves around and \"touches\" (this can mean anything from cuddling her - which can be uncomfortable for a lot of people when trying to sleep - to pushing into her to randomly groping her)\n\nYou think a poodle puppy moving in a bed makes as much impact as an adult male moving in a bed. You think her touching a puppy to a level she can control is the same as you touching her, which she can't control.\n\nYou think she is lying about your snoring? \n\nYou seem hell bent on taking her need for soynd rest as a personal affront and seem to be pulling put a lot of unfounded accusations just to try to get what you want. I don't even want to go into your ridiculous denial of snoring.\n\nYTA.", "I'm not a dog person... But dogs *are* soft and cuddly.", "I know I can definitely stand having pets touch me when I'm sleeping much more than people. I find that skin somewhat sticks and catches when it touches and that feeling drives me nuts", "My cats are soft and cuddly and I sleep perfectly fine with them. My bf is a damn rotisserie chicken in bed and is constantly rolling around. I specifically am not spending the night with him tonight actually because we\u2019re going out for drinks tomorrow and I need to be well rested for that (because that\u2019s how old I am now apparently)", "A split-king bed with two different top sheets/blankets is a game changer", "I'm so glad y'all found a happy compromise! And sorry about the nightmares, I have them too and can sympathize. I hope they get better! \n\nAnd FYI, they actually make a prescription drug specifically for nightmares. You might talk to your doctor about it.", "I'm a firm believer that it's on purpose.\n\nIt's like the cat/dog is remembering all the times we slighted them(In their minds) and are essentially like: \"Listen here fuck face this is what you get for only giving me 2 treats instead of the 20,000 I deserve!\"\n\nI'm living at my parents until my house gets finished this spring and I got an Alaskan Malamute puppy and she takes up less space than our miniature schnauzer does on my bed at this point. And she is larger than he is by a pretty big margin.\n\nShe just has the decency to lay either vertically right next to me or Horizontally near my pillows or at the end of my bed.", "They make little sofas for animals my cat loves. But also, move the damn cat! I love mine to death but trained him to cuddle up on the pillow or with my hand that goes under the pillow so he's comfortable and gets face scratches.", "My three cats have an apartment that they graciously allow my husband and I to live in and pay for.\n\nAnd since my husband and I both snore, I'm a light sleeper, and he stays up later than I do, we have separate bedrooms. 2 of the cats sleep with me and 1 sleeps with him.", "/r/usernamechecksout", "Thank you! I\u2019ll look into it.", "What medication is it?

If he puts a single paw on us while we're in bed you'll be damn sure we're holding in a pee so that we don't have to disturb him to go to the bathroom \ud83d\ude02 It's my favorite way of getting out of chores, \"I can't get up now, <cat> is lying on my lap\".", "Your so welcome! Good luck!", "I smoke weed to keep mine away, definitely not the healthiest but I\u2019d rather do that than scream myself awake every night.", "The one I am aware of is called Minipress (generic name prazosin). I dont have any personal experience with it; I am just aware of it through my therapist. \n\nAlso a non-prescription option to try is to think about your dream, but this time imagine how you want it to end. Change the nightmare so that it ends with a pleasant and empowering resolution. Taking control of your nightmare during your waking hours can actually help influence them in your sleep. \n\nPlease note that this is a treatment given to me by my therapist that has helped me a little, and it's a pretty common exercise. However, I'm in no way a doctor, and everyone is different, so I recommend speaking with a doctor or therapist before trying something that a well-intentioned internet stranger tells you lol.", "Prazosin. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist used for high blood pressure, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and nightmares (mostly PTSD-related).
