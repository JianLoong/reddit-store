So, I do get that you would feel left out and lonely because you look in and see them all snuggly and you're sleeping alone.    \nI think instead of thinking of her as a hypocrite, why not just tell her in a gentle and loving way, how you feel.  Openly communicate and both of you lay it on the table what the issues are that are keeping you apart.  She may actually not like sleeping with you for just the reasons she told you or she may have some past trauma or issues, who knows.  Snoring is definitely a very common issue that causes couples to sleep alone.  So, maybe you can try to address that issue and see if there's anything you an do for that.

My boys had me trapped in my recliner for over 6 hours today. Little bastards were so cute and so sweet and I got absolutely nothing done today. They tag team too. One on my feet and one on my lap and they rotate.", "Thank you for that extra info!", "Haha, one of my kitties will jump up if he thinks the person needs to get up. He wasn't trained to that though, he's just a very considerate kitty boy."]}
