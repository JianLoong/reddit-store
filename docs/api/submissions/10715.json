We have been completely no contact for about 2 years now (we went no contact a month or two before we got married). We made that decision after many incidents with them, one I have a previous post describing.\n\nRecently, we found out, via an old friend of my husband's family, that his mother was hospitalized. She was having some issue in her colon. She has a major infection, and they were having to do surgery to resect her colon (a procedure they had already had to do in the past). From what I understand, they were worried that she would not be able to handle the surgery and would pass away.\n\nWhen my husband got this message he called me, as he always does when we hear from anyone from our past, and he asked me what he should do. I asked him how he felt, and he said he was worried. I asked him if he really wanted his mother to die and for him to have never talked to her again and he said no. He expressed concern that they would try to pick a fight with him about our differences or would try to ignore everything like it never happened. I advised him to only respond to things directly related to his mother's condition and that if he was not ready to talk to them about anything else then he didn't have to. I feel as though he can express concern for her wellbeing and simultaneously not forgive them for what they have done.\n\nSince then, I have received multiple phone calls and texts from my family and his saying I am an asshole for \"keeping a mother and son apart\". My mom even told me that I should not be so selfish and unforgiving when his mom could die. I feel like I might be the asshole because maybe if I had not expressed my opinion, they would still have a relationship, and this would not be an issue today. I am just so confused, and I do not want my husband to end up resenting me.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA-\n\nThere are a couple things I wanted to address.\n\n1. We knew his mom was having health complications because his dad had been texting him previously, but he did not say she was in the hospital. We were not upset that he did not notify us, as we were no contact. \n2. My husband reached out to his dad because, despite our differences, he still loves his mom. He did not want her to die and not have had the chance to say goodbye. \n3. Being no contact with a family member does not mean you do not care. It does not mean you want them to die. It does not mean that person disappears from your thoughts. Its his MOTHER.

Once you've forgiven, then you aren't supposed to be holding on to the anger anymore so you're expected to not talk about it again.

The woman is on her deathbed and you've already \" won\" by marring her son. So just stop. \n\n When a family member does something inappropriate it is perfectly okay to be upset, and not want to talk to them, but to go completely no contact all of a sudden without any effort in communication first with them is immature and running away from the problem vs solving it.  Adults don't run away from conflict, they handle it. You do this by communicating calmly and respectfully to the other person what your boundaries are. You set the boundaries on what YOU will allow in your life rather than tell someine else  how to live their life because it is not your place to do that. You can say in a friendly and nice letter or text that you love them and want to see/talk to them but will have to leave/hang up if X subject is brought up. Or something similar to this. And if it happens, then just you just follow through. Sane as if it were a rule for a child.The amount of contact you have can be based upon how long/much you can tolerate that other person. If you are triggered easily then need to see them less often or for shorter anounts of time. If you can't talk to them then yes maybe go no contact for just you.Also there are so many levels of low contact - seeing them only for holidays, seeing them by themselves vs extended family, him visiting them without you - so many levels. Don't divide his family, instead make stedfast contributions towards his family in a way that is healthy for you and without expecting anything in return. Sending holiday cards never hurt anyone and is easy. Showing up to bridal/baby showers, weddings/ funerals is pretty easy too and noone says how long you have to stay. Although you may not like your MIL you can still be the bigger person for your husband because you love him and it makes him happy.  Giving her a birthday gift and card wont kill you. And who cares if she doesn't give you a gift back - you be the bigger person for your husband. Its not his fault and he shouldn't be punished because he has a family you dont like.", "So me and my husband kinda grew up together. For a long time he was like my best friend/big brother. We grew up in the same cult like religious church and there were not many kids so even though we are about 6 years apart, we are all we had. \n\nWhen I was a teenager I left the church and moved for a few years, during which we slowly lost touch like sometimes happens. When I came back I was 18 almost 19, or maybe I want already 19 I don\u2019t remember. We met up and started hanging out again and this time we fell in love. I know the age gap is a little weird for some people\u2026 but it works for us. I couldn\u2019t ask for someone better.", "Woah, lot of assumptions you made so let\u2019s go through them. \nMy husband does not want to be in contact with his family. HIS choice, not mine. I was the one who reached out to them through our 3 years of dating to try to get them to reconcile. I was the one who begged his mother and father to at least try to get to know me. We went low contact as a MUTUAL decision the year before we married because they called me a whore because I didn\u2019t want to be a stay at home wife and I like to wear pants.\n\nI stopped responding to his mothers religious rants at about year 3. Then about a month out from our wedding I posted my first post on Reddit about them. Through our entire relationship I have told him that it is HIS choice. That it is HIS family. And thus he makes the decisions in regards to them. \n\nHE chose to go no contact after a conversation that HE initiated where we discussed an incident where they weaponized him seeing his 12 year old sister.", "I have never once told him to stop talking to them or what to do in regards to them. \n\nBUT we are MARRIED. We are PARTNERS. Meaning he respects my opinion and asks for it. So when he asked me what I thought I told him, that personally, I require an apology for all the hell we have been through. If he doesn\u2019t then that is his choice, as it\u2019s his family and his life. And even he he had chosen to stay in contact with them I would not have. I am not going to put up with people who disrespect me and ignore me and call me a whore and protect abusers just because they are my husbands parents. That\u2019s called boundaries and standards.", "And finally, through everything they have put us through I have never so much as been disrespectful. I have remained calm and collected through horrible undeserved treatment. After the DISOWNED him. After they excommunicated us from the church. After they barred him from seeing his sister and told her he didn\u2019t love her anymore. Through all of that I STILL tried to reason with them.\n\nBut there is a limit to how much a person can and should taken. And that IS mature and reasonable.", "NTA. Because you didn't forbid him from seeing her. He asked you your opinion and it sounds like you helped guide him to a solution that was best for him.  Also he's a full grown man, if he really wanted to see MIL nothing's actually stopping him from doing so.  However it sounds like you  might have to stop sharing so much with your family. They're creating the drama because you told them too much. Might need to learn how to gray rock when it comes to topics involving your in-laws.", "you met back up and started dating at 18-19, then dated for 3 years and got married at 20? doesn't add up. i still think 5 year gap, that young, is odd, regardless of the cultish context.", "It sounds like you are doing the absolute best you can in horrible circumstances. I think you gave your husband as impartial of advice as you could muster and it was good advice. I think it\u2019s great you are supporting him in whatever decision he makes regarding his relationship with his parents while still maintaining your own boundaries and dignity. It sounds like you have a great marriage. I hope your husband finds peace with his mother before she dies.", "It is for sure young, I know. Uhm so let me break down the timeline, if it will even help, because I have a tendency to round. I think when we started dating I was 18 and some change, we got married in 2021, like a month before my 21st birthday. So I tossed away the 4-5 months and round to 3 years of dating. Sorry, I should have been more specific. \n\nBut I completely get that it\u2019s weird for some people. That\u2019s okay. I just want to show that we are happy and in a healthy relationship.", "Thanks!", "Seems awful patronising for them to assume your husband can't make his own decisions.\n\nFeels borderline patronising for you to assume your husband can't make his own decisions.", "[removed]", "Yeah, this post is dead on the money, OP.\n\nNTA", "My mother\u2026 unfortunately. We had a discussion afterwards about privacy..", " I would remind your mother that the reason you went NC with your MIL was because she refused to respect boundaries and that if your mother cannot do the same, she will be in the same boat.", "Well then you must be the devil incarnate who led their son away from their church - lol.  And apparently any failure in his part to be repentant is on you.  You did right by him and gave an opinion and told him to do what he felt.", "Mostly because as soon as he contacted them they started turning it around like it was not as serious as it sounded.", "NTA, the irony of them claiming you're keeping him away when you literally told him he should see her if he's worried.", ">blood is thicker than water\n\nWhy does that not apply to them? It's their son, as \"blood\" as can be, how dare they treat him badly?", "It\u2019s not like he was a 24 year old preying on a preteen\u2026", "Wills have to be filed with the state. Start there.", "My father was abusive (not physically, or I'd have called the police).  He died 15 years ago.  I have never forgiven him for the way he treated us, and I never will.  He did nothing to earn forgiveness, even though his death was *not* sudden (took several months).\n\nNTA.  I presume there's a very good reason you went NC.  You have a right to be informed about your MIL's progress, but she does not have the right to set her flying monkeys on you.", "Wait, wait, wait.  If this is a Christian denomination, then they should be following the belief that only God can forgive.  No one else needs to!  Loophole found.\n\n(Okay, it's a simplification of things, but 'to forgive is divine' means that forgiveness is only God's to grant after death.  OP can at least use that against the horrible family members.)", "The rule is no younger than half the age plus seven, isn't it?. So at 25 that is 19.5 and is ok. At 22 that's 18 and still ok. I don't think it's too bad."]}
