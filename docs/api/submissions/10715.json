We have been completely no contact for about 2 years now (we went no contact a month or two before we got married). We made that decision after many incidents with them, one I have a previous post describing.\n\nRecently, we found out, via an old friend of my husband's family, that his mother was hospitalized. She was having some issue in her colon. She has a major infection, and they were having to do surgery to resect her colon (a procedure they had already had to do in the past). From what I understand, they were worried that she would not be able to handle the surgery and would pass away. \n\nWhen my husband got this message he called me, as he always does when we hear from anyone from our past, and he asked me what he should do. I asked him how he felt, and he said he was worried. I asked him if he really wanted his mother to die and for him to have never talked to her again and he said no. He expressed concern that they would try to pick a fight with him about our differences or would try to ignore everything like it never happened. I advised him to only respond to things directly related to his mother's condition and that if he was not ready to talk to them about anything else then he didn't have to. I feel as though he can express concern for her wellbeing and simultaneously not forgive them for what they have done.\n\nSince then, I have received multiple phone calls and texts from my family and his saying I am an asshole for \"keeping a mother and son apart\". My mom even told me that I should not be so selfish and unforgiving when his mom could die. I feel like I might be the asshole because maybe if I had not expressed my opinion, they would still have a relationship, and this would not be an issue today. I am just so confused, and I do not want my husband to end up resenting me. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1677166017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a0csl/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_motherinlaw_after_she/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Has your husband visited her?", "NTA.\n\nYour advice to your husband sounds good to me.\n\nIf your MIL wronged you in some serious way, then she should apologise before you forgive her. Her being sick does not constitute an apology.\n\nIf you're not talking to them because of some trivial disrespect, then intimations of mortality are a good moment to hit the restart button in a relationship. But I assume it's something more serious than that.", "NTA.  You asked your husband how he felt and what he wanted to do.  What he does or doesn't do from there is his business.  he's a grown man capable of making his own decision.  You are under no obligation to see/speak to/visit anyone.  Neither is he.  If he chooses to, that's his deciion. if he chooses not to, its his decision.", "NTA\n\nMIL didn't even contact her son to tell him about what she is going through, healthwise, but you're being made the bad guy for keeping them apart.\n\n Did I understand your post correctly? He wants to talk to her but have the parameters restricted to her health situation, that is his prerogative. \n\nIf their relationship was such that it hinged on you not having opinions, it wasn't a strong relationship.", "NTA.  Your husband asked for your opinion and you gave it.  He's a big boy, he can make his own decisions.", "NTA and I say this from experience.\n\nAHs on their death beds or in the hospital do not suddenly become less toxic or abusive. They are still the same person. You are allowed to keep your boundaries intact. You need to make sure your husband is aware of the abuse you are receiving and is shutting that down.\n\nAs for your mother, she is being extremely disrespectful of your boundaries and encouraging you to open yourself to abuse. I would remind your mother that the reason you went NC with your MIL was because she refused to respect boundaries and that if your mother cannot do the same, she will be in the same boat.", "Why is anyone else, especially your parents, involved in this? Your husband asked your advice and you gave it to him. He\u2019s an adult who can make his own decisions. Stop telling everyone else his business. I know this isn\u2019t the question you asked, but NTA for giving husband advice.", "NTA. Assholes with health problems are still assholes and don't suddenly get a free pass. He can say his goodbyes without forgiveness, which must be earned. That's not on you.", "NTA. being sick/almost dying doesn\u2019t mean that you should be forgiven for anything. it\u2019s not your job to soothe her guilty conscience", "INFO \n\nThere\u2019s a huge gap in your story. You go from talking w your husband, to suddenly everyone messaging you. What happened in there? What did he decide to do? How did everyone even on your side of the family learn about it?", ">We have been completely no contact for about 2 years now...we found out, via an old friend of my husband's family...I have received multiple phone calls and texts from my family and his...I advised him to only respond to things directly related to his mother's condition...\n\nYou two must have an odd definition of what \"no contact\" means if you are fielding calls and texts from his family.  \n\nNAH. Your husband apparently has concern about his estrangement, especially with the additional factor of his mother's illness. Your other post about the wedding already put you front and center in these conflicts, so if you don't want to be labeled the villain in all this family drama then you need to step back and let your husband take the lead here.", "NTA\n\nYou set your boundaries. You are not required to forgive anyone for anything at any time for any reason, especially when they have not sought forgiveness at any time.\n\nThe reason they expect you to forgive them is because they still believe you are in the wrong. As long as they think that, they will never apologize.\n\n\u201cBy their fruit ye shall know them.\u201d I\u2019d say your former church\u2019s fruit is pretty rotten. I\u2019d be pissed too.\n\nHaving read your last post, your in-laws are the same kind of religious asshole I grew up with.\n\nTell them that he\u2019s more than allowed to do what he wants. But you will withhold your forgiveness until a genuine apology is made. They will call you cold and cruel, but even if you withhold forgiveness past this woman\u2019s death, you will never be as cruel as she was to her own son.", "NTA. Sounds like your husband is TA for throwing you under the bus after soliciting your opinion and then using it as an excuse for his own actions and diverting the wrath of your family and his onto you instead of on him.", "NTA. At all.", "NTA\nfirst of all, you are asking him what he wants and supporting his decision. You event \"pushed\" him to make contact (by asking him if he wanted her to for without having spoken to her). You helped him define boundaries of what he would tolerate from interacting with his family again, helping define what should be HEALTHY for HIM. He is your priority, he's your husband and it sounds like they've done nothing to earn your loyalty.\n\nAnd as said by others, being sick doesn't make everything a person did disappear, meeting instant forgiveness. Now if the sickness changed their attitude and they asked you guys for forgiveness it would be another story. \n\nAnd anyways, you are supporting his decision, not making it for him. That's what a real partner does and does and not something that should be criticized.", "Someone getting ill doesn\u2019t magically make them non-toxic or erase the past. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSomeone getting sick doesn\u2019t suddenly erase what they\u2019ve done. Your husband is a grown man and can decide himself if he wants to contact his mother", "INFO:\nI do not understand why people think you are keeping anyone apart when you sort of encouraged him to go see her, no? What were these other family members told to think you are, and who told them this?\n\nI am confused.", "From what he has been told, which is very little, the surgery went well and she is recovering. It is just going to be a while before she is back to normal, if she ever gets there 100%. Mostly because as soon as he contacted them they started turning it around like it was not as serious as it sounded.", "Definitely more than something small or trivial. I have another post about it, but basically it was religious trauma.", "Yes, he wants to know how she is doing and what is going on with her health. He is concerned about her, as she is his mother, and he still loves her but does not want it to be misconstrued as a sign that he has forgiven them for everything that they have put us through.", "After me and my husband talked, he decided to message his dad and ask how she is doing and what is going on and why we had to hear about it from a third party. I know that he also had brief discussion with several other people about her condition and they were trying to convince him to forgive her. The whole \"blood is thicker than water\" thing. When he told them that it was not open for discussion they were, in turn, upset. So then I started receiving messages about it. Saying that, as his wife, I should want them to have a good relationship and that if I loved him, I would tell him to do the right thing. \n\nWith my family it was like telephone. I am very close with my mom and I told her and she told... well everyone. And so, the pattern repeated with me getting messages from anyone who thought I should hear their two cents.", "We went no contact just before the wedding with his parents, not his entire family. The only time I have spoken to them since is to text his mother that we had gotten married. That was almost 2 years ago. I have not received anything from either of them since. \n\nHe occasionally get messages from his dad or mom on holidays and such but has no responded in two years. This is what I mean by no contact.", "I think this stems from when we first started dating. We went to the same church (THEIR church, his dad is a pastor). I has already quit the church the year before and when we had been dating about 8 months he finally left after we has a conversation about it. He had been wanting to leave for years but the church was all he knew, it is what he was raised in. He was home schooled. All his friends and family were in that church. His sudden departure caused everyone to cast blame on me for \"turning him away from god\".", "Then I think you are doing exactly the right thing. The people pushing you to forgive are either mistaking forgiveness with concern for health or alternatively don't think that the religious trauma was wrong in the first place. Other people's mistakes are not your problem though.", "I read your previous post and OMG, people are really a%#ho$&@ if they are berating you for something your husband\u2019s family did. \n\nJust because your MIL is having a critical surgery, it doesn\u2019t wash out everything they have done to you guys. Continue to be strong. NTA totally", "Please include this as an edit to your post. It is essential information and without it it is a very confusing post.", "This may be part of the problem. Why would YOU text his mother to tell them about getting married? Why wouldn't your husband do it himself?", "At that point he had both of his parents blocked. He had requested that I not block them in case of emergencies. I honestly do not know what compelled me. I was almost pleading with her and trying to reason with her so that she did not miss any more of her sons life. I don't know why. I just did."]}
