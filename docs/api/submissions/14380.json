My fiances father hates my guts and isn't shy about it. The main reason is that while I'm atheist (he'd be fine with just that) I come from a catholic family, and they're methodist. We've been together eight years, and I'm still not welcome in his house.\n\nAnyway my fiance is fine going ahead with the marriage whatever he says, but worries he'll try something if we don't ask him first. So she wanted me to ask his blessing, even though I consider that a pretty gross tradition, seeing as he doesn't own my fiance. But I did agree to it, but made it clear I would not respect a no and would tell him such.\n\nSo she set up a meeting for us (otherwise I'd never get near him) and I made my case. I told him right off the bat that I want to marry her, she wants to marry me, and since we're consenting adults that's it. I told him that it's important to her that I clear this with him, but his opinion on my adult relationship means nothing to me and this is a formality. Whether or not he approves won't change a thing, as his daughter is not his property and can make her own decisions.\n\nHe not only refused, he also told me to break things off that week and that he'd \"bring hell on me\" if I ever saw his daughter again. I reminded him I'm not scared to press charges and left. Obviously we're still together, and my fiance chewed him out on the phone. Half her family has either called or texted me telling me to leave, and leaving some pretty nasty threats. My own father even got a call from my fiance's, telling him to \"control his kid\" which my dad didn't appreciate, and basically told him he'd sue if they didn't back off.

Saying right of the bat, we\u2019re getting married whatever you say and your opinion means nothing to me isn\u2019t really asking for permission is it?
