He pointed out that I had put off washing the griddle after using it, and considering that this was literally the first thing he had greeted me with that morning, I gave an exasperated sigh, something he immediately took offense to. After apologizing for the sigh, my father decided he wasn't done. He decided he was going to thump his chest some more and give me three choices: do more chores and do so \"without attitude\", pay more to them in rent (already paying roughly $200 per two weeks to them while on Section 8), or move out. At that moment, I got irate, and after telling him he can go fuck himself I left to stay at a hotel for a few days (but not before both my mom and sister both texted me to antagonize me some more).\n\nWhile I was at the hotel, I mulled over how I was going to apologize to the family, but also thinking about why my parents felt the need to charge rent while we were all on Section 8. The conclusion I came to, they were being reckless with money again. I say again because they have had a history of this sort of recklessness; one does not buy a diner across the country and experiment with unfamiliar recipes without being financially irresponsible. On top of this, they actually owed ME money, as well; from that little stunt alone, they had me sell my car and withheld paychecks to cover their asses when the restaurant, unsurprisingly, floundered and failed. I decided I would go back and offer to pay more in rent, with the condition that they key me in on their spending habits just a bit. I figured this was fair, because we're on the government payroll for a lot of things, and what wasn't being covered was essentially being paid for with that money and my dad's retirement fund.\n\nThis didn't go over well. I got into the house, and tried to explain the idea in an incredibly calm manner. I maintained this composure for about 10 minutes as my parents accused me of blackmail, threatened to counter-sue for an imaginary lawsuit I was filing, attempt to gaslight me for the events of me leaving the house, and so forth. It got to the point where my dad decided to verbally declare an eviction notice on me, which in the state of Colorado is illegal for him to do without due process and to carry out as a co-tenant (of which I was listed as on the contract). I have since gone no-contact with them, and good riddance; however, the assumption that I might have been in the wrong hasn't left my mind.\n\nTL;DR: Am I the asshole for asking for accountability as to where my money is going from my parents, who have historically been reckless and irresponsible with financial matters?", "created_utc": 1688568869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14rcyjj/aita_for_pointing_out_my_financially/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When they stop paying rent, you'll be on the hook.", "NTA You should contact someone over section 8 and let them know that you were being charged rent and don't live there anymore.", "You weren\u2019t wrong to ask- they are upset because it would show you that they were basically stealing from you, you were their ATM. You are better off being no contact with them.. NTA", "NTA- move out. How much do they owe you? Is it a  significant amount? Do you have the terms of the loan in writing? Or something proving they owe you money? Either way, moving out will be the best way to financially show them they need you more than you need them. Good luck", "I am currently 32, and I admit that seems odd; however, half of the time past the age of 20 was spent trying to fight the SSA over Disability, if that explains why I was still living with my parents adequately enough.\n\nAs for Section 8, I'm not 100% sure how that works. I do know that my dad is also on Disability in addition to on a retirement plan, and my mother is on SSI.", "I just had to establish that you were an adult, to know whether they were right to charge rent. And I think they are. \n\n>As for Section 8, I'm not 100% sure how that works.\n\nPerhaps you should look into this? It seems like you're basing a lot of your argument with them on the assumptions you have made about their financial situation. \n\nI don't think they need to explain what they're spending money on for you to pay them rent. They are your landlords essentially. You don't get to grill your landlord about what they're spending your rent on!\n\nBut I also think you made the right move by leaving!", "My personal judgements about whether or not it's right to ask them about their spending habits aside, I do have to point out that they were not landlords. On the paperwork I had signed (and had confirmed I signed when I asked the housing agency to be taken off the contract), my parents and I were considered co-tenants.\n\nJust wanted to make sure that point was known. Otherwise, I thank you for your input!", "What are you talking about? OP specifically states they are co-tenants, OP and OP's parents have the *same* landlord.", ">my parents and I were considered co-tenants.\n\nAnd you don't know how much the rent is? Or how much is covered by section 8? Do they handle all the bills? How much do you pay of the bills?", "Yes, that has been clarified (more politely) already. But her parents pay the rent, organise the section 8 stuff, pay the bills, buy the groceries, and OP gives them $200 a fortnight. They may all be tenants, but she doesn't pay her rent directly to her landlords. She doesn't even know how much the rent is.", "Hence why I wanted the accountability. They kept me in the dark about not only what they spent their personal money on, but also things like basic groceries and rent. I can only imagine that it ties in to the reason why I fought the SSA for six years (Autism, Bipolar Disorder, anxiety disorders, etc), because in that time they didn't clue me in on how much anything should cost.", "Sure? But all of your reasoning is based on OP's parents being their landlords, and they aren't. If OP is just giving a share of rent to their parents, who then pay the landlord, OP has *every* right to know that 100% of that money is going towards the rent they're paying their share of.", "It shouldn't really be their responsibility to clue you in on how much everything costs (although I do think they should share that info on request). If you are a co-tenant it is your responsibility to know what the rent costs, and what your section 8 voucher covers. \n\n>They kept me in the dark about not only what they spent their personal money on\n\nThis is the part that keeps flummoxing me.. it is none of your business. \n\n>but also things like basic groceries and rent.\n\nDoes this mean that your $200 every fortnight covers food and bills as well as rent?\n\nYou can find out how much your groceries cost pretty easily. Just Google the store your parents buy things from. \n\nWhile it is odd and frustrating that they won't share this information with you, much of it can be discovered on your own. You're a co-tenant... call your landlord and ask. Go on the grocery store website. Search for the providers of your services and look at their price plans.", ">OP has every right to know that 100% of that money is going towards the rent they're paying their share of.\n\nIt doesn't. It also goes to their household bills and grocery bills. They do have the right to know that information. I've said that to them. I've also said that they should be paying the landlord directly and know how much their rent is.. and they could just ask their landlord without needing their parents involvement at all.", "ESH--- YOU ARE 32 YEARS OLD....MOVE OUT   \nOh I get it, its expensive, trust me I know. But if you are gonna sit there and complain and pick apart every single thing they've done...then just GTFO. Its THEIR house. Wash your fucking dishes or leave. Its that easy. It doesn't matter if they are section 8- YOU ARE AN ADULT.", "NTA.  You have 2 entitled & very selfish parents, who are also toxic & abusive.  Going NC is the first step.  I hope you have blocked them & intend to stand your ground.  Just bc they're the parents doesn't make them autimatically right.  It's your money & you have every right to know how it's being used.", "YTA.  Having dealt with section 8 (other people), it is not free rent.  It is usually partially covered or lower rent.  They still have some rent and other bills to pay.  Quite often someone on disability will get barely enough to pay their portion of the rent and the other bills and have nothing or very little left for food, etc.  You living there does cost money.  You should move out and support yourself.  It really isn\u2019t asking too much for you to clean up after yourself so others don\u2019t walk in to find your mess in the morning.", "You are 32, if only you would wash up after yourself none of this would happen. \n\nAnd please stop making this about their financial situation. Its about the fact that you are mooching off of THEM. Not that they are mooching off the government like you seem to hint at.", "Hes a 32 year old man. \n\nIf only cleaned his dishes this wouldnt be an issue. \n\nYTA", "They are co-tenants paying a landlord. So no it's not their house. They're roommates.", "How it works is the parents receive subsidized housing from the government and then are also receiving rent from OP which seems like may be illegal double dipping?\n\nETA: it appears that parents handle the rental and all household expenses and OP contributes $200 for room and board, including utilities etc. It also sounds like they expect OP to participate in the family by doing chores etc.\n\nBased on that, ESH.\n\nParents are doing OP no favors by withholding financial info (and my guess is the info would show $800 does not cover OPs living expenses) but it does not sound like the arrangement is financially abusive to OP. The refusal to discuss and angry response etc. place GT parents firmly in Camp Asshole.\n\nBut. OP is on the lease but has made zero effort to find out what that means or even what the monthly rent is; has no idea even what groceries or other bills cost. OP needs to take some responsibility. Paying $800 towards your living expenses does not get you off the hook for the regular chores that came with living in a family. If OP doesn't want to do chores then they should not expect similar treatment (cooking meals etc.) by the parents that benefit OP."]}
