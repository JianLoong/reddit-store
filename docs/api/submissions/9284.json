My dad had given me an investor relations type of role at his company so we were traveling a lot and then after that our kids needed our attentions. \n\nAfter our twins were born my wife was bedridden for longer than we and even the doctors expected. Since we had to hire extra hands to do the childcare tasks that involved mobility my wife had some time on her hands.\n\nHer mother told her that her friend who proctors at a testing center said that they give GED tests basically every week ( at least across the state of Idaho) and that she should dust off her general education knowledge. She started browsing her laptop and decided to enroll in a GED prep class online.\n\nIt seems she was better at self paced learning than classroom learning because the stuff they were testing her on came way easier to her now than it did then even though she's been away from structured classroom instruction for many years now.\n\nEven after she was back on her feet, she'd be studying for it after she dropped the older two off to their respective schools. I would see what she was studying and it looked pretty rudimentary and I knew that getting a GED basically means nothing and that she probably wouldn't be able to apply it to anything career wise, or commit full time to community college, where I doubt the job prospects for students are that great right now either.\n\nSo my wife ended up taking the test and the other day she bounded into the room and said \" Yes! I passed, I passed!\"\n\nI knew she would since she was doing well on the practice tests and the GED consistently tests on the same rudimentary topics. I did not gripe at her but merely nodded at her and went back to answering an important email from a client.\n\nMy wife seemed to get upset and I asked her what was wrong. She said I didn't seem that excited and I said that it's great that she passed but I have been telling her that it was easy and no big deal, but if she needed something to prove to herself she knew the high school concepts, I guess the money was well spent.\n\nShe got even more upset and said she worked very hard and this was the essential building blocks to being able to start a career.\n\nAITA? My wife passed her GED test, but she wasn't exactly graduating from college and wouldn't be for at least 15 years. I just didn't see any immediate applicability to her test but I am glad she had something to challenge her while she was coming off being unable to fully care for the kids.", "created_utc": 1675696912, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v97vh/aita_for_not_acting_impressed_by_my_wifes/", "score": 4481, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't matter whether *you* think it is easy or important. *She* is proud of it. Try being supportive instead of taking her down.\n\nAlso, for god's sake, she has sacrificed a ton for the family. It sounds like she put her personal goals on hold, and took a serious blow to her health for the sake of having your guys' children. Did she *want* to give up on a career? Why did you two choose to have babies right away instead of waiting for her to finish college?\n\nNow she is taking the first steps to start pursuing what *she* wants to do for herself, and you demean her.\n\n>life got in the way\n\nYour life got in her way.

Meanwhile Daddy handed you a job and you reek of self importance.", "YTA.  You have \"important emails\" from clients to answer and your wife having five young children under the age of seven was finally able to get her GED and you sniff.

This is not a hard concept.", "YTA. Your a major AH. Your wife is trying to look after five children and found the time to get her GED. Why don\u2019t you let her go out of town for a week and see how hard it is to look after five small children . Would it have killed you to get up hug her and tell her how proud you of her? Maybe take her out to dinner one night to celebrate? Wow. I hope this isn\u2019t indicative the respect you give her the rest of the time.", "YTA.

A GED means she can apply to college, which is a lot. It also means her overall job prospects are better because most retail establishments require at least a HS/GED diploma. Which means she can get a job and get away from your sorry ass. Even if she can't commit to community college full time right now, that doesn't mean she can't go part-time, or take online classes. Depending on what field she may want to go into, job prospects can be good. Perhaps you need some education yourself.", "I mean I hate to beat this dead horse but let me just spell it out again, YTA. \n\nI\u2019m a vocational counselor in my state. Getting your GED is a big effing deal for future employment prospects. It\u2019s impressive she studied and worked for it in her limited time with so much childcare and in a self-learning format too (a lot of my clients struggle with this). It also sounds like it gave her a big confidence boost. Why are you belittling her accomplishment? Do you actually like your wife?", "YTA - she's birthed 5 kids in 6 years. She is exhausted.

Your wife has been pregnant for basically every single year since you got together. She got married at a young age and became a mother shortly after. I think it\u2019s wonderful she decided to get her GED when the \u201ceasier\u201d option would just be to continue living without it. She put in the work to earn something for herself and clearly has career goals that you never cared to ask her about.\n\nYou had a decent job handed to you due to your father\u2019s position and then you have the nerve to say her GED is pointless when it is literally the basic requirement for almost any job you can get as an adult.", "YTA.

I hope the attainment of the GED is a step along the path to freeing herself from you.", "YTA i stopped reading at your line of \"GEDs mean nothing\" because that's false. I helped my first ex get his and everyone we talked to about getting it, said employers basically look at it as one step above a regular Diploma because the person did that without a whole school pushing them. A regular diploma is not hard to get but a GED takes your own actions.\n\nYou really couldn't spare 5 minutes to celebrate something with your wife ? You really can't just be excited about something she's excited about ? \n\nI hope she finds a job she enjoys because you sound miserable to be with", "Info: why did you marry this woman? You don\u2019t seem to have an ounce of respect for her.", "YTA.  How are you so clueless that you would think anyone with an ounce of empathy would tell you that you aren't?", "YTA. She sacrificed her high school diploma and college to raise your kids and you can't be bothered to support her going back to school? If she divorces you for being a dick you'll be taking care of the kids alone each weekend, paying alimony and child support and I predict that she'll have her college degree in 6 years or less. Boom- solved her problems.", "YTA of the highest order. \n\nWhen I\u2019m in a romantic relationship with someone, I hold his opinion in the highest regard. He will be the very first person I consult with my problems, and the very first person who hears of my accomplishments. If my partner reduced and dismissed my accomplishment the way you did your wife\u2019s, I would be crushed. That kind of apathy, that kind of flippancy from the one person who is supposed to love and celebrate and support you.. that is the kind of thing that wounds your heart for a really long time. Most people have painful memories that manage to find ways to resurface over the course of their lives- and this memory your wife has of you, that may become one of those painful, resurfacing memories she has. And you will be responsible for that. She was excited to share this thing she is proud of, she wanted her husband that she loves to be proud of her, and you completely shot her down. This is how a marriage dies. When you squander these opportunities for positivity and love and connection between you and your partner, you are on a fast track path to divorce. \n\nI also have a feeling the reason your wife did not graduate from HS is because she was busy supporting *you* in your career. You said it yourself. Life got in the way and she was traveling with *you.* The fact your wife set aside her education to tag along with you speaks to the commitment she has to you as a man. That\u2019s some real ride or die shit right there. Now she\u2019s finally able to accomplish this educational goal, no doubt an accomplishment made even harder by the sacrifices she made for you, and you can\u2019t even be proud of her for it. Which makes this even more heinous.\n\nYou don\u2019t deserve the level of vulnerability or depth I gave you in this comment. But I\u2019m hoping that it will give you even a semblance of a come to Jesus moment with your own terrible fucking behavior, because your wife deserves better. I hope these comments make you feel bad enough to where the guilt and shame you *should* be feeling can hopefully turn your shit around.\n\nRemember this above all. If you continue on this trajectory you will face your karma and it will manifest in the future relationships of your daughters. If you do not want them to marry men who will mistreat them, stop mistreating their fucking mother.", "YTA\n\nJesus you could have at least said well done. Bought her fav take-away as a treat or some flowers to say congratulations.\n\nShe worked hard, passed a test. You could have at least let her know you're proud of her. \n\nJeez, do you even like your wife?", "YTA\n\nYou seem very controlling. The fact that she has accomplished something that strengthens her standing employment wise should be celebrated, not making you clearly annoyed. I hope she continues down this path of further education and gets the hell away from you.", "YTA for not supporting and uplifting your partner.\n\nEdit, you're actually double the asshole for putting accomplishments in quotation marks. \n\nSays a lot about who you are.", "YTA\n\nYou couldn't be a bit happy for your wife's accomplishment?  \n\nHow do you really feel about her, because this line:  'but I am glad she had something to challenge her while she was coming off being unable to fully care for the kids' makes it sound like you are a complete asshole.", "YTA. Dude, it doesn't matter how small of an achievement it seemed to you, it was obviously a huge thing to her, so you should have at least faked being exciting for her sake.", "YTA as a someone who became a young mother at 17 I get why she was so excited!

Since we had to hire extra hands to do the childcare tasks that involved mobility my wife had some time on her hands.\n\nHer mother told her that her friend who proctors at a testing center said that they give GED tests basically every week ( at least across the state of Idaho) and that she should dust off her general education knowledge. She started browsing her laptop and decided to enroll in a GED prep class online.\n\nIt seems she was better at self paced learning than classroom learning because the stuff they were testing her on came way easier to her now than it did then even though she's been away from structured classroom instruction for many years now.\n\nEven after she was back on her feet, she'd be studying for it after she dropped the older two off to their respective schools. I would see what she was studying and it looked pretty rudimentary and I knew that getting a GED basically means nothing and that she probably wouldn't be able to apply it to anything career wise, or commit full time to community college, where I doubt the job prospects for students are that great right now either.\n\nSo my wife ended up taking the test and the other day she bounded into the room and said \" Yes! I passed, I passed!\"\n\nI knew she would since she was doing well on the practice tests and the GED consistently tests on the same rudimentary topics. I did not gripe at her but merely nodded at her and went back to answering an important email from a client.\n\nMy wife seemed to get upset and I asked her what was wrong. She said I didn't seem that excited and I said that it's great that she passed but I have been telling her that it was easy and no big deal, but if she needed something to prove to herself she knew the high school concepts, I guess the money was well spent.\n\nShe got even more upset and said she worked very hard and this was the essential building blocks to being able to start a career.\n\nAITA? My wife passed her GED test, but she wasn't exactly graduating from college and wouldn't be for at least 15 years. I just didn't see any immediate applicability to her test but I am glad she had something to challenge her while she was coming off being unable to fully care for the kids.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA and a huge one at that! Your wife was bedridden and chose to dedicate her time towards something useful. I'll be honest, in her situation I probably would have watched a lot of Real Housewives. But your wife chose to study instead and then continued to study around your kids' schedules. That's amazing! \n\nMy mom had to quit school when she was 16 (her father forced her to quit so she could take care of the house and her younger siblings). She studied hard and got her GED after having her second baby, my older sister. She was always so proud when she talked about it, and deservedly so. My mom was one of the smartest people I've ever known, certainly smarter than most of the people I went to law school with, but studying for and passing the GED exam while taking care of her small children was still difficult for her. My father encouraged her and celebrated her accomplishment because that's exactly what it was- a true accomplishment!", "YTA no need to post a reason. Reread your post. There's your reasons.", "This is a big fucking deal to her and you just shit all over it. What is wrong with you?\n\nYTA. What the fuck.", "YTA and a massive one at that. \n\nYou minimised an achievement that your wife was proud of and basically acted like it was a waste of time. \n\nShe was excited and you took that away from her. \nYou sound like a miserable person.", "YTA - why don\u2019t you like your wife?", "Such an AH. You knocked her up at 17? Betting you didn\u2019t go to college since your dad gave you a \u201cinvestor relations type of role\u201d, like what even is that? You\u2019ve done nothing tbh. She brought the kids into this world, she raises them, drops them at school, and passes the GED so that she can get a job and apply to college, and you? Got a job handed to you and kept impregnating this poor girl.", "YTA. Your wife literally put her life on hold and as someone else said, you got handed a job from your daddy and somehow that makes you better? \n\nAlso a GED is the equivalent to a highschool diploma, she can do a lot with it, and it opens a lot of doors that would have otherwise been closed. You\u2019re a shit husband who needs to do better at supporting your wife. You can only have the job you have, BECAUSE she\u2019s raising your kids and running your household. \n\nGet better and do better by your wife.", "YTA. And you have an elitist attitude. I hope your wife realizes she can do better than you. Also, if you knew the history of the GED program, you wouldn't turn your nose up at it.", "YTA\n\nYou are trying to trap her... A GED will help her get work in the future... AND a DECENT spouse is happy about ALL accomplishments. Why don't you want her to be able to work? Why are you squashing her enthusiasm in learning? You know this is a great thing for your kids to see right? Mom didn't graduate but she is working HARD to learn and earn that. That is a big deal.", "YTA. When someone is happy or excited about something you should reciprocate that energy. Why would you want to make your wife feel shitty? You can't undo that moment now and she'll forever remember you took the wind out of her sails instead of being her biggest supporter. \n\nI'm so annoyed at you for belittling her achieving and not even making the tiniest effort. It would have taken you 20 seconds to stand up, grin and say well done you are amazing! The woman you love wasn't worth 20 seconds of effort to you and that makes you a shitty husband.", "YTA.\n\nBig time.\n\nShe deserved a much better response from you than that.", "Holy *shit* YTA. Fucking hell, guy. It would have taken literally zero time or energy to feign even marginal excitement, and not only did you not do that bare minimum thing, but you then put down this thing she is clearly very proud of (which is all that matters- that she's proud, not whether you think it's valid for her to be proud). What the fuck.", "This was a big deal to your wife. It was clearly important to her, and as you say, life got in the way of her finishing high school. She put her life and ambitions on hold to take care of and be with you and your family.\n\nNow she\u2019s gotten her GED. She studied for it, and according to you did very well despite the fact that she occasionally struggled in school. \n\nYou sure are ready to shit all over her accomplishments for someone whose biggest accomplishments are working in the cushy position his daddy gave him and getting a woman pregnant 4 times.\n\nLose your insecurities, grow up, be a better man and supportive husband instead of someone who lifts his wife up instead of pushing her down. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. If daddy hadn't given you a job, you probably wouldn't be where you are. She worked for this. Be happy for her. Why is that so hard?", "\u201cMy wife intended to graduate high school the year we got married but life got in the way.\u201d\n\nMarrying you got in the way.\n\nYTA.", "i, personally, would leave and take the kids, if disrespected like that. next time try \u201ci\u2019m proud of you, congrats\u201d instead of \u201cdo better\u201d. after she raises YOUR children??  literally comical. ick unlocked <3", "YTA biiiiiiiiiiiig time.", "Anybody who sets a goal, particularly one they\u2019re intimidated by, and meets it should be celebrated. And a good partner celebrates with them. YTA!", "YT SUPER A! Your wife sacrificed EVERYTHING to birth and raise your children. She then made the commitment to get her GED, accomplished that goal and your response was, \u201cMeh.\u201d Dude you made the woman you\u2019re supposed to love and the mother of your children feel like NOTHING. I don\u2019t know what you have to do to fix this, but I suggest that you go buy her a cap and gown, find the music for \u201cPomp and Circumstance\u201d, and organize a family graduation ceremony and party in her honor.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nHow much of a condescending AH can you be?? Your wife has made sacrifices for *years* that have contributed to your success (on top of being given a job from Daddy) and you sit there belittling and diminishing the work she put into passing her GED while parenting 5 young children, 2 of them twins???", "This can\u2019t be real, no remotely decent human being would be able to write this all out and still think they\u2019re somehow not an ahole\u2026\n\nYTA - like a really really big one!", "YTA. You\u2019re so salty. For what? Your wife put her life on hold and couldn\u2019t even get her highschool diploma because you knocked her up, and then she spends years taking care of kids while you get a fancy role given by daddy. The one thing she got going on for herself and you stomp on it. Tell me how you think you possibly can\u2019t be an asshole.", "YTA so much lol. She's been a ball of nerves, studying and stressing. Also caring for 5 stairsteppers, 2 of them being toddlers. Not to mention whatever she deals with from you. \n\nLiterally could have just said congratulations, love. And asked her if she wanted to celebrate. Why burst her bubble? That's sowing seeds of hatred. She'll stop sharing her accomplishments. And if she can't celebrate accomplishments with you, she'll either stop accomplishing things or accomplish enough to ghost you. Fingers crossed for the latter.", "YTA: You\u2019re condescending af", "YTA -  OP, what the hell is wrong with you? Your wife was proud and excited, AS SHE SHOULD BE. Getting your GED IS an accomplishment. You seemingly had the privilege of graduating from high school on time. Completing your post-secondary is no easy feat the longer you're out of school, especially with children. And you're wrong, many jobs that don't require a degree or college diploma DO ask for a high school diploma or equivalent - these tend to be better, more stable entry level clerical jobs.\n\nEdit: On top of that your dad handed you an investor position and you really have the audacity to act like you've accomplished much more than being a spoiled brat.", "YTA. It would have cost you Zero Dollars to show some kindness and consideration to the person you have pledged to love and honor, the one who sacrificed herself and made YOUR career possible. She deserves better. I hope her next husband treats her with kindness and respect that she has earned.", "You know why you didn\u2019t celebrate her accomplishment. I know you know why. And it\u2019s not because it was \u201ceasy and not important\u201d. You\u2019re discrediting what she did to quell any of her future attempts to better herself. You want her right where she currently is: under your thumb. And just remember, if it wasn\u2019t for your daddy and your wife, you would have zero of the \u201csuccess\u201d you have now. YTA", "YTA\n\nSo, you impregnated your wife when you were 21 and she was in high school. You keep her pregnant and popping out your kids, making it near impossible for her to get her GED and gain any independence. Then shoot her down when she gets a GED.\n\nSounds like you don't want her to be able to take care of herself, or to even feel good about herself. These are the building blocks of an abusive relationship.\n\nBy virture of the fact that you're asking if you're the asshole, I'm hopeful that, for your wife's sake, you're only an asshole.", "YTA. As her husband, her life partner, the father of her kids, you should be making her feel like she's accomplished something huge (which she has), even if you feel that it's \"easy\". GED work is hard for some people. You made her feel like she did nothing good when she did. It's a huge accomplishment for her.", "Do you even like your wife?\n\nYTA", "YTA. A relationship is about being there for your partner at every opportunity. You had the chance to uplift your wife, the mother of your children who has gone through a traumatic experience, which she overcame to complete her GED; yet instead you insulted her to her face? Why? What was there to gain from hurting her feelings? When you knew it was important to her because she put her head down and worked hard.\n\nYou sound like a giant prick. I hope your wife is able to find happiness, with or without you. She deserves it. And I hope you find the number to a local therapist's office.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "YTA. It's not a big deal to you but it was for your wife. It's been a long time since high school for her, this is something that she might have been holding onto for a very long time. You minimized her feelings but saying it was easy. Why couldn't you give her a big hug and say, \"I knew you'd pass\"?", "YTA. This post made me so sad and disgusted, although not nearly as much as your wife is likely feeling. Wow.", "Y\u2019all are Mormon aren\u2019t ya", "So she sacrificed her own education to support your career and raise your children but the moment she does something for herself you can't be bothered to be happy for her?

Your wife works hard to support a family with 5 children and still found the time to study and pass the test. Get off your high horse and put things into perspective for a moment.

You didn't even give the bare minimum. YTA", "YTA. A major one. She couldn't graduate because \"life got in the way\". More like she probably became a teen mom with you and her life came to a screeching halt. I feel so sorry for her. I hope she enrolls in college and can finally start her life. She's more than a wife and mother. She had hopes and dreams and she put them off for you and continued popping out kids for you. She is proud of her accomplishment, let her have this.", "YTA. Why belittle something something she clearly worked hard at and did for herself? As her partner you should be supporting her, surely it\u2019s not hard to act excited for her.

This is so sad :(", "YTA \n\nI went to college and can confidently say if I had to go write the GED right now I\u2019d fail (and I\u2019m less than 10 years out it high school). \n\nYeah maybe it\u2019s not the biggest accomplishment she could get but it\u2019s an accomplishment nonetheless and you straight up dismissed her. Are you this disrespectful with your kids too?", "YTA. She did accomplish something. And you put it in quotes and provided a bunch of additional information that's just noise. You sound insufferable.", "Man honestly I have some very choice words I\u2019d like to tell you but I\u2019m simply gonna say wow what an AH you are. Hug your wife, tell her you\u2019re sorry for invalidating her and that with 5 kids you understand how much she sacrifices and busts her ass for the family.

You think you\u2019re gonna stop her until your youngest kids are out of high school? I\u2019d like to see you try. YTA", "Yta. Yeah, it\u2019s not a phd or anything, but you shouldn\u2019t dismiss someone\u2019s accomplishments like that. She was obviously excited about it, so you could have at least smiled and said \u201cthat\u2019s great! Good work, I\u2019m proud of you\u201d or something.

She needed this for herself and you just brushed her off. \n\nAnd the GED isn't nothing. I only have a GED but have a college level job. \n\nI feel so bad for your wife.", "YTA. lol you are a dude who got his job because of his daddy yet you are acting like your wife getting any kind of education by herself is not worth praising? all you had to do was praise her and tell her she did a good job but instead u decided to be a condescending asshole.", "YTA , just out of curiosity, do you actually like or love your wife? Because this post makes it seem like she's just something you keep around for the sake of convenience.", "Just came to add my voice to the pile. YTA hugely YTA you're such a massive AH I can hardly believe it.", "Holy shit. If you\u2019re like this about everything idk how you\u2019re still married. My partner high-fived me this morning for unloading the dishwasher. They\u2019d have taken me out for dinner for passing any kind of test. They would have brought the kids in and talked about how hard I worked and how proud we all should be. This has been hanging over your wife\u2019s head for 8 years! And it sounds like one reason she didn\u2019t graduate is because she was following you around. How can you not support her in an accomplishment she\u2019s proud of? \n\nEven the way you talk about it sucks. Instead of saying it was easy so it\u2019s no big deal, you could have told her you always believed in her and knew she\u2019d do well. But you have to trivialize it like an asshole. YTA", "Yta.

Honestly give it another few years I wouldn't be surprised if she ends up leaving you.", "YTA. From the top of a mountain, everything below looks small. From the base, everything looks insurmountably high. \n\nYou failed to consider your wife's perspective, her feelings, her motivation. In short, you didn't consider anyone's needs but your own. In this way you are the asshole. A GED might not be the height of academia, but it's progress, and any impulse to move forward is to be praised, especially with the significant drag force of many children and a completely unsupportive partner. \n\nI would suggest you realign your priorities. If you're expecting everything in your life to be  directly beneficial to you and your finances, then you're not going to be very happy or liked.

I was working too much to be able to continue classes and didn't complete a degree, but I was accepted and did attend.\n\nIt 100% makes a difference to employers. It absolutely does allow her to apply it to a career. I make $80k+ a year with only a GED. I'm upper middle management and made it to that point in about 5 years from entry level.

I mean I remember when I was young my mother decided to finish her associates even though she was a stay at home mom it had been 15+ years and had no intentions of a career afterwards and my dad who has three masters and a doctorate while working a very demanding full time job celebrated every step of the way. We had a fancy dinner when she enrolled, got a cake after class registration, had homemade pasta and fancy meals with every course she completed, and most of all I remember her packing me and my sister in the car to drive to the base and his office because she wanted to see his face the second she found out she was graduating and I was buckled in the mini van watching them jump hug and dance on the sidewalk outside. I was maybe 7/8 years old and my sister was 5/6 and both of us said when it came time to graduate and potentially continue our education that moment motivated it and showed us how important it was. It also helped me find and pick a life partner that loves me enough to celebrate every moment we can the way they deserve to be celebrated.", "YTA.

Wife, if you are reading this, you are amazing and so strong and you can achieve whatever you put your mind to. Find support where you can locally, get yourself a cheering squad because you deserve it!

When I registered for Community College, my partner bought a new Apple laptop for me and told me that it was because he wanted me to know that he believes in me, which made me feel so good.  You are the opposite of that, you\u2019re completely dismissing an accomplishment that your wife worked really hard for, that has to hurt her feelings and her confidence terribly.  You\u2019re a piss poor excuse of a partner, and something tells me that you don\u2019t want your wife becoming independent of you and starting a career of her own, you want her at home and dependent on you.

The GED was the first step.\n\nGetting it while at home with 5 small children? A massive accomplishment.\n\n YTA. Your post reeks of disdain and fear that you will be outpaced by your wife.

Wow.\n\nLike really, OP\u2014I hope you go to therapy, please, for your children\u2019s sake. \n\nOr that your wife takes them with her when she inevitably realizes that being treated like a lesser person than her partner is unacceptable. This is not how you treat someone you see as an equal. And after everything she has sacrificed for your family, too.\n\nI\u2019m am honestly stunned.

Learn to enjoy the things that make her happy, even if it's just in the form of seeing her happy. Recognize that not every achievement is 100% about how \"marketable\" it is. This sounds like it's just something she needed for herself.\n\nMy dad got his at age 63 when he already had owned his own business for 40+ years and used it to support his family and raise his kids.

(Source: me, 21 years in the cult) Couples are encouraged to have kids early and to have as many as possible. It's a very patriarchal system, where a women's only purpose is to raise kids, and be housewives and help mates for their husbands. OP probably decided for her that she didn't need to finish high school once their first child was born. The men see it as a \"privilege\" to be able to stay home and not work. But the women aren't really given any alternatives, and because they are raised to believe it's the best way to live, I'm sure it's very appealing at first. It usually means that the husbands contribute little, if anything, to the child rearing or household chores. They bring in the money (with help from daddy, in OP's case, so no real struggle or challenge there) and make all decisions for the family.  The wife, on the otherhand, gets to work 24/7 for the rest of her life, but she should be grateful because hey, she doesn't have to work a 9 to 5 and answer client emails. \n\nP.S. the stance on education has changed slightly over the years, but its really only lip service.
