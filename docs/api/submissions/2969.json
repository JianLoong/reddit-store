I think in any situation where you are giving things to strangers, especially if those things are edible and especially if those strangers are children, it's on the gifter to explain themselves upfront as they are handing the item over.\n\nUsing your story as an example, there was no reason the man couldn't have mentioned he was doing a promotion for the bakery as he handed the cupcake over. (Unless he was at a booth, but then I feel like that would make a clearer connection to a reason than I read from your story.)\n\nLikewise in OP's story, the fact that the man said nothing is what makes it seem sketchy. Not that an explanation obliges anyone to then eat what they are given by a stranger at random of course.\n\nAlso where kids are involved I feel like it's courtesy to check with the parents that it's okay to give them something  before doing so. I'm not a parent myself but I can imagine a few reasons parents might not want their kids taking random food from someone they don't know, beyond the potential sketchiness (or just them wanting to enforce \"don't take candy from strangers\" to a child still young enough to need that) -  the potential for allergies or other food restrictions, for one.\n\nMaybe I'm just a cynic, but I'm with OP here - it's a strange situation and one where he had to reinforce to his daughter that she needs to be careful. Not to a point where she's scared of the world, but so that she knows how to look after herself. Maybe this is a good time for a talk about trusting our gut instincts - in an age appropriate way, of course.", "I was thinking that - it sounds like your wife is one of the rare lucky ones who has never had a bad experience with a stranger.\n\nSounds like you'll need to be the one to warn your daughter about the dangers of life once she gets older.", "It's acceptable on Halloween as part of a cultural celebration. \n\nRemoving the activity from the celebration makes it weird, not the activity itself. \n\nChristmas caroling?
