My granddaughter is 2 and I love spending time with her, but at the same time, it\u2019s also a lot to be a single grandma and take care of a small child again! However, I am happy to have the time with my granddaughter so her mom and husband can go out and have some fun. They don\u2019t do it often, so this isn\u2019t a regular thing, but I also watch my granddaughter regularly throughout the week because they both work and I am retired. I was happy to have my granddaughter for an overnight and we had a great time\u2014we cooked together and did projects and read books. I got her to bed and she didn\u2019t sleep well, so it was a restless night. In the morning, I was looking forward to her parents getting her because I was pretty exhausted. \n\nI didn\u2019t hear from my daughter in the morning, but I figured they would be sleeping in after having fun the night before. No big deal. But still, I kind of wanted a phone call or text to let me know the plan for when my granddaughter would be picked up. Finally, at 3pm, I got a text that they were both extremely hungover, had been partying until the early morning hours, and her husband was too sick to drive and pick up the kid (my daughter doesn\u2019t drive), so they were wondering if my granddaughter could just stay another night. \n\nI hadn\u2019t planned for that scenario and I was a little angry about it because I was worn out and hadn\u2019t planned for another night. I said I would really like them to pick up my granddaughter but it was fine if they were hungover and couldn\u2019t manage. I\u2019d figure it out. I probably wasn\u2019t as nice about it as I could have been because my daughter was like, no we\u2019ll just come and get our kid because I don\u2019t want to deal with you. I don\u2019t even know what that meant. They showed up a couple hours later and my daughter was totally pissed off because I had \u201cgiven her a hard time about keeping my granddaughter another night.\u201d All I said was that I wasn\u2019t prepared to have her an extra night and I wasn\u2019t mad about it, but I was irritated that they hadn\u2019t communicated with me and then made the ask. \n\nNow my daughter is pissed off and I feel guilty as a grandma because I don\u2019t want it to seem like I don't want to spend time with my granddaughter. I love her! She is everything to me! However so is my daughter and now she is mad at me for not taking care of my granddaughter when they were out for one night for some fun and needed extra help for a second night. \n\nAITAH?", "created_utc": 1693395279, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165c6li/aitah_for_not_having_my_granddaughter_stay_longer/", "score": 433, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At this point she really owes you an apology.", "NTA\n\nThey are the parents. It is their job to parent their child even when they're hungover. It sounds like they're taking advantage of you *a lot*. Send a message saying this:\n\n'I found your attitude when you picked up your daughter quite disgraceful. I spend a lot of time caring for your daughter, and I was exhausted having had no time to rest all week. I will not be babysitting for a week while I rest and get my full strength back. In future, we should agree pick up times whenever we schedule babysitting, to avoid this situation happening again. I am very happy to babysit and help where I can as i love you and adore daughter, but I am not available 24/7 with no prior warning or gratitude. If you would prefer to make alternative arrangements, feel free, and I will return to being just grandma instead of what is currently the equivalent of a parttime, unpaid nanny.'\n\nYou may think it's too harsh. I assure you it's not. Your daughter's attitude *is* disgraceful. She needs to be put in her place before your health is damaged by her insistence that you are a third parent to *her* child", "NTA. A little communication and better planning on the parents' part would have gone a long way here.  Maybe they didn't intend to abuse OP's services, but there is certainly a perception that they did.", "NTA, they got drunk, they got home late, they assumed that you would cover their parenting duties. Maybe, just maybe if they texted that they really partied hard you might have given them more leeway, but no they wait until well after the time you expected them to pick up their daughter and expected you to keep her longer so they could get rid of their hangovers. Not how it works as parents.", "NTA, tell your daughter the interest tells her to grow up. You\u2019re kind enough to help during the week and take her for a night.

They knew they had to pick up their kid, and they've acted irresponsibly.\n\n My inlaws (Nana and poppy) will have sleepovers with our daughter since she was about 4 (she is 6 now). It has always been pre-planned collection/drop off, etc. The only time it's ever gone extra is when they had taken her out on the pick-up day, and it was getting late, so they called us to see if they could keep her another night. We would never ever expect them to keep her longer because we decided to get smashed and couldn't care for her.", "Let her stay mad. NTA. I am 60, also a retired granny with 11 grandchildren, and have been working since I was 16. Yep, they thought I was going to be the babysitter. I informed all of them that I  am here to help, not be your convenient sitter. You keep her during the week and graciously keep her overnight, yet your daughter has an attitude because you asked them to pick up their child. She is entitled and ungrateful.", "NTA  You help them out quite a bit and they should appreciate it.  I don't fault you for not wanting her another night.  As much as you love her and spending time with her, she's also a 2 year old and that can be a LOT!  I'm 47 and love to babysit my 3 month old granddaughter.  But man, am I glad when the parents get home lol.  It's tiring.  As parents, you have to decide to either cut off the drinking so you aren't hung over.  Or accept that the next day is going to royally suck as you try to parent a young child while feeling like death.", "NTA, you are not a slave. My mom helped me a lot with my kid at that age so I could work but making her take my kid for the night because I want to get drunk?! Already kinda ah-behavior, especially when grandma is not enthusiastic about idea. And using being hungover as an excuse for not picking up your child is a totally irresponsible ah-behavior, you were reasonably upset with them.", "NTA and don't fret,she'll get over her shitty mood with you as soon as she realises she needs you to babysit again.", "NTA. And now you have learned that going forward for overnight sleepovers always come with a pick up time. I handle like so, I\u2019d love to have her spend the night, she needs to picked up by 10am as I have an appointment", "NTA. Unless you said something unexpectedly harsh, I don't get your daughter's reaction. Maybe the hangover had her extra grumpy or something, but when she sobered up she should have apologized.", "NTA. Your daughter is incredibly fortunate you provide weekly childcare and are still willing to do an occasional overnight. Your daughter sounds incredibly entitled. Don\u2019t let her manipulate you.  I bet she has a history of acting out when she doesn\u2019t get her own way.", "NTA.  Your daughter was unreasonable to expect you to do unplanned child care.  You were very nice to give them that one night, and they totally pushed it to assume you were free/able to do a second night.", "NTA. Holy crap. They got to SLEEP IN, and they didn't contact you until 3? Ridiculous. Asking for another night is also ridiculous. Being upset when you said no is entitled in the extreme.", "NTA, parents can have a night out but still need to be responsible about it.  They are just trying to make you feel bad, so next time, you may give in. Don't allow that.", "Nta they asked for 1 night, not 2.  It was fine for them to ask, fine for you to say no.  They push into ahole behavior when they got pissy bc you said no.", "NTA at all.\n\nYour daughter is taking advantage of you.\n\nYour daughter is an adult. She is extremely fortunate to have you as someone who she trusts to occasionally get solo time with her husband to have fun. That does not mean she and her husband aren\u2019t still responsible for their child. Having overnight care means overnight care. She needs to plan ahead and make sure she is able to take back over when the arranged care ended. She didn\u2019t do that, and is now guilting you over it.", "NTA - Just a 23yo here. From my experience here on reddit. I was misled to believe grandparents love to spend time with the grandkids.

Everything else you said was unnecessary.\n\n\nYou gt what you wanted but now you're worried that you were out of order.

I\u2019m probably your daughters age and there\u2019s a big movement among parents our age that our parent don\u2019t act the same as grandparents that our grandparents did when we were kids. \n\nAnd what I mean by that is that if she spent a lot of time with her grandparents as a child, that is her expectation for you as a grandparent to her child. That could explain the prissiness from your daughter? \n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong and it\u2019s really annoying when people expect you to do things without communicating it with you.

You have many more grandchildren than I do, and to hear you talk about the importance of setting boundaries gives me the confidence to set my own. I truly appreciate it.", "Thank you for understanding!", "You\u2019re so right\u2026 I hate to say, but probably so true.", "Perfect. I will absolutely utilize this tip.", "It is not we don't want to spend time with our grandkids, it is difficult to keep up with a young children at our age. A toddler can run a healthy young adult ragged. At 50+ it is overwhelming when the child is with us for long periods of time.", "You\u2019re right. There needs to be some boundaries. I\u2019m going to work on those. That\u2019s on me.", "Think of it as \u201cdefining boundaries\u201d or \u201cmanaging expectations\u201d rather than having a limitation. You\u2019re an adult with your own life \u2014 your daughter needs to respect that. You can still love your grandchild immensely without being at your daughter\u2019s beck and call.\n\nETA: NTA", "They definitely shouldn\u2019t. My MIL has a very busy life owning and running her own business and she\u2019s just generally very connected with family, going to little cousins sports games and taking relatives to doctors appointments. I know she loves our son (he\u2019s an only child of her only child, it is more like obsession \ud83d\ude02) more than anything on this planet even if she can\u2019t be available every possible second.", "The other side to this is: if you don\u2019t set boundaries now, then you will eventually hit \u201cburn out\u201d and stop wanting to help her in the way that you do now. Probably with very little notice, if you get pushed to the point of frustration. \n\nSo you could see it as helping your daughter to help herself - presumably she doesn\u2019t want to push you to the point where you stop providing free child care during the week. \n\nAnd that will happen eventually, if she keeps pushing for more & more favours, and doesn\u2019t respect your time. \n\nYou deserve to have your time respected. But it\u2019s your job to make that happen, by setting healthy boundaries. \n\nYou also deserve to enjoy your retirement, and find time for the things that you want to do. \n\nIt would be ok if you said to her something along the lines of: I\u2019ve been having a think and I want to have (number of) days for my own stuff each week, which means I will be available for child care (other number) days a week. And I can do 1 overnight per fortnight - you can choose to make that one 2-nights stay per month if that suits you better. For example. \n\nThe advantage of this approach - thinking about what YOU want from your life, and communicating it gently, means that you can give her sufficient warning to put something else in place. Maybe two months\u2019 notice. \n\nThe risk with not doing it, is that she\u2019ll keep asking for more & more (and being annoyed with you for not being her uncomplaining servant!) to the point where you tell her you\u2019ll stop all help, starting tomorrow. Which is a position you\u2019ll both find it hard to recover from.", "I have a 3yr boy who loves his nana(his mom)  but we would never leave her alone past more than she can handle and when coming back we try to get something she needs in her house done while our son stalks hers, she\u2019s in her late 50s and is tiredddddd once it\u2019s time to to and we get it. She is def taking advantage of you and most grandmas spend time when they schedule it not to babysit so mom can go out with dad and party, so no guilt. if you worried about spending time ask to take her when you know they get home from work and the few hours to reset without a toddle afoot would be nice. But over nights at that age are hard on anyone who isn\u2019t the parents who do it. I also have a 13 yr old. 21 with her and 32 with son and those years make a difference.

You\u2019re okay with helping so they can earn a living, but they should figure out something different for extracurriculars on weekends. \n\nThat is okay. \n\nI love my granddaughters to death, but I wouldn\u2019t even sign up for weekday care. If they\u2019re sick, can\u2019t go to daycare or school, absolutely, but I raised mine.

I live 5+ hours away from my parents. Initially, we'd drive all the way up there and back to drop children off. When they got a bit older that changed to meeting halfway and swapping children over to grandparents. Then my dad became ill, so we stayed over for visits. After he passed, had a period of visiting grandma as a family, and now we drive, drop off, and collect, as it's a long drive for my mum on her own but she still wants them to visit.", "If you\u2019re having trouble being direct, you are also allowed to schedule carefully to protect your own space and mind.

Thank you.", "NTA!  My parents (my mom does most of the work) watch my kids overnight on occasion.  My wife and I are always greatful and let them know as much.

I WISH I had this kind of support.  We are no contact with my husband's mother.  My own mother lives 5 minutes away from me and hasn't seen her grandkids for over 2 months now.  She calls me to complain she never gets to see them  and I tell her she has an open invitation to come over whenever she wants and she never does.

I always thanked them profusely!\n\nI would show up at 9am to pick up my kids, hungover or not. That is on your daughter & husband for hitting it too hard. You dont get to stop parenting just because you drank too much last night. You have already gotten a lot of great suggestions of what to say to her, so I wont add to that!", "NTA, your daughter is taking advantage of you. You do daycare for her (guessing for free) during the week and now wants an entire weekend for free.  Good job on shutting her down.   Start to limit the time during the week.

I almost died giving birth and then the day I was set to be released I developed and infection and had to be put on high dose antibiotics and stay an extra night. We had to beg my parents to keep the kids an extra night. Yes it wasn\u2019t planned, and we felt awful, but my husband couldn\u2019t leave me in the hospital. I literally couldn\u2019t move due to the circumstances around my delivery and nurseries are no longer a thing and this was at the beginning of Covid, so I couldn\u2019t even have another person come to help me. And boy did we get an earful and I\u2019m still resentful that there was no concern that I almost bled out. But I\u2019m willing to bet in my case OP wouldn\u2019t have given watching the kiddo a second thought. But almost dying, and just hungover are very different circumstances.", "NTA!!", "NTA. Having her overnight is so they can go out, get back at 1am, sleep, then pick her up by 10 or 11 am.

You don't get to be hungover when you have little kids to take care of. Know the last time I was drunk? Me neither, but it's been YEARS.", "I would disagree with that slightly. I'd say it's fine to be a bit hungover but that doesn't mean you don't still have to look after your children if you haven't prearranged someone else to look after them. \n\nIt might suck, especially if they play with loud toys or something and need a lot of attention meaning you can't just relax and try to recover but that's not anyone else's problem.", "This happened to us once, went to dinner and the nutcracker, got home after the play and both had food poisoning. \n\nWe spent the next day losing weight, and thankfully my inlaws could watch him another day but we stayed in contact with them the entire time to let them know what was going on!", "After several simile experiences with my siblings\u2019 kids, I always get clear plans for pick up and drop off before agreeing. I\u2019ve started making events in my ical w those details and then I share the events w them. I find this just helps everyone, I mean sometimes we forget what we agreed to and this just makes it easy to remember. Also, if I have plans for after the pick up, I do my best to communicate with them so they know I don\u2019t have wiggle room. \n\nbtw, I\u2019m in my 30s, I love these kids and they are great, but it is absolutely exhausting. The lack of communication combined with an expectation that you are just a default babysitter with no life of your own is unacceptable. You\u2019re plenty justified in being miffed and saying as much. It\u2019s basic respect.", "Maybe you\u2019re having a hard time with boundaries because your daughter was very rude to you and behaved like she was entitled to not only treat you like crap, not pick up her daughter as previously arranged, without discussion, and then showed zero gratitude for all your help.

We have this dynamic because I was raised when we have kids. Our parents are grandparents, NOT BABY SITTERS.\n\nWhenever our parents/hubby's grandmother has watched our kids, the pick-up arrangement has always been at lunchtime (once or twice dinner), and we are to stay for the meal, then we go.

It ended up being 6 hours by the time we got home (1hr traveleach way, plus dinner and then the show), but the kids slept for at least half.\n\nMy suggestion is for you to set the rules like we have. Excluding emergencies, YOU state when you want to spend time with grankid, and they can plan dates around you (if something comes up like the comedy show hubby and I wanted to see, they can ask but can not get upset if you say no). I also agree that pick-up times need to be discussed right after the discussion on drop-off times. There is no \"we will call once we are up\". \n\nYou are a grandparent.
