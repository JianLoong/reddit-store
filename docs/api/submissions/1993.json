{"id": 1993, "submission_id": "yrrojm", "title": "AITA for calling my sister selfish for announcing her pregnancy at our parents house?", "selftext": "\n\n\nMy husband and I have been having a long struggle with infertility. We have been getting treated and trying for a baby since 2017. But nothing worked! My husband is understandably devastated as he'd always wanted kids but never got the chance to be a father.\n\n\nHe's super sensitive aroubd the infertility topic. This my family knows. Days ago, we got together with family for dinner. All of a sudden, my sister and her husband announced that they were expecting. We were stunned, me and my husband I mean. As for the others they were thrilled. As everyone got up to congratulate them. My husband got up, pushed his chair to the side and walked out. They all stared at me but I got up and told my sister she messed up by announcing her pregnancy like this and with 0 consideration for my husband knowing how he feels about this topic. She got defensive saying his \"issues\" with the topic wasn't her problem and that she and her husband were fed up walking on eggshells around him. I called her selfish and cruel but she complained that he ruined their joy and that I made it worse by making a scene. I told her she shoukdn't have chose my parents house but she said I have no place to dictate what she does in our parents house. My mom asked me to go home and I went.\n\n\nIt's been horrible. My parents think I've reacted poorly and should apologize to my sister on both mine and my husband's behalf after the scene we made at their home.", "created_utc": 1668114015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrrojm/aita_for_calling_my_sister_selfish_for_announcing/", "score": 638, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unfortunate situation but where else is your sister supposed to announce that she's pregnant?  Or is she supposed to keep it a secret?", "YTA\nShe is pregnant. What else should she do than to tell everybody and be happy about it?\n\nYou are allowed to be sad about your unfulfilled wish for children. It's also ok to not be as happy as everybody else about the announcement. But in a private moment you should apologize to you sister and tell her that you are happy for her. That you wish her all the best and the bad emotions are not about her pregnancy but about your unfulfilled childwish. \n\nAnd I am realistic: In case you won't get any own children, you will be happy for every niece and nephew. \n\nI wish you all the best. That you can practice with the kid of your sister and will have a lovely relationship to it. And that you soon are allowed to hold your own kid in your arms.", "YTA and sister is right, you cannot expect everyone to walk on eggshells around you and your husband. I kind of see where this is heading too, she is supposed not to come to family dinners by the time her belly shows out of \"consideration\" or smth like this. Sorry but this is something you have to learn to deal with, you cannot expect people to accommodate you to the point they cannot speak about their pregnancy (eg announce it)", "YTA. Were they just supposed to never tell you guys? How is SHE the selfish one here?", "YTA. You can't be happy for your sibling? You and your husband acted selfishly and should apologize.", "YTA. I understand that it\u2019s hard for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean nobody else should have kids because you can\u2019t. Stop being so entitled.", "YTA.\nOther people are allowed to be happy.  \nYour fertility issues aren't anyone else's problem. Your sister probably thought it was good news and wanted to share with her whole family.\n\nHow selfish of your husband and you to make it about you.", "YTA - this is a private family dinner at your parents house with your family and your sisters family.  When else is she supposed to announce her news?  It wasn't a wedding, or any type of public event, you've got no cause to be angry.  \n\nI understand that you and your husband are having difficulty conceiving, and I sympathize, however the rest of the world is continuing to move forward.  I know that's harsh for you to hear, but you have to thicken up your skin.  This wasn't about you or your husband - it was about your sister and you totally ruined her exciting news.", "YTA\n\nYour parents are right. You should apologize. The world doesn't tiptoe around your infertility problems. It's a cruel fact, believe me but you can't expect everyone to muffle their celebrations and happiness just to accommodate for your struggles. If this were a new struggle, perhaps but it doesn't seem to be.\n\nThe cruelest thing about life is that it continues on no matter how hurtful.", "YTA simple. Others shouldn't hide their happiness because you and your husband have it difficult. Your sister and her husband have every right to express and share their happiness with others.", "YTA. What exactly would you consider an appropriate way for her to announce her pregnancy? Or did you expect her to keep it a secret until the child was born, until it was old enough to graduate, for the rest of their lives?", "YTA - I guess there world should stop and no one should announce any happy news, because you can't conceive. You're but a tiny speck in the universe, get over yourself.", "YTA in this and you really should apologize. It's not your place to dictate how she tells the family she's expecting. It's appropriate at a family dinner. It's not appropriate at a wedding, which this wasn't. I'm sorry for the struggles you are facing but your sister really didn't do anything wrong. Your parents are right that you handled this poorly.\n\nEdit to add: Maybe consider therapy and getting some grief counseling? I think it would be beneficial for the both of you so you are better prepared for these types of situations and can handle them more gracefully.", "Yta. Sorry about ur issues but people dont have to stop their lives over you. Do u believe in life there we be no child bc u cant have there. Ivf or adoption. Dont rain on their parade. Again im sorry", "YTA\n\nYou took your brother in law and sister's joyous announcement and made it about you and your husband's problems.\n\nEveryone has been tiptoeing around your fertility issues for 5 years. And you couldn't let them have 5.minutes if excitement. \n\nBefore you say something like, \"no one understands,\" my husband and I had miscarriage after miscarriage until we decided to live our lives, happily, child free. And yes, we're happy for our friends who announce their pregnancies.", "YTA. I get it. The anniversary of the miscarriage of my only pregnancy is approaching. Infertility is a bigger struggle than people who have not dealt with realized but life doesn't stop for everyone because of what you and your husband are going through. Your sister should not be denied the chance to share her happiness at her parents home.", "YTA be happy for your sister Jesus shes allowed to tell family she's pregnant", "YTA. Infertility is heartbreaking and difficult, but you and your husband were very out of line. You both owe everyone an apology for how you acted. \n\nMore importantly, though, you and your husband should strongly consider grief counseling. The grief that comes from wanting to be a parent and having problems conceiving is all-consuming and not treating the grief will create lots of problems and extra suffering for you. It's already straining your familial relationships. You are about to get a new addition to the family and addressing your grief now, with a professional's help, will go a long way to allowing your relationships to survive and will also allow you to be present and engaged in your new nibling's life.", "YTA\n\nI am sorry for your infertility issues. However, you don't get to take happiness away from other people because of it. \n\nWhere were they supposed to announce the pregnancy? Or were they just supposed to keep it a secret? And what happens when the baby shows up? Will them bringing the baby around be \"rubbing it in your face\" too?", "YTA \n\nNot your house, not your rules\n\nYour mother was correct to ask you to leave after causing a scene", "YTA your sister should not be expected to not be excited about her pregnancy because of your husband. \n\nWhile his feelings are valid, if he is struggling this bad then he needs to seek therapy.", "YTA\n\nThe degree of control that you are trying to exercise over your family members is grossly inappropriate.  I don't know how far you expect to be able to take this.  If you are all on Facebook, is she not allowed to post an announcement because your husband might see it?  Is she not allowed to tell any common acquaintances because they might share the news? \n\nAt some point your husband needs to recognize that it's not all about him.", "YTA unfortunately life goes on and part of that is friends and family having children. As heartbreaking as your situation is your sister has every right to announce her pregnancy at a family dinner as long as it wasn\u2019t a special occasion for someone else.\n\nYou and your husband reacted poorly. I am sure your sister, bil and your parents have been supportive of your struggles. You need to be supportive with your sisters good news. Truthfully no matter how or when she announced her pregnancy you or your husband would have reacted poorly. It\u2019s not fair for you or him to expect them not to have children or be happy when they do.\n\nI would suggest you and your husband go to counseling before it ruins your relationship with your friends and family. And you do owe your sister an apology and so does your husband.", "yta \ud83e\udee4 sorry, if you were at your own house or it was an event about one or both of you two, then it's a dick move on your sister's part, but it was just a family dinner. it is rough, I understand, but your sister is right that she has the right to share news as she's part of the family and that was a family dinner.", "YTA \u2014 your struggles are not your sisters struggles. If the roles were reversed would you have stayed childless for her sake?", "Very much YTA\n\nThis is not about you or your husband. Your sister is also her HER parents' house and wanted to share their good news. They don't owe you anything and it's unfair or you or your husband to expect to lessen themselves because of your struggles. They have every right to be excited and share that with the family.", "YTA\n\nI understand the sensitivity about the topic, but you shouldn't expect other people to hide their blessings. From the lack of context, I'm sure you're sister did not mean it out of spite, but saw the perfect moment to share the news with the most important people in her life. You and your husband took that moment away from her when you made it about yourselves, rather than congratulating her and dealing with your emotions separately.\n\nI do wish you both the best and hope you can one day start a family- be it through surrogacy or adoption.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\nSomeone with a shit ton of health problems, a low chance of ever carrying children, watching everyone else around her start a family.", "YTA\n\nThe reactions of you and your husband were uncalled for, yes your sister was extremely rude in her response. But, would she have had that kind of response if not for yalls reactions?\n\nI mean is all the happiness of her family supposed to stop, because of yalls unfortunate struggles?", "Yta\nLook.  I get it. \nI've wanted to be a mom since I was 15.\nI've even been pregnant but wasn't in a safe place to keep my baby. \nMy fiance died and I was alone for 8 years\n8 years of wishing is had kids sooner and worrying that I never will. \nI still don't have kids and I don't know if I still can or if I ever will and I try not to think about it because it breaks my heart. \nAnd I see my friends and family having kids that I don't have and I know how much it hurts. \n\nYou and your husband have every reason to be upset.  \nI can even get behind your husband walking out for his own well being and probably because he didn't want to ruin your sister's happy news by breaking down and leaving seemed like the better option. \n\nBut you.... you are an AH for berating your sister for sharing her happy news with her family. \nThe appropriate thing to do, if you can't politely congratulate them,  is to apologize that this is difficult for you and your husband and excuse yourself.", "YTA. Everything in your extended family doesn't revolve around you. Why shouldn't you be happy for your sister just like everyone else was? You do owe your sister an apology - though your husband owes a bigger one. He needs to cope with his own disappointment and not expect the rest of the world to do it for him.", "YTA. It is pretty bad that you and your partner can't conceive, but that's not a reason for people to avoid being happy whenever and wherever they want. \nSad, but you both need to deal with it before that problem becomes worse and bitter.", "YTA. I feel even if you sister had a special dinner with just your parents, or with all the family without you and your husband in attendance, you would still feel angry that your sister and her husband are pregnant. Your post would be about having to hear that your sister is pregnant from other family members. \n\nI think both you and your husband need to talk through this and possibly get some therapy because the way you have treated your sister so far is horrible and she will likely not tell you anything regarding her family in the future. You won't get the updates about her child like the rest of the family.", "YTA because you are having fertility issues doesn't mean others are not allowed to be happy about their pregnancies. You and your husband need to get a grip and get over yourselves. The two of you are not the center of your family's universe.", "YTA. I do think it\u2019s shitty of your sister not to give you a head\u2019s up, but babies will be born whether you have kids or don\u2019t.\n\nIt isn\u2019t about you.", "YTA\n\nThey chose the right place and time to announce it.  Your husbands emotional hang ups on it are his responsibility, not your sisters.  I get that it sucks not being a dad, especially if you want to be one.  But that doesn't mean other people have to walk on eggshells for you or your husband.  You both live in a world where most people will have children.  You two have to learn how to cope with that fact without calling others selfish.", "Gently, YTA and your husband is too.   \nIf this happened at your home, I would have a harder time with my judgement... but this was your parent's home. This was your parents child letting them know they were going to be grandparents. \n\nYou and your husband are the ones that acted selfishly. Your fertility struggles do not mean no one else in your family can have children you know...", "YTA. I understand it\u2019s an extremely difficult thing you are going through, it doesn\u2019t make you entitled to stop other people sharing their good news. You and your husband need to deal with your feelings attached to the topic because it\u2019s not fair that everyone else should have to walk on eggshells because of your own issues. Many people have issues with fertility but it does not mean  they have the right to take others joyous moments away from them.", "YTA. I understand that this is a sensitive topic for you and your husband. However, the world continues to turn. It is not okay to ruin someone else's joy for your misery. She's allowed to be happy that she's pregnant. You are allowed to be sad that you're not, and your husband is allowed to be sad. You are not allowed to demand people walk on eggshells around you. Your boundaries are for YOU.\n\nSo not going to a baby shower? Yeah, that makes sense. Not baby sitting? Also makes sense. Demanding that no one talk about babies or be happy that they're pregnant? Not okay.", "YTA. I\u2019m genuinely sorry to hear you are struggling with this, but you can\u2019t expect other people to walk on egg shells and hide their joy because you can\u2019t have something they do. Are you going to be upset seeing updates on social media? Will you be upset seeing her in person once she begins to show? Or pics after the baby is born? Or her bringing the baby to family events? You can\u2019t expect people to hide themselves away to spare your feelings. I get how terrible it must feel to see someone have what you so desperately want, but it is not fair to take out your feelings on other people like this. They did nothing wrong by sharing this news with their own family. If you and your husband are struggling this much I think you should look into therapy. Best of luck!\n\nEdited to add- here are a few aita stories from more of your sisters perspective.

You're not the centre of the universe.", "Hypothetically if you and your husband were to fall pregnant and announce it to your family, would you want your family to be happy and congratulate you or storm out of the room and make it about themselves?

I myself am struggling to conceive (not far off giving up), but my nephew is the light of my life, and I will give that child everything I have. Fix your attitude before it\u2019s too late.", "YTA \n\nShe didn\u2019t announce it at a wedding or a birthday party, she announced it at her parents house in front of family.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have to hide it and she\u2019s entitled to feel joy and share her news. It\u2019s a shame that you and your husband spoiled that for her.", "YTA. Sorry about the fertility issues, but your sister is allowed to celebrate her pregnancy and share the news with family. You and your husband are being ridiculous, what are you even mad about?", "Yta. My partner and I had fertility issues. I would not care and have not cared when people have announced their pregnancy. Why is it all about you and your husband? \n\nIf you and your husband got divorced, should people keep quiet about their engagements, because of your struggles during marriage?\n\nFertility issues suck, but nobody should cater to you and your husband. It is in no way insensitive to announce a pregnancy.", "Look I\u2019m going to say this gently but YTA. \n\nI get it infertility SUCKS. My husband and I have been trying for over 6 years now. But my solution for announcements from family? Ask to be told via text first. Before any big announcement. That\u2019s how I approached it with my SIL explained I would be sad for myself but thrilled for them and would just need some private time to grieve on my own. (That plus finally getting back on zoloft for depression and anxiety really helped me not lose my shit) \n\nJust because you\u2019re hurting doesn\u2019t mean you can lash out on your sister. You need to take proactive steps for future announcements from family and friends and both you and your husband need to be in therapy to address your grief and healthy ways to cope.", "YTA your personal problems as adults do not trump other adults' rights to celebrate, announce or share their own excitement.  It wasn't like they upstaged your wedding.  I'm sorry for your troubles but y'all are the selfish ones here and how those troubles keep you from being happy for others.", "YTA  \n \nI have a great deal of sympathy for you and your husband struggling to conceive. It can be devastating and I wouldn\u2019t wish that struggle on anyone. I hope you\u2019re both seeking mental health care to help you navigate your journey. \n\nWith that said, your sister and her husband announcing their pregnancy was not about you. It was about them. And they\u2019re allowed to celebrate it. I think your husband removing himself from the room was the right move for him in the moment but you had no right to call out your sister like that. She\u2019s right that it\u2019s not fair to them to have to walk on eggshells. \n\nYou did react poorly. Now it\u2019s up to you to try to mend fences. And I think part of that mending needs to include a plan for how to navigate pregnancy and babies going forward. What will happen once the baby is born? Or if they have another child? You need answers to those questions because this kid is gonna be sticking around and it would be extremely unfair to everyone to behave as though the child is anything other than a blessing.", "A major YTA and you know it", "Yta. What was the alternative just show up with a baby one day? It\u2019s not all about you", "YTA.  Your sister and her husband are entitled to their joy and happiness.  Your husband and you both acted like children throwing a tantrum.", " YTA I know you are struggling but to tell someone they can\u2019t make an announcement. You guys need therapy that is just crazy. The happiest time for her but sounds like you will not allow her to enjoy", "YTA. Y'all need to figure a way to deal with your infertility that isn't causing everyone around you issues. Hubby definitely needs therapy if it's that bad. And yes you both caused a scene.", "Yta don\u2019t blow out others candles just shine brighter. Your sister wanted to celebrate something wonderful, you and your husband ruined that. Please get therapy.", "YTA and y'all DID ruin her joy. You guys have infertility issues so now NOBODY is allowed to be pregnant? Please.", "YTA. Life doesn\u2019t revolve around you, your sister is allowed to be happy and to share that with her family.", "YTA Where else but a family gathering, that isn't focused around something else (ie wedding), is more appropriate to announce?", "YTA, and your husband too.\n\nIt's understandable that this is a sore topic for him and for you. But your sister is right about the fact that everyone else can't be walking on eggshells around you and your husband so as to not upset you. Life goes on.\n\nAnd your husband was out of line for essentially throwing a tantrum. If this is such a big issue for him, then it's something that he needs to seek professional help with in the form of therapy.", "YTA. \n\nWhen we announced our pregnancy to my brother in law and his wife, the wife burst into tears and went on a long angry rant about their infertility and fairness. I get infertility is hard and upsetting, but the world does not revolve around you and your husband. \n\nYOUR HUSBAND ruined your sisters happy moment. He is TA. And YTA.", "Yta....sorry i get people in your situation have feelings but you all need to stop acting out at others for being able to conceive and sharing their good news. People will not.be putting all their announcements on hold because of others issues. Stop making your problems others problems to consider it isn't right.\n\nEta....you can't tell someone what to announce in someone else's home either", "YTA - it's awful you have infertility issues, but your issues shouldn't pull down someone else's joy. You have to separate your issues and other people's happiness. They announced it at a family get together. To the whole family. To people they wanted to share the joy with. You should've apologized on your husband's behalf, congratulated your sister, been excited to be an aunt, and then consoled your husband. Are you going to get mad at everyone who has a baby? Be realistic.", "YTA.  Not for being upset, but for the way you and your husband handled it.  Now you both owe your sister and your parents an apology for acting like children.  You both also need to decide if you can act like decent humans around your sister and her eventual child from here on out or if that relationship is essentially over because she dared to get pregnant.", "YTA. Just because you're lost something doesn't mean other people shouldn't celebrate what they've gained.", "YTA. I am you. We are not able to have kids and it has been a struggle. It is OUR struggle. I would NEVER want anyone to lessen their joy because of my infertility.  My sister announced  her first pregnancy Christmas  eve and you better believe I was thrilled and heart broken. But I waited till we were in the car on our way home to cry. Your sister has every right to announce  her pregnancy to her family. It is up to you and your husband to deal with those feelings in an adult manner. What do you expect her to do? Show up one day with a baby? Both you and your husband need to get I to therapy  to deal with these feelings.", "YTA, I get that infertility is hard, really hard. BUT, you can't expect to not have others get pregnant around you ever.  That's not fair to anyone else.  When would you expect her to announce?  I mean, it sounds like the whole nuclear family was at dinner so perfect timing.", "YTA and so is your husband.\n\nSorry this is happening to you guys but the world keeps spinning and your sister has every right and absolutely should announce her pregnancy at your parents house. Your husband needs to figure something out because he can't throw temper tantrums every time someone he knows gets pregnant", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry you all are dealing with infertility, but your sister is right. She doesn't have to not announce her pregnancy at BOTH OF YOUR PARENTS homes. They are her parents too. You and your husband need to be in therapy if you can't handle others being pregnant. \n\nThere are also plenty of other ways to have children in this day and age.", "Kindly, YTA. While I understand it must be very hard to deal with infertility... the world doesn't stop spinning because of it. Your sister is allowed to get pregnant and to be happy about it. You are the selfish one if you think she shouldn't talk/announce it/enjoy it, and you are selfish if you think she should handle her pregnancy and anything related to it differently because of your struggle. She shouldn't have to live in your shadow.", "YTA. I'm very sorry for you and your husband's situation, but you can't expect everyone around you to censor their joy at pregnancies. Your sister has the right to be excited and happy, and to share it with the family. Are you going to swear off all family events if her child, or children, attends? You need to find healthy ways to process your situation rather than being angry at others.", "YTA- Your and your husband's fertility issues are tough, devastating and I understand that it is hard. Any feelings of jealously, sadness, etc. are completely valid. The **behavior** of expecting your sister and family to walk on eggshells around you guys is not. Your sister is allowed to have her joy and happiness. Would it have been nice if she gave you a heads up? Yes. Is it required? No. \n\nPerhaps you and your husband need to see a mental health professional if you aren't already.", "There is no ESH here. YTA, plain and simple. It is not your sister's fault that you two were unable to have children. She shouldn't have to decide how she announced her pregnancy around you and your husband's feelings. This is a time of joy for her. \n\nGet help for your husband and apologise. Otherwise you face a very real risk of having zero relationship with any nephews and nieces. Your sister will easily think if they can't cope with hearing the word pregnant how will they cope seeing a baby/toddler/child etc.", "YTA. Whose house should she have announced it in? Infertility sucks, but the world around you is not going to stop because of it. She didn't get pregnant at you and your husband. You were the ones who made her pregnancy about you and probably ruined something that was an important moment to her. You do owe her an apology. This should be a wake up call that you and your husband need to be in therapy to learn to manage your emotions around infertility. Others are going to have babies. It's going to hurt you. But you hurting them isn't going to change anything for you.", "YTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to Rob other people of joy just because you are grieving. \n\nYou and your husband were inconsiderate and selfish.", "Awww honey. I'm glad you're sensitive to your hubby's needs but you are def TA here.  \n\n\nFamily get togethers are where family members share stuff. Was she supposed to just hide the pregnancy, the baby?   \n\n\nYou and your husband now have two choices: Learn how to be adults who are going through something hard OR lose your sister and her family and maybe your parents bc there is going to be showers and the birth and first steps and birthdays and the first grandbaby stuff at holidays. This is what life is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suggest you guys sit down and together figure out how you're going to behave moving foward that isn't joy-sucking, event-ruining for everyone else  \n\n\nI'm sorry you are going through this, but your struggles do not negate other people's lives", "YTA. For all reasons given above: life goes on. Will he refuse to see the child once it is born, should they just hide it until it is old enough? There are many ways in becoming. Have you considered an adoption? In any case, maybe you both need to have counselling.", "YTA\n\nI get that it comes from a place of hurt but it's not about you or your husband. You definitely owe them an apology.", "YTA.\n\nI get it. You and your husband have had infertility struggles and that's awful and I'm so sorry.\n\nBut it's also pretty awful to project that pain onto other people, especially at places and times where the conversation was not about you or your infertility struggles. Your sister has nothing to do with the pain you've gone through and she was just hoping you'd be happy for her. Will you be getting upset at somebody every time anybody brings up babies around you?\n\nAnd it's TOTALLY OK if you aren't ready to be happy for her because of the pain you've gone through, but your feelings are absolutely not her fault. I think there could've been a more tactful way to let her know that you'd like to be happy for her, but that it might take time because of the pain you've endured.", "YTA\nI feel for you, but you and your husband are overstepping from hurt in to selfish territory.

It's not only your parent's house, it's also HER parents' house, of course she'd want to share that with her parents who are soon to be grandparents. It's unfortunate that the two of you are infertile, but that doesn't mean that she can't share important life-changing news with her family.

Wtf dude. Come on. \nYou can be sad and jealous, but angry is totally misplaced.

You owe your parents and your sister and her husband both apologies.", "YTA, the entitlement is unbelievable!! People can't have babies? And people  cant be happy about having a baby around your husband because you're infertile?! What the heck?! You did ruin her joy and announcement Dude!! The world can't tippy toe around your husband's feelings.  \n\nSo when you get pregnant will you be happy and announce it at your parents?? Does she get her moments back when you're expecting?? No!!

But...\nYTA on this.  Your sister is right, you can't dictate what she says at your parents and this was something to be shared and not talked about in hushed voices. \n\nYou should be happy for her regardless of your struggles and maybe even more happy than others because you know the struggles that can happen.\n\nIt would have been nice if she told you and your husband in private before breaking it publicly.", "GUYS STOP COMMENTING YTA I CANT LIKE COMMENTS FASTER", "YTA.

Your husband needs therapy badly because even if you manage to have a kid he's going to damage it with the baggage he's collecting along the way.", "Gentle YTA. Why shouldn't she announce it? So they have to pretend and minimize their joy so as not to upset you? That's not fair. Where is she supposed to announce it? Are you also going to expect them to never bring the baby around you?", "These one's are always tough for me for personal reasons.  \n\n\nI think in this situation, sadly, it's a YTA. Announcing a pregnancy at their parent's house is... pretty standard. Like you can't expect everyone around you to just never talk about babies. It sucks but there it is. If this were at an event like your wedding or your birthday or something like that then that changes things but this sounds like a random dinner. It sucks, but they can't just never talk/celebrate their kiddo ever.

We don't have infertility issues (that we know of), we just don't have all the required parts (she's a woman and I'm AFAB), so we have to take the long way around which, as anyone who has been through this process knows, can take for actual ever. In the meantime, people announce their pregnancies on Facebook, in person, her sister even had her *second* baby.

Your sister could have handled this differently. ideally, spoken to you and your husband ahead of time so that you wouldn't be blind sided but she is also entitled to joy and to announce her pregnancy how she wants. The weekend before my very first IVF transfer, after years of infertility and quite a few false starts, my little sister announced her pregnancy. Mind you, at the time she wasn't in a relationship (my niece is basically the product of a one night stand) had no job and was 30 living completely off my parents. She is now a great mom and i love my niece to pieces but at the time she was a complete effing screw up.  even still--her pregnancy was NOT ABOUT ME. infertility is not an excuse to behave the way you behaved. also you and your husband need to work on how you're going to handle pregnancy announcements. because at around your stage of life you're in for A LOT of them coming at you from every angle.", "YTA and your behavior gives those struggling with infertility a bad name.

She did eventually have a child, but because of what she did we don\u2019t have a relationship with her or that nephew. Your narrow minded selfishness is going to cost you your family.

The hopelessness and relationship impacts are unimaginable, and this goes without saying. \n\nHowever. This is your situation. Your family feels for you, I'm sure of it. You cannot expect them to taper their own wants or excitement in solidarity with your infertility struggles. It is unfair to ask this of them. \n\nHad the shoe been on the other foot I feel you'd hope that your family would be happy for you despite their own personal struggles, and not rain on your parades during such a happy moment that should be filled with family togetherness, closeness and excitement. \n\nYour sister is not selfish for becoming pregnant. You are not selfish for feeling \"left out\" of the club. Everyone has a right to an independent thought process here, which is completely fair. But blurring the lines between the two because you're feeling left out due to your own personal struggles, isn't fair or a reason to treat your sister this way.", "YTA.\nIs everyone supposed to \n1. Hide their pregnancies around you and your husband forever?\n2. Just never get pregnant because, well, if you can't have a baby, nobody should?\n\nIt's unfortunate that you aren't able to get pregnant. It is. But that doesn't mean other people can't be excited for their own babies. You have options. He wants to be a father, try to adopt if you can't get pregnant.", "YTA. Your infertility issues are your own and you can\u2019t expect other people to put their lives on hold or tiptoe around you.

I had to smile while seemingly everyone around me was announcing their pregnancies. I went to baby showers and birthday parties. I watched all the Snapchat videos and Liked all the baby posts. My heart was in ruins the entire time. Still, I never let my hurt ruin the joy of others. I talked about my pain at appropriate times and received the comfort and support that I needed. It\u2019s possible to be sad and still celebrate for others. Life doesn\u2019t stop and expecting others to cater to your feelings at the expense of their own is really selfish.", "YTA. As someone who has to deal with fertility issues, I understand how hard it is. However, my difficulty staying pregnant in no way diminished my joy for my family and friends who were pregnant or who had kids. It's selfish to expect otherwise. I do have a daughter, so I was able to have \"my turn\" after losing 2 pregnancies. (One was twins) Expecting everyone else to walk on eggshells around you or or put their lives on hold is selfish. Your sister should get to share her news and celebrate her pregnancy with her family without being made to feel like crap.", "YTA. Not having kids rules. Lean into it, go on cool vacations.

I know this is hard on you and your husband, but you don\u2019t get to make it everyone else\u2019s problem.

Her joy doesn't rob you of yours.", "YTA\n\nIt would have been nice,\u00a0and emotionally aware, if your sister had let you know discreetly ahead of time that she was going to share this news and given you some time to process it on your own. But not doing that does not make her an asshole. \n\nI know that it's painful for both you and your husband to hear news like this. More importantly, though, *you* both know that it's painful for you, and you need to figure out a better strategy for dealing with other people's pregnancy news than expecting them not to share it in front of you. That might be a few sessions with a therapist, or it might just be accepting that managing your emotions is your responsibility, not everyone else's. \n\nIt's completely OK for you to feel sad about this news \u2014 or happy, or a complicated mix of various good and bad emotions. Having the emotions is not the problem and not what makes you the asshole. How you deal with your emotions, and using them to justify being jackasses to other people, is what does it. \n\nYou should apologize, and more importantly you should get the help you need to deal with your grief and sadness in a way that won't damage the other relationships in your life.", "Super gentle yta from a fellow infertile couple.

That is especially true around immediate family! \n\nMy sil just got pregnant with their 2nd and while it totally gutted my spouse and I, we would never try and steal their joy, or be angry with them for sharing their lives with their family. After we shared in their joy we took a moment together at home to feel our feelings. Your husband excusing himself to me is okay, but being angry at them is not. I\u2019m sorry you and your husband are going through this! It\u2019s super tough!!! However it\u2019s not okay to do what you did.

You and your husband both need therapy.", "YTA.\nSo the rule is cause you and your husband are going through something hard. That means no joy or baby news for anyone else. No one gets to make big announcements cause it might trigger you or your husband.  Why are your feelings more valid than others? Why do you get to control how others act or what the right time is. You swallow the pain and congratulate your sister.  Then, open up the pain when you come home. Grief over it and pray you get your chance. You do not stomp on their joy cause they did not go about it like you wanted\n And yes, I know the pain of peeing on that stick and getting nothing again and again.

But the sister didn't have to announce it right there and then in front of everyone, with the husband (and OP) , sitting RIGHT THERE. Wouldn't it have been kinder to wait and tell them another time? Doing that wouldn't change anything, they would still be expecting and everyone would still be able to enjoy it. Yes, that would probably still hurt at other times, but at least OP and her husband would know that they *tried* to consider his feelings. This way it's like they don't actually give a shit and it's all about them.\n\nLook at it this way, if OP had recently had a baby that died, would they still think it was ok to announce it? Or would they, more likely, have a bit of compassion and tell the parents in private, and then maybe tell OP in private too so it could be done more sensitively. I'm sure most commenters would agree to NTA in that situation. So what you're all (and the family) are basically saying, is that infertility struggles are no big deal and they should just get over it? That, to me, is pretty selfish and hurtful.", "I'm gonna say NTA. Your sister sprung this on you and that's unfair. She could've given you a heads up privately, that's the etiquette in situations like this. Then you could've either excused yourself from the moment she told your parents or at least prepared yourself and your husband. Did you and your husband react badly? Sure.

They all stared at me but I got up and told my sister she messed up by announcing her pregnancy like this and with 0 consideration for my husband knowing how he feels about this topic. She got defensive saying his \"issues\" with the topic wasn't her problem and that she and her husband were fed up walking on eggshells around him. I called her selfish and cruel but she complained that he ruined their joy and that I made it worse by making a scene. I told her she shoukdn't have chose my parents house but she said I have no place to dictate what she does in our parents house. My mom asked me to go home and I went.\n\n\nIt's been horrible.

Be happy for the success of other people.", "YTA, i'm so sorry about your situation and that's a really terrible thing to go through but your sister and her husband shouldn't be made to feel bad or shamed because they are having a baby when you are struggling. She was sharing some good news with her family and even though it's hard for you, you can't expect her to tiptoe around you.", "You can\u2019t police everyone and their own fertility when you are struggling. Maybe she should have given you a heads up but she didn\u2019t.", "YTA\n\nI'm very sorry for yours and your husband's pain, but this wasn't about either of you. Are you so selfish that you can't be happy for your own sister?", "Apologize. Its not their fault you guys cant have kids and no one should put their life on hold for you. Im sorry you guys cant have children, but what is everyone else supposed to do?", "Yta. Your infertility struggles have nothing to do with your sister. How else were they supposed to announce it?", "YTA and your husband is TA. I\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through. Doesn\u2019t mean your sister should stop living her own life. She should be able to share her pregnancy and joy with loved ones without you and your husband making it all about yourselves.", "YTA. Your fertility problems are not your sister\u2019s problems. Be adults, you don\u2019t seem mature enough to have kids anyways.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having fertility issues and unsuccessful getting pregnant, but that\u2019s no excuse to rain on other people\u2019s parade.  What was she supposed to do? Hide it?  Act nonchalant about it? It is exiting for her and those who love her and while it may sting for you, surely you don\u2019t want her to be sad or afraid to discuss this huge thing.", "**YTA**. Why are you and your husband so selfish that you thought your parents would not and should not be able to hear that they have a grandchild on the way just because you were present? Do you think they are not allowed to be happy about that because you and your husband have fertility issues? Are you genuinely incapable of being happy for your sister and her husband because of your situation?\n\nI get that not being able to have children is hard and that you deserve empathy for your situation. However, I don't get this expectation that it makes pregnancy news a forbidden subject just because you happen to be in the vicinity. You are asking too much.", "YTA \nI genuinely feel for you, the struggle is painful and emotionally difficult. So apologize to your sister. \n\nShe chose the normal, natural place to announce her pregnancy. This is a life altering event, and there's no way to keep it a secret. Your husband's feelings were going to be hurt one way or another, probably more so if she started to show and didn't tell you. \n\nApologize to your sister, that the struggle has taken its mental toll and you don't want to lose a good relationship over forces no one can truly control.", "YTA\n\nIf they're going to be in your life, you're going to find out somehow. You were within your right to walk out and recover, but you had no right to berate her for announcing her news to the family.\n\nYour husband can't let his trauma become everybody else's if he wants a good relationship with a growing family.", "YTA. Your sister is right here. Sorry this is happening to you and your husband but people shouldn't have to walk on eggshells or not share their hapiness because of your issues.", "YTA and you and your husband need therapy. Does everyone have to walk on eggshells with him or what? You're being selfish by not allowing others be happy for their pregnancy news, sorry you guys can't have a baby but no one needs to cater to you because you haven't processed your grief. Get help to process this and understand you both would've gotten mad when you would see her showing her belly anyways.", "First of all, I'm so sorry - the struggle of infertility is truly devastating and no one who hasn't been through it can relate. That being said, I'm veering on a very gentle Y T A, maybe even ESH.   \n\n\nY T A - because despite the pain you and your husband have and clearly are still suffering, your sister shouldn't have to downplay or hide a significant moment in her life because of that, and, announcing a pregnancy in your family home is completely normal. YNTA for feeling the way that you do (same for your husband) *but* your reaction is in A territory. \n\non the E S H side, knowing the pain/history you and your husband have around this topic, I think the kind and gracious thing for your sister to do would have been to call you and your husband and give you the heads up on this so that you were prepared for the announcement.   \n\n\nAgain, i'm sorry this is what you're going through - its devastating. But, you can't expect those around you to hide significant things in their life because of that. It's sad, and at times maybe even feels unfair, but, it's true.   \n\n\nI hope you and your husband can come to a feeling of peace around this.", "YTA. \n\nAs someone who has experienced a loss, I understand how difficult pregnancy announcements are, but after this length of time your sister wasn\u2019t being unreasonable by telling her close family in the way she did.\n\nA friend of mine fell pregnant months after my loss, and although it hurt when she told me, I didn\u2019t react like this and was happy for her, alongside my pain. After the period of time that had passed for you, it\u2019s not unreasonable at all that your sister acted the way she did.", "YTA you can not dictate when and where your sister announces her pregnancy, while yes it may have been nice to get a heads up about it before the main announcement you are not entitled to it. She is not responsible for what upset you or your husband. Asking for other to tip toe around the topic of pregnancy is not fair thing of you to expect from others. The announcement was her and her partners moment to enjoy, your parents moment to enjoy knowing they'll be grandparents while it may have upset you and your partner you could have congratulated her at the very least before leaving to comfort your husband. \nDid you expect her to put her life on hold while you try for a baby? Did you want her to wait on the announcement till the baby was born or the bump was noticeable for others to find out? It sounds as though no matter when it would have been announced your husband would still have been upset about it and you would've caused an unnecessary scene.", "YTA. Your sister is correct, your husbands issues are not her problem. Maybe you both should talk to someone to work out the emotional stuff. but it is not fair for you to expect your sister to NOT be able to announce her incoming baby to the family. They are HER parents and family, too.", "YTA. This is your sister's blessing and you two are trying to make it about yourself. Being unable to have children is a personal issue for you and your husband to weigh your options on. The entire world is not obligated to be on pause for you to have a baby.", "YTA. Other people don't have to stop living their lives because of your unfortunate circumstances.  She had every right to announce good news to her whole family at once. While terrible, your misfortune shouldn't change how others act around you. Does your husband run away from every child you see in public? There is absolutely no way that you can avoid dealing with this issue. But it is YOUR issue to deal with. Yours and your husband's. Not the rest of your family's. Not the rest of the world.", "YTA. What did you expect? No one in your family to get pregnant until you do?", "I am leaning for E S H and Y T A.\n\nYou have no right to dictate your sisters pregnancy announcement at her parents house. If her announcement was at an event you were hosting then sure you have a right to be mad, but it wasn't.\n\nBut the real issue is yours and your husband's reaction, i say this in the nicest way possible but you both need therapy. It's not easy having fertility issues but being upset when someone else is pregnant is not healthy at all. Your fertility problems are yours and your husband's problem. People shouldn't have to walk on eggshells around you regarding this topic. The world doesn't revolve around you and people shouldn't be expected have to cater to your problems.\n\nAlthough, since your sister knew about your issues, it would have been nice if she gave you the heads up before or after she announced it to your folks, or did it without you and you husband there. But I don't think that is enough to call her an A H. I mean she could have been trying for a baby for awhile but felt she could never bring it up because of you.\n\nUltimately, YTA by the way you lashed out at your sister and your husband is for walking off.", "YTA", "YTA. She is your sister. Your parents are also her parents. That seems like the perfect place to announce it, supposedly surrounded by those you love and live you. \nYou should be excited for her. \n\nYour situation sucks, but people can't tip toe around you forever, nor put their own lives on hold. That is being selfish.", "YTA.\n\nim sorry for what you and your husband are going through. that\u2019s really shitty that you\u2019ve been trying and still can\u2019t get pregnant. but it\u2019s not like your sister announced this at your birthday or anniversary party. she and her husband are excited for this new addition to their family, and (rightfully) expected her own family to be supportive. your husbands issues *are* his issues. your sister shouldn\u2019t have to tiptoe around the topic. in your eyes, where would the most appropriate place be for her to announce her pregnancy? she didn\u2019t mess up. you did.", "YTA.   You can still be happy for them and handle your sadness on your own.  It\u2019s not a zero sum game. They did nothing wrong and didn\u2019t \u201ctake\u201d anything from you.   Maybe they are hurt too by your responses and actions.", "Yes YTA", "YTA. You can still be happy for others and contain your emotions.", "YTA so let me get this straight. Since you have fertility issues, nobody else around you is allowed to be pregnant or tell about the subject. This IS a you issue. Apologize to your sister and get some therapy for yourself and your husband", "YTA - you are taking away from their own happiness and how they want to break the news to everyone. Your husband also AH, he needs to grow up, put his emotions aside for a bit and learn to be happy for other family members - unless you both don\u2019t expect anyone else to have babies until your IVF works?", "TA definitely, okay it is sad that u and ur husband can't get pregnant. But u and ur husband are very selfish, why can't ur sister be happy about her pregnancy and announce it???  They should be allowed to have all the joyful experience which brings a pregnancy! You and him should apologise for ruined such a important moment in her life!\n\nAnd besides, maybe u should think about other options. There are so many children outside which need a loving family. I work in a children's home, these kids are awesome. Isn't that so important that ur child has ur DNA?", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having trouble conceiving. I went through the same thing. My SIL announced her pregnancy to the family, having fallen pregnant immediately upon trying when we\u2019d been trying for years.\n\nMy husband and I congratulated her, raised a toast and smiled. We hugged and laughed and cooed over the sonogram. We excused ourselves to cry, cuddle and regroup a short time later. Because it wasn\u2019t about us. It was about her, and her husband, and their child (our nephew).", "You aren't the A H for for having an emotional response.  I'm sure that this whole season has been terribly hard for you and your husband.  I don't blame him for leaving the room.  I may have done the same.  I do experience overwhelming emotions and sometimes I need some privacy so that I can respond to people in a loving way.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I called her selfish and cruel  \nI told her she shouldn't have chose my parents house \n\nthat is NOT responding in a loving way.  Being pregnant and announcing a pregnancy is not selfish or cruel.  Her parent's house is a completely appropriate place to share that joyous news.  You of all people should be able to recognize and appreciate what an amazing blessing it is that your sister is pregnant. You should understand that it is something to be celebrated with family.  I understand that your emotions may have been conflicted.  It IS a hard situation and I am not meaning to invalidate that at all.  But it isn't your sister's fault that it is hard, and it is not fair to blame her.  YTA", "YTA- guessing she didn\u2019t get up and say hahaha I\u2019m pregnant and you suckers can\u2019t have kids so there!!!\nBe happy for your sister.", "Sorry, but YTA.", "YTA.  You and your husband are going to have feelings and I'm so sorry for what you are going through but your sister has every right and reason to tell her family at her parents house.  Your reaction was selfish in the extreme.  You both should apologize.", "If you want it so badly adopt, they need loving homes to even if they aren\u2019t connected by blood, secondly what was she supposed to do? Since you have infertility issues she was just supposed to never have kids to make everything \u201cfair\u201d?", "YTA. You and your husband. I get it. I always thought I'd have kids, found out I couldn't almost 8 years ago. I still struggle with it. I've watched people I went to school with have babies. I've watched my sister-in-law have two and my brother-in-law's fiance just had their baby less than a month ago. It's hard. It hurts to hear and it hurts to watch. But that is not their problem. It's not their job to hide their pregnancy and kids from me because I'll cry about it (and I definitely have). It's my job to work through my trauma and accept that my situation and issues aren't everyone else's.\n\nY'all get to be an aunt and uncle. I cannot tell y'all how wonderful that is. You get to have all the fun because you're close to the kids and then don't have to deal with everything that comes with having your own kids. Y'all literally get to be a best friend first and a parental figure second. Both of y'all are being incredibly selfish and need to work through your issues with infertility. Everyone around y'all cannot stop their lives so you don't feel triggered.", "Yta. I\u2019m sorry you and your husband are struggling with infertility, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone else around you can\u2019t live their own lives and get pregnant. I get it, you\u2019re upset she\u2019s pregnant, by why can\u2019t you be happy for your own sister? You have no idea if she has had her own struggles. You can\u2019t expect everyone to keep tiptoeing around and not living their lives all because of the infertility issue. Also, There\u2019s nothing stopping you and your husband from fostering or adopting children. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been looking at, I have PCOS, haven\u2019t really started trying but I know it\u2019ll be hard and looking at all my options whether it be surrogacy or adoption. People around me are getting pregnant, but I don\u2019t storm out of the room all upset and telling everyone they can\u2019t announce it. It\u2019s rude. I rather be happy for them instead of sitting in my pity and angry at the world.", "YTA. I say that as someone who knows the struggle. You should never ruin someone else\u2019s joy over their pregnancy. If you and/or your husband are struggling with your emotions, you should see a counselor. You and your husband should apologize to your sister and your parents.", "YTA - What did you want her to do? It would be a lose-lose for her no matter what she did, it seems like.", "YTA. I'm sorry y'all are having fertility issues, but you can't expect everyone else to avoid sex and pregnancy cause you can't have a baby.", "Location is irrelevant, they could've given you both a heads up but you both need to be okay with others having kids.", "Sorry but YTA.  You shouldn\u2019t have said all that you said, especially in front of others.  I can understand your husband walking away but I don\u2019t think it was as right.  How do you & your husband react when you hear of other friends & family getting pregnant?  Is your husband afraid that he is the infertile person in your relationship?  It\u2019s totally normal & understandable for you & your husband to feel sad, disappointed or even angry that you haven\u2019t had your turn yet.", "YTA. You can\u2019t force everyone around you to not be happy about having children or keeping it to themselves. If you continue this way you will isolate everyone around you. You need to apologise and grow up.", "YTA there are other ways to have children. Ruining this for your sister and her husband was rude and childish. I will say if that was his reaction if you are the one with the issues. I would be prepared for him to ultimately leave you.", "YTA. Just because you and your husband have fertility issues doesn't give you the right to censor other people, especially in someone else's home. What, is nobody else allowed to reproduce and announce it to *their* family just because life dealt you a bad hand? You both couldn't just put on a brave face and celebrate becoming aunt and uncle to your sister's child? Instead, you made her feel bad about expecting. I know it sucks that you and your husband have had such a rough time of TTC, but yeah, A-hole move there by him pouting and walking out, and you throwing insults and causing an argument. Are you even going to acknowledge your niece or nephew when the baby's born?", "\u201cHey I\u2019m so sorry but\u2026the power went out in our house, and I was wondering\u2026could you also shut off your power?

I'm sorry for your fertility issues but she wasn't trying to rub it in.  When exactly would it have been acceptable for her to announce that she's pregnant? Never? Should your niece or nephew be 30 years old and pregnant themselves before you find out that they exist?  You can't expect someone to tiptoe around you for the rest of their lives.

If he cannot handle the simple fact that other people can have kids he needs therapy. His reaction was absolutely over the top. Apologize to your sister. Tell your husband to get help. Move on.", "This might be controversial, but NAH. Of course they have every right to announce the news to family, and probably weren't thinking of you and your husband. Knowing that it might be a difficult subject for you, though, they could have told you privately beforehand to allow you some time to process those feelings before making the more general announcement. No, they shouldn't walk on eggshells, but asking for some sensitivity from your *sister,* not just some random stranger or coworker, doesn't seem out of line.", "YTA do you not realize that other people have a right to be happy. You don\u2019t have a baby so no one else is allowed to?", "YTA. While your infertility is unfortunate, you should still be happy for others if they can.

The world does not revolve around you and your husband.", "YTA. OP, you can't identify a logical alternative because there is none. This is because you're not acting reasonably.

Understandably, you're reacting from a place of pain.", "YTA\n\nI feel for your situation, and I know how it must hurt so much to hear that others are adding to their family while you want to so much but cannot.\n\nThe answer isn't to rage at everyone who gets pregnant.

Your husbands needs to grow up big time as well.", "ESH, but leaning more towards YTA. \n\nThat\u2019s a moment your sister is allowed to celebrate on her terms with her parents. Yes, she could\u2019ve handled it a bit more sensitively by, maybe, telling you two ahead of time so you weren\u2019t blindsided\u2026 but she didn\u2019t have to do that. This is an important moment for her, and your fertility issues are not her fault. She should be allowed to have that moment, especially if it truly wasn\u2019t meant to be done maliciously. If anything, she didn\u2019t want you to feel left out as she told the family. \n\nThe way you and your husband acted was selfish.

OP was also harsh with how she worded things from the get go. OP could have explained that husband just needed a moment and how happy they were for them.

Those things can all coexist.  I am sorry it is not easy.", "Well she\u2019s the one who said her husband never got the chance to be a father. It comes across like they can\u2019t ever and he\u2019s ancient or something,\n\nI\u2019d also argue it\u2019s shitty to make your infertility issues a personality trait and except the world to revolve around that", "Have my upvote!", "Yeah, I know genius. \n\nBut I\u2019m not the one begging for internet strangers to validate the stranglehold I\u2019ve forced my family into for 5 years. \n\nI could get pregnant fairly easy. My sister needed fertility treatments. What my sister *didnt* do was become a bitter person who is incapable of happiness for friends & family as they started their own. \n\nShe\u2019s has a beautiful teenager now. Surprisingly our children are only months apart.  \ud83d\ude0a", "Actually that\u2018s fair", "In a similar family situation, my cousin told her sister who was having infertility issues privately so that she could work through her emotions about it privately. When the cousin announced her pregnancy at a family dinner the following week she wasn\u2019t blindsided and was able to join in the congratulations.", "A public and unexpected announcement blindsided them.", "I can\u2019t say I agree. It\u2019s considerate to pick up the phone (and far easier than face to face) and if someone really can\u2019t bring themselves to do that and act like an adult, then they really shouldn\u2019t be having kids. If the people on the other end start ranting, then just hang up, but nothing in the post indicates that OP\u2019s husband has an anger issue. \n\nOP didn\u2019t mind the announcement; she objected to the delivery and sister\u2019s subsequent unloading.", "They are adults that are meant to have a close and supportive relationship, not roommates or coworkers. Not taking 5 mins to call with a heads up is a pretty AH move. Almost like they were being tested - and are now blamed - for a reaction that most people could foresee happening. The Sis played stupid games and won stupid prizes as far as I\u2019m concerned.", "This a private heads up would\u2019ve been the courteous thing to do, especially if they knew it was a sensitive topic for them. Then OP and husband could decide if they should be there or not.", "I'd be inclined to vote ESH. Sister should have given OP advance notice. That would have been the kind thing to do. Still, as hurt as OP and her husband were, OP has no business telling her sister she couldn't announce her pregnancy at a family gathering at the parents' house. She should have just excused herself and left with her husband.", "Agreed, a heads up would have blunted the blow to the OP and her husband.", "Exactly what I was thinking. A private word is at the very least a courtesy. It gives them time to process it. Big news in front of everyone though and complaining it\u2019s not the desired reaction? AH move.", "I'm not sure why everyone seems to think the sister's options are surprise public announcement, hide baby forever, or never have a baby.  Private heads up or tell family when they weren't there seems super obvious.", "I agree, a heads up is the least her sister could have given this heartbroken couple. There was no reason to spring it on them like that; under normal circumstances it was a perfectly reasonable thing to do, but given all they've been through, come on. Let OP know beforehand and she can decide how to deal with the announcement. It's not that hard, and it's hardly eggshells.", "Lol! This made me snort out loud!", "Oh gosh my mother let me read that book when I was *faaaaaaaar* too young. It was intense.", "Tbh in the husbands case I think he was fairly understandable: he realised he couldn't deal and absented himself\n\nOp went on the aggressive which is wrong\n\nThis is the kind of thing where emotions are so high that thinking clearly is really hard\n\nOP should apologise to her sister though", "Yeah its hard to rule on this one\nI don't think the husband is an arsehole: he couldn't deal so he removed himself from the situation.\n\nOP should have apologised and gone after him to check on him though, not had it out with her sister at that moment.\n\nDunno if ops sister felt a bit \"damned if you do or don't\"?\n\nBut maybe just telling the parents for the yay separately from sis might have been sensible\n\nIts a really sensitive, hard to navigate topic and it can be hard to anticipate how one will react in the moment", "Na, she could have let her know privately,  as a kindness often shown to family/loved ones, so they aren't expected to process in public. I'm not calling the sister an asshole, and OP went to far in her response,  but there's a middle ground between announcing to everyone in spite of any individual struggles and hiding the pregnancy and entering witness protection.", "I hope you never struggle to have children if you want them. Becoming a parent in other ways is often prohibitively expensive and difficult, and even if accomplished, people are still able to grieve their inability to have their own biological children. I say this as a parent of 3 kids who were easily conceived but I know folks who have struggled and it fucking sucks. (And I\u2019ve been sensitive to their feelings about it because kindness costs nothing.)", "That\u2019s great! I\u2019m glad it was super easy for you! If only it was like that for everyone!!!\n\n\u201cSince it was super easy for me, and it\u2019s a sensitive topic for you guys, you guys shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have kids because of how sensitive you are.\u201d", "I don\u2019t think the sister was wrong in announcing. If she has been at op\u2019s house then I would agree with you. Here is my option how is op and her husband going to handle seeing the sister at events? How is she going to handle the baby shower? Or the birth of this child?\n\nOp\u2019s situation is hard but expecting everyone to walk on egg shells is not reasonable. I had a miscarriage. A. Few weeks later my cousin announced she was pregnant. She didn\u2019t do it out of malleus she was just excited and wanted to tell everyone. As soon as she announced she immediately  apologized. I congratulated them. Just because I was hurting didn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t happy for them. I was more hurt to think she felt like she had to hide her joy.\n\n\nOp\u2019s rant about not doing it at her parents house was wrong. It\u2019s the sisters parents too.", "I agree mildly with esh with op being the bigger one. In my opinion your second sentence should say the sister COULD have given up advance notice, as that would have been the kind thing to do. But she didn't have to, it isn't a 'should' have thing. She might have thought from previous interactions with op that a private disclosure would have been even worse and a bigger deal vs not singling her out and simply telling everyone all at once. She doesn't actually owe op a private announcement, she shared her news the way she felt the best about it.\n\nEdit: Definitely agree with how you describe what op should have done", "She's supposed to let them know that she was going to tell them that she was pregnant? \n\nYou really only need to tell people the once and it wasn't made a big thing.", "Yep they could have handled the announcement better for sure. Doesn\u2019t excuse the sister not giving a heads up, though.", "I know, a private heads up would allow the op to decide if they attended the dinner or not.", "The husband is a snowflake. The circumstances are unfortunate but why should he rain on everyone else\u2019s parade? Should people not announce an engagement because there might be someone in the room who is getting divorced?", "Right? This is getting ridiculous.", "I also agree that OP's husband handled it optimally for the situation. OP should have joined him rather than telling off her sister. That explosion is why I think OP was the AH in the situation.", "I mean it was fairly private? It was just them and their parents - immediate family only. I get not telling them at a big party but I would think immediate family wouldn\u2019t need to be separated.\n\nIf I was telling big news to my family, I wouldn\u2019t think to separately tell my mom from my sister, especially if we had a plan to have dinner together soon.", "Cool story, doesn\u2019t mean that she gets to crap on everyone else having kids", "You seem very upset by me. There is no need to engage with me if it\u2019s not a safe space for you. \n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nGonna edit here - I blocked this dude when he, invariably, regressed to pulling out the old  \u201cdemocrats started the kkk\u201d song and dance. \nEngage at your own risk \u2764\ufe0f", "It may if sister knew OP would ruin the surprise before she had a chance to announce herself. \n\nI agree, giving people suffering with infertility a heads up is the right thing to do. That way they can skip the announcement event if they need too. \n\nBut depending on the people - that can open a can of worms where sister dosent get to announce herself because OP goes nuts and tells everyone 1st. And that\u2019s unfair to the pregnant sister. She should get to enjoy those moments. \n\nBased on OPs reactions and that she\u2019s here asking is kinda telling and makes me think that maybe the case. She doesn\u2019t even think it\u2019s ok her sister made the announcement to their parents in the parents home.", "If you're OK with a scene in front of family, fine. Seems like OPs family isn't like that.", "You\u2019re just a giant asshole.", "There shouldn\u2019t have been a scene. They must know their friends and family may have kids and they should have the grace to congratulate them even if it also makes them sad.", "Wow. You really were upset - was it the \u201chave a great weekend\u201d part that trigger you \ud83d\udc40\n\nMaybe stay off Reddit when you\u2019re in such a delicate state.  Can\u2019t be good for your mental health.", "Nope it was you telling a woman she shouldn\u2019t be able to have kids because she\u2019s sensitive she can\u2019t conceive. That\u2019s fucked up.", "She and her husband are emotionally abusive, not sensitive."]}
