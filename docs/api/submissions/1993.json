We have been getting treated and trying for a baby since 2017. But nothing worked! My husband is understandably devastated as he'd always wanted kids but never got the chance to be a father.\n\n\nHe's super sensitive aroubd the infertility topic. This my family knows. Days ago, we got together with family for dinner. All of a sudden, my sister and her husband announced that they were expecting. We were stunned, me and my husband I mean. As for the others they were thrilled. As everyone got up to congratulate them. My husband got up, pushed his chair to the side and walked out. They all stared at me but I got up and told my sister she messed up by announcing her pregnancy like this and with 0 consideration for my husband knowing how he feels about this topic. She got defensive saying his \"issues\" with the topic wasn't her problem and that she and her husband were fed up walking on eggshells around him. I called her selfish and cruel but she complained that he ruined their joy and that I made it worse by making a scene. I told her she shoukdn't have chose my parents house but she said I have no place to dictate what she does in our parents house. My mom asked me to go home and I went.\n\n\nIt's been horrible. My parents think I've reacted poorly and should apologize to my sister on both mine and my husband's behalf after the scene we made at their home.", "created_utc": 1668114015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrrojm/aita_for_calling_my_sister_selfish_for_announcing/", "score": 6626, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unfortunate situation but where else is your sister supposed to announce that she's pregnant?  Or is she supposed to keep it a secret?", "YTA\nShe is pregnant. What else should she do than to tell everybody and be happy about it?\n\nYou are allowed to be sad about your unfulfilled wish for children. It's also ok to not be as happy as everybody else about the announcement. But in a private moment you should apologize to you sister and tell her that you are happy for her. That you wish her all the best and the bad emotions are not about her pregnancy but about your unfulfilled childwish. \n\nAnd I am realistic: In case you won't get any own children, you will be happy for every niece and nephew. \n\nI wish you all the best. That you can practice with the kid of your sister and will have a lovely relationship to it. And that you soon are allowed to hold your own kid in your arms.", "YTA and sister is right, you cannot expect everyone to walk on eggshells around you and your husband. I kind of see where this is heading too, she is supposed not to come to family dinners by the time her belly shows out of \"consideration\" or smth like this. Sorry but this is something you have to learn to deal with, you cannot expect people to accommodate you to the point they cannot speak about their pregnancy (eg announce it)", "YTA. Were they just supposed to never tell you guys? How is SHE the selfish one here?", "YTA. You can't be happy for your sibling? You and your husband acted selfishly and should apologize.", "YTA. I understand that it\u2019s hard for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean nobody else should have kids because you can\u2019t. Stop being so entitled.", "YTA.\nOther people are allowed to be happy.  \nYour fertility issues aren't anyone else's problem. Your sister probably thought it was good news and wanted to share with her whole family.\n\nHow selfish of your husband and you to make it about you.", "YTA - this is a private family dinner at your parents house with your family and your sisters family.  When else is she supposed to announce her news?  It wasn't a wedding, or any type of public event, you've got no cause to be angry.  \n\nI understand that you and your husband are having difficulty conceiving, and I sympathize, however the rest of the world is continuing to move forward.  I know that's harsh for you to hear, but you have to thicken up your skin.  This wasn't about you or your husband - it was about your sister and you totally ruined her exciting news.", "YTA\n\nYour parents are right. You should apologize. The world doesn't tiptoe around your infertility problems. It's a cruel fact, believe me but you can't expect everyone to muffle their celebrations and happiness just to accommodate for your struggles. If this were a new struggle, perhaps but it doesn't seem to be.\n\nThe cruelest thing about life is that it continues on no matter how hurtful.", "YTA simple. Others shouldn't hide their happiness because you and your husband have it difficult. Your sister and her husband have every right to express and share their happiness with others.", "YTA. What exactly would you consider an appropriate way for her to announce her pregnancy? Or did you expect her to keep it a secret until the child was born, until it was old enough to graduate, for the rest of their lives?", "YTA - I guess the world should stop and no one should announce any happy news, because you can't conceive. You're but a tiny speck in the universe, get over yourself.", "YTA in this and you really should apologize. It's not your place to dictate how she tells the family she's expecting. It's appropriate at a family dinner. It's not appropriate at a wedding, which this wasn't. I'm sorry for the struggles you are facing but your sister really didn't do anything wrong. Your parents are right that you handled this poorly.\n\nEdit to add: Maybe consider therapy and getting some grief counseling? I think it would be beneficial for the both of you so you are better prepared for these types of situations and can handle them more gracefully.", "Yta. Sorry about ur issues but people dont have to stop their lives over you. Do u believe in life there we be no child bc u cant have there. Ivf or adoption. Dont rain on their parade. Again im sorry", "YTA\n\nYou took your brother in law and sister's joyous announcement and made it about your and your husband's problems.\n\nEveryone has been tiptoeing around your fertility issues for 5 years. And you couldn't let them have 5 minutes of excitement. \n\nBefore you say something like, \"no one understands,\" my husband and I had miscarriage after miscarriage until we decided to live our lives, happily, child free. And yes, we're happy for our friends who announce their pregnancies.", "YTA. I get it. The anniversary of the miscarriage of my only pregnancy is approaching. Infertility is a bigger struggle than people who have not dealt with realized but life doesn't stop for everyone because of what you and your husband are going through. Your sister should not be denied the chance to share her happiness at her parents home.", "YTA be happy for your sister Jesus shes allowed to tell family she's pregnant", "YTA. Infertility is heartbreaking and difficult, but you and your husband were very out of line. You both owe everyone an apology for how you acted. \n\nMore importantly, though, you and your husband should strongly consider grief counseling. The grief that comes from wanting to be a parent and having problems conceiving is all-consuming and not treating the grief will create lots of problems and extra suffering for you. It's already straining your familial relationships. You are about to get a new addition to the family and addressing your grief now, with a professional's help, will go a long way to allowing your relationships to survive and will also allow you to be present and engaged in your new nibling's life.", "YTA\n\nI am sorry for your infertility issues. However, you don't get to take happiness away from other people because of it. \n\nWhere were they supposed to announce the pregnancy? Or were they just supposed to keep it a secret? And what happens when the baby shows up? Will them bringing the baby around be \"rubbing it in your face\" too?", "YTA \n\nNot your house, not your rules\n\nYour mother was correct to ask you to leave after causing a scene", "YTA your sister should not be expected to not be excited about her pregnancy because of your husband. \n\nWhile his feelings are valid, if he is struggling this bad then he needs to seek therapy.", "YTA\n\nThe degree of control that you are trying to exercise over your family members is grossly inappropriate.  I don't know how far you expect to be able to take this.  If you are all on Facebook, is she not allowed to post an announcement because your husband might see it?  Is she not allowed to tell any common acquaintances because they might share the news? \n\nAt some point your husband needs to recognize that it's not all about him.", "YTA unfortunately life goes on and part of that is friends and family having children. As heartbreaking as your situation is your sister has every right to announce her pregnancy at a family dinner as long as it wasn\u2019t a special occasion for someone else.\n\nYou and your husband reacted poorly. I am sure your sister, bil and your parents have been supportive of your struggles. You need to be supportive with your sisters good news. Truthfully no matter how or when she announced her pregnancy you or your husband would have reacted poorly. It\u2019s not fair for you or him to expect them not to have children or be happy when they do.\n\nI would suggest you and your husband go to counseling before it ruins your relationship with your friends and family. And you do owe your sister an apology and so does your husband.", "yta \ud83e\udee4 sorry, if you were at your own house or it was an event about one or both of you two, then it's a dick move on your sister's part, but it was just a family dinner. it is rough, I understand, but your sister is right that she has the right to share news as she's part of the family and that was a family dinner.", "YTA \u2014 your struggles are not your sisters struggles. If the roles were reversed would you have stayed childless for her sake?", "Very much YTA\n\nThis is not about you or your husband. Your sister is also her HER parents' house and wanted to share their good news. They don't owe you anything and it's unfair or you or your husband to expect to lessen themselves because of your struggles. They have every right to be excited and share that with the family.", "YTA\n\nI understand the sensitivity about the topic, but you shouldn't expect other people to hide their blessings. From the lack of context, I'm sure you're sister did not mean it out of spite, but saw the perfect moment to share the news with the most important people in her life. You and your husband took that moment away from her when you made it about yourselves, rather than congratulating her and dealing with your emotions separately.\n\nI do wish you both the best and hope you can one day start a family- be it through surrogacy or adoption.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\nSomeone with a shit ton of health problems, a low chance of ever carrying children, watching everyone else around her start a family.", "YTA\n\nThe reactions of you and your husband were uncalled for, yes your sister was extremely rude in her response. But, would she have had that kind of response if not for yalls reactions?\n\nI mean is all the happiness of her family supposed to stop, because of yalls unfortunate struggles?", "Yta\nLook.  I get it. \nI've wanted to be a mom since I was 15.\nI've even been pregnant but wasn't in a safe place to keep my baby. \nMy fiance died and I was alone for 8 years\n8 years of wishing is had kids sooner and worrying that I never will. \nI still don't have kids and I don't know if I still can or if I ever will and I try not to think about it because it breaks my heart. \nAnd I see my friends and family having kids that I don't have and I know how much it hurts. \n\nYou and your husband have every reason to be upset.  \nI can even get behind your husband walking out for his own well being and probably because he didn't want to ruin your sister's happy news by breaking down and leaving seemed like the better option. \n\nBut you.... you are an AH for berating your sister for sharing her happy news with her family. \nThe appropriate thing to do, if you can't politely congratulate them,  is to apologize that this is difficult for you and your husband and excuse yourself.", "YTA. Everything in your extended family doesn't revolve around you. Why shouldn't you be happy for your sister just like everyone else was? You do owe your sister an apology - though your husband owes a bigger one. He needs to cope with his own disappointment and not expect the rest of the world to do it for him.", "YTA. It is pretty bad that you and your partner can't conceive, but that's not a reason for people to avoid being happy whenever and wherever they want. \nSad, but you both need to deal with it before that problem becomes worse and bitter.", "YTA. I feel even if you sister had a special dinner with just your parents, or with all the family without you and your husband in attendance, you would still feel angry that your sister and her husband are pregnant. Your post would be about having to hear that your sister is pregnant from other family members. \n\nI think both you and your husband need to talk through this and possibly get some therapy because the way you have treated your sister so far is horrible and she will likely not tell you anything regarding her family in the future. You won't get the updates about her child like the rest of the family.", "YTA because you are having fertility issues doesn't mean others are not allowed to be happy about their pregnancies. You and your husband need to get a grip and get over yourselves. The two of you are not the center of your family's universe.", "YTA. I do think it\u2019s shitty of your sister not to give you a head\u2019s up, but babies will be born whether you have kids or don\u2019t.\n\nIt isn\u2019t about you.", "YTA\n\nThey chose the right place and time to announce it.  Your husbands emotional hang ups on it are his responsibility, not your sisters.  I get that it sucks not being a dad, especially if you want to be one.  But that doesn't mean other people have to walk on eggshells for you or your husband.  You both live in a world where most people will have children.  You two have to learn how to cope with that fact without calling others selfish.", "Gently, YTA and your husband is too.   \nIf this happened at your home, I would have a harder time with my judgement... but this was your parent's home. This was your parents child letting them know they were going to be grandparents. \n\nYou and your husband are the ones that acted selfishly. Your fertility struggles do not mean no one else in your family can have children you know...", "YTA. I understand it\u2019s an extremely difficult thing you are going through, it doesn\u2019t make you entitled to stop other people sharing their good news. You and your husband need to deal with your feelings attached to the topic because it\u2019s not fair that everyone else should have to walk on eggshells because of your own issues. Many people have issues with fertility but it does not mean  they have the right to take others joyous moments away from them.", "YTA. I understand that this is a sensitive topic for you and your husband. However, the world continues to turn. It is not okay to ruin someone else's joy for your misery. She's allowed to be happy that she's pregnant. You are allowed to be sad that you're not, and your husband is allowed to be sad. You are not allowed to demand people walk on eggshells around you. Your boundaries are for YOU.\n\nSo not going to a baby shower? Yeah, that makes sense. Not baby sitting? Also makes sense. Demanding that no one talk about babies or be happy that they're pregnant? Not okay.", "YTA. I\u2019m genuinely sorry to hear you are struggling with this, but you can\u2019t expect other people to walk on egg shells and hide their joy because you can\u2019t have something they do. Are you going to be upset seeing updates on social media? Will you be upset seeing her in person once she begins to show? Or pics after the baby is born? Or her bringing the baby to family events? You can\u2019t expect people to hide themselves away to spare your feelings. I get how terrible it must feel to see someone have what you so desperately want, but it is not fair to take out your feelings on other people like this. They did nothing wrong by sharing this news with their own family. If you and your husband are struggling this much I think you should look into therapy. Best of luck!\n\nEdited to add- here are a few aita stories from more of your sisters perspective.

You're not the centre of the universe.", "Hypothetically if you and your husband were to fall pregnant and announce it to your family, would you want your family to be happy and congratulate you or storm out of the room and make it about themselves?

I myself am struggling to conceive (not far off giving up), but my nephew is the light of my life, and I will give that child everything I have. Fix your attitude before it\u2019s too late.", "YTA \n\nShe didn\u2019t announce it at a wedding or a birthday party, she announced it at her parents house in front of family.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have to hide it and she\u2019s entitled to feel joy and share her news. It\u2019s a shame that you and your husband spoiled that for her.", "YTA. Sorry about the fertility issues, but your sister is allowed to celebrate her pregnancy and share the news with family. You and your husband are being ridiculous, what are you even mad about?", "Yta. My partner and I had fertility issues. I would not care and have not cared when people have announced their pregnancy. Why is it all about you and your husband? \n\nIf you and your husband got divorced, should people keep quiet about their engagements, because of your struggles during marriage?\n\nFertility issues suck, but nobody should cater to you and your husband. It is in no way insensitive to announce a pregnancy.", "Look I\u2019m going to say this gently but YTA. \n\nI get it infertility SUCKS. My husband and I have been trying for over 6 years now. But my solution for announcements from family? Ask to be told via text first. Before any big announcement. That\u2019s how I approached it with my SIL explained I would be sad for myself but thrilled for them and would just need some private time to grieve on my own. (That plus finally getting back on zoloft for depression and anxiety really helped me not lose my shit) \n\nJust because you\u2019re hurting doesn\u2019t mean you can lash out on your sister. You need to take proactive steps for future announcements from family and friends and both you and your husband need to be in therapy to address your grief and healthy ways to cope.", "YTA your personal problems as adults do not trump other adults' rights to celebrate, announce or share their own excitement.  It wasn't like they upstaged your wedding.  I'm sorry for your troubles but y'all are the selfish ones here and how those troubles keep you from being happy for others.", "YTA  \n \nI have a great deal of sympathy for you and your husband struggling to conceive. It can be devastating and I wouldn\u2019t wish that struggle on anyone. I hope you\u2019re both seeking mental health care to help you navigate your journey. \n\nWith that said, your sister and her husband announcing their pregnancy was not about you. It was about them. And they\u2019re allowed to celebrate it. I think your husband removing himself from the room was the right move for him in the moment but you had no right to call out your sister like that. She\u2019s right that it\u2019s not fair to them to have to walk on eggshells. \n\nYou did react poorly. Now it\u2019s up to you to try to mend fences. And I think part of that mending needs to include a plan for how to navigate pregnancy and babies going forward. What will happen once the baby is born? Or if they have another child? You need answers to those questions because this kid is gonna be sticking around and it would be extremely unfair to everyone to behave as though the child is anything other than a blessing.", "A major YTA and you know it", "Yta. What was the alternative just show up with a baby one day? It\u2019s not all about you", "YTA.  Your sister and her husband are entitled to their joy and happiness.  Your husband and you both acted like children throwing a tantrum.", " YTA I know you are struggling but to tell someone they can\u2019t make an announcement. You guys need therapy that is just crazy. The happiest time for her but sounds like you will not allow her to enjoy", "YTA. Y'all need to figure a way to deal with your infertility that isn't causing everyone around you issues. Hubby definitely needs therapy if it's that bad. And yes you both caused a scene.", "Yta don\u2019t blow out others candles just shine brighter. Your sister wanted to celebrate something wonderful, you and your husband ruined that. Please get therapy.", "YTA and y'all DID ruin her joy. You guys have infertility issues so now NOBODY is allowed to be pregnant? Please.", "YTA. Life doesn\u2019t revolve around you, your sister is allowed to be happy and to share that with her family.", "YTA Where else but a family gathering, that isn't focused around something else (ie wedding), is more appropriate to announce?", "YTA, and your husband too.\n\nIt's understandable that this is a sore topic for him and for you. But your sister is right about the fact that everyone else can't be walking on eggshells around you and your husband so as to not upset you. Life goes on.\n\nAnd your husband was out of line for essentially throwing a tantrum. If this is such a big issue for him, then it's something that he needs to seek professional help with in the form of therapy.", "YTA. \n\nWhen we announced our pregnancy to my brother in law and his wife, the wife burst into tears and went on a long angry rant about their infertility and fairness. I get infertility is hard and upsetting, but the world does not revolve around you and your husband. \n\nYOUR HUSBAND ruined your sisters happy moment. He is TA. And YTA.", "Yta....sorry i get people in your situation have feelings but you all need to stop acting out at others for being able to conceive and sharing their good news. People will not.be putting all their announcements on hold because of others issues. Stop making your problems others problems to consider it isn't right.\n\nEta....you can't tell someone what to announce in someone else's home either", "YTA - it's awful you have infertility issues, but your issues shouldn't pull down someone else's joy. You have to separate your issues and other people's happiness. They announced it at a family get together. To the whole family. To people they wanted to share the joy with. You should've apologized on your husband's behalf, congratulated your sister, been excited to be an aunt, and then consoled your husband. Are you going to get mad at everyone who has a baby? Be realistic.", "YTA.  Not for being upset, but for the way you and your husband handled it.  Now you both owe your sister and your parents an apology for acting like children.  You both also need to decide if you can act like decent humans around your sister and her eventual child from here on out or if that relationship is essentially over because she dared to get pregnant.", "YTA. Just because you're lost something doesn't mean other people shouldn't celebrate what they've gained.", "YTA. I am you. We are not able to have kids and it has been a struggle. It is OUR struggle. I would NEVER want anyone to lessen their joy because of my infertility.  My sister announced  her first pregnancy Christmas  eve and you better believe I was thrilled and heart broken. But I waited till we were in the car on our way home to cry. Your sister has every right to announce  her pregnancy to her family. It is up to you and your husband to deal with those feelings in an adult manner. What do you expect her to do? Show up one day with a baby? Both you and your husband need to get I to therapy  to deal with these feelings.", "YTA, I get that infertility is hard, really hard. BUT, you can't expect to not have others get pregnant around you ever.  That's not fair to anyone else.  When would you expect her to announce?  I mean, it sounds like the whole nuclear family was at dinner so perfect timing.", "YTA and so is your husband.\n\nSorry this is happening to you guys but the world keeps spinning and your sister has every right and absolutely should announce her pregnancy at your parents house. Your husband needs to figure something out because he can't throw temper tantrums every time someone he knows gets pregnant", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry you all are dealing with infertility, but your sister is right. She doesn't have to not announce her pregnancy at BOTH OF YOUR PARENTS homes. They are her parents too. You and your husband need to be in therapy if you can't handle others being pregnant. \n\nThere are also plenty of other ways to have children in this day and age.", "Kindly, YTA. While I understand it must be very hard to deal with infertility... the world doesn't stop spinning because of it. Your sister is allowed to get pregnant and to be happy about it. You are the selfish one if you think she shouldn't talk/announce it/enjoy it, and you are selfish if you think she should handle her pregnancy and anything related to it differently because of your struggle. She shouldn't have to live in your shadow.", "YTA. I'm very sorry for you and your husband's situation, but you can't expect everyone around you to censor their joy at pregnancies. Your sister has the right to be excited and happy, and to share it with the family. Are you going to swear off all family events if her child, or children, attends? You need to find healthy ways to process your situation rather than being angry at others.", "YTA- Your and your husband's fertility issues are tough, devastating and I understand that it is hard. Any feelings of jealously, sadness, etc. are completely valid. The **behavior** of expecting your sister and family to walk on eggshells around you guys is not. Your sister is allowed to have her joy and happiness. Would it have been nice if she gave you a heads up? Yes. Is it required? No. \n\nPerhaps you and your husband need to see a mental health professional if you aren't already.", "There is no ESH here. YTA, plain and simple. It is not your sister's fault that you two were unable to have children. She shouldn't have to decide how she announced her pregnancy around you and your husband's feelings. This is a time of joy for her. \n\nGet help for your husband and apologise. Otherwise you face a very real risk of having zero relationship with any nephews and nieces. Your sister will easily think if they can't cope with hearing the word pregnant how will they cope seeing a baby/toddler/child etc.", "YTA. Whose house should she have announced it in? Infertility sucks, but the world around you is not going to stop because of it. She didn't get pregnant at you and your husband. You were the ones who made her pregnancy about you and probably ruined something that was an important moment to her. You do owe her an apology. This should be a wake up call that you and your husband need to be in therapy to learn to manage your emotions around infertility. Others are going to have babies. It's going to hurt you. But you hurting them isn't going to change anything for you.", "YTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to Rob other people of joy just because you are grieving. \n\nYou and your husband were inconsiderate and selfish.", "Awww honey. I'm glad you're sensitive to your hubby's needs but you are def TA here.  \n\n\nFamily get togethers are where family members share stuff. Was she supposed to just hide the pregnancy, the baby?   \n\n\nYou and your husband now have two choices: Learn how to be adults who are going through something hard OR lose your sister and her family and maybe your parents bc there is going to be showers and the birth and first steps and birthdays and the first grandbaby stuff at holidays. This is what life is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suggest you guys sit down and together figure out how you're going to behave moving foward that isn't joy-sucking, event-ruining for everyone else  \n\n\nI'm sorry you are going through this, but your struggles do not negate other people's lives", "YTA. For all reasons given above: life goes on. Will he refuse to see the child once it is born, should they just hide it until it is old enough? There are many ways in becoming. Have you considered an adoption? In any case, maybe you both need to have counselling.", "YTA\n\nI get that it comes from a place of hurt but it's not about you or your husband. You definitely owe them an apology.", "YTA.\n\nI get it. You and your husband have had infertility struggles and that's awful and I'm so sorry.\n\nBut it's also pretty awful to project that pain onto other people, especially at places and times where the conversation was not about you or your infertility struggles. Your sister has nothing to do with the pain you've gone through and she was just hoping you'd be happy for her. Will you be getting upset at somebody every time anybody brings up babies around you?\n\nAnd it's TOTALLY OK if you aren't ready to be happy for her because of the pain you've gone through, but your feelings are absolutely not her fault. I think there could've been a more tactful way to let her know that you'd like to be happy for her, but that it might take time because of the pain you've endured.", "YTA\nI feel for you, but you and your husband are overstepping from hurt in to selfish territory.

It's not only your parent's house, it's also HER parents' house, of course she'd want to share that with her parents who are soon to be grandparents. It's unfortunate that the two of you are infertile, but that doesn't mean that she can't share important life-changing news with her family.

Wtf dude. Come on. \nYou can be sad and jealous, but angry is totally misplaced.

You owe your parents and your sister and her husband both apologies.", "YTA, the entitlement is unbelievable!! People can't have babies? And people  cant be happy about having a baby around your husband because you're infertile?! What the heck?! You did ruin her joy and announcement Dude!! The world can't tippy toe around your husband's feelings.  \n\nSo when you get pregnant will you be happy and announce it at your parents?? Does she get her moments back when you're expecting?? No!!

But...\nYTA on this.  Your sister is right, you can't dictate what she says at your parents and this was something to be shared and not talked about in hushed voices. \n\nYou should be happy for her regardless of your struggles and maybe even more happy than others because you know the struggles that can happen.\n\nIt would have been nice if she told you and your husband in private before breaking it publicly.", "GUYS STOP COMMENTING YTA I CANT LIKE COMMENTS FASTER", "YTA.

Your husband needs therapy badly because even if you manage to have a kid he's going to damage it with the baggage he's collecting along the way.", "Gentle YTA. Why shouldn't she announce it? So they have to pretend and minimize their joy so as not to upset you? That's not fair. Where is she supposed to announce it? Are you also going to expect them to never bring the baby around you?", "These one's are always tough for me for personal reasons.  \n\n\nI think in this situation, sadly, it's a YTA. Announcing a pregnancy at their parent's house is... pretty standard. Like you can't expect everyone around you to just never talk about babies. It sucks but there it is. If this were at an event like your wedding or your birthday or something like that then that changes things but this sounds like a random dinner. It sucks, but they can't just never talk/celebrate their kiddo ever.

We don't have infertility issues (that we know of), we just don't have all the required parts (she's a woman and I'm AFAB), so we have to take the long way around which, as anyone who has been through this process knows, can take for actual ever. In the meantime, people announce their pregnancies on Facebook, in person, her sister even had her *second* baby.

Your sister could have handled this differently. ideally, spoken to you and your husband ahead of time so that you wouldn't be blind sided but she is also entitled to joy and to announce her pregnancy how she wants. The weekend before my very first IVF transfer, after years of infertility and quite a few false starts, my little sister announced her pregnancy. Mind you, at the time she wasn't in a relationship (my niece is basically the product of a one night stand) had no job and was 30 living completely off my parents. She is now a great mom and i love my niece to pieces but at the time she was a complete effing screw up.  even still--her pregnancy was NOT ABOUT ME. infertility is not an excuse to behave the way you behaved. also you and your husband need to work on how you're going to handle pregnancy announcements. because at around your stage of life you're in for A LOT of them coming at you from every angle.", "YTA and your behavior gives those struggling with infertility a bad name.

She did eventually have a child, but because of what she did we don\u2019t have a relationship with her or that nephew. Your narrow minded selfishness is going to cost you your family.

The hopelessness and relationship impacts are unimaginable, and this goes without saying. \n\nHowever. This is your situation. Your family feels for you, I'm sure of it. You cannot expect them to taper their own wants or excitement in solidarity with your infertility struggles. It is unfair to ask this of them. \n\nHad the shoe been on the other foot I feel you'd hope that your family would be happy for you despite their own personal struggles, and not rain on your parades during such a happy moment that should be filled with family togetherness, closeness and excitement. \n\nYour sister is not selfish for becoming pregnant. You are not selfish for feeling \"left out\" of the club. Everyone has a right to an independent thought process here, which is completely fair. But blurring the lines between the two because you're feeling left out due to your own personal struggles, isn't fair or a reason to treat your sister this way.", "YTA.\nIs everyone supposed to \n1. Hide their pregnancies around you and your husband forever?\n2. Just never get pregnant because, well, if you can't have a baby, nobody should?\n\nIt's unfortunate that you aren't able to get pregnant. It is. But that doesn't mean other people can't be excited for their own babies. You have options. He wants to be a father, try to adopt if you can't get pregnant.", "YTA. Your infertility issues are your own and you can\u2019t expect other people to put their lives on hold or tiptoe around you.

I had to smile while seemingly everyone around me was announcing their pregnancies. I went to baby showers and birthday parties. I watched all the Snapchat videos and Liked all the baby posts. My heart was in ruins the entire time. Still, I never let my hurt ruin the joy of others. I talked about my pain at appropriate times and received the comfort and support that I needed. It\u2019s possible to be sad and still celebrate for others. Life doesn\u2019t stop and expecting others to cater to your feelings at the expense of their own is really selfish.", "YTA. As someone who has to deal with fertility issues, I understand how hard it is. However, my difficulty staying pregnant in no way diminished my joy for my family and friends who were pregnant or who had kids. It's selfish to expect otherwise. I do have a daughter, so I was able to have \"my turn\" after losing 2 pregnancies. (One was twins) Expecting everyone else to walk on eggshells around you or or put their lives on hold is selfish. Your sister should get to share her news and celebrate her pregnancy with her family without being made to feel like crap.", "YTA. Not having kids rules. Lean into it, go on cool vacations.

I know this is hard on you and your husband, but you don\u2019t get to make it everyone else\u2019s problem.

Her joy doesn't rob you of yours.", "YTA\n\nIt would have been nice,\u00a0and emotionally aware, if your sister had let you know discreetly ahead of time that she was going to share this news and given you some time to process it on your own. But not doing that does not make her an asshole. \n\nI know that it's painful for both you and your husband to hear news like this. More importantly, though, *you* both know that it's painful for you, and you need to figure out a better strategy for dealing with other people's pregnancy news than expecting them not to share it in front of you. That might be a few sessions with a therapist, or it might just be accepting that managing your emotions is your responsibility, not everyone else's. \n\nIt's completely OK for you to feel sad about this news \u2014 or happy, or a complicated mix of various good and bad emotions. Having the emotions is not the problem and not what makes you the asshole. How you deal with your emotions, and using them to justify being jackasses to other people, is what does it. \n\nYou should apologize, and more importantly you should get the help you need to deal with your grief and sadness in a way that won't damage the other relationships in your life.", "Super gentle yta from a fellow infertile couple.

That is especially true around immediate family! \n\nMy sil just got pregnant with their 2nd and while it totally gutted my spouse and I, we would never try and steal their joy, or be angry with them for sharing their lives with their family. After we shared in their joy we took a moment together at home to feel our feelings. Your husband excusing himself to me is okay, but being angry at them is not. I\u2019m sorry you and your husband are going through this! It\u2019s super tough!!! However it\u2019s not okay to do what you did.

You and your husband both need therapy.", "YTA.\nSo the rule is cause you and your husband are going through something hard. That means no joy or baby news for anyone else. No one gets to make big announcements cause it might trigger you or your husband.  Why are your feelings more valid than others? Why do you get to control how others act or what the right time is. You swallow the pain and congratulate your sister.  Then, open up the pain when you come home. Grief over it and pray you get your chance. You do not stomp on their joy cause they did not go about it like you wanted\n And yes, I know the pain of peeing on that stick and getting nothing again and again.

But the sister didn't have to announce it right there and then in front of everyone, with the husband (and OP) , sitting RIGHT THERE. Wouldn't it have been kinder to wait and tell them another time? Doing that wouldn't change anything, they would still be expecting and everyone would still be able to enjoy it. Yes, that would probably still hurt at other times, but at least OP and her husband would know that they *tried* to consider his feelings. This way it's like they don't actually give a shit and it's all about them.\n\nLook at it this way, if OP had recently had a baby that died, would they still think it was ok to announce it? Or would they, more likely, have a bit of compassion and tell the parents in private, and then maybe tell OP in private too so it could be done more sensitively. I'm sure most commenters would agree to NTA in that situation. So what you're all (and the family) are basically saying, is that infertility struggles are no big deal and they should just get over it? That, to me, is pretty selfish and hurtful.", "I'm gonna say NTA. Your sister sprung this on you and that's unfair. She could've given you a heads up privately, that's the etiquette in situations like this. Then you could've either excused yourself from the moment she told your parents or at least prepared yourself and your husband. Did you and your husband react badly? Sure.

They all stared at me but I got up and told my sister she messed up by announcing her pregnancy like this and with 0 consideration for my husband knowing how he feels about this topic. She got defensive saying his \"issues\" with the topic wasn't her problem and that she and her husband were fed up walking on eggshells around him. I called her selfish and cruel but she complained that he ruined their joy and that I made it worse by making a scene. I told her she shoukdn't have chose my parents house but she said I have no place to dictate what she does in our parents house. My mom asked me to go home and I went.\n\n\nIt's been horrible.

Be happy for the success of other people.", "YTA, i'm so sorry about your situation and that's a really terrible thing to go through but your sister and her husband shouldn't be made to feel bad or shamed because they are having a baby when you are struggling. She was sharing some good news with her family and even though it's hard for you, you can't expect her to tiptoe around you.", "You can\u2019t police everyone and their own fertility when you are struggling. Maybe she should have given you a heads up but she didn\u2019t.", "YTA\n\nI'm very sorry for yours and your husband's pain, but this wasn't about either of you. Are you so selfish that you can't be happy for your own sister?", "Apologize. Its not their fault you guys cant have kids and no one should put their life on hold for you. Im sorry you guys cant have children, but what is everyone else supposed to do?", "Yta. Your infertility struggles have nothing to do with your sister. How else were they supposed to announce it?", "YTA and your husband is TA. I\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through. Doesn\u2019t mean your sister should stop living her own life. She should be able to share her pregnancy and joy with loved ones without you and your husband making it all about yourselves.", "YTA. Your fertility problems are not your sister\u2019s problems. Be adults, you don\u2019t seem mature enough to have kids anyways.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having fertility issues and unsuccessful getting pregnant, but that\u2019s no excuse to rain on other people\u2019s parade.  What was she supposed to do? Hide it?  Act nonchalant about it? It is exiting for her and those who love her and while it may sting for you, surely you don\u2019t want her to be sad or afraid to discuss this huge thing.", "**YTA**. Why are you and your husband so selfish that you thought your parents would not and should not be able to hear that they have a grandchild on the way just because you were present? Do you think they are not allowed to be happy about that because you and your husband have fertility issues? Are you genuinely incapable of being happy for your sister and her husband because of your situation?\n\nI get that not being able to have children is hard and that you deserve empathy for your situation. However, I don't get this expectation that it makes pregnancy news a forbidden subject just because you happen to be in the vicinity. You are asking too much.", "YTA \nI genuinely feel for you, the struggle is painful and emotionally difficult. So apologize to your sister. \n\nShe chose the normal, natural place to announce her pregnancy. This is a life altering event, and there's no way to keep it a secret. Your husband's feelings were going to be hurt one way or another, probably more so if she started to show and didn't tell you. \n\nApologize to your sister, that the struggle has taken its mental toll and you don't want to lose a good relationship over forces no one can truly control.", "YTA\n\nIf they're going to be in your life, you're going to find out somehow. You were within your right to walk out and recover, but you had no right to berate her for announcing her news to the family.\n\nYour husband can't let his trauma become everybody else's if he wants a good relationship with a growing family.", "YTA. Your sister is right here. Sorry this is happening to you and your husband but people shouldn't have to walk on eggshells or not share their hapiness because of your issues.", "YTA and you and your husband need therapy. Does everyone have to walk on eggshells with him or what? You're being selfish by not allowing others be happy for their pregnancy news, sorry you guys can't have a baby but no one needs to cater to you because you haven't processed your grief. Get help to process this and understand you both would've gotten mad when you would see her showing her belly anyways.", "First of all, I'm so sorry - the struggle of infertility is truly devastating and no one who hasn't been through it can relate. That being said, I'm veering on a very gentle Y T A, maybe even ESH.   \n\n\nY T A - because despite the pain you and your husband have and clearly are still suffering, your sister shouldn't have to downplay or hide a significant moment in her life because of that, and, announcing a pregnancy in your family home is completely normal. YNTA for feeling the way that you do (same for your husband) *but* your reaction is in A territory. \n\non the E S H side, knowing the pain/history you and your husband have around this topic, I think the kind and gracious thing for your sister to do would have been to call you and your husband and give you the heads up on this so that you were prepared for the announcement.   \n\n\nAgain, i'm sorry this is what you're going through - its devastating. But, you can't expect those around you to hide significant things in their life because of that. It's sad, and at times maybe even feels unfair, but, it's true.   \n\n\nI hope you and your husband can come to a feeling of peace around this.", "YTA. \n\nAs someone who has experienced a loss, I understand how difficult pregnancy announcements are, but after this length of time your sister wasn\u2019t being unreasonable by telling her close family in the way she did.\n\nA friend of mine fell pregnant months after my loss, and although it hurt when she told me, I didn\u2019t react like this and was happy for her, alongside my pain. After the period of time that had passed for you, it\u2019s not unreasonable at all that your sister acted the way she did.", "YTA you can not dictate when and where your sister announces her pregnancy, while yes it may have been nice to get a heads up about it before the main announcement you are not entitled to it. She is not responsible for what upset you or your husband. Asking for other to tip toe around the topic of pregnancy is not fair thing of you to expect from others. The announcement was her and her partners moment to enjoy, your parents moment to enjoy knowing they'll be grandparents while it may have upset you and your partner you could have congratulated her at the very least before leaving to comfort your husband. \nDid you expect her to put her life on hold while you try for a baby? Did you want her to wait on the announcement till the baby was born or the bump was noticeable for others to find out? It sounds as though no matter when it would have been announced your husband would still have been upset about it and you would've caused an unnecessary scene.", "YTA. Your sister is correct, your husbands issues are not her problem. Maybe you both should talk to someone to work out the emotional stuff. but it is not fair for you to expect your sister to NOT be able to announce her incoming baby to the family. They are HER parents and family, too.", "YTA. This is your sister's blessing and you two are trying to make it about yourself. Being unable to have children is a personal issue for you and your husband to weigh your options on. The entire world is not obligated to be on pause for you to have a baby.", "YTA. Other people don't have to stop living their lives because of your unfortunate circumstances.  She had every right to announce good news to her whole family at once. While terrible, your misfortune shouldn't change how others act around you. Does your husband run away from every child you see in public? There is absolutely no way that you can avoid dealing with this issue. But it is YOUR issue to deal with. Yours and your husband's. Not the rest of your family's. Not the rest of the world.", "YTA. What did you expect? No one in your family to get pregnant until you do?", "I am leaning for E S H and Y T A.\n\nYou have no right to dictate your sisters pregnancy announcement at her parents house. If her announcement was at an event you were hosting then sure you have a right to be mad, but it wasn't.\n\nBut the real issue is yours and your husband's reaction, i say this in the nicest way possible but you both need therapy. It's not easy having fertility issues but being upset when someone else is pregnant is not healthy at all. Your fertility problems are yours and your husband's problem. People shouldn't have to walk on eggshells around you regarding this topic. The world doesn't revolve around you and people shouldn't be expected have to cater to your problems.\n\nAlthough, since your sister knew about your issues, it would have been nice if she gave you the heads up before or after she announced it to your folks, or did it without you and you husband there. But I don't think that is enough to call her an A H. I mean she could have been trying for a baby for awhile but felt she could never bring it up because of you.\n\nUltimately, YTA by the way you lashed out at your sister and your husband is for walking off.", "YTA", "YTA. She is your sister. Your parents are also her parents. That seems like the perfect place to announce it, supposedly surrounded by those you love and live you. \nYou should be excited for her. \n\nYour situation sucks, but people can't tip toe around you forever, nor put their own lives on hold. That is being selfish.", "YTA.\n\nim sorry for what you and your husband are going through. that\u2019s really shitty that you\u2019ve been trying and still can\u2019t get pregnant. but it\u2019s not like your sister announced this at your birthday or anniversary party. she and her husband are excited for this new addition to their family, and (rightfully) expected her own family to be supportive. your husbands issues *are* his issues. your sister shouldn\u2019t have to tiptoe around the topic. in your eyes, where would the most appropriate place be for her to announce her pregnancy? she didn\u2019t mess up. you did.", "YTA.   You can still be happy for them and handle your sadness on your own.  It\u2019s not a zero sum game. They did nothing wrong and didn\u2019t \u201ctake\u201d anything from you.   Maybe they are hurt too by your responses and actions.", "Yes YTA", "YTA. You can still be happy for others and contain your emotions.", "YTA so let me get this straight. Since you have fertility issues, nobody else around you is allowed to be pregnant or tell about the subject. This IS a you issue. Apologize to your sister and get some therapy for yourself and your husband", "YTA - you are taking away from their own happiness and how they want to break the news to everyone. Your husband also AH, he needs to grow up, put his emotions aside for a bit and learn to be happy for other family members - unless you both don\u2019t expect anyone else to have babies until your IVF works?", "TA definitely, okay it is sad that u and ur husband can't get pregnant. But u and ur husband are very selfish, why can't ur sister be happy about her pregnancy and announce it???  They should be allowed to have all the joyful experience which brings a pregnancy! You and him should apologise for ruined such a important moment in her life!\n\nAnd besides, maybe u should think about other options. There are so many children outside which need a loving family. I work in a children's home, these kids are awesome. Isn't that so important that ur child has ur DNA?", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having trouble conceiving. I went through the same thing. My SIL announced her pregnancy to the family, having fallen pregnant immediately upon trying when we\u2019d been trying for years.\n\nMy husband and I congratulated her, raised a toast and smiled. We hugged and laughed and cooed over the sonogram. We excused ourselves to cry, cuddle and regroup a short time later. Because it wasn\u2019t about us. It was about her, and her husband, and their child (our nephew).", "You aren't the A H for for having an emotional response.  I'm sure that this whole season has been terribly hard for you and your husband.  I don't blame him for leaving the room.  I may have done the same.  I do experience overwhelming emotions and sometimes I need some privacy so that I can respond to people in a loving way.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I called her selfish and cruel  \nI told her she shouldn't have chose my parents house \n\nthat is NOT responding in a loving way.  Being pregnant and announcing a pregnancy is not selfish or cruel.  Her parent's house is a completely appropriate place to share that joyous news.  You of all people should be able to recognize and appreciate what an amazing blessing it is that your sister is pregnant. You should understand that it is something to be celebrated with family.  I understand that your emotions may have been conflicted.  It IS a hard situation and I am not meaning to invalidate that at all.  But it isn't your sister's fault that it is hard, and it is not fair to blame her.  YTA", "YTA- guessing she didn\u2019t get up and say hahaha I\u2019m pregnant and you suckers can\u2019t have kids so there!!!\nBe happy for your sister.", "Sorry, but YTA.", "YTA.  You and your husband are going to have feelings and I'm so sorry for what you are going through but your sister has every right and reason to tell her family at her parents house.  Your reaction was selfish in the extreme.  You both should apologize.", "If you want it so badly adopt, they need loving homes to even if they aren\u2019t connected by blood, secondly what was she supposed to do? Since you have infertility issues she was just supposed to never have kids to make everything \u201cfair\u201d?", "YTA. You and your husband. I get it. I always thought I'd have kids, found out I couldn't almost 8 years ago. I still struggle with it. I've watched people I went to school with have babies. I've watched my sister-in-law have two and my brother-in-law's fiance just had their baby less than a month ago. It's hard. It hurts to hear and it hurts to watch. But that is not their problem. It's not their job to hide their pregnancy and kids from me because I'll cry about it (and I definitely have). It's my job to work through my trauma and accept that my situation and issues aren't everyone else's.\n\nY'all get to be an aunt and uncle. I cannot tell y'all how wonderful that is. You get to have all the fun because you're close to the kids and then don't have to deal with everything that comes with having your own kids. Y'all literally get to be a best friend first and a parental figure second. Both of y'all are being incredibly selfish and need to work through your issues with infertility. Everyone around y'all cannot stop their lives so you don't feel triggered.", "Yta. I\u2019m sorry you and your husband are struggling with infertility, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone else around you can\u2019t live their own lives and get pregnant. I get it, you\u2019re upset she\u2019s pregnant, by why can\u2019t you be happy for your own sister? You have no idea if she has had her own struggles. You can\u2019t expect everyone to keep tiptoeing around and not living their lives all because of the infertility issue. Also, There\u2019s nothing stopping you and your husband from fostering or adopting children. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been looking at, I have PCOS, haven\u2019t really started trying but I know it\u2019ll be hard and looking at all my options whether it be surrogacy or adoption. People around me are getting pregnant, but I don\u2019t storm out of the room all upset and telling everyone they can\u2019t announce it. It\u2019s rude. I rather be happy for them instead of sitting in my pity and angry at the world.", "YTA. I say that as someone who knows the struggle. You should never ruin someone else\u2019s joy over their pregnancy. If you and/or your husband are struggling with your emotions, you should see a counselor. You and your husband should apologize to your sister and your parents.", "YTA - What did you want her to do? It would be a lose-lose for her no matter what she did, it seems like.", "YTA. I'm sorry y'all are having fertility issues, but you can't expect everyone else to avoid sex and pregnancy cause you can't have a baby.", "Location is irrelevant, they could've given you both a heads up but you both need to be okay with others having kids.", "Sorry but YTA.  You shouldn\u2019t have said all that you said, especially in front of others.  I can understand your husband walking away but I don\u2019t think it was as right.  How do you & your husband react when you hear of other friends & family getting pregnant?  Is your husband afraid that he is the infertile person in your relationship?  It\u2019s totally normal & understandable for you & your husband to feel sad, disappointed or even angry that you haven\u2019t had your turn yet.", "YTA. You can\u2019t force everyone around you to not be happy about having children or keeping it to themselves. If you continue this way you will isolate everyone around you. You need to apologise and grow up.", "YTA there are other ways to have children. Ruining this for your sister and her husband was rude and childish. I will say if that was his reaction if you are the one with the issues. I would be prepared for him to ultimately leave you.", "YTA. Just because you and your husband have fertility issues doesn't give you the right to censor other people, especially in someone else's home. What, is nobody else allowed to reproduce and announce it to *their* family just because life dealt you a bad hand? You both couldn't just put on a brave face and celebrate becoming aunt and uncle to your sister's child? Instead, you made her feel bad about expecting. I know it sucks that you and your husband have had such a rough time of TTC, but yeah, A-hole move there by him pouting and walking out, and you throwing insults and causing an argument. Are you even going to acknowledge your niece or nephew when the baby's born?", "\u201cHey I\u2019m so sorry but\u2026the power went out in our house, and I was wondering\u2026could you also shut off your power?

I'm sorry for your fertility issues but she wasn't trying to rub it in.  When exactly would it have been acceptable for her to announce that she's pregnant? Never? Should your niece or nephew be 30 years old and pregnant themselves before you find out that they exist?  You can't expect someone to tiptoe around you for the rest of their lives.

If he cannot handle the simple fact that other people can have kids he needs therapy. His reaction was absolutely over the top. Apologize to your sister. Tell your husband to get help. Move on.", "This might be controversial, but NAH. Of course they have every right to announce the news to family, and probably weren't thinking of you and your husband. Knowing that it might be a difficult subject for you, though, they could have told you privately beforehand to allow you some time to process those feelings before making the more general announcement. No, they shouldn't walk on eggshells, but asking for some sensitivity from your *sister,* not just some random stranger or coworker, doesn't seem out of line.", "YTA do you not realize that other people have a right to be happy. You don\u2019t have a baby so no one else is allowed to?", "YTA. While your infertility is unfortunate, you should still be happy for others if they can.

The world does not revolve around you and your husband.", "YTA. OP, you can't identify a logical alternative because there is none. This is because you're not acting reasonably.

Understandably, you're reacting from a place of pain.", "YTA\n\nI feel for your situation, and I know how it must hurt so much to hear that others are adding to their family while you want to so much but cannot.\n\nThe answer isn't to rage at everyone who gets pregnant.

Your husbands needs to grow up big time as well.", "ESH, but leaning more towards YTA. \n\nThat\u2019s a moment your sister is allowed to celebrate on her terms with her parents. Yes, she could\u2019ve handled it a bit more sensitively by, maybe, telling you two ahead of time so you weren\u2019t blindsided\u2026 but she didn\u2019t have to do that. This is an important moment for her, and your fertility issues are not her fault. She should be allowed to have that moment, especially if it truly wasn\u2019t meant to be done maliciously. If anything, she didn\u2019t want you to feel left out as she told the family. \n\nThe way you and your husband acted was selfish.

Those things can all coexist.  I am sorry it is not easy.", "Well she\u2019s the one who said her husband never got the chance to be a father.

Still, as hurt as OP and her husband were, OP has no business telling her sister she couldn't announce her pregnancy at a family gathering at the parents' house. She should have just excused herself and left with her husband.", "Agreed, a heads up would have blunted the blow to the OP and her husband.", "Exactly what I was thinking.

There was no reason to spring it on them like that; under normal circumstances it was a perfectly reasonable thing to do, but given all they've been through, come on.

In my opinion your second sentence should say the sister COULD have given up advance notice, as that would have been the kind thing to do. But she didn't have to, it isn't a 'should' have thing. She might have thought from previous interactions with op that a private disclosure would have been even worse and a bigger deal vs not singling her out and simply telling everyone all at once. She doesn't actually owe op a private announcement, she shared her news the way she felt the best about it.\n\nEdit: Definitely agree with how you describe what op should have done", "She's supposed to let them know that she was going to tell them that she was pregnant? \n\nYou really only need to tell people the once and it wasn't made a big thing.", "Yep they could have handled the announcement better for sure.

That explosion is why I think OP was the AH in the situation.", "I mean it was fairly private? It was just them and their parents - immediate family only. I get not telling them at a big party but I would think immediate family wouldn\u2019t need to be separated.\n\nIf I was telling big news to my family, I wouldn\u2019t think to separately tell my mom from my sister, especially if we had a plan to have dinner together soon.", "Cool story, doesn\u2019t mean that she gets to crap on everyone else having kids", "You seem very upset by me. There is no need to engage with me if it\u2019s not a safe space for you. \n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nGonna edit here - I blocked this dude when he, invariably, regressed to pulling out the old  \u201cdemocrats started the kkk\u201d song and dance. \nEngage at your own risk \u2764\ufe0f", "It may if sister knew OP would ruin the surprise before she had a chance to announce herself. \n\nI agree, giving people suffering with infertility a heads up is the right thing to do.

She should get to enjoy those moments. \n\nBased on OPs reactions and that she\u2019s here asking is kinda telling and makes me think that maybe the case.

However, she texted me instead of calling (so that I had space to process) and told me first. Because she knew I'd be happy for her but also knew that I'd have complicated feelings about it all. Then when she told the whole family, I was mentally braced and genuinely so happy for her. \n\nIt sounds like OP is incredibly bitter in general that her sister is pregnant at all (not just about the announcement) and the sister also sounds like she's possibly being unnecessarily cruel (\"can't walk on eggshells\" remark). So I definitely think ESH is the right move.", "I'm reluctant to call a dinner at home with close family members a public announcement.", "The fact remains that OP and husband are still going to find out.

Maybe they can't just get together with the rest of the family whenever they all want to. \n\nI'm not sure why everyone seems to think that OP and the husband should be the only ones whose feelings are considered. No one is saying that they had to hug and squeal and congratulations. All they had to do was not be asses and yes, ruin the time for everyone. It sucks they can't conceive or are having issues but other people are still allowed to experience happiness related to children, even when they're around.", "Not so super obvious. That's good news and OP and her husband should have been happy for them. Their extremely negative reaction was uncalled for. Their inability to conceive so far is sad, but it doesn't mean that other people have to treat their pregnancies like bad news. \n\nIts not like they were rubbing it in their face, they just announced a pregnancy at a small family dinner. It had nothing to with OP/OP's husband infertility, but they decided to make it about them.\n\nOP is an AH.", "I feel like announcing it with only their family present, in their parents house is somewhat private. It doesn't sound like they did anything special, that this was already a set family dinner. That should have been more than enough", "Nah, they don't need to walk on eggshells. Op and her husband are grown ups, they should be able to handle the fact that sometimes other people are gonna have kids. I actually think it's selfish and weird to react with anger when something nice happens to someone else. I struggled with fertility issues too and encountered pregnant people at my job all the time. Didn't bother me in the least.", "Because everything isn't about OP and her husband. Yes, it sucks they're having trouble conceiving. But the sister is right- she shouldn't have to walk on eggshells her entire life and think about how her every action might upset OP and husband. OP is an TA because she absolutely did make the sister's announcement all about her, her issues and how upset they were.\n\nIt's always going to be this way. The world doesn't stop because you have issues. She's complaining about the sister being insensitive and was just as insensitive- she didn't consider her sister at all when bitching her out, only how she and her husband felt.", "If someone\u2019s happiness is upsetting to you, that\u2019s your issue, not theirs.

Most people I know say they like being told privately ahead of firm so they\u2019re prepared and can process the news alone. A friend did this to me when she told me she was pregnant soon after a miscarriage; I was so happy for her but really upset for myself and that we wouldn\u2019t have babies at the same time, and I kind of cried at home and then was really happy with her in person. I really appreciated the warning. I\u2019d rate this ESH because OP\u2019s reaction does come across really self centered and expresses no happiness for her sister, but infertility is hard for everyone (men included), and it isn\u2019t hard to shoot a text message and give warning so people can process their feelings alone and not have to walk out.", "You know this wouldnt have ended well either.

Never did I ever expect someone to withhold their joy because of my struggles.", "I was younger than high school, I might have been 12 or 13.

When I was struggling with fertility, and was going to a party my sister was hosting, she told beforehand that her super pregnant friend would be there. I didn\u2019t care either way, but I appreciated the heads up so I could decide if I wanted to come. Sometimes when you are in the middle of it- the shots, the blood work, the super invasive testing, and ultrasounds, it can be incredibly hard to feel joy for others. Jealousy is never pretty, but I think a private heads up, so her sister could do what she needed to do to have an appropriate public reaction is warranted.", "It\u2019s the kind of thing OP should deal with in therapy. It\u2019s a major struggle, infertility. But people aren\u2019t going to stop having kids just because you want them and can\u2019t have them. Both OP and her husband should be in therapy to learn how to cope with that fact, not taking it out on people just living their lives. Her sister could\u2019ve told them beforehand but she doesn\u2019t _have_ to. \n\nBut yeah. Therapy is probably a very good idea if neither of them can take it. You cannot expect the world to cater to your feelings. Sometimes that\u2019s because people truly are assholes, sometimes that\u2019s because people are careless and don\u2019t think of other ways of handling it and accidentally do something insensitive (imo where OP\u2019s sister falls, because she could\u2019ve given them a heads up, but she didn\u2019t have to and I don\u2019t think that she was trying to be malicious), and sometimes just because pregnant people and babies and children etc exist. Unless you\u2019re gonna become a hermit in the woods you cannot avoid that, but you can learn how to function with it. \n\nI am coming from the position of also having found out that at the best if I managed to get pregnant I would have a pregnancy extremely high risk for me and any baby, at worst (and most likely) unable to conceive in the first place. So I say that without any privilege compared to OP or lack of understanding, and as someone who is in therapy.\n\nETA: my ruling here is still YTA because yeah it\u2019s _close_ to ESH but I don\u2019t think her sister meant any harm, and she can one and done it if she wants.", "This one. This is why OP is YTA.

I think if sis had given them a head's up, they prob wouldn't have even shown up to dinner OR woudl've ruined the secret with their fertility complaints to the other fam members.  \n\n\nIt sucks b/c sis is honestly in a rock and a hard place.

I just know too many people who would do exactly that", "Thank you! While I agree OP handled it badly, the husband absolutely gets a pass in my book.  He got up and walked out.  What the heck else was he supposed to do?  I know that pain. Guarantee he walked out so that he wouldn't ugly cry in front of everyone.  When I was dealing with infertility and those feelings were still raw, I excused myself to the bathroom on more than one occasion to avoid breaking down in front of people. I didn't want to be a Debbie downer. (In my case, it was easier, because those were mostly work scenarios, and I kept my infertility to myself so nobody realized I was even upset - they probably thought I had IBS or something).\n\nBut damn. You can't FORCE yourself to be happy when you've been blindsided and your heart is breaking.  All you can do is go have your cry, splash cold water on your face, and come back when you're ready to put on the happy, congratulatory expression  you know such an announcement warrants.  And I really was happy for them! It's perfectly possible to be happy for someone else and sad for yourself at the same time.\n\nEmotions gonna emotion.\n\nThe fact that their situation has been going on for years may actually have made it worse.

Then they should have waited a week for op to talk it over and tell everyone she felt like telling...\n\nAnd then sister would be allowed to tell her own parents.", "Nope. Sister thinks she has the right to all the issues and undying support.", "That is speculation - I can't see anything in this post where OP says its 'unfair'.

At least OP whining to family would be in character.", "YTA but she could've potentially handled it better.

If you had a miracle baby, you would be overjoyed. Show her the love you would want shown to you, even if you need to take breaks to handle your emotions. \n\n\n\nYou are dealing with something very heavy.

This would be jarring and inconsiderate of her, because she\u2019s shoving my former hobby in my face. It\u2019s not her lifelong hobby, and she could have shared the pictures somewhere I wasn\u2019t a captive audience. \n\nBut a baby just isn\u2019t the same. It\u2019s a new life, not a new hobby.

Ideally, he should have wished them well and then stepped out if he didn\u2019t feel able to meet their energy. Practically, it\u2019s fine that he was too upset to do this! But if you felt able to explain more, then you should have said \u201che\u2019s been having a really hard time around this topic lately, and probably wasn\u2019t sure how to react right now - please enjoy your evening and we\u2019ll celebrate with you when we can!\u201d and then left to support him.

You both can still be happy for others and congratulate them.  And where else should they have announced it?  When and where would it have made a difference?

That said, at no point would I consider OP to not be in the wrong. \nLooking at this from a lot of points of view, the sister is not obligated to tell OP first, and it\u2019s not fair for OP and hubby\u2019s issues to dictate who and how sis gets to share her life news. Could they have given a heads up? Sure. Should they? Depends on many factors. In my experience, people wish to share the news first with loved ones who will be supportive. I don\u2019t get the impression OP or her hubby will be a good support system through pregnancy. \nLikewise, if sister told the family except the OP and hubby, then there\u2019s a huge risk of resentment over being excluded. \n\nUltimately, OP, YTA\n\nAs someone who has dealt with infertility, your husband\u2019s reaction is not healthy.

I was diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disease as a child. My parents were always about us only doing things if both could do it. That meant when I got sick and could no longer do the things I could do before my sister couldn't either. I always hated this as I felt my sister was unable to enjoy her childhood because of me.\n\nI knew then that I would likely never have kids. My doctor was always very honest about how my illness would affect my ability to have children. I was nine years old. My sister knew this too. She grew up saying she didn't want kids. I honestly can't say if she said it because it was true or if she said it because she knew I likely couldn't. She knew everything always had to be \"fair\" between us.\n\nGuess what? She got pregnant anyway. I didn't get pissed off. I didn't tell her to shut up about it,  get angry at her now ex or my parents for being happy. I can't even imagine thinking I was entitled to take that joy from my sister. \n\nOur pain does not give us the right to take the joy of a moment from someone else. My relationship with my sister and my nephews is ultimately more important than mourning the what might have been.\n\nYTA Op. Your husband walked out. You could have made up an excuse and left without causing an issue. Instead, you destroyed a moment of joy for your family because for that moment they weren't thinking of your pain.

I get the feeling that the husband is hypersensitive about being infertile, which is why he immediately walked out of the house.  I think the sister feels like she has been very patient and \"walked on eggshells\" for so long, and that they could finally after 5 years, be pregnant without having to hide it.\n\nI also like how OP says her sister \"shouldn't have chosen my parents house\" when it is also the sister's parents house.  Why wouldn't you announce your pregnancy at your parents dinner table?", "I\u2019m going to disagree bc OP never said they were upset about not being given a heads up. They are upset that they announced it at their parents house while they were present. That means OP and her husband are unreasonable, blinded by their grief and making everyone pay for it. So, do you think two people who behave this way are going to act right if they were given a heads up. No, they wouldn\u2019t, and I bet the sister knew that. They would have blown up in some way, and ruined the announcement before the dinner. Damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.

When is OP\u2019s sister allowed to have a moment of celebratory joy with family without feeling the need to walk on eggshells? OP\u2019s sister having a baby does not take anything away from her sister. She\u2019s not stealing her sisters spotlight by announcing a pregnancy at OP\u2019s wedding day or disrespecting a tragic loss by announcing it on the day OP experienced a miscarriage? Or does she have to wait perpetually until OP conceives and has a child herself before she can surprise her family and share good news?

Unless you explicitly told your sister not only how hard it was to not to be able to conceive, but also how hard it was hearing others talk about their pregnancies, then maybe you could suppose having your sister pull you aside and giving you a heads up would be more appropriate. However unless you specifically told her this, you can\u2019t expect her to read your mind! Let go of your unrealistic unclaimed expectations and start being happy for having a niece/nephew in your life, who may be able to fulfill more of that love lost than you even your self expect. \n\nMisery may love company, but every child deserves love and support from their family.", "Imo if the OP had suffered a loss of an infant/miscarriage fairly recently then I kinda understand being upset by pregnancy announcement....but that is the only case where I could see OPs perspective.

What's he going to do when the kid is born? Not visit anymore? He needs to deal with this in a healthy way.", "Or maybe she'd be spiteful and tell people. Or call parents. We have no context.  She wasn't owed a heads up", "Exactly!!

The idea that you would LEAVE YOUR SISTER\u2019S PREGNANCY ANNOUNCEMENT because *it\u2019s not fair, she knows I can\u2019t get pregnant and how dare she* is one of the most selfish things I\u2019ve ever heard.

A private heads up would still upset the husband and then they would probably ruin the surprise for the rest of the family.

This is why it\u2019s important to process trauma before having children, to avoid passing down dysfunctional behavior to future generations. Your parents are also tired of your, BS, and, if you aren\u2019t careful with respect to your sister, you may find yourself increasingly excluded in coming years as they won\u2019t alienate a daughter and grandchild to spare your misplaced feelings. Get help.", "But why does her sister have to tiptoe around OP over how she loves her own life? It's sister's pregnancy and sister's parents. This was a very natural situation to make a happy announcement and she shouldn't have to subtract from her own joy because of OP\u2019s difficulties. OP can\u2019t give her sister a minute to be happy?", "There's unfortunately a lot of entitlement and narcissim that festers in online infertility support forums, which OP may be a part of.\n\nMy best friend's SIL has struggled with infertility and pregnancy loss. She ended up leaving all the forums she initially joined and going to real counseling because too many people in the forums used their infertility as an excuse for egregious behavior.", "Respectfully, I disagree. Grief can manifest in many different ways for different people, or even different ways for the same person with different losses. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all grief package. And as someone who also received grief counseling for infertility, my therapist spent a good deal of time working with me on exactly things like this situation OP found herself in. And although I agree it was not handled well, grief can make it hard for someone to see things clearly. \n\nFor the OP, I say soft YTA. You are in a hard season of life, and it\u2019s very painful to go through it. I know. I\u2019ve dealt with infertility for years. Every announcement feels like a dagger to the heart and maybe even more-so from those closest to us. But your feelings are not your sister\u2019s responsibility. She has a right to be happy and to share her happy news with the family. Would it have been a divine kindness to give you a private heads-up beforehand? Definitely. But as compassionate as that would be, it\u2019s not a requirement. We can\u2019t expect everyone else in the world to dampen their joy around our pain (though I admit I might prefer it). And I\u2019m sure you love your sister and want her to be happy and have good things happen. Focus on that, if it\u2019s true. \n\nApologize to your sister, let her have her moment of joy, and then find time to yourself to privately cry it out over a pint of Ben & Jerry\u2019s or whatever helps you work through the painful feelings of going through this because it really does hurt and it sucks more than most people understand.", "I completely agree. I had a cousin have a surprise pregnancy two weeks after I was told by the obgyn that neither of my ovaries seemed to be ovulating. I hugged her and told her how happy I was and then went home and cried.", "I would say walking out is still causing a scene.  If he can\u2019t put on a brave face and be sad about it later, he does probably need some therapy.  I say this as someone who miscarried my last-chance baby last year.  Hearing about babies and pregnancy is like a knife to my heart but I can put a brave face on it and not ruin someone else\u2019s moment.", "OP and hubby have been struggling for five years too. If neither of them have the coping skills to deal with this for long enough to fake being happy for immediate family for a minute or two before excusing themselves they have much, much bigger issues.\n\nThey didn't recently have a miscarriage that OP mentions and if they've been doing failed IVF or something for years their doctor sucks if they've continued the process for this long on with clearly unstable couple. Being upset you didn't get a head-ups on the announcement feels like being annoyed that someone talks about their deceased family members because your grandma died before theirs and obviously they should know it upsets you.", "And that kind of selfishness goes along with the attitude.", "I wonder if OP and her husband realize that if they're that far gone, that they, especially hubby, likely need some mental health assistance.", "We don't even know if it blindsided them, to be fair.  Yes, it might have been completely out of the blue, but equally, OP and hubby may have been fully aware that they had been trying and that a pregnancy soon was a definite possibility or even a probability.  \n\nNotice how OP doesn't give any info at all about sister's attempts to start a family (or not) - I'm leaning towards OP being fully aware that it was a possibility.  Also that sister mentions being tired of walking around on eggshells - they probably 'haven't been allowed' to talk about their own efforts/struggles any time hubby is around.  Add in that Mom asked OP to leave, not sister, and that starts to fill out the picture.\n\nI do agree that a private heads up would have been kinder than just announcing at a family dinner, if only because then OP and hubby could have had a meltdown at home rather than at a family dinner and making everyone uncomfortable.", "The in-laws are clearly over this rampaging husband.", "Her calling it \"my parents house\" is very telling of how entitled of a person OP truly is. Sounds like this couple has a way of making everything about themselves with zero regard to how others feel. Both OP and her husband are massive AH's.", ">Why wouldn't you announce your pregnancy at your parents dinner table?\n\nExactly. This seems like a normal place to do this. I mean, it would be super inappropriate if the sister made the announcement at OP's house or something. Then OP may have a leg to stand on. But the parents house is shared neutral territory as far as I'm concerned.", "And being pregnant is a happy occasion for many. What better place and time to declare it than a family gathering?\n\nDoes OP's husband storm out of the room every time someone tells him that they are pregnant/expecting a baby? Dude needs to grow up and lose his main character syndrome.", "I'm pretty sure op would have been even more devastated if her whole family got together without her and her husband and celebrated the sister's pregnancy.", "But why? Sister should be able to enjoy the act of telling the family.  It's a fun thing to reveal.", "Considering she ruined her pregnancy announcement and called her cruel for simply sharing the news I\u2019m definitely leaning towards the former", "It\u2019ll be weird too if she told OP first. Had she told OP first, wouldn\u2019t OP get mad that her sister is flaunting the pregnancy deliberately?", "Thank you for your perspective.", "Yeah, while the sister could have said something, the walking on eggshells comment makes me think that addressing it privately would have been just as bad if not worse. You announce something like that with others and sometimes you just hope the other party has their shit together enough to keep their feelings to themselves, which OP and husband were unable to do.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t announce it at your wedding or your husband\u2019s birthday. She didn\u2019t give you a onesie saying \u201cworld\u2019s greatest aunt\u201d as a way of telling the family. She told her parents in their home. Her life doesn\u2019t revolve around you and your issues. She\u2019s allowed to live her life. It\u2019s one thing to be sad that it\u2019s not happening for you, but you don\u2019t throw tantrums because it is happening for your siblings.", "How selfish of her to make it all about herself and the sensitive husband.  Can't they just be happy for the sister?", "So, my uncle and his wife were infertile. They tried for babies for years, just like you guys.\n\nI loved my uncle as a baby and toddler - all the photos are of me laughing with delight, riding around on his back like a pony, he was apparently really good with kids. Funny guy, full of joy and just a really bright light from what I'm told.\n\nInstead of joining in, my aunt got increasingly bitter. She wouldn't show up for anything, would skip Christmas, Thanksgiving, and eventually, my uncle, even though he was sad about it, let her get to him, and he stopped showing up too. She said it was too \"hard for her.\"\n\nIt wrecked a once close relationship between him and my mom, and his wife, to my understanding, is a miserable, lonely, bitter woman who never leaves the house anymore. She's apparently a miserable wife too.\n\nMy uncle, around my 12th or 13th birthday, apparently called my mom. He wanted to be involved in my birthday celebration, wanted to take me out for the day. I had no idea who this guy was - I barely knew him. He stopped coming around when I was a toddler. I was a young teen, and had no interest in doing anything with him. He cried when my mom explained that he missed his chance to be close with my sister and I.\n\nHe seems like quite a sad guy now, has a lot of regrets. I still don't know him really, probably seen him under 8-9 times in my entire adult life. He apparently tells my mom all the time how much he regrets letting that relationship fall apart. To give this some context, this is 32 years later.\n\nSo who do you guys want to be? The aunt and uncle who can be a part of a family, share in joy, give horsie rides, go to birthdays... or the kind that stomp out and rain on other people's good news?\n\nI know you guys are upset, but look beyond your own self pity here, and apologize. You need to (and I know this sounds harsh) get over and come to terms with your infertility. You cannot rob other people of their joy. Try to be involved with nieces and nephews instead of being poisoned by envy, I promise you your lives will be better for it.\n\nYTA.", "Why couldn't your husband say congrats and move on?", "So your husband had a temper tantrum because he can\u2019t have something he wants? Congrats you got your baby.", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nI use a wheelchair. It would be patently *unfuckinghinged* for me to expect anyone to text me a heads up that they would be using their legs to walk into my house. It would be shitty for me to expect everyone else to take the ravaging, terrible medications I have to take. It would be terrible of me to throw a fit when other people show photos or videos *they got to take for themselves* at their children's important events instead of asking someone else to film it because I can't go. None of that would be ok, so let's reframe the actions of this couple if you're one of the approximately half of commenters inclined to defend them.\n\nWhen something goes awry for someone, they don't get to turn around and demand that everyone else either be as unfortunate as themselves, or walk on eggshells and pretend they are that unfortunate, or at the very least dampen their own joy and relationships to make the less fortunate person feel better.\n\nBasically, OP and the husband need to grow up. There are zero other medical situations where it would be acceptable to make everyone else follow selfish, egotistical instructions on when, how, and where they are allowed to be happy, and *no, this situation is not different or an exception.* Oh, but they can't have kids! Ok, and? Right this second, people are dying of end-stage illnesses, people are fighting to survive famine and drought, people are being thrown into illegal mass graves in a genocidal war as we all debate the ego of one infertile couple. Should everyone else not celebrate peace and togetherness this holiday season, or have birthdays, or toast to good health, lest anyone anywhere be upset at the good fortune of others?\n\nI have been dealt a fucked up hand, health wise, and not once have I wished that everyone I love was in the same boat so that I wouldn't have to go to therapy and save my tears for an appropriate setting. Emotional maturity is waiting for the correct time and place to lose your shit about how fucked up and unfair your predicament is. \n\nWe can't take the specific medical misfortune of inferility, raise it above all others- including terminal illness- and say that this one group gets to dictate when and how everyone else in the entire world gets to celebrate their own joyous moments because they get sad but are somehow excused from the expectation of emotional maturity we enforce on literally everyone else. As someone who has dealt with medical shit and pregnancy losses, *****THAT ISN'T HOW LIFE WORKS.***** Imagine people on hospice throwing fits at a child's birthday party, or the disabled suddenly grabbing everyone's attention, crying and storming out when able-bodied people enter the building or room. You'd think people had lost their fucking minds, and rightfully so. Why is infertility different? Were they were *owed* an entire separate human just because they wanted one? People who feel that they are owed children and flip their shit when it doesn't happen for them are *creepy.* Those parents end up on JustNo and no-contact subreddits as the subject because they didn't ever see their children as separate people, but as either extensions of themselves or as property they owned by merit of birthing and paying their legally enforceable responsibility to the child's personal needs until adulthood. It's fine to be upset and grieve the loss of potential parenthood, but once it becomes anyone else's burden to carry because you won't pick your own baggage up and *carry it your own damn self*, you've crossed over into the world of creepy weirdos that think kids are trophies to show off and not entire little people with the inalienable right of autonomy. \n\nThis has now gone on too long and revealed entirely too much personal business, but I hope it helps it finally sink in to people defending OP that the world doesn't owe infertile people special treatment or the expectation that others will give them endless special consideration and make them a priority in every single thing regardless of how little it has to do with them *at all* so that they don't have to go work on themselves and treat everyone else with empathy and respect. Also, *no one is owed children* and that entire concept needs to melt in the dumpster fire of our current society restructuring. Infertility isn't a free pass to be an entitled asshole to anyone else.", "Lol, 19 years later ...\n\nWho is this guy?\n\nHe's our son.  Just graduated from HS.\n\nHOW COME WE'VE NEVER MET HIM!?\n\nWell, you and your husband were pretty weird about the whole being infertile thing ...", "THIS. I'd understand if OP and her hubby had just found out they were infertile. But its been about 6 years. Plenty of time to work through this horrible event. I'm sure they may always feel sadness, but its important to learn to put those aside and be happy for others. YTA.", "Agree with YTA. I had trouble getting pregnant for years, and the couple times during these years someone close announced their pregnancy, I was genuinely happy for them. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how some people\u2019s struggles make it impossible for them to accept that other people don\u2019t face the same challenges. This is called LIFE, and people are not going to stop having a life to spare someone\u2019s feelings.", "Hugs for you and appreciation for your understanding. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95", "This omg. Actually the perfect setting.", "But it is not clear that it was a \"big public announcement\"; OP only stated dinner with family. Plus, it is the sister's parents as well AND the grandparents of the child. Where else should they announce it???", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I had a very similar situation. My sister gave birth to my niece 3 weeks after I lost my son at 39wks. I still showed up at the hospital and supported her and held the baby. I was so happy for her even though I just wanted to die. OP can\u2019t take people\u2019s joy away just because she is miserable about her own situation. I held many babies and congratulated many new parents before I held another baby of my own. I had to swallow the lump in my throat every time but it\u2019s just what you have to do.", "So devestating about your precious baby. Very generous and brave that you could still show happiness for your sister. That baby\u2019s very lucky to have you as an auntie \u2764\ufe0f", "And this ladies and gentlemen is how real families should act.  Sorry for your loss.  That text you sent your sister in law made you a class act.\ud83c\udfc6", "Yeah, I do think that while OP and her husband may not have actually thought this, it was subconsciously what they were hoping for. This is the reason they got so upset and husband freaked out. SMH.

He didn't just quietly excuse himself.  He caused a scene.", "You'd think pregnancy announcements can only happen inside of a confession booth at the nearest Catholic church, the way people are going on. It's such coddling, unnecessarily infantilizing bullshit. Adults dealt shit hands in life are not entitled to ruin everyone else's joy.", "It shouldn\u2019t be though! All I did was be honest with her and basically laid out my needs- \u201cI still need to be included in our family, I just need a little grace right now,\u201d and she was so happy to give me what I needed and totally understood. \n\nOP could have done the same thing: \u201cSister, I\u2019m so happy for you and I love you, but I need a little space to process this, because it hurts that you have what I want. I will be in touch.\u201d", "I am so, so sorry for your loss. You\u2019re good people.", "Thank you- it was the worst experience of my life, but it wasn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s fault. And honestly, the last thing that a new mom needs is to be worried about is someone else\u2019s feelings.", "A few years ago I broke up with my boyfriend because he didn\u2019t want to marry me. The same day that I told my mom, she quietly told me that my brother was going to propose to his girlfriend that week. I was so glad that she told me, because it gave me time to get all my grief out before he told me himself, so I could focus on being happy for him when he told me. Him getting engaged had nothing to do with me not being engaged, but it still brought out the emotions of my loss.Everyone was sensitive to the needs of the rest of the family, and allowed us to all feel sad for me while being happy for him. \nNo one \u201cowes\u201d anyone anything, I guess, but what kind of people don\u2019t want to bring the maximum amount of joy and support to people they love, and allow the appropriate time for both?", "Exactly. In the world of infertility, giving a private advanced notice is being considerate. It gives you a choice of not participating in the big announcement. Unless you\u2019re going through the struggle, you have no idea how painful it is for someone who can\u2019t conceive. But with that said, I probably would\u2019ve just left while simultaneously bawling my eyes out.", "OP NTA\n\nThis \u2b06\ufe0f\n\nSis could have sent OP an email or a text in advance and give them a choice about how to proceed. \n\nI get that it's challenging to move forward joyfully when family is dealing w infertility. \n\nBut this smacks of sister feeling entitled to have EVERYONE hear their news, sis & BIL pain be damned.\n\nI'm sorry your family can't have compassion for you and your husband and joy for your sister & her hub.", "This one is it. It sucks when life gives you lemons, but you/they/other people can be happy for others\u2019 good fortunes because that\u2019s what a loving supporting family does. I\u2019ve never understood the \u201chey I can\u2019t have kids so the world can\u2019t talk about them.\u201d", "My guess is this isn\u2019t the only issue the family has to walk on eggshells about. He probably makes the family feel like he needs to be treated with kid gloves b/c he over reacts regularly.", "This !! \n\nShe\u2019s announcing to family the soon he be grandparents and aunt/uncle but I guess the sister shouldn\u2019t announce anything bc op is the only one who can do what she wants", "Agreed 100%. Sorry OP. YTA. While this is an issue for you and your husband, try to be happy for your sister.", "This !

And how can giving news to your family that they don't know yet be anything but a surprise? If I sit down to dinner with my family and say \"oh by the way, I got offered a new job today!\" is that a \"surprise public announcement\"? This was a private family conversation, and it doesn't sound like any method of delivery would have gone over well with OP or her husband.", "I have a good friend who talked a lot about how he and his wife felt like they couldn't celebrate their first pregnancy bc her best friend had fertility issues. And he felt for the friend, but he just wanted his wife to be giddy about their baby.\n\nI've known a few other folks that felt that way over the years, but I'll never forget him talking about how it went from super happy to tons of eggshells to not offend their friend.\n\nSo yeah, there have been times I've wanted to be bitter or jealous myself, but I've never wanted to shit on someone's joy like that. I think about how he talked about it a lot when I want to get jealous, and it makes it easier for me to let go and focus on being truly happy for someone else.", "If the sister would have told OP beforehand OP would have asked her to not tell the family, not have a baby shower,  and not bring the baby around after it's born I bet \ud83d\ude2c", "I think we all understand the husband\u2019s feelings and the sister has heard it for 5 years. That\u2019s really patient IMO. It\u2019s a happy occasion for the expectant parents.

So are we!\nAn apology is due. You and your husband could have been the Cool Aunt/Uncle.", "I\u2019m sure she would.", "I don\u00b4t think this is the same thing, OP\u00b4s sister was trying to share her happy moment with the whole family at the same time, not trying to harm her in any way", "Since you have infertility issues and it has been really difficult for you, can you explain to me why she should have given her sister a heads up before she told her mom? Who's to say she is closer to her sister than her mother? I would never want to be in a situation where my sister could possibly tell my mom my good news, I am much closer to my mother than my sister. I could see giving the sister a heads up if she was going to an announcement party at her parents, but that was not the case. And I can't imagine that you ever stop grieving not being able to have children, and I can understand why right after having a miscarriage or finding out you're not pregnant again you might have to excuse yourself from the table and leave a large gathering, but after 5 years of trying to have kids unsuccessfully is it unreasonable for the sister to have hoped her parents AND sister/sister's SO could finally be happy for her? The sister said she was tired of walking on eggshells and that tells me she may have already waited to get pregnant for some time. How long would be long enough to not be an AH in this situation? Or is it inevitable that you will always come off as somewhat of an AH when you get pregnant and someone close to you is experiencing infertility issues? What is the best way for you and your family to get to experience your full joy and still accommodate someone very close to you who cannot be happy for you?", "And announcing privately just means you have to look them in the face and handle the blow that it is one on one. Having a group announcement is better because you can usually hide behind the other\u2019s Happy responses while you swallow your tears and put on your pretend smile and congratulate them. Then bawl your eyes out together in the car on the way home. \n\nSister shouldn\u2019t be tied to announcing to OP and Husband first and having the first announcement get such a negative response. She is allowed to have her moment how she wants it instead of being forced to start out with a guilt trip from sister."]}
