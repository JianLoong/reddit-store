I think it would have been a nice gesture, to be sure. Sounds like Jack is a great father to you. \n\nI would just sit down with him again and tell him how much he means to you. I'm sure Jack will get over it, but if I was in his shoes I'd be pretty hurt. If he were gone tomorrow, what would you regret not saying to him? \n\nAs an aside, having just been married myself, you can't win it all. There's always someone with hurt feelings who wasn't invited, or in the wedding party, or w/e. If it wasn't Jack, it would have been something else. Give yourself some grace.", "NTA\n\nThere is a lot of nuance to the situation, but I don\u2019t read that you actively tried to hurt him. \n\nWould it have been a nice gesture? Yea, probably.", "You aren't the asshole here, but you are related to some people who should have mentioned something to you.", "NTA. Jack sounds like he handed it well in the end.", "NTA it is an antiquated and super sexist tradition.", "NTA\n\nThe idea a man escorts a woman to her husband and \"gives\" her away\" is antiquated at best and misogynistic at worst. It's rooted in making sure the bride didn't run away before the ceremony.", "NTA.  They could have asked you directly instead of the hinting.", "NTA, it\u2019s your wedding and your choice", "NTA. He seems cool with it. Your mother is TA pushing this. Sounds like SD raised you to be an independent, self reliant woman who didn't need to be \"given away\" like property to your husband. The custom is patriarchal and unnecessary. \n\nDon't give it another thought.", "A reminder to those commenting ESH and YTA, walking the bride down the aisle is based on the notion that a woman is property and she is being \"handed\" over to the man by the father. I get it's tradition, but maybe it's time to rethink that one. \n\nWith that out of the way, his feelings are probably hurt. Maybe making a point to take him out for a special date just the two of you to let him know how special he is to you. \n\nNAH, I get why he is upset, but you can't know something no one will tell you.", "Since you actually feel bad about it, NTA. Just sounds like a lack of communication.", "NTA. You just didn't think of it, for the reasons you stated. Just show him how much you appreciate him by planning something special for him that he would enjoy.", "NTA\n\nThis tradition is outdated. You\u2019re not property to be given away. Step dad is a big baby.", "soft ESH - You could have been more thoughtful toward the person that raised you since you were 6, and you say were always there for you and was a good substitute father figure in your life. I also don't see how they throwed multiple hints to you and you were completely oblivious until they pointed it out to you, and all of a sudden you thought back and could remember them. If you could remember them months later they were obvious enough for you to catch them then. I could  see how your step-father might not have wanted to approach you about it because he already felt you didn't want him to do it, so he didn't want to push you or put you on the spot by asking. And ultimately he was disappointed but not mad and you would have never known if it were for you mom and bro, so I don't think he acted inappropriately.\n\nBUT your mom and bro suck because they could have just had a straight forward conversation with you about it, instead of holding it in for months and then being mad at your afterwards. Instead of hinting multiple times they could have just had said hey IDK if you know but Jack was looking forward to walking you down the aisle. Is that something that you might consider doing? We know it's your wedding and your decision, but we just wanted to have you aware that it was something he was looking forward to. \n\nIt really could have been that simple.", "ESH. Sounds like you all have a problem with communication. You are entitled to walk yourself down the aisle, but it isn't a big leap to think that if \"most\" people are accompanied, your stepdad may have hoped to be asked. You could have mentioned your plans. By the same token, if your Stepdad wanted to offer his services, he and your mum should have used their words and offered rather than dropping hints and hoping you'd pick up on them.", "NTA but it seems that would have been the thing to do.  Of course, someone should have directly asked you if you would consider this.  It is done now, and they need to realize communication should have happened, not little hints.", "NTA, but it begs the question, why didnt you ask your father figure to walk you down the aisle? seems calloused to me if you call someone your father figure and then not consider them for it. Cultures differ and vary so I may be way off base. Either way if it was that big of a deal tell them to stop hinting and just grow some balls next time lol come out right and say it. Clearly your family can communicate fairly decently", "NAH. It was your choice and you had the right to make it. Since most brides are escorted down the aisle in your country, it would have been nice if you  had this conversation with your stepdad before the wedding. Since he has such a great father figure to you, he deserved the assurance that your decision had nothing to do with your feelings towards him and it shouldn\u2019t have taken a confrontation from your mom to convince you to do that.", "Eh, you kind of are. Your stepfather was a very honorable man to you. It takes a special person to raise children that aren't his. It would be best if you had given him the respect of walking you down the aisle.", " NTA - I would take jack out for a dad/daughter date and then say you really did not mean to hurt his feelings or make him feel any less than a father in your life. It was an oversight and that you didn\u2019t to it maliciously and love him like a dad. Just reaffirm his role in your life.", "Did nobody walk you down the aisle? I figure that if you both skipped that tradition entirely, that'd be just fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if *he* was walked by his mother and you were walked by nobody or by someone else, I can see why the family is upset. And since you say that they kept hinting that Jack should be the one to walk you, I have to assume on of those things is true.\n\nThe guy helped raise you from a pretty young age and you asked someone else? Asked nobody and walked out alone? You don't say that there was some specific reason you wanted someone else to do it.\n\nA pretty crappy message to send the guy, I'll say...", "Are you an asshole?  You knew he would like to walk you down the aisle but you chose not to do it and now he is hurt.\n\nMaybe you're not an asshole, maybe you are.\n\nIf you are worried, put some effort into the relationship and make sure he knows how much you love him!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Many brides, even one's who love their dads (or parents) very much, choose to forego the tradition in favour of simplicity, or avoiding the whole \"let's stare intently at the bride while she's doing this walk that feels like an eternity\" business. I had both my parents walk in with me because I didn't want to do the walk alone while everyone stared, lol, but everyone should make that decision for themselves. My brother and his husband just waited at the front while we all filed in at their wedding. My cousin and her husband walked (mostly skipped, lol) in together.
