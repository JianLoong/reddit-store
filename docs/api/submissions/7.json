But for reasons at the time (mainly our children), we decided to continue the marriage until our children left home. \n\nBasically nothing has changed on a daily basis, we were* still the same couple as always, but we didn't force something we didn't want. \n\nWhen Michael moved away for college and home permanently (at age 19) we decided to make the gradual move and finally make our divorce official. \n\nMichael didn't handle it well. For months he tried to convince us to try couples therapy, \"intervention\", that it was a bad phase in the marriage and not to sign the divorce paper until we were sure. \n\n\nWe explained together, separately that it wasn't a bad phase and that we stayed together for the good of the family only, etc. Over time, he conformed (but hasn't  accepted until today). \n\nI am currently married and so is Natalia. We have a great relationship and often spend Christmas and New Year's together with our children. \n\nWhat happened: \n\nMichael is engaged to Liam and we recently had dinner with him, his in-laws, fiance and Natalie to celebrate the engagement.\n\n Michael still has a habit of making spiteful comments about the divorce and how traumatizing his parents' experience of getting divorced was. Several times, I said that this was something that hurt us to hear, because above all, my ex and I cherish that our children don't suffer from our decision. \n\nDuring dinner, we were talking to his in-laws and they asked how long we'd been apart and how good we had a relationship etc. \n\nMichael at some point, said: \"It wasn't such a good thing for the family, it was a traumatizing experience to see your inspiration as a couple break up and your family fall apart\".\n\n To say that Natalie and I were embarrassed that he said it in front of his in-laws is not necessary. \n\nI had my limit and I said \"Look, Mike, I understand your feelings, but it's been 9 years that your mother and I haven't been together and you didn't even live with us during this process. We are already in another moment of our lives. I think it's over time to get over it and turn the page\". \n\nHe was quiet and stayed that way for most of dinner, saying only what was necessary. \n\nLater, I got a text from him criticizing me saying I should respect his feelings and he was just venting which was a valid thing and I shouldn't say that  in front of his in-laws. \n\nAITA?\n\nEnglish is not my first language and I'm not an expert at it (google translate helped). When I said that our children didn't suffer, I mean we tried everything that wasn't the worst scenario and that they didn't suffer so much, obviously there would be \"damage\", but that it was as little as possible. Although many say it was a lie (and that's ok), it was the best scenario for several reasons as well besides the children at the time.", "created_utc": 1673709065, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bqp92/aita_for_telling_my_son_to_get_over_the_divorce/", "score": 5334, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a right to your own happiness and you've made every effort to make the situation work.", "If your son wants to vent, he needs to go to a therapist. What your son was doing was criticizing you in front of his future in\u2013laws. That's not right, and you were very gracious in the manner in which you corrected him. NTA.", "NTA. It wasn't appropriate dinner conversation, but he brought it up first. 9 years is a really long time to not be able to adjust to a change made when he was an adult. Have you ever explained to Michael that you and your ex were only staying together for the kids for most of his life? He can't just attack you about a decade old divorce every time you interact with him, that's ridiculous.", "NTA. It's been 9 years - more than enough time to recover from it. He needs to see a therapist and work out his feelings if he's truly still upset by it.", "So your son is a hypocrite and doesn't even care... \n\nYou have to respect HIS feelings, but he doesn't have to respect yours. \n\nYOU shouldn't say anything in front of his in laws but HE can.\n\nYour son has some growing up to do.\n\nNTA", "NTA Michael was an adult and living elsewhere when you divorced and he\u2019s an adult now.

He\u2019s an adult. He can get therapy.", "Michael has the right to be upset about the divorce, but it doesn't look like he's trying to work through it.

NTA", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s an adult and can vent in the presence of a professional.", "NTA.  You can't revolve the rest of your life and your relationships around him. He is a grown man and him criticizing you is not helping you or him.   Sounds like he needs therapy to grieve and process the divorce and come to terms with it.", "NAH. I fully believe you and your wife have viewed this divorce as amicable and are content with how it went but I think you maybe need to acknowledge that events can be perceived very differently by others. \n\nHave you asked him about that? Not in a way where you'd immediately come back to counter any of his feelings on it. What about Lily, how has she reacted and how do Lily and Michael talk about this?", "NTA. Not for the specifics of the situation, but your son seems intent on openly judging you and your ex for doing what was best for each other. He doesn\u2019t even complain about the time you spent together, so it\u2019s not like he grew up miserable.\n\nSince the divorce was amicable and you are still friends, you are correct that your son needs to get over it. He\u2019s allowed to have his feelings, those feelings don\u2019t justify him taking out his frustrations on you.", "NTA.  He's a hypocrite for pretending that he wasn't being rude and disrespectful and then acting the victim when rebuffed.  He was an adult and out of the house when you divorced.  Both you and your ex have moved on and are in new relationships.  It's time that he grows up and accepts that.", "NTA Michael needs to understand the sacrifice you and your ex made for his stability.

NTA", "NAH\n\nSee this is a hard one, as for all intents and purposes you lied for half his life until the divorce. You played the happy couple and then suddenly dropped a divorce in his lap when he was hitting some milestones in his life that he wanted his parents, the loving couple, to experience.\n\nWhat you could have done was family therapy instead of marriage counseling, but that seems to not have happened.\n\nYou made choices that had a negative influence on him, so it's not abnormal for him to express that.", "NTA.\nYou stayed together and stayed happy even if you weren't in love until it no longer affected his day to day life.

You guys are able to make your own decisions, you waited until it didn't impact their day to day lives, and it was amicable. A lot of time has elapsed. Perhaps he has an issue related to something else in his life/childhood and he's making it about the divorce as a coping mechanism. I can see being upset your parents are not together but when there is no fighting, bitterness and terrible comments toward the ex that the kids can see,  I can't see it being traumatizing. He's saying staying together and slowly dissolving impacted his youth but he also tried to convince you to stay together at the time. So which of those two conflicting things is he upset with? You need to live your lives and it sounds like your divorce was better for the kids than 99.9% of all divorces in history.", "Nobody wins here. The parents kept an amicable relationship to keep a family unit together, which is essentially a lie. They waited until the children had left the home before divorcing, and their younger son has taken it badly.\n\nSo the parents need to acknowledge that the son can feel betrayed, or a myriad of other feelings And they should acknowledge it instead of glossing over with we did what was best for you.\n\nBut the son needs to realize that his parents acted out of what they believed was the best intent for him and his sister. Would it have been better had they gotten divorced when he was still in school?  Then it would\u2019ve been shuttling back-and-forth from home to home, split custody, birthdays, holidays, etc. Or does he just want them to stay together forever in the big lie so that he can be happy?\n\nBut either way, this boy needs some therapy or counseling or way to work through this because it\u2019s gonna call her every relationship he has. He will always be waiting for betrayal and the anger he feels towards his parents is going to manifest itself in some unhealthy way.", "NTA.

Because you pretended to be a couple since your children were 10yo (even if you were just friends), your children never imagined you'd get a divorce. They looked at you as the ideal and perfect marriage. \n\nThe divorce came as a huge shock, and unfortunately your son isn't over it yet. He could use a therapist to help him. \n\nIt's usually easier when the children see the obvious, that the parents don't understand eachother. Occasion fighting, obviously not a perfect marriage. The divorce doesn't come as a shock then.", "NTA. He isn\u2019t a child. If he\u2019s still having trouble processing he should see a therapist. By your account your kids were not traumatised at all with the divorce and you and your ex-wife have had a great friendship post divorce that impacts him positively. His inability to get over it is not your problem.", "Nta. He was old enough to understand it wasn\u2019t go work & still tried to force y\u2019all then. 9 years later he\u2019s still doing it.", "NTA. Your son is allowed to feel however he feels, but there\u2019s a time and place to bring it up. Like therapy. \n\nImo he needs to make strides to move on. Lots of parents get divorced. Mine did when I was 14 and I would never hold that against them \u2014 it was the best thing for them", " ESH. You both have the right to your feelings. Mike clearly was traumatized by the divorce. However, the passive aggressive comments are unnecessary and his timing was inappropriate. He needs therapy to work through this.\n\nIt's great that you and your ex have moved on so easily,  but being dismissive of your son's feelings really sucks, no matter how bad his timing happened to be. You need to apologize immediately and see what you can do to help rectify the situation. Offer to pay for a few therapy sessions, maybe?", "Nta", "NTA. Respect works both ways and he has no respect for the decision that you and Natalie made", "My parents divorced when I was 10, I\u2019m 27 now. I\u2019ve always maintained that I\u2019m glad my parents got divorced when they did and didn\u2019t stay together \u201cfor the kids\u201d \u2014but my parents did NOT have an amicable divorce. They fought a lot leading up to their breakup, and if they would have stayed together I can guarantee that would\u2019ve had a negative impact on me. They\u2019re much better apart than together.\n\nIn your case, you and your ex-wife stayed together because things were amicable between you. Your kids likely grew up thinking their parents had a good relationship, and were blindsided by the divorce. You also say you told your kids that you only stayed together for \u201cthe good of the family.\u201d So that good marriage your kids likely thought you had was actually not a good marriage, but rather a choice to stay together to raise your family.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you made the wrong choice to stay together \u2014because there\u2019s not really a wrong or right choice in the scenario you described. But your son is entitled to feel traumatized and lied to, because he WAS lied to. A lie by omission, sure, but his entire concept of his parents\u2019 marriage was shattered.\n\nI\u2019m going with NAH \u2014but you need to understand that your son is entitled to feel how he feels. However, he should probably also consider therapy if he\u2019s not already in it, because nine years is a long time to still have so many negative associations to an amicable divorce that happened when he was an adult.", "INFO While I believe his feelings are valid, did you ask why he felt he could say things in front of his in-laws, but you couldn\u2019t?", "NTA.\nYou stayed together and stayed happy even if you weren't in love until it no longer affected his day to day life.

Instead you took a stand in front of his in laws.", "NTA \n\nHe's allowed to have his feelings but he's being very selfish about it. Also more than a little naive.

Divorce is going to be a difficult pill to swallow for everyone involved but your son has so many advantages-he\u2019s grown, both of his parents get along still, you and your ex-wife worked very hard to make it as easy for your children as you possibly could. It would be one thing for you to have told him to get over it as soon as the papers were signed (you would have been TA for that) but he made a big deal about it at a group gathering years after the divorce. \n\nHe really does need to get over it enough to not make it uncomfortable for everyone at group functions.", "NTA If he wants to \u201cvent\u201d at a nice dinner, in front of his in laws, he has to understand that he had opened a topic and others may have something to express as well.

NTA. \n\nMichael seems to be stuck in an \u201cinjured child\u201d script. He\u2019s 30 years old, he\u2019s about to be married himself. His inability to come to terms with the reality that his parents chose to separate is an issue for him to address with a therapist or a supportive loved one on his own, not by sniping at his parents at a celebratory dinner. He was out of line, and I don\u2019t blame his father for taking him up short.", "ESH\n\nMichael because if this is still bothering him 9 years later he should seek therapy rather than make passive -aggressive comments. However, he is right in his feelings that your choices destroyed his example of a healthy relationship because:\n\nYou and your Ex: You lied to your children for over a decade. Rather than dealing with the consequences of ending the marriage you pretended that everything was okay. You quite literally gave Michael a false sense of security and then the instant he was out of the house ripped that security away and you refuse to take responsibility for that", "NTA, he is playing victim,  9 yrs later.", "NTA. There\u2019s a time and place for his venting about your divorce, and the dinner wasn\u2019t the time or place.

If you two were his \u201cinspiration as a couple\u201d, he should be further inspired by the fact that you two were able to have such an amicable divorce and still are able to have a family together, even if apart. My parents never got married, but they also didn\u2019t hate each other and my mom even went to my dad\u2019s wedding; being able to be cordial with the person you share children with is sadly such a rare thing and your kids should be grateful you didn\u2019t leave off on worse terms. Being able to communicate your feelings with each other openly and come to that agreement is such a big deal that I think shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.", "Your son feels lied to and betrayed.

He is an adult and should understand that his parents are also adults who are perfectly capable of living their own lives and can't be expected to stay together just because he has a notion of relationship that doesn't fit the real world.\nYou talked to him in, apparently, a calm and polite manner, and that's all that is required. Besides, he can't get hurt to be reprimanded when he keeps on judging his parents attitude with other people", "Nta. \n\nVenting is a valid thing but this was not the time or place to be doing so. Also has he been carrying on like this for 9 years? It may be that he has confided in his fianc\u00e9 his version of events, in-laws also know his version of events, and he was playing his role in his version of the events at this dinner party. I don\u2019t think there is any \u2018good\u2019 way to get divorced, I think you make the best of the situation, which is kinda sounds like you guys as parents did. \n\nDoes he feel it wasn\u2019t addressed enough back in the day and has never gotten over it?? Not sure what he identifies as his exact trauma is. That is now for him to deal with as an adult, 9 years later, and you can offer to help in any way possible.

Obviously, Michael did suffer, he found the divorce very hard to accept, & I suspect that rather than helping him, you just shut him down. Imagine admiring your parents & their marriage for your whole life, & then they tell you it was a sham & the last 10 years of it were a complete lie. The people you think you can trust most in the world have lied to you every day for half your life. If you don\u2019t think that\u2019s disillusioning and hurtful, then I can\u2019t imagine what you would think was a disillusionment. And your advice now - and probably then - is get over it.

My friend who's my age (same as your daughter's age) had his parents divorce when he was 20ish and it hit him incredibly hard at the time and he to this day remains a little bitter about it and while always polite in person will make jabs about his parents and step parents to me. It really hits people differently and I think the older they are the harder it ends up being to make peace with the idea because it's so built in.

It may have caused more that divorcing when you realized you weren\u2019t a good fit. Based on Michaels reaction at 19, sounds like he was pretty blindsided and may have felt lied to for the time you two stayed together. While I agree he should get over it for his own sake, he doesn\u2019t owe you that just to make you feel better about your choice\u2019s impact on him.", "Coming from someone with divorced parents, yes it\u2019s traumatizing. But it happened while I was in middle school. Everyone\u2019s parents gossiping about while being forced to bring and extra bag to school and never feeling like I had a permanent home was the traumatizing part. My parents admitting they didn\u2019t love each other and ending their toxic relationship was a good thing I understood AT ELEVEN. He does need to get over it. He could\u2019ve had it so much harder, especially since he gets to have both you and your ex.

Many said the divorce resulted in some sort of difficulty with their own intimate relationships.\n\n Sure, they may not have to go through some of the other traumatizing stuff like custody battles and the like, but the way you and your ex-wife went about this was incredibly hurtful contributed to the negative emotions.\n\n>In cases where parents are civil and there is not any overt fighting, it's a pretty tranquil home environment. And often the kids don't really understand how alienated the parents are from one another. So, if the divorce occurs when the child is in college, and he or she did not see it coming, it has the potential to severely destabilize the student's life.\n\nYou LIED to them.

He needs a professional to listen to you and your ex and help him process.", "No, it's the divorce. He went away to college and found out his ENTIRE LIFE was a lie. They completely destroyed his sense of self doing it the way they did.\n\nThere is a lot of evidence that adult children of parents who get divorced are just as traumatized, especially as here, where they don't see it coming. Parents underestimate how their divorce will affect their adult children. \n\nOP is blind if he thinks they didn't traumatize the kids", "It would be NAH if son didn't act like an AH about that \"point of view\". He essentially is guilting them about eventually going through the divorce instead of forever living a lie for their adult son. He's not saying that he's angry about the lie of the perfect relationship, about it being a huge shock etc. No. He's mad that his perfect family no longer exists. By keeping his parents together, he wants to preserve his childhood. He doesn't care about them as people deserving of true love, but as actors playing on the role of relationship model.", "It is also unsurprising that Michael is expressing his feelings about his parents' divorce as he is getting married himself. Sounds like this is likely more about Michael's fear that his own marriage may fail.\n\nOP doesn't say whether Michael has consistently been this upset about the divorce throughout the past 9 years, or if this recent outburst was unusual.", "Yes, and he\u2019s got a kind of idealized view of his parents. This was not a perfect marriage. This is two people who enjoyed each other\u2018s company and stayed together because they loved their children and wanted to raise them together.\n\nI think Michael needs to understand that this was in no way a perfect marriage. This was a really good friendship but not a marriage. With nothing at stake, his parents had nothing to be hurt about. They were business partners.\n\nBefore he puts unrealistic expectations on his marriage, he absolutely needs to adjust his expectations of how people behave in a marriage.", "I mean though, they weren't \"pretending\" to be a couple? They were just a couple that had fallen out of love. It's not like they got married with the intention of tricking their kids. I don't think it would have been better to pretend to absolutely hate each other, fight, and then divorce in dramatic fashion, just so the kids wouldn't feel so surprised.\n\nIdk if they ever had any type of heart to heart with him about why their marriage failed, but maybe it would help him to see the situation fully as an adult.", "I agree with this. I had the experience of looking up to my parents and having that view crushed. It still affects my life in tangible ways. I wonder if your son feels like the pain your divorce caused him has never been acknowledged. He should have done this in private for sure, but it might be worth having an in-person, one on one conversation where you ask him to share the pain he felt from the divorce, without telling him he shouldn't feel that way or should be over it. One good session of active listening might make all the difference.", "He was an adult when it happened and the divorce wasn't an angry or traumatic one. He is pushing 30 now. For christ's sake. If their parents had divorced when he was younger or if they were the type of people that fougth all the time, throwing their children into the mess, then I could understand his anger. \"My picture perfect inspiration of a wedding ended.\"That seems to be his reasons, it is a valid feeling. The way he has be coping with this is completely unreasonable though. What he wanted? That they kept themselves in a loveless marriage just to not break a grown adult illusion? Is he going to keep bringing this up forever? In the most inappropriate contexts?", "OP keeps trying to say \"we feel good that we didn't traumatize the kids.\" when it's OBVIOUS, Michael is still traumatized.

He turns 18 and goes to college looking for something close to this perfect example... and finds out his ENTIRE LIFE is a lie, and his parents? They are liars who deceived him for years. They let him think his life was perfect and normal with no problems and completely shattered the foundation of who he thought he was.\n\nThere is a lot of data that says adult children are just as traumatized by divorce as they are as kids. Sure, they may not have to go through some of the other traumatizing stuff like custody battles and the like, but the way OP and his wife went about this was incredibly hurtful.  They then did **nothing** to help him through it because they did what you're doing and what every parent with adult children do: totally underestimating how it will affect their kids.  \n\nEven now, after a decade of him being angry and upset about it, OP still doesn't recognize that he was traumatized by this. He prefers to stay in his bubble of \"we didn't traumatize our kids like everyone else.\" When this post, in and of itself, is evidence, that is not true.", "Their son sure didn\u2019t. His in laws made an innocuous comment about it being nice that a divorced couple has an amicable relationship and he decided that this was the perfect time to unload deep seated family resentment?

That's a better marriage than most people pull off", "But it wasn't a complete lie. It sounds like the parents weren't faking a great romance but living together amicably as part of a family. That was absolutely real. It might be that Michael needs to sit with the idea that everything isn't about him. It's kind of weird to be 30, planning your own marriage, and having intense opinions about how other people should feel about each other. The opinion that you have to be \"in love\" with your partner for a marriage to be real is a very immature one. Over investment in a parent's love life is not a great thing. It's a weird kind of enmeshment Michael is trying to make happen while mom and dad are fully capable of functioning as individuals.", "My thoughts exactly! ESH op is lying to himself if he thinks this divorce didn't affect his kids just because they're grown", "I'd like to know if OP offered to cover therapy for the kids when they separated.  I mean right off the bat that \"starting together for the kids\" line is old and hackneyed. If they'd just split up when the kids were still kids they'd still have the stability of childhood elsewhere - familiar friends, familiar school, familiar surroundings - and the parents, of they were responsible, would have made sure the kids could come to them to talk, or talk to a therapist. \n\nBut as the story is told, it sounds like they coasted until Michael was already going through his first major life changes into adulthood when he would already be feeling off balance, and his parents pulled the rug out from under the family he thought was one of the things he could count on to stay stable and strong while he was finding his balance everywhere else, and then just... left him in a new, unfamiliar and stressful environment surrounded by strangers to figure out how to cope.", "Yeah, ESH. Many people struggle with feeling like their entire childhood was a lie when their parents stay together \"for the kids.\" It's pretty normal for it to be traumatic- even as an adult and OP is incredibly dismissive of it", "Kid.  Michael is the only one with an issue, nothing is said about his daughter Lily.\n\nFrankly I'm impressed they stayed together until both kids were out of the house, it shows maturity AND (despite what Michael thinks) consideration for the impact on the children.\n\nThis was not a bad divorce with cheating, abuse or other bullshit.  It was just two people who fell out of love and proceeded to not only take account of their kids but themselves.  A no-fault divorce.  If all divorces happened like this it wouldn't be so bad.", "I agree, ESH. They thought that since the youngest was out of the house that it wouldn\u2019t be as traumatizing for the kid. They were obviously wrong. Maybe the kid missed the signs of the trouble in the marriage or maybe he just dismissed the signs. Sounds like some family therapy would be beneficial for everyone.", "Agree with your take. ESH but more so OP.", "Because he found out his entire life was a lie and who he thought he was didn't actually exist, and his parents were liars who spent years deceiving him? \n\nThey got him to adulthood and completely shattered who he thought he was and what he thought his life was.", "NTA... while his feelings are valid, he didn't get to spray them on everyone. He needs to get some therapy.", "I don\u2019t think OP is an AH, but I agree with your reasoning.

He\u2019s remarried, she\u2019s great, we all get along. We\u2019re much happier and from my perspective, they have two happy homes.

I can tell you, as a child therapist, kids are often impacted by parental divorce at younger ages, so breaking up sooner isn't a solution to this either. Even kids whose parents divorced before the kids could remember are impacted. Divorce is hard. Michael can have whatever feelings he wants about it.

It's totally valid for it to be hard to have your parents get divorced, and yeah, Michael wasn't living w them anymore, but it's gotta be weird to leave home and then immediately hear from your parents that their marriage, which you thought was fine, is over. That certainly doesn't mean that the parents have to stay together or don't have the right to make their own choices, but it's unrealistic for the parents to insist that their kids have no feelings about the situation. \n\n I'm going with ESH bc OP refuses to acknowledge that the divorce might have been hard for his son, which is certainly feeding (but not an excuse for) the son's AH behavior. I don't think it's fair to tell son to just \"get over it\" when his parent refuses to acknowledge his feelings as real but also son is an adult and should figure out other ways to process that don't involve snapping in front of the in laws.

It does not show maturity. It shows that they did not consider the long term consequences of the facade they put up - as evidenced by Michael's resentment.

He's upset that they spent years lying to him every waking moment of the day by presenting themselves as a loving couple. It was basically a lie of omission for years. He used what they showed him to pattern and model his own understanding of how marriage works, and then he found out that it had become a lie at some point and he doesn't know how or when. \n\nI can blame him for throwing a public temper tantrums nine years later.

Why can't the parents have a transition period to lessen the blow? Parents can, you know, TALK to their kids. Explain what's going on and live together for another year or so, slowly transitioning out. Separate bedrooms, not doing as many activities with both of them there, etc.", "Of course he can. That means his father can just continue to invalidate his feelings? His father said that he and his ex cherish that they didn't hurt their kids. They did hurt Michael! He has told them so! The parents are so engrossed in their narrative that they did it the right way that they don't care if their child has feelings about it.", "I would argue that the relationship between parents is certainly a child\u2019s business, as it directly affects them. Good or bad or in between, parents impact their children\u2019s lives and their views of the world. \n\nBut beyond that, he\u2019s clearly struggling with issues relating directly to his parents. Having them in therapy with him, if they were willing, would allow all parties the space to have an open and honest dialogue with a trained professional to help guide them.", "He could of course. That isn't to say that a family therapy might not also help, right?", "He should go to therapy for that. And shouldn't have said that with other people. \n\nBut OP seems like he is in denial about his son's feeling and how it affected him. And from the tone of the whole thing it appears that Michael has tried to talk about it (even through \"contant remarks\") and has for a while but OP \"prides himself that the divorce didn't hurt or traumatize his children\".\n\nWhen a son is hurt and the parents seem to disregard and dismiss (even ignore and pretend they don't see) the son's feelings it can obviously lead to resentment and for him to make remarks on the situation. Also, he said it was a traumatic situation for him, and OP seems to be extremely pissed off about this because they pride themselves that it wasn't. It isn't their place to tell what was traumatizing and what wasn't. And OP only seem to have responded because he felt that what he said wasn't correct.", "But they weren\u2019t lying. Geesh. They were keeping a two parent stable  home for their kids.", "They were reasonably happy, just not sexually satisfied. They did not fight, they did not call names or make each other the bad guy, they lived like many couples lived before divorce was an acceptable option.\n\nAnd it is absolutely fair to blame their adult son for where he decides to complain about it. And the other kid obviously doesn't feel the same.", "He accepts his son's right to have feelings... he responded this way after 9 years of his son passive aggressively making remarks. If he is continually getting hurt,  it is self inflicted. Frequency of the remarks is irrelevant. After 9 years, it's on his son to get therapy and resolve this. He's an adult.  The parents did nothing wrong. They divorced... on good terms. The son's feelings are valid,  but it is up to him to come to terms with his own feelings and to stop punishing everyone else.", "So, you agree, he needs therapy... i.e. needs to work through it... i.e. need to get over it. I'm glad we agree.", "I would say they're about the same level of jerk, but it might be more difficult for one of them not to be a jerk.\n\nReading between the lines and assuming some things though, if Mike is on one of those perpetual victim dealios where he needs help, won't get it, and takes every opportunity to make family gatherings awkward and broadcast his victimhood, and this is the first time OP has really pushed back at all (albeit poorly), then Mike is definitely the bigger AH. But it's tough to tell that for sure. My family had one of those, so it's something that I know to look for.", "Exactly this. My mom loved to throw in our face she stayed unhappy for us and we were ungrateful. \n\nGod almighty it was awful and my brother and I wished daily for them to split.", "I'm sort of surprised you took this stance given your background. I came from a similar background too, and am around the same age. I   \n dealt with all the fights, etc. I also wished my parents would divorce and mine are also still together. Due to all this, I actually empathize with Michael a lot more because I can understand the thought process.\n\nYes his parents are an example to strive for, in terms of maintaining good relations, even after falling out of love. But, at that point, if they are already out of love, I agree with some of the others that they do more harm than good. Because, if they can successfully co-parent, without feeling as if they are still in a relationship, then what should stop them from doing so while actually divorced, even before the kids are grown?\n\nBecause, unfortunately, the result of that is that either the child forms thoughts, or is typically told to or implied to by a parent that, \"if you \\[they\\] didn't exist, I'd be out of here by now...I'd be happy\". And that is a huge, guilt-laden burden on anyone, let alone a child. That's why I am very interested to know how the sister reacted because if they even implied something like this...that they were only still together for the kids...then I bet Michael isn't the only one that thinks that way. He just might be the most agressive at stating his opinion on the matter.", "Right! And it's not like his folks lied. There were happy being a family, just not in love any more", "It wasn't a lie though. His parents were happy, just not in love anymore. They didn't want to break up the family. So while I get that Michael is upset, the alternative would have been a divorce while young, custody agreements, shuttling back and forth... definitely a worse proposition. \n\nI don't want to minimize Michael's initial shock, however I would hope after nine years some part of him can appreciate the love his parents had for each other and him, even if they weren't in love anymore.", "My parents divorced when I was young, and it was never an issue. My friends whose parents divorced in their teens and older struggled a ton more. The ones that had parents divorce while they were in college/graduated college who stayed together for the kids struggled the most.", "I kind of got that impression about him as well. There's no such thing as a perfect marriage. If they were just going through the motions for as long as OP says, Michael should have been able to tell his parents weren't in love. I can tell at a glance when my parents are unhappy and trying to cover it up. My assumption is there were plenty of signs, and he just didn't care enough to see them because it wasn't affecting him. If he feels a family dinner to celebrate his engagement with his parents, their partners, and his future in-laws is a good place to bring up his trauma over their amicable divorce than his fiance is in for some fun times in the future.", "OP is definitely nta for the specific situation, but I think it's unreasonable to just tell the kid to get over it or his emotions are invalid. The son suddenly found out a large part of his life was a lie. Entirely reasonable to not be happy about that, I can imagine some trust issues may arose as a consequence. Hard to say without the sons perspective but it does not sound like the parents really ever tried to do anything to help him with this and just assumed he'd get over it.", "It also might not have been as financially sound for them to get divorced earlier. It means 2 households, 1 income each, and splitting the kids between them. That\u2019s more expensive than 1 household, plus it\u2019s more time. Someone having to drive the kids back and forth for starters. This gave the kids a chance to maybe even have more in life.", "This is exposing myself as a pop culture junkie but it\u2019s a well known thing Khloe Kardashian has big periods of memory loss from her childhood after her father died. There\u2019s stuff her siblings talk about and she doesn\u2019t remember it happening just large portions of childhood stories blanked. \n\nI was thinking about it the other day a lot of the things that seem inconsistent or patchy in Prince Harry\u2019s memory of his childhood could be attributed to loss/trauma too. I haven\u2019t seen anyone talking about how many people black out negative memories or suffer really patchy memories if they\u2019ve had significant trauma.", "It\u2019s crazy but my memories ever since leaving my parents home have been way more vibrant.", "I have a hard time thinking the son is the AH that everyone is making him out to be still. If I went my entire life looking up to my parents as the ideal couple, and then the second I moved out for college they reveal it was all a lie and they are getting a divorce\u2026 I would be deeply traumatized. I don\u2019t think the parents are AHs either because they did what they thought was best, but I don\u2019t think it was the right call.", "You have deviated so far from the initial post I\u2019m starting to wonder if you are even in the same zip code of what OP asked. Try again.", "Not to mention that going away for college is already a pretty destabilising time in your life anyway", "What improves, in your mind, if they had gotten a divorce instead of happily co-parenting as good friends?\n\nI mean, do you even go on this subreddit? Lol. There are CONSTANTLY stories about people who have horror shows for step-parents and all these fucking crazy stories about being pushed out of their parents life in favor of half- or step-children. Can you *honestly* say that OP and his ex\u2019s way of parenting is really that bad? Even after divorce, they\u2019re still friends who can spend quality time together. Their childhood couldn\u2019t possibly have been that terrible.", "For me it would depend on how their marriage actually played out for the kids to consider this a lie. I get that it will feel like the marriage has been a lie for Michael once he got confronted with the truth, but at some point he probably should have accepted that not every marriage is a fairy tale marriage and that life doesn't always follow the same structures that we always see when we grow up.\n\nIf they kept being very affectionate and it felt like a romantic relationship to the kids, I'd understand why Michael got so hung up about it, but if they were merely friends living together who also raised kids together, I find it weird that he refuses to accept that.", "Why though? They were happy to stay married and raise their children together in a single household. They were willing to put their romantic needs on hold and put their children first.\n\nDivorcing would mean co-parenting, which means two homes, two mortgages, working more to pay for those mortgages, juggling all their schedules, separate holidays, missing out on important moments, etc. Even at the best of times, co-parenting is a financial and logistical struggle. \n\nOP\u2019s children were raised in a loving and happy home. His son should be grateful that he was \u201cblindsided\u201d. That means he wasn\u2019t raised by people who hated each other and were constantly fighting. I\u2019m sure there are many people here who would prefer the son\u2019s upbringing to their own.", "It's not though. He isn't in the relationship, he's a child of it. Your parents have an entire relationship you aren't, haven't been, and never will be privvy to. That's the same for everyone. \n\nHis parents don't have to sit him down an recount what went wrong. He just has to accept that it did and move on.\n\nHe's the only one who needs therapy. His parents don't need an open dialogue because they told him the were splitting up a decade ago, did that and moved on.\n\nAt a certain point, like past 25, it's not on your parents anymore. If he needs therapy to sort this out, he needs to go. He doesn't need mommy and daddy there. He needs to put on his big boy pants and realise his parents and the world don't revolve around him and how he feels", "How would it help anyone?\n\nIt's none of his business. There isn't any reason he'll accept in therapy for the split that he won't already accept because he's literally almost 30 and should know how relationships go by now.", "Having a secret \u2018countdown to divorce/kids move out\u2019 is not being honest.", "Since we are already assuming here, since Op thinks Mike isn\u2019t allowed to have feelings about this situation he would probably not be receptive of Mike going to therapy about it. so maybe Mike doesn\u2019t tell Op about therapy. Or maybe Op knows and thinks its not important to mention since Mike\u2018s feelings aren\u2019t valid to begin with.\n\nWe have no way of knowing wether or not Mike is in therapy and if he has other things to deal with instead of just his parents divorce", "To respond to your first and second paragraph, I was going to say \u201cwell if Michael reacted this badly when he was *nineteen,* which is a legal adult, how badly do you think he would have reacted as a *child*?  It sounds like there\u2019s just no winning with him. \n\nBut your third paragraph gives me pause because it\u2019s a perspective that hadn\u2019t occurred to me.  Michael could have very well interpreted this whole thing as \u201cif this divorce was a good thing, that must mean I was an obstacle in the way of my parent\u2019s happiness,\u201d and so is doubling down on the stance that the divorce was a bad decision as a defense mechanism.  So thank you for that. \n\nSo, I feel a little more sympathy for him now, but he\u2019s still an adult.  Legally speaking, he was an adult when the divorce happened.  He\u2019s allowed to have his feelings, but that doesn\u2019t mean he has the right to take it out on his parents, who are acting like the adults they are and using civil communication", "I don't know about those cases, but they are also good examples !", "Yeah, I have a phase of my life where I felt like I just started to be fully conscious, around 13-14, after my parents divorce (and other events). I would suggest therapy, it can help understand a lot of things !", "It\u2019s the \u201call a lie\u201d part that bugs me -\n\n >Basically nothing has changed on a daily basis, we were* still the same couple as always, but we didn't force something we didn't want.\n\nSo clearly there was no romance or pretense of romance for 9 years. What \u201clie\u201d does Michael resent then? That his parents loved, respected, valued each other? They did, seems like still do so that wasn\u2019t a lie. \n\nHe\u2019s mad that his parents didn\u2019t experience romantic feelings for each other that they didn\u2019t pretend to have?  Okay he can be mad about that but it\u2019s still not a lie.", "Well, first of all, feelings are feelings, there's not debating if they're legitimate or not. They're here, and they have to be adressed, by therapy either alone or not. And I think at 28 years old, you should know that. But that's still hard on him.\nAnd if it was the right call or not... maybe not the best, but since we cannot know how the son would have reacted otherwise, we cannot know. What if they realized they were better off as friends when the son was 19 ? It would have been the same for him. It was done this way and it cannot be changed.", "Umm, the guy literally says they played at being a happy couple and nothing changed from the outside. It was exactly a lie", "First of all, there is no \u2018cut off\u2019 age for when your parents no longer have to take responsibility for the things they did while raising you. The impact remains. \n\nSecond, who else would you go to family therapy with but family?  The whole point is for families to work out their issues together under the guidance of a therapist. Parents don\u2019t stop being family because of your age. \n\nTherapy wouldn\u2019t be to recount what went wrong or why the marriage dissolved. Of course couples divorce and don\u2019t have to recount every issue to their children. The divorce isn\u2019t the issue. It is the near decade of lying that is the issue. That lie directly impacted OP\u2019s son\u2019s life and shifted his perspective on relationships, not just his parents\u2019 relationship. \n\nHe\u2019s not asking for the world to revolve around him, he is trying to reconcile how his parents could lie to him for years. For OP, and other commenters, to act like he should just act his age is completely sidestepping the larger issue that OP\u2019s son is grappling with.", "How do you know there is no reason he'll accept? What I understand is, Michael idealized his parents marriage, found out it was a sham for most of the childhood he remembers, and was told he shouldn't feel that way. Should Michael seek help for this? YES. Should his dad keep pretending that none of the family was hurt by the divorce? NO, because obviously some of them were!", "He found out a fucking decade ago dude. \n\nThat's so much time for him to reach out, have a discussion, ask questions, connect. \n\nHe didn't. He insulted his parents at a dinner they went to to support him.", "Because the reason he was already given was \"we aren't in love, we don't want to be together\" and he isn't accepting it.\n\nHe found that out 9 years ago when he was 19 and old enough to understand that \"we don't want to be together anymore\" is a valid reason to break up.\n\nSorry, but after a decade and being 28, it's not good enough. He's making scenes at family dinners for fucks sake. \n\nHe didn't find out yesterday, he found out a decade ago, saw his parents move on, get remarried and be happy and he is still acting like a 5 year old", "I\u2019m not saying his words at the dinner are excusable. Verdictwise, I think this post is an ESH. \n\nBut OP\u2019s language in the post focuses on deflecting his son\u2019s genuine, emotional reaction to the divorce and the reveal that his parents were playing house for half of his life. \n\nIt does not sound like OP ever validated his son\u2019s feelings once the divorce was announced, and they\u2019ve been left to stew and simmer in the intervening decade."]}
