{"id": 7, "submission_id": "yihz2z", "title": "AITA for refusing to give my son pants?", "selftext": "Today kids can wear their costumes to school. My son's costume includes a leotard. I got a call around ten asking me to bring in pants for my son. I was really annoyed, because I was at work, but I went home and grabbed some. I got to the classroom, and there were SO MANY kids wearing leotards. Not the majority or anything, but a fair number of girls were wearing costumes that had leotards.\n\nI went up to the teacher and asked what the issue was. She said it wasn't appropriate. I pointed out all the girls with leotards, and she said that was fine. I said that if it's fine for them it's fine for him. If there's a rule (and no leotards wasn't on the guidelines) it needs to be enforced equally. She said I needed to change him or she was sending him to the office.\n\nI went to the office myself and got the principal. She was really annoyed but eventually agreed to go with me to the classroom. She looked at the costume and said \"it's fine.\" And then left. The teacher was clearly frustrated, and when I was leaving and thanked the principal she rolled her eyes at me.\n\nWhen I got back to work I told a friend the story and she said I was a little over the top. She said the teacher was probably worried something would happen, but that's stupid. If a rule exists, it needs to exist for everyone, not just boys.
