A year ago John contacted me again, asking if I wanted to meet for a coffee as friends.  As it turned out, he wanted get back together. I told him I still feel the same and that I have a boyfriend (one of my colleagues). He was disappointed but accepted it.\n\nJohn figured out where I work and started going to our place regularly as a customer. I couldn't do anything about it but after a year I would even say that we have established a somewhat friendly relationship.\n\nJohn showed great interest in the content of my work. He said that he would like to work in our company, but in a branch that is about 12 miles away so that we don't work together.

The boss said that he has an interview with him tomorrow and that if he likes him, he will recommend him elsewhere, but that he will definitely not work in our team.\n\nI asked John why he wanted to work at our branch even though I told him it would make me uncomfortable. He replied that he thought I wasn't serious about that and that he has finally gotten over our breakup and that he plans to move to a new apartment located 15 minutes from our branch (he wants to live super close to me and my boyfriend). He doesn't want to commute to the other branch and he thought that I'll be fine with his decision.\nWell I am not and now he thinks I am an asshole for making him commute further and potentially destroying his chances to get this job.\n\nNot only that but more people (including my boyfriend) are kinda on his side and think I shouldn't mind working with him if we both moved on. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695210140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16nj3qh/aita_for_not_wanting_to_work_with_my_exboyfriend/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why? Because I am selfish and don't want to see him every day and him potentially getting my coworkers and friends on his side. I am an asshole because he really wants to work at our place and there is a big chance it's not because of me but because he really likes the content of our work and maybe I took a big potential passion from him. He called me asshole because he will have to commute further to a different branch and they won't pay him for this time and gas.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n###[Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
