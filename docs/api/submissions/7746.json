The only reason I was able to accomplish this was by taking a gap year in 2021 and saving as much money as I could. I was able to do this due to my parents letting me live with them rent free and paying all the bills without asking for my financial contribution, the only things I paid for was fuel, car bills and very occasional I would get myself a coffee or go out for lunch but I usually wouldn\u2019t spend anymore than $10 a week outside of essentials and because of this and taking out a student loan I was able to not work while doing my first year, so I was able to focus on my studies. \n\nThe reason this is relevant is because I have over 25k in savings which is why my roommate asked to borrow money. \n\nMy roommate isn\u2019t at uni and works as a hairdresser and never saves any of the money she has which is ok but she pretty much spends her money as soon as her paycheque comes in and not on rent or bills and often struggles when it\u2019s time to pay rent. \n\nShe recently asked for a $800 loan to get new tires and break pads because her car didn\u2019t pass it\u2019s WOF (warrant of fitness) we live in nz you have to get a WOF once a year or you can get slapped with some pretty serious fines. \n\nNow usually I wouldn\u2019t actually mind lending a friend this kind of money because as long as they pay me back it\u2019s not causing any financial difficulties for me. Except I\u2019ve leant her money for rent before ($500) and it took six months of nagging her to get her to pay me back. And during this period of time she was going on shopping sprees, spending $200 a night to get on the piss and continuing to ask me for money to buy food when she wanted to go out which she would immediately pay me back but she still took 6 months to pay me back for rent. \n\nBecause of my last experience with lending her money I said no, that she would have to pay it herself or wait till she had the money but I would be happy to drop her off and pick her up from work since it\u2019s on the way to my work (I work full time during holidays) until she had the funds to get her car fixed. \n\nShe told me I was being a bitch and I don\u2019t understand how hard it is to work a full time job all year and have to pay bills. I pointed out that I saved money because I knew my parents couldn\u2019t afford to help me financially while I\u2019m studying whereas her parents send her $300 a week to help her out with expenses. \n\nShe didn\u2019t call me an asshole but asshole and bitch seem like synonyms of each other and she keeps shit talking me to her friends. \n\nOne of my other roommates doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole, but our other roommate thinks I am an asshole because I have so much in savings that it wouldn\u2019t make a difference to me even if I had to wait another six months to get the money back. (There\u2019s four of us in the house) \n\nSo AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: Just because a couple people mentioned/asked about it she knows about my savings because when we first started living together she asked if I had loaded parents because I could afford to pay rent, utilities, etc without working and I said I had some savings she then questioned how much I had saved and even though I said it didn\u2019t matter she bothered me about how much it was until I told her.", "created_utc": 1674140904, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10g40q6/aita_for_not_lending_my_roommate_money/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn't give her a single dime. \n\n\nNever lend money that you want to get back.", "NTA.\n\nNever loan money to family and friends that you can't afford to give as a gift.\n\nThe other important lesson here is, never tell anyone how much money you have saved up.\n\nSpeaking of family, if her parents send her $300 a ~~month~~ WEEK then they could probably front her the $800. And then send $200 a ~~month~~ WEEK for the next 8 ~~months~~ WEEKS.  See, they can enforce the \"payback\" because they can withhold funds.  Meanwhile you have no leverage except begging.", "NTA. The fact that her car didn\u2019t pass inspection isn\u2019t your responsibility, it\u2019s hers. Your savings is yours, for your own emergencies. Just because you have it does not mean you are obligated to be an ATM for the people in your life. And, considering the pain you had to go through to get paid back last time, you are completely justified.", "NTA\n\nAnd if anyone else thinks you should, then they can volunteer their own money to help her out!", "NTA. Loooove the entitlement that just because you\u2019re  co-lodging that entitles her to your savings. Given her track record in not timely paying you back, it would be painful to chase down the additional loan, while she likely asks for further funds during that time.", "None of her money issues are your responsibility.\n\nNTA", "Yea no Nta your not her bank she should think about saving like you", "NTA, she gets $300 a week sent to her by her parents on top of a full time wage. Tell her to eat dirt and pay her own stuff. She sounds like a spoiled brat who has no understanding of the value of money.", "NTA. You're not obligated to loan her money. You are not a bank. If her parents are sending her $300 a week, she only needs less than a month to get the money. You even offered to give her rides to work until she gets her car fixed. And who says it will only be six months before you get the money back? She may never pay it back.", "NTA You absolutely do understand what it's like to work and save. She is the one who doesn't understand what it means to be responsible with money. Loaning her that money would be too much of a risk. She had the money and pissed it away. Now she can work to earn more. She is not your responsibility.", "NTA\nYou even offered to help in other non-monetary ways. If the other roommates think you\u2019re the asshole they can lend her the money. Or she could get a credit card instead of a interest free loan from you and learn there are consequences to not paying shit back on a timely basis.", "NTA.  Here is another reason why we never share how much money we have saved with anyone. \n\nShe needs to cover these expenses herself.  Maybe she could ask her parents to advance her some of her weekly allowance.", "NTA\n\nShe's proven her bad track record of being difficult to get your money back from. She is also terrible with her money, which falls directly on her. \n\nJust because you have money in savings doesn't mean you're in any way obligated to lend her money, especially as substantial amount you may not even get back. Hold onto that savings for an emergency or something you'll need a lot of money for, say a down payment on a house when the time comes.", "NTA I didn't even read past the point where she's borrowed money in the past without paying you back. You are never obligated to loan a friend money.  In general, it's a bad idea. In this case, it's doubled.", "You're obviously NTA and my recommendation is that you never lend money to any of your roommates, this money is to help you not them (and what if you have a emergency and have spenda big part of your savings?). And for the one saying you're the A H tell her you will let your other roommate know her opinion and that since she's so offended for your lack of help she can give her money and wait the 6 months to get paid back. \n\nPS: You said that you lend $500 for rent, and assuming you pay the same, this means $800 will make the difference in your finances.", "NTA. You're not anyone's bank and it's honestly her responsibility to make sure her car is up to date and in good working order. I work minimum wage in retail and I still can keep my car in good working order so I don't see why she can't. This is why I have a strict rules of never lending friends money because they either won't pay me back or they'll keep asking me for money.", "NTA. In the future it might be wise to tell her that the money you have saved cannot be touched until (a certain year in the far future) unless it is for a down payment for a house.", "NTA. I've had friends that were lent money and it took them over a year to pay the bill back Some just outright refused to pay me back.

Keep making wise decisions.  Loans like this ruin relationships.", "NTA, you saved that money not to lend it, especially with that roommate having difficulty paying back", "NTA, you aren't her bank and her financial responsibility isn't your problem. \n\nIf you give in and are dumb enough to actually lend her that $800 you won't ever get it back.", "NTA It is your money. Do what you want with it.", "NTA Her financial irresponsibility isn't your responsibility. You were responsible and saved your money, she wasted hers on garbage. Even over her own needs. You likely won't see that money back if you do \"lend\" it to her. People like your friend tend to keep playing nice until the gravy train ends, and stiff you for your good intentions.

Once so she could get flights home because her mum was sick and she couldn\u2019t afford to go see her and once because her car broke down and I didn\u2019t even have to ask to be paid back the money was in my account as soon as it arrived in hers.
