I'd wager that the water bottle rule is in place to simultaneously make it so you aren't doing anything to humanize yourself to the customer, and more importantly to ensure that you don't ever have a second to yourself while working. This is inherently evil because it forces you to put your physical needs second. Doesn't matter that you were sick (morally, I mean.
