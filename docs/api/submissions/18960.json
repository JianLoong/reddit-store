As someone whose spouse worked as a pre-school teacher for a decade, OP did not overreact IMO.\n\nEven if her son had just had the mild reaction the sister claims he did, she should have informed OP promptly, so that OP could decide on whether further follow up medical check-up / treatment was needed.\n\nI think the E S H & Y T A comments are missing that an epipen is only intended to give time to seek further medical care.

My issue is more with the way she explained the situation to OP. Maybe the child did just get itchy so she used the pen like she said. Maybe the child had a more severe reaction which required the pen and she isn\u2019t saying that part. Either way she needed to tell mom that she used the pen and probably recommended mom take the child home just in case. \n\nI used to be a teacher. I\u2019ve had to call parents about their child\u2019s allergies, illnesses, and injuries before. I get it, things happen. But you never downplay an incident ever. You always be as detailed as possible, you never know if a reaction or injury is going to worsen later. I\u2019ve had kids slip during recess and what started as a bruised arm is later determined to be a fracture. The child had even said she felt fine. Even a nurse on staff can\u2019t make this determination. \n\nUsing a child\u2019s epipen also always needs to be disclosed to a parent.

Since the son wasn\u2019t an actual attendee of the daycare, I\u2019m guessing he wasn\u2019t *officially* registered & the room was out of ratio when he visited, which is probably the real reason SIL doesn\u2019t want reported because in most states, that\u2019s a *huge* licensing issue, like beyond fines.

Like someone above stated, it\u2019s buying time. \n\nBut people also think that if you administer CPR, the patient will wake up and say thank you afterwards. Nope.

Paperwork comes later, but it would still make sense for the urgent care/ER to call the parent.", "Daycares have to have you fill out all sorts of forms when registering and enrolling a child there. One of those forms is a release form allowing the daycare to 1) seek immediate medical intervention (take kid in an ambulance to the hospital) in an emergency and 2) contact the child's own pediatrician about said emergency (I aways figured to keep the pediatrician informed about their patient's health and in case they were going to go to the hospital to see the kid themselves--which assumes they have privileges at that hospital).", "Because she\u2019s the legal guardian of the children left in her care. That\u2019s how daycares work. Also schools. Daycare workers and teachers are authorized to seek emergency medical attention; they should immediately notify the parents once the child is stable and/or out of their care (EMT, nurse, doctor), not while the emergency is still actively an emergency they are dealing with. Every second counts, and not letting the physical caregiver initiate emergency medical care with medical practitioners just wastes time.", "Daycares and schools act \u201cin loco parentis,\u201d meaning they act as the parents when the parents aren\u2019t there. So if a child breaks their leg on the playground (for example) someone from the school can authorize emergency treatment for the child if the parents cannot be contacted immediately. Parents sign paperwork to this effect when they enroll their kids in schools or daycares. I cannot imagine a parent not wanting their kids to get bunged into an ambulance and whisked to a hospital in an emergency. As a (former) ER nurse, an adult from the school always accompanied any hurt/sick kids we got in our department. By law, EDs in the US have to treat anyone who comes through the doors who\u2019s experiencing a medical emergency, no matter their age, and at minimum stabilize the patient. We always prefer to speak directly with a parent/guardian about treatment, but we\u2019re not going to wait if a kid is in anaphylaxis, like OPs child in this instance.
