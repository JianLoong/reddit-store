Did he go to hospital? (and if not why not epi pens are to keep you alive till you get assessment and treatment not the treatment itself)   \n\n\nShe needs investigation  and ensuring she is fully compliant with all necessary polices and proceedures  for the sake of the children in her care.", "NTA. I cannot fathom how people do not see how SIL was 100% the a-hole. Your child had a medical emergency. She should have notified you the second it happened.  Your child came extremely close to dying which is wildly different than just a little itchy.\n\n\nYou were completely in the right for reporting her because what else is she not reporting to parents?

If we administer an epipen, we are required to immediately call emergency services.", "NTA. As a teacher, I cannot begin to fathom having a child have a serious medical emergency under my care (because that's what needing an epipen is) and not telling the parent. Your SIL is playing with fire.", "NTA I was thinking of how something like this would play out in my own family and then realized it would never happen because the caregiver would have called the parent-relative immediately. Something minor(!) happened twice while my parents were watching the grandkids - a black eye from a face first fall and a swallowed pill that was forgotten in a purse, which thankfully was low dose and caused no harm. The first call was to my sister to make sure she knew and that they could do whatever she wanted for treatment and then the second call was to me because my mom couldn\u2019t stop crying from the guilt that the kids got hurt while she and dad were in charge. To pretend it never happened? They\u2019d be too upset with themselves to not take whatever anger or upset my sister might have thrown at them head on. And she did. Said some hurtful things that she later apologized for. But they didn\u2019t protest, just took it in because they felt horrible. Your SIL should feel bad but it seems she was more focused on not getting caught than making sure your son had proper follow up treatment/monitoring", "NTA, honestly i hope none of the yta or esh vote have children, because the idea that you believe its okay to not tell someone their child almost died because anaphylaxis can kill you, is a Major AH. like if you wouldnt report that your own family, then what are you not reporting to the people who pay you?", "NTA\nI have a mild nut allergy and don\u2019t need epipens. I do know how they work though. \nBut soooo many of the comments clearly do not know how they work or that you need to go the ER after using them.\nYour SIL put your child at risk, advertising a nut-free daycare and yet your kid got peanut butter. Doesn\u2019t matter if she or someone else brought it - she advertised the place as nut-free and you should be able to trust that she and EVERY PARENT follows through on that. Because your kid could die if they don\u2019t.\nBut for me the reason why I think you would ve totally right to report her is that she lied to you and downplayed the whole thing.\n\nImagine you hadn\u2019t realised an epi was missing from his bag. Imagine it happened again. Imagine if there was no epi because you had not been informed that they had been used. \n\nSeriously NTA and every saying you are, are out of their minds.", "Aren\u2019t daycares supposed to be nut-free?", "As a parent of a child who has anaphylaxis from food allergies, if you have to use the epi pen you call 911 at the same time.", "OP, was the peanut butter from SIL's kitchen, or some other kid's lunchbox or something? How exactly did your kid end up eating it?\n\nHow do you know it was worse than a rash and itchiness? Did you speak to the doctors who treated your son, or did you infer the severity of the reaction from the missing epipen? Could she have used it \"just in case\" regardless of how bad or okay it looked, because that's what she knows she needs to immediately do, then seek medical care?\n\nYou seem angry, and you're right to be afraid for your child and angry... but not at her until you know exactly what happened.", "INFO: What exactly did you report? \n\n> My SIL did take him to get medical attention\n\n> I found only one, instead of the usual two epinephrine injectors I keep\n\nShe treated the reaction. She sought medical care. So you reported that she properly handled a medical emergency? Or that she properly handled a medical emergency but then didn\u2019t tell you the full truth after the fact? \n\nI get being upset that she downplayed the situation, but reporting her to authorities when your son is fine? That\u2019s extreme, and probably makes the entire family weary of helping out with your son ever again and damages her livelihood. \n\nESH, but you are definitely more the AH than your SIL.", "ESH. \n\nYour SIL absolutely should have been upfront with you. She should never have hidden such a serious incident.  That being said, she obviously appropriately treated the incident, took him for medical attention and used the epi pen and your son returned to you in good health. She disclosed there was an incident, just not the severity.\n\nThen, you took it upon yourself to try to take away your SIL\u2019s livelihood by reporting her business. That\u2019s a really extreme action and a very harsh thing to do to a family member who voluntarily cares for your child. I get that she fucked up, but ultimately your son is fine. You aren\u2019t obligated to leave your son with her again. Surely communication was the better way to go than torching your relationship with your in-laws.", "ESH. \n\nSIL should absolutely take things like an anaphylactic reaction seriously, but jumping straight to reporting the daycare is a bit of an overreaction. Have you spoken to her about what made her think she could handle it, as opposed to taking him to the hospital?", "ESH. \n\nYour SIL should have paid better attention and shouldn't have hid the entire truth from you. \n\nBut she was doing you a favour and did contain the situation. Reporting her and making her lose her livelihood over this favour seems a bit AH.", "YWBTA.  TALK to SIL.  Ask why he was given peanut butter in a nut free environment.  Jumping straight to calling the authorities is way out of line.  \nBe clear about your concerns but don\u2019t put her business in jeopardy.", "YTA,  if your SIL advertises nut free she assuredly didn't buy the peanut butter herself.   She also watches your kid free and after hours.   Rather than try to hide it, she used the epi, likely immediately as a precaution and certainly could have seen only a rash.   You keep epi just in case but try to destroy her life for using it.   \n\n\nNo matter what your childcare is probably gone for good.\n\nedit:  and using the use of epi as your evidence is a horrible thin to do.   You want people to avoid using the epi until there is no other choice and it could be too late?", "yta. your sil is doing a favor and working more for free for you. she took care of your kid, sought medical attention, and ensured he was fine. you reported her unnecessarily and ruined her livelihood. she did her diligence and made sure your kid was fine by completing all the first aid steps.", "ESH - You knew or should have known they were using peanut butter and you chose to take the risk. You have a duty to your child that you can't put off on someone else. You knew it was a possibility he would be exposed. It's a bunch of kids who are gonna be messy and it's unreasonable for you to claim that you're entirely blameless what happened. You reported her daycare, threatening her livelihood and the financial stability of your brother's family because SIL minimized the incident. Your anger is such because you can't acknowledge that you chose free daycare over your child's safety.\n\nSIL should not have downplayed the severity of his reaction. It's medical information that is vital to a parent's ability to care for their child. Other than that, SIL did the right thing.\n\nI say you're overreacting because you're trying to shift all the responsibility onto SIL when you knew or should have known that there was peanut butter being served. It was a known risk that you took. SIL did the right thing with the exception of minimizing the severity of his reaction, yet your response is to try and destroy her business (don't say \"I'm not trying to...\" because you made the complaint knowing that the loss of her business is a possibility).", "YTA - if you where a paying customer yes.

He was helping YOU for mknths-and this was an accident.\n\nYou DO know that from now on, you are no longer entitled to any help from your sil whatsoever? The daycare closes at 3, you pick your son up at 3. No more extra hours.

As someone whose spouse worked as a pre-school teacher for a decade, OP did not overreact IMO.\n\nEven if her son had just had the mild reaction the sister claims he did, she should have informed OP promptly, so that OP could decide on whether further follow up medical check-up / treatment was needed.\n\nI think the E S H & Y T A comments are missing that an epipen is only intended to give time to seek further medical care. That you don't just use it and call it good.\n\nOP needed to be brought into the loop of what was going on as soon as realistically possible. Not have the incident downplayed and only find out the real extent days later.\n\nAnd this is even before considering the factor that by failing to tell OP about the use of the epipen, the safety factor of keeping 2 on hand, as OP does was gone. If something had happened to cause a severe reaction in OPs son before the missing one had been discovered abd replaced, it could have contributed to a very bad outcome.\n\nPlus, some are making it sound like OP is going to cause her sister to lose her business by reporting her. When the reality is that, if one report is enough to get the authorities to shut the daycare down, it means that it was operating so far outside of the proper regulations that shutting it down is the only option that the authorities had. ie. that if the sister gets shut down, its because that's what needed to happen\n\nThat just like with a lot of other stuff, a single report will normally only cause a review, some increased monitoring and maybe some instructions to change certain practices and/or a fine.\n\nOP is NTA", "Exactly. An epipen isn\u2019t like Benadryl. If you use one, then you call 911 and get monitored for more severe reactions. \n\nAnd if she doesn\u2019t know that, she shouldn\u2019t have kids under her care as her profession.

Since her kiddo was taken to somewhere for \"medical attentjon\" she should get his visit report and go from there.
