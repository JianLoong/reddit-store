As someone whose spouse worked as a pre-school teacher for a decade, OP did not overreact IMO.\n\nEven if her son had just had the mild reaction the sister claims he did, she should have informed OP promptly, so that OP could decide on whether further follow up medical check-up / treatment was needed.\n\nI think the E S H & Y T A comments are missing that an epipen is only intended to give time to seek further medical care. That you don't just use it and call it good.\n\nOP needed to be brought into the loop of what was going on as soon as realistically possible. Not have the incident downplayed and only find out the real extent days later.\n\nAnd this is even before considering the factor that by failing to tell OP about the use of the epipen, the safety factor of keeping 2 on hand, as OP does was gone.

The fact that SIL doesn't understand this means she shouldn't be watching children.", "Having to use an epipen is literally a major medical emergency. It's pretty obvious that you know very little about anaphylaxis and epipens.", "Yo mama", "I would lose my job for trying to pull something like this (teacher). And rightfully so. You do not LIE about a child in your care having a MEDICAL EMERGENCY. Who cares if OP is now going to have a hard time finding child care? Yes, it will greatly affect her life, but SIL has just proven she can't be trusted. The issue is not the exposure, accidents can and will happen. The issue is the lying.", "Giving an epipen is still a medical emergency. Epipens are literally meant to give you enough time to get to the hospital. It is literally what they are for. What if OP had taken her son home, and then he'd started having a reaction later when the epipen wore off? OP wouldn't have been prepared, since she didn't know the reaction had been severe enough to warrant an epipen given what SIL had told her. Not to mention, SIL used important and expensive medical equipment and didn't let OP know that it had been used and needed to be replaced. What if, days, weeks, months later, OP's son had another exposure and had a bad reaction, one requiring two epipens to help him make it to the hospital alive? SIL could have killed OP's son in more ways than one here.", "In a job where you need to take care of something, you would want somebody capable of taking care of said thing, correct?", "Even if it was \u201cjust a rash\u201d using an epipen gives side effects of its own.  The child would still need to go to the ER.  It is good that she used the epipen, but BAD that she did not tell the mom that her son was in hurt and in the ER.", "Sorry.  I didn\u2019t know that.", "Stop. Legumes are NOT nuts. There is PEANUT which is a legume allergy and NUT allergy which includes coconut.", "Not necessarily, I had to take my niece to the hospital for a shoulder injury when I was babysitting and her parents were in another state.", "OP added that after I posted. \\*\\*shrug\\*\\*", "Could be valid points, but relies on assumptions not made in the OP.", "And nothing suggests that the op's sil isn't capable of taking care of the children she's paid to look after for her JOB.", "Oh stop it. \"Nut free\" includes peanuts when you're talking to parents of kids with allergies.", "While not technically a nut it is commonly considered the most common nut allergy. Also I don\u2019t really care about technicalities when it comes to the health and safety of children.", "It relies on assumptions because the SIL told OP nothing. Only that he \"had a rash.\" I cannot even begin to understand why you think that is ok.", "\u201cYou might just as well say,\u201d added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, \u201cthat 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I sleep when I breathe'!\u201d \u201cTut, tut, child!\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cEverything's got a moral, if only you can find it.\u201d", "Our allergist made a point to us that our kid's allergy to peanuts is not a nut allergy and that it was important to make the distinction when looking at allergens list of ingredients. My daughter can have nuts, she is just allergic to peanuts which is from a totally different family of foods. She was tested for other foods, including the most popular nuts, and she isn't allergic at all.", "But it's a lie. You're justifying telling a lie and presenting that lie as false advertising.", "I do understand that a peanut allergy doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re allergic to all nuts. I\u2019m glad you have a great doctor I\u2019m thinking more in terms of how a nut free zone also includes peanuts to a lot of people. I shouldn\u2019t have said it doesn\u2019t matter but more that it\u2019s so commonly thought of as together and while people should have the correct knowledge the people who don\u2019t can suffer horribly because of it. I do apologize for not explaining myself properly I got a little worked up", "No I\u2019m saying that if someone advertises that a place is nut free I\u2019m going to assume that peanuts are included. I\u2019ve never seen a school or daycare have no legume signs posted. However there are tons of no nut signs that have various forms of peanuts because while they may be classified as a legume because they grow underground that doesn\u2019t matter in terms of someone could die because someone else wanted to be technically right."]}
