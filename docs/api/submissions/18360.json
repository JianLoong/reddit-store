I(28M) have been the legal guardian of my niece(17f) for the last two-ish years. So when my niece was born and until I was 20 and moved out of state. I was pretty involved in her life. My older brother that struggles with substance abuse had a daughter He lived in various apartments/motels with my niece. Sometimes he'd leave her with my parents for months/weeks. My parents have their issues as well so it's never really been a good stable life for her or any of my siblings and cousins. I always tried my best to look out for her when I was around. I worked a pizza shop in as a teen and I'd bring her home a pizza or pastries when I could. We'd play video games and do things together. Even when I was in college I would always make time for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGot my tech degree and certifications. Moved out of state for a good job making 35k a year at first. Now I bring in 110k on salary but also get frequent bonuses + benefits and a groceries & gas paid for. I'm putting this here because my income is brought up A LOT by my relatives. The state took my niece away from my brother. They were going to have her stay with my parents or my aunt(both not good living situations) but I opted to take her in. I had to go through all the steps and show my income & living situation and why it'd be better for her to live with me. She's been living with me the last two-ish years and it's been great. She has her own room for the first time. And I will admit. I do buy her things she wants. But she never makes outrageous requests. I just think about me as a kid having to save up for a whole year to buy a single video game and how I can just buy her any game whenever. She asked me for parts of a gaming desktop, I bought them and she put it all together herself. If she's out with friends I Zelle her money without her having to ask. She's a good kid. Sure she has some emotional issues to work through but she's good and kind. Even if she weren't I don't want her out there broke.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother is pissed at me for \"taking his little girl away.\" My parents and aunt are pissed that they can't have her. It has not been proven I suspect that they just want the government assistance that would come with it. I could just be looking at them judgmentally though, but I grew up with them. My niece posts pictures on instagram from where we live. She will post pictures of our outings and I always get snippy calls and messages from them that I am spoiling her and making them hate her. I got EXTREME hate when I got her a car a couple of months ago. They think I am doing this to rub it in their face which maybe I am. I don't send pictures or give them updates but I do enjoy knowing that she is living a better life.

And sharing your success with your niece too. NTA, OP. BUT, I would talk to some parents who have raised more children to be successful, responsible adults about what spoiling a kid is and what isn't. Or at least read the part about kids of the book 'Millionaire next door' by drs Stanley and Danko (in fact I recommend the book in its entirety, you can find it online for free, it's a bit old but evergreen). You want to reward success (which is not spoiling) and not create entitlement (which can be created in the nicest kid if you try long enough). Best of luck!", "NTA.
