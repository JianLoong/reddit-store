My brother is now 23.\n\nBefore his 21st birthday I wanted to find a picture of us as kids to print on a birthday card. I knew he had posted one a while ago on instagram so I went to his profile. The first thing I saw was his bio with a link tree in it. I shouldn\u2019t have clicked but I did. \n\nNot only was there a link to his only fans but there were links to Pornhub & other porn sites. I closed the app and spoke to my work bestie. I asked her look and she confirmed it was actually him and he was working for a well known porn company.\n\nHe was a uni student studying drama and he had told family he had some \u2018acting jobs\u2019 he \u2018couldn\u2019t tell us much about\u2019.  I assumed he was doing well  and was really excited for him as we aren\u2019t a rich family and we both had to work a near full time job to pay our own rent whilst at Uni.\nI respected the fact that he clearly didn\u2019t want to tell us about his real job (just a bit of a cringey thing to admit to family I suppose). I kept it to myself until I could see him alone in person. I had some concerns as he is so young and a protective part of me kicked in as his big sister. \n\nI reflected on it and thought, he is of age and I lots of people do only fans now (cool with me if the persons happy doing it - your body your choice/ whatever)\n\nAfter his birthday party, he and I stayed overnight at our parent\u2019s house and I mustered up the courage to speak to him. I asked directly \u2018what are you doing for work\u2019 without hesitation he chuckled and said \u2018you know what I do or you wouldn\u2019t be asking me in private\u2019. I explained how I found out and he was quite unbothered but did say \u2018don\u2019t tell mum and dad or gossip to family\u2019 and proceeded to say he is serious about the porn career and only wants to tell them when \u2018the time is right\u2019 . \n\nFast forward 2 years he still hasn\u2019t told my mum and dad. My brother has become increasingly distant from us. My parents are so proud (they think he is getting acting jobs alongside doing his masters degree) but my mum (who I\u2019m close to) has said she is starting to feel like she knows nothing about him anymore and would love for him to give her a call sometimes. It\u2019s clear my dad is upset too but doesn\u2019t vocalise it.\n\nI still have managed to keep it a secret all this time, and I am starting to feel bad for withholding this from my parents. I would hate for my parents to find out I have known all along.\n\nFortunately my parents and family only use Facebook and I believe I was his only relative who followed my brother\u2019s instagram (I have since unfollowed as I don\u2019t want to see certain stories he is posting for obvious reasons) - so my family shouldn\u2019t stumble upon this information easily.\n\nI keep telling my brother it\u2019s time to fess up  before they find out and he assures me he will \u2018at some point\u2019 but never does.\n\nAm I the asshole for not telling my parents / am I the asshole if I tell my parents and betray his trust?", "created_utc": 1682696294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131y64l/aita_for_not_telling_my_parents_my_brother_does/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know it's hard to see your mum hurting as she feels he's drifting away, and that there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nAnd, the problem is, telling her about his job isn't going to help. First, it'd betray his trust, so it's not going to help your relationship. And it's probably not going to help his relationship with your parents either.\n\nThis is really up to him to do.

You should avoid revealing other people\u2019s secret in general. \n\nAs long as he\u2019s not in danger, it\u2019s his choice.

Not your job to spread around another adults business.", "You would be the AH if you snitch on him, its not your field of work, its his.  \nAlso he is an adult and so just let him be and don't break his trust. There is a reason why he didn't tell anyone.", "NTA- this is NOT your news to tell. He wanted them to know, he would tell them.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your secret to tell. \n\nI am a little worried that your brother is apparently using his real name in his porn career - like, if his personal Instagram is also a \u201cwork\u201d account, that seems risky from a personal safety perspective. Plus it\u2019s only a matter of time til your family finds out if he\u2019s a Google search away from being outed.", "NTA\n\nIt is not your place to tell your parents, and it would be a betrayal of your brother to do so.\n\nYou have given your brother good advice to talk to your parents. You can share with him how your parents are feeling disconnected from his life and it is hurting them. Ultimately, though, it is his decision.", "NTA \n\nI don't think adults are obligated to share everything with their parents, especially if it is about their sex life or their job. This involves both. For whatever reason, your brother doesn't want his parents to know he's a sex worker. For context, think about all the posts we see here from parents who find out their children are sex workers and then proceed to systematically ruin their lives to \"protect\" them. Maybe your parents wouldn't, but your brother can't know for sure. It should be his choice when and how to tell your parents. \n\nTattling isn't cool when you're kids and it's also a terrible look for adult siblings.", "NTA, you will be the asshole if you tell them.  It\u2019s not your business and is not relevant to anything.", "NTA - It\u2019s his business. If parents find out you knew they might be unhappy for a bit that you let them be in ignorance, but if I was them I\u2019d have to admit you\u2019re a person of integrity and to be trusted and that in my book is worth more than some temporary upset", "NTA.  \nit's not really your responsibility to tell them. But i don't think you should confess to your parents that you knew about it when they didn't, if the topic ever comes up.", "NTA for not telling them, but you are for pressuring him to. Why is it so important for them to know something that they will not understand? Why break their hearts and the relationship with your brother beyond repair? Why is any of this your business? He\u2019s supporting himself, so who cares how he does it? I understand that it\u2019s a worrisome industry in terms of drug use and possible STDs, but your brother should feel comfortable coming to you for help if that what he needs rather than judged and less than because of what he\u2019s chosen to do.", "NTA - It\u2019s not your place to tell them, you are being a really good big sister by keeping this for yourself. He\u2019ll tell them when I\u2019ll be ready !", "NTA\u2026 for now. You are not the AH for *not* telling your parents; but you would most certainly be one if you did tell them. \n\nMind your own business. You don\u2019t need to be harassing your brother about telling your parents. He should be able to tell them if he\u2019s ready. \n\nRule of thumb, if it\u2019s not impacting your life - not your news to share.", "It's not your job to share this with them, and honestly with how private you can keep everything, there's a huge chance they never find out. You'd be a massive AH for telling them that without his permission - and honestly, it's likely that the job has NOTHING to do with the feeling of distance. People are more than their profession, and that feeling of knowing nothing about him is definitely deeper than what he does for money. Telling them solves nothing but to alienate your brother from your family.", "YWBTA if you told them. It\u2019s none of your parents business or yours. The relationship he has with your parents is a separate issue and has nothing to do with his career imo.", "NTA.\nWhile I think it's dangerous and puts him at risk, he's an adult. It's his choice. He also doesn't need to tell anyone he doesn't want to.", "NTA... yet. He's an adult. If he doesn't want his parents to know, that's he choice. Telling them against his wishes would make you the AH.", "NTA\n\nIn fact you would be TA if you abused his confidence and told your parents something that they would undoubtedly find upsetting/disturbing. He is an adult and has not been coerced into working in adult films. I don\u2019t think you are TA for trying to get him to tell them as it is likely that they will eventually find out but you\u2019ve said your piece and should drop it going forward. Stop worrying about all of this. It is really not your business. It is what it is and you cannot control any of it - not his choices, not your parents\u2019 reaction, you can only control your own behavior- let it go.\n\nThe real issue here is that you are worried about blow back and blame landing on you once they do find out and find out that you knew. You cannot control this either and, again, breaking confidence is a bad idea and will not protect you from the blame and could likely make it much worse.", "YWBTA if you told your parents. Maybe try and talk to him about seeing your parents more, however if he had been in the porn industry this long, I would be worried about the darker side of things. Drugs, mental health, abuse are all common in the sex industry. I would try and reach out to make sure he is ok. However it is still his choice and you shouldn't tell anyone what he did unless he gives you permission to do so.", "NTA. But YWBTA if you tell the parents. It\u2019s your brother\u2019s life. He should tell them. It would be a big breach of trust to tell your parents and I could see how it would hurt his family relaitionships. \n\nThe job is kindaaaaa irrelevant. This is more about your brother being distance. Every mom gets sad when they\u2019re son doesn\u2019t call. He could tell them about his life, not his work. And he\u2019s not doing that. Them knowing about his work won\u2019t solve anything\u2026.it\u2019s not like they\u2019re gonna suddenly have a bunch of small talk or questions about that they can talk about. \n\nYou could talk to him and tell him his parents want to be closer to him and would appreciate calls to check in every Sunday. It\u2019s not your job to do so, but maybe he doesn\u2019t know how much he\u2019s been hurting them. Or maybe he\u2019s being distant on purpose & you can\u2019t force him to be closer to everyone. \n\nMaybe your parents or you should call him more if they want to be close. \n\nI\u2019ll say it is weird he puts it publicly in his instagram if he doesn\u2019t want people to know. But idk, advertising works, and obviously it\u2019s worked fine for family that doesn\u2019t check. It doesn\u2019t give you a freebie to tell everyone IMO", "NAH\u2014 if your brother is linking to his porn on his insta then he can\u2019t really care too much about family finding out. I wouldn\u2019t go out of the way to tell your parents since it can only cause drama and conflict but honestly it\u2019s just a matter of time before someone tells them. Surprised it hasn\u2019t happened already. Just play dumb when the time comes and act like you are finding out for the first time.", "NTA. Unless you feel like his safety is in actual jeopardy, it\u2019s his business and he can share it when he\u2019s ready.", "NTA for not telling them, but your brother doesn't really have the right to demand your outright lie to them. Which, as far as I understand you don't have to do, at the moment. \nHave you tried telling your brother that keeping his secret is straining your relationship with your parents?", "YWBT-A if you told your parents. This is your brother\u2019s secret, and he explicitly asked you not to tell them. You would be betraying his trust by exposing him to your parents. \n\nNTA for keeping the secret so far. Don\u2019t break now. If he wanted them to know, he can tell them himself.", "PS is he actually getting a master\u2019s degree? \n\nIt sucks he\u2019s lying about acting but hopefully he\u2019s not lying tooooo much over the top. I think it\u2019s fine to be vague about acting.", "Soft NTA.   You already brought in your work bestie so there\u2019s a chance they have either already told somebody else or possibly will tell somebody if you 2 get into a fight.   \nPlease don\u2019t share this with anybody else unless you want your family to find out (which you may and are posting on here to find validation and in doing it)", "Absolutely do not tell them. However you do need to tell your brother you feel in the middle and that while you won\u2019t betray his confidence, he needs to figure something out to placate the parents a little with some more contact or whatever bc right now - you are covering for him and taking the brunt of the consequences of his actions, which isn\u2019t fair to you either.", "Obvious you would be a massive AH if you told your parents. It\u2019s not your place to tell them it\u2019s down to him, stay out of it don\u2019t meddle in their relationship.", "NTA - This is a no win scenario.  Your brother is an asshole by not telling your parents and by telling you not to tell them, thus forcing you into a lie.  You've now held this secret for 2 years and when it comes out your parents will undoubtedly learn that you've known, so by withholding it you likely have permanently damaged your relationship with them.\n\nI feel bad that you got trapped in the middle here, but no matter which way you went, you'd be betraying someone and it is your brother's fault, ultimately, that you may have ruined your relationship with your parents.\n\nOf course, there is a chance everything works out in the end, but in reality that doesn't happen as often as we'd like.", "YWBTA If you told the parents. It's not your place. Leave that up to him to manage.", "YTA. This is not your information to share. Why do you need to say anything anyway? It won't help anything. You've held the news this long, so if your parents are going to be cross with you it os too late.", "YWBTA\n\nIf you told them. Speak candidly with your brother if you are close and feel like it needs to be talked about but at the end of the day it is his life. Let him do what he wants to do and accept the consequences or benefits.", "YWBTA if you told others. This is something your family doesn\u2019t need to know. It might even be their \u2018right\u2019 not to know - since I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t want to picture their son doing anything sexual.\n\nBut you can still encourage him to talk to them more. I can imagine it\u2019s tricky when he\u2019s lied about having acting jobs and they would love to know about them! (Which makes me think there\u2019s a risk they WOULD google his name to see if he\u2019s listed in the credits somewhere.)\n\nPersonally I\u2019d encourage him to hide his links better and come up with some hobbies or censored descriptions of the \u2018films\u2019 he\u2019s doing so the family doesn\u2019t go searching for themselves.", "YTA if you tell your parents. You're harassing your brother about it to relieve YOUR guilt over not telling them. If you tell them, he'll never trust you again. He's an adult and he gets to decide for himself. Don't prevent him from making his own choices. But NTA for not telling them.", "Don\u2019t be a rat", "Any time a person is enlisting someone to lie for them or join them in a lie of omission---especially to family---I think they're assholes, and that's your brother. In your place I would have given my brother a period of a few months to discuss it himself with the parents.\n\nYour parents will eventually find out: both about the porn career and the fact that you knew about it.  Get ready for the consequences to your relationship with them.\n\nYou asked AITA opposing questions in the title and at the end of your post so no way to give a judgment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
