This house was very close to my uni and basically had the bare minimum maintenance in order to have cheap students living there. We paid 50% utilities which is already pretty high for a basement suite. \n\nAbout a month after we moved in, a middle aged lady with a tesla moved in (despite the fact we were told students would move in upstairs to make the living situation more compatible). We specifically asked if she would be charging it at the house and were told no. We expressed concerns that we would end up paying for her to charge her car and didnt want that to happen. Despite assurances from our slimey property manager, she started charging the car there and our utility bill was massive. It ended up blowing the breaker on 3/4 of our suite because for some reason the garage was on the same breaker as the majority of the basement. We again brought up concerns about footing the bill for a car that did not belong to us and brought up the safety hazzard an electric car imposes on a house built in the 1920s (ie an electrical fire in a space with little egress). After that both the upstairs neighbor and our property manager began harrassing us, threatening legal action, and we spent multiple weeks without electricty. It was an absolute nightmare. \n\nPersonal story aside, I ended up with a ridiculous amount of knowledge about property and rental law. I don't know where you're from, but there should be legal means by which you can raise the rent without the tenants consent (with proper notice). If you can, give notice and raise his rent by the difference in the utility bill.\n\nEdit to add - I just noticed you specifically say \"lodger\" and that you are just renting out rooms. The law is likely even more in your favor and if he won't pay the difference it shouldn't be difficult to have him evicted.

A) in most places it is legal for landlords to raise rent with notice. B) this guy is a lodger, not a tenant, so OP has a lot more legal protection than a typical landlord.", "I can't speak to the legal aspect of the situation, but I feel like, morally, OP actually does have a leg to stand on here. \n\nFirst off, he knew the guy beforehand, so this wasn't *exclusively* a business transaction as he might not have felt comfortable renting a room in the home he lives in to a total stranger of questionable character. \n\nSecond, he's renting out a room and not a full unit. OP lives in the same unit, so this is more of a roommate/subletter arrangement than a standard landlord/tenant. When OP said that electric was included a reasonable person would have interpreted that to mean that full time use of power-drawing appliances in the *room* being rented was included and reasonable non-exclusive use of devices in shared common spaces (stuff like TV in living room, toaster in kitchen). If tenant were running a 1500w toaster 24/7 in the kitchen that would also be clearly unreasonable. \n\nI'm assuming this guy isn't plugging his EV into the bedroom wall outlet. Depending on the circuitry of the house it's entirely possible that all the wall outlets in the bedroom are on one circuit (likely only 15A, too) or maybe even shared with another room, which would force the roommate to choose between using appliances like a computer, lights, fans, etc. and charging his car effectively.\n\nIf I were OP I would make the argument that roommate can use the outlets in *his own room* according to the agreement but that he isn't entitled to full use of outlets in the common spaces. Maybe lock up the outlets that are accessible from roommate's parking spot or plug other low-power devices into all of them (OP should be just as entitled to use those outlets as anyone else in the house).
