Sounds like bullshit.", "NTA. Tell him he can't charge his car on premises. That's what my last landlord did for a tenant who switched to all-electric. \n\nThe tenant still saved money, but not nearly as much as if they'd fobbed it all off on the landlord.", "NTA.\n\nHe can either pay for the energy he's using or he can stop charging his car there altogether. If he can afford to buy the car he can afford to charge it.", "NTA\n\nThe bill increased because of his car, he needs to pay the extra.", "NTA.  Conversation hasn't worked so now it's time to evict him.  He should be paying for all of the electricity he is using.  Best wishes.", "NTA.  Formalize a change to the terms of his tenancy in whatever format this is for your area. Specifically exclude charging electric vehicles unless a separate fee is paid.  If he won't agree, terminate the tenancy.\n\nYou might look into a portable meter that records use and make him plug into that?  I don't know if those a generally available.", "This might be a good question for the r/legaladvice subs.  I believe there's a separate UK sub as well.", "NTA, but, a better approach *might* be to disable whatever outlets are used for that charging.  I mean, he's not running an extension cord through an open window, right?\n\nIf you can't do that, you might just have to live with it up until lease renewal time.", "It's not really a matter of what he can or cannot afford. If you agreed to rent the room \"all bills included\" and that included electricity, then he doesn't need to pay you any extra.\n\nYou weren't an asshole to *ask*, but it's (apparently) within his rights to refuse. Do review your lease carefully to determine whether it covers this sort of situation; there might be a monthly cap on expenditures. \n\nDon't renew his lease when it expires, and make sure you have something in your lease terms to address this situation for future tenants. Or just raise the rent (when his current lease expires) to cover the extra amount.", "NTA\n\nSince the agreement is \"all utilities included\" you can't ask for additional money for electricity.  However, if he's on a month-to-month tenancy, you CAN inform him in writing that in 30 days his rent is increasing by \u00a3X per month and that he can either pay the increased rent or move out.  Another option is to block access to the outlets needed to charge his vehicle so that he's literally unable to charge the vehicle at your home.  Electric vehicles typically use different outlets than standard household electrics so there are probably only a few of them in your home.  You could install a lockbox over whichever one he's using for the vehicle.", "NTA. \"Bills included\" is obviously based on reasonable usage. I drive electric myself, and a charge is about 50-60 kwh. That's like leaving your washer _and_ dryer running 24/7.\nYou wouldn't allow them to run a bitcoin mining operation either. What's next? He'll charge people \u00a310 to come charge their cars too, since he's \"paid for all electricity\" anyways?", "Time to find locking plates for all outlets that he could possibly use.", "Its tough because he did rent it \"all bills included\" but it also sounds like he's taking advantage of it. He's no longer paying any fuel expenses.\n\nI'd talk to him again, say that before all bills were included but the situation has changed since he is charging his vehicle at home. He should pay a fair amount for that usage\n\nNTA", "NTA - He's shifting his costs onto you. He did not have the electric car upon entering a deal with you. If he doesn't compensate you, kill the circuit breaker to the outlets he's using to charge the car, or it could be worth beginning the eviction process", "NTA, but depending on your local laws you may not have many options other than to evict him if your lease agreement says all utilities are included.", "NTA\n\nYou agreed to rent the rooms \"all bills included\" but there has to be reasonable limits even if not specified in writing.  If he wanted to start a side business in his rooms bottling and selling water from the tap, that is not normal expected behavior for tenants and would be taking advantage of the landlord who pays the water bill.  Likewise, the electricity is provided for habitation purposes, not transportation.", "NTA\n\nHe still needs to pay his fuel, it now being electricity. If he insists, It's time to boot him.", "NTA. The highly increased electric bill wasn't part of your original agreement. He changed the agreement without speaking to you and should definitely have to cover the overages he's causing. It's super nice of you to do what you're doing and he should not be taking advantage of you.", "Unplug the car every time you see it plugged in. Find a way to prevent him from charging his car until he forks up the money", "NTA\nIf he was able to pay for fuel, he is also able to pay for charging his car", "NTA. Maybe you can change the set up for people to pay for their own utilities. \n\nWe have to pay for our electricity. The landlord pays water and garbage. \n\nAt one time, we were told there was excessive water usage in the building, and we were told if this remained the case all our rents would be raised. So you could raise the rent, depending on what kind of agreement you have.", "NTA. Don't allow him to charge his vehicle at your house anymore.", "NAH. All bills included means all bills included. If that no longer works for you, you have the right as his landlord to raise his rent. And likewise, he has the right as a tenant to force you to go through the proper procedure to raise his rent, what ever that is in your area.", "YTA. If you rented out the room all bills included you can\u2019t now ask for more money, I don\u2019t know if you have a contract with him but you would need to account for something like this in that and set the rent accordingly.", "YTA, maybe. Do you have a lease with him?  (Obligatory I am not a lawyer.) If the lease states that utilities are included and doesn\u2019t make provisions for excessive usage, I don\u2019t think you can force him to pay. Morally, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s bullshit. But legally?  I don\u2019t know. Id definitely update the lease when it comes time to renew.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

All was hunky dory for 8 years with his landlord. My husband never missed any rent and was the landlord's best tenant. A Romanian family moved into a couple of the other rooms and suddenly landlord's electricity bill went through the roof.\n\nIn the end, landlord not only charged them more rent (he didn't charge hubby because he knew from the last 8 years it wasn't him using the electricity to that extent) and he had to install a prepayment meter. I think in all, over 4 years, they racked up a \u00a310k debt but because they had a small child, they can't be cut off. My husband was put in charge of topping up the meter each week - landlord said that instead of sending him hubby's rent, he could use that cash to top up the meter, which he did. Because the Romanians wouldn't have topped it up and then everyone in the house would be without electricity.\n\n  \nEven now, 4 years later, landlord is still paying off the bill they racked up (and they left the house one night owing rent).\n\nYou might have to consider getting a meter put in if your tenant is using ridiculous amounts of electricity. Or ask him to leave / not renewing his tenancy lease. Also, who installed the electric charging point? Surely they need the homeowner's permission for that?", "INFO: what was the initial utility agreement or lease?", "NAH, bear with me..  \n\nTechnically he's right, if the contract says all bills paid, that includes his car charging. \n\nMorally I think it's more like you paying for central heating oil and him using it to fuel a diesel car for his commute. \n\nAs he's a lodger (different to being a tenant) , you only need to give him a few days notice for him to leave, make sure he knows that.", "But he's on the breadline... \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, this is more of a legal question than an AH question. A lot depends on the wording of the contract between them when it comes to all bill included. I think there's generally an assumption of \"reasonable usage\" but I'm not a lawyer.", "The lease doesn\u2019t actually matter because in the UK lodgers have very little protection compared to other renters. OP could just tell them they have to leave, or increase the rent to cover the electricity bill, and there is very little the guy could do about it. NTA OP, there\u2019s fair usage and charging an electric car ain\u2019t it.", "The car isn\u2019t being charged inside the apartment so why would that be considered an included bill? I\u2019d talk to a lawyer & start eviction proceedings ASAP. NTA", "NOPE, the outside electrical is NOT part of the rent.   OP should disconnect if he has to", "It's relatively piss easy to evict tenants in the UK compared to - say - the US. Most private tenants don't even have a contract.
