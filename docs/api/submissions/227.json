{"id": 227, "submission_id": "yizjdo", "title": "AITA for not moving away", "selftext": "So my brother (26m) moved back home with me (28f) in spring when his lease ended. We both live in a home owned by my parents, next door to my parents. It\u2019s a super average home, 2bd1ba. He moved back in to build up his credit and save money for a new place. He was only supposed to be here for 2 months. I didn\u2019t know he was moving in.  One day he was just in my home. There wasn\u2019t really a point to it since at the end of his lease, (he was unemployed for a month,) he got a great job that won\u2019t fire him plus a pay bonus and his refund check came all at the same time. We both pay marginal rent. So financial he was set. He never worked on his credit. He has no real bills, always borrowing money from my mom, and he doesn\u2019t pay for food, or take responsibility for his actions. He works his full 40. Every month, he\u2019ll ask me a finance or credit question. I\u2019d try to help him but he would just argue that he doesn\u2019t like talking about finances. So why ask me?? I truly believe he is a honest to god idiot. He got scammed by a Nigerian, in person. He doesn\u2019t believe in science. ANY science. Not just earth is flat stuff. I mean he tried talking my mother out the hospital after a heart attack because doctors, in his opinion, couldn\u2019t help her. We had JUST gotten to the ER! So this person lives with me and he has no intention on leaving. I am saved up for a house. My parents want me to stay home for the next few months and invest in our family business for another property instead. We work from home now and I often go to my parents to work every morning at 9. It\u2019s been really efficient lately. He is a non factor in the business. He is personally responsible for a contract we lost, and was fired twice. He cost people jobs. I can\u2019t live with him anymore but I want to stay in my home. He doesn\u2019t want to leave either. My parents won\u2019t kick him out, even though they\u2019ve made numerous threats. He is the worst neighbor and roommate. We have always constantly argued. I\u2019m just as bad for arguing and yelling. We just finished a round because I don\u2019t buy things he likes when I go to stores. He\u2019s never bought me anything. I don\u2019t get why he would expect this service. We have never gotten along. AITA for not leaving, stressing out when I can just go?", "created_utc": 1667279580, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yizjdo/aita_for_not_moving_away/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
