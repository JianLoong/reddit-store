Even if you don\u2019t want to cook, you still offer because that\u2019s the polite way to do it. If someone doesn\u2019t offer, or just stays where the others are sitting, some people (usually older more judgey) do consider it rude or snobby. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is a cultural thing on your end, so I can\u2019t really say fully. If it is, I think it\u2019s an ESH, situation. \n\nI personally don\u2019t believe in this type of dynamic, but a lot of ppl still uphold it.

It could also be the issue isn\u2019t the helping with cooking but the conversing that usually happens in the kitchen. She feels she\u2019s being snubbed. \n\nOn the flip side I think she had an overreaction once a compromise was discussed. I do think that you should\u2019ve spoken to your wife privately prior to agreeing to the compromise because it is embarrassing to your spouse when you go against what they are saying, especially when it\u2019s in front of the in-laws. \n\nWhen you married her, you chose to put her first as your family, and that includes situations like these.

She can\u2019t fix an issue she doesn\u2019t know exists. That being said I wouldn\u2019t bring it up now because asking someone to be quieter in their own home often sounds like you\u2019re saying that they are too much and they shouldn\u2019t be themselves.
