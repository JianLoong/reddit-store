This was hilarious! Who cares if gran doesn't get you a gift b/c you talked about a completely normal bodily function!", "NTA. Your grandma is just ovary-acting!", "NTA - however you are hilarious. To bad they can't see the fun of ot but you're 30 and can say and do whatever you want. If they get upset about something like this, just ignore until they get over themselves.", "NTA, that was hilarious and it gave them all the heebies. Bonus!

They need to loosen up.", "NTA\n\nIf your response had shown up on my feed you would have gotten a giant LMAO from me.\n\nAnd if your grandma is anything like mine when I was in my thirties, you might be better off without that Christmas present.

Blood is... just blood.", "HAHAHA...love it!", "Damn...lol!", "Either wait it's just pointless shit stirring.", "Do you think erections or ejaculations are somehow sexual?", "Period's are a mix of blood & flesh lining. To me that's a bodily function on the same level as poop", "Flesh lining? That sound really gross and is also a shade of colour.\n\nAnd there is ad different between Menstruation and pooping.", "There's a definite difference between the make up of the two, but at the end of the day both are bodily functions.", "But you said periode is the same level as poop? Which is isn't?", "To you maybe but in regards to humor and polite conversation I think joking about your period blood is the same level as joking about a fart/shit"]}
