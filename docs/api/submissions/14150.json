Im not a party animal, but I always want to go grab boba or go get a bite to eat or watch a movie or walk around the park or sit somewhere to watch the sunset or something. My issue is that he turns me down for things often or he\u2019s not very enthused about doing these things with me. It\u2019s caused a lot of friction over the years and it\u2019s what most of our arguments are about. Just two nights ago we had a heart to heart about how i need more enthusiasm and participation from him and he seemed to really understand where i was coming from. \n\nFast forward to today\u2014our favorite band is coming to NYC for a concert. My bf unilaterally decided he\u2019ll be spending his summer across the country and I was so excited because the band is coming right before he leaves and we wanted to see this band before Covid but the pandemic didn\u2019t make that possible. \n\nHe said no, because he has a final the next day. I said we didn\u2019t have to drink or anything, it would just be nice because all of our early dating memories are set to the soundtrack of this band. We\u2019ve been through a rough patch lately because two other men have confessed their love to me this year and you\u2019re jealous that you\u2019re not fun enough!! This might be fun! You already have a job lined up post graduation, you\u2019re graded on a curve and you just need to ride the curve, you\u2019re at an Ivy League school, you\u2019re okay blah blah blah. \n\nHe said \u201ci know you would go the night before a final but i am not you.\u201d\n\nSo, i thought \u201cOk, I\u2019m not him either. Why resent him for not being able to go when you can go yourself?\u201d \n\nSo, i bought myself a ticket. He got angry, started speaking to me through gritted teeth, hit his laptop and began referring to me by my full name (which he never does). \n\nAITA for buying this concert ticket when my bf made the choice for himself that he can\u2019t go.\n\n\nEdit: he came to the room after and said \u201cbuy me a ticket I\u2019ll Venmo you.\u201d No please, no thank you, no \u201cI\u2019m sorry i got upset\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m excited to do this with you.\u201d In my anger, i responded with \u201ci asked you when i was buying my ticket.

He sounds jealous and petty, ignore him and have a great time!", "NTA. You guys aren't very compatible, and it's clear that his solution to that is \"We will do what I want\". He has no issue making plans for himself that might impact you (i.e. spending the whole summer away), but if you so much as dare to spend a couple hours in a concert without him, he gets angry and starts punishing you with mistreatment. \n\nGo to the concert alone. You know the only reason he now wants to go is to ruin it for you. \n\nThis guy has more than one red flag and you should reconsider this relationship dynamic.", ">\u201ci asked you when i was buying my ticket. If you want one get it yourself, I\u2019m not your secretary.\u201d\n\nHell yeah OP. Good for you! You're NTA one bit.\n\nI think it's great that you still decided to go regardless of him not wanting to. It's interesting how he expects you not to do something simply because he doesn't want to do it himself. You showed a lot of self-respect and independence in your decisions and words here. Kudos!", "NTA. I was sympathetic towards him up until you bought yourself a ticket and he got angry. That\u2019s not acceptable at all.", "NTA. He can\u2019t control your money or your choices. Tbh do you imagine being with long term??? Because it sounds like he does resent you at the end", "NTA. \nWhat do you see in this guy besides good sex? Seriously. You guys don\u2019t seem compatible. You\u2019ve been fighting over this issue for years. And you can\u2019t make somebody be more outgoing. They are who they are. So, having that talk about \u201cneeding more from him\u201d was not only a waste of time, it was misguided.  He is who he is (and there is nothing wrong with that). Plus, he sounds like a jerk anyway. Time to call it a day. Maybe you\u2019ll meet someone at the concert lol.", "NTA. Ignore Him, he's the one being an AH", "NTA for either actions.  You are not his secretary!  I hope you have a great time at the concert!", "NTA. So he can unilaterally spend the whole summer away but you can't unilaterally go to a concert? He's being very unfair.", "NTA. I was almost N A H until you said how nasty he\u2019s being now that you bought the ticket. He just sounds grumpy in general. Like I wouldn\u2019t go to a concert the night before a final either, but I wouldn\u2019t get mad at my partner for going especially after they invited me and I said no.", "NTA. But it sounds like this behavior isn't changing anytime soon if you keep having arguments about it. I don't like going out much either, but I do it because my wife likes it; you may want to remind him that he's not allowed to unilaterally decide what you both do.", "NTA. He seems to be a bit childish.", "NTA. Go to the concert, don't think about him. Obviously he doesn't have to go with a final the next day (I certainly wouldn't) but you are free to enjoy yourself and he shouldn't say anything but \"Have fun.\"", "NTA. I was also a bit like this until my wife got me out of my shell, leading to me realising how important it is to do stuff together. It didn't cause us friction, but me planning things and taking her out unexpectedly is definitely something she really loves, and I'm also enjoying it now.", "NTA. It\u2019s unfair of your boyfriend to guilt-trip you, and he can\u2019t expect you to skip the concert\u2014or other activities\u2014just because he can\u2019t or won\u2019t go. This issue also sounds like a pattern, indicating you two have deeper relationship problems to address.\n\nThis summer will be an opportunity to reflect on your relationship and consider whether it\u2019s the right fit moving forward. \n\nBest of luck.", "Gonna go to NTA. Was close to ESH due to you pressuring him but you decided that you would go on your own. Just because he doesn't want to go doesn't mean he gets to **dictate** whether you should go. Also, hitting his laptop? What a child.", "NTA\n\nSounds like a toxic relationship.", "NTA.  I can understand his not wanting to go the night before a final.  Especially if it is a hard/important one.  But his getting so upset because you are going seems like a red flag in this relationship.   Plus, it sounds like there are some real compatibility issues here.  I think you need to spend some time reflecting on whether this is the person you want to spend  your life with.  (And I am not one of those people always telling people to ditch their SO here...)", "Tbh it sounds like you\u2019re not compatible. \n\nYou can love someone with your whole entire heart and them still not be the right one for you . \n\nIf you like to get out and about and the person you\u2019re with isn\u2019t the same and isn\u2019t willing to make the effort to meet you somewhere in the middle at least .. then ultimately you\u2019re not going to be happy with them and the feeling of resentment grows \n\nNTA btw", "NTA. If he doesn't want to go, that's fine, but he can't expect you to stay home. And this happens a lot. You guys don't sound compatible. He needs to compromise if the relationship is going to work.", "NTA\n\nFind a person who wants to actually do things with you.\n\nAlso, his display of anger is a huge red flag. Inanimate objects won't be the target of his rage for long.", "NTA Go to the gig without him. Do all the things you want to do. I missed out on so much because of my ex and I'm still mad at myself for allowing it", "He sounds like he thinks he is your parent. Your full name? That hit me as off. NTA", "NTA. Just because he isn\u2019t comfortable doing something, doesnt mean you have to miss out. Does he expect you to sit at home and twiddle your thumbs while he\u2019s gone across the country, lest you do something he might\u2019ve wanted to participate in? Foh with that nonsense.\n\nAlso that line about not being his secretary was perfect. You\u2019re my hero, go live your dreams. (But maybe not with the BF because i\u2019m sorry to judge by a little excerpt in y\u2019all lives but oof there are some real red lookin flags out here)", "INFO: By \u201che has a final\u201d, do you mean exams?", "NTA.  It's healthy for couples to have time apart.  I go to cons in town while my spouse hangs out at home", ">he turns me down for things often or he\u2019s not very enthused about doing these things with me.\n\n>It\u2019s caused a lot of friction over the years\n\n>My bf unilaterally decided he\u2019ll be spending his summer across the country\n\n>He got angry, started speaking to me through gritted teeth, hit his laptop and began referring to me by my full name (which he never does). \n\n>he came to the room after and said \u201cbuy me a ticket I\u2019ll Venmo you.\u201d No please, no thank you, no \u201cI\u2019m sorry i got upset\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m excited to do this with you.\u201d\n\nLovely man you've got...\n\nNTA", "Nta sounds like there's a conflict of interests in this relationship it might be time to say goodbye", ">He got angry, started speaking to me through gritted teeth, **hit his laptop**\n\nNTA and wow this behavior is very concerning.", "NTA.  He has a final so you are doing him a favor by clearing out and giving him a few hours of uninterrupted quiet to study.", "\\*\\*NTA - This was my mistake. I read it as she bought *him* a ticket. OMG you should definitely go! I do think my comment on this relationship struggling is still there though...he overreacted for sure.\n\n~~YTA, softly. He said no. You railroaded him. You thought his reasons weren't valid.~~\n\nYou guys aren't compatible. He may already be thinking your relationship will end at graduation, and you aren't clued into this discussion at all.", "YTA. Not for the ticket but for not getting that going to a concert on a night before a final is probably not a good thing. It sounds as if when he turns you down it is because he has things to do like school work. He got into an Ivy League school and a good job because he made school work and responsibilities a priority.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
