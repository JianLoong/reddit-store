Also, if she works at a top-tier law firm, those are likely her normal rates.  They're high, but that's pretty normal for big firm prices.  My guess is that sister did not have the ability to give him a discount or work for free if she works for big law.

I have learned deeply personal and embarrassing things about my clients, which I've needed to know so that I can effectively represent them. I think it would be harder for someone to do that knowing that they were looking at another 40 or so years of sitting across from me at Thanksgiving, for example.

Here\u2019s my perspective: My dad was a lawyer, and he worked in the same building for a decade. Downstairs, it was him and his partner prosecuting tobacco companies. Upstairs was a criminal defense firm. They shared a conference room and were generally on great terms. Fast forward many years, and I needed a criminal defense attorney. I reached out to my dad for help, knowing that was not his area but hoping he could connect me with the right person. He connected me with that firm and I was granted a \u201cfriend of the firm\u201d flat fee that ended up saving me a significant amount of money. The attorney I was working with charged every single little thing, even text messages, to his firm but I didn\u2019t have to pay.

I know people that leave out details when they are too focused on wanting to justify why they deserve a certain fee or want to seem big. \n\nSo yea, whilst there could be contract constraints OP wouldn\u2019t know about that unless she told him.

My firm doesn\u2019t care and has never cared about this kind of thing, even when I was a young newbie associate, as long as I was still getting all of my other work done. I helped my parents with a landlord-tenant matter in my first year or two, where I was out of the office for half a day for a hearing plus prep time, and my boss considered it good training, especially since we do some LT work. \n\nThere are plenty of things that annoy me about my boss but he\u2019s never been a hard ass about doing work for family or close friends for free/cheap, within reason. He sees it as one of the perks of being an attorney - being able to help family out now and again.

Would you be upset with her if she was a doctor and refused to operate or a hairstylist who did not want to cut your hair? Exactly how are you entitled to anything from her for free? Entitled is the correct word for you, since you decided that you would not speak to her for not representing you for free. do what the hell everybody else does and pay for the services that you get. Do you have any idea how many times she has probably been asked for free advice or representation? She has probably decided that her answer is no and when entitled people persist, she gives them a number that is too high just to stop them. It is never a good idea to mix business with pleasure. She is your sister, not your lawyer however, you chose to treat her as a complete stranger because she did not want to accommodate your request. She has every right to say no.", "You are the asshole, 1000%. Her request that you pay for her for legal work was reasonable and not the least bit unusual. A sybling discount might be one thing, but you want her to provide thousands of dollars in free profesional services? GTFO. Then you stop talking to her and make a scene at your own wedding? You are a huge asshole and owe your sister multiple apologies.", ">She took me aside to accuse me of \"embarrassing\" her\n\nI she can justify her position, why should she be concerned about you simply telling the truth?", "You are TA for having expected her to take your case for free, though I think charging one's family for advice might be a bit much, but admittedly I am not a lawyer\n\nHowever, NTA for telling the truth when asked about the case and why she isn't your lawyer", "NTA.\n\nDo stupid things, win stupid prizes. What did she think? That you would be quiet about her actions for the rest of your life? Wtf.", "Truth is best offense and best defense", "NTA. Seems fair to me. People wondered why sis isn't your lawyer. You told them. Sis embarrassed herself.", "NTA from the details provided - If she didn't want to work with you due to a conflict of interest concern, or even if she was just too busy, then she should have just told you outright. Sending out an inflated quote to scare you off is kind of assholish behaviour. That's just speculation though, and excluding those two priors though, I do not think it's unreasonable to help family members out when they're in need, it's the nice thing to do in a nice well-working family. However, again, I do not know the details of your case or your sister's circumstances, so It's hard to say.\n\nAs for you mentioning how she wanted to charge you money and such, you're not the asshole for that. Since you were just telling the truth about something you were asked. You didn't purposefully embellish details, nor did you bring it up unprompted to get back at her. If your sister found you sharing the truth embarrassing, then it suggests that even she herself feels her conduct was unbecoming, perhaps suggesting that she could have reasonably helped you out. \n\nSo yeah, I do not think you were an asshole. Not for asking for help (again, not unreasonable to ask family for help although they aren't always an asshole for declining), or for telling the truth when asked later. If she didn't like you mentioning it, then she should have said something to you that should could stand behind.", "1000% you YTA. Every friend. Every family member and every friend of every friend and family member want a discount from lawyers. \nThis is our job. We are not a Best Buy. We earned the right through years and years of study and experience to charge our rate and we HATE representing people we know. \n\nHere is why: we care about you. If I\u2019m taking on my brother\u2019s case it will be all I think about and all I work on meaning, I don\u2019t work on anything else. So, yes, we have to make up that income because why should we get evicted for helping you with your mistake?\n\nLook at it from her perspective and from a professional perspective. I tried helping family and I hear about their cases at every single family gathering when I only want to be a sibling/cousin/nephew\u2026just let me breathe. \n\nYou get what you pay for. Good luck, but yeah man\u2026YTA\n\nEdit: to add, I wish she had leaned into the cost even more and said \u201cyup\u2026I asked that much and next time I\u2019ll ask for double from him and everyone here. So\u2026either don\u2019t do a damn felony or know if you want me, this is the cost.\u201d", "Lawyer here. My instinct is YTA, but feel like there\u2019s a LOT of context missing from this story. I don\u2019t know a single lawyer who would just up and say \u201cI\u2019ll give you my legal opinion but you have to pay me 10,000 dollars first.\u201d And in criminal defense, 60k is a murder rate. A relatively more affordable murder rate, sure, but if that\u2019s the quote, I\u2019m surmising that we\u2019re not talking about petty theft, here. And something tells me this isn\u2019t your first rodeo, but I won\u2019t assume too far. \n\nSo what I\u2019m getting is that you got in A LOT of trouble. It sounds like you and your sister may not be on the best of terms to begin with. And now you feel entitled to her labor - what she\u2019s trained for several years to do and what she does on a daily basis to feed her family or whatever - for free. And with the size of the trouble, that could mean a TON of free labor. \n\nI will almost always answer questions and help friends and family who are going through something. But yes, I can absolutely imagine a circumstance under which I\u2019d say \u201cenough is enough\u201d and refuse to work without compensation. Sure.", "YTA for holding a grudge against her. Time is money. Someone deserves to be properly paid for their time and work. Doesn't matter if you are a mechanic, general contractor, painter, carpenter, electrician, or lawyer. You think you deserve free or heavily discounted work just because you are family. Get over your fucking self. On top of that if she is working for a top law firm she probably can't be giving family discounts.", "YTA - your sister has a degree and qualifications and you want her to do work for her you for free just because your blood?", "YTA. If she's very, VERY good, and is actually worth that much money, she'd be actively losing a lot of money by giving you the family discount.  It's not like a mechanic who can swing by and do your brakes on Saturday morning. If she's working your case for free or close to it, she's not billing other clients. \n\nOR. \n\nShe didn't want to do it and gave you a giant price tag to get you to drop it. That'd be kind of a weird way of going about it, but i could see that happening. \n\nBut what I don't buy is you \"innocently\" letting slip what happened (with zero spin, I'm sure).  If you're the type of person to not invite a sibling to your wedding because of something like this, you're 100% the type of person to talk shit.", "I'm sad to say this, but YTA. My father had a framed picture in his office for years that said *\"a lawyer's  time and advice is his stock in trade.\"* He also taught me that any attorney who gives advice for free probably doesn't have any opinion or advice worth taking. If your sister works in a law firm for anyone other than herself, she's probably required by her firm to keep a close accounting of her time, and may even be barred from assisting you for free by her employment contract, malpractice insurer or bar association. In any case, it might adversely affect her  professionally, and she has every right to expect to be compensated fairly. You'd certainly blame her if she represented you for free and lost the case because she was unable to dedicate enough time and resources to it, such as for paying private investigators, paralegals, expert witnesses and other associated costs. You certainly didn't need to say as much as you did about the situation at your wedding, if the situation were reversed and you were a guest at her wedding, you'd feel horrible and like you'd been targeted deliberately, as payback for not representing her for free. You should both be mad at your friend for even mentioning the case in the first place, he should have minded his own business and saved that topic for a more appropriate time.", "Fuck that noise! \n\nEvery other day there is some post about someone providing some service and entitled friends or family demanding that service for free (Wedding dresses is a pretty popular one).\n\nYet here OP is doing exactly that; being an entitled ass demanding his sister to work for free. And here people are defending his bs.\n\nInstead of seeing those numbers ass the \"hige amount of money the many sis is charging poor OP\".\nLet's see them for what they really are: The huge amount of money in time and effort OP is demanding his sis to simply gift him.\n\nAs for the wedding; instead of embarrassed. Couldn't sis be simply annoyed some rando started harrasing her about her entitled brothers crap from a while back?\n\nOP is absolutely YTA. And an entitled, whiny one at that.", "If that\u2019s what she gets then so be it.  Giving her brother a discount would mean one fewer client paying full price.", "She works for a law firm though not her own practice. She may not get to set the prices or gave the authority to offer discounts.", "If a family member was in a tough situation and I had the skills to help them, then yes I would charge the minimum I could.\n\nHouse painting isn\u2019t the same because it\u2019s a want and not a need. Unless it\u2019s a frivolous case, lawyers generally fall under needs while house painting is a want. But if a family member had their house burn down and needed a painter I\u2019d probably volunteer.", ">If you were a painter by trade, would you agree to paint your entire sisters house for free?\n\nNope. But I would give them a free consultation", "Lol, it wouldn't even be permitted by the rules of professional conduct in my jurisdiction. Honestly, I'm kind of surprised to see that it (apparently) would be in the jurisdictions of most of the lawyers replying.", "Yeah, a defense case pro bono is different than like a single day of small claims court. She would be taking time and effort that could go on weeks to months and he'd take up the spot a paying client would. That's money out of her pocket, and if she was a little wary about the case he has vs a client who has a strong case, I think it IS a little entitled to take her services from someone who might really need her help. \n\nI've seen family members of friends refuse and direct them to other attorneys/lawyers for conflict of interest and I've seen family represent family who they believed were being unjustly accused of something or straight up KNEW they weren't guilty, but if you think your family member is guilty it really does reflect on you when you represent them. I'm kind of surprised at the way this is being voted tbh", "Yeah idk about this lol. Even TOP lawyers at prestigious firms bill like 750-1000usd an hour. 10,000 for a sit down ?", "I am just speculating but my guess is that 10k is a retention fee.", "The original posting didn't say anything about 10k - they said a \"couple of thousands \"", "> I would be upset if I didn\u2019t give my sibling a discount and then got the cold shoulder for a presumably long period of time because of it.\n\nI would be upset with my family if I asked them a quick question about something pertaining to their line of work and they tried to charge me a massive amount of money for a quick conversation.  Not giving him a deal on being his actual lawyer is more reasonable, but blowing off the conversation entirely with an immediate family member is unreasonable, at least for most families, I think.", "This isn't what the verdict is about though... If she didn't have time or a conflict of interest, she should have actually said that. Also, he first just asked for advice and just that. She could have offered some simple advice and then pointed him in the right direction for proper legal representation if that were really her concern. \n\nBesides, this is about her calling him an asshole for revealing the fact that she wanted to charge him obscene amounts for legal advice. He didn't embellish details, didn't bring it up until someone else asked, or beat it to death. He simply spoke the truth, and he can't be an asshole for that as far as I'm concerned. Also, I debate whether simply asking a family member for assistance is an asshole move anyway, a good family should help each other out when they can. Although, that doesn't necessarily mean that she would be an asshole for declining, it depends on her reasons, but if she gave an outlandishly high quote with the intention of making him go away, even if it were underlined with other, more valid reasons, then that would be asshole behaviour. Because she should have just told him those other, more valid reasons. But it's impossible to say, and I'm just speculating at these other, better reasons existing.\n\nSo idk if she's an asshole or not for not helping him. Idk the details of the case, her rates, how much work she has at the moment, or her firm's policies. Regardless of that though, she should have told her brother something she could stand behind, rather than get angry and embarrassed later on just from him telling other people what she told him. So even if you think she isn't an asshole, I find it hard to see how he is an asshole either.", "Or the fact that as soon as you are in law, suddenly all your deadbeat relatives want help for free for things they got themselves into. I would never for any of my family, they need to find someone else", "Lol- you left out the part where if you *don't* help them with the case, you get that look from everyone who hears about it that implies that either it must've been too difficult for you or you were being selfish.  It's like 'nope! I just have years of experience explaining to people how they have to choose between two shitty options, and there's a reason that there's an ancient expression \"don't shoot the messenger!\"'", "I suppose confidentiality stuff would limit your ability to defend yourself as well? Not just the privilege thing, but also being bad form to badmouth a client.", "He left out a lot of the parts of the conversation and only told us what bits he wanted to. We don't know the case or the details of it going into it. How bad it looked for him, if she thought he was guilty or not.  Is this his first case? Did he have a history of doing similar dumb shit described in the case while growing up? We got the sentences that said \"only if you pay me a lot\" and none of her reasoning. She sounded dismissive because OP framed it that way.", "I recommend no family discount. Less resentment. When people give steep discount, it means properly paid work is prioritized anyway", "Certain lines of work beget harassment from unaware family members who mean well, but just don\u2019t know how often the individual they\u2019re asking gets pestered on a daily basis for free work. \n\nWhile I agree with you and would never treat my family members that way, we don\u2019t know OP, their sister, or their family. Sister probably set a necessary boundary. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this wasn\u2019t the first time she had to enforce it.", "There's an entire sub genre of those people in this sub", "Yeah - I love that look.  Yes, this divorce between 2 middle class people with 3 kids, standard credit card debt, and a suburban split-level with moderate equity is simply beyond me.  I have just been sitting at my desk drooling for the past 20 years...  LOL", "Absolutely!  You can't say ANYTHING.  You just have to sit there like a big dummy and smile when you really want to scream \"well, brother dear, if you had not purchased a jet ski a week after saying there was not enough money for her to go visit her 85 year old mother and then made a pass at the neighbor...\"  But you have to sit there with your mouth shut like a big dummy.", "I mean, it comes down to how he is telling other people, his tone and words form their first opinion. \"It wasn't her specialty and her firm didn't allow discounts to family\" is just as true as \"She wanted to charge me an outrageous rate.\"\n\nAt lot of banks and lawyers are expected to do pro bono work that benefits the community. Most also have rules preventing employees from benefitting. She may not have had a free option, or any other range of valid reasons. \n\nHis representation of the facts could easily be causing bias.  Likely he is frustrated at not getting the free lawyer and is feeling betrayed due to his expectations. I think it's easy to see how he could be being honest, but also creating a bias she has to defend against.", "As an attorney in general practice, I am self-employed and do work for family (depending on the work) or friends free or discounted but if I worked for someone else, I would not be able to do that. Also there is some work, criminal defense being one, that I would not take on for family at any cost. Anything that goes wrong is your fault and you frequently don't get paid because you didn't win the case for them.  it's not a good idea to represent friends or family in something that is as fraught as a criminal charge. OP said she was a defense attorney.  Free advice is only as good as what you pay for it. If OP was a defendant whether civil or criminal, it would be unprofessional and downright stupid to give a legal opinion without knowing all about the case. That could take anywhere from an hour to days depending on what the case is.\n\nI can relate one instance that might explain the sister's whole side of it. A friend asked me as a favor to talk to one of her cosmetics customers: she just needed an attorney to look over some papers from family court to and see if she was reading it correctly. I did.  It was a favor because I don't do family law for the reason everyone wants to win, no one wins because the court is going to make sure that the decision is fair, and everyone's unhappy. Then it's the attorney's fault when they don't get all they wanted.\n\nAnyway: friend's customer convinced me to just to go to the hearing with her for moral support. Don't know the person from Adam but I'm a soft touch once they get in the door and it was very cut and dried. She didn't show up for the hearing. I was worried that she might have either forgotten or been in an accident, Once you show up as attorney it's kind of your job to make sure your client's there too. So  I called her work, not identifying myself, just asked for her. The person who answered the phone recognized my voice (damn, realized too late my ex-sil was her supervisor) and said \"she's supposed to be in court with you.\"\n\nSix ugly hearings later, I still hadn't been paid except for the steeply discounted consult fee as it was only supposed to be to review a document. She comes out much on the short end, mostly because she blew her best chance by not showing up for court the first time. Or the second time. Then at a big community function, I hear her behind me talking to a large group of people--did I mention this is a small town--about how I screwed her out of all this money in her child support hearings and casting aspersions on my character and ability to practice law. I turned around and glared at her but didn't say anything. My brother was part of the group. He never said a word in my defense. When I asked him later why he hadn't say something  like \"hey that's my sister and she's standing right in front of you\"--client confidentiality he didn't know anything about my representing her--he said he didn't hear the remarks he was watching the parade.\n\nSo the one favor I did someone who had been vouched for by a good friend blew up in my face, harmed my reputation in the community and caused a row in my family.  Long way of saying my bet is OP is leaving some things out.\n\nEdited for a couple of left out words.", "I think if she\u2019d refused the case, we\u2019d be reading a post about how she didn\u2019t believe he was innocent, didn\u2019t think she would win, etc.", "Telling someone the truth when specifically asked about it isn't holding a grudge.", "Exactly this. I too can work for friends and family for free as a partner at a smaller firm. I couldn\u2019t when I was an associate in big law. And you pointed out why attorneys have to be very careful when doing this sort of thing. Most commentators don\u2019t understand our ethics or how we can\u2019t always narrowly define the scope of our work.", "She might have been embarrassed if he told a handful of people a version of the story that was different from reality. He's charged for harassment, then gets a lingering grudge against a family member to a point where he's ready to throw them under the bus at his wedding? I feel like there was a good reason to not represent him.", "If it's not the truth, and he's giving that story to everyone within earshot, I think it would be bothersome. If he's willing to offer up information (that isn't exactly accurate) on his wedding day instead of giving a short summary about the end result of his harassment charges, how many times has she come up in casual conversation? There are a lot of ways OP has presented himself as a client that would have been difficult for her to work with that would tie up services for someone who may have been in need of what she has to offer.", "Yeah that one really depends on who the advice is for lol", "It's not just lawyers. \"Everyone\" expects their relatives who are photographers to shoot their weddings for free. People who work in IT are expected to be on-call free computer support for the whole family. Doctors tend to get regaled with lists of symptoms at the dinner table.", "Yes, but when those people ask if they\u2019re the AHs for not providing free work, this entire sub is like \u201cof course not - you should be paid for your work.\u201d Here, the entire sub is outraged the sister didn\u2019t take her brother\u2019s case for free."]}
