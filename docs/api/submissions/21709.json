If you're not prepared (emotionally, financially, etc) then you'd be doing everyone a disservice taking her in.  This is a situation where you'd both need to agree on her moving in for that to happen.  \n\nThere's nothing stopping your fianc\u00e9 from going to visit her or treating her to dinner or something.  If he wants to help, he can start there.  Or volunteer to help drive her to any activities/appointments she might have.  It might help him realize there's a lot more to having a teenager move in with you than just having someone hang out in your home.  \n\nI hope she can get into some therapy, it sounds like she's had a lot of big changes recently.", "Nta. A child 6 years younger than you would be chaos. Now add in a child who has mental health issues who has been through hell and back (otherwise CPS wouldn\u2019t have stepped in). You are also looking at a child who will have abandonment issues and minimal to no rules because\u2026mom was neglectful and may have been unable to care at certain times due to drugs or alcohol. It\u2019s not crazy to not want this situation in your home. But I commend your fianc\u00e9 for wanting to step in.", "NTA it sounds like your fiance has not thought this through. You are 100% entitled to express that you do not want to be an overnight parent and if the fiance persists with this idea then the relationship may have to accomodate his wish by splitting in two.", "I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d have the emotional resources to deal with a problem teenager only 6 years younger than you.

It would be different if she didn\u2019t have a safe place to live.  If the other sister really is happy to have her, then it\u2019s about the teenager not liking rules and boundaries-which are totally necessary when raising a teenager.  The niece thinks her uncle is going to be an easier mark.  \n\nBut you are only 20. And one who doesn\u2019t want kids. Your fianc\u00e9 does not get to unilaterally decide you\u2019re suddenly going to raise one. Particularly one already into the rebellious years. If she\u2019s having trouble with authority now, it\u2019s not going to improve living with an uncle only 9 years older.  And no, he has no clue how much it\u2019s going to cost.  \n\nThis is a situation that requires 2 yes votes.  I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as niece moving from aunt to uncle.

All the trauma with her mom ( you know there is some if her mom lost custody) will make her unlikely to be a non-rebellious teenager. This should be a hill to die on and you should move out if he doesn't listen.", "Very bad idea.

Key word ask though, he cant just make the decision for you both.", "NAH. You're entitled to your feelings. I understand how he feels, and have friends that understand how he feels. But how you feel is important too. This is about raising a child. An expensive, teenage girl at that. Teenage girls aren't fun and easy all the time. \n\nI think this is much more than a Reddit post can advise you on. This is a human being, your opinion counts as much as his.  Remember that.", "NAH\n\nTough situation for all concerned. I can't fault you for not wanting to take on this responsibility at your young age, or at all. But I also can't fault your partner for wanting to do the right thing by his niece, who says she's unhappy.\n\nThere are no easy solutions here unfortunately. If you stick to your guns, your partner and the family may resent you for it. If you back down, you will likely resent your partner and this will definitely put a lot of strain on your relationship. \n\nI think couple/ family therapy is the way to go here so you can all discuss it with someone who can keep it on track and help you find some sort of solution.", "Yes, take a deep look at why you dont want another female in the house...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
