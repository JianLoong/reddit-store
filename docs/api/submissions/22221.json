I\u2019m not really working for him so much as I\u2019m helping with his business while being paid under the table.\n\nEarlier during the summer, I applied for some jobs, and one job offer was quite interesting and a great opportunity for good money while i didn\u2019t have classes. The only issue was that I needed proof that i was going to college next fall, and I didn\u2019t yet have the money to pay for my semester\u2026 so my dad told me to use his credit card to pay for it. I told him i didnt really want to be endebted to someone else but he insisted and so i let him, and i got my proof to apply to that job (sadly i did not get it in the end). \n\nSo, now Its a few weeks later and i went to help my dad a few times since then, and today I messaged him asking if i could get the money i should\u2019ve made with my work hours. He responded with \"sure, you started at -35 hours, now you\u2019re at -24\". \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t clear enoughx he didn\u2019t pay me for my work, and instead took money off of my debt that he insisted on giving me, without telling me in advance that he would do this. I was under the assumption that I\u2019d work normally and get a pay, and then i could pay him back when my scholarship money came in during my semester.\n\nI was looking forward to getting a watch (which is arguably not the greatest business decision, i know, but if i got paid i could\u2019ve afforded it easily) and now, without warning, i have to stick to buying nothing so i can just afford my internet and phone bills\u2026\n\nI didn\u2019t respond to his message, but I also don\u2019t think i\u2019m going to go back to help him, since i see essentially 0 purpose to doing it at this point. Im 24 hours behind on pays, and the watch i wanted has its pre-order closed in 2 days, so i can\u2019t get it.\n\nThat\u2019s essentially the story\u2026 would I be the asshole for ignoring his last message and not helping him any further because of this?", "created_utc": 1689328859, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zc8zz/wibta_if_i_stopped_working_for_my_dad_after_he/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

ESH. You should have been an adult and worked out the terms of the agreement before taking the money.", "ESH - neither of you were clear on the terms of repayment. \n\n\n\n\nBut you can't buy a watch, so you're going to burn bridges with your dad? Grow up. That's just life, and you can literally fix this with 1 week of working. Work, repay the debt you owe and be more clear next time", "I think it would make sense to work the last 24 hours for your dad (that's 3 days, so doable) but then stop.\n\nIt would mean you are no longer in his debt, but I too would be irritated that he didn't tell you first that he is going to immediately substract the hours you worked from your debt. I would have assumed I would pay later as well and the clarification on when payment is expected would have been much more considerate of you.\n\nI think ignoring it could potentially damage your relationship with your dad, whether that is a risk you willing to take, is up to you.", "NTA but he sounds like he\u2019ll hang it over your head nonstop until it\u2019s paid. For your own peace and happiness it\u2019s probably best to get through 24hrs of work, doesn\u2019t mean you need to give it 100%. Then next time he wants anything I\u2019d be petty and say my hourly rate is X, cash only, wage payment deadline is X and refuse to lift a finger otherwise.", "ESH\n\nBefore taking any job the responsibility is on YOU to confirm duties, hours and wages. Leaving your dad in the lurch because you cannot buy a shiny thing is also kinda shitty. However, expecting someone to work for free and not telling her is also an AH move.", "YTA to yourself here. \n\nAs far as i understand your scholarship money only comes when the semester already started, so you had to earn the money for tuition anyway during summer or get a loan from your dad, right? Or can you pay your tuition later?\n\nBut anyway, it doesn't really matter, its not like you lose money working for him - it allows you to keep the money you get from the scholarship later. If you stop working for him now, you can't keep the scholarship money in full due to having to pay back your dad. And i'm pretty sure you will be glad you can keep the scholarship money later. \n\nThe smartest you can do now is to work off the debt and look for a easy job like at a fastfood chain or in retail to earn some extra money. The watch you wanted to buy - well, believe me, there gonna be more watches you can spend your money on ;) And it doesn't seem you already have a lot of money laying around, its not a good idea to spend all the money you earn right away.", "YTA just work the damn 24 hours off", "Info-What do you have lined up to pay him back if you don't help him anymore? How much did he spend?", "YTA. He helped you out, and 24 hours isn't much to work.", "Y TA. How are you going to pay rent if you don't help your dad? He could decide to kick you out if you don't work for him.  You both need better communication skills to fully discuss a plan before moving forward based on assumptions.", "INFO: how much was the cost of putting it on his credit card? Min wage in my state is $10.10 so starting at 35 hours would be $353.50.  Yes your Dad should have told you up front he'd put the pay against your debt but you also need to pay him back.  \n\nYou should be using scholarship and loan money for living expenses and school.", "NTA. But it does sound like it is something he will bag you about. So I'd pay him back ASAP. That should have been a Convo both of you had regarding how to pay back and how fast. Personally I rather be broke then be indebted to someone, some ppl won't let it go even after it's paid back.", "your dad sounds nasty OP", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your dad helped you out and now you are mad at him because you (pout) can't buy a watch. You have a phone? You don't NEED a watch! I feel sorry for your dad.

I\u2019m not understanding..Your scholarship covers the tuition your dad paid? Why didn\u2019t it already show up that you were attending next semester? I\u2019ve never heard of a student that attends college on scholarship not being registered for fall classes because their scholarship money hasn\u2019t hit yet. Plus you would have already had to register for your fall semester classes. Even if what you are saying is true about not being registered, your dad fronted you money so that you could have a better opportunity for a job, that opportunity didn\u2019t pay off, and now you want to let your dad\u2019s loan ride until August?  Why should your dad have to wait til august instead of you waiting til august?", "Yes you are a spoiled brat", "Just throwing it out there you\u2019re lucky you are able to work for your dad and even get paid. Alotta people stress over finding jobs. I know you\u2019re young as were we all but I wouldn\u2019t burn the bridge with your farther. I get it doesn\u2019t seem fair but it\u2019s pretty cool he let you throw your semester on his credit card. I think he\u2019s also trying to prepare you for life.
