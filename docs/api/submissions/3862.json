It doesn\u2019t sound like your sister did anything wrong other than call out the inappropriate behavior.  So, you took your wife\u2019s side which is the side of the abuser (BIL).\n\nYou deserve your family dropping you.  You picked your wife\u2019s family on a question of inappropriate behavior of your wife\u2019s family member.\n\nThis is on you for not doing a better job in handing the original situation.  If your BIL was inappropriate with your sister, you should have stopped it, you shouldn\u2019t tolerate inappropriate behavior towards women just because the abuser is related to you by marriage.  Your sister was concerned enough to say something, so some line was crossed with her.  You grew up with her, so you should know where her boundary lines are.\n\nYou don\u2019t stand by your wife no matter what, because sometimes your spouse is wrong.
