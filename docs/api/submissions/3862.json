You picked your wife\u2019s family on a question of inappropriate behavior of your wife\u2019s family member.\n\nThis is on you for not doing a better job in handing the original situation.  If your BIL was inappropriate with your sister, you should have stopped it, you shouldn\u2019t tolerate inappropriate behavior towards women just because the abuser is related to you by marriage.
