As someone pointed out earlier, you don't have any legal responsibility to your partner's kids, should something happen.  You also communicated to your partner about how you felt.  This is where I don't think your partner is listening to you and the fact that your partner is allowed to pass on the kids while you were out of town but expects you to watch them while he is gone...is an insight to how life will be if and when you fully commit to this person.\n\nJust cause the ex is about due, doesn't mean she can also expect you to keep the kids - what's her plan if you weren't around to begin with?", "NTA\n\nHang on, you are not even married to this dude? And he and his ex leave the kids with you? This is not passing the smell test. You need to grow a spine and not ASK, but INFORM both of them that you are no longer taking the kids when your partner is not in the home.\n\nUsually exes don't want partners who are not married to their prior partner to have much to do with 'their' kids. So it sounds like both parents suck and you need to put a stop to them BOTH taking advantage of you.\n\nThis is a weird situation and if I were in it, I would be getting out. Not my kids, not my problem. If they leave them with you after you say 'No', report them both to the police. That is parental abandonment. Yikes.", "NTA.   \n\n\nAnd you need to pack your bags and leave your partner. He's just using you as a caretaker for his children without paying you and get to sleep with you. Just no. Don't let him take advantage of you for your services further.", "NTA honestly some flags of hes cheating there I feel. But that's just me", "Dump his ass before the work trip don't be walked over", "Well explains his divorce. He clearly doesnt want the hard parts of parenting, or even the inconvinient ones. \n\nHard to tell, but are you even happy in the relationship, you sound more like your being taken advantage of than building a life. \n\nNTA only if you cave and or dont put a stop to this behavior", "NTA. The kids should never have to have overnights with the girlfriend. The two parents need to work it out. Poor kids. Bounced around.", "The ex absoloutly is obligated to take the kids, as the only other actual parent.", "Bad take, she shouldn't have to take care of kids that she doesn't know very well for a week and a half. Recipe for disaster.\n\nEDIT: she does know them very well, my bad. Point still stands, this man isn't taking care of his kids and is expecting her to be the sole caregiver.", "He himself refused to \"watch his own kids\". When OP went away on his week with the kids he had them stay with their mother, like OP wants to do, only he is the actual parent.", "Why are you doing childcare duties that your partner is too lazy to do for his own kids ? You need to see if you are getting anything from this relationship or if you are being used mainly as childcare. If you were not caring for the kid\u2019s primarily when it is his turn , then would he still be with you ?", "You are parenting them more than their own father! You need to leave.", "I didn\u2019t want to be crude but it sounds like OP is a bang-nanny.", "Nta. What a cheek why did he give his own kids away while you were away. \nYou know you need a new boyfriend right.", "NTA. You are obviously a good person with a kind heart. Find a partner that protects and cherishes that. Get rid of the man who takes advantage of it.", "NTA I can\u2019t tell you how many summers we spent with the stepmonster while the paternal unit had to work. Paternal unit always had trouble finding work when mom needed child support\u2026But when it was time for our two weeks-he miraculously found a job. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA", "No need for those \u201cmany many questions\u201d not her children, should not be her problem! Jfc!!", "NTA- Why did their dad give them back to their mom when you were gone?!  I mean really that speaks volumes to me .. what would these two do if you weren\u2019t in the picture ? Go with that.. you did not create these kids and are already over accommodating . Go on the stepparents sub. They will tell you you\u2019re being completely walked all over and to let their parents sort out this big stuff", "Those kids have two mothers and no father. NTA", "Excuse me but wtf. He can\u2019t even take care of his kids?? He\u2019s a loser and you are NTA.", "Is it a scheduling thing or can he just not be bothered? OP, do you work? This entire situation sounds like you are being taken advantage of.", "That\u2019s because you are.", "You know ur doing too much when you care more than the actual parent (S).", "If his ex was single you could move in with her; you\u2019re already co parents."]}
