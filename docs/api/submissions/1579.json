{"id": 1579, "submission_id": "yn527x", "title": "AITA for not telling my husband that our baby was kicking?", "selftext": "I (29F) have had a fear of pregnancy my entire life. My husband (27M) has always wanted a family. We compromised and decided to use a surrogate, but I ended up pregnant before we could put our plans in motion. My husband was very hesitant - his mother shared similar views to me on pregnancy and their relationship is very sour because of it. We both went to therapy, individually and together, had a lot of talks, and we decided to go through with it.\n\nI'm warming up to a lot of this, but one hard boundary for me is I don't want people touching my stomach. It's even hard at the doctor's office but I do it because it's for the good of our child. I've articulated this boundary to my husband and even though it was upsetting to him, he respects it, for my benefit.\n\nI've been feeling baby kick for about 3 weeks now, but I haven't told my husband about it. I'm just afraid that he would push the boundary or feel left out, so I've just been keeping it to myself. \n\nWe've rarely been able to go to appointments together, so Thursday was the first in several weeks we were able to attend together. My husband mentioned he was worried that I was so late in pregnancy without feeling any movement and the OB got very concerned, asking me if I \"felt the kicks dropping off.\" I told her no, everything was fine, and even though my husband didn't say anything, I could tell he put everything together.\n\nHe was silent for the rest of the appointment and the whole ride home. He asked why I lied to him and I told him just what I said here. He accused me of not trusting him to respect my boundaries and said he needed to stay at a friend's that night. He came home yesterday and apologized for leaving but said it was a very serious violation of his trust. He even told me \"If you can't be honest about this, how do I know you'll be honest when you're in labor? Or if something bad happens?\" That felt harsh to me. Those are real emergencies. This wasn't.\n\nHe says it is hard for him already to know he has been completely shut out of the bonding process - which I don't think is fair at all - and that being treated like this has upset him further. I felt that he was exaggerating. I talked it over with my mom and she agreed that I was harsh to him and should've at least let him feel once and told him when it was happening, so he could feel included. That's too much to me. I don't feel comfortable putting the boundary down at all and I feel like that gives him the opportunity to push it.\n\nWas I in the wrong? Am I being outrageous?\n\nAITA for not telling my husband when our baby was kicking?", "created_utc": 1667679695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn527x/aita_for_not_telling_my_husband_that_our_baby_was/", "score": 236, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The answer is never \"withhold information because you don't want to discuss it and don't trust your partner to be reasonable\" but you've set that precedent. \n\nReligion. Age kid gets cell phone. Does kid get birth control when they ask? Does kid have to get screen time? \n\nThere are a thousand places you could disagree and that, once you get  to agreement , you have to trust your partner. \n\nTrust him and, if you can't, get to a counselor.", "This is complicated. As much as I am all about \"my body, my choice,\" this falls in a VERY gray area. Your husband isn't your college buddy or even your mom he is the father of the baby. The child you share together just so happens to be growing inside of you.\nIf your only question is, are yta for not telling him, then yes, YTA\nIf you're looking for advice, help me understand so I can offer you the best advice. What do you think will happen if dad touches your belly to feel his child kick?  I don't think he should have left that  night. He could have stayed and slept on the couch. \nAs for this causing trust issues, I get it. many people, myself included, feel that lying by omission is still lying. He is justified in worrying about the bigger problems because you kept a very important milestone to yourself.\nAgain, it's a gray area, but your husband is has a right to know even if you don't want him to touch your baby belly, he still needs to be reassured that the baby was progressing appropriately.", "I'm sorry but obviously YTA. A simple 'I'm feeling kicking but I'm still really freaked out so please don't touch' would suffice.\n\nYou have issues about it but so does he. He's not a one night stand who has nothing to do with your pregnancy. He's your partner. It's also his baby.\n\nMen can seriously struggle to bond or accept the reality if they're not involved because they're not physically attached to their child.\n\nYes, your reasons are valid but in not taking full precautions you both are responsible for the life growing in you. He just wants to be part of it.\n\nI've had a child, lost several and honestly I get it. Your body feels alien at times, you're possibly insecure and freaking out. Please let your partner in.\n\nIt's not OK for strangers to touch your belly without permission but with permission, your partner needs the reassurance you get daily that your (joint) child is OK.", "I have to admit I\u2019m shocked to say YTA but this isn\u2019t about your boundary. You clearly don\u2019t trust your husband. You don\u2019t want him to touch your belly. Ok, that\u2019s not what most mother\u2019s say to the father when they have a healthy relationship but I understand you have some specific issues that make this time difficult. But you point blank said telling him the baby was moving would prompt him to violate your boundary in your mind. That means you didn\u2019t trust him. You can say it however you want but the bottom line is you didn\u2019t want him to know there was movement because you were afraid he\u2019d try to feel it himself. So his feelings are valid. \n\nThis is a hard time for you and I\u2019m sorry. But while you are pregnant, you will both be parents. I\u2019m sure you expect him to get up, to change diapers, give baths, pick up medications etc. During pregnancy there\u2019s a limited number of ways for the non pregnant parent to bond. Feeling the baby kick and roll is one of the biggest. Your boundary is denying him that. And that\u2019s your choice. But to expect a co parent to be your partner, to support you in pregnancy, to share the hardships of parenthood while limiting their ability to bond warrants acknowledgment of how hard that may be on them. Acknowledging that this is difficult for him doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not also hard on you. It\u2019s not a competition. But you are partners. We can\u2019t always do something to fix the situation or change how we feel but we owe it to our partners to at least acknowledge their emotions.", "**YTA**\n\nAnd I say that as someone who, despite desperately wanting children, also had an absolute genuine phobia of pregnancy and giving birth. Your behaviour here makes no sense at all, even in the context of a fear of pregnancy, and is really staggeringly cold towards your husband, considering that this is the man you are supposed to love and want to raise this child in partnership with. How do you expect to deal with the intense intimacy of raising another human being together, 24/7, when you are so strongly opposed to even sharing the experience of your pregnancy with him THROUGH SPOKEN COMMUNICATION?\n\nFrom everything you've told us (which is what we have to judge by), there is absolutely no indication that your husband has been anything but EXTRAORDINARILY respectful about your fear of pregnancy. He was all set to use a surrogate so that you could avoid it altogether, and when that didn't pan out, it seems he has been nothing but thoughtful throughout your pregnancy and given you all the space you have required. You haven't indicated that he has even ONCE crossed a boundary. And yet you are so thoroughly mistrustful of him that you wouldn't even communicate an INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT MILESTONE in the pregnancy - a significant indication of your unborn child's health, growth, and vital progress.  You had no reason for this other than \"he might (against all evidence) want to touch me\".\n\n...and that's the part I really don't get. I get you not wanting strangers having their hands all over you. Or extended family and friends. I even get the fear of doctors. And I even get not wanting to be manhandled CONSTANTLY by your husband - getting touched out is totally a thing. But for people who fear being pregnant, in my experience, having the baby move inside them is usually what is triggering. The odd reminders of pregnancy. Whatever trauma you have that makes you NOT WANT YOUR OWN PARTNER TO TOUCH YOU AT ALL . . . as others have noted, clearly you got pregnant, so that has not always been the case. And there's no explicable reason why your own partner touching you would trigger you with regards to the pregnancy . . . in theory, he has been touching you for years. So what gives? \n\nNo matter what, though, YTA. You don't have to want to be touched - although you CLEARLY need serious therapy - but you cannot parent or be a partner if you refuse to communicate.", "YTA. the only way a partner gets to experience pregnancy is through information we give them, and \"I felt the baby move\" is pretty much the biggest bit of early pregnancy info they can get. So you didn't trust him, cut him off from learning that the baby was moving, and he's hurt. Poor guy. I'd be hurt, too.", "INFO: I (37f) am child-free by choice. I spent a LOT of time and money ensuring I *never* got pregnant and *never* will.  How did you not? I understand the fear of pregnancy, but what I don't understand is you not making 100% certain that you wouldn't. Pills? IUD? Depo? Bi-salp? \n\n\nI just don't understand how this happened when you absolutely *never* wanted to be pregnant?", "Yes YTA a bit. You're being closed off is pushing him away. If touching your belly is a problem for you, fine, that's a clear boundry. But using that to expand his non-involvment. he can't touch plus you won't talk is pushing him away (whether you intend it or not).", "YTA- if you can\u2019t have a simple conversation with your Husband, then why are you even married or having a kid?\n\nTell him \u201cthe baby has started kicking but as you\u2019re aware I am scared of the pregnancy so I don\u2019t want you to touch my belly\u201d \nIf you\u2019re worried he won\u2019t respect your boundaries then you once again you shouldn\u2019t be married or having a kid. \n\nWhen you\u2019re married you should be able to bring up any concerns or worries you have and discuss boundaries. Why are you even married if you can\u2019t even have a discussion? It seems so odd to me.", "I was the complete opposite so it's hard for me to understand, but I'm going to share my story in case it helps.\nI had all the feelings of kicking and movement and I've seen all the movies where the dad talks to the bump and reads stories to the bump and rubs the belly. I wanted that movie experience so much. My husband wasn't interested at all. He didn't touch the bump once, he said he would talk to the baby when it was born. That was hard for me. So I'm just putting the other side Across. Maybe he feels like i felt", "YTA. Full stop.\n\nYou said that\u2019s he\u2019s respected your boundaries so far, and you have no way of knowing he would push those boundaries unless you have left other information out. \n\nI\u2019m currently 8 months along, so I get the not wanting to be touched, but my husband is the exception. My husbands way of being included and bonding is when he gets to feel the kicks and checks in with how I\u2019m feeling. \n\nAs you\u2019ve said, he has missed the appointments, so has potentially missed some of the exciting parts. Has he been allowed to go to the ultrasounds? Hear the heart beat? If not, I wouldn\u2019t blame him for voicing his concerns.", "YTA.  You didn\u2019t trust him to respect your boundaries.  You haven\u2019t suggested he\u2019s untrustworthy.  Fetal movement is a huge indicator of fetal health.  Not telling him was an AH move.  I won\u2019t pretend to understand your pregnancy fear, but I hated being pregnant. I had body dysmorphia issues during pregnancy.  The thought of anyone touching my stomach made my skin crawl.  Yet I never would have denied my husband participating in my pregnancy, including feeling the baby move.  I love him, and it would have crushed him to not be as much of a part of it as he could.  He\u2019s my life partner and the father of my children.  Please continue to diligently seek counseling to work through your fears.", "YTA, this is very odd. You can have sex but he can\u2019t place his hand on your stomach to feel his child move? Sort yourself out.", "Very, very soft YTA. Not wanting to be touched while pregnant is your choice. I completely support that. But by not telling him things like the babies kicking at a point when it should be will cause unneeded worry about the baby. He has no way of knowing how things are going unless you tell him. Share information, but make it clear you still don't want to be touched. No hand on belly to feel kicks.", "INFO: why haven't you brought up this with a therapist or in couples therapy? So that you can work through it together?", "INFO: do you plan on divorcing your husband?", "Soft YTA because you lied to him about the kicking.  I can understand about not being able to cope with being touched so I don't thing you're the AH there.  However, your husband is compromising a lot of bonding opportunities, you not informing the baby is kicking is another thing that's kept from him.  Plus, he's probably being worried about the development of the baby since as far as he knew they hadn't kicked or moved you.  You've broken your husband trust by not being willing to trust him.", "OP, you already know yta, what are you looking for here? You are giving your fear the power to destroy your relationship. Is that what you want? Fear is a powerful emotion. We control our emotions or they control us. Please get help. People overcome fears and phobias every day.", "YTA - you didn\u2019t give him the opportunity to respect your boundaries. You made an assumption that left him feeling left out.", "YTA. You already put down the boundary, and he has been respecting it. I understand that fear isn't always rational, but neither is lying to your husband about whether or not the baby is kicking. Tell him from across the room if you're afraid he will try to touch your stomach, but he hasn't given any indications that you told us about that he was going to break that boundary. You didn't trust him, of course that hurts.", "You put all your needs first, your boundaries and even deprived your husband of important milestones of his child again for your boundaries.  YTA I hope your still in counseling", "YTA. Is he not meant to be your husband? Why not just have a honest talk about how you felt? I personally agree with him about it being about trust. There was literally no communication from your side and he was even worried something must have gone wrong. \n\nUnless he is the type of person to not listen to you and do what he wants. Then yes, I would say NTA", "This is a tough one. You should have told him and trusted him to respect your boundaries. He is a little right to be upset because even if he didn\u2019t touch your stomach it\u2019s still amazing to know when the baby is moving. \n\nSo I\u2019m giving a very soft YTA because in a relationship you have to trust and you didn\u2019t. Also unless there is a history of him not respecting boundaries then there was no reason not to trust him.", "If you can\u2019t trust him to respect your boundaries then I get it. If he\u2019s been respectful in every other way the YTA. \n\nI will say my husband wouldn\u2019t touch my belly or listen to he heart beat recording or anything like that. I was hurt by his seeming disinterest. So it\u2019s nice that he is interested, it\u2019s a good sign that he will be a good and involved father.", "You two should not be having children. You both need therapy. He'll eventually get a wife that includes him in the pregnancy process. YTA", "YTA. \n\nThis is so bizarre. How did you get pregnant if your husband isn't allowed to touch you? What on earth is wrong with letting him bond with his child? You sound like an absolute piece of work and I feel sorry for your husband and your unborn child. \n\nOut of curiosity, will your baby be allowed to touch you?", "Yta. And without serious therapy this will not end well for any of you, the child included", "This not fair to your husband. After all it is his baby too. You need to keep up with your therapy. You may be setting yourself up for post partum depression. \nI can't judge you one way or the other.", "YTA Please sell out couples counseling to learn how you both need to communicate. It\u2019s only going to get harder. \n\nPlease also look into counseling for yourself. Having an objective person who is only there to help you is invaluable, especially at difficult times in life. \n\nCongrats on the baby!", "Info: did he ever ask if everything was going alright (baby kicking normally, etc)? \n\nI can see how he would be concerned,  but he had every right to ask you if he *was* worried at all prior to the doctor appointment. Had you lied when he asked or refused to answer y w b t a.\n\nIf he has never asked or tried to discuss the baby's health with you on an ongoing basis, then I am going with NAH because I see where you're coming from as well as where he could be worried. \n\nThe two of you need to have more sessions in therapy and discuss this.", "YTA for not letting him know of the quickening. There are so few ways a father gets to feel connected to a pregnancy and that is one of them. It would have been easy to say, \"Please don't randomly try to feel my stomach, though. I'll let you know when baby is kicking and you can feel it\" and set those boundaries in a way that both of you could continue to experience the wonder of pregnancy.\n\nDoes he never hug you? Do you not cuddle in bed? Because that's when he may have felt it even if you didn't tell him. But if you aren't physical with each other at all, then there are other issues going on that need addressing. \n\nAnd if you have problems with being touched in general, you are going to have a really rough time with a baby and then a toddler.", "NAH. I get both sides. I didn\u2019t want anyone (including my partner sometimes) touching me while I was pregnant. I also understand your husband feeling left out - the times when I was comfortable with my partner feeling the kicks were really special for him. I think you both have valid points and just need to talk it out. Maybe a compromise could be that you tell him when baby is kicking and it\u2019s visible? Seeing the kicks and pushes from baby is really cool and special too.", "I\u2019m sorry. YTA. This is your husband. A man who got you pregnant and we all know how that works. I hate being pregnant. I hate people touching my stomach\u2026.so I feel you there\u2026but you could have at least told him and sympathized with the fact you know he wants to touch and you appreciate him respecting your boundaries. Lying is NEVER good. Eventually he will get to actually see the baby punching and kicking out of your stomach.", "YTA- and deep down, your husband is probably questioning his decision to have a child with you. \n\nYou\u2019ll be divorced in 6 years or less, guaranteed.", "I don\u2019t think there are any assholes here. Pregnancy is a very vulnerable time. I do think that you need to talk with your spouse and continue to explore your fears about why you don\u2019t think that he will honor your boundaries. I think that is the biggest issue. And talk about ways you can create than bond before birth, perhaps using an at home Doppler to listen to the heartbeat? And would you consider snuggling with your spouse belly to back when you are further along and the baby is bigger? That way you can control the amount of contact and no hands are involved. There are ways to bond that you can control, that will make you feel comfortable. I wish you peace.", "INFO: Has your husband disrespected/pushed your stated boundaries before? When you say your boundary about being touched was \"upsetting to him\", what did this look like? Did he try to argue against it, was he angry, etc?\n\nIf he's been respectful and supportive till now, a very gentle Y-T-A. He probably spent the last several weeks increasingly worried about the baby's health. You stated your boundaries about being touched - it seems like you did *not* state that you would be reserving key information about your health, progress, noteworthy events, etc. It's fair for him to now be worried that you'll keep some key info from him that *is* an emergency, or would be relevant in an emergency.\n\nBut I'm reserving judgment unless those questions are answered, because him being mad about \"completely being shut out of the bonding process\" just because he can't touch *your* stomach suggests to me that he feels entitled to do so and is willing to guilt you about your boundaries during this vulnerable time (and there are definitely other ways for him to bond!). \n\nBut either way, instead of just quietly withholding info from him, if you feel that you don't trust him and he's being unsupportive/disrespectful, you *need to communicate that to him.* Like, \"I've been worried to tell you when milestones happening because I'm afraid you'll do xyz\" and then work it out from there.", "YTA, you lied to him and caused him to worry about his child. He wasn\u2019t asking to touch and you didn\u2019t trust him to respect you. Honestly, if I were him, I\u2019d be questioning if this was a marriage I could trust to stay in.", "NTA. Unless you lied to him (rather than just not telling him unprompted), then he did not ask you about what you were experiencing. That's on him. He knows how alien and invasive this feels to you; instead of being territorial and focused on himself, he should be supportive of your experience and fears and the way you are coping. There are a lot of changes happening to your body, and it is your body. Full stop. Just because he is the father does not give him rights over your body and your experience (yes, this is only my opinion, which will be culturally and religiously contentious to some). Yes, he is equally responsible for the fetus, but until it is an independent living being outside of your body, the fetus is still part of your body. You are coping with a huge change to your body that is triggering all kinds of emotions and reactions due to your history and of course due to the barrage of pregnancy hormones. He is also coping with his own triggers and childhood trauma... but that is his to cope with, just like your own triggers are yours to cope with. Yes, you are partners, but you are each also independent entities who are responsible for yourself and your actions.\n\nI hope you keep going to therapy (or go back), and consider going together as well as individually. For your relationship to continue to grow and remain strong, you need good communication and trust. This pregnancy makes that hard, with all of its triggers for you both. It takes more work in hard times to keep a relationship healthy, and as parents, you'll need that strong partnership to help both of you and your child grow and thrive.", "ESH. You should have told him the milestone because he was worried something was wrong. You could have told him and just asked him to not touch your bump. He is definitely TA for leaving like that.", "NAH except I don't think you are quite empathising with him. It's perfectly fair for him to say he's been shut out of the bonding process, because he has. That doesn't mean he is trying to guilt you into changing your boundaries, but you should probably acknowledge how hard this is for him since it sounds like he is acknowledging how hard it is for you.", "[deleted]", "YTA and a really big one too!", "YTA\nWow I already feel sorry for your child and husband. What happened too you as a child?", "YTA. You need a therapist.", "If you cant let your HUSBAND touch your BELLY then this aint gonna work hunny, im sorry you either need to change or look for a lawyer YTA", "All the people saying you're the asshole seem to be missing the fact that OP has a literal phobia. Although I will say I'm not sure it's the best idea to be pregnant with a phobia of it, I'll say N T A. I think your boundaries are reasonable.\n\nEdit: you guys are right OP YTA, lying was wrong", "NAH.\n\nPregnancy can be terrifying, worse if you already have a fear of it.  I can understand not wanting to be touched, not wanting to risk being touched.  You should have told your husband, though, about the baby's kicks.  He has every right to be upset because he was afraid that there was something wrong with the baby.  Normally this would be a Y T A but this is a primal fear for you, not a dislike.  It would be like someone with a fear of flying being forced onto an airplane and coping by drinking a ton of alcohol and trying to pass out until the flight is over.", "Did you lie, though? If he never asked and you never offered, it's so wrong to call that a lie. If he had history of pushing boundaries, i don't blame you for keeping this to yourself. If it was so important to him, he should have had the testicular fortitude to ask right out. NTA", "ESH- OP, you are ice cold and not in a good way.\n\nChanging my vote to YTA after reading your comments and seeing you lied to your husband about feeling anything and your fears that he might have an emotional reaction rather than a logical one. \n\nYou need therapy. \n\nAnd your child will too, God help that poor child with such a cold, cold woman as its mother.", "A little bit. \n\nI get both arguments and if I was in your shoes I probably wouldn\u2019t want to be constantly having my stomach touched but from a guys point of view I would want to know just so I could share the moment and, boundaries allowing, maybe be able to feel \u2018my\u2019 child moving for the first time. For guys being able to feel a poke or kick for half a second is the only physical connection we have until birth and means a lot IMO. With that being said I think he overreacted by spending the night at a friends.", "YTA. I lost my twins at 18 weeks and my husband never got to feel them kick. I cant imagine if I had made it further and kept it from him....the only bonding he got was from rubbing my tummy and going to appointments. Just tell him if it's too much...but don't keep a loving father from bonding with his child", "YTA. I\u2019m very anxious for your future child. A young child is not going to deal well with not being able to touch their mom. They cling and take comfort from you. I worry that this is going to end badly for all three of you.\n\nI\u2019m equally worried about your marriage. There\u2019s a big difference between touch and speaking. While I think it\u2019s an odd boundary for an expecting couple, if you can\u2019t communicate \u201chi, honey, I don\u2019t want you to touch my belly, but the bean has started moving\u201d then that\u2019s a huge red flag. Either that you\u2019re terrible at communication or that your husband is incapable of listening to you say \u201cno.\u201d Whichever it is, that\u2019s a bad sign.", "YTA for all this failed communication and taking this from him too.", "Sounds like you two made a mistake in getting married...", "If you don't feel confident you can trust your husband to respect the order \"don't touch a part of my body\" just because he knew the baby was kicking, you shouldn't be married to him. Withholding information about your mutual child's health was NOT the right strategy. YTA", "YTA you didn\u2019t have to let him touch, but you could have told the poor guy. It\u2019s a big milestone snd he must have been worrying. And I mean, how concerns are right. If you can\u2019t tell him about one of the most basic parts of pregnancy, how does he know you won\u2019t hide labour?", "Fake. You don\u2019t feel a \u201cbaby kicking.\u201d You feel gas. For weeks. Nobody else can feel it anyway, not for a while. Then you feel feet under your fucking rib cage and you never sleep again.", "When I gave birth, the drs and nurses pushed on my stomach and the dr was elbow deep in my vagina trying to pull the after birth back out.   Lol I too had a boundary of no one was allowed to touch my stomach. That was meant for everyone but my SO and health care team as well.   I definitely can see why he feels left out.", "YTA. Why are you married if you can\u2019t trust telling your partner the baby kicked. Also curious why you don\u2019t feel comfortable enough with your husband touching your belly. I don\u2019t like others touching my belly but I often tell my husband when baby is kicking because it\u2019s his baby too and it helps with bonding.", "YTA. Should've let him decide if he was going to respect your boundaries or not. You basically decided and assumed for him. Which btw, someone else on here brought up a great question... how did ya'll have sex but can't stand the thought of him rubbing your belly?\n\nDad seems to be a well spoken person, he communicated with you without lashing out or calling you names.

My husband (27M) has always wanted a family. We compromised and decided to use a surrogate, but I ended up pregnant before we could put our plans in motion. My husband was very hesitant - his mother shared similar views to me on pregnancy and their relationship is very sour because of it. We both went to therapy, individually and together, had a lot of talks, and we decided to go through with it.\n\nI'm warming up to a lot of this, but one hard boundary for me is I don't want people touching my stomach. It's even hard at the doctor's office but I do it because it's for the good of our child. I've articulated this boundary to my husband and even though it was upsetting to him, he respects it, for my benefit.\n\nI've been feeling baby kick for about 3 weeks now, but I haven't told my husband about it. I'm just afraid that he would push the boundary or feel left out, so I've just been keeping it to myself. \n\nWe've rarely been able to go to appointments together, so Thursday was the first in several weeks we were able to attend together. My husband mentioned he was worried that I was so late in pregnancy without feeling any movement and the OB got very concerned, asking me if I \"felt the kicks dropping off.\" I told her no, everything was fine, and even though my husband didn't say anything, I could tell he put everything together.\n\nHe was silent for the rest of the appointment and the whole ride home. He asked why I lied to him and I told him just what I said here. He accused me of not trusting him to respect my boundaries and said he needed to stay at a friend's that night. He came home yesterday and apologized for leaving but said it was a very serious violation of his trust. He even told me \"If you can't be honest about this, how do I know you'll be honest when you're in labor? Or if something bad happens?\" That felt harsh to me. Those are real emergencies. This wasn't.\n\nHe says it is hard for him already to know he has been completely shut out of the bonding process - which I don't think is fair at all - and that being treated like this has upset him further. I felt that he was exaggerating. I talked it over with my mom and she agreed that I was harsh to him and should've at least let him feel once and told him when it was happening, so he could feel included. That's too much to me. I don't feel comfortable putting the boundary down at all and I feel like that gives him the opportunity to push it.\n\nWas I in the wrong? Am I being outrageous?\n\nAITA for not telling my husband when our baby was kicking?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It makes her itchy and uncomfortable\u2026 and she isn\u2019t the pregnant one.\n\nIf OP is in the same position, and has decided with the help of the therapist to move forward with the pregnancy.

Although it's her decision to keep it, I think this is going to be a bit more sensitive than most pregnancies. I don't think it's fair on OP to compare the intimacy of sex and the intimacy of pregnancy. That's when your body starts changing and becoming extremely uncomfortable. Not wanting to be touched is normal. Now OP is experiencing something she didn't want in the first place and that just adds on another layer of uncomfortableness and insecurity.\n\nAnother thing: This is OPs body still.

How is he supposed to trust you when you lied to him about the well being of his child? If you have a boundary about not being touched that your decision,  but right now it's not all about you.  It's about your child and you deliberately withheld information from the other parent.

You not telling him also probably made him feel embarrassed in front of your doctor for being the only person in the room who was uniformed about the baby's development. I get not wanting to be touched, but purposefully lying to him and letting him be concerned until he had to ask the doctor himself what was going on with you and the baby is incredibly selfish.", "Do you often lie to him? Because he has every right to now doubt and second guess anything you say. You have single handedly destroyed trust in your relationship because you chose not to communicate.

He asked several times if she could feel the baby kick and she lied and said no. This making him worry that there was a problem.", "The question I have is did they just *not talk about the pregnancy at all?* Did he ever ask or mention the baby kicking where she lied or avoided the question? If she lied/avoided then yes she is an asshole. She could have said the baby is kicking and that she doesn't want him to touch her.
