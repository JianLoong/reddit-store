At the welcome booth, they tell you to look out for \u201chidden garden gnomes and fairies\u201d throughout the gardens. As I was walking through one of the first trails I ended up behind a large family with 3 small children. The frequently would stop, look around for a few seconds, take a few more steps and repeat. They told me that they were looking for the gnomes that are hidden and I reply that I will keep an eye out for them. Not being too keen on following the family the entire time, I took a left at a fork in the path and the family went right. Immediately upon turning the corner, while the family was still visible and in ear shot, I spotted a little yellow gnome tucked away on some rocks. Knowing that they were going in the opposite direction and that there are 9 acres of garden I was worried the kids wouldn\u2019t come across the hidden friend. I waved to the family and said \u201cHey! I just found a gnome! Make sure you look for the color yellow!\u201d They were so close that I didn\u2019t even need to shout and  continued don my path. The girls go running towards my area and start to look around. The path I was on was very steep so it took me a while to navigate safely and the mom catches up to me and says \u201cOnly a jerk would ruin the surprise for these little kids.\u201d I tried to apologize and I mentioned that I knew they were excited and worried that the group wouldn\u2019t go down this path and I made sure not to point out the direct spot and the mom just scoffs and says \u201cthis is a game for kids, why is an adult even doing this alone? Isn\u2019t that kind of creepy?\u201d I apologized again and said that there is no age limit on enjoying nature and continued on the path feeling uncomfortable with the whole exchange. \n\nAITA for ruining the fun of these kids?\n\nEdit: I ran into the group again on the trail and the kids spoke to me to tell me they found another gnome (there are 10 in total) I said \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and looked away. The mother said nothing. \n\nEdit 2: after the hike I visited the gift shop and discovered that every kid is given a map of all 10 gnomes (and fairies I guess) that gives the general location.

Where has Mom been?  \n\n\nINFO: Were the *children* upset?", "Nta imo.\n\nIt's not creepy for an adult to do something like this alone and it's annoying when mothers like her try to limit what adults can do because it's \"for kids\"\n\nYou didn't ruin thier fun, you helped them.", "NTA. The only way to be one in this scenario is if you tell kids to find gnomes and fairies and the place doesn\u2019t actually have any!", "Good grief, you're NTA. You just encountered one of those miserable people who is all too eager to be offended or annoyed. We all know the types- when they go into a restaurant, actually hope someone screws up their order so they have a chance to berate someone.", "NTA. It sounds like the kids were excited by your *hint* and not in anyway upset. They even went so far as to tell you how many they found - clearly they appreciated it. Your mom needs to cool it IMO, gnomes are fun at any age!", "NTA. You even talked to them and told them you would let them know. If they wanted to keep it a surprise, that was their chance to say that.", "NTA, you gave the kids fresh energy and they didn't miss the gnome. It sucks the mom is such a prude jerk.", "NAH.  Your intentions were good so you\u2019re not TA.  But I also understand why this might have sent up alarm bells for the mom, so she\u2019s not TA for making it clear she wanted you to keep your distance.", "~~YTA.

Unless someone asks you for a hint, don't provide one.

All you did was give them a hint. It didn\u2019t sound like the kids minded. You said you\u2019d keep an eye out and you did.", "I mean if you give the hint right next to the gnome....people are not stupid", "Nope! And they just found me on the trail again (I\u2019m sitting on a bench looking at a pool) and they told me they found another gnome. Not wanting to escalate anything I just said \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and looked away. The mother walked passed me and said nothing", "\u201cPrude\u201d is an odd word to use here.", "The kids approached me. They were still so close that I didn\u2019t even need to raise my voice. I never once got within 10 feet of their group. Unfortunately the paths are so narrow and so steep it is difficult to pass anyone, there are no railings so I thought it best to wait until we hit a fork in the path. I ended up seeing them again and the kids spoke to me so I just nodded to acknowledge them and nothing else.", "Would that make me TA though? Or would it make mom a control freak? Should she not have controlled her children or told them not to speak with strangers? She also could have said \u201cno thank you\u201d to my offer of keeping an eye out. Through many many years of therapy I am now of the opinion that a person is not responsible for the reaction of someone who has not communicated a boundary, need or desire. People are not mind readers and shouldn\u2019t have to guess how someone feels about something. There were plenty of opportunities for intervention and I am not going to ignore someone that has spoken to me. That\u2019s just rude.", "So there were 10 of these hidden gnomes across the entire garden. I learned after the fact that each kid was given a map with the general locations of each find and I have not given them any more information than they already had. I had told the kids that I would keep an eye out after they approached me first. If that was not welcome, then the mother should have said as much.", "There were 9 other gnomes to find. This was not the only one. After the hike, I went to the gift shop and learned that all kids are handed a map with the general location of each gnome giving hardly any more description than I had.", "Prudish about OP's presence as they stated it was primarily for children.", "I\u2019m talking about the point where you returned to them to tell them about the gnome.  That is an unusual thing for a random adult to do with a group of young kids.  Not bad, just unusual.  But unusual tends to set off alarm bells.", "Sorry, i misread what you wrote. You  did  established rapport with the family and were involved in their activity, so you had reasonable belief you were part of the gnome search group. Mom did overreact.", "And fair enough. I am really on the fence, N TA vs E S H but some people do like to find every one on their own. For the sense of accomplishment.", "But I didn\u2019t have to return to them. That\u2019s the whole point. I turned to go in another direction after telling them I would keep an eye out and saw the gnome. I didn\u2019t have to shout, I didn\u2019t have to go back to them, I didn\u2019t even leave my spot. I just turned my head and spoke. The paths are narrow and steep and much of the garden is open. Despite being on separate paths we were close enough where if someone reached out a hand, we could have touched.", "OP didn't return to them, they saw the gnome right as they walked away and turned around to tell the family.", "Lol thanks for that. I learned afterwards that the kids even had a map of all 10 gnomes so they already knew that there was a gnome in that location.", "For sure. But couldn\u2019t the mother have easily said \u201cno thank you\u201d when I told the kids I would keep an eye out if it was about the accomplishment. I just feel like there was opportunity for the parent to get involved much sooner and without calling me a creep", "You are being oddly aggressive here considering I never said you were TA.", "That\u2019s true, I got defensive. I hate being thought of as creepy! Hah I\u2019m a 32 yr old woman and kids are often drawn to me. I\u2019m on a solo cross country road trip and am just trying to love my best life!\n\nEDIT: Nope, I\u2019m taking this comment back. Saying that I was being \u201coddly aggressive\u201d was meant to shame and gaslight me into accepting your opinion about the situation. It is not \u201coddly aggressive\u201d to restate facts and ensure readers have clarity around the situation. Your rating of NAH is besides the point. While trafficking is a real concern for parents, defending the mother\u2019s actions outside of these specific set of circumstances was just meant to paint me in a negative light.", "you\u2019re definitely not being agressive!", "Hoping this wasn\u2019t sarcasm as I\u2019m autistic and can\u2019t tell the difference! Haha but FR comments like these have been used almost all of my life to put me down and break me of the little confidence I do have. It\u2019s exhausting to be gaslit for validating your feelings/experiences and it happens all the time to neurodiverse people!!", "NTA. You were trying to be sweet. Don\u2019t even think about it again. That other mom sounds like a real buzzkill. I\u2019m an adult who goes to the botanical gardens by myself all the time. It\u2019s beautiful. Stop feeling bad about this encounter."]}
