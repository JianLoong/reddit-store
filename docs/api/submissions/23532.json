Given your history of PTSD and that presumably your father knows about your history makes it even worse, I'm so sorry.\n\nYou're doing the work to work through the trauma and being told to \"chill out\" certainly doesn't help.", "NTA. I'm horrified on your behalf that your FATHER would find your terror so amusing. I just don't understand a parent wanting to traumatize their child. He's obviously complained to other family members that you can't take a joke. I would ask them to describe in detail what they found funny about triggering your fear that you're going to therapy for. Ask them if they would do that to their own child and why would they. Make them explain every last thing.\n\nI would have a separate conversation with dad and explain to him that he's a person you should be able to trust and depend on. He has broken trust with you and needs to rebuild it as you no longer feel safe around him. I wish you all the best in you healing journey.", "NTA.

He should be apologizing to you.", "NTA, I also have PTSD and have the same trigger. My dad did this to me once. I reacted similar (if not worse). He got mad and went to his room to cool off. \n\nOnce we both had cooled off, I had a conversation with him. Told him why it scared me and explained how that put my head back into the event that gave me the PTSD. It took time for him to understand what I meant by that but eventually he did understand.\n\nI have an uncle (not blood just friends of the family that have been around since before I was born) who did this after being warned not to. I reacted before I knew what happened, punched him in the face and left a pretty nice black eye considering I'm a pretty petite woman. This man is more of my dad's brother than any of his actual brothers, he was angry and started yelling at my dad to do something about his \"disrespectful\" daughter. My dad told him to leave before he gives him a black eye to match the one I gave him. \n\nSometimes communication is needed to correct AH behavior, other times people are just AHs. \n\nIn this situation you aren't the AH.

A lot of the time, the victim absorbes the joke, and the violator walks away ignorant of the damage they caused.

Shift the blame on you !

That's not how you treat people you love. \n\nThis is why we people with ptsd sit in corners with our backs to the wall and are hypervigilant who is near us. So many assholes think its funny.

From what imagine this incident to be is far more terrifying that a car crash or something less personal.
