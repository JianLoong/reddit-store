They\u2019re tormenting you, over your trauma. Not cool. Major dick move.

Given your history of PTSD and that presumably your father knows about your history makes it even worse, I'm so sorry.\n\nYou're doing the work to work through the trauma and being told to \"chill out\" certainly doesn't help.", "NTA. I'm horrified on your behalf that your FATHER would find your terror so amusing. I just don't understand a parent wanting to traumatize their child. He's obviously complained to other family members that you can't take a joke. I would ask them to describe in detail what they found funny about triggering your fear that you're going to therapy for. Ask them if they would do that to their own child and why would they. Make them explain every last thing.\n\nI would have a separate conversation with dad and explain to him that he's a person you should be able to trust and depend on. He has broken trust with you and needs to rebuild it as you no longer feel safe around him. I wish you all the best in you healing journey.", "NTA.

PTSD is not something anyone can do a joke.", "NTA- that was an AH move by your father even more so considering he knows of your trauma and yet he still thought that was funny?\nEveryone telling you to lighten up is an AH too, they are just trying to minimise behaviour like your fathers\u2026", "NTA - imo, it\u2019s never funny to scare people, ptsd or not.\n\nmy partner had ptsd and tells everyone about it so they know what would trigger them. there have been people in the past who trigger it intentionally, and that is one of the cruelest things i have ever seen someone do.\n\nyou do NOT need to \u201cchill out\u201d. your family need to learn to be respectful. if you haven\u2019t already and you are able to, tell them your boundaries and what to avoid doing with you. then they have no excuses in future, even if it is \u201cjust a joke\u201d to them.", "nta, wtf is wrong with your dad?!\n  \nfuck people who do this shit, even if the target DOESN'T have trauma. haha, you're scared and upset! what fun! it's so mean-spirited.", "NTA- that was incredibly thoughtless of your father. He should be apologizing to you.", "NTA, I also have PTSD and have the same trigger. My dad did this to me once. I reacted similar (if not worse). He got mad and went to his room to cool off. \n\nOnce we both had cooled off, I had a conversation with him. Told him why it scared me and explained how that put my head back into the event that gave me the PTSD. It took time for him to understand what I meant by that but eventually he did understand.\n\nI have an uncle (not blood just friends of the family that have been around since before I was born) who did this after being warned not to. I reacted before I knew what happened, punched him in the face and left a pretty nice black eye considering I'm a pretty petite woman. This man is more of my dad's brother than any of his actual brothers, he was angry and started yelling at my dad to do something about his \"disrespectful\" daughter. My dad told him to leave before he gives him a black eye to match the one I gave him. \n\nSometimes communication is needed to correct AH behavior, other times people are just AHs. \n\nIn this situation you aren't the AH. Your dad's behavior is AH. If you can, communicate if you can't because of his doing then, he's just an AH.", "NTA. Someone who thinks it\u2019s funny to cause others distress is seriously toxic.

A lot of the time, the victim absorbes the joke, and the violator walks away ignorant of the damage they caused.
