Your GF should get her own apartment and you can revisit lving together in a year.", "NAH but I'm curious about two things:\n\n1. Aside from living for free - and maybe that is THE answer - why would it make you 'miserable to have to live anywhere else'?\n2. Why exactly do you feel her moving in with you is the most logical option? You're acting like this is a foregone conclusion and maybe again it just comes down to 'I don't pay rent now, and it would be silly to move and pay rent.' Is that the immutable logic that you think she should have accounted for?", "NAH, If you own an apartment that can support both of you, then there's no good reason for you to leave that and start paying rent. If that's a dealbreaker for her, then that's a dealbreaker. She's not necessarily wrong to want to start somewhere fresh with her partner, but if that's what she wants then that means that partner isn't you.\n\nYou have a space you want to keep that you're comfortable in.\n\nShe wants the experience of finding a place with a partner.\n\nThose are mutually exclusive situations unless one of you makes a pretty severe compromise.", "NAH. \n\nClearly you both didn't communicate what the expectations were on both sides. You don't want to move and she assumed you'd be moving in together elsewhere. Figure it out. If you don't want to move, then the choice is hers to move elsewhere alone or to move in with you. If you want her to move in, the kind thing to do is to give up some things and compromise on some new items she might want if it's reasonable or if she's offering to pay etc. \n\nPersonally think 6 months is too early simply because you two threw out an idea and didn't even think to discuss logistics.", "NAH\n\nTake a step back and communicate more guys.", "NAH, but I think you need to reframe your thinking about this, and that it must inform how you talk about this to your gf or other love interests going forward. This apartment is like a child or a sick relative you care for that will never die. \n\nThis apartment is YOURS. It\u2019s close to your heart, it will never be anyone else\u2019s the way it is yours, no matter how many aesthetic changes you make for her.  You know that, and so does she. \n\nIt\u2019s also, as you say, not practical living space. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not interested in renting out the apartment and living elsewhere. \n\nSo, I don\u2019t see how your feelings towards your apartment is compatible with really merging your life with someone else in the way the average person assumes. They can never hope to have equal say in your current of future living choices, and must simply accept that living in an impractical apartment is the price of admission to being with you. \n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that in itself is wrong, but I\u2019m thinking that \u201cI will never leave this apartment\u201d is almost \u201ckids/no kids\u201d level of important disclosure to make, because this will be a deal breaker for a lot of people.", "NAH, simple case of you both making an assumption. However, this is a bit AHy:\n\n'I told her that I wasnt going to give up the place and I would consider her making some interior changes for it to fit her lifestyle'\n\nI don't know many people who would want to move into their partner's home under these terms. It makes it clear that you'll always see it as 'your' place, which is likely she wanted to get a different place.", "NAH.  You both have valid points.  Neither of you are an AH.  Whether or not you can come to a solution is a different question.", "INFO - what \"not the most practical living space\" means? Is there enough space for her stuff? Big bed? Space where she can work or relax?", "NAH - you both just we\u2019re approaching this from different perspectives, I do see your logic but she wasn\u2019t being an AH", "NAH\n\nYou can want what you want, but she can decide that's not gonna work for her.", "Info- how big is your place, how many rooms?", "INFO, if she did move in how much agency would she get over the place? It\u2019s a bachelor pad right now, would you enforce it stay a bachelor pad, or work with her to redecorate together? \n\nIt\u2019s a very real thing that when someone moves into a place their partner owns, they get kinda steamrolled and the place never feels like their own too\n\nAs an aside, 6 months is a bit quick to fully move in together.", "It may be early to move in together but if you did stay at your place you'd both be saving money (I'd suggest separate saving accounts just in case) otherwise spent on rent that could be a deposit on a house together in the future. If it's serious and she wants commitment and to start looking at places, that checks both boxes. You're looking at houses for a few years down the line, working out how much you need and the kind of place you'd both like. Also NTA", "NAH, but you need to be aware of what you're asking her here. Presumably, if you're a couple and you're not making payments on the apartment, you're not going to ask for any rent. Still, you own the place and if the relationship ends, she'll lose her place to live. You're insisting that she take a much bigger risk in order for you two to cohabitate. You're going to need to talk about that and figure out what practical measures to take so that she will feel safe taking this risk.", "NTA. Staying in an apartment that you can live in for free is just good financial sense. It doesn\u2019t mean that you have to live there forever, but it\u2019s a reasonable expectation now.\n\nThis is just one of those things where you both have to decide together whether the relationship (or at least cohabiting) is more important than the four walls around you. If you think that living together is truly a good idea, then let her know that you\u2019ll find ways to make the space both of yours, but moving is just not in the cards for you right now. The ball can be in her court, but I wouldn\u2019t rush living together if you think it\u2019s going to cause more problems than it solves.", "\"So i've been seeing my girlfriend for about six months\"\n\nAlready I know this is a mistake. And then neither of you is willing to budge on logistics. I don't think either of you is ready for the big step of living together; that said, I do think logic is more on your side. I can't imagine choosing to pay extra money in rent when you have somewhere to live for free. So because that seems, silly? I'm going to vote\n\nNTA", "Moving in together after six months is a little idiotic **BUT** if this is something you really want to do, you can sublease your current place and use that money to pay ***your (only your)*** part of the new rent.  From your description it sounds like you can get a pretty penny for it.\n\n\"  nowhere that i would enjoy living at more than this apartment Its got everything a i could want a pool a home theater its got 2 stories and plenty of space its lovely\"\n\nI wouldn't want to move either", "YTA  for thinking of moving after 6 months. That's quite fast, and not compromising on where you borh want to live.\n\nI have this at the moment. My partner has a house she owned with her ex-husband, but she can't afford it on her own whereas I could easily afford it and she wants me to move in. It has a lot of her personality on it, a good location, and extremely convenient for her work (not mine but I have a footloose job as a developer) and coffee bars and shops. The point is I want to move somewhere we both decide, not live in someone's existing house that they like but I don't (architecturally not my thing, but others may like). She gets it, but I think I'll have to live there for 1 or 2 years whilst she looks after her 19 and 21 year old kids (they need their mum's help sporadically) that keep boomeranging back. I have no problem with the logic of the house but hate it's not \"our\" house and would not move there without agreement we move elsewhere pretty soon afterwards. So YTA.", "NAH. You naturally don't want to move as if you do you'll have to pay rent. That financial consideration would be enough for me to not consider moving. But she's not an A H for wanting you two to get your own place.\n\nI have known couples that lived very successfully apart.", "YTA\n\nThere are other options to the two of you living in your apartment. You can get a place together and rent your place out and get passive income. She wants something that can be both of yours. You want things your way. The two cannot coexist.", "YTA\n\nShe isn't going to feel like your partner if you tell her that her only option is to move into your place and only change what you tell her she is allowed to change. It will create an uneven power dynamic in the relationship, which will kill the relationship.\n\nIf you're not ok with equally sharing your space with her and letting her make her fair share of the design decisions, then you aren't ready for her to move in.\n\nI get that your apartment is awesome, but an actual partner will expect that the space you live in is theirs as much as it's yours. I think you need to reflect on that before you move a partner in.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Stop. It\u2019s only been 6 months. It\u2019s way too soon for moving in.

But there might also be some legitimate reasons why she doesn\u2019t want to, some can be tackled together other not so much. Possible reasons I can think off of the top of my head: \n\n- Security: she might worry that in case you get into a fight you can just kick her out on a wimp. That would be my biggest concern. But can be tackled with setting up a lease agreement with a certain notice period. So that legally you can\u2019t just kick her out immediately if you feel like it one day. \n- Location/commuting distance\n- Space: does she have certain needs (e.g. home office) that your home doesn\u2019t fulfill? \n- Feeling like it\u2019s not hers: that might never go away fully but would you be okay to have her input on decorations? Or her bringing some of her own furniture? Or maybe replacing some (thinking about the stereotypical bachelor flat item: black leather couch - sorry, that would need to go if it was me). Are you open to allow her to chance stuff so it feels like a home for both of you? And does he stuff fit?", "you could rent it out big boy", "NTA but I'd say see if she's right.

Who would want to go from free housing to paying rent?", "To add, it seems a little nutty to fully move in and share a lease after 6 months of dating if financial circumstances aren\u2019t making this a must. Adding a far more serious layer to such a young relationship could complicate things, especially if things ever end while the lease you share is still in effect.", "I was thinking this too. Moving in together after 6 months? That way too soon.", "Its decently big idr the square footage but its got 4 bedrooms 2 of which are currently repurposed", "She would lose a place to live but would have a lot extra savings from not having to pay rent so would easily be able to afford a new place to live.

It's fair for her to have a different perspective or preference, or to not agree that it's the best place for you together. \n\nThis is not to say you're an AH for not wanting to move, but there are mentions in your post that make it seem like you feel this should be obvious or indisputable, ie 'the most logical option'. You having an opinion or preference doesn't overrule her own. You might want to consider how you're wording this in discussions with her, and really should probably wait until you're more ready to decide together.", "Square footage?", "My girlfriend moved in after 3 months.\n\nThat was 21 years ago.\n\nThe only change was when I started calling her \"wife\"\n\n\nNo one gets to decide what is \"too soon\" for others.", "I bet it is huge too but we just don't have the details to really say it's the only choice for OP. Perhaps he could rent out the place he has now for a higher amount than he'd be paying to share a place with his GF, there is also location (ie if she will incur a lot of cost / lost time to commute from his location versus getting one in a more neutral one).
