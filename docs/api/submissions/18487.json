I had a wound vac, two more surgeries, countless aspirations, then mrsa traveled had a septic miscarriage, now a kidney abscess and my bone marrow is down to 10%. It\u2019s been miserable. I was NEVER overweight but I lost all my muscle, and it\u2019s not coming back as much as I\u2019m trying. It sucks so much when people say I look great wow you lost weight you aren\u2019t puffy (my MILs sister said I wasn\u2019t as puffy as I was at my wedding shower, oh fuck off). Im literally dying, I am 30 and now on short term disability, my organs are failing, bone marrow isn\u2019t going to magically come back and my blood cells are deformed. The worst compliment was from my manager, I\u2019m a med rep, he was like oh wow you lost so much you look great. Makeup hides a lot of sin, but seriously you know I\u2019ve been sick and somehow still working my ass off. Why would you say that?", "Pretty sure mil would do that too in this case", "I hate to say this but there was a post where MIL wanted to hide the wheelchair of OP's relative on the photos...", "Add flab to her chin and make the back of her arms sag.", "I fucking CACKLED at how deliciously petty that would be! If (when?) OP gets that photoshop done, I wish I could see it.", "Or make her dress pea soup green.", "NTA. \n\nWatch out for your new MIL and SIL, though. You are probably stuck with them for as long as you both shall live. Really pissing them off this early in the marriage is going to cause trouble. \n\nI completely agree with you that what she wants to do is horrible and rude, but when she does it and you post the original, real photos under her doctored photos, she looks like the complete jerk. Everyone who was at the wedding or knows these people will know that the photos have been altered, so feel free to calm her out for her work on social media.", "NTA but, tell her that it\u2019s understandable because you had to get her touched up too! When she asks what you had done, just laugh and say \u2018oh you\u2019ll be able to tell right away! But don\u2019t worry! It\u2019s only minor to make you look healthier\u2019 don\u2019t actually photoshop her in any images.\n\nThen watch her brain implode as she tries to figure out what you did.", "Please photoshop her to look a little fatter. Just a little so she won\u2019t realise it\u2019s been edited, she just \u201cdidn\u2019t look like she thought she did\u201d", "Husband needs to step in and take care of this or risk being \u201cphotoshopped out\u201d.", "It is petty, good for you! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude01 NTA.", "NTA I'd be so hurt if I saw a photo of myself posted where I was photoshopped to look thinner", "NTA, I dont care if your born in any decade, century, etc, you cant force sexist/stereotype Beauty standards onto people. Imagine \\[and I can, cause im a bit large myself\\] you have a bit of weight, and someone goes, ''Oh im gonna photoshop you to be skinnier, your to fat'' id be pissed, and ive taken worst stuff then that.", "NTA", "Stay petty, OP!  It beats being mean and humiliating other people on line.  Why on earth would you give your MIL the very thing she needs to hurt your sisters in public?  \n\nNTA", "YTA for keeping the photos away from all the in laws when it was your MIL who made the nasty comment.", "YTA\n\nI don't understand, if your IL photoshop herself and post it to her personal media completely unrelated to you, it won't change the picture you'll hold in your wedding book.\n\nI mean I understand it's your choice but I would personally don't mind, if she want to photoshop herself who am I to say no?", "I'm an editor and will do the edits for free after reading this story.", "Okay the MIL is rude. I get that healthy isn\u2019t the same as skinny.\n\nBut OP literally called her sister chubby. Not \u201cshe\u2019s an athlete and has muscle\u201d chubby. \n\nHer sister is chubby AND unhealthy.", "She wants to photoshop the op\u2019s sister not herself", "the camera adds 10 pounds. So does photoshop.", "Make them super fat please", "Agreed. Underweight, anemic, severely depressed, sleep deprived, was me in my 20s. I was miserable and suicidal.\n\nNow I'm fat, sleep better than I ever have, my depression is better than ever, and I'm happy! If my doctor says my weight is a problem, I'll deal with it. Otherwise I'm just glad I'm happy!", "Ho yeah thanks I didn't understand this detail, definitely NTA, photoshop someone else? wtf", "i was looking to see if someone else said that, and here you are. i second this motion lol", "Scanners and cameras exist", "I do and teach Photoshop professionally and will 100% volunteer to do this for free. Petty for the win!", "Well done you for not wanting a socially expected \u2018perfect\u2019 for your wedding photos. You are an awesome sister. \n\nHuge NTA from me", "NTA and how refreshing to read a story about a bride who has a healthy relationship with her bridal party\u2026..love your reaction to mil. No drama just, fine, no photos for you. Way to go op \u2026no f\u2019s for mil !", "nta", "NTA Give them really low resolution versions so anything they do will look terrible", "NTA but if she did do it, I would photo shop MIL / SIL to make them the same size as your MOH and share THAT photo !  Tell them 'they look healthier'", "NTA\n\nGood for you! I respect your decision.", "You can either have the pictures and use them as they are, or you get nothing.\n\nNTA", "NTA and I love that you are standing up for them.\nYou are an awesome sis", "It\u2019s judgemental for you to think the effort they put into their looks is \u2018too much\u2019.\n\nBut they\u2019re out of order- NTA", "NTA but your husband sure is  \ntell him to grow a spine and stand up to his mother being an absolute asshat", "don't forget to add on a few dress sizes for her", "I'm pissed at new husband staying out of it. It is HIS MOM!", "exactly! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am underweight due to stress (can not eat when stressed and my job makes me stressed like 24/7) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hate how many people comment on how \"great\" i look. I do not. I am 5kilograms underweight for my height and am doing terribly. Skinny is not automatically healthy", "It really isn\u2019t. I\u2019m coming at this from a male perspective, but I\u2019m someone who is perhaps quite a bit less vain than the average person (I believe we all have a bit of vanity in us to some degree so I\u2019m not meaning to be derogatory). I don\u2019t feel jealous if people look better than me (most of the time they probably do) but I do get very frustrated if they delay me or refuse to take part in something because it might affect their appearance in a minor way. Not talking disfigurement here, just hair messing up etc.\n\nEveryone assumes that less groomed/stylish looking/ un fashion conscious people are unhappy or confused or mentally unwell, or that people who are overweight long to be skinny.", "If you're planning kids... Please keep these women away from any daughters you might have", "So you're chubby sister's doctor? You know chubby sister personally? No? Then you can't know chubby sister is unhealthy.", "Omg i died at the end. The crying had me gagging lmmfao!! I may or may not have peed a lil watching that one, and now i have to binge south park.", "Omg i died at the end. The crying had me gagging lmmfao!! I may or may not have peed a lil watching that one, and now i have to binge south park.", "No way. Medusa was actually the person wronged, so that doesn't fit.", "This is the way.", " Patty Batch here, do you have a pen? Where do i sign?", "Ah, you right. I take it back"]}
