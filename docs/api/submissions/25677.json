Clearly, Mason's experience with your son does not bear out that accusation). She would be better served finding kids of the same maturity level and interests as Mason rather than pushing him onto kids who are in a different place.

It would be wrong to force your son to be friends. How would you feel if you were forced to friend someone you had no interest in.  It is correct that Mason is not your sons responsibility.

Your son isn't Mason's emotional support animal. He's a person who gets to decide how he wants to spend his time.", "NTA, kids mature at different points in life.

As everyone has said, he\u2019s allowed to have certain likes and dislikes at this age and he\u2019s figured out who he gels with. I have a 4 yr old who expresses certain preferences as well. The key here is that I try my 4 yr old out with a lot of new friends, in a very directed parenting manner, to see who fits. I even do that with my 6 yr old. I think by age 11, I\u2019d probably be letting my son do that on his own, UNLESS - and here is where I think there could have been no Asses in your story - unless we had moved to a brand new community and my son didn\u2019t know anyone. \n\nThen, I - like the neighbor mom - would try to set up play dates with a bunch of different types of kids to see who fit best. \n\nWhat I wouldn\u2019t do, and what the neighbor mom did, was lash out at brand new families and a next door neighbor to boot, and call them names. She has set herself up for a really awkward community. Hopefully howver, her son kind find his people. \n\nYou might ask your son to think about some of the other boys in his classes (do they go to the same school?) and see if he can think of other like minded kids for the new boy to hang out with. \n\nIt\u2019ll be a major drag on this boy if his mom is a shit, and she sabotages his attempts at friendship a lot. It\u2019s not his fault he has her. So maybe at school he can find his crew. \n\nIf they don\u2019t go to the same school, then too bad I guess. Hopefully he can find a good crew on his own there. 11 is hard.", "When I was in highschool there was this girl, let's call her Joan, Joan didn't have many friends and often ate lunch alone. For 4 years, grades 9-12, the school councillor would call myself and 2 of my friends to her office maybe twice or 3 times a year and ask us if we would let Joan sit with us at lunch. Apparently, we were the nicest girls in the school to her - which was probably the only time anyone called my teen self nice. I would always complain and say no but the councillor wouldn't listen and Joan would end up sitting with us for a week before ending up eating lunch alone again. Like I said, this pattern continued for 4 years.\n\nI've had a long time (I'm now 41) to reflect on those days. I don't think I was being mean, but I do think I was being unkind. Being kind is underated. \n\nYou mentioned how adults don't hangout with ppl they don't like and I agree with you but most adults also don't take rejection to heart as much as children and have more means to enhance their social circle if they desire. I also think the most pleasant adults I know are the ones who are genuinely kind hearted. \n\nI wish I could go back and just let Joan sit with us on the cold concrete of the quad. She was a nice but lonely person and I wish I had been kinder to her. \n\nIf you son doesn't want to play with this boy, he doesn't want to play. However, maybe mention to him that sometimes just occasionally being kind can have it's own rewards. Just an occasional \"hey, let's ride our bikes for an hour\" can have a remarkable difference on a lonely child's life. \n\nAlso as a side note about Joan, turns out she was being abused by several male members of her family and was so afraid to shower at home she was showering at school.

But it's not your son's responsibility to be friend with anyone.", "I was the kid who was encouraged to hang out with the one who didn't have friends. Which meant I didn't have friends. The other kids weren't being forced to hang out with people they didn't like, so I had no one but the person I didn't have anything in common with and didn't like.\n\nI grew up unable to say no, unable to advocate for what I wanted and needed, unable to make decisions based on what I wanted and instead became a doormat people-pleaser. I was made to feel like I had to ignore my own feelings to spare the feelings of everyone else. I was not able to choose what I consented to.\n\nI'm now in my 40s and still can't just say no. I still can't bring myself to simply ask for something I want. I defer to whatever other people want in most scenarios.

You can't force your son to be fake in order to play with someone else. Tell that mom tough sh*t and keep searching.", "I agree. This is a NAH situation. The son shouldn't feel he has to be friends with Mason, but learning to build connections is a useful skill. \n\nI might have gone in the direction of suggesting trying to include Mason in a group activity to try and avoid awkwardness between him and OP's son. But there's no point in forcing it....", "I think the fact that Mason struggles making friends says it all.  Something he's doing is off-putting to other kids, and that is something Mason and his parents need to work on together, but it isn't your son's job to be friends with someone he doesn't like. \n\n If you force your son to be friends with him then your son will get resentful and could possibly start being mean/ bullying him to get out of hanging out with him.  I know because I have seen this happen many times.  There was a girl in my class growing up, who probably should have been in special needs classes - she was legally blind and rocked and moaned a lot - which as an adult I more understand what was going on, but as a kid no one explained and it seemed very sexual and super awkward to be next to her at the time.  The teachers constantly were pairing her up with the 'nice kids' trying to get someone else to take care of her/ be friends with her.  But if you were mean to her the teacher wouldn't force you to pair with her - so we were all pretty horrible to her in a kind of self defense.  I'm not proud of it but as an adult I can see we were all put into a bad situation. \n\nThe other thing is that if other kids are forced to befriend him, and somehow are nice enough to not take it out on him - then he still won't learn to socialize properly with kids his age and eventually his forced friends will get old enough their parents can't make them hang out and he will be way behind in developing the social skills he needs and not understand where all his friends went.   \n\nMy kid is four, he's gone through periods where he comes home from school upset no one wants to play with him.  So then at home we work on sharing and letting other kids come up with rules for games and how to play nicely with others.  I talk to his teachers and we work on social skills at home just like we work on the alphabet and counting. If I just strong armed other parents into play dates then my son won't be learning that he can't always be in charge of all the rules of a game.  Don't let this lady get in your head!", "These activities sound like generic things kids do. Is Mason not interested in riding a bike or playing ball? If Mason doesn\u2019t want to do these things then obviously their interests are different. It\u2019s good to encourage boundaries but it\u2019s also good to be friendly and kind.

There are lots of people in life it\u2019s important to be on good terms with even if you don\u2019t want to spend extra time with them, and that\u2019s a very common adult relationship that a lot of young adults haven\u2019t learned about when they reach the workforce and have annoying coworkers, etc. That is NOT exclusionary and in fact is a great place to start learning about treating people you may not like politely/respectfully.", "NTA. Adolescence is a hard time. It really really sucks when your kid is one of the kids that struggles socially but you\u2019re right, it isn\u2019t your sons responsibility. I have a hard time calling the other Mom an AH but she did cross the line. With what is posted here, you are not raising a mean kid.

(Obviously other people\u2019s behavior towards them can warrant changes to this.)\nFor instance, not hanging with Mason is fine. Telling everyone at school that you don\u2019t like Mason is not fine.", "I mean, you are in fact teaching him it's ok to exclude someone. That's objectively true, you admitted it. It's just up to you if you care or not. Your wife seems to care. I don't think you're an asshole, so I'll vote NTA. But this questioning whether or not he's excluding someone is so strange. Obviously he is excluding the kid. How is this even a question?", "NTA, and it sounds like you were gentle but honest. As Mason matures, the boys may find they have more in common and seek each other out again but forcing the issue would ruin the chace of a genuine friendship forming.", "Not being interested in forming a friendship with someone is not excluding them. It's simply having different interests and pursuing friends who share yours"]}
