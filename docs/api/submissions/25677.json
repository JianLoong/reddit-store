They have a son the same age as my son (currently 11) and I was so excited for my son to have someone new to play with. The neighbor boy, who we will call Mason, came over a few times before my son told me that he doesn't care for him. He said that him and Mason don't have that much in common and that he feels that Mason still has more 'childish' interests where my son has started to grow out of some of those things. In my mind this was no big deal - my son doesn't have to like everyone he comes across, so that was that. I no longer suggested he go see what Mason is doing when he's bored, nor did I invite the boy over. This was about a month ago when my son voiced this to me.\n\nOn Saturday, Mason's mother asked me and my wife why my son and Mason haven't hung out in awhile, as Mason really likes my son. I was honest and said that my son felt that they didn't have that much in common and wanted to play with his other friends. Maybe I should've fudged the truth a bit because his mom got upset and started talking about how Mason has struggled making friends and that he thought my son was a lot of fun to hang out with and then asked if we could encourage our son to spend time with him. I said that I'm sorry Mason is struggling, but that isn't my sons responsibility. His mom said that we are raising a mean boy and walked away.\n\nMy wife has taken her words to heart and has been wondering if we are raising our son to be mean and exclusionary to people he doesn't like. I said that we, as adults, don't hang out with people we don't like and don't have that much in common with, so why should our son? Our boy hasn't bullied the kid, there's just a difference in interests. I also feel that he is old enough to make decisions about his own friends, as he isn't a toddler anymore. My wife has had second thoughts about this decision and I just need some outside input.

(Which it sounds like you are.) This situation is a great primer in consent and personal boundaries for him, he doesn\u2019t have to be friends with someone if he doesn\u2019t want to be.", "NTA. Nothing breeds resentment in kids faster than making them hang out with ones they don't want to hang with, especially when your son has already done the mature thing and stated a specific and valid reason why not. Mason's mother needs to realize not only that other people's kids have feelings that need to be considered, but that her method of 'making' friends for her son is sure to result in a bully instead of a friend.", "NTA - Your son shouldn't have to spend time with someone who he has no interest in spending time with. The mom was out of line and what she said is simply not true.", "NTA. In a year or two, they may become friends as the neighbor boy matures. Parental intervention will only cause resentment. Imagine knowing the only reason someone is hanging out with you is because they were forced.", "NTA.. my mom used to make me play with kids who rly gave me the ick sometimes and I wish she had listened to me", "NTA. At all.", "NTA - Your son is not being mean, whatever she means by that.  Not everyone gets along with everyone else, that is just a fact of life.  Most times that is not meanness but just different interests and in children different maturity phases growing up.  As you said, you can't force your son to be friend only to be courteous and respectful.  And you have done that.", "NTA - but I think the reality is in the tone here. If your wife is worried about whether your son is an asshole, it might be helpful to look at your sons friends he does choose to spend time with. Who does he choose as friends and how do they play?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Your son's reasons were valid and well-stated, and should be respected. Neighbor sounds like a bully herself trying to force Mason on your son and calling him names when you won't cave (if he were a mean boy, why was she asking him to spend time with Mason? Clearly, Mason's experience with your son does not bear out that accusation). She would be better served finding kids of the same maturity level and interests as Mason rather than pushing him onto kids who are in a different place. But, wait, that would be more work for her than sending him next door.", "NTA - I love what you said to your wife.  \nIt\u2019s true why should kids be forced to play with someone they don\u2019t like when adults don\u2019t have too ?", "Nta. It would be wrong to force your son to be friends. How would you feel if you were forced to friend someone you had no interest in.  It is correct that Mason is not your sons responsibility. The neighbor needs to find out why Mason has problems and address the issue. She should not try to force your son to assume her responsibility.  She is Mason's parent.  Your son is just his neighbor.", "Throughout our lives, there will be people we pop with and people we don't.\n\nIt's just what happens. There's no blame involved. If your son isn't interested in knowing the neighbor boy, then there's nothing you should want to do about that, because trying to force him to spend time with someone he doesn't care about is\n\nWrong and\n\nFutile and\n\nWill harm your relationship with him.\n\nYou wife seems to be terrified of being judged by this pushy neighbor mother who attacks anyone who doesn't give her what she wants.\n\nYour family was not set on earth to please her, and your wife is wrong. She is letting a gimmee gimmee rule her. She needs to grow a spine and not cower when some stranger gets pushy.", "There is a simple test to see if you are AH. What would you do and think if the roles are reversed. If your son wants to be a friend and rejected, would you feel the same? Would you ask his mother to encourage her son or not?", "That's where my wife is torn up - she wonders if she might have the rose colored glasses on. Because Mason's mom didn't mention any bullying, I don't think it is that way. I'm also biased in that I don't think my son would do that, but I think most parents feel that way.", "My son is an athletic kid. When his friends are over they ride their bikes around, play basketball in the driveway, toss a football around, etc. He does have a friend that isn't athletic and that he does like to just sit around and play video games with. \n\nI haven't received any complaints from the school or from other parents of my kid being intentionally mean. That doesn't mean that he isn't, but I trust that my son isn't a mean kid. I trust my wife a lot too, and I can see why this upsets and concerns her.", "It seems to me that you\u2019re pretty aware of the situation and your potential biases. I think you\u2019ve done a very fair thing, and it might be worth talking with your son to make sure he understands that it\u2019s totally fine not to be someone\u2019s friend, as long as he isn\u2019t bullying or encouraging bullying or exclusion. As you said, we don\u2019t have to like or spend time with everyone \u201cjust because.\u201d I have told my daughters that they never have to be someone\u2019s friend, but they do always have to be kind.", "NTA. Your son isn't Mason's emotional support animal. He's a person who gets to decide how he wants to spend his time.", "NTA, kids mature at different points in life.  Most of all your son should not be forced to play in a manner that he has moved passed.  Some boys at this age still like to play with toy trucks in the sand box and others are building model trucks.  School will be starting soon and then the new kid will have chance to make friends at school.", "NTA. Kids mature at different rates. Just because they are the same age, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re at the same stage. I think it could be nice to include the neighbor boy if/when your son has parties. Maybe encourage Mason\u2019s mom to sign him up for the same sports teams so that your son can introduce him to more people. There\u2019s alternatives to your son having to spend 1:1 time with him that allow Mason to get to know more kids in the neighborhood/community.", "Nta.  You're right to not force your son to have a relationship with someone he doesn't share interests. You probably should have fudged the truth a bit because it sounds like the mom got butt hurt and took it personal (which she is in the wrong for). \n\nYour son is not bullying the boy. They just didn't hit it off. It happens. We don't always like everyone we meet, the important thing is to treat others with kindness and respect. Pursuing friendship is different. You want to be friends with people you have things in common with.", "Nta. \n\nKids are different, just because they're the same age and gender doesn't mean they'll get along.\n\nImagine if we did that with adults. \"We're both women and 30, why aren't you my best friend?!\"", "A child who doesn't choose to be friends with another child his not being mean, he's expressing a legitimate personal preference.  If your child were bullying Mason, or telling other children not to play with him, or excluding him from group activities in the park or at school, that would be mean.  But not wanting to hang out with a neighbor is completely acceptable kid behavior.\n\nYou kid gave Mason a chance, got to know him, and realized they had little in common.  Please don't take away his personal prerogatives.\n\nNTA\n\nP.S. You could of course tell your son that Mason really likes him and ask if there's any activity he might enjoy with Mason.  But if your son, upon reflection and without being pressured, says no, let him walk away.", "NTA. Your son is not in unavoidable group settings (e.g., school playgrounds, parties) where he is singling out and excluding Mason from the group. That would be mean and exclusionary. \n\nThis sounds like a different circumstance. Your son doesn\u2019t have to go out of his way and force himself to spend time with someone when he doesn\u2019t enjoy it. You can\u2019t force a friendship."]}
