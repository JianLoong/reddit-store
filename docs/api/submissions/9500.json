{"id": 9500, "submission_id": "10xgka1", "title": "AITA for no longer accepting calls from the previous owner of my house?", "selftext": "My BF and I bought our first home from an elderly couple in January of 2022. Initially, I kept in contact with one of them (lets call her Barb) in the event that we might receive some of their mail or something. Contact was very occasional and was always something along the lines of asking if I received a package of hers or that she wanted to mail us a key that she found that went to the lock on our shed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMonths after we moved in, around early October, we received some dining chairs in a box addressed to Barb. A day or two later, a repeat of the exact same shipment arrived. I attempted to contact Barb but my calls would not go through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later, I came home from work and my BF (who frequently gets home before me) told me that he was starting to feel guilty about the situation and asked me to follow him to our garage. Apparently, packages containing furniture and decor had been coming regularly for weeks and we now had a garage full of boxes that were not addressed to us. My boyfriend had been storing the boxes and assuming the shipments would stop, but they continued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe doubled down and try harder to contact Barb with the help of other neighbors. We finally got in touch with her and she explained that she had lost her phone and that was why I was unable to contact her for some time. I explained the situation to her, and she gave me permission to open some of the items so I could describe them to her. She then told me that she had not ordered any of the items.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt turns out that, prior to moving, Barb had a friend of hers help her order furniture for her new home as she can't see well and was having trouble navigating the furniture website. This friend used her own computer to order Barb's things as a favor. I immediately became concerned that Barb was being robbed, and I urged her to contact her bank first and then her friend second.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBarb let me know days later that the charges were not fraudulent, it was a simple case of forgetting to change the shipping address, and the friend wanted to set up a time to come pick up her furniture from me. I explained that myself and my BF work a lot and I wanted to set up a time when I wouldn't be home alone. I don't know this person and I couldn't lift half of the furniture by myself to move it anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI began receiving calls from Barb and her friend day and night asking me to find the time to let them collect the items. After a few weeks, my BF and I finally had a weekend off together. I messaged both Barb and her friend with a day and time and received no reply from either person. By the first of the year, still nothing. I began receiving calls again at the end of January, after we had already gotten rid of most of the items since we had not heard back. I have not been answering the calls. It has been over a year that we have lived here, and several months since we received the furniture.

I typically work every other weekend and my boyfriend works side jobs on the weekends that I help him with if I am off to help make ends meet. He had jobs scheduled and it would have been unprofessional to cancel.", "OP says in the post that she doesn't know the previous homeowner's friend and doesn't feel confident moving heavy furniture.", "For information purposes, I called them at least 10 times as well as messaged them. I did not ignore them for months. I waited 2 and a half weeks until my BF and I had a weekend off, and had told them I was going to wait until then. \n\nI did not accept the deliveries, they were made during the day when I was not home and did not require a signature. They were left under my car port.\n\nI had no address to bring them to even if I wanted to hand deliver them. The effort was made. They did not follow through.", "Sorry about that. I see it's in the OP. Yeah, you should tell them that you got rid of the furniture.", "Info: Where did it go? Did you return to sender, or sell it, or...?", "Returning it to sender would have cost us the shipping and handling to do so, for a number of very heavy items. We gave most of it away and threw out some small decor items. We did not sell anything, that would have felt wrong.", "OP didn't have to be there though. They could have come when only the BF was home.", "I may have just left them in the driveway and said \u2018come and get it\u2019 so you wouldn\u2019t have to lift furniture or even see the people", "Oh dear. You might find that you're legally liable for the value of what you gave away. You certainly would be if you live where I do. \n\nI sympathise that you didn't want to store these items, but the time to assert that was at the time of delivery, by refusing to accept them.", "Yes they told you they wanted the items. You made is next to impossible for them to pick them up. YTA and basically stole these items from a senior citizen. How awful of you!!", "You had the time to organize giving away the furniture, but no time for an elderly woman to pick up her furniture? Make it make sense. YTA", "Maybe the boyfriend didn't want to be alone with a stranger, either???? What if there's an accident and one of them is injured??? It's better to be safe than sorry - and a third set of hands is safer.", "I wasn't arguing, just trying to clarify the option referred to", "Yta and will likely be getting sued", "NTA - but it is called \"return to sender, address unknown...\"", "YTA\n\nYou and your boyfriend found plenty of time to arrange for other people to get this furniture, but only offered one time to the rightful owners.", "According to the FTC, if you received an item at your address that you did not order, you are under no obligation to return it or find whoever is was meant for. This is a federal law meant to protect people from scams that operate this way. NTA.", "I don't know how the law works in your area, but you might have screwed yourself there because you agreed to hold on to the items until a time they can pick it up, and it has been only a few months. So I hope you have checked with the local law to see what you can legally do.   \nI'm kind of on ESH fence.", "Can't wait to see the update when OP is sued \ud83d\ude02, and hate to say it but it's definitely worse off because the previous owner is a protected class (the elderly) love to see it", "YTA do you not know anyone besides your boyfriend, someone who could have come and been present when this poor elderly woman came to collect?\n\nYou worry about being unprofessional toward jobs, yet you treated this woman like shit. Yes her friend made a mistake that caused a physically large inconvenience for you, but you sat on your hands while she tried, desperately it sounds, to work with you, and then you LITERALLY GOT RID OF HER BELONGINGS when she didn't snap to immediately. The fucking gall.", "Did you sale the items?", "Could you just give them a key to pick up the stuff and then change the lock or something.  I feel for ya, at this point, I would just want out of all their mess.  After your resolve it, you should put up a sign saying only mail/deliveries to your name will be accepted at your address.  \n\nEdit to add: I mean they're older folks and I have empathy for them and don't think you're TA, but I hope you find a way to help them and then just be done.", "NTA", "NTA", "YTA when you got rid of all the stuff. There were other solutions here, including, as others have said: leaving it all outside on a planned day for them to come and get, scheduling it when just BF is home, allowing them to pay for return shipping, and many other things. Giving it all away was not a smart way to handle this. Definitely a legal liability concern now.", "NTA you tried to return it they basically ignored you. It is what it is the rest of the stuff that you have just tell her that you can drop it off on her front steps and basically tell her when you dropped it off other than that I would just leave it alone and tell her to stop harassing you. Anything else that gets sent to your house? Tell her that you were gonna send it back. And she needs to leave you alone.", "Are you implying she can just place the giant boxes next to her mailbox, and the regular postman will load it into his truck and take it back to the post office then ship it back to the manufacturer?\n\nThese were most likely delivered by a third party. They will not be back to accept, lol", "Not OP's responsibility to make herself available for someone who no longer lives there, the onus is on them to get their delivery information correct.  She has no obligation to them whatsoever.", "Also, elderly people have a lot of trouble understanding how technology generally works so often times you have to be really patient with them in order for them to get through. Getting rid of the furniture was not the right move, imo.", "Previous owners messed up by not updating their address, you went above and beyond to try to help them.  Once they moved, anything that came to your house was yours to do what you wanted.  You are not a storage facility so I think you were more than kind. NTA", "How is OP supposed to refuse to accept the delivery if they just drop it off when she's not home?"]}
