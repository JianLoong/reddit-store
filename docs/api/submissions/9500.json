Initially, I kept in contact with one of them (lets call her Barb) in the event that we might receive some of their mail or something.

A day or two later, a repeat of the exact same shipment arrived. I attempted to contact Barb but my calls would not go through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later, I came home from work and my BF (who frequently gets home before me) told me that he was starting to feel guilty about the situation and asked me to follow him to our garage. Apparently, packages containing furniture and decor had been coming regularly for weeks and we now had a garage full of boxes that were not addressed to us. My boyfriend had been storing the boxes and assuming the shipments would stop, but they continued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe doubled down and try harder to contact Barb with the help of other neighbors. We finally got in touch with her and she explained that she had lost her phone and that was why I was unable to contact her for some time. I explained the situation to her, and she gave me permission to open some of the items so I could describe them to her. She then told me that she had not ordered any of the items.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt turns out that, prior to moving, Barb had a friend of hers help her order furniture for her new home as she can't see well and was having trouble navigating the furniture website. This friend used her own computer to order Barb's things as a favor. I immediately became concerned that Barb was being robbed, and I urged her to contact her bank first and then her friend second.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBarb let me know days later that the charges were not fraudulent, it was a simple case of forgetting to change the shipping address, and the friend wanted to set up a time to come pick up her furniture from me. I explained that myself and my BF work a lot and I wanted to set up a time when I wouldn't be home alone. I don't know this person and I couldn't lift half of the furniture by myself to move it anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI began receiving calls from Barb and her friend day and night asking me to find the time to let them collect the items. After a few weeks, my BF and I finally had a weekend off together. I messaged both Barb and her friend with a day and time and received no reply from either person. By the first of the year, still nothing. I began receiving calls again at the end of January, after we had already gotten rid of most of the items since we had not heard back. I have not been answering the calls. It has been over a year that we have lived here, and several months since we received the furniture.

They could have come when only the BF was home.", "I may have just left them in the driveway and said \u2018come and get it\u2019 so you wouldn\u2019t have to lift furniture or even see the people", "Oh dear. You might find that you're legally liable for the value of what you gave away. You certainly would be if you live where I do. \n\nI sympathise that you didn't want to store these items, but the time to assert that was at the time of delivery, by refusing to accept them.", "Yes they told you they wanted the items. You made is next to impossible for them to pick them up. YTA and basically stole these items from a senior citizen.

This is a federal law meant to protect people from scams that operate this way.

The fucking gall.", "Did you sale the items?", "Could you just give them a key to pick up the stuff and then change the lock or something.  I feel for ya, at this point, I would just want out of all their mess.

You became an AH when you got rid of all the stuff. There were other solutions here, including, as others have said: leaving it all outside on a planned day for them to come and get, scheduling it when just BF is home, allowing them to pay for return shipping, and many other things. Giving it all away was not a smart way to handle this. Definitely a legal liability concern now.", "NTA you tried to return it they basically ignored you. It is what it is the rest of the stuff that you have just tell her that you can drop it off on her front steps and basically tell her when you dropped it off other than that I would just leave it alone and tell her to stop harassing you. Anything else that gets sent to your house? Tell her that you were gonna send it back. And she needs to leave you alone.", "Are you implying she can just place the giant boxes next to her mailbox, and the regular postman will load it into his truck and take it back to the post office then ship it back to the manufacturer?\n\nThese were most likely delivered by a third party. They will not be back to accept, lol", "Not OP's responsibility to make herself available for someone who no longer lives there, the onus is on them to get their delivery information correct.

Getting rid of the furniture was not the right move, imo.", "Previous owners messed up by not updating their address, you went above and beyond to try to help them.

You kept something for yourself", "YTA\nThis sounds suspicious. Why did your BF keep packages that don't belong to y'all? Why didn't you know about it? Why was he feeling guilty? Why show concern about her possibly being robbed by a friend but yet turn around and do almost that; after agreeing to an exchange? So many holes in this story. Questions Questions Questions", "Where did the items go? This is the part of the story that is missing.", "NTA\n\nI've had to deal with a similar situation. Depending on your local laws, that stuff might meet the legal standard for being abandoned. Should you speak with Barb and her friend again, tell them this and (especially if the time limit has already come and gone) if they don't come get it by X time, it's gone. \n\nBe sure to seek a legal consultation.", "ESH\nYes, she should have responded faster, but you also could have just arranged to put everything on your driveway and her friend could have picked it up without ever seeing you.", "Esh. You promised a date, they were waiting weeks & weeks yet you dont see why they are getting impatient?", "YTA and your BF is a total trash for taking the packages and making no effort to contact the owners.\n\nYou know they are elderly so only an AH would just \"get rid\" of their stuff.

The law still applies.", "So you made time for other people to pick things up but could not make time when Barb was calling you?  And kept the rug?", "Not with it being for someone who does not live there. You can call shipping companies and decline a delivery even after it was delivered. I don't know if there will be repercussions.", "They probably wanted to do the swap during daylight hours. I can understand not wanting to deal with people at 10 pm.", "No it doesn't. There's also a law about opening other people's packages. It's a felony. So you can't just keep whatever arrives to your house. \n\nI know in this situation OP had permission to open them but in general you can't just keep everything that arrives to your house without your name on it.", "No it does not \u2014 this was not unsolicited someone paid for it.", " It's a common scam.  A parcel is delivered to your house, you realize it's not for you and so don't open it. Shortly afterwards, someone knocks on your door and asks for it - apparently \"the sender got the address wrong\" etc. You hand it over.  It turns out the credit card use to purchase the item was fraudulent.\r  \n\r  \nWhen the sender has lost their money, the only address they have to come back to is yours. Now of course, you're not liable for the money owing, but depending on the amount, it may take some time to convince the sender/debt collector of that fact.\n\nThis is why the law exists.  It was delivered to his address with a name on it that does not live there.  He is under no obligation to find out whose it was.", "I agree you can't legally open other people's packages, but OP is also under no obligation to store them and arrange pick up. I guess she could've left the furniture on the pavement? - but then everyone would trip over it, and it's generally not great for parents with pushchairs and disabled people. And the outcome would've been the same - the council would likely have picked the stuff up after lots of complaints, and handed it over to a charity. \n\nI'd say N-T-A and former owners are AHs, but it's really difficult to blame the elderly lady for what was probably an honest mistake.\n\nI wouldn't go with Y-T-A either because OP doesn't need to be flexible with timing here, but the previous owner does (and she wasn't). Working a random shift pattern is a real thing and is exhausting by the way.\n\nSo I'll compromise and say ESH because the whole thing is just ridiculous.", "You never bring it inside and call the shipper to come get it.", "No that is not why the law exists \u2014 it has existed for decades because of scammy practices of book clubs, greeting card clubs etc.\n\nThe key part of the law is \u201cunordered merchandise\u201d  and the law is 39 USC 3009 \n\nThis was ordered merchandise.", "YTA. Your BF had kept all these packages without you even noticing, which implies you have more than enough space to hold onto them. You also expecting two elderly people to be available at the drop of a hat is quite a miss. Something is off here, you can't lift the furniture by yourself, then it didn't arrive ny post, you had to have accepted these deliveries. And then you kept a rug for yourself??? I don't understand how you can possibly think you're in the right here.", "Technically maybe you didn\u2019t but you kinda robbed those old people.", "Many places have a set procedure for disposing of items that aren't your own. Such as notifying people or placing an add in the paper usually with about 30 days to respond. Then you can sell the items to recoup your costs and the rest of the money goes to the owner. \n\nI think you shouldn't have got rid of the items in the way you did. \n\nThe final action should have been a call or letter saying they have 30 days to collect the items and they can be collected on maybe 3 or 4 seperate dates or times and at the end of the 30 days they will be sold or disposed of. You don't have to keep calling but I do think you needed to give a fair timeframe for them pick up.", "YTA you should have contacted the shipping company or seller and have them arranged to pick the packages, most of them would have done it for free or would have the buyer pay for it.", "Call the company and say you have furniture delivered to someone who no longer lives there. They\u2019ll likely come get it or send a company to.", "YTA", "If immediately is waiting 3 months while trying to contact both the previous owner and her non-elderly friend, then yes, I did that.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou knew who the items were for, that they wanted them urgently, they tried to arrange a time to collect them multiple times - you did not oblige & then got rid of their things when they couldn't make your last minute window?\n\nI hope they sue you.", "YTA why didn\u2019t you just return the packages? Seems weird to hoard them.", "YTA...they could potentially come after you for getting rid of the stuff they bought. Its hard for older ppl to deal with technology and it was an accident. My aunt loses her phone all the time. Y'all could have put it in the driveway with a tarp on it and had them come get it. I'm sure you have a camera that could of watched them. I get not wanting ppl you don't know at your home...I had an issue with the lady I bought mine from...but sometimes you need to just be a decent human.", "That law is for unsolicited items addressed to the recipient.", "Did we read the same thing?

Anything could have happened to necessitate thay gap, a death, an illness, an injury, anything at all. \n\nAnd it's not \"ill wishes\" to hope that someone who paid for something, is compensated for items they paid for & did not receive, due to your actions. \n\nStop ignoring them, grow up & own up to what you've done. They deserve an explanation & you're in the wrong here.", "Throwing away newly bought stuff didn\u2018t feel wrong?? And Who picked the other stuff up? Didn\u2018t both of you have to be at home for that as well?", "Understood, I just really don\u2019t want people I do not know coming to my house when I am not home or I am home alone. Contrary to what everyone has assumed, the previous owners of the home were elderly but the friend who ordered the furniture was not.", "I waited 3 months and had received no contact from Barb, nor her (non-elderly) friend despite my attempts to call them, as I had NO ADDRESS to send either of them a letter.", "The packages were just left there. OP didnt accept them", "It did but I needed to free up some storage space after 3 months of no contact from any of the individuals involved. And yes, we were both home, it\u2019s not like it was the following weekend.", "I'd add the timeline to your post as for me it changes things. If you waited another 3 months after that weekend before giving away the first item, and they didn't respond to your messages/calls or get in touch with you in that time, then NTA. \n\nI think the only other thing I would've done in your position was send them a warning message and voicemail saying that they have until X date before you start removing the items from your home. Realistically there's only so much you can do, and it was essentially a pile of inconvenient junk in your garage that you were forced to take responsibility for. \n\n(Legally I'm not sure where you stand, IANAL, but hopefully you're in the clear.)", "How did the stuff end up in the garage if it was so increadibly heavy and two people couldn\u2018t lift it? Also if it\u2018s so scary to be alone with a stranger who already knows where you live anyway, why not call a friend over or something. Idk I feel like there could have been a better solution than getting rid of the stuff", "You could have told them again that you were going to do that", "Yes, I should have left them all voicemails.", "OP did not order it.  Therefore \"unordered merchandise\" delivered to his address.", "Misinterpreting a law on purpose does not make you correct.", "About 10 years ago my mom ordered an item online. She mis-typed the address and it was sent to the wrong house. We contacted the owners of house and they told us to pound sand. We consulted a lawyer about our options and he told us there was nothing we could do since the law protected them. This situation is no different."]}
