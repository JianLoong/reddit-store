You are disabled. End of fucking story. There is no \"does this person need it more\", imo- you are disabled. Those seats are there for YOU.

In simple conversations like that, it's all too easy to forget to say the thing that might've defused things, let alone the fact that you're still entitled to medical privacy.

This isn\u2019t a \u201ccripp\u2019 off\u201d competition to see who\u2019s more disabled. You literally can\u2019t stand that long and it would be worse and more dangerous to pass out on the train. I fractured my lower back and need the handicap bathroom to sit down and get back up safely. Gotta hoist myself up. Something similar happened as I was trying to go and another woman came in asking for the bathroom. I\u2019m already in there trying to go and she\u2019s trying to make it sound like a competition of who has it worse while I\u2019m trying to go. And I\u2019m having trouble going because she won\u2019t stop talking. There is only one bathroom and I was in there first using it even if we both need it.

I'm sorry if you are biased towards elevating autism over other invisible disorders as a matter of principle, but I don't see it the same way.

The internalized ableism that occurs because people frequently attack those who are young and have invisible disabilities points more to intense denial than fake story. \n\nIf everyone says you're lying, a faker, over exaggerating your symptoms, for years, you tend to believe them and feel guilty over your actions.

I myself am on the spectrum. I am not self loathing. I do hate autistic people who are so entitled that they think their invisible disability trumps the invisible disabilities of people who are not autistic but have disabilities that affect them more drastically. I will continue to call them out. I have a family member with POTS. I know how they suffer in day to day activities at home, let alone in public. I would absolutely rain hell on any self-entitled autistic person who thought they deserve a seat over a person with POTS. Just because I am on the spectrum doesn't mean I am immune to noticing the entitlement of other autistic people."]}
