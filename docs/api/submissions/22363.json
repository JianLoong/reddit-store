For her to say they've done stuff before but it didn't work makes me think that she still wants it to work with him if she keeps hanging around with him. You need to tell her that you're thinking of leaving and see what she says. If she doesn't agree to cut him off outside of work then you know how she feels. Protect yourself.

It's her who cheated on you and it's you who asks us if you're an asshole because you don't want your wife to go out with this guy?  Just to be clear (if not) your feelings are totally valid regarding this story.\n\nYou have every right not to want your wife to be around this guy, especially after what's not in between.  I'm sorry but your wife doesn't care how you feel and will continue to see her colleague with or without your consent.  \n\nYour only way out in my opinion is to separate from your wife for good she is totally self centered and only looks and takes what suits her apparently being friends (or ++) with this guy is her only priority  despite your disagreement.  Dude takes over the reins of your life and doesn't let your wife lie to you, control you, play with your feelings and your sanity.\n\nI hope you can make the right decision.", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry but you need to leave her.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't respect you or your marriage. After hurting you in this way, I can't understand why she would even want to have optional interactions with him. The fact that she said she tried things with him and it didn't work out and can't see him as more than a friend unfortunately says a lot about how she feels about you and your marriage. Sorry OP", "YTA for not having any self respect. Neither you or your wife seem to respect you. It's time to pay attention to the red lights and leave her.", "Just leave her already.. NTA", "Let her go man asap she doesn't respect you", "She has cheated on you and is not remorseful. She is what you would call entitled. She is very controlling and tbh walking all over you, I can\u2019t believe you even feel bad about asking her to stay away from him/them. Cheating is disrespectful and it can make the other person feel like they are not enough. I think your self-esteem has been affected. I don\u2019t believe this is a good woman for you. If you stay with her, this is going to be your life, is this the life you want? You deserve better mate.", "NTA, I\u2019d be absolutely ropable in that situation. What blatant disrespect on her part. Think seriously about whether this relationship is worth continuing.", "NTA. Lawyer up OP, I'm sorry.", "Bro...", "NTA\n\nBut if you think they've stopped the physical intimacy, I've got a bridge to sell you.  Not to be too blunt, but she's cheating on you. Wake up.", "NTA\nLeave her.  She\u2019s not actually sorry and it will only lead to her lying about spending time with him.  \nAlso what she did is unforgivable to me as it was deliberate and as you stated in a date setting. \nTell her she can continue to see him cause you\u2019re done.

Will hurt you for a while but you\u2019ll be happier in the long run.", "NTA and you should start very quietly getting your financial affairs in order to protect yourself from what\u2019s coming or is already happening without your knowledge. She def doesn\u2019t love you or respect you. You need a Plan B stat. Sorry. You deserve much better.", "Bro, some dude fucked your wife\u2019s mouth, all you did was ask her not to hang out with him, and she refuses. Am I missing something, leave her trashy ass and find someone who actually cares for you. NTA", "YTA", "NTA. However, you are being an asshole to yourself for staying in this relationship. This has to be fake, honestly. She basically told you the only reason why she isn't still cheating on you is because it didn't \"work out\", and then is still going to spend time with the guy, and you really have to  ask if you're the asshole? C'mon, dude. I say this with love, but have some self-respect and leave her. Get into therapy and work on building self-esteem. You certainly don't deserve this, but at this point, you're allowing it to happen.", "Leave her ass", "NTA.\n\nBut I agree. She's using OP as safety net while she dates the other guy. I wonder if the \"third\" guy will be there whole time or they conveniently leave the golfing trip early.\n\nShe is over the relationship at this point and it's painfully obvious.", "Exactly, truth is you can't hold someone that doesn't want to be held & once someone has broken your trust it's damn hard to fix that. By going out with him even though she knows it's upsetting you, she is clearly not interested in your feelings or need to feel secure in your relationship. I honestly don't see a way back to good with that sort of attitude.\n\nIf you think you have something worth saving, I recommend going to marriage counseling. But the person is only a counselor, not a miracle worker, don't expect them to turn rotten fruit into fresh.\n\nNTA", "He deserves soo much better!! The audacity to have him forgive her and then try to be friends with the other guy!!!", "This, she\u2019s upset you\u2019re bothered?\n\nDude, unless you\u2019re both open minded that casual oral sex is just a bit of experimenting\u2026idk how you\u2019d not be bothered by cheating in your marriage.\n\nShe\u2019s not only unremorseful, she genuinely has no issue with seeing you hurt and continuing to hurt you.\n\nI\u2019m a female with male friends I will not lose because of relationships. I do proactively cut off any friends with benefits before I commit to a bf. She\u2019s full of BS if she tries selling this behavior as ok. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, I\u2019m not one to jump the gun but I\u2019d suggest you keep your eyes WIDE OPEN! (And your heart safe.) I think you got narcissistic traits showing in your wife that can easily have you fooled into thinking you\u2019re the issue. Idk if this is her personality, but I\u2019m concerned for you that it is traits (which many of us have, the disorder is rare though), and you may end up emotionally bruised. It\u2019s good you got an outside perspective now, just be weary and know you gotta loook out for you here (that marital team has been disbanded, it\u2019s each person for themself until y\u2019all get counseling or something to mend this).", "And she says it so casually. It's okay because the guy wasn't good. So OP is safe from this one guy but it she finds someone she does connect with she'll do it again", "This!", "And she hasn't stopped doing \"things\" with him\n\nShe doesn't love OP, she loves his paycheck", "This is so strange. She literally told him she tried him out and wasn\u2019t that into it so she still wants to be with him. Like what?! It reminds me of a boy in college that dumped me for someone else and then when they didn\u2019t want him he wanted to get back together with me. Boy (or in this case girl) bye.", ">You are.allowed to set boundaries.\n\nTo be clear, boundaries don't include controlling other people. Boundaries are for OP to set for himself. OP needs to set a boundary that doesn't include getting walked all over by, probably, divorcing his wife.", "This sub is often way too quick to jump to the conclusion of leave them... But in this instance it's correct. He should have left a while ago", "Lmao \u201csexual mouth stuff\u201d is the funniest shit I\u2019ve read all day.

Some genuinely regret it, feel horrible and will do everything to be forgiven, but the rest sees forgiveness as a permission to go on cheating. It's not hard to see where OP's wife fits in. She's barely bothering to hide her intent now.", "To be clear, you can absolutely set a boundary to control the behaviour of other people, especially in situations like this, but it only works if they allow it by doing as you tell them. If they don't respect you enough to listen and do as you say, or don't care about your boundary, it doesn't work, and then you're forced to act.\n\nThe actual boundary isn't the act of control, however; it's how you react when they do something that crosses the line. In this case, that would most commonly be initiating a divorce.\n\nThink of boundaries as conditions for a continued relationship. You can set conditions all you like, and those conditions can be restrictive on the other party, but they have to wilfully accept and adhere to them.", "Thank you for your service\ud83e\udee1", "*a massive*", "Yeah it's time to lawyer up and shut those emotions off pal", "Me too, and I second this.

I wish I had done that because sure enough 6 months after filing for divorce she came back asking to get back together, her and BJ were done (they really were as time would tell) but I told her no, the damage was too severe, the divorce too ugly.\n\nGood luck and be good to yourself, you deserve better.", "Ikr?\n\n\"I cheated, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would, so it doesn't count... we'll see how the next guy measures up.\"", "That got me.

The comment before assumed its money, gender stereotypes (women are in it for love or golddiggers)\u2026many angry people will have their mind go there to discredit/insult women. No need to go there.
