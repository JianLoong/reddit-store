In the beginning she tried to hide it and then after a few months she didn\u2019t care and would break up with me and come back whenever she wanted. She did some other pretty horrible things. It still kinda haunts me. Reading your post gave me chills and brought me back to that time, she was very dismissive the way your described it. She almost made it my fault without exactly doing that, it\u2019s hard to explain though.\n\nCouples therapy, have a big sit down conversation that she\u2019s knows is serious, if you feel it\u2019s necessary I would definitely leave.

One of the first signs a cheater is remorseful is the cut off the AP and block all avenues of communication.

My sense is that she cares more about spending time with this person than her relationship with you. Probably because she still is interested in pursuing a relationship with this person.\n\nYou did a decent thing forgiving her when she admitted her mistake. But now she is not demonstrating remorse. If she was truly sorry and invested in your marriage she would stay clear of that guy and maybe even be looking for a new job and other ways to strengthen trust between you.", "NTA at this point.

Cheaters do not deserve to be able to get away with what they did. You may have forgiven her and decided to work on the marriage, but you have not forgotten, and she doesn\u2019t deserve to have it forgotten.\n\nSo make sure her family knows she cheated on you. Make sure all mutual friends know that she cheated on you.\n\nHer family and friends deserve the right to decide how they interact with her (if they want to at all afterwards)", "NTA  She obviously doesn't care how you feel.  She didn't care when she cheated on you and she doesn't care now. It sounds more like she is enjoying watching you squirm with jealousy.

That usually is the only way for the betrayed partner to work forward. Her wanting to stay friends with the person they had an affair with is honestly just a deeply selfish/self serving choice. She doesn't get to say you need to get over it if she truly wants to fix your relationship and rebuild a relationship based on respect and commitment.\n\nHer stating that *she doesn't want to be limited* is incredibly selfish and dismissive of you. She's stating that despite betraying you, throwing out the relationship you'd thought you had to have a fling, she's **still** prioritizing her own wants instead of realizing the hurt and damage she caused you and stopping it, and working towards healing.\n\nI'd suggest you get into counseling for yourself, and possibly marriage counseling so you can decide if she is dedicated in fixing the problems and if you actually want to have a relationship with someone that can't see how they need to make radical changes to their own character in order to have a chance of healing your relationship.", "op stayed so he forgave the infidelity.
