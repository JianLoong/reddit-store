She doesn't get to say you need to get over it if she truly wants to fix your relationship and rebuild a relationship based on respect and commitment.\n\nHer stating that *she doesn't want to be limited* is incredibly selfish and dismissive of you.

For her to say they've done stuff before but it didn't work makes me think that she still wants it to work with him if she keeps hanging around with him. You need to tell her that you're thinking of leaving and see what she says. If she doesn't agree to cut him off outside of work then you know how she feels. Protect yourself.
