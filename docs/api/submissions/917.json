He was only released last October (2021) after yet another stint inside. That\u2019s not the only reason I cut him out of my life though. He was always so abusive towards me even when we were little, verbally and physically. The straw that broke the camels back was him getting locked up for the 2nd time shortly before our mother was diagnosed with then died of lung cancer. I was already so angry at him for so many things but realising my mother never got to say goodbye to all 3 of her children because one was such a selfish ahole had me snapping him out of my life forever. I fully understand you wanting and needing to have boundaries, especially when dealing with a family member who is a career criminal. You don\u2019t need that kind of drama around yourself or your children. You cannot take the chance he might bring something into your home which could be super dangerous or have the kind of people he might be hanging around with in your home. Career criminals always go back to the things they got busted for. If he brings something into your home and it\u2019s found by law enforcement, it\u2019s really hard to prove you as the homeowner didn\u2019t know it was there.
