You didn't expect things to get locked down that extremely and we're only trying to protect her. However, it sounds like you just mentioned to her parents about being cautious long before this situation, and most level headed parents would appreciate to have been told about what you found and wanted to take things into their own hands. \n\nShe's still a kid, so she might have done this even after having talks with her parents about internet security. You should've went to her parents first and showed them what you saw and explain how having links to other profiles is also dangerous. You didn't bring the parents in on this decision so you already didn't do anything to help this situation, her parents will likely just feel sorry for her and help her get a new profile, not knowing that it wasn't just a glitch.\n\nI've worked in the it department for awhile, so I definately agree with not sharing personal information. That being said, you need to educate the user otherwise it just keeps happening. Tbh, I would be pretty pissed if my brother found my child's account and didn't bring it up to me so that I could handle it. I hid lots of crap from my parents, it's alot easier with non tech parents. Now niece knows that she just has to make an account and lie about her age without understanding why the decision to block her account was made.\n\nI'm not trying to shit on you, that's why I don't think you're the AH.
