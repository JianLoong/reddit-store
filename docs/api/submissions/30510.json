You didn't expect things to get locked down that extremely and we're only trying to protect her. However, it sounds like you just mentioned to her parents about being cautious long before this situation, and most level headed parents would appreciate to have been told about what you found and wanted to take things into their own hands. \n\nShe's still a kid, so she might have done this even after having talks with her parents about internet security. You should've went to her parents first and showed them what you saw and explain how having links to other profiles is also dangerous. You didn't bring the parents in on this decision so you already didn't do anything to help this situation, her parents will likely just feel sorry for her and help her get a new profile, not knowing that it wasn't just a glitch.\n\nI've worked in the it department for awhile, so I definately agree with not sharing personal information. That being said, you need to educate the user otherwise it just keeps happening. Tbh, I would be pretty pissed if my brother found my child's account and didn't bring it up to me so that I could handle it. I hid lots of crap from my parents, it's alot easier with non tech parents.

It was the social media sites who ban children under 13 from joining.", "NTA. Honestly I would tell them she probably got banned for being underage for the apps but you will look into it.

I understand you tried to talk with mom about your nieces online presence. You didn\u2019t like how your sister responded so you decided to get all her accounts blocked.

It's very possible that your sister doesn't really get it, and realize how much of her personal information was easily accessible and how that could be dangerous for her. I just think that what you should have done instead was show your sister all of that information and then sit her down and break it down to her, to explain how this can be dangerous to her and what predators can do with that information. And to do the same with your niece, for the same reason. It would have been a chance to open their eyes and educate them both. But instead you chose to act without doing that, and completely lose the opportunity of what could have been a very important teachable moment for them both. And now you can't do that.
