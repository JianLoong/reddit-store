My boss and his family all used an app that shared their locations with each other. This way his kids didn't have to check in with them, he could look and see that they were at school for some activity, at a friend's house, etc. Stuff that when I was young I would have had to tell my parents in advance of or call and get permission to do. Also one of his daughters rode a motorcycle and if she was out of touch for a while he could check and see if she was still moving then he knew she was fine. In exchange for this they had a lot of freedoms many kids don't have.", "Huh, I didn\u2019t know that. Thanks!"]}
