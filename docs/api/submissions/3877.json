Your mom needs a hobby", "NTA. Good lord. You\u2019re 26. \n\nThose apron strings are amazingly long. Damn.", "NTA holy crap. You\u2019re 26. Do not ever let her do this. \n\nYou\u2019re not being unfair to her. What is unfair is her pressuring her adult children to let her spy on them.", "NTA I would also tell her to stop asking", "Emphatically NTA.  Unless there is a very good and specific reason, asking to track someone else in real time is controlling behavior.\n\nI keep location services turned off on my phone and have never even been asked, let alone agreed, to allow another person to track me in real time.  However, when I am on the road, I have undertaken to phone home or send an email every so often (generally once every few days) so that close family knows I am not in distress.\n\nGuard your autonomy.", "NTA.  Definitely.  Your mom needs to let her adult children be adults.", "NTA.  You're an adult and can go where you want.  Do not open this can of worms, do not let her add you to that tracker.  You'll never have another moment's peace.", "NTA She has no reason to do this.", "NTA. You're old enough to be entitled to your own privacy and not being tracked as if you are still a teenager.", "Yikes. NTA. Mom needs to understand that even though you\u2019re HER child, you\u2019re not A child. Unless she pays your bills or there\u2019s some actual safety reason for her to track you, it\u2019s a NOPE. Mom needs to cut the apron strings.", "NTA - Continue to say no. It is unfair for her to ask. You are an adult. Her tracking and fixation of your sisters location is weird & not necessary. Your mom needs a hobby and/or more meaningful focuses in her life. Best to you.", "NTA your mom needs to learn boundaries this is not normal. I mean is there some kind trauma causing this or is she just that nosy?", "NTA. Your mom needs to take a step back and let you and your sister lead your own lives! Good on you for sticking to your guns.", "NTA. I\u2019m 29f and my parents and I share locations. We do it because they are retired and like to travel so I can find them (hopefully) quickly if something happens. My husband and I like to travel too and it gives them a peace of mind if they don\u2019t hear from me or him they could find us. \n\nThat being said, it takes a lot of trust and respect for that to be possible in our family. Your mom seems to me like she still wants to be in control and well, you don\u2019t want or need her too. Just keep saying no and be firm in your boundaries.", "NTA, talk about a helicopter mom", "NTA\n\nSounds like mom needs to get a social life of her own. \n\nYou're not a kid anymore.

This is just really an odd request for a parent to make of an adult child.", "You have got to put a stop to this over-parenting NOW or else you will always be infantilized.  At 26, it's none of her business where you go.  And if it's due to worrying that you're going to get murdered, remind her that you do just fine in your everyday life and she'll just have to manage her anxiety because that's her problem, not yours.  I had to do this with my own over-anxious parents because their worry was hindering my hard-fought autonomy as an independent adult, which I didn't manage to wrestle away until I was in my mid-30's.", "NTA\n\nYour mom needs professional help.\nThis is not healthy for anyone in the family.", "NTA. Why would you even ask?", "Good god OP, you are 100% there is no way in hell your mother needs to know where you are 24/7. You will instantly regret giving her location access the day you do that.", "NTA", "No, no NTA and you're not in the wrong. It's weird to ask to track the location of your adult children on their phones.

Just say No and grey rock her.", "NTA\n\nIt's weird. It's certainly not a fairness issue.", "NTA, everyone has the right to privacy. Definitely an adult. I can't think of any excuse when tracking someone else's location is a good idea.\nUnless the other person is (early) demented or has an intellectual disability.", "NTA. You're an adult and you have every right to make this decision. Perhaps talk to your mom about why she feels the need for it? Perhaps find a way to put her at ease (for instance if she knows you were out, letting her know you're home safe and sound). \n\nThis does make me so happy I grew up in a time where this wasn't really a thing. Like you, I would not have wanted to be tracked. Still don't.", "Nope, NTA.\n\nYour mother's behavior feels creepy to you, and that's enough of a reason to say no.

She shouldn't treat you nor your sister like you are. NTA for enforcing your boundaries.", "NTA Posts like this make me really glad my mom is electronically inept.", "NTA. Your mom is probably coming from a place of stress over your safety and I can empathize with that but as an adult you need to set boundaries. Try to see if there is anything else you could do to let her know that you are safe and ease her worries. It might still end up with her insisting this is the only way but at least you can say that you tried. Either way, you\u2019re Nta for sticking to your boundaries", "NTA. I have a 16-year-old that does not want to be tracked. I try to respect her privacy and let her turn it off (but I do make her turn it back on if I feel like she\u2019s abusing my trust).

They moved across the country, and it made us feel connected/ someone would know if we were dead in a ditch (emergency precaution if we  couldn't be contacted for days-weeks). I don't share that information with parents despite frequent inquiries. It comes down to trust and/or utility. I know my sibling wouldn't even look unless something serious came up, and they wouldn't misuse the information or spread it. You aren't comfortable with your mom having access to that information because she would use it to spy (good intentions or not).
