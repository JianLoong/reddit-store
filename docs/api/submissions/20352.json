If he did go for drinks first, would he come over buzzed?", "NTA - I don't know how long you've been dating, but he is clearly telling you where your importance lays with him. It is more important to him to have room for potential plans that it is to have guaranteed plans with you. Again he would rather have room for a maybe than to have something set with you.

They'll always prioritize the entire world before they prioritize you.", "You are NTA, but you'll be doing yourself and your self-respect a massive disservice if you continue to date this man for one moment longer.\n\nAny person who is in an exclusive relationship with you and is comfortable saying to your face: \"I would rather not make dinner date plans with you at all than prioritise you over PLANS I DO NOT HAVE to 'have a beer with the guys from work' that may or may not coalesce at some point but which even in their non-existence are more important than you are\" . . . \n\n. . . put as gently as possible, I think it's pretty clear that person does not give a flying f\\*\\*k at a rolling doughnut about you, as the late, great Kurt Vonnegut would have said.", "NTA, but you are only an option to this man. Hope you see that before it's too late.", "NTA but is it possible that there have been discussed plans of beer drinking just nothing solidified? Because technically until you suggested a time for dinner the same could be said of the dinner plans. However you commented that you expect this extra hour to extend to 1.5 or 2 hours which seems to me that you have experience with him juggling two sets of plans in the same night. Some can do this with ease but others, most maybe, are likely to get caught up in first activity and be late for second activity which I suspect is what you meant here and this would bother me as well. You said you felt de-prioritized and honestly I think that is accurate so take the knowledge of your priority in his life to heart and see if you can continue on with that knowledge.", "NTA\n\nPlease reevaluate this relationship.\n\nHe is keeping himself open to the possibility of drinking with his friends over concrete plans of having dinner with you.

My wife and I agree that normal is between 7:30 and 8:30 pm, but we have friends and relatives who would consider that late, and a few who would consider 7:30 to be early.

Your boyfriend either isn't making you a priority or he has a drinking problem neither of which is good. Time to take a step back.

It's fair to expect some flexibility around plans, regardless of reason.\n\n>AITA for not wanting the move the dinner for potential plans?\n\nNo. It's completely valid of you to feel that his reasoning is stupid (I also think it's stupid). \n\nYou guys are just dating. This just demonstrates an incompatibility between you two.", "This is another \"Reddit Yikes\" thread.\n\n>He accepted the invitation, and we messaged back and forth about the details and eventually got to the question of when.\n\nSo spur of the moment, cool beans.\n\n>I suggested a normal dinner hour and he asked for a late dinner hour (an hour later).

You gave him a choice of time, you didn't plan the meal to be at a hard and fast time. So I don't see why you're upset.\nIf you wanted him there at 7 [random time], you should have invited him for dinner AT 7, instead of leaving it open.\n\nReddit needs to calm down with this red flag BS, ain't no flags.", "ESH because neither could comprise just 30 minutes on each end.
