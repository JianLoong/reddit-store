It is more important to him to have room for potential plans that it is to have guaranteed plans with you. Again he would rather have room for a maybe than to have something set with you.

Hope you see that before it's too late.", "NTA but is it possible that there have been discussed plans of beer drinking just nothing solidified? Because technically until you suggested a time for dinner the same could be said of the dinner plans. However you commented that you expect this extra hour to extend to 1.5 or 2 hours which seems to me that you have experience with him juggling two sets of plans in the same night. Some can do this with ease but others, most maybe, are likely to get caught up in first activity and be late for second activity which I suspect is what you meant here and this would bother me as well. You said you felt de-prioritized and honestly I think that is accurate so take the knowledge of your priority in his life to heart and see if you can continue on with that knowledge.", "NTA\n\nPlease reevaluate this relationship.\n\nHe is keeping himself open to the possibility of drinking with his friends over concrete plans of having dinner with you.

You gave him a choice of time, you didn't plan the meal to be at a hard and fast time.
