At a restaurant where you are just there for the dinner okay that\u2019s not *that* late. But coming to your date\u2019s house for dinner is hopefully also a social event. I presume he\u2019s not just there to eat. \n\nAnd my OP literally said I felt down prioritised for the *potential* of other plans, so please don\u2019t say was I not confident to make that clear. Had he already made actual plans I would have understood", "Alrighty", "[removed]", "You're making this all about the time for dinner not being fully expressed and ignoring the main issue, which is that he's prioritizing the *possibility* of drinking with mates after work over concrete plans of having dinner with OP.  NTA, OP! Not a keeper.", "Sorry I was replying to the above comment coming from the perspective that it doesn't matter either way what time dinner was because the issue was about him not prioritising you. It came across that it was being left out on purpose but you've clarified that it was to avoid cultural bias so fair enough.\n\nWhen I said you weren't feeling confident in being upset about the priority  I didn't so much mean omitting the information from your post here. I just mean like in general? Whether it was a reasonable time or not is kind of irrelevant, it was a really shitty thing for him to downgrade you to something he'll do later on for plans he doesn't even have yet. I thought maybe you were using the timing issue to add validity to your grievance? I was saying that you don't need to add anything to it and maybe you just don't feel confident telling him he's being a dick so you were looking for a good enough reason rather than just telling him that it was supposed to be a nice thing and not just something he shows up when he feels like it after going out drinking.\n\nEither way NTA", "Bot alert. bad bot!\n\nCopied from here https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gi2kw/-/jp6upty"]}
