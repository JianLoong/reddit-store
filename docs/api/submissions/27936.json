Just click on my user name and you will see it\n\nI have a child in second grade. The rules of the school is that if you hand out invites on school grounds everyone needs to be invited. So I instead sent the invites in the mail to basically the whole class but one kid.\n\nThe reason is the mother and father are a nightmare. Their son is fine, but their parents are awful. I could go on for a while but a few examples. The mom has chased a kid until she was crying since she grabbed a toy. The father is know to get it to fights if anyone has a different opinion. Mom will freak if you don\u2019t do stuff their way and they refuse to leave even if no other parent is there. The mom tried to stay over a their kids sleepover and freaked when the person hosting was confused.\n\nThey are a nightmare and not really friend with my kid so no invited. They found out and were pissed. The other parents are also mad that I excluded a kid and now some are not going to the party. They have told me I am a jerk.\n\nAm I? Should I just send an invite and deal with the parents.\n\n\nUpdate: I sent a text to the mother. Her kid is invited if she does drop off like all the other parents and she and her husband can not cause issue like what happens other times. I made it clear why not getting an invite is due to there previous behavior\n\nNever mind, they are uninvited again after she responded by calling me a cunt and my daughter a bitch. I\u2019m sending this in the school chat that people have been bothering me on  and explaining why this is the type of behavior I don\u2019t want to be near.", "created_utc": 1696087035, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16w9htd/aita_for_not_inviting_a_kid_to_my_kids_birthday/", "score": 2228, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should have invited him because the blowback from the other parents is going to hang around a lot longer than you think and also may reflect on your child.", "Why do parents have to come at all\u2026? That\u2019s the part that confuses me. Don\u2019t parents drop their kids off at birthday parties and then come pick them up later?", "ETA I cannot believe all the responses calling you an AH because you don\u2019t want to invite a person who gets violent and fight people around children. \n\nMy BIL and his girlfriend are like this and we are no contact because of it. You can\u2019t control their behavior, only yours and I\u2019m telling you now avoidance is key. Their behavior has had multiple negative consequences for my niece & nephew and my MIL cuz she\u2019s the only who has anything to do with them. This is a damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t situation. I see both points of view and feel for the child in this situation but what his parents do isn\u2019t in your control and you\u2019re not excluding him because of him or his behavior but his parents and that\u2019s out of his control too. His parents are the AH here and unfortunately that means the consequences trickle down to their child and that\u2019s solely due to them and their behavior. So NTA. Especially since the dad has violent outbursts. You need to protect your own family and your peace of mind.", ">The rules of the school is that if you hand out invites on school grounds everyone needs to be invited.

Saw your edit. Make sure the other parents and school know how the mom reacted to you. Especially the part where she called your child a bitch. This isn\u2019t anything I\u2019ll want to subject my kid to.", "Nta, you can invite or exclude anyone you dam well please without an explanation.  It's your money and your party.", "NTA. \n\nMaybe I'm out of touch but I don't get this everyone needs to be invited thing.

I didn\u2019t get invited to things as a kid (people I wasn\u2019t friends with) and it only helped me to learn that not everything in this life is for me. Kids need to learn you\u2019re not going to be invited to everything and not everyone is going to be your friend. There are kids in my daughter\u2019s class that she just doesn\u2019t like. And they don\u2019t get invited to her party it\u2019s just that simple.", "YTA -  You wanna know why?  You included every single kid in the class except one kid.  This singled this kid out for exclusion.  This kid knows that every one of their friends are going to a party that they're not invited to.  \n\nIf you wanted a party without these parents, you could have easily planned a smaller party.  Maybe your kid could choose five or six of their closer friends for a sleepover or some other cool activity.  You didn't need to include everyone in this party.  No one expects you to include everyone.  But inviting everyone except one child, that's not cool.", "NTA- controversial but the terrible behaviour of  the parents has consequences - no way would i invite someone who will not leave when asked or who might actually start a fight and my kids birthday party.

If you don\u2019t want certain people around you or your family you have every right not to invite them. And screw social acceptance, people need to realize that there is nothing wrong with being an individual and that there are people who will just not like you regardless of how much you try to fit in. It\u2019s better to teach kids these lessons young so they don\u2019t go through life trying to be people pleasers. Also, by the time these kids are adults they may be lucky if they are still friends with a single person that they went to elementary school with. NTA!", "Nta", "No, no invite.   You don't want these people in your home.", "NTA, your house and your rules, your party, so you get to invite who you want. Yes, it sucks that you have to exclude a kid in order not to have to deal with his parents. But if they won't drop the kid off, leave, and pick the child up after, I don't see any other options. I mean, if every parent of the kids invited is upset, maybe send out a cancellation notice and do a party with just family.", "NTA. You get to decide who goes and who doesn't and for what reason. You don't have to make your reasons or the guest list public.  The kid is going to miss out, but actions have consequences.", "NTA, and i\u2019ve donde the same. Im sorry for the kid, really he doesnt deserved it but they need to understand that their behavior is afecting their son", "NTA. Poor kid, but everything happening to him is 100% the fault of his horrible, horrible parents, not anyone else, full stop.", "Thank you so much for posting this in the school parent group chat. I\u2019m betting must\u2019ve been folks that hadn\u2019t experienced their level of imbalance yet!! Totally understandable to me and the way you reached out to invite the kid and not the parents was a good wholesome move. The parents fucked it up past and present, once again.", "NTA\nYou should tell the parents their behavior ia the reason you aren't inviting their child. Yup,  you will be called a jerk for that too.  But the kid deserves to have a social life and his parents are seriously getting in the way of that. It might be onky second grade now but in a few years he won't have any friends because of his parents attitudes.", "Nta. You followed the school rules and distributed the invitations out of school. And I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting toxic parents there. I mean it sucks for their kid but I still wouldn\u2019t want to deal with the parents. When it\u2019s their child\u2019s party they are more than welcome to invite anyone they want. But your child\u2019s party isn\u2019t there and for that one your allowed to invite anyone you want and exclude who you want.", "I hate to be that person, but guys the kid knows why. He cannot be oblivious to the embarrassment that is his parents. And if he is now he won\u2019t be for long. Kids pick up on lots of things that adults think they don\u2019t. He may not be able to articulate it, but he probably knows his parents do things that make other people upset. He just isn\u2019t able to do anything about it. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t think inviting everyone except this one kid is ok, I also don\u2019t agree with the \u201cyou have to make yourself uncomfortable/unhappy/unsafe so the kid doesn\u2019t get bullied\u201d mentality. No one has an obligation in life to make themselves uncomfortable or unsafe (fighting dad remember?) just so others are happy or feel validated. ESH. \n\nI would say going forward you can invite the kid but call and specifically explain to the parents they aren\u2019t allowed to stay if he comes. Be rude if you need to but lay it out. There is a 99% chance they won\u2019t show up but you\u2019ll have met the social obligation of inviting them. And if they do show and try to stay just tell them bye and hold your boundaries. Either they go & leave the kid or they go and take him with them but they aren\u2019t staying.", "NTA - all of these Y T A are people who expect those other parents to act reasonably\u2026. Except they don\u2019t. They refuse to let the kid be dropped off, they cause issues wherever they go, I wouldn\u2019t have invited the kid either. While the other parents who are now refusing to go are probably not wanting to start a precedence\u2026 that kids parents are the A. That poor kid will be ostracized because of their parents.", "NTA - you wanted a nice peaceful drama free event for your child stick to your beliefs because the other parents may just be scared to actually call them out on their bs it seems to me I wouldn\u2019t invite them anywhere either", "NTA and less so now you have invited the child with conditions on the parents. It's not his fault his parents can't behave but I see why you wouldn't want them there. \n\nBut I feel for the decent kid who has to manage his awful parents.", "NTA", "People calling you an asshole because of singling out 1 child are ludicrous. Imagine if the parents were racist? Would they still force you to be friendly with people you don't gel with? Imagine being an adult and still being forced to do things you don't want to do. The rest of you can deal with assholes and the bullshit they come with and I'll sidestep that and enjoy a nice peaceful and non dramatic life thank you. NTA", "NTA after that edit. Fuck those entitled parents", "NTA. Not everyone is entitled to an invite. Period.", "They sound awful. NTA", "NTA.  Those two parents seem to be a real pain to deal with, and you have the right to keep a distance from them.  Your priority is your kid and what influences you want around him.  If the other parents want to skip a kid party because of this, that is their choice.  I feel bad for that kid.", "NTA. You're hosting the party and the parents are the asshole for making themselves such that you don't want to invite them. And the parents who are backing out I think are assholes for not minding their own business.", "NTA and this rule of the school is absolutely bonkers especially in times like these. Feeding two dozens of kids. Who the hell can afford that?", "NTA. Feel sorry for the kid", "NTA.", "Invite who you want.  You shouldn\u2019t have to put up with toxic people just to please the group.  NTA.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. If the parents keep their shit up, their kid will be excluded from a lot more than just this one party. You\u2019re allowed to invite who you want to your home. Sucks for the kid though because he doesn\u2019t understand his parents are insufferable but then again, If he\u2019s being raised in that type of environment, I have a feeling he\u2019ll also be insufferable in the near future as well.", "Nta.

You did the right thing sending them by mail.", "My daughter had a sleepover for a 10th birthday party with some of her friends. Well this crazy neighbor sent her 3 years younger kid over to crash the party. It didn\u2019t work. She was sent home and I then had to deal with the mom. It was nuts. Who does that?\n\nEdit spelling", "Read the edit. Nta", "NTA. Someone had to be the first one to tell those shitty parents what's what.\n\nHopefully the rest of the parents follow your lead and those shitty parents finally get it through their thick skulls.", "NTA\nOP followed school protocol and sent invites out via mail. \nThrowing a bday party for a kid is not that easy and it\u2019s pretty hectic the day prior and the day of. It\u2019s fair for OP to not want to deal with the extra stress of parents who aren\u2019t respectful of other people\u2019s boundaries. \nYes, it sucks the child is facing the consequences of their parent\u2019s\u2019 behavior. And it\u2019s understandable why schools have a policy of inviting the whole class. OP maybe should have sent the text out to the problematic parents before word went around about the invites (bcs let\u2019s be real, they\u2019re bound to find out somehow) but at the very least they gave the mom a chance.", "NTA. Those parents are completely unhinged and it\u2019s sad that means the kid suffers, but it is what it is. You do not need to invite that chaos and danger to your home just to protect the feelings of a kid. Most of these commenters don\u2019t have a true mental picture of how outlandish and dangerous these parents really are. Why would you risk having the party ruined? \n\nAfter the edit: I appreciate your attempt to include the kid and I\u2019m glad you now have evidence of why you attempted to exclude them in the first place. I would also start using the appropriate words for these people, like aggressive, violent, overbearing, lacks healthy boundaries and refuses to leave private homes when asked. Be clear with everyone about their messes-up behaviors; don\u2019t be polite, or coy. Always mention police involvement and not wanting to expose your children to their antics. \n\nDamn I feel sorry for their kid, but there\u2019s not much you can do since kids & parents are a package deal.", "NTA. As a teacher, I find this policy overreaching. They don't force this in middle or high school. These days, elementary students switch classes frequently and aren't always with the same students all day, anyway. All the other parents are TAs. No one should ever be forced to invite others just because they occupy the same classroom.", "It may be the rules of the school, but outside the school they have no say you say who you want to invite to your kids party the school has no right to tell parents what to do on their own time the nerve of the school to try to do that", "NTA. If people don't want to attend your party, that's fine. You get to decide who is worth the trouble of socializing with.", "Nta. Tell everyone - the kids parents and the people who are upset exactly why they are excluded. Offer a compromise where you let the child come on the condition that the parents drop off the child and pick up him up - but don't enter your home.", "NTA\n\nYour child is not really friends with the kids anyway so why should you be pressed to invite them? Kids parties are expensive and stressful as is.  Hopefully those asshole parents learn something from this.", "No judgement, but genuinely curious\u2026 are parents invited to kids party\u2019s these days? Is that a thing? When I was a kid, kids were just dropped off at a party and picked up later and the parents didn\u2019t interact much. My elementary school best friends parents and my parents were absolutely polar opposites and we hung out all the time. Just pick ups and drop offs.", "Why can\u2019t you explain to the other parents how awful these people are? Or why don\u2019t they know if you do? Get other people to vouch for their behavior if all this happened at other parties.", "NTA. You're doing the right things for the right reasons.", "NTA. They sound unsafe and you are under no obligation to have unsafe people in your home or at your event.", "I'm pretty sure it goes along the lines of, it's my fucking event and I'll invite whoever I want to to it.", "*And they STILL can\u2019t figure out why they\u2019re not invited? Or why their child is not invited?*\n\nSO thick-headed. I just hope and pray that the kid has a solid head on his shoulders, and is wise enough to understand that his parents behavior is not behavior that he should imitate in ANY form.", "NTA. I don't understand the votes saying YTA. You TRIED with them but they're not people who respect boundaries. That sucks for their kid but you are not required to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.", "Keep seeing Yta , Did you guys not read that the parents called ops child a bitch ?? These people are unstable and I\u2019m glad op has text evidence of calling a little girl a bitch so more parents can start standing up to these crazy individuals", "Why is the school telling you what to do on your own time? That\u2019s some bs right there.", "You now have some leverage.  If it were me, I\u2019d let the parents know that their child is welcome to come if he is dropped off and picked up after the party is over.  Personally, I think it\u2019s entirely appropriate to tell them that it is their previous behavior that led you to exclude their child, so as a consequence, if their child is to attend, he must come alone.  Put it all back on them.  If they scream and howl and won\u2019t let their kid come, that\u2019s their choice and you can let the other parents know that.  \n\nNTA.

Are they a danger to your family?  Could they cause trauma to your child?  If that is the case, who cares, it's your house!  \n\nNow if it's only things that make people semi uncomfortable then it was kind of rude to invite everyone but them.  Maybe next time just pick a smaller group of close friends of your child.", "If your child and there child aren\u2019t really friends, I don\u2019t see the issues.

You have a good reason for not inviting this kid.\n\nI had a situation where I had a party for my daughter and her girlfriends and she wanted to include her \"book buddy.\" Book buddy's mother showed up with her son and said he was great with kids, and would not leave. It was an event at a venue and I paid per person. I'm sorry I did not kick brother, mother and book buddy out.\n\nThis kid did not deserve to be invited and you do not have to put up with the parents.", "The mom called your daughter a bitch?

Sorry the kid has to suffer but you shouldn\u2019t have those parents around your kids and yourself", "Soft YTA. You did exclude a kid as far as all of them go.

Grow up.", "NTA for keeping the awful parents out or for not being able to think of a workable alternative.\n\nDepending on how hardshell you're willing to be, you might have made this work. You could have sent a special invitation to that one family. In it, you could make it very clear that the kid was invited but the parents were not. They were not to set foot on your property and would not be permitted into your house. If they push their way in, the police would be called to remove them.\n\nBall's now in their court to accept or decline.\n\nI'm not pushing for this approach, since you'll make explicit enemies of those parents rather than the indirect enemies of simply not inviting their kid.", "It would have been better for you to ask your child to pick out his closest friends in the class and just mail invites to them.

Parents of children in second grade vary a lot in terms of how willing they are to drop their kids off places.\n\nIn my experience, parents of kindergartners almost always stay at any kind of children's party, and as the children age, there's a steady reduction in the fraction of parents that want to stay. By second grade, parents that stay are in the minority, but I could always guarantee which of my kid's friends' parents would stay. \n\nI know very few parents who allow their choice of whether to stay or go while their kid is at a party to be determined by what other parents are doing, because that's irrelevant. They're going to stay if they think that their child needs the reassurance that they are nearby, or if they want to be on hand in case of an accident. Other parents' choices aren't going to affect theirs.\n\nI've never met a mom who thought she was invited to a children's sleepover, though. Kids are ready for sleepovers at different ages, and some second graders aren't ready. That's OK - it's OK for someone not to go to a sleepover. I've had a few kids come for the evening, and get picked up in their pajamas late at night \"because they have to be up early the next morning so can't stay overnight\", which lets them not have to tell their friends that they're scared to sleep away from home.\n\nInviting all the kids in your child's class except one is a pretty shitty thing to do to that kid. Sure - you followed the rules and sent invitations in the mail, but kids talk, and they're all going to be talking about going to your kid's party, or having been to your kid's party, which is going to be rough on the kid who you chose not to invite.

Kudos to you for mailing them\u2026but\u2026just eliminating one child, even though your concerns are valid, still leaves one child in the sidelines. My advice would be to narrow the number of kids your child can invite to just neighborhood friends and best friends from school\u2026.maybe 10 children and family\u2026..so that it's not every single child but one. Or split it up\u2026family only party first earlier in the day then take your child and a few friends to the movies later, etc. That way it's not including everyone in the class but one.

Not ever being willing to leave a kid alone with other kids and adults, not allowing her child to work out their own disagreements with other children.   \n\nTo this woman, not allowing her inside is the same as not allowing her to protect her child.  No wonder she's been freaking out every time her kid goes to a party.", "This!", "They could also all be wombats. She didn't disprove that either.", "OP has confirmed in a comment she witness the father getting into fights with other parents, so.", "I had a really big birthday when I was 3 because it coincides with family coming in from out of town for a reunion. \n\nI'm the same age as you, and alas- were not old yet but we're certainly aren't children either (except me, because I'm still a little bit stupid)", "Relax, I just turned 68.", "I\u2019m a little bored, if you make an \u201coff the chest\u201d post about this parent couple that would be lovely and hilarious and a little empathetically annoying to read all about their crazy incidents.", "I hate to assume, but if he's starting fights for *particular* political reasons, these might be fueled by a dangerous cult, and I wouldn't want my kids around that. I feel for their kiddo, but I'm also very tired of catering to feelings that don't make sense (ie, starting a fight at a kid's party over who someone did or didn't vote for). Their parents sound ridiculous at best, and in a worst case scenario, very dangerous.", "Not to mention that the mom called OP a c*** and her elementary-aged child a b****. This family is whacko. The school should be notified about their behavior.", "Why are they inviting the entire class? Read the comment again.", "People would rather OP start a fight at a children's party with someone known to start fights, rather than preempt the problem.", "You\u2019re missing the point \u2026. Every other child was invited without the requirement of their parents behavior. \n\nIf I invited my entire staff to a party at my home & excluded one person because I don\u2019t like their partner. That would not be okay. Either invite everyone or select the kids who you want to invite.", "I made one, it in my profile", "Because it\u2019s a requirement at the vast majority of schools, at least here in the US, where I\u2019m assuming OP is located since they mentioned inviting the whole class is a rule. OP skirted that rule by not sending out invitations during school hours or on school property. Word still gets around though. It\u2019s very much a thing to make sure all kids are included and don\u2019t feel left out.", "Yeah. Literally OP says the father is known to start fights with anyone who doesn't agree with him. Does it suck the one kid doesn't get invited? Sure. Does it make OP an asshole because they don't want problem parents starting shit that may result in cops having to be called *at their child's birthday?* Absolutely not, and anyone saying they are is delusional. It's been made clear by OPs post that these parents have been problematic for other people and do not respect any boundaries placed.", "If that partner was violent and attacked other parents? Sure you'd be justified.", "A comment said he had the call the cops before. I don't understand any of these YTA responses.\n\nEdit: said 'nta when I meant yta'", "Why would I exclude that person? I just wouldn\u2019t include their partner.\n\nEdit word missing"]}
