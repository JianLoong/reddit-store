It was kind of a disaster.\n\nThen when it was all over and kids stopped coming to our house and we went to bed, we heard something only to go out and find that some brats threw toilet rolls and eggs over the house and ran away. We spent a long while cleaning it up and I told him that he should have just given them candy like I told him to, and he has been mildly upset by all of this saying that I'm acting like a jerk.\n\nBut to be honest?

Evidently it was glittery playdoh.", "That\u2019s why I agree with a commenter above. I don\u2019t think it was because of the trick or treaters.

The kids trick or treating get so much candy a tooth brush doesn\u2019t even register.  You grab it and move on the the next house.  You dot become an evil villain plotting revenge.  Besides egging and t-peeing a house is usually a calculated move that you plan in advance.", "Thats a possibility if we assume her students know where she lives, she may not even live in the same area as where she teaches. I have a middle schooler and we couldnt tell you where the teachers live we\u2019ve never even ran into one out and about randomly, other parents allllll the time so its unlikely but not impossible and it would be a hilarious twist.", "This is my take too.\n\nTrick or treating is for little kids.

Kids demand candy, and threaten mischief if they don't get it.Trick or Treat. \n\nThe kids kept their word. It's Halloween, and they responded the way we have for the last 5 generations.

Please", "No one likes cleaning up a mess brought on by somebody else who had been warned.", "I'd agree with you.

The husband didn't just not participate, which would be ok, he violated the very spirit of Halloween with his offerings. With the possible exception of Christmas, no holiday is more beloved by children, and this one night belongs to them.

It's originally mainly from Ireland, a mix of Celtic pegan and Catholic traditions that went to the US with the potato famine victims. \n\nThe candy tradition came from a mediaeval church tradition. Poor people would visit the houses of wealthier families and receive pastries called soul cakes in exchange for a promise to pray for the souls of the homeowners\u2019 dead relatives.
