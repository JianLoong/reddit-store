It was kind of a disaster.\n\nThen when it was all over and kids stopped coming to our house and we went to bed, we heard something only to go out and find that some brats threw toilet rolls and eggs over the house and ran away.

It was kind of an \u201coh, yeah, I could really use a drink right now\u201d kind of response from almost everyone.", "It\u2019s a good idea to have kazoos or other toys available in case you get kiddos with dietary restrictions, then they can have a treat too!", "Back in my day, we called this mischief night. We knew from past experience and older siblings which houses were open to trick or treaters and which houses were not. The houses that were not open to trick or treaters got the mischief! If you didn't learn your lesson that year you got it again the next year.", "You know, I\u2019m always liked an artfully teepeed tree. Sometimes it looks so beautiful the way the toilet paper flitters in the breeze \ud83d\ude06", "I find it hilarious that people are mad that kids received a stash of free candy but find it completely inappropriate that one home gave them a free toothbrush and toothpaste to help take care of their teeth from all the sugar\ud83e\udd23. It's literally called trick or treat meaning either or so\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. My kids got plenty of trinkets including a religious dvd and pocket hand sanitizer. You say thank you and go about your business. If you can't be grateful for what you get then you shouldn't be running around knocking on doors asking for things.", "Nope, they were right. Willy Wonka became a candy maker because his dad was a dentist and forbade him from having *any* candy.", "Our neighborhood dentist didn\u2019t. But the brushes she and her husband handed out were Halloween themed (one year they had glow in the dark cats and bats on them, which was extra cool) and every year the husband dressed as a giant tooth. \n\nYou\u2019d get a little black, purple or orange bag with a cool brush, a weirdly sized (it wasn\u2019t travel size, but it wasn\u2019t full size either. it was kinda a weird size, lol) tube of that Crest Sparkle kid\u2019s toothpaste with the extra fluoride, some floss and usually stickers or an eraser or some other cute little non-candy swag. \n\nHitting up their house was a must every year and afaik they never got egged or \ud83e\uddfbed. \n\nFound out as a teenager that their tooth brush offerings actually weren\u2019t just because they both worked in dental care, but because their two kids both had severe food allergies and they were determined to be a house that gave away something that wouldn\u2019t set off an allergic kid or make a kid feel bad asking for a non allergen option.

It's a clear\n threat. Give me a treat or I'll give you a trick.\" Do I approve of vandalising somebody's house? No. Did I ever do as a kid?

I was thinking Charlie Bucket bc his dad worked in the toothpaste factory putting the caps on.", "That's pretty fun, actually.", "Okie, sunshine.", "Apples and Oranges. Did they physically touch you? Throw something on you or into you? Cause distress or pain? Stole your time to clean up their mess? No?

In the last few years our town has sponsored an entire 7 blocks of Trick or Treat Street along one of the main roads in town.\n\nSo this year I filled a HUGE messenger bag with about $50 of fun sized chocolate candies, plus fruit by the foot, fruit rollups, gushers, and starbursts. Then I went to Trick or Treat Street and played Mobile Trick or Treat Spot.\n\nAll kids had to do was say the magic words (Trick or Treat) and they got to pick a piece from the bag. By the time the event ended after 2 hours, the bag was EMPTY. Even the kids who only got a Starburst were delighted! :D", "What?!?! I've never heard it be phrased like that LMAO. How ridiculous. I wouldn't be surprised if vandalism is an American thing\ud83d\ude44. This country is getting more and more embarrassing.", "Oh no, I was referring to Wonka\u2019s dad because of the flashback in which he burns young Willy\u2019s trick-or-treat haul.", "Definition of trick or treat\n: a Halloween practice in which children wearing costumes go from door to door in a neighborhood saying \"trick or treat\" when a door is opened to ask for treats with the implied threat of playing tricks on those who refuse\nJust because you haven't heard it, doesn't mean it's not how it is.  Besides, why shit on America when you could be doing something helpful. Sure, America isn't the best but it's not the worst at all."]}
