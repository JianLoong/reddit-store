{"id": 16162, "submission_id": "1350f70", "title": "AITA for going to a birthday party in casual attire?", "selftext": "I (21F) recently went to a birthday party for a girl I know. I am not very close to this girl, but she was inviting the rest of my friend group and so it was probably somewhat of a courtesy invite. From the little I do know about her, I can tell that she is very girly and loves to dress up. I am the complete opposite. I am a tomboy and I hate wearing dresses and skirts, and am much more comfortable in jeans and a T-shirt.The party was in my friend's apartment, so no super fancy restaurant or venue or anything, but the birthday girl asked us all to dress in semi-formal attire for some reason. I made sure to let her know ahead of time that I am not comfortable in dresses or fancy clothes and would not be comfortable dressing up, and she told me I could wear a suit or a jumpsuit, and that she wanted her party to \"feel like an occasion\". Again, I am not comfortable in formal attire and if this were a venue with a dress code, I would bite the bullet for her sake, but it was literally just in an apartment, so there was no official rule and she had no right to dictate what I do unless I'm harming someone else at her party. I told her as much and she said that she didn't want to fight over it but she would really appreciate it if I \"put in some effort\".  I thought it was very shallow to put a dress code on a birthday party, since what someone's wearing shouldn't be as important as the fact that they're there to celebrate with you, and I also wasn't too keen on the idea of someone thinking that their birthday gives them the right to control people down to what they *wear,* so I told her that I would not be dressing up. She said ok.\n\nWhen the party rolled around, I stuck to what I said I would do and came in my usual jeans and T-shirt. Everyone was taking pictures and nobody asked me to be in any, which was making me feel very left out. Every time I got in a picture by asking if I could be in it, whoever was taking it would take one with me and then immediately take one without as soon as I left. I asked one of the girls I knew that was there if everything was ok and why I couldn't join in any of the pictures. She told me it was because of the way I was dressed, and that everyone else was dressed up and my clothing was making the party look \"less special\". I got very sad and left. I really didn't think people would actively exclude me just because of my clothes; it just didn't seem like a big deal to me, but I know that I was told to dress up. AITA?\n\nEDIT: For those of you saying there was a dress code, there wasn't, the birthday girl just wanted people to dress semi-formal, but this wasn't enforced. Nobody stopped me from coming how I was dressed, they just excluded me.\n\nEDIT 2: Yes, I could have not gone. But the birthday girl and her guests would have continued feeling entitled to control how people dress that way and I was hoping to show them that we can still have fun when people dress how they're comfortable and that clothes are really no big deal.", "created_utc": 1682973167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1350f70/aita_for_going_to_a_birthday_party_in_casual/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you cannot follow dress code, the alternative is to not attend. You were very rude.", "YTA\n\n\n\"...so there was no official rule and she had no right to dictate what I do...\"\n\n\nYES she does, it is her birthday party with a theme for formal wear.", "YTA\n\nShe told you in advance that people were going/supposed to be dressed up, you blew her off, and now you are throwing yourself a pity party because you were the only person not dressed up and you felt left out.", "YTA \n\nMore so for intentionally not following the dress code and then being upset and leaving because you felt left out.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA\n\n>but the birthday girl asked us all to dress in semi-formal attire\n\nIf you don't like the dress code, do not go.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't want to follow a dress code, then got upset when you had to face the consequences.", "JFC, I'm so over people who carry on about a dress code like they were asked to cut off a limb. I hate, and I mean HATE dressing up. I work from home so I wear the junkiest crap, my normal attire is jeans & t-shirts and spending money on clothes is like pulling teeth, but when I have someplace to go where I need to look presentable, I suck it up, act like an adult and dress nicely because IT'S NOT ABOUT ME and I can deal with the \"discomfort\" for a few hours. \n\nOf course, YTA.", "YTA. This isn't about control. You also did not HAVE to go, just because someone invites you to something does not mean you are required to attend. If you really didn't want to dress up, you could have said \"Thank you, but no thank you\".", "YTA - whether it\u2019s at a venue or at her house, it\u2019s her party. If you don\u2019t agree, don\u2019t attend. Plus you said you hardly know this girl so why was if such a big deal to take a stand and go against her lol", "YTA. There was a dress code for the party and you blatantly disregarded it. You should have declined the invite of you didn't want to adhere to it", "YTA. Themed parties are normal and you actively decided to go against it and still get mad when people didn't want you in their pictures.\n\nYou sound like someone who would wear white to a wedding.", "YTA - If you can't adhere to a very reasonable dress code you shouldn't have gone. This wasn't some bridezilla demanding everyone needs to be identical down to the hair color, this was \"please dress nicely for the occasion so we can all look great in photos and have a fun party\". **You were disrespectful and entitled.** Neither of those nasty traits belong at a birthday party, and you should be even more embarrassed that you had the audacity to pull this stunt at the home of someone you don't even know that well. Next time, stay home in your jeans. Though I doubt there will be a next time anyone invites you, you made sure everyone there knows you are a selfish party pooper at heart.", "YTA If you weren't going to dress up, you shouldn't have went. Any feeling of being left out is all on you. You made sure that you were singled out by not dressing like everyone else, you were treated differently when it came to pictures and that's no one's fault but your own. \n\nBTW, once I was going to attend a military ball. I hate dresses. With a passion. So I went out and had a tux tailor made for me. You could have found something that was closer to semi-formal than jeans and a t-shirt and likely wouldn't have been pushed out of pictures and such.  A pair of nice tailored pants, white shirt and a bow tie would have been just fine, I would imagine.", "YTA - It was her birthday party. You knew what she wanted her guests to wear, and you refused. Dress codes for parties are a fairly common thing.\n\nIf you felt so strongly about your autonomy, why didn't you just not go?", "YTA - You were told the party had a dress code multiple times and are now shocked when you got singled out? This was really your fault.", "YTA. You were invited to a party with a specific theme, and you deliberately flouted theme. You made the event about you, rather than the guest of honor, which misses the point of a birthday party.", "YTA.\n\nIf you didn't want to play, then why go? You were a party poop. They were going to have nice pictures of them all dressed up and then there would be you, looking like a slob.", "YTA. You were informed, the host was flexible, and yet you came after being told multiple times. It was rude to show up to something where at this point of showing up casually, was flat out rude.", "YTA \n\nInstead of arguing with her about HER party, you could have just sucked it up or not gone.", "YTA\n\nShe isn't policing your every day wear, it was a theme. It's no different than if she threw a roaring 20s theme party, dress up and be in the pics or don't /don't be in the pics but don't complain about your own choice.", "YTA. You chose not to participate in the vibe of the party, but to go anyway. You can\u2019t honestly be surprised that you didn\u2019t fit in with all the other people who were into that.", "YTA. From the moment of invite until your own pity party you made her birthday all about you.", "I think yta. She told you the dress code in advance and if you weren't comfortable in wearing what she proposed to her party, you should've considered not going. \n\nIf she made it clear that she wanted everyone to dress up and you chose not to dress up, you shouldn't be surprised that people were excluding you for a difference in your dressing style. It hurts, yes, but you knew in advance you were doing something against what the birthday girl wanted.", "YTA. If you cannot adhere to the dress code of the event then don\u2019t go. Showing up in jeans and a T is not cool at all. You don\u2019t have to go to events where you are not comfortable. You are not the victim here.", "YTA. You're at the party to celebrate the birthday girl.  She wasn't asking you to wear something that didn't vibe with your gender expression or anything, she just wanted you to wear something semi-formal -- but whatever, you and she both knew that you were going against her wishes there, you had that conversation, you made your choice.  Where you're doubling down on being TA is getting mad at other people, who dressed up as the birthday girl asked, for not wanting to have someone in jeans and a T-shirt in the middle of a picture where everyone else was semi-formally dressed.", "YTA.\n\nIf you are unwilling to participate in the attire of the party, just don't go. You were made aware ahead of time.", "Yta\n\nYou excluded yourself by not dressing up.", "YTA  If you don't want to honor her request then stay home. She was kind enough to include you. \nThere are plenty of people that don't wear traditional female dress up clothes and look amazing. There are tons of options. \nYou were lazy and self centered and then had the gall to complain that you weren't in the pics? Did you have to ask?", "YTA\n\nPeople have every right to dictate the dress code at their party. If you weren't comfortable dressing up, you should've stayed home. No one forced you to go. You're not even close to her so it shouldn't be a big deal whether you attend or not", "YTA, and very obviously so. You were courtesy invited to the birthday party of someone you don\u2019t really consider a friend: a party with a theme you found particularly unappealing. First of all, why even go? Second of all, why do you expect to be included in activities in which you are actively not participating? They didn\u2019t exclude you, you excluded yourself. There\u2019s nothing wrong with excluding yourself, but it\u2019s unreasonable of you to perceive this as them targeting you or treating you poorly. They were taking glamour shots, and you weren\u2019t glammed up. Of course they weren\u2019t putting you in their pictures. It would be different if this was an everyday occurrence, but it was one night at a birthday celebration for a person you aren\u2019t close to. This night was about her, but you\u2019re making it about you.", "OP, this is what happens when you listen to too much Reddit advice from people who get belligerent at people even *suggesting* that certain events have expected dress codes or that dress norms are worth following. YTA.", "YTA, there was a dress code, not a hard one to follow, wear trousers and a shirt if you didn't want to wear a dress. The options were follow the dress code or just don't go. The fact that you got upset no one wanted pictures of you after turning up out of theme is somewhat laughable, you made your bed then had to lie in it.", "YTA.\n\nThe hostess had a dress code for her event, which you were not required to attend. You *chose* to attend, while completely ignoring the dress code. Of course people didn't want you in their photos. If you don't like to dress up, then do everyone else a favor and decline the invitation - you aren't impressing anyone by your inability to read the invitation or the room.", "YTA. The party had a dress code that you chose to blatantly disregard, so no you don\u2019t get to play victim here.", "YTA  If you don't want to honor her request then stay home. She was kind enough to include you. \nThere are plenty of people that don't wear traditional female dress up clothes and look amazing. There are tons of options. \nYou were lazy and self centered and then had the gall to complain that you weren't in the pics? Did you have to ask?", "YTA. No one was making you go.", "YTA\n\nYou chose to attend a party with a dress code and willfully ignored the required attire. I get not liking getting dressed up (I\u2019m the same) but no one has to include you in the pics. You excluded yourself by dressing down. \n\nAnd yes, the person throwing the party can tell people how to dress. Your choice is then whether you go (and dress up) or you don\u2019t go and are comfy doing your own thing in your jeans and tshirt. \n\nYou can\u2019t have it both ways.", "YTA.  You were very rude.  You knew the dress code, and you deliberately ignored it.  You should have skipped the party.", "YTA. I think you're reaching when you say she \"had no right to dictate what I do.\" Or that she was \"controlling\" people. It's not \"dictating\" when people throw a Halloween party and ask people to come in costume, for example. Your friend just wanted people to look nice for her party; that's all. And she wasn't enforcing a dress code, barring you at the door from entering.\n\nThere are ways to look dressy w/o investing in a new dress or tailored suit. Thrift stores can be a big help here. And of course, you don't have to go to any party if you think you'll be uncomfortable.\n\nIronically, though you went in the clothes you wanted to wear, you ended up feeling uncomfortable anyway.", "FAFO...YTA", "YTA \n\nYou new there was a dress code, then get shocked people took another picture once you were out. I mean you kinda set yourself up for some shit.", "YTA\nIt\u2019s no different then someone hosting any other kind of party and attaching a dress code. Different options were offered to you for what you could wear, but in the end you excluded yourself. Someone\u2019s house vs a venue shouldn\u2019t matter. If she hosted a fancy restaurant it sounds as though you would have complied. Just respect the birthday girls wishes and bite the bullet for a few hours.", "YTA. \n\nThe birthday girl did everything right on her end: she gave everyone lots of warning about the dress code (enough to go back and forth several times), and she responded to your initial concerns with an excellent compromise. So long as you put in an effort, you could come in your own style. \n\nFor your part, you decided that for some reason the mere existence of...a restaurant? is worthy of effort but a party isn't. Then you decided that a dress code, which is pretty common at parties, is somehow a form of oppression that you'd protest with your casual attire? ... that makes no sense, so we've already veered into 'you're the asshole' territory. \n\nSo there you are, sticking it to the man with your jeans and t-shirt, and you're surprised that people don't want you in photos? I am honestly baffled that anyone could grow up in our social-media-obsessed culture and not understand that people structure their lives around taking cool photos. It's not a mystery. You went out of your way to spoil the vibe and then started asking to be in photos? By now, you're unequivocally the asshole. \n\nAnd then you pretend to be surprised/hurt/baffled and flounce? Sorry, OP, YTA.", "YTA - you aren't even a friend. If you don't like it just don't go. The world doesn't revolve around you", "YTA. You are not close to the birthday girl, you think the dress code is \"shallow\". Why did you even go to this party? To insult the host?", "YTA. You should've stayed home.", "YTA- This wasn't your party, it was hers. If you were uncomfortable, you had the choice to not go. Just because it wasn't a venue with a dress requirement doesn't make it the dress code any less real. Sure, no one is going to be there to block you from entering, but it's like showing up to a Halloween/Costume party without a costume. You can do it, but it just makes you the asshole.", "YTA. For pouting when not included.", "Yta a thousand Times. You sound very imature and entitled.\nShe has the right to a theme of her party.\nIf you couldn't respect that out of COMMON SENSE, you should've stayed home.\nWhat are you, like 12? For God's sake.", "YTA, yea, you could have put in a little effort.  It doesn't matter where it was.  It was her party.  If you didn't want to follow through with her requested attire you should have declined.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s her special day, she has a dress code for her party. It doesn\u2019t matter if it isn\u2019t a special venue, if there\u2019s a dress code, respect it. OP, you had said it yourself that it was a courtesy invite; you didn\u2019t have to go.\n\nThe girl gave you other options, instead of dresses but you decided to do your own thing. You\u2019re a butthole, OP. If you weren\u2019t comfortable with the dress code, then tell her you can\u2019t go. Ruining someone\u2019s birthday party because you can\u2019t respect their wishes, makes you the butthole.", "Some effort could\u2019ve been made here. I know a lot of people who are the same, not into dressing up and hate suits etc. But I\u2019ve also seen the same people put some effort into dressing up when the situation or occasion called for it. You acted like an AH by not putting in any effort to even slightly dress up. Also, semi formal doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a suit. Could\u2019ve just done a button up shirt and some nice pants and called it good. Sorry OP, YTA", "YTA\n\nYou very consciously chose to stand out, and now you're complaining you stood out. \n\nYou can't have your cake and eat it too, ffs.", "YTA. You said you didnt feel comfortable in a dress and she said wear a suit or jumpsuit just something semi formal. But even that made you uncomfortable? You sound like a 6 year old who doesnt wanna dress up for church. \n\nThen you get confused why people in semi formal attire dont want someone in the pic who is so dressed down? Why would they want you being an eye sore in their pics?", "YTA\u2026if you didn\u2019t want to dress up, you should have just declined the invite.", "YTA. I'm a tomboy too, I dislike dressing up, but I have a few nice blazers for this very reason. You might even get away with a plain white/black t-shirt under the blazer if the blazer is nice enough. You could've sucked it up and put on black pants and a button down (and tie? How tomboy are you?) for a few hours. You could've put on a nice-ish sweater and khaki's, even. \n\nTime to buy a nice jacket, tuxedo pants, black boots, and a button down shirt. There's your outfit, and I promise it'll be comfortable!", "I see your reasoning and appreciate your take on things\u2026 in this case though YTA. If you didn\u2019t feel comfortable and didn\u2019t want to go buy something special then it would have been fine to gracefully thank for the offer (especially since you feel it was a courtesy invite) \n\nYou were graciously invited though you are not a close friend. The goal was to make everyone feel special by having an opportunity to dress up. The majority seemed down to play and it\u2019s fine that you weren\u2019t but you made a BIG THING out of it. Were they rude? Probably\u2026 however in group photos when one person is out of step with the attire it makes it awkward in photos. Were they shallow? Maybe.. however you were so headstrong in your \u201cresistance to control\u201d that you forced yourself upon them in a controlling way.  It was \u201cjust an apartment\u201d which blew them off and you\u2019re mad that they didn\u2019t honor you as the star of the \u201cI do what I want\u201d club.", "YTA - while I agree that a dress code for a birthday party is ridiculous, you should have adhered to it or not gone to the party. I probably would have opted out.", "I mean it was the birthday girls wish to have a dresscode. Like she said you could have worn a jumpsuit or anything like that. iIf you didn\u00b4t feel comfortable to, you could have stayed home. Like you said you weren\u00b4t even that close to her. So it wouldn\u00b4t be weird if you didn\u00b4t go. I know it\u00b4s not the same but imagine you\u00b4re at a halloween Party and didn\u00b4t dress up. Why take pictures together then? It ruins all the fun", "YTA.  You were told the dress code ahead of time and purposely went against it.  The people there let you know they did not appreciate you breaking the dress code either.  The party was not about you, you should not have gone if you could not go with the dress code.", "YTA. I get that you have a comfort zone, but this was a themed event with a dress code. It sounds like you didn't even make an effort then got butthurt about feeling excluded.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t have to go. What if you wanted everyone in a tshirt and jeans for your birthday and everyone showed up in dressy formal? The point is that it\u2019s her birthday.

If you don't like the dress code, don't attend. Sorry if it's \"just in an apartment\" but the dress code meant something to the birthday person. You don't understand the difference between someone trying to control you and someone creating a themed event. You excluded yourself from the pictures by not matching the theme.

She had a dress code. She made that clear.

There was a dress code. You violated it and the host was probably exasperated but just ignored it because she's classier than you.\n\nLet's say I have a wedding with a formal dress code and my uncle shows up in a t-shirt and cargo shorts. I'm annoyed and frustrated that my event/wishes/dress code were disrespected, but it's not worth it to me to cause a scene and start an argument by tossing him out. That doesn't mean there wasn't a dress code, it just means he violated it. I'm not going to let him be in the family pics either. And honestly, he is making *himself* look bad in this hypothetical situation.\n\nYTA. You knew you would be upsetting the birthday girl with your attire. You're admittedly not even close to her and she probably only invited you to be nice, so why go to her party and disrespect her wishes? Just stay home and don't slight her at her own party.

I am not very close to this girl, but she was inviting the rest of my friend group and so it was probably somewhat of a courtesy invite. From the little I do know about her, I can tell that she is very girly and loves to dress up. I am the complete opposite. I am a tomboy and I hate wearing dresses and skirts, and am much more comfortable in jeans and a T-shirt.   \nThe party was in my friend's apartment, so no super fancy restaurant or venue or anything, but the birthday girl asked us all to dress in semi-formal attire for some reason. I made sure to let her know ahead of time that I am not comfortable in dresses or fancy clothes and would not be comfortable dressing up, and she told me I could wear a suit or a jumpsuit, and that she wanted her party to \"feel like an occasion\". Again, I am not comfortable in formal attire and if this were a venue with a dress code, I would bite the bullet for her sake, but it was literally just in an apartment, so there was no official rule and she had no right to dictate what I do unless I'm harming someone else at her party. I told her as much and she said that she didn't want to fight over it but she would really appreciate it if I \"put in some effort\".  I thought it was very shallow to put a dress code on a birthday party, since what someone's wearing shouldn't be as important as the fact that they're there to celebrate with you, and I also wasn't too keen on the idea of someone thinking that their birthday gives them the right to control people down to what they *wear,* so I told her that I would not be dressing up. She said ok.\n\nWhen the party rolled around, I stuck to what I said I would do and came in my usual jeans and T-shirt. Everyone was taking pictures and nobody asked me to be in any, which was making me feel very left out. Every time I got in a picture by asking if I could be in it, whoever was taking it would take one with me and then immediately take one without as soon as I left. I asked one of the girls I knew that was there if everything was ok and why I couldn't join in any of the pictures. She told me it was because of the way I was dressed, and that everyone else was dressed up and my clothing was making the party look \"less special\". I got very sad and left. I really didn't think people would actively exclude me just because of my clothes; it just didn't seem like a big deal to me, but I know that I was told to dress up. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA - The birthday girl literally gave a dress code, you just didn\u2019t follow it because it wasn\u2019t \u201cenforced\u201d (which what did you want to happen?

Nobody stopped me from coming how I was dressed, they just excluded me.\n\nOP, a dress code is set by the hosts - in this case the birthday girl. They have just as much right to set a dress code as a venue or business. \n\nWhen you violate a dress code it's at the host/venu's discretion how they want to deal with that. In this case they choose not to bar you, which was gracious of them.

As this was a private home,  there was no bouncer,  so the attendees used the other tactics at their disposal -- but still exclusion.

If you don\u2019t follow the theme, don\u2019t go; your presence is unwanted. YTA", "yta.... I used to plan fun parties and I love a good theme. I'd spend time decorating, cooking and having a fun time planning and then day of event....someone would ignore the theme and just so up in pants & tee....\nAll that did was show me how little they cared.\n\nI no longer plan parties..... I couldnt get the voice out of my head of \"who cares\"\n\nYou rained on her parade.", "YTA. You sound exhausting. \n\nYou were aware that you got a courtesy invite and used it an an opportunity to prove that you don\u2019t even deserve that in the future.", "\"EDIT 2: Yes, I could have not gone. But the birthday girl and her guests would have continued feeling entitled to control how people dress that way and I was hoping to show them that we can still have fun when people dress how they're comfortable and that clothes are really no big deal.\"\n\nSo, how'd that work out for you? You left early, very sad. Didn't work out at all, did it?", "YTA. It seemed really important to you to not participate in the theme. Everyone treated you like you weren't participating because you weren't participating. You could have borrowed a blazer and a tie. You are too young to act like an old grouch.", "YTA host your own party if you want to be the center of attention. Stay home if you\u2019re only going to be a wet blanket.", "you can 100 percent dress up without wearing a dress. jeans and a t shirt when it\u2019s \u201csemi formal\u201d is rude. furthermore it\u2019s rude go to an event underdressed, period. YTA", "YTA for me. Look, I\u2019m the same age and my clothes and presentation are quite masculine. If the host had said \u201cno, you have to wear a dress\u201d then I would get it, but it seemed like she was willing to be flexible within the dress code. I know it can be hard out there when you seem to dress differently or care about different things than all your female friends but that is not an excuse in this case. \n\nThis event clearly had a dress code that was conveyed to you by the host, and she is free to request that guests follow that dress code for her party! The guests, in turn, are free to either attend the party following the dress code, or to not attend. If you think the dress code is stupid and you don\u2019t want to follow it then don\u2019t go, but it is rude to the host and other partygoers to show up in casual clothes.", "YTA-You were told that the birthday girl wanted people to dress semi-formal. That is a dress code. If you\u2019re unwilling to follow it at all don\u2019t attend the event.", "All that pick me energy and yet no one picked you lol. When you\u2019re so dedicated to not being like the other girls, why are you surprised when they don\u2019t like you?\n\nYTA", "If clothes are no big deal, why couldn't you dress up?  \nThere was a dress code, you didn't adhere to it. They wanted to dress up for those pictures and that was part of the good time everyone wanted to have at the party. Of course they don't want you in the pictures if you're actively going against the theme.  \n\n\nYTA.", "YTA. \n\nYou fundamentally do not understand how dress codes work. Dress codes are an important part of etiquette which is the governance of the consideration of others. You were completely inconsiderate and insulted your host. \n\nThe polite thing to do would have been to RSVP no.", "Wow YTA. There are ways to dress semi formal and still be comfortable. OP wanted to make a statement and they have. The consequence is that they are now seen as an AH.", "You were told to dress up, you didn\u2019t. Everyone else was dressed properly as told. You can\u2019t get upset about something because YOU decided not to follow dress code. YTA.", "YTA. The edits don\u2019t help.", "YTA. How one dresses shows respect, or lack of it, for others, and for the occasion. When you\u2019ve been specifically *told* to dress up, and don\u2019t, you\u2019re being incredibly rude. Sorry. You don\u2019t sound like a bad person, just one who hasn\u2019t clued into this yet.", ">or those of you saying there was a dress code, there wasn't, the birthday girl just wanted people to dress semi-formal, but this wasn't enforced. \n\nWhat do you think a dress code is? Noone hires a special dress code police presence to kick you out, one just looks like a dick if they don't try and meet the dress code more or less (with being overdressed  generally considered OK because it's still showing you value the event)  \n\n\nYou reached out to her MORE THAN ONCE and she made clear she was not OK with jeans and a tshirt. You couldnt' add a linen blazer or something and some timberlands or some kind of version of elevating your outfit? Pft. You tried SO HARD to prove some kind of \"principled\" point but just came off a major AH and on top if it had the nerve to be offended that people were taking a 2nd picture without you in it   \n\n\nLOL the audacity. You're entitled, obnoxious and a bad friend. YTA", "YTA\n\nThe party wasn't about you or for you.  You shouldn't have gone, but since you have main character syndrome, you did.  And they did take pictures with you.  It's just that those aren't the ones that will get posted and it's their right to do that.", "YTA for your weird edits. Only person who was acting entitled is you.", "Looking at your edit... The other guests had fun dressing up. They had fun putting on their nice semiformal clothing and doing their hair and/or makeup and being around a bunch of other people in similar attire. I guarantee all those people have had fun in jeans and a t shirt. But that wasn't the kind of fun they wanted to have that night. \n\nIf dressing up like that isn't fun for you, you should decline such invites. You don't enjoy the same things they do. But showing up in casual attire to a semi-formal event is being rude - you basically were trying to tell them they're wrong for enjoying something you didn't. They're not wrong for enjoying dressing up. You're not wrong for not enjoying it. But you were wrong for trying to turn their fun event into something you would enjoy instead.", "Yta. Can you play the victim card any harder.", "I had a friend who is exactly like you.. YTA ..note the past tense on my friend, she's barely an acquaintance now. Your behaviour is entitled and will lose you friends, promotions etc because unfortunately there's a dress code to succeed in life", "YTA. You sound like a miserable person. Don\u2019t worry you won\u2019t be getting any more courtesy invites to parties", "YTA. Her party, her rules. But no, you're an exception, because you decided you are.", "Hey, I was like you once. I get it, but sometimes dressing up is a fun thing to do, you can be a tomboy and still... look nice?? And the birthday girl sound very accomodating by not forcing you into a dress, or even revoking the invite. Especially when your intentions were clear to disregard her wishes! \n\nIf you are going to die on this hill of not dressing up, keep your dignity and don't get butt hurt when you are excluded from pictures. \n\nYou could have thrown something nice together, maybe even gone thrifting for a new outfit, idk your financial situation. You also could have not shown up, instead you chose to set yourself up to have your feelings hurt. \n\nI hope you learn and grow from this, but YTA", "YTA. Her party her rules even if you or I don't agree with them. I am also a tomboy who hates dresses and skirts. You could have negotiated and asked her to let you wear a polo top and black pants since suits can be quite expensive.", "Maybe it was a courtesy invite because they were giving you a chance.", "YTA Now, I think a dress code for a birthday party is fucking stupid...but you know what I would've done? Stayed home! Not gone and whined that I wasn't allowed in pictures (another fucking stupid thing, btw).", "OP, you, like ALL of us, are going to have many, many occasions in your life that will ask you to dress up. We won\u2019t always like it, sometimes we actively hate it. But because we respect the occasion and/or the people hosting, we do what is asked.\n\nIf you cannot show that respect, don\u2019t attend. But this might be a good time in your life to figure out what you can wear to graduations, weddings, birthdays, and other dressy moments to avoid this happening again. Because you can\u2019t skip them all, and you would *always* be TA by showing up in jeans and a t-shirt.", "Plus, her only example of being left out was that people weren\u2019t asking her to be in pictures. If they\u2019d all turned their backs and refused to talk to her I\u2019m sure she would have mentioned it. She apparently got sad and left just because of the picture thing.", "The birthday girl only ok\u2019ed it after OP insisted numerous times, and clearly wasn\u2019t happy about it.", "What are you the fun police?", "The birthday girl likes dressing up. It makes her happy to have her friends dress up. Is that silly? I don\u2019t know, doesn\u2019t really matter though, it makes her happy and doesn\u2019t harm anyone.\n\nSo for her birthday, one time where it is about her, she made the easily accomplished request that her friends dress up. And OP couldn\u2019t do that, couldn\u2019t let the birthday girl have this one thing because\u2026well that\u2019s the thing, she could\u2019ve done it, this small thing to make the birthday girl happy.", "the edits made me \\*eep\\* . OP is clueless at 21 years old. Tomboy or not, OP can't understand what a dress code means and ... yes, there was. and yes, it was enforced (by ice-ing OP out).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and I also wasn't too keen on the idea of someone thinking that their birthday gives them the right to control people down to what they wear, so I told her that I would not be dressing up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But the birthday girl and her guests would have continued feeling entitled to control how people dress that way and I was hoping to show them that we can still have fun when people dress how they're comfortable and that clothes are really no big deal.\n\nomg. \\*cringe\\* If it's a request for a party that birthday girl wants and it's \"no big deal\", why not conform (conformity isn't a bad thing, it's being respectful)? It's no big deal right?

Lip gloss and a bun if she actually wanted to put in a bit of effort or a suit.", "Right?! Nobody is demanding corsets or stilettos or miniskirts. There are so many perfectly comfortable, elegant options for anyone\u2019s personal style.", "Yup like those polyblend black knitted pants, cotton Lycra I think. Palazzo pants or any other wide legged version of slacks in black cotton lycra would have counted as semi formal. It looks nice and is more comfortable than denim. Then a white fitted cotton v neck or comfy flowy blouse would have worked with some flats, booties, or doc martins.", "Seems like they're already pretty thin if this was a courtesy invite.", "OP, you should have said yes to the dress", "I got that vibe too. There are so many other choices for nice that aren't dresses.\n\nBut you know OP has be different than \"the other girls\" she's a \"tomboy\" like I'm sorry are we 12? Put on some nice pants and fancy top and have a good time.", "They don't know her. Why would they take a bunch of pictures with her?", "furthermore they thought it was a hill to die on. \"the birthday girl and her guests would have continued feeling entitled to control how people dress\" the hell? lmao", "They actually included them in pics. \n\nWhat else you want? Really.", "Yeah,  as a person who IS on the spectrum,  I have no problem understanding what a dress code is and how it functions.  In fact,  I love when rules are put in place because they give me a guideline for what's acceptable and take a lot of the guesswork out of social situations. I think Op is just an ass.", "Same, I *love* clearly communicated expectations"]}
