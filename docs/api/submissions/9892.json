We have 2 kids (6 & 4).  Both of us have a history of drug abuse and mental illness.  I have been clean for 6-years.  Stopped everything cold turkey the day we found out my ex was pregnant.  My ex stayed clean with me through her pregnancy and for about a year after that.  But she relapsed and struggled for about a year.  When we found out she was pregnant again, she cleaned up again.  But relapsed again about a year after our youngest was born.  \n\nWe tried to work through all of it together and with the help of professionals (Ex went to inpatient for 3 months after her second relapse and we tried counseling).  It became clear that we just weren't going to work and we made the mutual decision to break up.  We also decided to not involve the courts in a custody situation and try to make it work on our own (which, looking back, was very dumb and naive).   \n\nHowever, I started to notice some things that concerned me.  My ex moved back in with her parents after we broke up.  There were a handful of times when I would go to pick up the kids and my ex wouldn't be there.  Her mom or dad was always there, but when I asked where my ex was, they kept dropping names of people we used to hang out with a lot when we were using.  \n\nI confronted my ex about this once and she got very defensive.  She claimed she was still clean and was just hanging out with friends when she needs a break from the kids and that her parents are always with them if she isn't.  \n\nThen, one night I went to get the kids and my ex's dad told me that he hadn't heard from my ex in almost 24 hours.  That sent up a huge red flag. Even though my ex turned up later that night, I ended up contacting a lawyer the next day and started working on a custody suit.  I told him I want full custody.  I told him everything about my ex's drug use and relapses and also her current behavior.  Of course, I had no proof she was using again, but all the signs were there.  \n\nAt our first hearing, both my ex and I were ordered to do drug tests.  I passed, she didn't.  I was eventually awarded full custody and my ex was ordered to rehab again.  I've been allowing my ex's parents to visit us and the kids since they are good people and the kids love them.  \n\nHer mom told me that my ex is directing all of her anger towards me and is struggling with the concept of losing her kids.  Her mom knows this is projection on her daughter's part and feels I did the right thing, but she also wishes there was another way than how it went down.\n\nI've been contacted by many of my ex's friends calling me a huge AH for taking the kids away from their mother and claiming that I \"ambushed\" my ex with a drug test in order to get her sent to rehab again so I could take the kids from her.  I get dirty looks and name calling from them if I see them around town.  \n\nI'm thinking of moving with the kids to get a fresh start, but that involves legal issues too.", "created_utc": 1676326994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111lwu5/aita_for_bringing_up_my_exs_checkered_past_during/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There\u2019s a reason people using substances often lose custody of their children - and the fact that she was gone for 24+ hours without checking in is a big part of it. \n\nYou sound like a great dad, and congrats on 6 years clean.", "NTA.

And while your ex is the most dedicated mother she can be, she will always be equally dedicated to using until she's clean. \nYou took the legal route and it makes sense, you need those orders in place to protect your kids. \n\nHaving said that, your ex deserves the chance to do the work and see her kids.

I hope she can get and stay clean for the kids, but you need to do what us best for them.", "NTA. Someone in active addiction can't take care of kids. As you seem to know, relapse is a process that starts with picking up old behaviours, which is what got you suspicious in the first place. \nBeing around someone in active is very destructive for kids as they both get accustomed to the use around them, as well as pick up horrible coping mechanisms along the way (their parent is the one who should be teaching them the correct ones).\nPeople around addicts in active, often make the mistake that keeping the circumstances as cosy as possible will make the addict want to become clean. I think that's what the people calling you are thinking about. This more often than not, is not the case. \nPlus, most importantly: this is about the kids. They need a safe environment.

Bottom line you are making sure the kids have access to their grandparents.   You are their dad and the most appropriate person to raise them.   Congratulations on continuing to overcome the addiction and I know it\u2019s an ongoing battle.  One of the very hardest things to accomplish.   Moving away would make it more difficult for the kids to see their grands.  That connection is lovely. Children cannot have too much love.   Perhaps just block all of her loser friends.   Their opinions don\u2019t count for much but if they make you feel badly well then make sure you don\u2019t hear or see anything from them.", "NTA at all but be cautious about moving.

Can you block your ex's friends' numbers so at least they can't contact you directly?", "NTA.\n\nYou did what is right for the kids, not your ex's feelings.\n\nHer friends seem to be more on the enabling side if they are encouraging her in this delusion of ambush, etc.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't \"take\" the kids away from their mother, their mother lost the kids by continuing her drug use.  You didn't do one thing to be selfish or vengeful, you took proper action to protect your kids.\n\nYou did the right thing in sharing the truth with the court.  The drug test was vital to determining what was best for your kids.  They deserve the best.\n\nHold your head high when you run into people who think you should have let an addict endanger your kids.\n\nAnd if the courts will let you move, maybe this would be a good idea. -- although it does sound as if the children have a good relationship with their grandparents, and it would be nice if this could continue, particularly in the absence of a reliable mother.", "NTA.  Protect your kids, that's what's important.  If you ex finally gets clean long term, that's a bonus.  Losing her kids may be the rock bottom she needs.", "NTA. The only important thing here is that your kids are safe and not getting exposed to drugs.", "NTA. \n\nKids come first.", "NTA.  All of your ex's flying monkeys can take a hike too. A drug addict can not take care of children, no matter how much they try and claim they can. You are doing what's best for yourself and you kids, end of. Good luck, OP, looks like you're gonna need it.", "NTA. You are protecting your children. Nothing else matters more than that, including your ex's feelings. Moving away seems harsh since it removes the kids from their grandparents, but if it's what you have to do, then do it. I hope your ex manages to get sober and that it finally sticks.
