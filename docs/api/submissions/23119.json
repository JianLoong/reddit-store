The guy is dating you from age 19 to 34 and you're supposed to wait while he gets to his magically \"ready\" moment. The decision to get married shouldn't be a surprise- it should come from a thoughtful series of discussions between two equals. He told you some years ago that marriage was something he saw in your future but then left you hanging. I would leave him and start dating.

You\u2019re perfectly entitled to end the relationship because you\u2019re hurt, but he is not an asshole for saying no.

You almost did this to yourself.\n\nHe's an even bigger TA. He clearly has some intense control issues and he has retrograde sexist views and is insecure enough in his masculinity that he's held on to these views even in his 30s and through a 15 year relationship. He is so insecure that he opted for humilliating you and breaking your heart in public instead of overcoming it. Like, he could have said \"yes\" and then postponed setting a date indefinitely, lol. And now he is diminishing your pain. And passive-aggressively controling you by refusing to consider setting some timeline where you can both get what you want. Yeeeshk! \n\nYou two suck as a couple. How have you been together for 15 freakin' years and not come to a consensus? I think it's telling that he believes he's the one that should propose and he hasn't in all this time, knowing you want to get married. If he's not ready now, face it, he never will be. \n\nAt this point, I think you should flee. Even if he does eventually propose (which will likely not be in the way you would want), he will look for other ways to be in control. And this can't be the only sexist, retrograde view he holds.

You could\u2019ve communicated more and asked him more about it, and tried to get him to change his mind or get him to propose to you, instead you do this. You backed him into a corner and when he said no you break up with him, sure the decent thing would\u2019ve been to say yes, but he didn\u2019t want that and you knew it, and it\u2019s not like he could\u2019ve taken you to the side and say no after because you had his whole family there.

In a similar way to a woman imagining her wedding dress (though typically from an older age).\n\nFor a responsible and mature man to propose there is typically societal pressure in a number of different ways;\n\n1. Being able to buy the ring.\n2. Being financially responsible and ready to be a husband.\n3. Being mature enough to be a husband \n4. Being able to perform the proposal in a manner that they'd like.\n\nObviously this list exhaustive.  Guys often aren't praised about who they are so it can be common for some guys to just think they're not yet worthy, mature enough, earning enough or a bunch of other reasons.\n\nWhen it comes to the wedding process, proposing is also the one area where typically it's down to us guys to arrange, plan and execute.  A lot of guys would find it upsetting to have this taken away from them, imagine getting married but having someone else choosing your wedding dress for you without any fittings.", "Hmmmm, I can go both ways on this.\n\nI don't think you're the AH for proposing...  after all, we're in the 21st century and supposedly have equal rights.\n\nThat said, we see a lot of posts about how the woman has a certain place/time/etc. for her proposal, and the BF botches it because he didn't listen.  Redditors will crucify the guy for not listening to her.  So, this really sounds like the same thing, just with the genders reversed.  You could have handled it better by starting to raise the question of when does he plan to propose, etc., then let him have his dream proposal.\n\nThat said, if you've been together so long and everything is supposedly great, don't throw it all away due to a botched proposal.

It could be for many reasons.\n\n1) You said or did something that gave him doubts\n\n2) He doesn't believe in marriage at all\n\n3) You're a placeholder until he finds a girl he actually wants\n\n4) He never liked you to begin with\n\nPersonally I think it's 3 or 4.", "Would say ESH, you knew he wanted to do it and that he believed a girl should not propose to a guy, you still jumped the gun and since obviously you knew he opposed you proposing to him (Think this makes him an ass btw) was wrong.\n\nI think its mild y-t-a for jumping him but when he said no, you should have given him a month or something (not long in a 15 year relationship) to do it his way before you completely ghosted him. \n\nAgain, think your proposal was very cute its just that you knew that it was not something he wanted, you could have given him a (short) chance to refuse and do it his way. \n\nOf course with his old views the perfect thing would have been him saying no, garbing the ring and then counter proposing but who knows, it could have happened a week or a month down the road but you closed the door on both that and some communication.", "ESH- I\u2019m surprised more people are telling you that it was an AH move to propose in such a public setting. If this was a man who proposed in public to a woman everyone would be calling him the AH. He also communicated to you that he wouldn\u2019t say yes if you proposed by telling you he didn\u2019t think women should propose to men. So you knew what his answer would be but still proposed to him in public? For all of those reasons you are the AH. \n\nNow he\u2019s the AH for dragging this out for 15 years. It does not take 15 years to decide you want to marry someone. He never intended on marrying you. He was keeping his options open and string ing you along.", "NTA.

I\u2019m sorry for being so blunt because I know you\u2019re heart broken but\u2026he\u2019s proven over and over again. He\u2019s shown you who he is. Believe him and leave him behind.", "NTA.

You shouldn\u2019t have sprung this on him. Especially since you knew he would not like it at all. You should\u2019ve had the conversation and sId hey, I\u2019m approaching the fork on the road regarding this relationship.

But you also knew that he would not want to be proposed to but did it anyway. I\u2019m so sorry that happened, but it seems to me you\u2019ve been led on, made a life with this guy thinking he was going to propose, waiting for something that was never going to happen. \u2026 and here he was getting all the benefits of marriage without a marriage. But you allowed it. Communication was key here. I\u2019d have been out after a couple years\u2026 especially if I wanted something different, married and a family and he didn\u2019t.. you have to obtain your goals on your own not wait in someone for 15 years to give it to you under the guise of he \u201cmight \u201c propose. Some people don\u2019t want to get married and that\u2019s perfectly okay, but again, a discussion was definitely in order here.. and you should have been told a direct answer that he had no intention of ever asking you instead of leading you on for all those years.

Even couples who 'surprise' each other know that they're going to get married, just not the exact details of when/where/how.\n\nHim - I'm baffled that (a) he would reject you and give any reason other than not wanting to marry you; and (b) after a rejecting your proposal that he would be so callous to think that he didn't owe you reasonably detailed conversation about when/if you will get married. \n\nIt it's any consolation, I think you did the right thing. A person who rejects their partner of 15 years and leaves them crying and distraught with only a non-committal \"wait and find out\" is going to continue to cause you more pain.", "This sucks. I\u2019m so so sorry. Lot of my friends have been in your shoes. They believed a man that told them to wait knowing he would never propose. Leave, don\u2019t look back. Don\u2019t give him another day.", "ESH\n\nYou, mostly for two things:\n\nFirst, you did it in a public place and by your own description made a bit of a scene when he said no. Public proposals are a TERRIBLE idea unless the other person is into that, and you KNOW what their answer is going to be. Otherwise you're putting them on the spot and uncomfortable and creating the potential for a rather upsetting response.\n\nAnd that leads to the second point... it doesn't seem like you've actually talked to him about marriage at all recently. A conversation 10+ years ago really should have been revisited recently and given a serious discussion. It sounds like his attitudes on gender roles haven't changed, and he's not ready for marriage still. You just assumed a whole lot instead of talking.\n\nNow, he sucks for his absurd attitude \"Men have to propose\" as well as his \"I'm not ready yet\" thing still going on. It's been 15 years, he's either ready, or he never will be and he needs to own that and say it. He's also an AH for calling you dramatic (even if you were)... he seems to lack some basic empathy if he can't understand why you'd be upset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou also went nuclear in that moment and from your telling didn't even try and have a real conversation afterwards (a phone call before he has to go to work doesn't cut it) before taking your stuff, leaving, ending the relationship and blocking him everywhere. I feel like there are a lot of other things going on outside of this story if this moment led to this immediate response.", "YTA because he wanted the proposal to be done in a certain way and you ignored it. Men are also allowed to want certain things in a proposal.\n\nNTA for breaking up with him because it has been 15 years", "ESH. Yes, his views about proposals are outdated and gross. But this could have been resolved with a discussion beforehand. If you wanted to propose, you could have brought it up to him, let him know he could do a public proposal to feed his ego, and maybe you could also propose, either publicly or privately. Or just tell him you were done waiting for a proposal because you were ready to move on to the next step and planned accordingly. You knew how he felt about proposals, even if you brushed it off. Him sticking to his guns and turning you down is still shitty, because getting married shouldn't be a no just because he didn't get to propose how he wanted if he really loves you, and calling you dramatic and not giving you an answer about being ready-- 15 years is a very long time to wait.\n\nI hope you are able to move on and find someone much better.", "NTA \n\n15 years and he still hasn\u2019t proposed? How is he still \u201cnot ready\u201d.\n\nDon\u2019t feel like you have wasted time, know that you learned from this relationship and that you had good memories\u2026 but time for you to break up and move on.", "NTA. \n\nThis is the right answer. He knew you wanted to get married, and he said that he saw it happening \"sometime down the road.\" And then FIFTEEN years passed? He was never going to propose to you. \n\nHe also sounds like he has control issues. Telling you that you aren't *allowed* to propose because he wants to do it -- when he clearly had no intention of doing so -- is telling you that he wants to have the permanent upper hand in your relationship.", "yup all of this!", "I honestly don\u2019t think he ever intended to propose to her.

And in those 10 years never had it been discussed again.. maybe a little conversation about it..? Communication?

We have other civil contracts that provide more or less the same protection as marriage. It\u2019s called PACS. same advantages than marriage for taxes.\nThe only differences I see:\n- inheritance: it\u2019s more complex to have your partner inherit your property than marriage. Not an issue for us as he have only one child and we agreed she would\nInherit as marriage it would be more tax efficient\n- retirement: if you are under a certain level of pension, your husband/wife can benefit from part of your pension after your death. We are above the limit so no difference for us until the rules change.\n\nMarriage has absolutely no significance for him, and for me the spiritual commitment is only worth it if it\u2019s shared. He\u2019s an atheist and I\u2019m agnostic so no religious criteria in this decision.\nAnd after many years, I r\u00e9alise that a wedding can be stressful and expensive (nothing to gain for us here), and divorces are often ugly (and frankly, unending in France when it takes years to get one).\n\nSo for me, no reason to get married, and I don\u2019t want to jeopardize something good for something that cannot make it better anyway. If I really wanted it, we would have married but he wouldn\u2019t mean anything to him (he would just do it for me)\n\nConcerning your situation, if the only reasons to get married were the ones you listed (administrative reasons), you would have married earlier, or you wouldn\u2019t react so strongly.\nIf you really need this, you need to be able to explain your reasons. Maybe it would make him change his mind if he understood. I suppose he is wondering why it just became so critical right new after 15 years. \nDo not forget that you might end up splitting because you want to get married when everything was working well before.", "Yea I'm not basing it off that. \n\nI'm saying OP put in the title he said no because I'm a girl.  Than no where in the post does he say that. Yes he's stringing her along , yes he probably never want to get married. \n\nBut this has nothing to do with her proposing as a girl.

You had fifteen years together, you talked about it often, and he just kept brushing the topic off? He was never going to propose. \n\nIf he didn't want to get married, he should have just said so. Then you could make an honest choice about whether to stay or go. But saying that he would propose soon, and then stringing you along for years is a massive jerk move. \n\nAnd saying that you weren't \"allowed\" to propose?

Considering this, it feels more so like you enlisted parents and friends for pressure because you knew you were on shaky ground. Still, sorry he wasted so much of your time by not being transparent.\n\nEDIT: You should add the fact that you brought up the conversation many times over the years to your OP.
