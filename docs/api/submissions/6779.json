It\u2019s his responsibility to fix his problems. You have every right to say no. \n\n2) There are many, many more ways to make money than to sell someone\u2019s hair. If he needs to earn money quickly he could look for other alternatives instead of taking the one quickest easiest and painless (for him) approach.  It\u2019s also very clear he expects all the ladies in the family to suffer and bail him out of his circumstances but he\u2019s made 0 efforts to find alternatives that put him out, as he should be. \n\n3) he is emotionally abusing you and your mom and sister by trying to manipulate you into doing his will.

He made the conscious choice to go to the casino. He made the conscious effort to take forms of payment with him that would allow him to gamble more than he should.
