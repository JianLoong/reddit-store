Jesus Christ, fuck your dad, consider not returning to this home if you can avoid it in the future,", "NTA, I find it really disturbing that he even thinks about sellings his wife's and daughters's hair to get money. It's your hair, you get to decide if you want to cut them or not.", "NTA.  But, although you can make money, you aren\u2019t likely to get *that* much money. It looks like a lot of sites are scams.  Your father is awful.", "NTA, stay far far away.\n\nI was worried this was was going to end with him shearing you like a sheep while you were asleep.", "NTA.\n\nYour household needs its own reality series, but definitely NTA.", "NTA - This is a stupid solution to a problem he created. And a temporary one. He\u2019ll still be 18K in debt, what does he expect to do for next rent, or utilities, or groceries? This also is not your responsibility. Your dad made bad choices and now he needs to deal with the consequences. He needs to find a way to make rent and build back *his own* debt, not put that burden on you and *guilt you* for it as if it\u2019s your fault. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s his.\n\nIf this is how your dad approached this a week after the fact, then it wasn\u2019t the drinks that led him to the stupid decisions. It seems like that\u2019s just his way of life. You\u2019re better off walking away from that.", "NTA, NTA! It is not your stepmom's, younger sister's, or your responsibility to give your dad your hair. He saw something in the home that could be sold for money and decided it was your family obligation to sell it. Classic addiction and gambling behavior! This possessiveness over you and the other women in the family is abusive because it pulls on your genuine needs (shelter) and desires to help each other, and your natural desire for your stepmom and sister not to feel obligated to cut their hair. Go back to school, shake out that beautiful long mane of yours, and don't ever let anyone shame you or threaten you into helping them get out of a corner they painted themselves into.", "WTF?!?! NTA \n\nWhat better way to get eliminated from his daughter's life and her wedding, future babies...\n\nHe is a work of art. Sorry OP", "NTA - he made a stupid decision and it\u2019s not your responsibility to fix it", "NTA - your father is responsible for his own actions here. Selling your hair to cover his mistake is not him finding a way forward, just going an easy route instead of doing the work to fix it. \nAs a side note, this doesn\u2019t just happen and I would be wary of his behavior.", "NTA.\nHe played stupid games and didn't win a prize. He's a grown up and needs to figure this problem out himself.", "I\u2019m sorry, what - $20K or $2K was lost here\u2026?

Your dad needs to man up and fix his own problems. His words sound like that of an addict. I have a feeling his gambling problem is worse than visible on the surface. Asking you to cut your hair is just the beginning. The only thing I would cut is my relationship with him. And make sure you let him know you're cutting ties until he gets his poop in a group.", "NTA. No discussion.", "NTA. Holy shit. Your dad got his own self info this mess. It's not on you to save him! Your dad likes bets? He can bet on you deciding to go no contact with him. It would serve him right.", "NTA, your dad is, wow! The nerve he has to ask his kid to fix his problems, he\u2019s a little old to know better. Don\u2019t let him shame you to cut your hair for his wrong doings, let him suffer his consequences. I\u2019m sure neither your step mom or sister will allow their hair to be shaven off, he can get another job. You did right by leaving. Keep yourself away from this type of toxic environment. Best of luck to your sister and you too.", "NTA. I hope your dad eventually apologizes to you for trying to bully you like that. I'd stay away until he does apologize, and make your stepmom and sister understand why they don't see you over there anymore.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry, OP. He never should have even asked you in the first place. Hopefully when he\u2019s sober he realizes what an absolute ass he was", "NTA, not your issue.  Not your step mom and sisters issue either.  However, I seriously doubt this is the first time he has gambled away large sums of money.

Still it isn\u2019t your responsibility and if you did give him your hair it would probably start a cycle where you would always be bailing him out.", "NTA \n\nWhat in the world did I just read?! He put himself into this situation by irresponsibly gambling and then expected you to get him out of it by cutting all of your hair off\u2026 There\u2019s so much wrong here I\u2019m not sure where to start, but one thing is for sure, you did the right thing by leaving.", "NTA, he made a really bad decision and is now bullying you into helping him fix it. It is his problem though, if you wanted to help, that should be your choice, not because of an ultimatum.", "NTA. But be careful, I wouldn\u2019t stay with him if I were you or you\u2019ll wake up with a shaved head.", "100% NTA.  \n\nHe needs serious help for his gambling addiction. Manipulating his own daughter into helping pay off his (TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR??) debt is beyond insane. Trying to make you feel bad about it, like it\u2019s at all your fault, is even worse. \n\nYour body your choice. No one can make you do anything to your body for them.", "nta. Why is your hair less important than your stepmom or sis?\n\nIt's his fault not yours. He should be mad at himself, not you.", "leave.  obviously nta", "NTA. What a guy - making his stupid mistake your responsibility. Leaving was absolutely the right thing, and you'll need to stay away because this isn't going to end any time soon.", "Wtf is wrong with ur dad", "INFO: how old is your sister?
