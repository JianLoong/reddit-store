Loud noises in general terrify her, and none more so than hand dryers. For this reason, public bathrooms have always been a challenge, and it's something I have to take into account whenever we leave the house.\n\nAnyway, Ivy likes stories, so we often go to the local library to read books together. The bathrooms there have a hand dryer, but also a paper towel dispenser. Whenever she needs the bathroom while we are there, I go with her, and politely ask anyone who comes in if they'd mind using the paper towels instead of the hand dryer because the noise really scares my kid. People tend to be nice and this has never been a problem for anyone.  However, yesterday a woman came in to wash her hands, and when I asked her, she rolled her eyes at me and just blatantly told me no. Ivy, who was already on the toilet, overhead and started panicking and tried to leave the bathroom, but she was too late. The woman turns on the hand dryer, and Ivy was so upset that she started hyperventilating, and I had to escort her out and it took a while to calm her down. The woman passed by us at some point and rolled her eyes again, told me that I am not doing my daughter any favours and that she is old enough to learn to deal. I was so shocked I had no response other than telling her to get out.\n\nI felt she was way out of line, but my husband agrees a little and thinks I should not expect the world to accommodate Ivy, and that it was a bit entitled of me to ask. It's such a small thing though, and I never imagined it could be an inconvenience to anyone, or I would not have asked. Paper towels are more hygienic anyway. Of course I know Ivy has to work on this fear, but the world is already asking so much of her at the moment. I want her to tackle it in her own time.\n\nIvy now says she never wants to go to the library again. I hate that this safe space has been taken away from her. AITA?\n\nEdit: I've been trying to keep up with the comments, and I think you (and my husband) are right: I have not handled this well, and I should not have relied on others to accommodate Ivy. But this is difficult for me. See, the whole world is just such an inhospitable place to Ivy. She is five years old, and nothing has been easy for her. She has sensory issues, but also motor difficulties, gastrointestinal issues, other nightmares and irrational fears, a language delay, social emotional challenges, and more. Everything is a struggle. Most of these things I cannot shield her from, and she has to face them, and she has to fight, and she has to cope every day. Her paralyzing fear of hand dryers is almost a minor thing in comparison, they're generally easy to avoid (we only use the library bathroom because we know there's the paper towel option there - otherwise there's usually a disabled toilet, or we just don't go - Ivy doesn't like a lot of public places anyway), something I thought we could just park for a while. Yes, a part of me felt like the world should do this one thing for her, in one of the few places she feels happy aside from her own room, because I see how hard she works to adjust. A part of me still feels like that, because, you know, I'm a parent, and if I could change the world for her, I would. But you've all made me realise this is not fair: not to Ivy, and not to everyone else who has their own life to live, and their own fights to fight. I'm going to explore if noise cancelling headphones are an option for her. She also does not like things on her head, so I am not sure if this really is the easy fix we have been looking for, but it's definitely an avenue to explore. Thank you.

He knows how to put TP over the sensor to turn off the auto flush. Teaching him this control has helped him feel more confident in managing his own experiences and he is proud of himself. This is what OT and his pediatrician recommended too. It is VERY important to give all kids the tools to be as autonomous as possible.

Our approach has been to teach our kids how to accommodate their needs by wearing noise canceling devices in scenarios with loud noises. They no longer have anxiety over loud noise situations, they reach for noise canceling instead. \n\nAnd to anyone who thinks a kid should tough it out and will get used to it, as the bathroom lady said, all I can say is that's how I grew up, suffering through the pain of it, and no, it didn't lesson.

I would just take them out and use sanitary gel, although that doesn't fix other people using them. I have to say, I never asked people not to use the air dryers.\n\nStill, you can ask, but be ready when they say no. \n\nI do think you're going to have to find a way to get her past this, whether that's counseling or noise blockers or a combination.

Maybe you can even find a time to go in the bathroom and let her start the dryer herself; the control of it might help her get adjusted.\n\nAs for paper towels being more hygienic, I don't know if that's true. I know studies have been done showing that virus-infected water got splattered around from those dryers, but I think that's misleading. Most people are putting washed, or at least rinsed, hands in/under those dryers. No one is dipping their hand in dirty, virus-tainted water and then drying their hands to spread it around.

She needs to be able to cope on her own for those days when helpers aren't around.  And her life will be so much richer for it.
