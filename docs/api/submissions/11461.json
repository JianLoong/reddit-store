The bathrooms there have a hand dryer, but also a paper towel dispenser. Whenever she needs the bathroom while we are there, I go with her, and politely ask anyone who comes in if they'd mind using the paper towels instead of the hand dryer because the noise really scares my kid. People tend to be nice and this has never been a problem for anyone.  However, yesterday a woman came in to wash her hands, and when I asked her, she rolled her eyes at me and just blatantly told me no. Ivy, who was already on the toilet, overhead and started panicking and tried to leave the bathroom, but she was too late. The woman turns on the hand dryer, and Ivy was so upset that she started hyperventilating, and I had to escort her out and it took a while to calm her down. The woman passed by us at some point and rolled her eyes again, told me that I am not doing my daughter any favours and that she is old enough to learn to deal.

Of course I know Ivy has to work on this fear, but the world is already asking so much of her at the moment.

You're asking strangers to change their behaviour to suit you.\n\nBut somehow you just refuse to acknowledge that anyone could want to use a hand dryer... and if they do... which they don't... then they *shouldn't* like them.... so they should still listen to you.

He knows how to put TP over the sensor to turn off the auto flush. Teaching him this control has helped him feel more confident in managing his own experiences and he is proud of himself. This is what OT and his pediatrician recommended too. It is VERY important to give all kids the tools to be as autonomous as possible.

That would accommodate her needs and you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about asking people not to use dryer.", "Nah. You have the right to ask and they have the right to say no.

I am autistic & so are my children. We all have had similar sensory issues, and public bathrooms have been a lifelong battle, so I understand this very well. I've never asked others not to use the dryer (though see nothing wrong with asking). Our approach has been to teach our kids how to accommodate their needs by wearing noise canceling devices in scenarios with loud noises. They no longer have anxiety over loud noise situations, they reach for noise canceling instead. \n\nAnd to anyone who thinks a kid should tough it out and will get used to it, as the bathroom lady said, all I can say is that's how I grew up, suffering through the pain of it, and no, it didn't lesson. I use noise canceling now too & it's changed my life for the better.", "NAH, but you need to buy her some noise cancelling headphones or something.

Yes, but she was allowed to use the hand dryer if she wanted to, it is a public bathroom, and chances are there will be more times when people will ignore your request in the future.\n\nYou need to prepare your daughter for this, instead of constantly asking others to never make any loud sounds next to her, the world is a very noisy place after all.", "ESH.\nI'm kind of surprised having a daughter with asd you're not aware of how many ppl especially with asd have sensory issues with certain textures.

In this situation depending on how much drama it looked like I'd either do a paper pat without folding the paper/getting it between my fingers which doesn't really get my hands properly dry, ask how long she'd be or just leave the bathroom with wet hands.

Both of my kids hated air dryers in public bathrooms when they were little. I don't think they mind them so much now -- although one of them doesn't like using public bathrooms in the first place at all -- but that noise can be scary. I would just take them out and use sanitary gel, although that doesn't fix other people using them. I have to say, I never asked people not to use the air dryers.\n\nStill, you can ask, but be ready when they say no. \n\nI do think you're going to have to find a way to get her past this, whether that's counseling or noise blockers or a combination. And she may grow out of it like my kids did. Maybe you can even find a time to go in the bathroom and let her start the dryer herself; the control of it might help her get adjusted.\n\nAs for paper towels being more hygienic, I don't know if that's true. I know studies have been done showing that virus-infected water got splattered around from those dryers, but I think that's misleading. Most people are putting washed, or at least rinsed, hands in/under those dryers. No one is dipping their hand in dirty, virus-tainted water and then drying their hands to spread it around.

I went to an audiologist to get custom sleeves for my in-ear monitors, but the molds are now too old to get custom earplugs. The Loop earplugs look great and are WAY cheaper! I still want custom, but something like Loop will definitely keep me happy in the meantime.", "I\u2019m struggling with how paper towels can be more hygienic.", "I think this is the best response.", "^^^ This OP ^^^\n\nMight I suggest you get noise cancelling head phones for your daughter to wear when she needs to use public restrooms? It worked for the son of friends of mine who had similar issues with the noises in public bathrooms when he was young. They also worked for watching fireworks displays without getting the loud booms.", "I think this is the best take. Also it's possible that you run into someone that has different special needs and can't use a paper towel. The daughter needs therapy- it still may take her time to get past this but therapy should help!", "I disagree that the other woman was an AH.\n\nWe don't know other people's lives. She might have skin sensitivities that make it uncomfortable to use industrial-type paper towels.", "I am inclined to agree here. Sadly society isn't going to be full of nice people who will modify their behaviour to accommodate your kid's needs (and in some cases, some may not be able to).\n\nIt feels like you should set your kid up for success here. Maybe provide some noise cancelling headphones to reduce startling noises.", "You rarely experience loud noises in a library- hence the it being a safe space for her. I doubt OP is asking people in every environment to accommodate.", "My daughter has noise sensory from ADHD. Loud trucks, motorcycles, the vacuum, Nana talking too loud. Headphones, or even covering her ears helps a lot. You can't eliminate noise from her life, but providing her the tools necessary to get through it will help her so much more. \n\nI actually get notices when there's going to be a fire alarm at school and her teachers are wonderful about grabbing a pair of headphones or holding her ears during the alarm because it will render her completely non-functioning otherwise.", "Sorry, yes, I meant ASD. I am not a native speaker, and I guess that gave me away just there.", "Yeah the woman was a huge AH but she isn't wrong, OPS daughter needs some help to work through it because she can't avoid loud noises forever she just can't and the sooner the better so at least when she is older she can handle it much better then she does now.", "The things that trigger your daughter will not always be things that you or she can control. I have no doubt that you would like her to have rich and full life experiences. To do that, you and she'll need to make adaptations to let her function in a world that doesn't always embrace people who are different. The woman you spoke to was kind of rude, but it won't be the worst thing you or your daughter will encounter. I hope it doesn't put your daughter off the library, and that you can show her that she has the power to cope with scarey things", "That added no value to this post", "Air dryers recycle the air in the bathroom, spewing air with fecal matter in it onto your hands. I believe that mythbusters did an episode about it", "https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health/hand-dryers-or-paper-towel-question", "That actually is true. \n\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-bacterial-horror-of-the-hot-air-hand-dryer-2018051113823\n\nBut still not OP's place to try and tell people how to dry their own hands.", "Agreed - top comment, so far.", "Thanks for the award! :D", "This is a great suggestion. \n\n\\*I really feel that OP isn't *actually* an AH\\* but this is a judgement thread of limited options, and I feel ESH is the most accurate of those.", "No problem at all! Just wanted to clarify because I thought it could be another disorder or syndrome that I\u2019m not familiar with :)", "I award you zero points, and may God have mercy on your soul.", "Take my poor man\u2019s medal \ud83c\udfc5 for that Billy Madison reference"]}
