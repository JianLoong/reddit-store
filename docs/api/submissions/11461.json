Loud noises in general terrify her, and none more so than hand dryers. For this reason, public bathrooms have always been a challenge, and it's something I have to take into account whenever we leave the house.\n\nAnyway, Ivy likes stories, so we often go to the local library to read books together. The bathrooms there have a hand dryer, but also a paper towel dispenser. Whenever she needs the bathroom while we are there, I go with her, and politely ask anyone who comes in if they'd mind using the paper towels instead of the hand dryer because the noise really scares my kid. People tend to be nice and this has never been a problem for anyone.  However, yesterday a woman came in to wash her hands, and when I asked her, she rolled her eyes at me and just blatantly told me no. Ivy, who was already on the toilet, overhead and started panicking and tried to leave the bathroom, but she was too late. The woman turns on the hand dryer, and Ivy was so upset that she started hyperventilating, and I had to escort her out and it took a while to calm her down. The woman passed by us at some point and rolled her eyes again, told me that I am not doing my daughter any favours and that she is old enough to learn to deal. I was so shocked I had no response other than telling her to get out.\n\nI felt she was way out of line, but my husband agrees a little and thinks I should not expect the world to accommodate Ivy, and that it was a bit entitled of me to ask. It's such a small thing though, and I never imagined it could be an inconvenience to anyone, or I would not have asked. Paper towels are more hygienic anyway. Of course I know Ivy has to work on this fear, but the world is already asking so much of her at the moment. I want her to tackle it in her own time.\n\nIvy now says she never wants to go to the library again. I hate that this safe space has been taken away from her. AITA?\n\nEdit: I've been trying to keep up with the comments, and I think you (and my husband) are right: I have not handled this well, and I should not have relied on others to accommodate Ivy. But this is difficult for me. See, the whole world is just such an inhospitable place to Ivy. She is five years old, and nothing has been easy for her. She has sensory issues, but also motor difficulties, gastrointestinal issues, other nightmares and irrational fears, a language delay, social emotional challenges, and more. Everything is a struggle. Most of these things I cannot shield her from, and she has to face them, and she has to fight, and she has to cope every day. Her paralyzing fear of hand dryers is almost a minor thing in comparison, they're generally easy to avoid (we only use the library bathroom because we know there's the paper towel option there - otherwise there's usually a disabled toilet, or we just don't go - Ivy doesn't like a lot of public places anyway), something I thought we could just park for a while. Yes, a part of me felt like the world should do this one thing for her, in one of the few places she feels happy aside from her own room, because I see how hard she works to adjust. A part of me still feels like that, because, you know, I'm a parent, and if I could change the world for her, I would. But you've all made me realise this is not fair: not to Ivy, and not to everyone else who has their own life to live, and their own fights to fight. I'm going to explore if noise cancelling headphones are an option for her. She also does not like things on her head, so I am not sure if this really is the easy fix we have been looking for, but it's definitely an avenue to explore. Thank you.

He knows how to put TP over the sensor to turn off the auto flush. Teaching him this control has helped him feel more confident in managing his own experiences and he is proud of himself. This is what OT and his pediatrician recommended too. It is VERY important to give all kids the tools to be as autonomous as possible.

They no longer have anxiety over loud noise situations, they reach for noise canceling instead. \n\nAnd to anyone who thinks a kid should tough it out and will get used to it, as the bathroom lady said, all I can say is that's how I grew up, suffering through the pain of it, and no, it didn't lesson.

I have to say, I never asked people not to use the air dryers.\n\nStill, you can ask, but be ready when they say no. \n\nI do think you're going to have to find a way to get her past this, whether that's counseling or noise blockers or a combination.

Maybe you can even find a time to go in the bathroom and let her start the dryer herself; the control of it might help her get adjusted.\n\nAs for paper towels being more hygienic, I don't know if that's true. I know studies have been done showing that virus-infected water got splattered around from those dryers, but I think that's misleading. Most people are putting washed, or at least rinsed, hands in/under those dryers. No one is dipping their hand in dirty, virus-tainted water and then drying their hands to spread it around.

She needs to be able to cope on her own for those days when helpers aren't around.  And her life will be so much richer for it.

Just wanted to chime in a few suggestions. Have you enrolled your daughter in Sensory Integration Therapy? Over time, that kind of therapy can help reduce sensitivity to loud noises.

Not all of them are created equal and you\u2019ll have to go to a place that sells them to see what works for your child. I personally like The Bose Quiet Comfort 45\u2019s. They\u2019re the best noise cancelation money can buy, and are very sensory friendly. \n\nAnother tip: I cannot stress the need for a good sensory toolkit. A sensory toolkit are items that you can give your child when she\u2019s worked up. What works for everyone is very individual, and it\u2019s really up to the person what works for them. I recommend calling Stacy\u2019s Sensory Solutions. They\u2019re located in Plano, Tx, but do a huge online business. Call their store and they should have some suggestions. Things that have helped me are: textured lap pads, fidgets I can squeeze, have textures on them, or make noises. I personally like the fidget slug, and the lollipopter. I also keep a brand of play dough that Stacy\u2019s carries. It\u2019s a fancier brand than what you buy at the store, and comes with textured toys inside. The texture of the play dough is also nicer than regular play dough. Along with play dough, I keep slime in my sensory kit. There are lots of types of slime. I like Razberry Slime Co\u2019s beach cloud cr\u00e8me slime but your daughter may like something else. It\u2019s really just trial and error. I got the slime on etsy. \n\nAlong with that, therapy brushes can be great for some people with Autism, and some children and adults with ASD have found success with Service Dogs for their disability. I know I have one, and it\u2019s been life changing. \n\nI also recommend checking out r/autism where you can connect with other people with Autism, as well as parents with Autism. \n\nAnd for the judgement, I\u2019d say NTA.

If she always has mom swooping in to stop the scary noise or force others to walk on eggshells, she really won't be able to cope when you're not there to protect her.  I agree with the noise cancelling headphones and you might talk to her doctors/therapists about some type of therapy that will help her get used to the sounds of the outside world.  As someone who grew up with undiagnosed ASD (that diagnosis didn't exist in my childhood - I was diagnosed in my 40's), I was terrified of airplanes (the noise scared me) and the outside world in general. My mother, not knowing these issues were indicative of neurodivergence, just forced me to deal with them. I still prefer to stay indoors, avoid planes, and avoid crowds of people, but I can tolerate it now (for a reasonable length of time) and every day I thank my mother for the tough love that helped me become high functioning.  I'm pretty sure if she hadn't and she'd tried to help me avoid my anxieties, fears, and sensitivities, I'd have spent my adult life disabled and unable to cope with the world.", "Take a bunch of post-it notes with you to public bathrooms and write\u201dout of service\u201d on them.

It's a really, really big deal to us, and we will put in a lot of effort to work with people to meet their needs as much as we can.\n\nAt our library, we also have ear defenders we can lend out, would something like that possibly help?\n\nAside from being a librarian, I'm also autistic, severely physically disabled, and have mental health problems (and I find the dryers a sensory nightmare too - the nice bit of being a wheelchair user is that accessible bathrooms are usually single occupancy not stalls). I don't think you were doing anything wrong, and I think that lady was way out of line - it would have cost her nothing to avoid terrifying a child, and if she really, really wanted to use the hand dryer, she could have waited.\n\nFrankly, if you'd been in my library you'd have been offered a quiet space and any assistance we could give you when we saw Ivy was upset, and if I'd heard it while it was happening I'd have turned the hand dryer off and marked it out of order (they usually have a switch on the wall somewhere. I would absolutely advise a preventative discreet \"click\" followed by \"oops, it seems to be out of order...\" in future).\n\nWe're a really small library and just have one accessible toilet for customers and one in the staff room. I've let people use ours all the time if the other one is busy, out of order, or somehow a problem. We've warmed up baby bottles, let people in to change clothes and have a wash, untangled bags of knitting, tracked down owners of various lost things, all sorts of random stuff. We like helping, it's the absolute best bit of the job. We are there to help our customers, and generally we'll bend rules into a pretzel if necessary to do so.

It's harsh but it's reality.\n\nDo look at headphones - they were a godsend to us.\n\nAlternatively you can sometimes override sensory distress by loading different senses, so take things she CAN handle like strong sweets, essential oil on a handkerchief, textured things to touch etc, and if a noise starts up, immediately get her engaged with those things and tell her it will make the noise go away.\n\nIt was suggested by our therapist and it was how we got our son over his intense terror of haircuts and having his hair brushed. Doesn't always work and sometimes there isn't time to head off a meltdown but it's surprising how often it does alleviate the distress, especially if she has sufficient understanding for you to explain in advance that you'll be doing these things next time there's a nasty noise as it will help her to feel better.", "While you can ask, and there\u2019s nothing wrong in asking.

Once you stop looking for quick fixes you can start to look at more productive real life solutions for situations like these. \nTalk to other parents with ASD children. There\u2019s support groups as well as forums. \n\nMe, I used noise cancelling headphones before going to the bathroom.

I don't think this is about whether or not you're an asshole. It's just an unrealistic expectation that no one will ever use a hand dryer while she's in the bathroom and so it's necessary to find other solutions to the problem. I do think that lady was being an asshole for being so rude about it and for making that comment to you, because this isn't about your daughter being old enough to learn to deal. It's about her needing to find accommodations that do not require expecting strangers to agree to take part in the accommodation. I don't think you're an asshole for just asking, and it doesn't seem like you gave her shit for it when she said no. But this question is about generally asking people not to use them, and I do think you're in the wrong for expecting that to be the solution to this problem, and expecting others to give you that control over their choices, especially since you don't know that someone doesn't have a legitimate reason to use a blow dryer instead of a paper towel.
