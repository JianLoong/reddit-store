But there is nothing wrong with wanting to sell the stuff instead of giving it away. In the end of the day you guys worked hard and bought those items for your house. It is okay to want to get money from your investment. I think he needs to step off his moral high horse and realize that it is okay to make some extra money to save and also try to understand your emotions at this time. He should be extra understanding and try to make you feel secure as you are bringing this new baby into your lives.", "INFO Were you asking him to do the selling himself? Or were you going to do that and asked if he was okay with selling the stuff in general?", "INFO:\n\n1. Are the items joint or sole property? If they are sole property, do they belong to you or your husband?\n\n2. If they belong to you, why did you ask your husband to sell them? Why didn't you simply go ahead and do it yourself?\n\n3. What is your primary motivator to getting rid of the items? Are you trying to free up necessary space, are you wanting to raise money, or are you wanting to get rid simply because they've not been used in a while?\n\n4. If you sold them, would you be trying to sell them for profit or would you be selling them at a loss but enough to make something? \n\n5. Does your husband understand your position on the answers to 3 & 4?\n\n6. If you went down your husband's line and gave them away, would he offer them free-to-a-good-home or would take them to a charity shop or donate them to a group who he knows for certain will give them free to someone in need?\n\n7. What type of items are these? Are they necessities like clothing, bedding, crockery, tent - things that people may actually need? Or are they decorative items, added extras?\n\n*My first question is relevant to who gets to decide to bin, donate or sell the items.* \n\n*My other questions as much for you to consider. Because it is unclear whether you might have been having a conversation at cross purposes. And if you were to give them away free, there is still the chance the taker will then try to sell it on for a profit. (Nothing is guaranteed.)*  \n\n*My seventh question relates to whether a 'saviour complex' is even appropriate in context of what you are referring to.*   \n\n*But setting aside your and your husband's views on getting rid of anything, his reaction to your suggestion and the way it made you feel leads my to another question:*\n\n8. Did he when he said it, does he now, understand that you've grown up with financial limitations which haven't allowed you to give away useable items to others for free? Does he understand he was insulting not just you, but the way you grew up, your family?", "NTA, nothing wrong with wanting to make a little more money before giving birth", "NTA ... and a bit concerning because you just want to have some money you could use for the baby yourself \n\nSome ppl use finances to control their spouses", "NTA. Does he not realise how expensive babies are?", "NTA - I guess if it\u2019s worth something and you can get money for it sell it. You can also get tax breaks for charity if you itemize, but it has to be a fair degree of stuff.", "NAH, although your husband does come across as a bit unhinged over this topic so that could be a \ud83d\udea9.\n\nThat said, we had lots of accumulated stuff - good stuff too - and had our one and only garage sale with marked, extremely reasonable prices. People still came up to us and said \u2018I\u2019ll give you $5 for this guitar priced at $70.\u2019 It was ridiculous and just made us feel ick. In the end, donating most of it to charity and local libraries was a substantially larger tax deduction as well as helping people that actually need it rather than people just looking to get stuff for pennies on the $.\n\nThis may be the case for you guys too. It\u2019s often just not worth the hassle unless you really do need the money. And many charities do wonderful work with those less fortunate.\n\nThat said, if there are specific, high value items, it might be worth selling those individually. How much $$ do you think you\u2019d make?", "NTA in this economy you should liquidate anything you can spare and anything that won't sell try and give to a charity.", "NAH.", "Very mild YTA in my opinion.. there is a difference between living a comfortable life and providing a child with \u2018the best of everything\u2019 and that comes down to priorities. In a comfortable life there is room to donate to charity rather than sell and make a difference for someone, but that\u2019s not the case if you want the best of everything. Being raised in a home where we donated often I may be biased here, but I would say I gained a lot of happiness from it, and learned valuable lessons from it. This sounds like a decision for both you and your husband to talk about based on what you value", "NTA. I don't see what difference it makes to him. The stuff is going either way. I don't know why he's getting upset over you selling the items.", "YTA\n\nHis \"savior complex\" - damn you're hateful and an A. Your husband proposed that you do something for someone other than yourself and you balked at the idea, threw in the tragic \"grew up too poor to care for anyone's needs but my own\" tale to excuse your selfishness, and concluded that he has a mental disorder. SMH", "You've told us how your husband made you feel but not what he said. It's tough to get a handle on the exchange here. Scare quotes on *teach*. What exactly was said? You put the question and he went from zero to angry/pious?\n\n>charity literally begins at home\n\nYou covered that you're comfortable. So where's the explicit need for charity? You're feeling generalised money-fear (what if there isn't enough in the future) that even wealthy people feel in such an unstable, money-based society as ours. I would try to get over this. Nesting is for birds who don't typically have a house the rest of the year. Most babies are born into deep poverty, any stories you have to do with extra feathers for the nest are likely just narrative and not actual necessity.\n\nNeither of you is a massive asshole here, you just have different positions. Can you compromise?\n\nThere's an argument that the Western family model, and marriage in general, causes couples to turn away from community and towards an insular, self-focused state that contributes to wider societal breakdown. Your husband's instincts are fair and outward-facing. I'm not saying you're a grasping asshole but double-check with yourself that you need a money exchange for every object that leaves your hands. It could be auspicious to be more generous as the baby approaches.\n\nLooking after babies and caring for tribe is something many or most animals of all complexity manage. This creates an idea of dangerous Others. I wonder if humans can't lift themselves up further than that.", "NTA Make a pile of his hobby stuff and volunteer to sell it to help others. Feed his own rhetoric back to him. If he wants to ego-stimulate himself about how much of a savior he is he should do it by making an actual personal sacrifice, not stealing away money that would otherwise go to the baby.", "Nta his reaction is alarming", "Nothing worse than a stay at home mom that is money hungry", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He is either just an AH, or there's some underlying issue he's not dealing with properly and lashed out. That's his issue though and he should apologize and you need to set that boundary that yelling over something as small as selling items(with the exception of sentimental items) is completely unacceptable.

We don't know, and have no way of knowing whether the husband is on an ego trip. He hasn't said anything wrong -- they seem comfortable, there's no threat to baby. The actual exchange of words isn't quoted. Where is your vitriol coming from?\n\nJesus advocated selling all your shit to follow him. It's not a terrible idea, probably good for the soul. But extreme. Buddha was more pragmatic and acknowledged that householders may not manage to go the whole way (in this life). We can go easy on one another.
