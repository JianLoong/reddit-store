It's no wonder you've never gotten along with that cousin! \n\nThen let me get this straight, it was rude of you to speak a a language that your family didn't understand but it wasn't rude of your family to speak a language that your boyfriend didn't understand? Nah, it doesn't work that way! And I wouldn't be apologizing to anyone when you did nothing wrong, that's a very bad precedent to set!", "NTA. Haven\u2019t a clue what they think you did wrong. Also your cousin seems a bit strange in thinking your BF shouldn\u2019t speak Japanese because he\u2019s Chinese\u2026", "NTA.  You are communicating with your BF in the only language common to your both at the moment.  In time I trust he will learn English and you will learn Chinese.  As for your cousin, people can converse in a language not their own - the only confused person is her because of her preconceived ideas.", "NTA maybe your dad shouldn't have bothered trying to patch things up with them they sound like AHs", "NTA - anyone who says to apologise \u2018to keep the peace\u2019 is a moron and an AH.  \nThey know you aren\u2019t in the wrong but want you to apologise anyway.", "NTA, they all are. Maybe they should learn Chinese and be more hospitable, but in any case they owe you both an apology.", "NTA. Tell them to learn another language.", "NTA\nThey were guests and acted like AH. It\u2019s not the same when everyone can speak the same language and speak in different one. Then you can assume they have secret conversation. And your dad\u2019s a bit AH, for wanting you to apologize.", "NTA, the cousin was acting very strangely. There\u2019s nothing abnormal about what you did, but the aunt and uncle saying if he wants to be part of the family he needs to learn English are going too far and need to mind their business. He\u2019s not marrying them! It\u2019s borderline racist for them to act that way.", "NTA - Your Aunt, Uncle and Cousin sound rude. Were they expecting him to sit there and listen to them make noises and he have zero to little context!?!?!. Sounds pretty ignorant to me. \n\nYour boyfriend will assimilate over time, not immediately. That said, you're both allowed to speak what ever language you want. Especially in your own home!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I don't speak Chinese and while he understands some English he isn't fluent. However, we are both fluent in Japanese and often talk in Japanese because it is easier for us.\nThis past weekend he came over to my house and met my family for the first time.

Huge respect to you and your boyfriend for being bilingual, making it work for you, and he\u2019s learning a third language as well? And! You were translating for them, and they got mad? Do they not realize how mentally taxing that can be? They need a reality check. Next time just speak Japanese and make them use google translate to converse with you both", "NTA dont keep the peace, keeping the peace allows people who are rude and obnoxious and racist to get away with it.\n\nIf they want to be part of his family they can learn Chinese - it works both ways.  America is a country of immigrants, English isn't even the official language on a federal level, the native languages are spoken by the indigenous tribes.  You are translating and he is trying to learn and he knows more languages then they do. Its so rude how they treated him - its just awful. Who does that to a guest in their home", "I don't think they understand how little English he speaks. They know he can understand some as he did introduce himself to them, but besides basic conversation, he has trouble speaking and listening. He can read and write really well but has trouble pronouncing things and catching words when they're said to him.", "I guess they were upset that I was saying things that they couldn't understand in front of them and they thought it was rude because I could be saying things about them. She's obsessed with anime and Japanese culture I think she was just upset that he wasn't actually Japanese", "I am trying to learn Chinese, but it's going very slowly. I'm not as good as picking up languages as he is, but he's a great teacher. I really don't understand why she  got so upset about it especially considering the first conversion was private. She is obsessed with anime and Japan so she might have been upset that he's not Japanese", "Yeah I was just thinking all both just upset about being wrong. Your family being wrong about you using a foreign language to talk about them, and your cousin being wrong for assuming he\u2019s Japanese.", "The fact you are trying to learn Chinese (a very difficult language to be sure) speaks volumes about your commitment.  Well done and good luck.", "NTA the irony that they're all talking a language he can't understand yet and then are pissed you're translating.", "NTA, and hopefully your cousin has learned an important lesson about the ability of non-English speakers to be fluent in multiple languages. Also, we don't apologize to xenophobic bigots.", "Your family is just racist. Point blank period. \n\nNTA i would have called them out for it then and there", "Yta. He needs to learn English befire he goes to an English speaking country.", "NTA\n\nYou were trying to keep your boyfriend in the loop as to what was going on with the conversation. Do they really think so little of you that they believe you would have a private conversation in front of them? Neither you, nor your BF, did anything to apologize for.", "NTA. They are idiots if they can't understand the difference between translating for him and having a separate conversation with him.", "Nta", "NTA. Yinz talk to each other in a language you both speak, which makes perfect sense. Tell your jerky family members to learn Japanese if they want to eavesdrop.", "NTA. But your family !", "NTA\u2026cousin isn't either but she is an idiot for saying him talking Japanese will confuse people. You and your friends can converse in any darned language you feel like\u2026especially if the particular one is just between you two. OTOH, in a mixed group then talking in both the language everyone understands and the one you're best in is certainly just fine as well\u2026you need to read the room in that situation so no one feels awkward or ostracized.", "NTA!", "NTA.  Aunt, cousin, uncle, AHs.", "God no NTA. It seems pretty rude to prevent a person from translating when a person is not fluent in English. Cousin is def TA. Dad is also TA because he is enabling the bad behavior.", "This x 1000.  They sound like IGNORANT AHs.  Maybe they should travel some time and get over themselves.  Sounds very \u2018Murica!", "You realize America doesn\u2019t have an official language?", "Your post is a hot mess of racism from all these people. You and your boyfriend are fine. The rest of them...\\*shudder\\*.", "I think she needs to learn that people aren't accessories... NTA btw.", "You're both very impressive!", "And he's trying to learn English, which is also difficult! Both of you are honestly kind of amazing.", "NTA. Your aunt, uncle and cousin are.\n\nIt is unrealistic of people to expect newcomers to be able to speak English overnight. It takes a lot of time and hard work to speak fluently. You would have been rude to not translate for your boyfriend, making him feel left out. \n\n*When I explained that he was Chinese she got really annoyed and said that we shouldn't be talking in Japanese then because it will just confuse people.*\n\nWhat does it matter if it confuses people if they know neither language and the words are not being directed at them?\n\nYou do not owe anyone an apology. They owe you and apology, but I wouldn't hold your breath. I can understand why your father has had nothing to do with these people for years.", "NTA\n\n> My aunt and uncle agreed with her and said that if my boyfriend wants to be a part of the family he needs to learn English.\n\nThis is how racists behave.", "why are you spelling apologise with a Z, am i stupid?", "NTA. But I would be concerned that your dad is prepared to just go along with blatant racism from his brother and family than to defend his daughter just because he\u2019s trying to heal a falling out from what I can gather was probably the brothers fault. Based off the fact your dad appears to be trying to bend over backwards for him.", "It's so galling how many people say that you are right but apologise to keep the peace. That's why assholes exist. \n\nYour boyfriend did not cause a fight. Assholes did and neither of them was you. \n\nNTA", "NTA- your relatives sound like racist AH\u2019s.", "NTA. You were including your bf in the conversation. Making him, as the outsider, feel welcome. \nCousin might have been disappointed he wasn't Japanese, but that's on her. And weird.\n100% do not apologize to keep the peace. That shit is overrated. You weren't in the wrong. Those family members too insecure to believe you weren't talking shit about them need to get over themselves and  apologize to you and your bf. IMO.", "NTA\n\nIf your dad wants to keep the peace, he can stop inviting racist assholes to dinner and/or make them apologize to your boyfriend.", "NTA", "NTA, your cousin & her parents are racist AHs. I wouldn\u2019t apologize, they were incredibly rude and if anyone needs to apologize it\u2019s them. I honestly think your dad owes you one as well for even suggesting that you apologize.", "\u201cBorderline\u201d nothin, they sound racist af. The cousin said him speaking Japanese might \u201cconfuse people\u201d (presumably about his ethnicity) like that\u2019s his problem, immediately assumed you were gossiping about her when you were translating, then saying he needs to learn English to be a part of the family\u2014fuck them! OP, you understand eachother & that\u2019s enough. You\u2019re NTA. Please do not apologize to these twats.", "He's already bilingual and they haven't mastered basic manners... Don't apologize, you did nothing wrong"]}
