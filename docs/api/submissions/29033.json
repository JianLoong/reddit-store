He was able to answer some but because he's not fluent in English and has only spent a year in Japan (we met while we were both studying there) he couldn't answer all of them.

It's no wonder you've never gotten along with that cousin! \n\nThen let me get this straight, it was rude of you to speak a a language that your family didn't understand but it wasn't rude of your family to speak a language that your boyfriend didn't understand? Nah, it doesn't work that way! And I wouldn't be apologizing to anyone when you did nothing wrong, that's a very bad precedent to set!", "NTA. Haven\u2019t a clue what they think you did wrong. Also your cousin seems a bit strange in thinking your BF shouldn\u2019t speak Japanese because he\u2019s Chinese\u2026", "NTA.  You are communicating with your BF in the only language common to your both at the moment.  In time I trust he will learn English and you will learn Chinese.  As for your cousin, people can converse in a language not their own - the only confused person is her because of her preconceived ideas.", "NTA maybe your dad shouldn't have bothered trying to patch things up with them they sound like AHs", "NTA - anyone who says to apologise \u2018to keep the peace\u2019 is a moron and an AH.  \nThey know you aren\u2019t in the wrong but want you to apologise anyway.", "NTA, they all are. Maybe they should learn Chinese and be more hospitable, but in any case they owe you both an apology.", "NTA. Tell them to learn another language.", "NTA\nThey were guests and acted like AH. It\u2019s not the same when everyone can speak the same language and speak in different one. Then you can assume they have secret conversation. And your dad\u2019s a bit AH, for wanting you to apologize.", "NTA, the cousin was acting very strangely. There\u2019s nothing abnormal about what you did, but the aunt and uncle saying if he wants to be part of the family he needs to learn English are going too far and need to mind their business. He\u2019s not marrying them! It\u2019s borderline racist for them to act that way.", "NTA - Your Aunt, Uncle and Cousin sound rude. Were they expecting him to sit there and listen to them make noises and he have zero to little context!?!?!. Sounds pretty ignorant to me. \n\nYour boyfriend will assimilate over time, not immediately. That said, you're both allowed to speak what ever language you want. Especially in your own home!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Huge respect to you and your boyfriend for being bilingual, making it work for you, and he\u2019s learning a third language as well? And! You were translating for them, and they got mad? Do they not realize how mentally taxing that can be? They need a reality check. Next time just speak Japanese and make them use google translate to converse with you both", "NTA dont keep the peace, keeping the peace allows people who are rude and obnoxious and racist to get away with it.\n\nIf they want to be part of his family they can learn Chinese - it works both ways.  America is a country of immigrants, English isn't even the official language on a federal level, the native languages are spoken by the indigenous tribes.  You are translating and he is trying to learn and he knows more languages then they do. Its so rude how they treated him - its just awful. Who does that to a guest in their home", "I don't think they understand how little English he speaks. They know he can understand some as he did introduce himself to them, but besides basic conversation, he has trouble speaking and listening. He can read and write really well but has trouble pronouncing things and catching words when they're said to him.", "I guess they were upset that I was saying things that they couldn't understand in front of them and they thought it was rude because I could be saying things about them. She's obsessed with anime and Japanese culture I think she was just upset that he wasn't actually Japanese", "I am trying to learn Chinese, but it's going very slowly. I'm not as good as picking up languages as he is, but he's a great teacher. I really don't understand why she  got so upset about it especially considering the first conversion was private. She is obsessed with anime and Japan so she might have been upset that he's not Japanese", "Yeah I was just thinking all both just upset about being wrong. Your family being wrong about you using a foreign language to talk about them, and your cousin being wrong for assuming he\u2019s Japanese.", "The fact you are trying to learn Chinese (a very difficult language to be sure) speaks volumes about your commitment.  Well done and good luck."]}
