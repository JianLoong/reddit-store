If you really wanted to make it right, you should have negotiated the terms, set a date when the camera would be removed, adjustments to the curfew, etc. You cannot expect people to trust you right off the bat after committing such a horrific, sociopathic act. Yes you did your time, but you need to show you can live among people without committing more, similar or worse crimes again.

Hell uno reverse  'I don't feel comfortable living with your affair partner.", "NTA. You live in unfair system,  dad ran when  your mum got ill and you tried to save your mum, yes  what you did was illegal, but you tried to save the only person  you had left.  \n\n\nYou  father should be ashamed of him self, he left his child to fend for  her self and you were young and  you did was most children would do, try to save mummy.  \n\n\nAs mum,  I just want to pick  you up and hug and tell everything will be all right, but I know it wont be.  But here is a mum hug.", "What your dad did is way worse than stealing to pay for cancer treatment for your mum in my opinion.", "NTA my heart hurts for you", "NTA. Your dad is a piece of work. Stay with your aunt. Your a legal adult now. You can also block their numbers on your phone.", "There has to be way more to all of this. \nAre you on probation?

Ooooo you are better than me. Cause the verbal attack your dad would get from me is a lot. Big talk how they don\u2019t want you near the baby and want all these things when he can\u2019t even bear to hold down the family, when his wife was sick. Please, move to NC and wish their newborn well.", "NTA - stay with your aunt.   Your dad\u2019s wife will never be comfortable with you, therefore the rules will always exist and probably more will be added.", "NTA but Dad and the mistress are!  Glad you have your Aunt.", "Literally, like *you* are gonna judge your kid for going to juvie as if you didn't abandon your dying wife and child *who stole money to try and save your wife*. It's not like OP was a violent criminal who did truely horrific shit. The dad is a pathetic coward", "Let\u2019s just get down to the real issue. They don\u2019t want OP there. OP has been legally judged an AH by stealing money from a dying woman. Sure, she was young and dumb, but that\u2019s probably still true despite that she is legally an adult. In fact, she\u2019s spent the last X years in juvie NOT having any of the opportunities a high school student has to grow and mature. OP is starting from a deficit to move in at all. \n\nIt\u2019s not WILD to think that you wouldn\u2019t want a kid convicted of stealing from their dying mother in your house. Add on to the fact, that new wife KNOWS her husband can\u2019t be counted on in sickness and health, now she has to worry about his daughter falling back in to old habits. OP was NEVER going to be welcome. \n\nMaybe dad feels bad about that, because he knows he fucked OP over, but not enough to lose his new wife and potentially-non-thieving child. So he agreed to all wife\u2019s demands, but he doesn\u2019t *really* want OP there. It sucks, and thank god for aunt, but it was never NOT going to be a bad idea to move in with dad, who didn\u2019t want OP when she wasn\u2019t a convicted felon. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, OP, but you were never going to be happy and welcome living there. Don\u2019t waste your time fretting about it. Your time there wouldn\u2019t have been pleasant, even if you hadn\u2019t stolen from you mom. He isn\u2019t a great dad; likely never was. \n\nFocus on growing and thriving and catching up to your peers. Make your aunt proud that she took a chance on you, and prove your dad and his wife wrong. You won\u2019t need to have arguments about whether he\u2019s wrong and you\u2019re worthy of love and support. The proof will be in getting your life together and thriving.", "Yeah, I could maybe understand them putting cameras in rooms with their valuables in them, since OP did go to juvenile for stealing. I wouldn't agree with them doing that, since she stole for a specific and very understandable reason, but at least it would be logical. But in her room?! And telling her if she wants to change clothes to go into the bathroom?! Hell no.", "No, One of my friends was asked to housesit someone's house they were fairly wealthy so she thought If we stole a few pieces of their jewelry and some money from their safe that they wouldn't noticed.\n\nNoone was even home the only reason I got over a year was because one of the pieces of jewelry was an antique that was worth alot of money.", "I think it was a typo. They wanted to put a camera in OPs room and so presumably instructed her to \"change\" in the bathroom because she'd have a creepy ass camera in the bedroom and couldn't therefore change clothes in there", "Um, no. She didn\u2019t steal from her mother,  she stole to try to pay for mom\u2019s treatment. And your assumption is unwarranted. There\u2019s a wide disparity in sentencing. Judges have a lot of power to lengthen sentences. This could possibly have been appealed, but it might have required a parent to appeal for her, which, as we read, would probably be unlikely. A camera in her private space is unethical at best no matter how temporary, and threatens her rehabilitation. She didn\u2019t commit a \u201chorrendous, sociopathic act.\u201d There\u2019s no justification for these rules. A history of theft isn\u2019t indicative of a risk of violence, and a camera is unnecessary and unreasonable. If you\u2019re going to make judgments in this forum, it\u2019s important to read carefully.", "I think you should read the post again. OP stole to pay for cancer medication her mum needed. Cancer treatments are expensive AF, especially in America (which I\u2019m assuming OP is) so, yeah, it\u2019s gonna have been a large amount.

She stole to help her mom pay for treatment", "She stole For her mom, not from her.", "OP stole to help pay for her sick mother\u2019s experimental treatment.
