A camera in your room is way out of line. Does he want to watch you change clothes, masturbate or change a tampon? You are allowed to have privacy. \n\nYou stole some money. I'd understand if they had installed a safe for their valuables or something.", "YTA. If you want to live someplace, you have to follow the rules. You stole from your own mother WHO WAS DYING FORM CANCER! And if it wAs enough to warrant you being locked up for a year and a half, it was either a huge amount, the last of a series of crimnal acts, or you did something else too. If you really wanted to make it right, you should have negotiated the terms, set a date when the camera would be removed, adjustments to the curfew, etc. You cannot expect people to trust you right off the bat after committing such a horrific, sociopathic act. Yes you did your time, but you need to show you can live among people without committing more, similar or worse crimes again. With a new baby coming, Dad and Stepmom are right to be apprehensive and justified in making you follow these rules.
