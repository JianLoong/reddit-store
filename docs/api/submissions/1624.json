She\u2019s responsible enough to have her own license and her own car\u2026she should be responsible enough to to follow the basic rules of the road no matter where she is. You don\u2019t get a free pass just because you\u2019re driving somewhere you don\u2019t usually drive. Speed limit signs exist for a reason. And it\u2019s not even like it was on the way there and you were in the passenger seat urging her to hurry up and drive faster.

I don't get where she gets the idea you are responsible.", "NTA\n\nDrivers are taught to look out for speed limits and stick to them, and the fact she didn't isn't your problem. Her argument that she wouldn't have received the fine had she not driven you to the airport is ridiculous; her breaking the speed limit is what caused the fine, nothing more.\n\nThe only person causing drama here is her, so don't feel pressured into paying.", "NTA but she\u2019s your friend and housemate and was doing you a favor. Offer to pay half. It isn\u2019t worth $60 to have a hostile living situation. Depending on where you live, it could\u2019ve been $60+ to get an Uber to the airport (I\u2019ve seen $80+ for less than 5 miles in major cities, not even on a holiday but just busy travel days). \n\nI got a parking ticket while on a trip with some friends and they all pitched in without my asking, even though I was fully prepared to pay it, as they knew I was doing the driving for all of them. If you can afford the $60 tell her you\u2019re not willing to pay it in full, since she needs to be aware of her surroundings and not just ignore speed limits/\u2018enforced by radar\u2019 signs, but that you also recognize she was in an unfamiliar area because she was doing you a favor and you don\u2019t want her to be completely out for that favor.

She was driving, and she doesn't have to be familiar with a road to be able to read a speed limit sign. That's called paying attention and being literate. If one is driving on an unfamiliar road, you'd think they would be even more alert and looking for the speed limit signs.", "NTA you didn\u2019t cause her to speed.  I\u2019m sure there are signs that have the speed limit posted??", "NTA. Every driver is responsible for paying attention to the posted speed limits, whether they\u2019re familiar with the roads or not. \n\nAlso, she was speeding on the way home, so she can\u2019t even use the excuse that she was speeding to get you there on time. She needs to accept responsibility for her choices/actions.", "NTA - if you fold now you're letting her know that it's fine to not take responsibility. She's an adult she pays for her own mistakes.", "NTA, but if it was legitimately 6km over and most other roads in your area don\u2019t ticket for that little over, paying would be a decent thing. You\u2019re not required to by any means.  Her demanding it makes her a AH here. \n\nAround here, pretty much everyone knows you can drive 5mph over the speed limit unless it\u2019s in a school zone without getting a ticket, everyone does it.  (Fwiw, 5 mph is faster than 6 kmh)\n\nI\u2019d assume she wasn\u2019t just going 6km over, but my experience might not apply here.", "NTA. Did you put your foot on her foot forcing her to go over the speed limit? Did you do anything at all to make her go over the speed limit? Would that even be possible?", "NTA\n\nWhat a load of bollocks from her.  She's the driver, she's responsible for her driving. If she can't drive safely in an unfamiliar area she shouldn't be driving. The fine is absolutely nothing to do with you.", "NTA. That's bullshit.", "Nta.. you said it would of be AFTER  they had dropped you off.   \n\nMaybe if it was trying to get you to the airport,  but afterwards... no I would not pay.", "NTA she needs to suck it up and pay the fine. She was the one speeding not you, you didn't make her speed, and if she was uncomfortable driving on unfamiliar roads she could have turned you down for the ride", "Nta. That's actually ridiculous. Don't pay it. She needs to take responsibility for her actions. The fact that she was unfamiliar with the road means she should've been driving slower, not speeding.", "Sooooo I'm gonna go against the grain here and say that you're kind of TA.\n\nYour friend did you a favor. She wouldn't have been driving there if it weren't for her kindness. The money might not seem like much to you, but what about her?? Maybe that's a huge amount for her to have to part with right now. \n\nSometimes being technically correct *is not* kind.

Split the fine.", "ESH a little. \n\nIt was on the way home. It\u2019s not like you had been dawdling and made her rush on the way there. If she is incapable of operating her motor vehicle in the prescribed manner, she should probably not accept such tasks.\n\nThat being said, you could pay it for her to make peace. Think of it as acknowledgment of the stress & annoyance of having to drop someone off at the airport. She used her vehicle, her gas, and her time to do a favour for you.

Did you pay her at all for her gas, or something? How far out of the way is the airport? I honestly believe that you should pay her something for driving you out there.

(Unmanned, they just photograph you and send you a ticket.)\n\nCompared to the US, our speed limits are strictly enforced to the posted limit.  But there\u2019s like a 2km/hr leeway and your car\u2019s speedometer should be set to slightly inflate your speed.  \n\nSo being charged for going 66k/hr means they were probably doing 70k/hr according to their own speedo.\n\nWhich actually fits with the friend\u2019s story of not knowing the area.   Most speed limits are in 10k increments, so if she missed a sign she might\u2019ve guessed the wrong limit for that specific road.\n\nOP is NTA though.  It\u2019s the driver\u2019s responsibility to notice the speed signs.", "If it\u2019s Australia (and the fine matches), it\u2019s the owner\u2019s responsibility to ID the driver.
