Her main request to the bridesmaids was having hair and makeup done by the same HMUA (Rika paying) the morning of the wedding for the getting-ready hangout. Rika had her mind set on a specific HMUA that offered a fancy bridal experience with lots of extras and she was very excited about it.\n\nI wear bold, dramatic makeup daily. I had no issue sticking to Rika\u2019s very different preferred style for her wedding. However, over the last few years I had a number of painful reactions to make up products and I was never able to figure out the trigger. If I immediately take makeup off pain goes away in hours and discomfort fades in a few days. While reactions are rare, I now stick to specific make up lines I know work for me.\n\nI asked Rika if she could ask the HMUA what products they use; or I could do my own makeup while everyone else was getting theirs done (trying for the same look). But Rika just kept saying she had a reputable MUA that followed professional standards of hygiene, and that the makeup would be quite light. It seemed in her head, reactions could only happen with a shady MUA or heavy makeup.\n\nRika said she could pay for me to have a trial done on the same day she\u2019d have hers so I don't have to worry. I agreed like a dumbass, then realised that didn\u2019t work, because if the MUA used a triggering product, I would still have a painful reaction just on a different day. I messaged Rika again, and had the same pointless conversations.\n\nThe trial day was coming. I didn't want to just cancel\u2026 it made sense in my head to message the MUA with my question directly.\n\nUnexpectedly, the MUA straight up said she can't work on me for liability reasons as I cannot identify problem ingredients. Not even using products I name as safe. She also asked if the bride was aware. Turns out Rika had filled out a form that confirmed no one had known makeup sensitivities. I don't blame Rika, she signs medical and customs forms without reading them. But the MUA was enraged: she almost fired Rika as a client, 5 weeks ahead of the wedding (they worked it out; fwiw I haven\u2019t ever heard of a MUA with such forms or such a hardcore stance in general).\n\nRika and her maid of honour since implied I was intentionally sabotaging so I could do my usual \"attention grabbing\" makeup.

The more people say this, the more I'm thinking maybe that IS what is expected of a friend.\n\nObviously my worst move was messaging the MUA directly. But I wasn't getting anywhere with Rika and I was afraid that she'd be mad if I just said I wasn't doing the HMUA thing. But the more I think of it, going behind her back on something so important to her may make me the AH.\n\nETA: people keep asking about patch tasting: my reactions only trigger on my lips and eyelids, arm swatching or w/e doesn't help.", "created_utc": 1694969882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16l5wdw/aita_for_reaching_out_to_the_brides_mua_behind/", "score": 207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Usually, the reaction is mild, like stinging and red, sometimes it has caused blistering and swelling and twice have ended up needing to go to A&E(ER). Makeup/skin care products are the main contenders, and so I am also very careful what I use. Even if its mild, I don't want a breakout or dry skin.

There is a difference between \"you know product xyz kinda made my eyes itch can we use this instead?\"  and \"I have a severe allergy to some products but I cannot tell you which ones or why so I don't know if what you'll use will cause me to have a reaction\" in a phone call or message.  \n\nNo MUA wants you to feel uncomfortable on the big day.  If you brought a similar palate from a brand that is safe for you I doubt it would have bothered her.", "You have a great user name. Sorry for irrelevant comment.", "Reputable make up artists will *always* make a big deal about skin sensitivities, hygiene and cross-contamination - regardless of whether they've had a client in the past with a bad reaction - because they're dealing with people's skin and allergies can range from a bit of itching to full-blown medical emergencies that require hospitalisation. It's very serious and they shouldn't be complacent about it.", "I would think with your history of having allergic reactions, having a mindful and careful MUA would be a good thing? She\u2019s definitely not at fault for being careful, if she used something that broke you out it could open her up to litigation and/or having a complaint against her cosmetologist license. It\u2019s her livelihood. I would not be surprised if the MUA makes the decision for you and declines to do your makeup for the wedding day. I\u2019d be prepared and discuss this with the bride. \nSpeaking to a wedding vendor without the couples knowledge can be risky. It would\u2019ve been better if you had gone to your friend in person, sat her down and said, \u201cif I don\u2019t have info on what makeup brands will be used, I\u2019ll have to do my own makeup\u201d, and let the chips fall. You are absolutely in the right to protect your skin and face! \nThe comment about \u201cattention grabbing makeup\u201d rubs me the wrong way. Bridal parties often have an aesthetic, but brides do not own people. If it bothered her that much she should\u2019ve not asked you to be a part of the bridal party. \nMy vote is (soft on you) ESH.", "Your insecurity is telling you that you're wrong, your common sense is telling you that you're right. You already know which one you should listen to.\n\nAnd FYI, anybody telling you \"just risk an allergic reaction lmao\" is not your friend.", "NTA. The bride did not take your health concerns seriously and wouldn\u2019t even let you find alternative options, despite the risk at sever discomfort (forgive me if that downplays it, but it really doesn\u2019t matter for my opinion), then she turns out to have signed a contract on behalf of her bridesmaids with no (or no serious) attempt at even asking them, basically showing zero care for their wellbeing or at the very least a dangerous lack of awareness, and when she is confronted with her ignorance or entitlement, blames it on you?\n\nShe is no friend, but a leech. Is she always this big of an entitled a-hole? You can get better friends than her. Sound like it\u2019s high time to consider that option.", "I'm conflicted too 2bh \n\nI'm an allergy gal so i totally get feeling like a massive pain when trying to advocate for my own  health to both stubborn and 'overcautious' people (for example, some of my allergies are only when ingested but I've had to fight not to get kicked out of a room because someone else was eating something that contained it, and it's not peanuts) \n\nBut also having such a vague understanding of the issue does put everyone in a tricky situation as compromise or reasonable accommodation is a lot more difficult. Perhaps your friend should have just let you do your own, but since your style is so different to what she wants, i can see why she wouldn't be super confident with that option. And the mua has a client who doesn't know what will set her off, so basically has to assume everything will and therefore buy whole new products and tools to ensure there's no cross contamination. \n\nMaybe showing your friend you can do her preferred style yourself will settle things down? \n\nAnd i realise that this won't often interfere with life and other people the way food allergies do, but it would probably still be worth really nailing down what is doing this to you. Formulations change, you don't want to suddenly lose something that was 'safe' and have no idea how to screen for new safe things without just slapping them on and seeing if you react!", "And if the MUA is using the potentially triggering products on other clients in the same session it would take a lot of extra work to make sure there is no cross contamination. I can understand someone not wanting to have that responsibility if they're not sure they can guarantee to avoid the reaction.", "oh yeah i didn't think she was worried about cross contamination. I just used it as an example of intensity of the MUA's reaction. I tried to explain I can tolerate most products just fine, she was absolutely not having any of that unless I had verified information about the triggers and \"type\" of reaction I had. \n\nAs I mentioned I just looked up her website and she's super hardcore on hygiene and appropriately dealing with sensitivities and allergies according to her FAQ so maybe she had a bad allergic reaction on a client in the past? Or maybe that is normal for MUA on her level, I've never dealt with anyone that fancy", "People with sensitivities bring their own stuff.  I have allergies, bring my own, and do fine.  I usually ask what they want me to bring as far as tools and stuff and I\u2019m pretty fond of makeup so I have it most of the time (I have to buy sponges sometimes, which I never use, but makeup artists around here seem to like).", "No. I was going to ask if she has certain makeup lines and ranges in her kit and if she could achieve the requested look with those products (there are a lot of safe options from well known brands). If she said no, I'd be able to go back to Rika in advance of the trial and wedding and say look the only option is for me to do my own makeup. Although someone else also pointed out I could offer to bring my makeup for the MUA. \n\nBut none of that happened because once I mentioned the issue she took over the conversation, asked me a bunch of questions and snapped into a wrathful mode (at Rika, not me)", "So, I had a reaction to a number of different products over the years. I compared the ingredient lists and couldn't identify anything that was common to those products and wasn't present in other make up I used for years without issue.\r  \n\r  \nI then went to a dermatologist who told me it didn't even have to be an allergic reaction to specific ingredient but could be something about formulation making my most sensitive skin (lips and eyelids) react. She asked if I was willing to give up makeup altogether and then gave me advice on managing my symptoms should a reaction occur.\r  \n\r  \nIf you have any other advice on what could be done I would welcome it.", "Makes sense. Previous times I dealt with MUAs I was a broke student and the MUA themselves tended to be inexperienced young talents, so they probably haven't set all of that up yet.", "oh yeah to be honest i'm definitely the asshole in my judgement of MUA's carefulness at least. Her looking out for me is entirely a good thing, and the only reason I wish she was less careful is so that none of this had to happen.", "thanks for your perspective from an allergy gal!\n\nunfortunately idk what to do to determine this, comparing ingredients didn't identify an obvious culprit and the dermatologist was like \"looks like contact dermatitis! avoid all eye or lip makeup or use this cream to manage reactions, good luck.\"", "Oh! I see what i mean. Yeah if she dabbed some Too Faced LL on another bridesmaid with her finger and then touched my lips without totally cleaning that lipstick off, we could have A Problem", "She has probably been sued before and now won\u2019t risk it which is fair enough.", "Yeah that didn't occur to me in makeup context. When i dealt with MUAs, even young ones, they had whole carts of their pro-looking kits and in my mind, they just use those. My bad, do you think that makes me the AH?", ">I was going to ask if she has certain makeup lines and ranges in her kit and if she could achieve the requested look with those products (there are a lot of safe options from well known brands). If she said no, I'd be able to go back to Rika in advance of the trial and wedding and say look the only option is for me to do my own makeup.\n\nWait. So, it sounds like you actually WERE just using this for leverage to tell Rika you had to do your own makeup, then??\n\nIf that's the case, YTA.", "I think asking questions ahead of time was entirely reasonable. And I agree the makeup artist went too far, but it may have been out of anger at the bride lying to her about allergies. I don\u2019t think the situation would have played out any differently if you had brought it up in person at the trial instead of over email, because the problem wasn\u2019t the allergies or \u201cgoing behind her back\u201d, it was the bride lying on the forms.\n\nI imagine a worse scenario where you get stuck using the makeup artist at the actual wedding. You have a reaction, the MUA freaks out and fires the bride as a client right before the wedding. Now the bride has no makeup, the wedding is actually \u201cruined\u201d, and people blame you for sticking it out.", "Inexperience shouldn't matter. If they were properly qualified, then they should've had all that set up and available for you to access. It sounds like they weren't properly/at all qualified to me.\n\nSource: I worked with someone who was learning how to be a make up artist and the importance of making clients aware of hygiene, cross-contamination prevention and skin sensitivities policies were drilled into the students pretty much from the start.", "Well\u2026 you\u2019re not entirely TAH because Rika did lie to her! So it set a even worse framing for when you did ask. I forgot to mention that in the last comment! Please know my comment was meant kindly, wishing you the best.", "I mean all you can do is trial and error i guess, or get a second opinion. But i would recommend doing that like now rather than later so if your fav brand suddenly does become a trigger for you, you're not stuck at that point if your intention is to carry on wearing your current makeup style", "Yeah, even if they plan to use different brushes and thoroughly wash their hands between other bridesmaids and you, it's whether they can contractually agree not to make a mistake. That's a huge ask, and I completely understand them not wanting to agree to anything when they feel like they don't have enough information to judge the level of risk.", "NTA in this situation, but if you\u2019re expecting them to buy your specific brands to work on you, you\u2019re going to have to compensate them.  Even when they have huge carts of stuff, if you\u2019re allergic to something and YOU don\u2019t even know what it is, they sure aren\u2019t and I don\u2019t blame her for not wanting to work on you, not because you\u2019re an awful person, but the liability isn\u2019t worth it.", "No?? How did you get that from my comment?? I was ONLY going to do that if MUA didn't have makeup i knew that was safe for me. Many others pointed out I could also bring my makeup to the MUA and while that didn't occur to me, I would accept that if the MUA suggested that. \n\nI was happy to have my makeup done by someone else AS LONG AS they used products I knew were safe. Hell, I'd go makeup less if Rika preferred that over me doing my makeup.", "Your last paragraph is horrifying. Maybe I could mention this to Rika for some perspective.", "But you wouldn\u2019t answer the MUA\u2019s questions about which ingredients cause problems for you?", "It just seems weird that it had not occurred to you until people suggested it here that you could've brought your own makeup, rather than just asking what brands she used and then \"If she said no, I'd be able to go back to Rika in advance of the trial and wedding and say look the only option\" would be for you to do your own.", "\u2026because she\u2019s not sure. She has determined \u201csafe\u201d products, but doesn\u2019t know what the ingredients are specifically causing the reaction. There\u2019s a difference between refusing to answer and not knowing the answer.", "We don\u2019t always know what specific ingredients cause a reaction. And sometimes it\u2019s a combination of ingredients and sometimes its certain concentrations of a particular ingredients. \n\nIt\u2019s a can of worms and not always as straight forward as \u201cI\u2019m allergic to x, can you avoid it?!\u201d \n\nHence, bringing your own stuff or doing your own make up", "Because as I have said in my post, I was never able to determine specific ingredients that trigger this. Skin reactions are crazy complicated and not all of them are even allergic in nature.\n\n All I know are the products that are safe, which I've used without issue for years. If you picked up any other product on the market and gave it to me, I wouldn't know if it's safe for me until i slapped it on my eyes or lips.", "I assumed she doesn't know the exact ingredient that causes the issue. I have a bad reaction to many but not all milk products and lactase pills/lactose free pills don't do anything to help. So, pretty sure it's not lactose intolerance, but it's really not worth the expense of an allergy panel to learn the exact trigger when there's other stuff I know I can eat.", "And did you tell her \u201cxyz products are safe for me, but I\u2019ve had reactions from products abc\u201d?", "I am happy to let you know that you can go through expense of seeing various doctors and testing and they are still: idk, sucks for you, good luck.\n\ngod allergies are so frustrating.", "yes in general, no to naming specific products - because the moment i mentioned this she took over conversation and we never got anywhere near naming products. \n\nso if xyz are Safe Products, and abc are Unsafe Products, the sticking points were: \n\n1. I couldn't confirm whether any products but xyz were safe for me. \n2. I couldn't confirm what about products abc gave me reactions. \n3. I didn't have any info from a doctor about what type of reaction I had, and generally the info I gave was very vague and uncertain - because unfortunately that was all i had after my investigations and medical visits.", "Yeah, I've brought it up with SO many doctors over the years and they just shrug and tell me either lactose intolerance or milk allergy. I just took that as a signal that it's not worth my money to pursue. Did lead to a super funny conversation with my FIL where he asked if the issue might be \"gay-lactose\" and I had to fight not to out myself with a dumb pun. (It is pronounced \"gah-lactose\"...)"]}
