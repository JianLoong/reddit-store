Her main request to the bridesmaids was having hair and makeup done by the same HMUA (Rika paying) the morning of the wedding for the getting-ready hangout. Rika had her mind set on a specific HMUA that offered a fancy bridal experience with lots of extras and she was very excited about it.\n\nI wear bold, dramatic makeup daily. I had no issue sticking to Rika\u2019s very different preferred style for her wedding. However, over the last few years I had a number of painful reactions to make up products and I was never able to figure out the trigger. If I immediately take makeup off pain goes away in hours and discomfort fades in a few days. While reactions are rare, I now stick to specific make up lines I know work for me.\n\nI asked Rika if she could ask the HMUA what products they use; or I could do my own makeup while everyone else was getting theirs done (trying for the same look). But Rika just kept saying she had a reputable MUA that followed professional standards of hygiene, and that the makeup would be quite light. It seemed in her head, reactions could only happen with a shady MUA or heavy makeup.\n\nRika said she could pay for me to have a trial done on the same day she\u2019d have hers so I don't have to worry. I agreed like a dumbass, then realised that didn\u2019t work, because if the MUA used a triggering product, I would still have a painful reaction just on a different day. I messaged Rika again, and had the same pointless conversations.\n\nThe trial day was coming. I didn't want to just cancel\u2026 it made sense in my head to message the MUA with my question directly.\n\nUnexpectedly, the MUA straight up said she can't work on me for liability reasons as I cannot identify problem ingredients. Not even using products I name as safe. She also asked if the bride was aware. Turns out Rika had filled out a form that confirmed no one had known makeup sensitivities. I don't blame Rika, she signs medical and customs forms without reading them. But the MUA was enraged: she almost fired Rika as a client, 5 weeks ahead of the wedding (they worked it out; fwiw I haven\u2019t ever heard of a MUA with such forms or such a hardcore stance in general).\n\nRika and her maid of honour since implied I was intentionally sabotaging so I could do my usual \"attention grabbing\" makeup. I'm hoping that's MOH/ bride-stress talking and not what Rika really thinks of me.\n\nSeveral people told me I should\u2019ve just risked it, considering my reactions (and the chance of them occurring in the first place) are relatively minor. The more people say this, the more I'm thinking maybe that IS what is expected of a friend.\n\nObviously my worst move was messaging the MUA directly. But I wasn't getting anywhere with Rika and I was afraid that she'd be mad if I just said I wasn't doing the HMUA thing. But the more I think of it, going behind her back on something so important to her may make me the AH.\n\nETA: people keep asking about patch tasting: my reactions only trigger on my lips and eyelids, arm swatching or w/e doesn't help.\n\nETA2: i've been to doctors and had allergy testing done. Nothing. They think it's not a \"true\" allergy but a reaction to something my body finds particularly irritating for some reason. There's no obvious common ingredient. I have every outwards symptom for referred pollen energy but not an actual pollen allergy.

Perhaps your friend should have just let you do your own, but since your style is so different to what she wants, i can see why she wouldn't be super confident with that option. And the mua has a client who doesn't know what will set her off, so basically has to assume everything will and therefore buy whole new products and tools to ensure there's no cross contamination. \n\nMaybe showing your friend you can do her preferred style yourself will settle things down? \n\nAnd i realise that this won't often interfere with life and other people the way food allergies do, but it would probably still be worth really nailing down what is doing this to you.

As professional MUA myself who specializes in weddings and special occasions - there was no reason she couldn\u2019t use a specific brand that you mentioned doesn\u2019t irritate your skin or used your own products on you.

You could have simply had a conversation with the MUA at the trial run without actually getting your make up done. This way it didn't look like you went behind her back.

You not having an allergic reaction is an incredibly important safety thing, whether you have a mild one or not. \n\nIf she hadn't lied I doubt any of this would've happened. I work at a high end spa with a similar consent form that requires people to disclose any allergies or sensitivities to ingredients before we start.

The way Amazon warehouses store and sort goods mean even if a buyer purchases a legit good from a legit seller, they might end up with a knockoff. To my knowledge, Amazon has not addressed this deficit in their system; a deficit ingrained into how they designed and built their warehouses, storage systems, and response/ packing time. \n\nAlso, makeup that has been opened and then returned to the store often has fecal matter in it (people aren't smushing poo into it on purpose; they open the makeup in their bathroom and then leave it open in the bathroom and at some point flush the toilet, which basically spreads an invisible cloud of shit all over), which is apparently one of MANY reasons why makeup stores aren't supposed to resell returned makeup items but (surprise!) a lot of them are.\n\nAnyway, all this is to say, buying makeup online through Amazon or an unreliable source almost certainly means it is a knockoff with undisclosed lead or other heavy metals. Buying it from the clearance/ sale/ \"damaged goods\" section of retailers who will also accept returns means there is the possibility of fecal contamination.", "That\u2019s a pretty strong reaction and accusation they hurled at you for calling the MUA after your concerns were dismissed.

Honestly if you like make up then it\u2019s a risk you\u2019re taking long term as you don\u2019t know the trigger and of course you\u2019d be tempted to try a different item in the brand or the brand changes ingredients. A lot of make up is not regulated. The MUA covering herself legally is a great move for her to avoid any consequences like this.

Some time in the two years from when I got married to my SIL, I developed an allergy to mascara. It took me a while to narrow down what was causing the reaction (itchy skin around my eyes and an almost burning sensation - sadly a common reaction for me for an allergy) until I learned it was mascara. There was some ingredient in it that I was reacting to, and thus, I searched for a new one that I could try and not have reactions to. I found one brand, and at my SIL's wedding, I brought my own, asked the artist to use only that one, and...shocking she did. \n\nTo the OP, are you sure that your SIL signed documents stating that no one had known allergies etc etc?

These attempts failed, which is why she contacted the MUA directly. She actually did everything she needed to do in order to make sure that the day wouldn\u2019t be derailed by an allergic reaction to her makeup. And she was successful in doing so! She averted a potential medical disaster and saved the MUA from the risk of lawsuits by contacting her directly. \n\nShe should not have had to do *that* much work, because *it was the bride\u2019s responsibility* to make sure that the services she was booking would be safe for her wedding party, and address any concerns that her party had about those services in advance.
