The wedding had an elegant dress code, we had to wear formal full-length evening gowns, which was a nice choice. I bought a dress a few months ago specifically for this event, it was full-length as asked, and it had off-the-shoulder straps (I'm really bad at describing it), and it was also black, and quite pricey (it was hard to find a dress like this around me).\n\nA month before the event, my friend called me and told me she wants me to wear a dress that \"covers my ink\" to the wedding. I informed her I had already bought a dress for her wedding and reminded her that I sent her photos of it. She told me she just saw it and that she wanted me to find a different one. I told her I wasn't going to be able to return the dress I bought and she told me to suck it up and that I should've known she would've wanted me to cover my tattoos, even though she is heavily tattooed. I asked if she would pay me back for the dress as it was expensive and she had plenty of time to tell me her specific request and she told me no. I was a little angry, to say the least, but said okay.\n\nI couldn't find a dress that met her specific requests to save my life. I looked online and most of the top parts were lace and see-through, I am also allergic to lace, or it's an irritant at least (actually found this out while shopping for the original dress.). I went to shops all around town, even travelled out of my way to look at boutiques, and still couldn't find anything.\n\nThe day before the wedding came and I called her multiple times, but she didn't pick up. I called her house, and her fiance/husband picked up, I explained that I couldn't find a dress to cover all my tattoos and that I wouldn't be able to come to the wedding. He told me she would want me to be there, and not only that the reservations will be messed up if I don't come. I told him I didn't want to cause any drama and would rather not come. He told me it was nonsense and told me to show up, it won't matter at the end of the day.\n\nI did show up and wore a shawl over my shoulder to at least attempt to hide the tattoos. And all I got were side eyes from her and daggers. She's still pissed off at me for not being able to meet her request, but her husband and the rest of our friends think that her requests were out of line.", "created_utc": 1675865846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wxtgd/aita_for_wearing_a_short_sleeve_dress_to_a_wedding/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not acting like there is no way to cover them as I looked into quite a lot of different solutions. A month was not enough.", "As a makeup artist you have no idea what you are talking about.

I really only cared about my bridesmaids having the same dress and when we were choosing the dress, I was particular about the color because it was a very specific shade of blue that was my wedding color but I was happy to find it was a surprisingly common dress color just not flower.
