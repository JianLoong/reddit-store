The wedding had an elegant dress code, we had to wear formal full-length evening gowns, which was a nice choice. I bought a dress a few months ago specifically for this event, it was full-length as asked, and it had off-the-shoulder straps (I'm really bad at describing it), and it was also black, and quite pricey (it was hard to find a dress like this around me).\n\nA month before the event, my friend called me and told me she wants me to wear a dress that \"covers my ink\" to the wedding. I informed her I had already bought a dress for her wedding and reminded her that I sent her photos of it. She told me she just saw it and that she wanted me to find a different one. I told her I wasn't going to be able to return the dress I bought and she told me to suck it up and that I should've known she would've wanted me to cover my tattoos, even though she is heavily tattooed. I asked if she would pay me back for the dress as it was expensive and she had plenty of time to tell me her specific request and she told me no. I was a little angry, to say the least, but said okay.\n\nI couldn't find a dress that met her specific requests to save my life. I looked online and most of the top parts were lace and see-through, I am also allergic to lace, or it's an irritant at least (actually found this out while shopping for the original dress.). I went to shops all around town, even travelled out of my way to look at boutiques, and still couldn't find anything.\n\nThe day before the wedding came and I called her multiple times, but she didn't pick up. I called her house, and her fiance/husband picked up, I explained that I couldn't find a dress to cover all my tattoos and that I wouldn't be able to come to the wedding. He told me she would want me to be there, and not only that the reservations will be messed up if I don't come. I told him I didn't want to cause any drama and would rather not come. He told me it was nonsense and told me to show up, it won't matter at the end of the day.\n\nI did show up and wore a shawl over my shoulder to at least attempt to hide the tattoos. And all I got were side eyes from her and daggers. She's still pissed off at me for not being able to meet her request, but her husband and the rest of our friends think that her requests were out of line.\n\nEdit 1: I was not part of the bridal party, I was offered right at the beginning but I knew I wouldn't be able to dedicate as much time as everyone else since I am in school becoming a Nurse Practitioner, and I also work as a nurse doing 12's and sometimes more.\n\nEdit 2: I know a lot of people say you can't be allergic to lace, just saying the bodily reaction I had was very similar to an allergic reaction, I broke out into hives and almost scratched my skin raw when I tried on a dress with lace sleeves and lace top.

She should have requested it when she set the dress code and actually made it part of the dress code. Not a month before the wedding after you already bought a dress. It sounds like an awesome dress. Plus, you wore a shawl. There can't be a lot that was showing.\n\nPlus, being a tattooed person as well, it is hard AF to find anything formal to cover all your tattoos. I've tried, I've failed. Were there others with tattoos showing? Just curious.\n\nShe needs to get over it.", "It\u2019s not your job to assume her desired dress code.

Either way, NTA", "NTA.\n\nPeople are allowed to make requests for their weddings but this seems far too hypocritical. You did good by sending the dress and pointing out many times how you tried to find one but couldn't. You also were very considerate to think on not attending, even though this is your friend.

She's also not your friend. You went far, and I mean very, very far beyond what should be expected of a wedding guest, to accomodate her frankly extremely ridiculous requests.\n\nI don't love most tattoos. The older I get, the more I think most of them are pretty silly and pointless. That said, if I want you at my wedding, obviously I wouldn't give a shit about your tattooed state, or your clothing choice, and you could wear your pajamas for all I would care. I'm fairly radical, so even wear white if you want lol, and I probably won't even notice. If she didn't want tattooed people at her wedding, she shouldn't have invited them (kinda more weird if she also has them though).\n\nWeddings are busy. The couple usually doesn't get more than a few fleeting moments with each guest, and most guests are usually zeroed in on the couple the whole time, so most other people aren't paying attention to you either. Usually the couple just wants everyone to have a good time and witness and share in their good time. It's all typically a very wholesome sentiment, at least as far as I have experienced.\n\nMy suggestion for next time, and anyone else that comes across a weird wedding like this, is to simply decline or recind the invitation if something like this comes up. If you don't feel welcome at their event, save yourself the hassle and just don't go.\n\nIt was once requested of me to cut my hair in order to participate in a wedding. I did not participate in that bullshit wedding. Someone else's wedding is not about me. If they try to make it about me, I'm out, and they're also probably out of my life.

Everyone else had their tattoos showing.", "Nope, nobody else needed to cover their tattoos just me.", "It's true, seeing all the wedding posts on here makes me think weddings make people overly stressed and they do things they wouldn't normally do.", "Dam are you so wrong on your high horse.", "And since it was that long ago, in hindsight it probably all looks weird now. :P which is part of the fun!", "Unless the bride has developed a grudge on you (for whatever reason, like believing a nasty rumor about you) and decided to force you to not attend by making you have to get a new dress on short notice (kind of a stretch, but reddit has featured worse plans), it could be as the other commenter suggested.\n\nAre your tattoos more beautiful compared to the bride's (and compared to the rest of the tattooed guests)?", "Still NTA. She knew about your tattoos. It would be different if you\u2019ve done them between being invited and wedding, but that\u2019s clearly not the case. \nIt\u2019s just an option for future events. \nMy friend has a beautiful custom made dress. I saw her wearing it few times. And it exactly for her (height, weight, and bottom and bust). Best decision.", "Yeah definitely NTA.", "Have you asked her why she made this request of you and no one else? You are NTA either way I\u2019m just confused.", "Good point about the difficulty in even finding formal wear that\u2019s completely covered in less you want to look like the MOB.  My daughter is very chesty and just finding a party dress she can wear with a regular bra is darn near impossible.  If it\u2019s not strapless,  it\u2019s backless or designed in some other way that rules out most bras that are capable of supporting her bust.  I\u2019ve worked in bridal and know the power of the seamstress and good underpinnings.", "If you had the chance to stuff a little kid into an adorable tux...

I sometimes miss the comments too!", "The groom is your friend too, right? Maybe talk to him. It's his wedding and his friend too, he deserves to know how weird she is acting.

But it would be a shame if you lost him as a friend too just because his wife is weird.", "He is my friend too, yes.

You did nothing wrong.\n\nSo tired of this wedding/bridezilla/groomzilla nonsense, it is getting so out of hand.", "NTA\n\nI'm going to be downvoted for this but... there are a lot of ugly tattoos out there. *Your* tattoos sound lovely. I'm speculating that perhaps the bride was worried about being upstaged at her wedding by your tattoos, because yours are prettier than hers?  \n\nNo matter her \"reason\" though, you did your best dress appropriately. That's all anyone can ask.\n\nBoth of my *bridemaids* were could-be-models gorgeous (I am not), and I purposefully picked out dresses that would make *them* look their best. Every bride shines on her wedding day. There's no need to hog the spotlight; it's already there. You weren't even in the wedding party! So whatever her insecurities, they were entirely unnecessary. *She's* the one that detracted from her own day. I'll never understand it.", "NTA. You did your best to comply. Wore a shawl. You were not in the wedding party. Her fiancee cleared you coming. She is not much of a friend. Did she cover all her tats?", "This whole wedding thing/bridezilla is really weird", "NTA! You didn't even have to get a new dress but you went out of your way to look for one anyways and tried to compromise with what you had, I think that's the best (and even above) what you could do here.", "Edit 2-I can't wear lace either. It's not an allergy but the itching and welts sure make it feel that way.\n\nNTA you did your best and even offered to stay home.", "NTA. This is quite literally some of the weirdest shit I have ever heard.

I've been in bridal parties where my full sleeve shows, the bride didn't care because she was tattooed as well.", "Ynta, but you Are TA for being insincere about trying to find other options.  If you wanted to you could have worn a shrug or cardigan over the dress.

In addition to that I WORE A SHAWL.

When I was young only sailors had tattoos.", "A pretty shrug or cardigan ordered off the internet would have covered it.  Weaponized incompetence is not a good look.", "It's hard finding a formal dress that even has short sleeves.  I have a scar on my arm from a car accident many years ago.
