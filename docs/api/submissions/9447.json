The wedding had an elegant dress code, we had to wear formal full-length evening gowns, which was a nice choice. I bought a dress a few months ago specifically for this event, it was full-length as asked, and it had off-the-shoulder straps (I'm really bad at describing it), and it was also black, and quite pricey (it was hard to find a dress like this around me).\n\nA month before the event, my friend called me and told me she wants me to wear a dress that \"covers my ink\" to the wedding. I informed her I had already bought a dress for her wedding and reminded her that I sent her photos of it. She told me she just saw it and that she wanted me to find a different one. I told her I wasn't going to be able to return the dress I bought and she told me to suck it up and that I should've known she would've wanted me to cover my tattoos, even though she is heavily tattooed. I asked if she would pay me back for the dress as it was expensive and she had plenty of time to tell me her specific request and she told me no.

I called her house, and her fiance/husband picked up, I explained that I couldn't find a dress to cover all my tattoos and that I wouldn't be able to come to the wedding. He told me she would want me to be there, and not only that the reservations will be messed up if I don't come. I told him I didn't want to cause any drama and would rather not come. He told me it was nonsense and told me to show up, it won't matter at the end of the day.\n\nI did show up and wore a shawl over my shoulder to at least attempt to hide the tattoos. And all I got were side eyes from her and daggers. She's still pissed off at me for not being able to meet her request, but her husband and the rest of our friends think that her requests were out of line.\n\nEdit 1: I was not part of the bridal party, I was offered right at the beginning but I knew I wouldn't be able to dedicate as much time as everyone else since I am in school becoming a Nurse Practitioner, and I also work as a nurse doing 12's and sometimes more.", "created_utc": 1675865846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wxtgd/aita_for_wearing_a_short_sleeve_dress_to_a_wedding/", "score": 310, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nobody is going to remember what anyone wore a week after the wedding.  Weddings are just trials to get through and then forget all about.  Wedding albums get passed down to the next generation or two and 9 times out of 10 get tossed.  So, there won't even be any photo evidence of what you wore.", "Goodnight! Some people... NTA. That was so ridiculous,  she saw the dress, won't pay for it, and just all around sounds like a bridezilla. Sorry your friend wasn't appreciative of you walking around in backbends for her.", "NTA  It's absurd for a bride to think she can control the exact dress a guest wears.", "NTA- this is very weird for your friend to request.", "NTA. It sounds like you did everything you could and she needs to get over it.", "NTA\n\nJesus, weddings turn brides into terrible people.", "YTA for lying because give me a break. 80% of the dresses at Target are 3/4 length sleeves and I know that as I used to work there. You could have very very easily found a dress that would have covered your body art, you just didn\u2019t want to. Own your mistakes, people will respect you more.", "Mild YTA. \"Formal\" dress typically includes no visible tats, or a least minimizing their visibility. Kind of like how if male guests show up to a Formal in anything other than a Tux they're the asshole. On that note, my brother is sleeved on three limbs with a cutoff just below where his cuff rests. 360 days a year the tats are fully visible, the handful of times a year when he has to attend a Formal in his dress uniform, a tux, or a suit he meets the dress code. \n\nYou can argue that the dress code for a Formal is classist, but it hasn't really changed since King George IV ruled England.", "NAH. When you have a lot of tattoos, some people aren't going to enjoy looking at them, especially at formal events. \nThat's tattoo life.", "ESH I say that because you wore the dress after she specifically told you not to. It\u2019s her wedding absurd request or not it was her rule and you didn\u2019t respect that. You should have simply not gone to the wedding when you were unable to find a replacement dress. I\u2019m not gonna lie her last minute change is a major AH move and so was her attitude towards you. But she made it clear that dress wasn\u2019t welcome. If you\u2019d shown up and she was mad after the fact without knowing about her not liking the dress it would have been different. But knowingly going against those wishes makes you an ah too.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I would've wanted to be able to dedicate the time if I was a bridesmaid but I would rather her have people that would be able to give her the time she wants etc. So I was a guest.", "Completely agree.", "Exactly, it's not making sense to me either! This is why I'm also confused too.", "She didn't give me anything apart from the request.", "Exactly, thank you.", "I went because I was under the guise that the groom also informed her of the situation too though, because he told me to come and not miss the wedding.", "I can understand that it is a stressful time for them, and sometimes they can become irrational, I know planning something and wanting it to be perfect is what everyone wants out of their big day. If I had more time or more notice I would've been able to either find a replacement dress, or even gotten the dress I currently had altered to get sleeves fitted onto it or something.", "Once again another person who didn't read the post. It was a formal wedding, full-length dresses, extravagant etc. It really seems like you overlooked the entire post and decided not to focus on ALL the details I gave. 3/4 length sleeves don't cover everything firstly, second, we don't have Target here and regardless it wouldn't have met the conditions that she had already placed prior to the request to cover my tattoos.", "What mistake? Wtf are you even talking about?", "I hate this idea that tattoos are to be hidden. Or that they are tacky. It's gross.", "There\u2019s nothing reasonable about the request whatsoever. There\u2019s literally no correlation between covering tattoos and the wedding being affected in any way.", "But when more than 50% of the people attending had visible tattoos and only I was told to go buy a new dress there seems to be something going on.", "JFC.", "Wasn't mentioned until there was only a month left before the wedding, if it was the case it should've been said from the get-go. And on top of that nobody else got these instructions.", "I couldn't find a different dress in time, and found a shawl that covered my back tattoo, and my arm tattoos, just not the chest one. I couldn't find a dress that covered all of my tattoos, and on top of that I think you missed the part where I attempted to inform the bride I wasn't coming, couldn't get in contact, called their house, and the groom who is also a friend told me to come regardless.", "NTA. Can I ask where this wedding was held? Because where I live, tattoos are so common that it would be weird if you didn't see at least one person at a wedding wearing a dress that showed theirs off.", "I remember two from ours - my niblings - because one was dressed as a fairy and one had a tiny tuxedo (he looked like a tiny mafioso). It wasn't a formal dress wedding btw - even I wasn't wearing a tuxedo lol.", "Own your mistakes, people will respect you more.", "To me it's not too much different than black tie/white tie cocktail dress/evening dress. And there are religious venues where visible tattoos are frowned upon or outright forbidden (desecration of the human form and all), so if getting married in such a place I can see it being a reasonable request. I would have no interest in such a level of detail over my wedding guests, however to each their own. But again, I don't think the way the request was made in this particular case was reasonable, so it's a moot point.", "And now I like you even more. RNs FTW!!!", "I mean fundamentally you did what you could already....above and beyond really. You got a dress, you sent her pictures.  She approved.  She changed her mind with a month to go, you tried to find something else even going out of town and even offered to not appear if it would cause that much drama for her.  Her husband (also his wedding!) wanted you to be there to celebrate their marriage, and you even put on a shawl.  You have exhausted all of the solutions necessary for someone's one evening of me me me.\n\nHad you actually not shown up, she would have gotten bitter and turned it even worse probably saying \"she was so not interested in trying that it was easier for her to not show up.\"  It would have been a lose-lose in any situation.  Hopefully she debridezilla's and gets over it.", "I totally understand! One thing that came to my mind in all this was that sometimes brides just aren't in their right minds. Weddings are HELLA stressful, and sometimes we just crack. \n\nWhen I was getting married my mother, unbeknownst to me, was festooning a basket for my niece (flower girl) to walk with down the aisle. Mom, very proudly, texted me a picture of the basket and it was absolutely dripping with ribbons and some sprays of fake flowers, and I lost my mind. Initially I thought she was joking, and when it became clear she wasn't I laid into her about how ugly it was and how couldn't it just be a simple thing, on and on. OVER RIBBONS! She simplified the basket, and it was lovely, and everything was just fine in the end. And a few weeks later I apologized for cussing her out, over fucking ribbons. Hopefully this was just a release valve for some of the pressure she's been under, and that you get a similar apology down the line.", "I\u2019m so sorry about this. Do you think once things calm down that you might try to have a heart to heart conversation with her? It\u2019s just sad to see a friendship fizzle out over this and it really does seem like there\u2019s more going on here.", "Yeah, definitely NTA. She sounds dramatic tbh.", "You did great!\n\n\"Wanting it to be perfect\" I think is the key. This probably isn't a realistic expectation.", "I reside in Canada, and in addition to that almost every other person had their tattoos exposed.", "Not naked?  Killjoy!  Hee Hee", "Because I tried to accommodate a request and when I tried to tell them I couldn't come the groom (who is also my friend) told me to come as they would want my support regardless. I wore a shawl that covered almost all of my tattoos except for my chest. God forbid one tattoo is showing when there is a sea of others who had tattoos there showing them right.", "Just to put it out there, they didn't get married at a church, their friend did the officiating (? can't remember if that's the word)", "Thank you thank you.", "It would've been a lose-lose situation, you're 100% right.", "I was thinking of doing that honestly, we have been friends for quite some time, I would like to have a heart to heart and see what happened between when she invited me to when she put conditions on what I was wearing, but I also don't want to possibly make it worse", "I would understand if she gave me much more notice, or even told me right when she invited me to the wedding so I could have more time to find a better solution than a shawl...Not the case.", "Yeah that wouldn't have looked tacky at all!", "To you maybe. To someone that has a time demanding job like OP with restrictions on what she can wear because of allergies, it's not. If the bride wanted Tattoos  to be covered, she should have said so from the start, and not after she knew a dress has already been bought. She even had pictures of the dress, but never bothered to say anything.", "I'm so confused. So the bride is tattooed. Many of the guests were tattooed. You are tattooed. But you were singled out to cover your tattoos? And you wore a shawl, which isn't a perfect solution, but shows you absolutely put in effort to meet her expectations. \n\nIs she normally controlling like this? Is she jealous of your tattoos? This just doesn't make a lot of sense. I'm sorry you're in this position. It sounds like she would've found something to be upset about regardless. \n\nNTA.", "[removed]", "You didn't make any mistakes. You made more accomodations than you needed to!", "It wasn't a perfect solution, but it was the only thing I could do to try and respect what she wanted out of me. \n\nShe has never been this way before, I don't know if she is jealous, I have absolutely no idea. It doesn't make sense to me either, and it honestly really hurt me as nobody else got these instructions, just me.", "Yeah, I don't get why people get so hung up on what other people wear! Our best man wore the suit he got married in as it was Navy blue and we were going for blue and purple. My husband's suit was more Royal Blue as he liked that when we went to try suits on so they didn't even match! I only had 2 bridesmaids, but we went to a shop and I picked the colour, and then let them pick the style they wanted - so their dresses were the same colour, but were a style they were comfortable with (one had a one-shouldered style and the other had floaty sleeves)", "I tried to accommodate her request and tried my best with the time I had to try and find a solution.", "/u/Feesedgh is a comment-stealing bot.

I want to know as well. This is also the reason why I included the description of my tattoos too. All of them were super expensive and done extremely well.", "Obviously you were NTA (who tries to micro-manage what a guest wears?) but in the future if you want to wear that dress somewhere and you want/need to cover your arms look up \"sleevey wonders\" on amazon.  They are basically like a tight fitting crop top with sleeves that you can wear under another garment to give it temporary sleeves.  They sell them in different materials and colors including solid black.", "Well, I think I can wholeheartedly say bride, AH. You NTA. Here's hoping she tells you the truth at some point so you can put it to rest."]}
