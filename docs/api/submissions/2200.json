M has always been a bubbly and sweet girl. The bridesmaid, M's sister, is also a sweetie-pie and we hang out a lot as well. M also invited all her female cousins to be her bridesmaids as well. One of them, Y, has been on my nerves as soon as I am aware of her involvement.\n\nBasically, it all started when Y accompanied M to her makeup trial appointment as according to M, Y is a makeup enthusiast and could probably give constructive feedback to the look. Originally, M's sister was supposed to be going to the appointment as well but due to covid restrictions, only one guest can attend the appointment with the bride. M said she chose Y in the end cause she felt that, and I quote, \"Y might get really angry and make a scene if I called her all the way out for the appointment and not let her oversee it\". However, according M's sister, the makeup made M looked really tired and old, but Y insisted M looked amazing in it. But Y apparently defended and said M is supposed to look older for her wedding day since she currently looked too much like a baby.\n\nThe bridesmaids decided to organise a day to get all our dresses in one go. An hour after we started, Y finally arrived, no hi, no sorry i'm late, just stormed in and said I want this dress help me get it. While we were waiting to get our measurements, M decided to let Y know she will be changing her makeup artist because she really didn't feel right with the previous one. M is a small girl, and she was already hunching a bit when she told Y that. Y, being a bigger girl, literally towered over M and demanded \"Why not the previous one? I told you she is good! You should follow my advice!\" M was already huddled in a corner and I couldn't let this go on, so I stepped up and said \"hey technically it's none of your business. if she didn't like it then she has every right to change.\" Y just glanced at me and said \"But I like it so she should follow me!\" She continued \"She hasn't even tried the new one yet right? How would she know whether she'll like this new one?\" So I said \"Well doesn't matter because at least we know she didn't like the previous one.\u201d\n\nThe next day, I got a text from M saying Y demanded an apology that night because we were mean and made her upset. M started explaining that Y was abused as a kid and didn't really know how to communicate properly with people, plus she was always considered the glam and pretty one of the family so she's very defensive with her opinions when it came to fashion and beauty. I said I wouldn't say sorry because I was just trying to defend a friend when Y overstepped her boundaries. M said she thinks I am edging into a manic episode because I have been very grumpy recently. She also said I should just avoid conflict with Y from now on because Y was really hurt that time and I was the one in the wrong and should be on my meds again.

Good on you for making the nonsense stop.", "**NTA** I am the bride who was not allowed to do my own makeup OR have the person I wanted and trusted, and bullied ON MY WEDDING DAY, into a MU EXACTLY like Y who made me look tired, old, and horrible, and no, I wasn't allowed to wash my face and fix it myself, either. Almost ten years later, it's the ONLY thing I regret.", "NTA. This bridesmaid was bullying the bride and you stood up to her. Sure, it might have lead to an uncomfortable moment, and yes it might have been better to have that conversation away from others, but sometimes you have to step in to stop a bully in the moment.\n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s also kind of an AH move to suggest you did this because of your mental health. Bride has clearly enabled Y\u2019s behaviour for years, perhaps because she\u2019s scared of her. It\u2019s interesting to me that the bride says allowances have to he made for Y because she\u2019s suffered abuse in the past, but is quick to criticise your actions which she thinks might have been caused by your mental health.\n\nDefinitely avoid conflict from Y going forward, but also have a good think if you want to be part of the wedding party at all.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately M, the bride, sides with her bully because she feels sorry for Y's past trauma. Y was bullied as a child, and is now doing the same to others.\n\nProblem is, this is not your wedding. You did your best, defended your friend etc. However the bride decides what to do. And it seems she's deciding Y will manage her wedding.\n\nSo, now you have a choice. Accept that you're there for the bride, no matter how wrong she is lol, and support her and her stupid decisions, or, step out of the bridal party. \n\nM has already chosen, she supports Y while she told you that you \"need to go back on your meds\", which is a really shitty thing to say.\n\nIf you decide to continue as a bridesmaid, you need to apologize to keep the peace (a fake apology, just for appearances, but the words need to come our of your mouth). Because, remember, you are there to support the bride.", "NTA\n\nBut you have to decide if this is the hill to die on when your friend - the bride - isn\u2019t willing to.\n\nPersonally, I would request an apology in turn. She was just as rude and I think you could both talk and agree that you\u2019re there to support M and that you\u2019ll let her make her own decisions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She literally used your own health against you in order to further enable her shitty cousin and this was only the choosing of the dresses! Are you sure you want to put yourself in a position to be the scapegoat for every little thing? Because that's likely what will happen...cousin won't wanna go to the bach or the showers...there will have to be a person sat between you and she won't want to be in pictures with you...it WILL snowball...I feel bad for your friend that her cousin would act that way \ud83d\ude14 and bad for you that she then got upset with the wrong person \ud83d\udc4c", "ESH.

Your mental health is hugely important. \n\nI don't think it costs you anything to apologize to Y. You did what needed to be done at the time and now you can let it go. You understand more about her abrasive behaviour so tuck that info into the back of your mind for future encounters. M would like peace between people so that's the thing I'd say is the most important right now.", "NTA. Y is a nightmare and M should think seriously about why she is enabling that kind of behaviour.\n\nY is an adult now and can't use childhood bullying as an excuse to treat other people like crap. \nM was nasty to bring your mental health into it. If she was worried about your mental health she should have raised it as a separate issue.\n\nWhat you said wasn't even rude.", "NTA she was rude and horrible and yet you should be thinking about her feelings!\n\nWhat about your feelings when you tried to protect your friend and now your been told its a you problem and you should go back on your meds.\n\nId be more concerned you were treated like that not that you yelled at her.", "Nta!! Y Is a bully", "NTA\nIs M getting married or Y? Good for you for standing up for your friend. \nI know enough abused people (and am one myself) and none off them are behaving like bullies or don't have to take accountability for their actions btw. Sucks that here childhood sucked, but none off you are responsible for that are you? Keep advocating for M.", "Y got hurt because her pride took a dent, it's not about shat happened in the past, it was the present situation you where dealing with an using her abuse as an excuse is completely unfair on everyone else in this wowho has been abused an has put alot of work into themselves healing thier trauma. She's being a horrible controlling bullying person who is quite possibly not wanted as a bridesmaid but the bride is to scared to tell her, talk to the bride tell her your not going to apologise for somebody else's bad behaviour, an that watching a friend be bullied is very difficult for you that you felt compelled to act and get this bullying nasty person to back off", "Thanks! I was just trying to stand up for a friend. Anyone would do the same.", "I\u2019m sorry this happened to you on your big day. Naturally we would all want everything to be perfect but it just sucks when someone decided to bully you into pleasing them instead of you doing what you want. I hope something similar never happened to you.", "I actually told the bride I will just avoid any interaction with Y moving forwards. We don\u2019t see each other anyway even during the planning stages and probably won\u2019t be sitting next to each other during the reception. We both decided me and Y are like oil and water and the more we talk to each other, trouble will just happen.", "Someone who's bipolar doesn't always recognize when a manic episode is beginning, so it's actually helpful to have people point it out.", "Yea I made a promise I will not even interact with Y moving forwards but I won\u2019t apologise. She understands. She just wanted to fight her own battles and make sure no further drama happens.", "Tbh I don\u2019t think Y will apologise so that\u2019s the hill I will stay. M and I agreed I will let her fight her own battles from now on but she will lmk if she needed back up.", "Tbh i\u2019m not blaming my friend because she\u2019s works in mental health so she\u2019s aware of my conditions and such and said that out of concern so I\u2019m not too offended by it (doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t hurt).

I'm also in the queue for a new therapist dw", "My current meds for mania is actually too strong to the point I\u2019ll fall asleep even during a conversation, not ideal when you talk to people for a living. My previous therapist knew about this and prescribed me milder ones but for a need to take basis. Due to financial reasons, I had to stop seeing my therapist and currently queuing for a public one, which can take months. Though I\u2019m pretty sure my interaction with Y wasnt due to mania, because everyone else there was quite angry too but I was the only one who decided to step up and say something, which is still not too out of character for me.", "Oh. TL;DR, that complete hag of trash took itself out when I had a baby the following year.", "That\u2019s fair. I still think it\u2019s rather unfair that you\u2019re being chastised though - or at least, the only one. I hope you\u2019re not planning on giving that apology!", "Seems an insensitive way to do it in this context though", "I agree - I have been feeling a bit wobbly these days but it\u2019s probably because work has been quite stressful too. I\u2019m pretty sure when the incident happened I was very sound and I made a conscious decision to step in. But a therapist is being booked I am just in the queue.", "You also have to consider that Y is family and you are not. That might not matter to everyone but if M invited all of her female relatives to be in the wedding party, it tells me family is important to her. It\u2019s wise to not get in the middle of other family\u2019s problems. No matter how overbearing Y was, you probably were never going to win that round.", "Her working in mental health care makes it worse...not better...that wasn't concern for you...that was her dismissing her cousin's own issues and pitting yours against you...", "Love it when trash takes themselves out", "Oh, I agree, this isn't the greatest example of it.", "I wish you all the luck!", "As far as I\u2019m concerned you made the right decision", "So, my old friends like to have a holiday gathering when we can, and it was my best friend's father's last Christmas, and my kid's first. So naturally we worked it all out to have it at their house, so we could spend time with him, too. And we worked out okay, the pack and play can go in the bedroom when he gets tired, all that. As we're walking up to the house, I hear Trash SCREAMING about how much she hates babies and I had ruined everything. When we got into the room, I was already fuming. And then she made one nasty comment adter another ABOUT AN INFANT. Like hadn't even sat down to dinner (which my partner had made, because he is THE best cook) and she was ORDERING me to leave with \"that stupid little brat\". As if it was HER house. He was an infant FFS! We had a plan for that! He slept for hours just as soundly as I had in that house, many times, for many years. The fuck! So, uh, yeah. Trash took itself out. My kid is almost eight and trash hasn't seen him since. \ud83d\ude02", "Wow!  And you consider M a \u201cfriend\u201d?  If she wants to cower to this bully, let her but she has no right to demand that you apologize for defending her.  Now, M is using your mental health against you to make you think you are wrong.  I wouldn\u2019t apologize but I might tell M that you will stay out of all wedding issues unless they directly impact you.  M is a big girl and if she wants to look old and tired on her wedding day all so the family bully gets her way, then that\u2019s her decision.  Btw, you all know the bully wants M to look bad, right?", "lmao are you M? you sure sound like her", "Honey she wasn't concerned about you. She weaponized your condition to attack you.", "In what way?", "By telling OP to take her meds when it was CLEARLY not the point of the post. Her standing up for a friend is not a sign she isn't taking her meds. M used OP's condition to attack her and now you're doing the same."]}
