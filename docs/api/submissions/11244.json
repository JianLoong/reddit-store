Unless you did something like lean over and scream in her ear or grab the steering wheel it's all on her.\n\nThat's why we wait until people turn 16 to allow them to drive on public roadways in my country.

Your sister had no right to accuse you of something you didn't do.  Unfortunately, her behavior was condoned in the past when you were told to \"be the bigger person\" and not stand up to her for bullying you.  Just because you didn't retaliate didn't mean Riley would not find ways to belittle you.  From what was written in this post, Riley took a complaint you had and made it about her so she could seem like the victim.", "NTA\n\nThat's one of the most absurd arguments I've ever heard.

Any normal person would be mostly concerned about if their younger sister is okay.", "NTA. But you know this and it's so long ago there's not even a need to defend yourself. Your sister is just petty af. I think she tried to \"one up\" you on who had the higher car insurance (again because she's petty) and felt the need to make you the bad guy.  \n\nAlso, just curious - at the time it happened or any other time since did she claim this to be your fault?  If You were ever a possible issue surely would have been brought up at the time.", "NTA. You were children and it sounds like she shouldn't have been driving, let alone driving _you_. That isn't her fault though that's your moms.", "NTA but your sister is. Not being able to take responsibility for her own behavior is alarming though I\u2019m not terribly surprised since it seems she bullied you with no intervention.

There\u2019s a reason insurance premiums are higher for teens. You were both ok afterwards.

It slightly depends how you said it - if you'd yelled 'you're delusional' in a really harsh, accusing way that would be a bit AH, but from what you've written, I'd say NTA - it wasn't your fault that your sister crashed the car if you were only texting, and a safe driver shouldn't be distracted by that.\n\nShe does seem to have had an extreme reaction to a comment about something that happened 9 years ago - is there anything more to that story?

In case she forgot she had 2 kids, not one, and allowing 1 to bully and blame the other for everything is just wrong.
