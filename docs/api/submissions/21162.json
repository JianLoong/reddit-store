Matted hair becomes extremely painful. It literally twists the skin, can cause infections and hematomas.

Thank you for caring for your furry neighbors.", "NTA - Matting that bad is a serious health risk for the rabbit.  It would have been preferrable to call the neighbor and offer to fix the problem, but it seems obvious they just don't care about their pets.  I would have taken pictures of everything (before shaving) and reported them for animal abuse.", "NTA\n\nOP seems really just worried for the health of the rabbits and just did what they thought was right. They just wanted to help and ofc they shouldve told the neighbors fault but nonetheless theyre still not the ahole.", "NTA. Those animals were suffering, and you helped alleviate some of that suffering. It might be worth it, when your neighbors get home, to talk to them about proper rabbit care.", "This could be my favourite title ever.. Obviously, they are AHs for leaving their rabbits like that. But they are still your parents' neighbours' rabbits. Not yours to decide. You should have messaged them asking if it was OK or waited for them to come back and ask. Unless the rabbits were in a serious state, in which case call the relevant authorities.", "I worked in grooming and I know how painful and awful matts are, especially in these sort of situation. However you can\u2019t shave peoples animals without the owner consent. I would have called to ask. It\u2019s also very risky to shave matts off rabbits with their thin skin, and could be disastrous.

But it is one them.  They neglected the rabbits in the first place.\n\nNTA", "Nta - your mom is valuing her friendship over the health of defenseless animals. That's not okay.", "I used to have to shave my long haired cat as she'd get painful mats(She would not allow me to brush her, esp where the mats would form).", "I was just so shocked because they had long hair cats and they never looked like this (granted cats groom better than rabbits) but yeah there was no way the wife didn\u2019t know since the animals are very handled and held all the time", "I feel bad for putting my parents in awkward position but the one was actually impacted in the butt and wasn\u2019t pooping enough. I don\u2019t think they will be that angry since it wasn\u2019t the entirety of the bunny just the back end but I know I took a major risk", "Yeah my parents are very close with them so they would never have reported them to animal control. I know I was wrong for having over stepped but the Matt was literally as big as the animal.", "I know I\u2019m wrong for not asking first, and to be honest I bet they would have said yes since they aren\u2019t show rabbits or particular people (obviously because they were in such bad shape) but I don\u2019t think I was completely wrong. Plus it\u2019s not like I shaved it completely bald, just the worst of the Matt\u2019s, there were still many more that need to be taken care of.", "Yeah I think my anger from the situation clouded my judgement. I mean the rabbit is fine and it\u2019s on the back end that was shaved but still it was horrible", "I think calling the authorities on your neighbors rabbits when they\u2019re out of town would be a bigger AH move than just shaving them imo", "I don't understand why a phone call would have hurt. Or even offering to \"groom them during their stay.\" With a nudge that the rabbits need it every once in a while. YTA for putting your parents in a situation that they can be sued for. There owners could lose. But they can still take it to small claims for several hundred dollars.", "Yeah I asked my mother to contact them but she said she didn\u2019t feel right calling them while they were gone. You\u2019re right how I completely over stepped. I didn\u2019t shave the entirety of the rabbit but that doesn\u2019t make up for over stepping", "I really want to but I know I\u2019ll leave that up to my parents at least. My mother said she\u2019d talk with the neighbor wife (they are literal besties so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s unwarranted advice from a stranger) about how she was worried about about the animals health.", "I don't think you understand what matting does to animals. It's painful, uncomfortable, and downright cruel.", "Right me getting animal control involved would have destroyed parents relationships but I know my mother also felt terrible about the matting. I spoke with her how if the neighbors are angry to completely blame me for over stepping but yeah I honestly don\u2019t see the neighbors being that upset", "And it is SOO bad and urgent, making it impossible to pick up the phone and diskussit and ask for permission before doing something to someone else's pets?", "The thing about not involving animal control is what happens when the neighbors get back and are the sole carers again? Do you think this was due to ignorance and that if you talk to them about proper care they'll start treating the rabbits properly? If so, you should reach out to them asap and let them know that you noticed the matted fur, what damage that does and therefore you shaved off the affected areas. Then educate them about proper care. They should be told about the shaving before they come home and find out for themselves. If you don't think that will help, animal control NEEDS to get involved because it won't be long before the rabbits are in the same state they were before.", "Actually yes it can be. If the one rabbit was matted to the point where it was affecting being able to poop then it can\u2019t eat the cecotropes, which will then cause nutritional deficits and GI upset, which can easily kill a rabbit. I own a Lions head rabbit, which is much smaller and less fluffy than an angora, and I have to brush her every other day to avoid her coat matting. Angora rabbits should be brushed daily.", "I see your point.", "Absolutely my mother is going to have a gentle talk with them since she is on better terms with them than I am about what she noticed and why I took the actions necessary. I think there is some ignorance on their part because they have had animals before but I don\u2019t think they understood the gravity of how bad the Matt\u2019s were. She obviously brushed the top layer but the 2 inch layer of Matt underneath was severe. The lack of nail trimming really solidifies to me they never owned rabbits before. So I do think they will take advice well and won\u2019t be offended", "That was the biggest thing we\u2019re were worried about, the amount of poop in the cage was sorely lacking and we were terrified it was completely impacted. The brown one was more impacted then the white but white had the largest Matt.", "Shaving the rabbits is a much better option than an emergency vet bill would be. This was the right choice for this situation and you did the best you could."]}
