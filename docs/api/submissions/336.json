You work in a warehouse, you work a long shift, your sleep may be compromised, you've been sweating, you're wearing not cute clothes, etc. Sometimes it feels better to leave on the vest so everyone knows this isn't what you WANT to look like. \n\nI get why you want him to take it off, they're ugly as hell. But post-shift meals aren't really \"date night\" in his mind and it sounds like he feels insecure by his post-work look. Nobody looks BETTER after 10-12 hours in a warehouse. \n\nThe vest is like a disclaimer. I get why someone would want that because I've done it myself.", "YTA. I get why you don\u2019t like him wearing it, but his reasoning for wearing it is completely valid, and by asking him to take it off you probably made him a bit insecure about it. I think it would have been better and more productive to give him reassurance that he doesn\u2019t look like shit, rather than just say \u201cbut do you have to wear it out\u201d.\n\nNot to mention, instead of bringing it up in public, if it bothered you so many times you should have disclosed that with him at a different point in time, perhaps before you guys even went out anywhere. That way maybe you guys could figure out some compromise, like you both go home and change before you go out certain places that might call for better attire or something.", "YTA. Sounds like he\u2019s immediately going on dates with you right after work. If you want him to shower and change, give the man time to go home and get ready. \n\nIf you\u2019re embarrassed to be seen with a man in a vest it sounds like you really need to work on your priorities. \n\nLeave him alone and grow up.", "YTA\n\nYour boyfriend literally gets off work and instead of going home, getting a shower, and relaxing, he gets you and takes you out and now you complain because he keeps his work vest on hoping people won't judge his appearance so harshly? \n\nHow about you go do his job and see how much you care about a vest afterwards during \"a date\" AFTER work.", "YTA.  \n\nIt's interesting you can type out his reasonable reason but not \"understand\" it.  It's a simple act of empathy.  \n\nConsider letting him go home and change before going on your \"date\" if you don't want him to wear it.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all \"grab dinner after work\" is not a date. It's just dinner. Don't confuse that with a romantic date planned ahead, for which he would surely dress up.\n\nHe gave you a very good answer why he keeps the vest on. After work he looks like shit. With the vest on, everyone looking at him would know: *oh, he just got off work, he didn't get a chance to clean up*. Without the vest, maybe people would wonder why he walks in a restaurant smelling and looking like hell.\n\nYou're in the wrong. You owe him an apology.", "YTA \n\nYeah, I said it. You also need to get over yourself. You are embarrassed of him and what he does for a living. Any work is honest work and you're not above him with your jobs, and you still wouldn't be above him if you had a more prestigious job. \n\nLet him wear his armor. He will stop wearing it when he's ready.", "Slight YTA, it's OK to ask once, but if he declines, you should let it go.\n\nHe has a perfectly good reason for wearing it, not that he has to justify it.", "NAH. \"I'm embarrassed by the neon yellow eyesore you're wearing\" and \"I'm embarrassed by you/your job\" are not the same thing. It's perfectly reasonable to ask him not to walk around in it while you're out. However, it seems like there's some underlying anxiety for him about his appearance that you should approach with an open mind.", "NTA for asking once. But your next step is to ask him how you can help him feel a little bit cleaner after work. Would it help if you brought wet wipes, a comb, a new shirt? You guys are treating us as if it's you versus him instead of both of you versus the problem. You need to be acting like you're on his team and trying to help him figure out a solution if you want the vest to go away.", "YTA\n \n\n1. Kind of seems like you're ashamed of his job. I'm not saying you are it's how it comes off though. \n\n2. He's 100%right. There's a difference Between seeing an inexplicably dirty dude and seeing a dirty dude in a work vest.\n\n3. It's needlessly controlling and a form of micromanagement not cool or healthy", "YTA reverse that and see if it\u2019d sound right coming out of his mouth to you..", "YTA", "I think you're kind of TA. If you want him to dress nicely when you are out an about with him, maybe hint at and give hime time to freshen up before making plans to go out anywhere. I mean you can't control what someone else chooses to wear. If it's something that's offensive I would understand, but it's just a brightly colored vest. Stay in if you don't like it.", "NTA,  yet. Now that u know how he feels about it, is it really that important to u for him to take it off? He sees it as a shield against something he feels insecure about. If u bring it up again you will be an a**hole. When u love someone looks don't matter. It's just clothes.", "YTA. I think Homer Simpson got it right here when he says \"who cares?\".\n\nThis is a non-issue. Considering he just came out of work he probably just doesn't want to think about it. Let him.\n\nIf anyone is offended that your boyfriend is wearing a vest, kindly tell them to mind their own business. No one is really going to care what your boyfriend looks like so why should you?", "YTA", "[deleted]", "NTA. I do see where he\u2019s coming from about kind of wanting to signal he just got done with work. But I don\u2019t think he needs to keep on that neon vest while on a date in a restaurant. It\u2019s a bit odd.", "I think your speech was too harsh and sounded like judging him and his work.\n\nIf you sounded that way yeah YTA,\nBut if you explain yourself to him like, I don't know \"I like to cuddle you while shopping\" etc. in a thoughtful way, I am sure he will understand.\n\nYou didn't intent to judge so NTA...", "NAH - you aren't being rude or an AH when asking for  him to take off the neon vest. It's whole function is to draw attention and stand out.\n\nI do get your bf's reasoning, but maybe he's being a little too self-conscious about it.", "NTA\n\nIt seems weird because you would think he would want to take it off. I feel like if he really respected you, he would at least try to look decent for you. It\u2019s not even just that you\u2019re out, you see him in just that all the time. If it were me, I would be demanding a shower too. \n\nHe\u2019s kind of right about the vest maybe. A couple of years ago, I had a choice to give someone something for free right before Christmas. There was a white woman and a black man with that same yellow vest. He looked really tired. So I choose him. But that\u2019s an unusual situation", "NAH -\n\n there's no shame in what he does, and that's too bad he feels so crappy about himself after work.  It sounds like he's feeling overly self conscious. Honestly if he's feeling shty after work and thinking the vest is going to be some sort of 'hall pass' while sitting down to dinner? Nope that's just going to draw more attention to himself.  Restaurant patrons are not going to notice or care that the young man 2 tables over looks a little tired.  They will notice the vest - it's not likely going to be noticed in a horrified way but it does draw more attention to him than just wearing regular cloths.   It's one thing running errands after work / even grabbing some take out but if the work day is over and you're sitting down to eat: take off the vest.  Also if he's out shopping with you - he's likely to be mistaken for an employee .  Maybe if he kept a casual jacket or over-shirt in his car, that way he might feel a bit more put together after his long day.\n\nI don't think you're 'ashamed' of him, you'd like like him to to put a tiny amount of effort (taking off a vest) when you're out on the town. \n\nThere's a lot of jobs that have pieces of required clothing, I'd hope if he worked at a butcher shop (I bet they have tiring work days too) he'd take off the bloody apron before sitting down at Olive Garden.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We used to have a safety manager where I worked and everyone made front of him for wearing his safety vest in the office. All of the supervisors had them as well but they put them on at the jobsites. The office was 1 mile away from the closest jobsite and 40 miles from the furthest one. I'd be rolling my eyes at someone doing this because in my experience they did it to feel more important or like they were relevant to something. They weren't, they were just employees with different job descriptions.", "[deleted]", "Tell him to take off the bloody high vis, stop looking like an idiot for wearing a piece of safety equipment after work.

My job is an especially dirty one, before I landed a position there that required a very recognizable uniform I would emerge from my shift in old clothes looking pretty dirty.

So not too wild of an assumption. On another post else where on reddit, you said you feel self conscious because you've gained weight. I don't see how you can't get the fact that he is just trying to make himself feel better about his appearance with a simple fix of keeping a work vest on.\n\nAlso, my \"mean-ish\" delivery was merely being at a loss of understanding of how you could be so mean and show no empathy towards someone you have feelings for. So I guess you should be able to flip that thought of angry undertones and see how your harsh words towards his worker uniform made him feel.

Maybe just apologize if you hurt his feelings.  A simple sorry goes a long way ive learned. \n\nMaybe give him a compliment about how attractive he looks in his work clothes, give him the confidence he seems to need by wearing his vest by letting him know you think he looks nice instead of focusing on the vest.  \n\nI hope you have all the blessings in life and that you grow with love and empathy."]}
