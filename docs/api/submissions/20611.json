I looked at them and laughed they told me they were being serious and that I need to learn to be financially stable for when I\u2019m  older.

My parents told me I\u2019m selfish and to repay them for all the things they bought me as a kid. I asked them are they for real and they said yes. They said when they were my age they helped there parents with bills and they didn\u2019t have any money left for themselves. I told them as adult you shouldn\u2019t want that for your child and want to be different than there parents. They yet again called me selfish. Now let me tell you why I have to save up for college. My parents told me that they will not be responsible for my college funds and I will have to figure it out on my own. And that they will not be messing their credit score over me but for my brother. I was heart broken but now I\u2019m livid of how selfish they are but will help one child and not the other. So AITA in this situation?\n\n\nEdit: I have forgot to mention that I will pay a quarter of the rent but not half since I have to pay for my future and the rest of the stuff I need like clothes and shoes and other stuff that I want. Example a sewing machine.

If it were me I would be sure not to give them access to any money you earn - no accounts with their names, no cash in a place they could find it, they way you describe them I assume they would steal it.\n\nHonestly I wonder if demanding that you pay rent as a 15 year old is even lawful, is there someone else you could go live with?  These people obviously don't value you at all but rather see you as a burden they'd like to be rid of.

They legaly have to provide for you till your 18. (If you're in the US) they can't demand rent or anything from you till you're 18. Now yea, sometimes kids help the family out if on hard times. But your summer job money goes to things like your phone, car, insurance for car, clothing they choose to not buy you. Games and so on. Your parents can't demand you pay rent, food, or utilities. That's all required for them to provide you. NTA", "NTA. And you're not selfish either. You're 14 years old & shouldn't be expected to pay rent. I'm sorry your parents are behaving this way.

If you can afford to save up before you are 18 and want to emancipate and move out early definitely do that.  \n\nThey are the selfish ones, told you that you\u2019re suppose to have NOTHING. They aren\u2019t even paying for your college and you\u2019re suppose to figure it out, so that means you are absolutely not giving them rent money at all so you can to college. If they start to steal your money, I would get your legal documents (license, social security, and birth certificate) and move out to other families home or friends willing to let you in. If they refuse to give you these legal documents, your job will have a copy of them for work. This is beyond messed up and the fact they are saying they are going to do everything for your brother but not you is horrendous and horrible.

It you where not in school it would be a different story. Or if you where 18 and out HS", "NTA. Not at all. But I do have to ask, are your parents incredibly stressed about money? I mean, even if they are they\u2019re going about everything completely wrong but if their budget is super tight they may have hoped you could pitch in.

Are they tight on money?  If they need it, expecting you to contribute could be reasonable, but...\n\nRemind them that you may be choosing their care home.", "Need more info. Is there possibly a cultural issue here? I know there are cultures where it is fairly normal for any working family member to pitch in towards household bills, and people who grew up in those cultures often feel like this was a formative and important part of growing up for them and may even be grateful their parents taught them \"responsibility\" and \"family loyalty\" and \"the real value of work/money.\" In which case, it might feel very hurtful and confusing to be essentially told that the way their parents raised them is wrong or unreasonable or abusive. \n\nYou also didn't mention the reason your parents are willing to invest in education for your brother and not you. Again, I've run across this phenomenon in a few East Asian and immigrant families as a very pragmatic move in cultures that see the whole family as a single economic unit: everyone pitches in to invest in one family member on a career track to a lucrative, practical career---usually doctor, dentist, lawyer, etc., with the expectation that the invested-in child will then pull up and help other members of the family in the future. It's not easy being the \"other\" kid...but on the other hand, you'll likely have a lot less pressure and a lot more freedom as an adult than your brother. \n\nIf there's a legitimate cultural issue here, then it is possible that there are NAH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have an amazing head on your shoulders for planning this out now! My one piece of advice is to start saving but don\u2019t just save it in a bank look up ways that you can save, that will give you a higher interest yield! I forget what it is, but there is a minors version of some thing like a Roth IRA. Do it now, and do it slowly! It sounds like you\u2019re really smart kid."]}
