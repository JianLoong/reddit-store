Only child neglected here is op.", "Mums can be evil horrible people too. She abandoned her kid to live with her dad full time. She deserves literally nothing from OP.", "If this was a dad you wouldn\u2019t be saying that. People just don\u2019t ever want to accept that mums can be awful people too.", "OP is 16, and it's her half brother, born after OP's mother took off", "Ouch... That manipulation came through the screen...", "About as much as she did when she walked away from op.", "I read it that way too at first lol", "i figured you were young. who tf expects someone visiting another city to leave their child alone? this is a 2 year old. reddit may be immature enough to say NT A, but guess what? in the real world, YTA.", "[deleted]", "Oh, yes - great idea to slap a label on a two-year-old.", "American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines list 4 as the earliest age for diagnosis.", "Yeah because it's not like the 2yo has a dad that could look after him /s", "Yeah, it's not realistic to expect her to leave him. Where would she leave him? And how dare she do things like helping him eat! OP, you don't have to see your mom, but yes YTA for this expectation.", "Sounds like the mother basically abandoned OP for her new family, and is now upset that OP resents her for it.", "Mommy dearest divorced dad and then gave up custody to play house with her NEW husband and baby.....\n\nOP is justified in how they feel. How would you feel if your own parent did that to you?", "Ok so I know OP is ofc major NTA but it\u2019s quite a leap to call their half brother affair baby. It might be true but those things are not nearly as common as one is lead to believe by reading Reddit", "And OP, her minor child, lives with OP's father full time. The two year old will be fine with his dad, who OPs mom lives with, for a day.", "Maybe the father wasn't there in the city.  All I can get is that OP seems to hate their mother as only a person who hates their mother would do that.    I really think this has more to do with bad blood b/w them than the 2 year old.  If there were not I think most people, even at 16,  would have compromised.  Perhaps said No to dinner but yes to grabbing a small bite.", "She could always leave the child with his father, her husband given that she had no issue leaving OP in their fathers custody and moving to another city to marry him.", "She could leave him with his dad.", "That\u2019s not in the post. I asked because without that information it didn\u2019t make sense.", "Man, what did mom do that made a 16 year old refer to their brother as \"my mom's child\" not \"my half sibling\" doesn't even state it as a fact. That's a big distance to put between yourself and your brother. There are people on here that describe how their mother or father horribly cheated and their spouse and abandoned their family, where a love child legit broke up their family and they STILL call the other children their siblings.\n\nThis isn't a judgment on OP, I'm genuinely curious as to what happened because it must have been bad.", "Possibly because they have no relationship with the mother seeing as they live in a different town and just from the general gist you get from the OP.  It may have been like this for a few years.  The mom has a 2 year old who is essentially a stranger to the OP.  The have not been brought up as siblings.  The kid really is their mom's child... even if they share some genetics."]}
