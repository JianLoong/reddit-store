Because of him and my mom I was able to live in a house rent free for all of that time. Because of his parents who left him an inheritance I have had decades of support financially when life hit hard. Yes, my mom also has worked the same and sometimes more than him all of that time, but he took care of me alongside her. He NEVER had to do that. I never expected it of him or assumed. Especially as an adult. As a mom myself of a child who is now older than I was when he married my mom- I still don\u2019t expect anything from him.

Sure, life happens, relationships change, but using that as an excuse to shortchange the stepdaughters is, well, pretty asshole-ish.\r  \n\r  \nIn conclusion, yeah, you might be the asshole in this scenario.

Hope you feel more relief and less guilt as you read some of these comments. Wish you the best!", "So you\u2019ve lived by your neighbors kids how many years.. so guess you need to deposit money into their account as well.. \n\nit\u2019s ludicrous to expect you to continue paying for kids that aren\u2019t yours and their own parents didn\u2019t.. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "Your ex wife is irresponsible. It\u2019s her responsibility alone.", "NTA but why did you even entertain your ex wife when she started yapping? you have zero responsibility to her or her daughters. by the time y\u2019all divorced, they were what 9 or 10? you weren\u2019t even there when they started maturing and those hardships so i\u2019m not sure why any of those 3 feel entitled to money but they obv take after mom since she\u2019s a user. \n\npersonally, i just would\u2019ve hung up the phone the minute your ex started in. no reason to talk.. you have zero connection to her or her family that she\u2019s ruining.", "Nta you have no responsibility to the ex stepchildren you've had no communication with them.for year now they demand money say it was there mother and bilogicalnfather responsibly to pay for them not you and that they should thank you for the money they receive from you", "Lol absolutely NTA", "Nta", "NTA, it was generous of you to pay into the accounts of the two daughters your ex wife had prior to your marriage.  After the marriage ended, in my view your responsibility ended at that time as well. \n\nAnd your family who feel that you should have continued to pay in for them are more than welcome to assist the two daughters with college funding.", "NTA, legally you could have taken all the money as it was yours.", "Listen to the friends. Nta", "How would the stepdaughters even know how much was in ur bio daughters accounts to even compare??", "NTA. Also, I would take that money and enjoy a nice vacation with your daughter or something with it that you have wanted to do with your daughter.\n\nIt's not your problem that the twins mother cheated and that both of their parents never considered their futures. It's your money to do with as you see fit.", "NTA. Sounds like they weren\u2019t actually your daughters after the divorce. Did you see them or contact the regularly or have shared custody? \u2026 dunno - sounds like you\u2019re NTA \u2026 but how close were you with them \u2026", "NTA\n\nYou're not important enough to them for them to keep in regular contact with you, but they should be important enough to you that you should give them tens of thousands of dollars? Nah.", "NTA. If you didn\u2019t have to pay child support you didn\u2019t have to continue giving them money you gave them because you were married to their mom.", "No you aren\u2019t the a-hole", "INFO.   You were their main father figure from age 2 to 9.   After you split up, did you continue your relationship with them?", "They have two biological parents who paid nothing into the accounts but OP is the one people are coming to for money?", "I\u2019m apparently meaner than all of you after reading the comments\u2026I would have closed the twins accounts, maybe rolling them over into my daughter\u2019s. They should have no expectation of receiving money from mom\u2019s ex-husband since mom never contributed a penny. \n\nI understand the kids didn\u2019t do anything but OP didn\u2019t pay child support, did he? They should be grateful they are getting ANY MONEY at all. They are getting a bonus not a punishment!", "I agree they should be happy with whatever they get. The entitlement must come from the mother. Free money is free money; they should use it for school. They are ahead of the game and earn enough one day to buy their homes. Any amount given to these girls is a blessing. Unless it was stated in the divorce agreement that you continue these deposits, your obligation ended when the divorce was finalized.", "I would have taken the money once divorced honestly lol", "At the time of the divorce, my life was not how I planned it. I was not concerned with the gift I had given them. If their mother had changed the address, it wouldn't have bothered me a bit. I never tried to change the address on the account.", "This page does not allow us to insult or name call other. But I will say drugs, drunk or prison. I never kept track of him beyond knowing he could not hold a job with both hands covered in glue.", "I did not keep track of her number. It took me a good minute to figure out who was screeching at me. In that time she had more than enough to chew my ass.", "It still required her signature to remove. No way in hell was I going to try and contact her for that.", "My daughter was quite vocal about buying the house when she did. I never saw the actual messages or heard the conversation, but I assume they put 2 and 2 together.", "They were only married for 5 years too!", "Nope, I thought the exact same. Just reading the comments now. I think OP should take his daughter on a vacation or do something they have always wanted to do together. \n\nHonestly they sound like their mom. All about money.", "Yes! Me too!", "The step sisters knew because they saw OP\u2019s daughter buy a house with her bank account.", "Thank you, that makes sense. I was confused too.", "it\u2019s appalling to me that you are expected to finance children that don\u2019t belong to you in any way shape or form . They have a dad . and a mom. presumably. not your circus. not your monkeys . not your responsibility", "And as another poster said months ago that I have to steal but OP sure knows the clowns!", "PSA: Be careful with that saying if you're white.", "Or, \"Not my Starship, not my Redshirts \"", "NTA OP, and I like your dad, what he said times infinity!!!", "Also Money from an ex-stepdad that exists because he was at some point their Dad and expecting to Always be their Dad, but Not any more and hasnt for years, is Kind of the best place unexpected Money (of any amount but especially a significant-but-not-quite-life-altering amount that can buy a nice bicycle or a decent Computer or a Modest vacation or a very crappy used Car) could come from. If it was from an ACTUAL Stranger, the'd worry about Strings attached, and If it was from someone who owed them an ACTUAL commitment, Like their Mom or grandparent or bio-dad or current-stepdad, they'd wonder why they hadn't told them before.", "Right, and if she didn't want them to maintain a relationship, then she doesn't get to complain about the direct effects of them not having a relationship.", "Because they saw her buy a house with it!", "They were looking very closely to see that level of detail.", "I ABSOLUTELY have to remember this for work!!!  \n\nGive that kiddo a high five from this internet stranger (provided you don't think it's inappropriate).\n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Yeah but if you haven't had anything to do with someone since you were 9 yrs old and you are now college age. That's not much difference then strangers."]}
