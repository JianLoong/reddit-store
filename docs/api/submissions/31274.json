Your ex wife doesn\u2019t seem care enough, not putting money into her biological children\u2019s account meanwhile someone not their biological father is supporting them. Not your issue you did what their biological parents should have done. The nerve of all of them and who agree with them.", "NTA - The ex needs to look in the mirror. Your intentional and considerate deposit for 5 years resulted in $1,000's of dollars for her daughters....yet it turned into a blaming game? No gratitude was said. The cheating Ex is loud to deflect attention away from the truth: She never contributed $ while married or divorced from you. She never cared about this goal. Facts are facts.\n\nYou don't need to apologize or rectify this outcome. These daughters were in your life for 5 years then no effort was made to stay connected; a common outcome when your wife chooses infidelity. Fact is fact.\n\nEnjoy your life and when you're sitting in your daughter's new house take a moment and know you did well. You gave her the means to stabilize her present and future. Great Job, Dad. Great job.", "NTA - Your ex has sone nerve, and her daughter being mad at you says a lot about them too.", "Nta. Whilst I think that step parents should treat their stepkids like their own while you're married, that obligation doesn't continue after a divorce.  If you had stayed close it would have been a nice thing to do but there's no obligation.  Their mother is ridiculously entitled to think you would have continued to do so and obviously didn't care enough to even find out what was going on.  Good on you for starting them in the first place, particularly as their mother never contributed.", "NTA. Their mother (and father, if theirs is around)  should have been funding their savings accounts. \n\nSure, it\u2019s not your stepdaughters\u2019 fault for the divorce, but their mother made a decision to cheat.  Unfortunately one of the consequences of that is their mother needing to take financial accountability for her own children, not you.", "Y\u2019all had almost no contact with each other, and yet they feel they have the right to call you up and bitch about how there should be more money in an account that you started for them out of the goodness of your heart that they themselves didn\u2019t even know existed until recently. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d even consider yourself an AH!", "NTA\n\nThey are not your children and not your responsibility. It was generous of you to put money away for them when you was with their mother, you didn't have to do that. Why would you keep paying in after their Mother betrayed you with another man.\n\nTell them they are lucky they have anything from you and cut all ties.", "NTA\u2026.first off there are not your bio children. Secondly, if there much never much of a relationship between you all then they have no basis for claiming support from you.", "NTA.  They weren't a part of your life, so why should you fund it?", "NTA\n\n> My ex-wife contacted me and chewed my ass because I had not paid into those accounts\n\nI'd have hung up on her.  She could have contributed.  She didn't.  They think of you as their piggy-bank, handing out money.  \n\nIt's good to be ex", "NTA. You should have immediately changed the mailing address on the accounts when you were divorced, though. By keeping it your address you kept involved and preventing them from receiving updates on their account balance.", "NTA. Not your biological daughters. Where was the twin\u2019s biological dad\u2019s monetary support?", "NTA  Your ex chose to damage the marriage knowing it would damage the relationship between her daughters and yourself. You had no obligation to start the account in the first place. You did it out of the kindness of your heart, the heart your ex chose to break. Therefore their future was no longer your responsibility it was their mother's.", "NTA they should be grateful for what they got.", "NTA\n\nWhat's with people always saying step kids are your kids? Let alone ex step kids?\n\nKids who are biologically yours are yours regardless of what you want or think of them.\n\nKids who are NOT biologically yours can only be considered yours if YOU WANT to consider them as such.\n\nYou don't owe a step kid anything but a respectful relationship and providing for there essentials, anything else is optional, and if you don't choose step up, then it's there parent's job, not yours.\n\nThe AUDACITY!!", "Yta to yourself. How weak willed are you that you could allow anyone to convince you that you have done anything wrong at all in this situation?", "So you were in those kids' lives from when they were 2.5 until they were about 9? They called you dad? What happened after you split from their mom? \n\nI don't see how you can help raise kids and then just dump them, but I can't imagine going through the whole cheating thing either. \n\nEverything hinges on your relationship with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And if their mother didn't care enough to put money into their accoutns, why should you...a literal stranger.  \n\n\nyour other friends are right. a little money is better than none at all.", "NTA\n\nYou were in their life for all of 6ish years, and the mother paid NOTHING into these accounts, if she wanted money for them, that was HER job, not yours.\n\nSheesh.  she sounds like a grifter honestly.", "NTA they are not your daughters you were in there lives for a good amount of time and in that time you saved money for them. They would have zero had you not made these accounts and put money in.", "**NTA**   The only reason they have anything is because you contributed to their future when their mom was with you.

You barely had any contact with the girls. They're not your responsibility, and it seems their mother didn't put any effort into keeping the girls and you in contact. She didn't contribute to her daughters' accounts that you made for them, not before and not after the divorce. It's like you two didn't even have a discussion or an agreement after the divorce concerning the accounts. I can't blame the girls too much for feeling it's unfair because, most likely, that's their mother's words.", "NTA, they had little to do with you after the split, if they'd stayed close and visited, called whatever then maybe you'd be the AH.", "NTA", "NTA My only response would have been to ask \"How much have YOU deposited into the accounts for YOUR daughters???\n\nThey all seem pretty entitled, especially since her daughters didn't appear to keep in touch with you after the divorce. Now, all of a sudden, they've become adults and they have their hands out.", "NTA\n\n1. Your relationship with the step-daughters ended with the end of your marriage; any whiff of moral obligation to fund them ended then, too.\n2. Your daughter's account was equally funded by you and your wife and additionally funded by other relatives (/friends?). You are the only person who ever paid into step-daughters' accounts (other than bank interest).\n3. Your former step-daughters are lucky to have the unexpected bonus of the funds that you saved for them and didn't even consider taking back, given how their mom was cheating on you.\n4. You can tell \"some of your family members\" that you did not punish them for their mom's sins; that you did want and give what was best for them - more so than their mother did, and then ask those same family members if they continued giving gifts to your former step-daughters after the divorce.\n5. So how do these former step-daughters, who are not in your life and didn't even know they had savings accounts,... how do they know how much money your daughter's account had? Sounds to me like there are some people in your life (besides ex-wife and her step-daughters) who look at you as a piggy-bank.", "NTA \n\nSeems like several people could use a remedial lesson on the Golden Rule. \n\nThe People With The Gold Make The Rules. \n\nThey're not your kids. \n\nYou don't owe them jack squat.", "NTA I think if you had shared custody of them, you should have continued putting money in their accounts. If you didn't see them much then no.", "NTA.", "Ask why their mother never put a single dime into the account? Tell them while there may only be a few thousand in there you were the only one contributing towards it so it would never have matched your daughters amount. If their mother hadn\u2019t been cheating there\u2019d have been a lot more in there so she is fully responsible and has everything to answer for.", "NTA. The ex and step daughters have a weird way of saying thank you for saving thousands on our behalf even though we cheated on you, aren\u2019t yours biologically, and didn\u2019t see or speak to you often for years. They should be grateful they have anything at all from you because you don\u2019t owe them a dime. Close the accounts and take a vacation haha", "Mostly not TA, but you have had years to get the address on the account sorted between you, as adults. If your ex had been getting the statements she would have been better informed. Did you ever mention it to her in the intervening years?", "NTA\n\nAlso if I'm not mistaken Opie did say that he was not in contact with the said stepdaughters for years so it almost seems like they're strangers and Opie does it's not responsible for said strangers", "\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^ THIS!!!  Oh, so much THIS!\n\nYou are NTA and should have ***never*** even considered the possibility.", "It is doubtful that the bank would allow him to change the address for his ex.  That was her responsibility.", "Agreed!! This reminds me of something my dad used to say when people tried to involve him in conflicts that had nothing to do with him\u2026not my circus, not my monkeys! NTA!", "Love that phrase!!"]}
