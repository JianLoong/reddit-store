I honestly do believe that some pictures that I have seen are so beautiful of two women in wedding dresses however I have seen some where I am just not a fan.

The conversation moved on and it was never really discussed again. \n\nFast forward to a year or so later and we are now engaged. After we got engaged, the parents of my Fiance were disappointed to know she was not going to be wearing a dress however my Fiance, without any thoughts from me, told her parents that she was going to be wearing something else and that was that. A dress just wasn't an option for her. \n\nFast forward to 2 months of being engaged when my Fiance calls me and tells me that she went outfit shopping with a friend today for the wedding and started trying on dresses and actually found one that she loves. I was livid and angry and frustrated and just sad. I got really angry with her and told her she could not wear a dress. I didn't want that to be my reaction for her but it was and I honestly hate that it was. \n\nI know I am marrying a freaking women. I do NOT have a problem with that. And I know that it's me being selfish because honestly I wanted to be the only one in a wedding dress that day and I thought that was something we already decided on. I get I am marrying the person and should love them no matter what they are wearing and that that is the most important thing but this is something that I just can't get over. I also understand that this is her wedding day too but like we discussed this!!! How can she just change her mind? \n\nAt the end of the day if she REALLY wants this how can I say no but a part of me will just be a bit pissed that she went back on what she said she was going to do.

I would dig a little deeper and think about why this dress thing matters to you do much. From your post, you say you want to be the only one in a dress, and you don\u2019t want your fianc\u00e9 to also feel and look her most beautiful. I\u2026.. I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t want her to wear something she loved. It\u2019s not just YOUR day, it\u2019s HER day too.", "YTA. You're being a bridezilla to your bride!", "YTA. Stop being a bridezilla and be happy you\u2019re marrying a wonderful woman in the clothes of her choice. Just like she\u2019s going to do.", "YTA and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready for marriage.

You're treating her like a prop in her own wedding...", "YTA. Of course she can just change her mind about what *she* is going to wear! She's the only one who should have a say in what she wears. You should never have coerced that promise from her in the first place. \n\nNow apologize to your bride and settle down. You are taking the tiny details of this wedding far too seriously! A wedding isn't really important -- it's the *marriage* that's important; the one this wedding is designed to begin and to celebrate. \n\nWhen I was planning my first wedding, I decided up front that I would be happy once it was all over so long as 1) I ended up married to the person I wanted to marry, and 2) everybody was still speaking to everyone else by the time it was over. I recommend you take up a similar philosophical approach. The rest really doesn't matter.", "YTA\n\nShe probably wasn\u2019t planning on wearing a dress and accidentally found one she liked.

You need to evaluate that - you should view your wedding photos and think \u201coh my, we both look happy and stunning\u201d not \u201cwell I\u2019m not the only one in a dress\u201d.", "#YTA. \n\nAre you sure marriage is the right thing for y\u2019all right now?", "YTA...you said you had seen some pictures where you liked the two dress aesthetic.

People change their minds.", "YTA\n\nYou need to talk to a therapist or something. The fact that you can't get over this, when it's really clear that not only is your fiance entitled to decide what she wears on HER wedding day, but that you need to feel like the center of attention and \"more special\" than her... It's really not okay. You need to figure this out, and you shouldn't marry until you do. This is about more than a dress.", "YTA - And I question your emotional stability if her saying she was trying on dresses and found one she likes made you \"livid\". I also question how real this is since women tend to know the difference between \"women\" (plural) and \"woman\" (singular). You're marrying a woman, not a \"women\", and this woman you're marrying apparently wishes to wear a dress too. She is allowed to change her mind. Things change over time. Your reaction is immature and pure assholery.\n\nI want to add that my ex-wife and I got married wearing matching rainbow sundresses in a court room of a neighboring state that had just legalized same-sex marriage about a month earlier. Most places it was still illegal. Be happy you can marry her at all. We are entering very dark times that may see this ability taken from us. You are supposed to be marrying the person you love. You're not marrying the outfits you wear, the venue, or anything else. Someday, maybe not long from now if you keep your present attitude, you will find yourself in a different place, getting this marriage dissolved because you find yourselves no longer compatible with each other. Enjoy this time while you can.", "YTA\n\nIf you really want pics where you are the only one in a dress maybe the two of you could have a post wedding photo shoot where you take turns being the one in the dress and the one in the suit - but both of you would have to be the one in the suit for some of the pics.", "YTA. As you already pointed out, it's Her day too. You're being selfish and immature. I can't figure out why, if you love this girl so much, you want to put her in something she isn't excited to wear on her wedding day. I'd want to show off my new wife as much as possible. But you seem more interested in generating all the attention for yourself.", "YTA.

If you can\u2019t get over this small thing you are going to lose her and rightfully so.", "YTA\nWhy does she have any less right to wear a dress than you?", "YTA - Both of you should wear whatever makes you feel beautiful, even if that means that you both wear dresses. It wont take anything away from you. Spend your time planning and stressing over how to create a beautiful marriage rather than worrying about the wedding. The day will fly by so quickly while your marriage should last the rest of your life.", "YTA.\n\nHow can you not know that YTA?\n\nI could literally cry for your poor fiance.", "YTA - she changed her mind. People can do that and it\u2019s not like she said she didn\u2019t want children and started picking out baby names. It\u2019s a dress. A freaking dress. Grow up.", "YTA. It\u2019s her wedding just as much as yours. If you don\u2019t understand that fundamental truth you aren\u2019t ready to be married.", "YTA. You sound narcissistic and exhausting.", "YTA - if only one bride can wear a dress in your perfect photos, it's time to go shopping for a suit.", "Sounds like you already know the answer to this question", "YTA and I hope your fianc\u00e9e sees this and decides not to marry you", "yes", "Yes, you are selfish. You should should be thrilled she found a dress she likes. You should be happy to see her in it on your wedding day. Yes, you are the AH.", "YTA. Telling her you wanted that moment for you in the dress, without really discussing it, she probably felt like she had to agree, plus people are allowed to change their minds. I don't understand why you both can't be in dresses, as you said you both deserve to wear what you want. If you feel so strongly about it, you can choose to wear something else.", "You wrote it all out. You know this feeling isn't coming from a place of rationality or justice. So find a way to work through it so that your love for your fiancee wins out.", "YTA.  She wanted to wear a dress from the start, but you strong armed her into agreeing to something else.  All she wants now is the same thing you do, to wear a wedding dress. If your wedding is more important than your marriage, you should both give more thought to whether you\u2019re ready for marriage.", "She's a woman.  It's her prerogative to change her mind.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You\u2019re definitely allowed to have some time to be mad- emotions aren\u2019t rational, and sometimes, one can\u2019t help but to feel what they feel. Take your moment (alone!!!) to seethe. That\u2019s fine!  Then take a deep breath, remind yourself that you\u2019re not the only bride at your wedding, put on your big girl dress, and be thrilled that your fianc\u00e9e found something that makes her, too, feel beautiful on your joint wedding day.  If you marry the human you love, you\u2019ve just had a perfect wedding. Everything else is just set dressing.", "If I were marrying you, I\u2019d show up in an inflatable T Rex costume for spite.\n\nYTA", "YTA and seem pretty self  centered. She\u2019s allowed to change her mind over time. Her happiness should be just as important as yours, but you seem more concerned with being the center of attention.", "YTA and you need to take a long hard look at what you\u2019re doing and decide whether you actually want a marriage or whether you just want your fantasy wedding.", "YTA! Stop being a bully and a bridezilla! She doesn't dictate what you wear. Leave her alone! It's her Wedding as well NOT JUST YOURS!!!!! You are so selfish.", "YTA and you know full well YTA. I'm not sure why you even posted.", "You sound entitled, spoiled, and narcissistic. \"But I am the pretty one, I must be the only one to feel beautiful and special on MY special day\"\n\nGet over yourself. She has the right to change her mind. She probably only agreed with you in the first place to get you to stop talking about yourself.  It's as much her day as it is yours. She deserves to feel special and have the spotlight on her as well.\n\nYou are getting married,  it will never only be about you ever again. You are a team. You need to start acting like it and not as the star player. \n\nGood luck, OP. YTA", "YTA.

Do you think you and only you should be the center of attention?\n\nEdit: I also love how you\u2019re so shocked and horrified that your fianc\u00e9e\u2014gasp!\u2014changed her mind. It reminds me of this amy Schumer sketch where a high school football team kept trying to find reasons why they should be allowed to r*pe and while trying to find a loophole that would allow them to do it, one of them said, \u201cwhat if she said yes at first but then changes her mind\u2014like a crazy person!?!?\u201d", "YTA. I think that you may be suffering from some internalised homophobia personally. It can be a really difficult thing to come to terms with being gay especially when you've grown up in a world that teaches you to expect straightness. \n\nThinking about marriage/weddings was a particularly hard spot for my girlfriend and I when we first got together too. Most people imagine their wedding days their whole lives and presumably you always pictured your white dress moment. It can be hard to now have to share that. \n\nHowever, you are also trying to force that moment away from your partner as well. Sure she originally said she would be happy in a jumpsuit or suit, which she probably still would be. But she found a dress that makes her feel happy and beautiful, why do you not want her to feel that at your wedding? Besides weddings and marriage is about joining your lives together not about what someone does or doesn't wear. I worry that this is just the first sign in much bigger issues to come in marriage.\n\nIf it is a case of internalised homophobia, that is not your fault and does not make you an asshole.

How could you think you weren't? I'd be surprised if she didn't have doubts about marrying you after that reaction. Weddings and funerals really bring out the worst in people. (OP, you're \"people.\")\n\nYou sound controlling and incredibly selfish. You have her an order. What will happen if she doesn't listen to you? You'll have an attitude the whole day? You'll give her the silent treatment? You'll be emotionally abusive? Get over yourself. It seems like you let heteronormative ideas infiltrate your relationship. Talk to a therapist.", "YTA and wtf dude? As a woman who has also married a woman, I can tell you that as the less effeminate of the two of us, if my slightly more femme partner had demanded that I wear something that wasn't a wedding dress at my own dang wedding, there may not have been one. I started out wanting to wear something suit-like. But I too found a dress I loved and even though my partner and I have had all kinds of issues over the years,  not one damn time has she tried to TELL ME WHAT I AM ALLOWED TO WEAR.", "YTA she\u2019s allowed to change her mind when she actually goes out and experiences what outfits are available for her. A lot of women change their mind about the style of dress they want once they actually try them on, how is this much different. \n\n\nDon\u2019t you want your new wife to feel as beautiful and special as you do on the wedding day? You\u2019re picking aesthetics and photos over your fianc\u00e9 feeling beautiful too.

A lot of this post is about what you envision, but what does she envision? You\u2019re being selfish.\n\nEdit to add: if you do decide this is your hill to die on, these photos that are your perfect aesthetic will cause resentment for her because she will forever remember having to dull her sparkle, not wear the dress she loved because you needed to be the only special one in a wedding dress. \n\nCompromise comes up a lot in marriage, you really want to start the marriage showing you\u2019re incapable of that when it comes to making your wife feel beautiful, confident and special?", "ME ME ME LOOK AT ME ME ME. \nYTA.", "This is her wedding as much as it is yours.\n\nYTA.", "Single wedding should be a thing.

Maybe you guys can go with different styles of wedding dress so that you still feel like an individual in the style, but she can still wear a dress she likes.

The expectation is that a 'good relationship' means it romantic all the time, no one ever disagrees and everything is perfect all the time and loves every single thing about their partner.

It's not a good relationship because OP wonders and literally asks how her fiance, an autonomous adult human being, could change her mind about wearing a dress on her wedding day. It's not a good relationship because OP doesn't at all mention how her fiance feels about all of this, only that she \"agreed\"\n\nIt sounds more like she was badgered into agreeing, and is now speaking up for herself.

I just don't like making bad faith assumptions based on one post.\n\nI agree that she's the asshole. She is 100% the asshole, but there's not enough info in the post to make an assessment of the entire relationship. Maybe she is controlling. Maybe not. I don't have the whole picture.  I don't know enough about the situation to assess her whole personality and make that decision, or tell someone to end a relationship.\n\nI am deeply touched that your assumptions about me on my one post caused you worry. You must be a truly gifted empath to know so much based on so little info about me.", "You must be single."]}
