When he was born, he had a head full of copper-red hair. He had the cutest little baby curls and I wanted to keep his hair long for as long as I could manage it. I\u2019d planned on cutting his hair after his first birthday. \n\nWhen my son was 10 months old, my mom cut my son\u2019s hair without my permission. She didn\u2019t contact me, never asked my opinion, nothing. She and my dad were keeping him for me at the time, and I found out she cut his hair when I went to pick him up. I was LIVID. I wanted to be there for my little boy\u2019s first haircut, and I didn\u2019t want it to be so early. I wanted him to grow his curls because I thought he was so adorable and handsome with his brand new penny copper hair. They both told me I was being irrational when I blew up over it. I asked them then not to ever cut his hair without consulting me first. \n\nMonths later, we started going to a stylist for his haircuts that I really like. She\u2019s great with him, he loves getting his hair cut by her, and it\u2019s a nice outing for us as mother/son or a family if his dad comes. It\u2019s something I enjoy, and something he enjoys. Apparently, my mother doesn\u2019t like the way this girl cuts my son\u2019s hair because she cut his hair AGAIN on a visit, without consulting me, and gapped up and ruined his cute little boy hair cut. Again, I asked her not to cut his hair without running it by me first. \n\nA month ago, my son stayed with my parents for two nights because I worked a late shift and my husband was gone for work. The second night, after my shift, my mother sent me a picture of his \u201cnew\u201d haircut that she, once again, did herself. I was seeing red. I\u2019d asked her twice now not to cut his hair without my knowledge. Her reasoning this time was \u201cAt least I sent you a picture of it.\u201d\n\nWhen I picked my son up, I went off. I told both of them that under no circumstances were they allowed to alter his appearance in any way, haircuts included. I told them I\u2019d already asked twice that they not, and they went against me as a mother, so this time I\u2019m not asking. I told both of  them explicitly if his hair was cut ever again while under their care, they will not have access to my son in any way other than supervised visits on my time. No more overnights, no more day visits without myself or my partner present. \n\nThey were not very happy about this. They told me I was looking for any reason to keep my son away from them. They told me I was being irrational over nothing. They went as far as telling me it was borderline abuse to let my son\u2019s hair grow over his eyes. At that point, I left, and I\u2019ve been LC and no visits since. \n\nI know my son needs grandparents, and I want him to have a healthy relationship with them, but I\u2019m tired of my wishes as a mother going unheard. \n\nAITA for threatening their relationship over this?", "created_utc": 1672313435, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy37oq/aita_for_threatening_my_parents_time_with_my_son/", "score": 238, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They aren't good grandparents and are stressing you to the max.", "NTA They've told and showed you that they're not going to respect you as a parent. They can't be trusted to watch your son. Any damage to their relationship with their grandchild is their own doing. It takes very little effort not to give this child a haircut\n\nHe's getting more haircuts than any other toddler on the planet at this point. Completely unnecessary on their part and they have to be doing it just to get you mad", "NTA - This is the only way to make it stop. Make sure you follow through with a healthy dose of consequence. At least a month for each offense wouldn't be unreasonable.  In the future, start as you intend to continue. Lay down the rules and consequences, since you are now having to play hardball. When they deliberately defy you, enact the punishment, doubling each time. So they've earned a 6 month timeout, and next time, it will be a year. I did this once, a two year timeout. Never had another problem.", "NTA, you were explicit about not cutting his hair and they continued to do it. Which seems an odd hill for them to die on, but I guess that's their choice. \n\nI have an acquaintance who did a similar thing with the grandchild (despite her daughter asking her not to repeatedly) and then would brag 'she can't tell me what to do' and this makes me think of her.", "NTA\nsounds like you have been very clear about your expectations and they're not respecting that. Tough situation but keep in mind that if they aren't respectful now who us to say they'll ever be respectful? Also start keeping a paper trail....They're saying that his long hair is neglectful on your part and that's an odd accusation.\n\nA healthy relationship can have boundaries. Looks like you'll need to find an overnight sitter for a bit.", "NTA. Your issue here is you let this happen 3 times before you exploded, I would have exploded the first time and went LC until I received an actual apology.\n\nThey are not the parents, you are.

They sure are though.  That would be the end of the relationship in my book.  I don\u2019t care if we are related.   You disrespect me and my boundaries/my child and I have every right to go NC.  Being family does not entitle people to be a**holes and treat you like a doormat.  I think you are absolutely in the right OP.", "NTA - You've asked them multiple times not to cut his hair and they continue to do so without your permission. You're well within your rights to set boundaries on what they can and cannot do while your son is in their care.", "NTA. If they won't accept your (perfectly reasonable) boundaries about this, then I'd be worried about what other boundaries they will boldly break. This is a power move - a weird one, but it's odd that anyone cares that much about someone else's hair - and is completely and blatantly disrespectful towards you. You told them not to, they keep doing it anyway. I wouldn't have let them watch my child after the first time, and certainly not after the second.", "NTA\n\nIt's kind of irrelevant what the thing that they did is, ie the haircut. The fact is that you asked them not to do it twice and they went ahead and ignored you.

They show no interest in your parental choices, and think it\u2019s fine to dismiss your authority. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no other way to teach them how wrong they are than by flexing that authority. Show them you\u2019re willing to do so, and perhaps they\u2019ll start to respect your authority.

They\u2019re being AHs by ignoring the boundary, by insisting it\u2019s a ridiculous boundary, and by telling you your enforcement of the boundary is the real problem.\n\n\u201cThey told me it was borderline abuse to let my son\u2019s hair grow over his eyes.\u201d PUH-LEASE.", "NTA. It feels like they\u2019re punishing you because you dared to set a boundary - at this point, your kid\u2019s hair just happens to be the object of the boundary stomping.", "NTA\n\nThe first time it happened it could have been forgivable if it hadn't happened twice more. Now, they're knowingly going against your wishes. \n\nYour stipulations for supervised visits should happen sooner, in my opinion.

It\u2019s not even about the haircuts, it\u2019s about trust. \n\nI get my kids\u2019 hair cut at Fantastic Sam\u2019s sometimes, so I\u2019m  not someone who cares a lot about haircuts. But if either set of grandparents violated my explicit instructions as yours have done THREE times over ANY issue, where I\u2019d made it clear this was something important to me and there was no room ambiguity, I\u2019d be cutting them off or threatening to cut them off from unsupervised time as well. \n\nIf they can\u2019t follow basic instructions on little (or not so little) stuff, I\u2019d have a hard time trusting them to follow my instructions on any future issue. What if a medical issue came up, and I couldn\u2019t trust them? And I wouldn\u2019t trust that they\u2019d let me take the lead on some of the big conversations you have as a parent (not sure what your parents are like, but would they impose religious beliefs on your kid you don\u2019t subscribe to? Would they follow your guidance on how you plan to talk to your kid about topics such as strangers, privacy, etc?)\n\nI think you can give them an opportunity to earn back your trust, but their inability to even recognize that they have violated it is concerning. \n\nAnyhow, you weren\u2019t threatening their relationship originally, because you allowed for the possibility of visits, as long as you were present. You weren\u2019t trying to keep your son away from them, just saying they couldn\u2019t have him unsupervised.

The time to react would have been the first time it happened.   The second time?  You should have never brought him there again.  I'm honestly confused as to why you keep bringing him there.  Are you depending on them for childcare?", "ESH.\n\nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I don't understand how it happened for a 3rd time.\n\nYour parents should have lost unsupervised visits the first time they cut your kid's hair.", "NTA but don't go overboard here maybe stop bringing him around for a while but don't completely cut them off just yet.

If they think they know what\u2019s best, and what you say hardly matters, then they\u2019ll also think they know what\u2019s best when your kid says \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t touch me\u201d or whatever.", "yup, time to unlearn it.  Your parents are not good or safe people and they absolutely cannot be responsible for your child.", "Yeah, but you're family to them, and they're treating you like shit.", "Supervised visits only. Don't trust them alone with him until he's well old enough to talk and stand up for himself.", "How long we talking?", "I feel for you. My mom was the exact way when I had kids. She had a way of making me think I was over reacting or being unreasonable. So believe me when I tell you I know what your going through. My mom even went as far as threaten me with grandparents rights because she believed I was to do everything she said to do and she was in charge. \n\nSo my first advice is to find a therapist. They will help you learn first your not the bad guy and that it\u2019s ok to set boundaries. \n\nAnd it will also help to have someone neutral to vent to. My guess is as your son gets older you are really going to realize how toxic your relationship with your parents is. Which is something else very hard to deal with on your own. \n\n\nBut know you are not doing anything wrong. What they did was assault. They did not have permission or legal authority to cut your sons hair. So let that sink in. He is your son.", "Then you don\u2019t get to complain, your parents are doing you a solid by watching your son, and I\u2019m betting they\u2019re doing it for free. You\u2019re complaining about a hair cut. A haircut. They\u2019re taking care of your child, is he dirty? Mistreated? Underfed? If the answer is no, then if you don\u2019t like how they watch him (for free) then pay someone to stay with him.", "You have told them time and time again and they do not listen. This isn't just about firsts but how they don't listen to you or respect ypu as a parent.", "Not difficult to deduce when that was the first sentence of my response. \"First\" things that matter, sure. I also know that people become controlled by hormones and emotions once they create little mini me's and, respectfully, can become completely irrational when it comes to issues involving their precious darlings. \n\nLike I said, they're out of line but I don't believe this is the hill for your son's relationship with his grandparents to die on. The repeated offenses are asinine yes and make me wonder if there are other underlying issues in your relationship with them that would make them feel ok about just blatantly ignoring your wishes. But then if anyone gets emotional about young humans more than parents it's the grandparents so what do I know I just have a dog right? There's no way I could possibly have any insight.", "It\u2019s been 2 months since the last incident and we went from visiting multiple times a week and staying for hours to once a week and only staying an hour or two.", "Totally understand your stance. Thanks for the judgement.", "Actually, as a parent she has every right to expect her parents to not alter her son\u2019s appearance when she\u2019s asked them repeatedly.", "I know this is go to sound cruel but if possible they don't need to see either of your faces for at least a month if it doesn't sink in then for them then you may need to leave permanently. I'm not one to recommend cutting off family ever really but this behavior can turn into something worse. First it's hair then it's clothes then it's food then it's religion etc", "Here\u2019s the thing, she\u2019s up set, I get that, but after the first time it happened, then happened again \u2026 then again \u2026 Why is she still going back? Because it\u2019s free? She has \u201cno other choice\u201d she has a choice. If it happened once and she got a babysitter I would have agreed, but she keeps going back over and over again to the same result.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s outrageous to expect that when the parent gives rules to their childcare provider, they follow those rules (even if they\u2019re the grandparents).  It\u2019s one thing to sneak the kid a cookie but to cut their hair? I would have freaked out also. \n\nHowever, I agree with you that she should have found alternate childcare right away. Personally, I would have put an end to babysitting after the first haircut.", "NTA I agree unsupervised visits are a privilege, one earned not a right and honestly after cutting hus hair the first time I would have cut off that privilege.  You don't adjust the appearance of a child beyond changing clothing when needed without a parents express permission.", "NTA. If you were looking for a reason to keep your son away from them, you would have taken the one they gave you the first time they cut his hair.", "NTA and don\u2019t let them gaslight you", "Nta. I'm telling you now this won't stop. They don't value as a mother, they think they know best. They don't. No more visits without you & your husband present. You are the parent, end of discussion.", "NTA. You're even being nice and giving them yet another chance. They have no business going against your wishes, and have shown they can't be trusted.", "NTA they should never be left alone with your kid again.", "NTA. No grandparents is better than abusive grandparents that have fights with his parents, trust me. You are doing a very good thing by setting expectations now before he gets older. Go no or low contact for several months, then you can revisit and see if they will respect your boundaries. If they think it's bad for his hair to be in his eyes, tell them you've consulted with your family physician and they think it's fine. Then tell them the discussion is over. If they fuck up again, go no contact for even longer. I have a feeling they will get in line soon, even if they whine about it.", "Sounds like ***you*** ***should*** keep you child away from them. Time to invest in a good babysitter or any other child care option. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Fool me once, fool me twice.", "NTA. I would have stopped this shit after the very first time. They would never see him again if there were a second time.", "Keep being LC. Don't give them ANY updates, **WHAT. SO. EVER.**   \nThey seem to have a problem with the color of the hair, and that's enough of that. \n\nIf they push, go NC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NTA**", "NTA. They are way over the line of what is appropriate.", "NTA. I grew up without grandparents. First one died in the late 1950s, last one died in 1980 which was 5 years before I was born. Your parents don't respect you and they are constantly cutting your son's hair to get a rise out of you and it worked each time. You are LC now, but have they made any comment or attempts to see your son again?", "NTA. Honestly, the second time it happened, I would have cut them off from seeing my child at all until they learned how to act better and respect me as the parent. At the very least (if you don\u2019t want to cut them off completely until they learn how to act), they wouldn\u2019t be unsupervised ever again. I wouldn\u2019t even give the opportunity for a 3rd time. Also, no a kid doesn\u2019t NEED grandparents. Being a grandparent and getting to see your grandkids is a privilege, not a right. Especially when they don\u2019t listen, stomp boundaries, and make decisions for YOUR child. Plenty of kids don\u2019t have grandparents and they\u2019re perfectly fine without them.", "NTA. Your very reasonable request was ignored.", "NTA.\n\n> ... they will not have access to my son in any way other than supervised visits on my time. No more overnights, no more day visits without myself or my partner present.\n\nThis is the right thing to do.", "NTA Quite frankly, for me, 3 strikes and you're out.  I would just go ahead and cut them out and make them grovel to see your child.  They clearly do not respect your boundaries and think they have some kind of rights to do whatever they want to your child.", "NTA and they can still be grandparents if you want them in his life.\nThey can not be left alone with him because they have more than proved that they will not respect you as his parent.", "NTA and the first haircut? That\u2019s a big deal. You\u2019re not wrong.", "Geezus. This almost needs to be on the Entitled Parents sub. NTA at all, and I'm honestly surprised you didn't do it after the second time. Stand your ground, they'll either get the point or they won't. But either way, you've done the right thing.", "NTA. Haircuts are a symptom, not the problem. \n\nAre they going to baptize him or give him religious instruction without consent? Are they going to circumcise him or pierce his ears? Do you trust them at all? \n\nI'd say that they've earned three or six months of supervised visitation or zoom visits. Next time double it. And double it again. Zoom visits are a good way to stay connected without risking anyone's safety. \n\nAlso, depending on where you are, cutting someone's hair without consent can be considered assault. I'd start mailing her articles about court cases and trials about hair... also if she has a cat or a dog, I'd be shaving racing stripes on the sides to help it go faster. It shouldn't hurt because it's just hair right?", "Your kid doesn't need grandparents that openly disregard his parents. You're NTA, and they've had their three strikes. They don't deserve a fourth chance.", "Your mom is out of line here. My nephew has curly hair. His mom kept it long when he was a baby, and I hated it. But it wasn't my kid, so I said nothing and especially, did nothing. Not my kid. Not my choice. NTA", "Your son can\u2019t have a healthy relationship with people who don\u2019t respect and deliberately undercut his mother. Right now, it\u2019s hair. What\u2019s the next thing they take it upon themselves to do over your objections? Give him food you said no to? Expose him to people you\u2019re uncomfortable with? Let him play with animals whose behavior makes you nervous? \n\nYou aren\u2019t overreacting. Personally, I don\u2019t think you were nearly as angry as you should\u2019ve been after the first incident. You should\u2019ve taken your current stance the first time. This isn\u2019t about a haircut. It\u2019s about their repeated refusal to respect you as his mom. NTA. This is the correct hill.", "NTA .. and also it's such a risk to put scissors near a toddler's face!  Do not leave him unsupervised with them!!\n\nIt is most definitely a gender thing that's making them crazy, so next time they see him, make sure his nails are painted.", "Cutting his hair without your consent is abuse. You could actually file charges.", "A child needs parents..not grandparents. That\u2019s just an added bonus.", "This is legally assault in my area. A non parent cannot legally cut the hair of a minor, in some cases even if they have custody. \n\nNo grands are better than bad grands. Get alternative childcare lined up.", "NTA.\n\nI grew up with 0 grandparents.  I'm 60 now.  It hasn't affected me yet.\n\nI would have gone supervised visits after the *FIRST* haircut.  NC after the 2nd cut.\n\nMy \"parents\" were also narcissists.  Drastic measures are required.", "NTA. And stop just telling them and warning them. You should have ended unsupervised visits after the first event. What they did was actually assault. You need to tell them that.", ">They told me I was looking for any reason to keep my son away from them. \n\nMaybe they should stop giving you a reason. NTA", "NTA \n\nYour son doesn't need grandparents, particularly when they feel they have rights equal to the actual parents.", "YTA for letting these people, who don't care about your boundaries AT ALL, anywhere near your son.", "I never met any of my grandparents as they had all died before I was adopted. I did have a Grandma figure - a lovely elderly lady that was a former neighbor of my parents and was in my life through to my early teens - found family if you will.\n\nGood grandparents enhance your life, bad grandparents harm your life.", "Just went through a similar thing with MIL\u2019s parents. They\u2019ve about lost all privileges with out baby girl for the time being. \n\nGrandparents (and other family in general) need to learn how to stay in line. It\u2019s disgusting what they think they\u2019re entitled to.", "And no one needs toxic grandparents. This has a homophobic/gender norm/boys can't have longer hair feeling to me. Either that, or massive control issues?", "yeah... I can guarantee that your son does not need grandparents who repeatedly disrespect his mother in front of him in his life.", "I literally could not agree more.", "I never particularly had grandparents. I had one grandma who's dementia was too advanced for us to ever get to know each other and another who I met four or five times because my mum didn't want anything to do with her father. \n\nIt would have been nice to have grandparents in my life and I occasionally got jealous of friends who got to have grandparents, but in no way did I need them. \n\nI know my mum feels guilty sometimes that we didn't have access to her parents, but I will tell you what I always tell her: I am so grateful that she protected me and my brother from people who would have caused us harm.", "Both of my kids were almost 2 before they got their fist haircut. I have a son and a daughter. I\u2019d have lost my shit if anyone cut their hair without my permission.", "I would not leave the child alone with them again for a very long time.\nThey don\u2019t respect OP.\nThey won\u2019t respect religious beliefs, screen time rules, dietary restrictions, gender identity or anything OP sets limits on", "They can have visits with you present.\nYou can drop by for coffee or invite them over for dinner.\nThey don\u2019t need to be alone with your child.", "NTA. They think they get to make the decisions, that they have authority over you, the parents. You need to disabuse them of this idea or you will always have problems. I suggest you follow through on exactly what you said. They can only see their grandchild at your house when you are supervising. Tell them this will last for one year, then you will reassess. If there are further problems, you will make supervision permanent. They have broken your trust and need to earn it back.", "Family doesn't have to be those who are blood relatives. I prefer to think of family as people who you know will absolutely have your back 100% and you'd have theirs as opposed to the whole \"blood is thicker than water\" schtick some (usually abusive) people like to use.", "Just because they are family isn\u2019t excuse for them to treat you terrible. They are supposed to treat you better than strangers. Idk if you are aware but technically it is assault they cut his hair without parental permission. You could technically press charges for it. Im not saying you have to but just some information. They broke the law three times", "It also makes me wonder if there's a gender issue here - are the grandparents uncomfortable with a boy having longer hair, and feel that they need to \"fix\" it so that he fits clearly into their idea of a boy? If so, the haircut won't be the last problem you have with them. NTA.", "NTA GOOD grandparents are a gift. Sucky ones are a curse.", "NTA but girlll stop \n\nBeing grandparents is a PRIVILEGE not a right.\n\nThey need to now show and prove to you that they can abide to YOUR RULES as his mother otherwise it can go from supervised visits to no visits. Heck it's better to have no relationship with people who aren't on your team vs going against you.", "Sorry, but this just isn\u2019t true. When your parents are assaulting your child (which is what this is), you figure shit out. \n\nIt\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t have any other choice. It\u2019s that you chose not to find another option.", "Exactly my point. She kept returning, it couldn\u2019t have been that bad if she keeps letting them watch him. She only changed her tune after I called her out, and THEN SAID she\u2019s taking her son over less and less."]}
