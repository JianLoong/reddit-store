When he was born, he had a head full of copper-red hair. He had the cutest little baby curls and I wanted to keep his hair long for as long as I could manage it. I\u2019d planned on cutting his hair after his first birthday. \n\nWhen my son was 10 months old, my mom cut my son\u2019s hair without my permission. She didn\u2019t contact me, never asked my opinion, nothing. She and my dad were keeping him for me at the time, and I found out she cut his hair when I went to pick him up. I was LIVID. I wanted to be there for my little boy\u2019s first haircut, and I didn\u2019t want it to be so early. I wanted him to grow his curls because I thought he was so adorable and handsome with his brand new penny copper hair. They both told me I was being irrational when I blew up over it. I asked them then not to ever cut his hair without consulting me first. \n\nMonths later, we started going to a stylist for his haircuts that I really like. She\u2019s great with him, he loves getting his hair cut by her, and it\u2019s a nice outing for us as mother/son or a family if his dad comes. It\u2019s something I enjoy, and something he enjoys. Apparently, my mother doesn\u2019t like the way this girl cuts my son\u2019s hair because she cut his hair AGAIN on a visit, without consulting me, and gapped up and ruined his cute little boy hair cut. Again, I asked her not to cut his hair without running it by me first. \n\nA month ago, my son stayed with my parents for two nights because I worked a late shift and my husband was gone for work. The second night, after my shift, my mother sent me a picture of his \u201cnew\u201d haircut that she, once again, did herself. I was seeing red. I\u2019d asked her twice now not to cut his hair without my knowledge. Her reasoning this time was \u201cAt least I sent you a picture of it.\u201d\n\nWhen I picked my son up, I went off. I told both of them that under no circumstances were they allowed to alter his appearance in any way, haircuts included. I told them I\u2019d already asked twice that they not, and they went against me as a mother, so this time I\u2019m not asking. I told both of  them explicitly if his hair was cut ever again while under their care, they will not have access to my son in any way other than supervised visits on my time. No more overnights, no more day visits without myself or my partner present. \n\nThey were not very happy about this. They told me I was looking for any reason to keep my son away from them. They told me I was being irrational over nothing. They went as far as telling me it was borderline abuse to let my son\u2019s hair grow over his eyes. At that point, I left, and I\u2019ve been LC and no visits since. \n\nI know my son needs grandparents, and I want him to have a healthy relationship with them, but I\u2019m tired of my wishes as a mother going unheard. \n\nAITA for threatening their relationship over this?", "created_utc": 1672313435, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy37oq/aita_for_threatening_my_parents_time_with_my_son/", "score": 2192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Any damage to their relationship with their grandchild is their own doing. It takes very little effort not to give this child a haircut\n\nHe's getting more haircuts than any other toddler on the planet at this point. Completely unnecessary on their part and they have to be doing it just to get you mad", "NTA - This is the only way to make it stop. Make sure you follow through with a healthy dose of consequence. At least a month for each offense wouldn't be unreasonable.  In the future, start as you intend to continue. Lay down the rules and consequences, since you are now having to play hardball. When they deliberately defy you, enact the punishment, doubling each time. So they've earned a 6 month timeout, and next time, it will be a year. I did this once, a two year timeout. Never had another problem.", "NTA, you were explicit about not cutting his hair and they continued to do it. Which seems an odd hill for them to die on, but I guess that's their choice. \n\nI have an acquaintance who did a similar thing with the grandchild (despite her daughter asking her not to repeatedly) and then would brag 'she can't tell me what to do' and this makes me think of her.", "NTA\nsounds like you have been very clear about your expectations and they're not respecting that. Tough situation but keep in mind that if they aren't respectful now who us to say they'll ever be respectful? Also start keeping a paper trail....They're saying that his long hair is neglectful on your part and that's an odd accusation.\n\nA healthy relationship can have boundaries. Looks like you'll need to find an overnight sitter for a bit.", "NTA. Your issue here is you let this happen 3 times before you exploded, I would have exploded the first time and went LC until I received an actual apology.\n\nThey are not the parents, you are.

They sure are though.  That would be the end of the relationship in my book.  I don\u2019t care if we are related.   You disrespect me and my boundaries/my child and I have every right to go NC.  Being family does not entitle people to be a**holes and treat you like a doormat.

If they won't accept your (perfectly reasonable) boundaries about this, then I'd be worried about what other boundaries they will boldly break. This is a power move - a weird one, but it's odd that anyone cares that much about someone else's hair - and is completely and blatantly disrespectful towards you. You told them not to, they keep doing it anyway. I wouldn't have let them watch my child after the first time, and certainly not after the second.", "NTA\n\nIt's kind of irrelevant what the thing that they did is, ie the haircut.

They show no interest in your parental choices, and think it\u2019s fine to dismiss your authority. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no other way to teach them how wrong they are than by flexing that authority. Show them you\u2019re willing to do so, and perhaps they\u2019ll start to respect your authority.

They\u2019re being AHs by ignoring the boundary, by insisting it\u2019s a ridiculous boundary, and by telling you your enforcement of the boundary is the real problem.\n\n\u201cThey told me it was borderline abuse to let my son\u2019s hair grow over his eyes.\u201d PUH-LEASE.", "NTA. It feels like they\u2019re punishing you because you dared to set a boundary - at this point, your kid\u2019s hair just happens to be the object of the boundary stomping.", "NTA\n\nThe first time it happened it could have been forgivable if it hadn't happened twice more. Now, they're knowingly going against your wishes. \n\nYour stipulations for supervised visits should happen sooner, in my opinion.

It\u2019s not even about the haircuts, it\u2019s about trust. \n\nI get my kids\u2019 hair cut at Fantastic Sam\u2019s sometimes, so I\u2019m  not someone who cares a lot about haircuts. But if either set of grandparents violated my explicit instructions as yours have done THREE times over ANY issue, where I\u2019d made it clear this was something important to me and there was no room ambiguity, I\u2019d be cutting them off or threatening to cut them off from unsupervised time as well. \n\nIf they can\u2019t follow basic instructions on little (or not so little) stuff, I\u2019d have a hard time trusting them to follow my instructions on any future issue. What if a medical issue came up, and I couldn\u2019t trust them? And I wouldn\u2019t trust that they\u2019d let me take the lead on some of the big conversations you have as a parent (not sure what your parents are like, but would they impose religious beliefs on your kid you don\u2019t subscribe to? Would they follow your guidance on how you plan to talk to your kid about topics such as strangers, privacy, etc?)\n\nI think you can give them an opportunity to earn back your trust, but their inability to even recognize that they have violated it is concerning. \n\nAnyhow, you weren\u2019t threatening their relationship originally, because you allowed for the possibility of visits, as long as you were present. You weren\u2019t trying to keep your son away from them, just saying they couldn\u2019t have him unsupervised.

The time to react would have been the first time it happened.   The second time?  You should have never brought him there again.  I'm honestly confused as to why you keep bringing him there.  Are you depending on them for childcare?", "ESH.\n\nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I don't understand how it happened for a 3rd time.\n\nYour parents should have lost unsupervised visits the first time they cut your kid's hair.", "NTA but don't go overboard here maybe stop bringing him around for a while but don't completely cut them off just yet.

Grandparents' rights are something that normally only comes into play after a divorce or death of one of the parents, and the custodial/remaining parent stops allowing the grandparents on their former spouse's side to have contact with the child when there originally was regular contact. The point is to address alienation by a vindictive spouse, not to arbitrarily overrule parents' wishes.\n\nObviously, it's not a cut and dried issue, and there's overzealous lawyers and judges that might see otherwise, but grandparents' rights aren't typically something that is assumed to exist.", "My kids couldn't stand having their hair hanging in front of their eyes obstructing their vision.
