When he was born, he had a head full of copper-red hair. He had the cutest little baby curls and I wanted to keep his hair long for as long as I could manage it. I\u2019d planned on cutting his hair after his first birthday. \n\nWhen my son was 10 months old, my mom cut my son\u2019s hair without my permission. She didn\u2019t contact me, never asked my opinion, nothing. She and my dad were keeping him for me at the time, and I found out she cut his hair when I went to pick him up. I was LIVID. I wanted to be there for my little boy\u2019s first haircut, and I didn\u2019t want it to be so early. I wanted him to grow his curls because I thought he was so adorable and handsome with his brand new penny copper hair. They both told me I was being irrational when I blew up over it. I asked them then not to ever cut his hair without consulting me first. \n\nMonths later, we started going to a stylist for his haircuts that I really like. She\u2019s great with him, he loves getting his hair cut by her, and it\u2019s a nice outing for us as mother/son or a family if his dad comes. It\u2019s something I enjoy, and something he enjoys. Apparently, my mother doesn\u2019t like the way this girl cuts my son\u2019s hair because she cut his hair AGAIN on a visit, without consulting me, and gapped up and ruined his cute little boy hair cut. Again, I asked her not to cut his hair without running it by me first. \n\nA month ago, my son stayed with my parents for two nights because I worked a late shift and my husband was gone for work. The second night, after my shift, my mother sent me a picture of his \u201cnew\u201d haircut that she, once again, did herself. I was seeing red. I\u2019d asked her twice now not to cut his hair without my knowledge. Her reasoning this time was \u201cAt least I sent you a picture of it.\u201d\n\nWhen I picked my son up, I went off. I told both of them that under no circumstances were they allowed to alter his appearance in any way, haircuts included. I told them I\u2019d already asked twice that they not, and they went against me as a mother, so this time I\u2019m not asking. I told both of  them explicitly if his hair was cut ever again while under their care, they will not have access to my son in any way other than supervised visits on my time. No more overnights, no more day visits without myself or my partner present. \n\nThey were not very happy about this. They told me I was looking for any reason to keep my son away from them. They told me I was being irrational over nothing. They went as far as telling me it was borderline abuse to let my son\u2019s hair grow over his eyes. At that point, I left, and I\u2019ve been LC and no visits since. \n\nI know my son needs grandparents, and I want him to have a healthy relationship with them, but I\u2019m tired of my wishes as a mother going unheard. \n\nAITA for threatening their relationship over this?", "created_utc": 1672313435, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy37oq/aita_for_threatening_my_parents_time_with_my_son/", "score": 1055, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Any damage to their relationship with their grandchild is their own doing. It takes very little effort not to give this child a haircut\n\nHe's getting more haircuts than any other toddler on the planet at this point. Completely unnecessary on their part and they have to be doing it just to get you mad", "NTA - This is the only way to make it stop. Make sure you follow through with a healthy dose of consequence. At least a month for each offense wouldn't be unreasonable.  In the future, start as you intend to continue. Lay down the rules and consequences, since you are now having to play hardball. When they deliberately defy you, enact the punishment, doubling each time. So they've earned a 6 month timeout, and next time, it will be a year. I did this once, a two year timeout. Never had another problem.", "NTA, you were explicit about not cutting his hair and they continued to do it. Which seems an odd hill for them to die on, but I guess that's their choice. \n\nI have an acquaintance who did a similar thing with the grandchild (despite her daughter asking her not to repeatedly) and then would brag 'she can't tell me what to do' and this makes me think of her.", "NTA\nsounds like you have been very clear about your expectations and they're not respecting that. Tough situation but keep in mind that if they aren't respectful now who us to say they'll ever be respectful? Also start keeping a paper trail....They're saying that his long hair is neglectful on your part and that's an odd accusation.\n\nA healthy relationship can have boundaries. Looks like you'll need to find an overnight sitter for a bit.", "NTA. Your issue here is you let this happen 3 times before you exploded, I would have exploded the first time and went LC until I received an actual apology.\n\nThey are not the parents, you are.

They sure are though.  That would be the end of the relationship in my book.  I don\u2019t care if we are related.   You disrespect me and my boundaries/my child and I have every right to go NC.  Being family does not entitle people to be a**holes and treat you like a doormat.

If they won't accept your (perfectly reasonable) boundaries about this, then I'd be worried about what other boundaries they will boldly break. This is a power move - a weird one, but it's odd that anyone cares that much about someone else's hair - and is completely and blatantly disrespectful towards you. You told them not to, they keep doing it anyway. I wouldn't have let them watch my child after the first time, and certainly not after the second.", "NTA\n\nIt's kind of irrelevant what the thing that they did is, ie the haircut.

They show no interest in your parental choices, and think it\u2019s fine to dismiss your authority. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no other way to teach them how wrong they are than by flexing that authority. Show them you\u2019re willing to do so, and perhaps they\u2019ll start to respect your authority.

They\u2019re being AHs by ignoring the boundary, by insisting it\u2019s a ridiculous boundary, and by telling you your enforcement of the boundary is the real problem.\n\n\u201cThey told me it was borderline abuse to let my son\u2019s hair grow over his eyes.\u201d PUH-LEASE.", "NTA. It feels like they\u2019re punishing you because you dared to set a boundary - at this point, your kid\u2019s hair just happens to be the object of the boundary stomping.", "NTA\n\nThe first time it happened it could have been forgivable if it hadn't happened twice more. Now, they're knowingly going against your wishes. \n\nYour stipulations for supervised visits should happen sooner, in my opinion.

It\u2019s not even about the haircuts, it\u2019s about trust. \n\nI get my kids\u2019 hair cut at Fantastic Sam\u2019s sometimes, so I\u2019m  not someone who cares a lot about haircuts. But if either set of grandparents violated my explicit instructions as yours have done THREE times over ANY issue, where I\u2019d made it clear this was something important to me and there was no room ambiguity, I\u2019d be cutting them off or threatening to cut them off from unsupervised time as well. \n\nIf they can\u2019t follow basic instructions on little (or not so little) stuff, I\u2019d have a hard time trusting them to follow my instructions on any future issue. What if a medical issue came up, and I couldn\u2019t trust them? And I wouldn\u2019t trust that they\u2019d let me take the lead on some of the big conversations you have as a parent (not sure what your parents are like, but would they impose religious beliefs on your kid you don\u2019t subscribe to? Would they follow your guidance on how you plan to talk to your kid about topics such as strangers, privacy, etc?)\n\nI think you can give them an opportunity to earn back your trust, but their inability to even recognize that they have violated it is concerning. \n\nAnyhow, you weren\u2019t threatening their relationship originally, because you allowed for the possibility of visits, as long as you were present. You weren\u2019t trying to keep your son away from them, just saying they couldn\u2019t have him unsupervised.

The time to react would have been the first time it happened.   The second time?  You should have never brought him there again.  I'm honestly confused as to why you keep bringing him there.  Are you depending on them for childcare?", "ESH.\n\nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I don't understand how it happened for a 3rd time.\n\nYour parents should have lost unsupervised visits the first time they cut your kid's hair.", "NTA but don't go overboard here maybe stop bringing him around for a while but don't completely cut them off just yet.

And no, Grandparents aren't a necessity, especially disrespectful ones like this..", "NTA. \n\nI took before and after pictures and saved the curls when my guy got his first haircut. Sorry you didn't get that :( \n\nAfter that one, I wasn't fussed about who took him for future cuts or did it, as long as he was happy about it. So my mom had taken him a few times. He has since decided he wants to grow out his hair, so I've made sure everyone knows that and NOT to cut it. \n\nYou've established hair cutting as a boundary and he's still young enough that  you're the gatekeeper there. \n\nIf he was older and expressed independently about wanting a haircut while with them, there's some gray zone.\n\nIf you had never discussed your intention with his hair, I could see giving them a chance after the first haircut since its NBD to some people. But I assume you made it clear at that one that it was a hard nope. So should have cut them off after the 2nd failure. If they knew you were looking forward to being there for the 1st haircut, they were being cruel to you intentionally. And that's a toxic environment for your son to be in. \n\nAre you in any therapy to help deal with coming from such a narcissistic family?", "NTA. The same happened to me with my son, except I made the threat after the first haircut (and it was my in-laws)", "They had warnings, they obviously aren't going to stop. And I wouldn't put it past them to try to get away with more things while unsupervised, he doesn't need grandparents that don't resect his actual parents. And you don't need the kind of stress that comes with dealing with their boundary stomping every time you leave them alone with him. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Its obvious they don't respect your wishes. You've repeatedly asked them not to cut his hair without your permission as is your right since you birthed him, not them. And he's under your custody. \n\nBoth sides of my grandparents died before I was born and when I was really young. They also don't live close enough for me to see them, so I never really got spend long periods of time with them. There's no requirement that says your children need to have grandparents in their life really, it's more about whether it's possible. \n\nIf they continue to disrespect your wishes, then it's better if you distance yourself and your son from them. They're acting like it's their actual child and will continue to shape him as they see fit without your permission.", "NTA.\n\nWho doesn't know that you never cut a kid's hair without asking, especially when it's possible that it would be their first haircut?  That's a milestone for many parents.\n\nThey're clearly embarrassed by any hint of effeminate appearance.  That's what's going on here.  Even if they feel it will cause issues later on, it's not their call.  It's very, very rare that overriding a parent is justified and necessary.  Parents generally make the calls whether you agree with them or not.  If your son is mortified when he gets older and you made the wrong call in his opinion, that's going to be between the two of you.", "NTA. Not in the slightest. Your child, your rules. There are consequences for breaking the rules.", "NTA - decades ago my brother and his wife let their little boy's hair get long.  It was about shoulder length, curls at the bottom and black. With his big blue yes and long eyelashes , he was stunning.  My parents hated it (being an older generation) and kept saying he looked like a little girl.  Even though they were opinionated and outspoken they would have never cut his hair!", "Nta you told them twice not to cut your son hair. I would had not let them see him after the 2nd time. They are tah", "NTA they're a causing you of being an abusive parent and have lead themselves to believe that you're keeping their grandchild from them. They are going to continue to escalate this behavior, if they end up talking to another else about this and accusing you of being abusive like this you're going to get a CPS visit because of them.\n\n\nI would not wait until the next time, I wouldn't let them keep the child anymore and would only allow supervised interaction. If their pattern of behavior generally speaking is this problematic, I would keep it to supervised visits forever. \n\n>I know my son needs grandparents\n\nLiterally millions of people don't have grandparents", "NTA  Their behavior is controlling and ridiculous. How would they have reacted if their parents had cut YOUR hair when you were little?", "NTA- it IS absolutely a big deal. Your mom has zero say in how you style your baby\u2019s hair. Full stop. She is out of line. It\u2019s a breech of trust.  My mom is still salty about the time my paternal grandma cut my hair when I was a toddler, lol! (I\u2019m 47!)  you should tell her it\u2019s not just about the hair, you no longer trust her. Trust is a precious thing and she ruined it.", "NTA.  They clearly don\u2019t respect you as a parent: if they will blatantly ignore this boundary, what else will they do against your wishes?", "NTA. Been in a similar spot myself. My dad is obsessed with hair and won\u2019t stop mentioning his preference for short hair (on both girls and boys). I lived through this as a child. He would not STOP talking about my hair and trying to get it to be shorter and shorter (like I\u2019d be playing Barbies alone and he\u2019d come up behind me and ride my case about my shoulder-length hair not being good enough). He has a ton of boundary issues and is a generally controlling person who does not listen. And he is also perpetually in a bad mood. So fast-forward and now he\u2019s always in my ear and my kids\u2019 ears, telling them either that their short hair looks great (over-praise) or that their hair is too long and making them unable to function (over-criticism). Like they won\u2019t be able to see or play because their hair will be in their line of vision. So my daughter hears him go ga-ga over one of my son\u2019s haircuts and cuts her hair herself on my folks\u2019 watch. My parents deny that the haircut happened on their watch and that my dad\u2019s comments were the impetus. I tell them both to STOP talking about hair to my kids. And I try to keep the kids\u2019 hair shorter. They do not stop. My daughter does it again. I scream. They insist again that my dad had \u201cnothing to do with it.\u201d I stop letting my dad see my daughter. My mom comes over when I\u2019m at work and my husband is home. She invites my dad. I tell everyone my dad is not allowed to see my daughter. My mom babysits when I\u2019m at work and invited my dad again. I can\u2019t do anything because we needed the child-watching (husband was at work). We all meet for the holidays and my dad goes bonkers complimenting one of my son\u2019s haircuts, again, like last time. I tell him to stop. He gets snippy. I tell him more loudly to stop. He says he is just trying to give my son a compliment. My dad hates me, I feel, and will never listen to me or anyone else. And my mom loves him to pieces. Empathy, OP. We\u2019re both screwed.", "NTA. First off, your son doesn\u2019t NEED grandparents. He especially does not need ones that clearly do not respect you. Secondly, time with their grandchildren is a privilege, not a right. Stay strong, if they actually want a relationship they will come around. But if you give in at this point, they\u2019ll never respect you.", "NTA, my daughter didn\u2019t want her sons ( my grandsons) hair cut until the were a year old (they\u2019re twins) . I thought that when their hair was shaggy and bangs were in their eyes she should have it cut. I told her that. She said no. End of story there. We did go after they were a year old to a barber shop, her , my husband and myself. PopPop got his hair cut first in front of them and then each one sat in PopPop\u2019s lap and had his hair cut. I paid. Since then I have taken them for haircuts and she has taken them. They are 9 now. They wanted to let their hair grow. To me they look to shaggy but until they and their mother says they are ready to cut it I\u2019m going to leave it alone. She might go get it cut and I\u2019ll not know until it\u2019s done and next I see them. She might get me to take them for her and pay for it, she might be there or not. The hair might grow until they look like Rapunzel, I can give my opinion, I will get it cut if everyone is ok with it, but I don\u2019t get to decide because I\u2019m the grandmother not the parent or the kid.", "NTA", "NTA but why would you want to have your son to have a relationship with people who don\u2019t respect you.  There\u2019s no real reason to do it \u201cjust because they\u2019re family.\u201d  \n\nThey know they can keep stepping over your authority as a parent, so why let them see him? Get a restraining order.", "NTA\n\nthis is, on its own,not a huge issue itself, because it\u2019s just hair.\n\n\nHowever, the implications of them completely ignoring your wants and doing what they think is best sounds like a DISASTER for all types of future issues.", "NTA, your parents are blatantly ignoring you and your wishes.", "Don't use these parents for childcare", "Stop leaving him with them.", "NTA.  That's so mean of your mother.  When my son was around 5, his father (my ex) married my son's stepmother.  She decided she would \"save us all money\" by cutting his hair, and she butchered it several times.  It was so bad that cashiers in stores would as if he had gotten ahold of scissors and cut it himself.  I had to ask, then demand that she not cut his hair ever again.  It's very presumptuous of your mother to go against your wishes.  Can you find another babysitter?", "There is zero chance I would allow him to be alone with them anymore after this blatant disrespect. Who knows what else they\u2019re doing against your wishes behind your back, this is just something visible. He\u2019s getting older and soon they will start to tell him \u201cmommy doesn\u2019t have to know\u201d. Maybe this is a little close to home since I have an 11 month old but I am livid on your behalf. NTA", "**NTA!**\n\nGrandparents who don\u2019t respect your boundaries don\u2019t get 1 on 1 dime with the grandkids. This is entirely dependent on them respecting a single boundary. They choice is theirs. \n\nHonestly I cut contact from anyone who can\u2019t take responsibility for their own actions. Multiple counts of Gaslighting/stonewalling is met with loss of the relationship. They can respect me or they can lose me.", "NTA. You're doing the right thing. They've intentionally ignored your requests multiples times. They know what they're doing. This is they leverage you have to compel them, so use it", "Holy shit, NTA I know at this point it is just a haircut but honestly they went against your wishes after you repeatedly asked them not to.\n\nIt's not a major leap to believe that they won't overstep their boundaries regarding something else. Regardless of whether they think its pety to them, its obviously not to you the child's parent.\n\nI wouldn't let them see him without you period, until they can show an understanding of why they have done this.", "NTA - good luck ... might need to go NC ... they are boundary crossers ... hair today, who knows what tomorrow", "NTA. How disrespectful and entitled", "NTA. I'd be pissed as well!!", "Other than giving them two chances too many, you're NTA.", "No one needs grandparents, periods.  NTA.", "NTA. And your comments show an even larger pattern of ignoring your boundaries and not respecting you as the parent. \n\nI am very close with my family BECAUSE of having respect and boundaries. Toxic people are toxic whether they're your parents or not. They've shown you that you can't trust them. \n\nWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them. \n\nIt's haircuts now, what will it be when he's older? Especially old enough to understand that it doesn't matter if mom says no bc grandma and grandpa are just going to say yes and do whatever they want. \n\nPut them in timeout. No unsupervised visits ever, but a timeout from all visits for a period of time (a month, 6 months, until they apologize, etc.) would be super reasonable.", "Yes, I thought that was strange too.

NTA OP, but your mom sure tf is", "While your heart is in the right place, you might want to look in to the reasons grandparents' rights are recognized. In general, grandparents don't have a right to see a child if both parents, or the parent that is the child of the grandparents seeking visitation, doesn't want them to. Grandparents' rights are something that normally only comes into play after a divorce or death of one of the parents, and the custodial/remaining parent stops allowing the grandparents on their former spouse's side to have contact with the child when there originally was regular contact. The point is to address alienation by a vindictive spouse, not to arbitrarily overrule parents' wishes.\n\nObviously, it's not a cut and dried issue, and there's overzealous lawyers and judges that might see otherwise, but grandparents' rights aren't typically something that is assumed to exist.", "My kids couldn't stand having their hair hanging in front of their eyes obstructing their vision. Especially my younger daughter with ADHD couldn't cope with it moving in front of her eyes and touching her face. I don't think it's fair for a child to obstruct their vision when they are too young to express themselves about it and hair should be kept in a pony tail or similar until they are old enough to state an opinion and deal with it themselves. \n\nAt no point should grandparents cut the hair of grandchildren though. My mil did this once and I'm still annoyed about it 10 years later. It's just not their decision.", "NTA. I\u2019ve only ever had my grandpa. Everyone else is dead.

Not just their daughter. You really need to step up as the mother of YOUR child and parent in *your* immediate family.\n\nI have patience with people bending the knee to narc parents until it starts affecting those around them.

But the simple fact is it\u2019s happened 3 times. It couldn\u2019t have been so life altering if she kept bringing her son back for them to watch. The first time it happened she should have made other arrangements for her son. Think about it, if it was your child would you keep dropping him off? I know I wouldn\u2019t. So, it happened once, she got a different sitter, then she would have not been the ahole, but she kept bringing him back. Her foot should have come down the first time. Or at least the second time, but for it to happen a third time? That\u2019s what makes her the ahole. Then after my comment, she tried to back pedal and say she was limiting their contact. Well if contact was limited, how did they take him again?", "It was sooo much easier to ditch toxic people before the age of cell phones and social media.
