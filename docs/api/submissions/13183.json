{"id": 13183, "submission_id": "121v3gf", "title": "AITA for asking my sister to change her daughters sh*t diaper upstairs?", "selftext": "to clarify bc it\u2019s been brought up. I\u2019m at my parents currently because I recently left my baby daddy. I was a stay at home mom for 4 1/2 years and just started my first job since then in October. My son stays here weekends. I\u2019m moving in summer because I need to save first after not making any of my own money as a stay at home mom.\n\nI (28F) live with my two parents and two sisters (22 & 21). My youngest sister has a 15 month old daughter. The dad is not in the picture and she\u2019s currently no contact with his family due to baby daddy\u2019s criminal charges. She\u2019s not doing this alone though. She pays no bills, my parents fully financially support her, she has 4 built in sitters and a few close family/friends who help when they can\u2026 you get the picture. She\u2019s got a plethora of support for her and her daughter.\n\nLately, my other sister (22f) and I have been feeling fed up with the situation. Our sister never picks up after her and her daughter. She leaves every dish she makes out, every drawer she opened open, microwave open, food all over the counters and floor, high chair filthy, her daughter dirty clothes on the floor, living room has toys everywhere, occasionally she forgets a pee diaper on the floor or tv stand, and leaves the front door open which has allowed my other sisters cat to escape this winter (don\u2019t worry we found her and she\u2019s fine). It\u2019s exhausting for us who work full time to come home to this. The other day we spoke with her about picking up more and she basically blew us off. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, I was cleaning up after my son (5) and I smelled rancid toddler poop. I told my sister her daughter pooped and it smelled so bad to please change it upstairs. My other sister and my son chimed in asking to change it upstairs because it smelled so bad. She completely ignored us and just plopped her on the ground and started change her. We begged her to go up as she was undressing her and getting a diaper. She refused. I\u2019m at my wits end so I told her she\u2019s so rude. And that she sucks bc she has 0 respect or common courtesy to those around her. I called her spoiled as well. She ended up storming out and going to her friends bc I\u2019m \u201cmean\u201d. She blocked me on everything including my number. I honestly feel like I\u2019m justified because this is months of pent up frustrations & to be frank I could\u2019ve been way meaner. AITA?\n\n**Update: my sister and I squashed it. I\u2019m going to work on communicating my frustrations in the moment instead of letting it build up. She will work on keeping the house more tidy and be more mindful of things like closing the microwave and cabinets. She will also change the really smelly diapers upstairs. \nAnd just so we are clear here. No one\u2019s life is perfect. No one can plan from point a to point b without a fork in the road occasionally. Passing judgement on those who need help will never be a good look. It\u2019s okay to lean on those who are your support system in times of need. It doesn\u2019t make you a freeloader or a bad person. It makes you a human being who needs help. It\u2019s ok to need help sometimes y\u2019all!
