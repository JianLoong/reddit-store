June had just transferred to this course from another one and that had been her first day. I asked him why I was being assigned a seat, and he said that maybe I could help June out because we\u2019re both Deaf. \n\nI have hearing aids, and while they are helpful I still need an interpreter to get through my classes. The university would have assigned one for June as well, if she knew how to sign. June had gotten a cochlear implant as a kid, and wasn\u2019t taught sign language. But she\u2019s been having an issue with the equipment, and hasn\u2019t been able to use it until it\u2019s replaced/fixed. But she still came to class because she needed the attendance. \n\nOur lecturer knew this, but wasn\u2019t happy that she wouldn\u2019t be able to listen to his lecture so his brilliant plan was to have her sit next to me because I would \u201csomehow\u201d be able to communicate with her. And he genuinely believed this, because he went on to stop his lecture twice to ask me why I wasn\u2019t talking to June. I was pretty miffed so I did file a complaint afterwards. \n\nWhen I went to his class this week, he said the complaint had been received, and apologised for making an assumption and making me uncomfortable when he had clearly been told of June\u2019s circumstances beforehand. He then said he wishes I will come to him with any complaints before escalating it to the university because it puts him in a tough spot. \n\nNow I feel bad because my lecturer is a PhD student, and he probably doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience with teaching. I don\u2019t actually want this to impact his degree.", "created_utc": 1686243409, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144elsm/aita_for_reporting_a_lecturer_for_seating_me_next/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But this falls under \"disability\" type equity which I just assume always gets escalated so that it is recorded. It is your education. Yeah, if someone else is deaf and can sign, of course you should help. But you are not an interpreter, nor are trained for it, nor should be put in that position.  \n\nI liken it to putting two one armed people together in case you need to clap during class. It is rude and isn't your job.", "NTA. Unfortunately it is up to June to advocate for themselves in order to get the accommodation they need, especially if their cochlear is malfunctioning. I wear hearing aids but don't sign, so I had a transliteration assistant who in real time would sit in class with me and type what was being said and it would pop up on my laptop. If you are in the US, the ADA is valid and she should be able to request this reasonable accommodation through the school.\n\nIt is also not wrong that you reported him. This leaves a paper trail and is also a learning experience for him as deafness / disability are on a spectrum; one solution does not fit all. Him expecting you, who is paying for a service, to add to your workload and provide accommodation for your classmate is -not- acceptable in the slightest and should most definitely have been reported. Continue to do so if he keeps up this attitude. It is not your responsibility to educate this person - it is their responsibility to do due diligence for this situation and it is plain that they did not. Not once was I ever expected or required to assist other deaf students while I was in school, and neither should you.", "NTA.\n\nUniversities have entire departments that deal with accessibility issues.  All the Prof would have had to do is contact them before he made his brilliant plan.  They would have told him that placing the onus on you wasn't how to handle this and would have helped him come up with an accommodation plan that works for the other student, and doesn't impact you in any way.  If he is smart enough to be studying for a Ph.D., then he is smart enough to make use of the resources that are on hand, or even use some flipping common sense.  I've worked in a leading University for 20 years now, and this is the kind of stupid thing my faculty members would come up with 15 years ago when accessibility wasn't as prevalent.  Now it's pretty much at the forefront of everything in higher education.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t agree that you should have spoken to him first. If you felt comfortable doing that then sure, but if you didn\u2019t feel comfortable then reporting it is fine too. Trust your instincts. The university will deal with it appropriately (hopefully) and if his degree is affected by it then that\u2019s going to be because he\u2019s done something bad enough to warrant it. It isn\u2019t your fault.\n\nHopefully your teacher will learn from it and it\u2019ll actually be better for his career in the long run.", "NTA\n\nYour lecturer did something stupid.\n\nIf the class had a signing interpreter, then it would make sense to put everyone who needs the interpreter in the same place, so you could all look at each other. And if June understood sign, then having her sit next to you and share your interpreter would have been reasonable.\n\nBut she didn't.  So I'm not sure what your lecturer was assuming here - some sort of magical Deaf telepathy?\n\nThis isn't going to impact his degree, but it is going to get him the training and advice he needs not to make stupid assumptions in the future.\n\n(But frankly, you should have told him that there was nothing you could do for June when he was assigning you to sit next to her. Yes, he was an idiot, but you had the opportunity to tell him that whatever magical Deaf communication channel he thinks might exist doesn't.)", "NTA. Your lecturer needed to learn this lesson early in his career. There is a reason there is a disabilities office. They are trained to know how to handle this situation, and they just **hate** it when professors decide they know how handle things. In addition, the lecturer violated FERPA and, probably, HIPPA (assuming you're in the US) by discussing your classmate's medical and learning conditions. It won't hurt his progress in the PhD program, and, in addition, very few programs actually cover ADA accommodations if they discuss teaching at all (and many PhD programs do not). Signed, a former professor and academic administrator.", "As a PhD student lecturer, NTA at all and please don't feel bad for the guy not havig experience with teaching. As with any job, you either get training or you put in the effort to educate yourself on what the appropriate approaches to your job and responsibilities are. This is absolutely on him as both a lecturer and a person.\n\nETA if he was, for some reason, actually learning for the first time that Deaf people aren't monolithic and can't automatically communicate with each other (absolute ableist move), he should have stfu as soon as you responded the first time. We're in the 21st century, we don't need to be needlessly authoritarian and ignore people's wishes to show that we (the lecturer) are in charge anymore.

He was ultimately wrong but meant well. I wish more people meant well.", "I\u2019m thinking since he asked you you could have (should have) said no and explained to him why it made you uncomfortable. His intentions were good but he was ignorant of your perspective as a student as well as a deaf person (who has probably been put in annoying, assumed positions like this before) But he did ask you at a certain point and it would have been best to speak up then.", "\\*Shrug.\\*\n\nI agree with your lecturer's request for you to discuss future concerns informally, but that is also why you are NTA. The department should accept the lecturer's request to approach you and ask for an opportunity to resolve any issues informally.", "(Changing to NTA).  When he assigned you the seat and explained his rationale, did you clarify for him why his reasoning was off?  If you had the opportunity to do was there but you did not speak up, part of the blame falls on you.  If he just unilaterally decided the seating arrangement without allowing you to explain, then he screwed up.  Just as he is correct that speaking to him directly would have been better, the same could be said of him with respect to his decision in the first place.", "NTA your lecturer\u2019s behaviour was not acceptable. You did the right thing by making a formal complaint. It\u2019s on the record. \n\nYour lecturer doesn\u2019t like it because he has been called out on discriminatory behaviour, actions that regardless of whether it\u2019s his first day or his last he should never have happened. Your actions will not affect his degree, his actions will.", "ESH - it was presumptuous of him to seat you two together so you could be a translator without asking your permission  but by your words you made no effort to communicate your feelings to him and instead just decided to report him. Why not be mature and simply tell him how you felt before doing something that could hurt his career? If he then refused to do anything, that would have been the time to file a complaint.", "NTA he may be new, but he needs to learn that that isn't how reasonable accommodations work. At the very least the university needs to know so they can provide him with accessibility training.", "NTA - you don\u2019t have to be specially trained to know how out of line he was in doing this - he should take it as a \u2018teaching moment\u2019 he can learn from to become better in the future.

I doubt it will impact his degree.", "NTA\n\nThe lecturer would have done nothing\n\nHe's just butthurt because he was told just how badly he screwed up and how much legal liability he put on the university by doing what he did.  \n\nWhat he did was draw attention and single out the two disabled students in his classroom.  \n\nIn no world should the people who are being singled out because of their similar disabilities be responsible for confronting the person who is singling them out\n\nThe fact he would even say that is proof positive you made the right decision by running this up the chain of command so to speak", "OP says that she did tell the professor that she wouldn't be able to help June, but prof \"just didn\u2019t believe me I guess.\"  She tried to talk to the prof and he didn't listen.

Any E-S-H or Y-T-A judgements come from people who don\u2019t understand how accommodating disabilities in academia works. And as a professor, it\u2019s part of his JOB to know these things. He didn\u2019t communicate with you or the other student before throwing you two together in a half-assed, hare-brained scheme. I know I\u2019m coming off harshly but it\u2019s not your responsibility to find accommodations for someone else, not to mention the other girl who\u2019s forced to pay for/ attend a class she\u2019s unable to understand.

They may or may not be practical, but 'didn't really have another solution' is nonsense. Also, this 'solution' failed to be a solution at all.\n\nAlso, ableism and naivite are really two sides of the same coin, most of the time. Most of the hurdles aren't intentional, but they exist because of a general lack of care to make sure they *don't* exist. That's ableism. It's ableism to put someone in a teaching position without really knowing that you can't pick a student based on a disability and assign them some duty to care for another student. (This is also on the university really - give your teachers some guidance please. So reporting is just fine: Uni can improve their side too.)", "Yup, I did tell him I wouldn\u2019t be able to help in this case he just didn\u2019t believe me I guess", "OP did communicate her feelings.

Wrong.", "Cool.  NTA.  He can't request better communication if he won't listen to you.", "An impossible responsibility at that.
