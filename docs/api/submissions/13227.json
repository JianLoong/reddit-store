Life as she knows it is over when the kid gets here.", "NTA, you didn't sign up for a baby. There should also be no expectation on her part that anyone should be doing overnights other than her.

Otherwise, you\u2019ll be here a year from now complaining that she dumped the nibling on you *again* to go out and do high school stuff with her high school friends.  You\u2019re creating an arrangement where she has to plan ahead and ask you for help, and you have the opportunity to say yes or no. \n\nAlso, you won\u2019t be up all night before a big test because of a colicky baby.", "NTA.

She's probably really scared right now and can use your support.", "NTA - Live your life the way you want. It is pretty sus that she knew super early on that she was pregnant. Get out of that house and enjoy your life.", "Since I am pretty sure you didn't tamper in any way shape or form with her protection, it's clar NTA\n\nIt's not your child and while it would be great if you help, you don't owe her that.", "NTA\n\nYou're smart to get out before the baby is born.  If you waited until after the baby was born to move, the family pressure to stay would be far higher.\n\nDon't tell your family until after you have the lease locked in.  And when you do tell them, I recommend you phrase it as \"'Moving out so they'll have more room for the baby' and 'Sis can turn my old room into a nursery'\", not \"I'm getting out to avoid raising Sister's kid'\".\n\nOnce you're out, I highly recommend that you consider having firm boundaries about babysitting and childcare and think about using your Do Not Disturb settings on your phone to reduce disruptions from your family.  For instance, you shouldn't give up going out with your friends on the weekend to babysit so your sister can go out with her friends.  And you shouldn't let your classes or studies be interrupted by phone calls or social media notifications.  \n\nIn the end, your sister chose to have this baby, and she's going to need to step up.", "NTA.  Moving earlier is better so everyone can find a new rhythm before the baby arrives.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The baby daddy promised he would stay to help and become a family but has now bailed.\n\nMe and her both live with our parents. Her, because she is 16 and me for slightly cheaper rent and because I like family. I am in university and work almost full time. I haven't got the time or energy to help raise a baby. I am not the one that's pregnant and the harsh reality is that at end of the day it is her responsibility. We aren't American so we do have a few more options here, and she did know very early on that she was pregnant. Like suspiciously early, I think she was trying to get pregnant early.\n\nWill I help out? of course. I will happily spend weekends or even overnight when the baby is older. I just don't want to spend every day around a baby.\n\nSo I have looked into house shares and have found one that I can afford. I have been given an offer and have to make a final decision soon. \n\nSomething to note is that while I didn't encourage it, she did assume I will help out a lot more such as with overnights and such, so it might ruin a few things for her. \n\nWIBTA if I moved out.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You did not get pregnant, so you do not have to be around a baby every day. I think it's wonderful that you want to choose to help her on your terms.

No one can force you to live at home.\n\nYour sister & parents lives will dramatically change soon but it\u2019s not unreasonable for you to not want to be included in that.", "NTA\n\nLive your own life, dont let her drag you down because she made a dumb decision", "NTA - Not your baby, not your responsibility.
