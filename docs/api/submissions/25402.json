And even still I\u2019m very cautious about how I am when it comes to my posts or comments about him despite the fact that I know for a fact he loved me as much as I loved him and we knew each other for 20 years when he died. He was best friends with my uncle(my uncles are young and close to my age so they\u2019re more like older brothers) and had known me and my family since we were all kids. \n\nI\u2019m glad your getting away from this friend because she\u2019s sounds exhausting.", "NTA. Your friend clearly has some issues if she can't show any empathy. I'm sure her f-buddy's family does not want to see her.", "NTA. But whilst many are calling for you to ditch her, I say stick by her. Jon Bernthal put it best \"Being a friend is not about turning your back on somebody when they do something that you find deplorable or disgusting. Your job as a friend is to make sure that they don't do it again.\" \n\nLeaving her just distances yourself from the problem, it doesn't solve it, and people will ultimately still look to you and wonder why you didn't do more. Of course you're not obligated to stand by what she has done, and you should denounce it and he honest about it. But leaving her when she's clearly emotionally wrecked by it all, and is struggling to deal with these complicated emotions won't help anybody, she'll still go to the grave, the family will still be bothered by her doing it. The best thing you can do, even if it's not as her friend but just as a person, is to help her through this time period so she can move on and stop doing what she's doing, if not for her, for the family of the man she was seeing who are undoubtedly wrecked as it is without her floating around as a constant reminder.", "You're NTA\n\nYour friend needs therapy in a big way.", "Woof! I understand, it\u2019s tough having friends who make bad choices but at the end of the day it\u2019s not your responsibility to judge her or police her actions. That being said\u2026 sleeping with a married man is rough. Kids is worse. Showing up at the funeral is unhinged, as is leaving trinkets on the grave where his actual family might see it. She needs to find a new way to grieve that doesn\u2019t interrupt their process. She lost someone close to her but they lost an integral member of their household and daily lives. She\u2019s being selfish, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going through something but that ain\u2019t it. \n\nI think you\u2019re well within your rights to cut her off. I have some chaotic friends with questionable morals, I don\u2019t agree with the comments that you should have higher standards for your friends. Like, maybe a little? If it bothers you I think it\u2019s fair to distance yourself, but you can\u2019t police the world. It sounds like you guys were friends for a long time, childhood friends sometimes go real sideways. NTA either way.", "NTA but I think people here would do better realising that most people lie to themselves before others. I don\u2019t think its sage advise to cut someone loose when they are at their weakest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just sex\u201d\n\nShe was clearly in love with this guy. I don\u2019t condone her behaviour and I feel for the family. But people commenting here, to me at least, missing the wood for the trees that she was incredibly emotionally invested. I don\u2019t think grieving the loss of your significant other is the time to expect a person to suddenly become rational to a social moral compass they have been avoiding for years. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine the wife\u2019s devastation uncovering the messages, she is defintely more of a victom. But your friend, in her world of self justifying her feelings they were together, while I think she\u2019s a lousy cheat, I also feel for her grief.\n\nI hope they all find a way to move on.", "NTA  I would definitely distance myself from her. Shes generally not a good person.", "NTA. your friend is a cheater, she deserves no sympathy. matter of fact, she deserves to be left alone in her own misery", "Nta", "This happened to me, but I was the wife. NTA, she doesn't deserve any support.", "NTA, your friend is trash.", "NTA. This sounds like an utter clusterfuck, and I wish you the best in distancing yourself. Good job questioning her behavior; I think it's good that you tried to make her see how she was being disrespectful and pushing boundaries.", "NTA your friend sounds unhinged (and not in a normal \u201cunhinged from grief\u201d way, she\u2019s like\u2026taking ownership of this man who had a wife and family and is being ludicrously disrespectful to them.  She\u2019s also clearly doing all this for HERSELF, not for \u201chim\u201d bc however, he felt about his wife. I\u2019m sure he would not have been on board with her, leaving weird love trinkets that his grave for his children to find.", "NTA. You can be friends with someone but not condone their actions.  It can get tricky sometimes, but you stand your ground. Sounds like you haven\u2019t supported her in her adventures with this guy and have tried to advise against it.\nSome times we just need to walk away for our own sanity. Maybe one day she\u2019ll get her head back on straight. Maybe she won\u2019t. I\u2019ve got \u201cfriends\u201d that only call me when they need something. I know this and it\u2019s up to me to choose how I react and if I do anything. You\u2019re in the same boat. Right how she\u2019s more drama than you need so you distance yourself. Maybe in a few years you can hang out again.", "NTA please block this disturbing individual from your life.", "She is pathetic and I wish her the worst, idk why you are friends with her, YTA only for that", "Your friend is a drama llama", "My mom died.\n\nMy dad showed up with his affair partner turned wife.\n\nShit show ensued.\n\nI shamelessly admit I hid out in the lobby with my ILs.\n\nMy dad died. His wife is now being comforted by her God-fearing family. That family was lead to believe they were both widowed and had a second chance at love", "Nah, SHE had feelings. Dead dude clearly had none.", "This!!She is still her friend and she is mourning the person she loved and died,i couldnt act this way to my friends,you dont have to agree with everything your friends do but you have to be there for them when they are grieving.", "I mean, whether it's right or not she's still clearly going through the shit and would probably benefit from counseling", "What? You don't get to invalidate a person's feelings even if they were acting terrible like this chick.", "OP please beg her to stop leaving her romantic trinkets at the gravesite. I cannot imagine the pain, humiliation, anger the wife is going through. Showing up to the gravesite after the funeral with family members only to see romantic/love affair knickknacks everywhere. Salt on an open wound. Somehow it even makes this situation worse.", "I guess I look at it like this - it isn't her responsibility to make the person she is sleeping with keep promises he has made to other people. Particularly since she may not know what they are. Should she expect this relationship to end well? Nope. But he is responsible for keeping the promises he made to his wife.", "Putting the blame on mistress when its the man in relationship who chose to cheat.She didnt make promise to his wife he did.", "She\u2019s not thinking like that. She\u2019s lost someone she loves. She also probably thinks that he loved her to take her back after she exposed their affair or at least had some very strong feelings for her. To be fair, to risk his family, (twice) he probably did. \n\nShe\u2019s grieving the loss of her love, which tbh I feel like anyone experiencing a loss is entitled to some empathy.  \n\nIn saying that, his family are planning the funeral. His family lost their dad and husband, and she also tried to take him away from them during the affair. It is unthinkably cruel to turn up to the funeral. I don\u2019t think that makes her evil (because it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s out of spite) just entirely self centered and not at all seeing that she is one of the villains in this narrative. \n\n100% she shouldn\u2019t go though. But there\u2019s a lot she shouldn\u2019t have done in this narrative already so who knows if she\u2019ll get a reality check in time for the funeral.", "*murders friend*\n\n\"I feel sad about the murder, could you comfort me?\n\nReddit: Won't someone think of this murderers feelings?!", "Uh...yea...ya do", "Her feelings are worth nothing lmao", "It is, though? It doesn't matter if you are not the one in the relationship, you have a baseline responsibility to other people not to take part in torpedoing their lives like this.\n\nYou wouldn't be allowed to punch someone in the head and say, \"Oh, well it was their spouse's responsibility to keep them safe.\" Even if their spouse laughed and joined in as you punched them, it doesn't mean punching them was okay.\n\nAnd she **knew** he was married.", "You misread. She already went to the funeral and had to get kicked out.", "No she is evil and that wife may want some revenge. I would.", "Some people need drama in their lives, in one way or another. Some people like trashy reality TV/soap operas, some like trolling/debating online, and others like watching their 'friends' lives blow up up close and personal.", "I think the person was referring to the 2010 mining disaster in Copiap\u00f3.  I vaguely recall some such rumor at the time, I don't know if it was verified or a case of two men with the same name or similar names, or some other confusion.", "Just tell anyone who asks to ask your ex friend.  \"I wouldn't want to betray her trust, even now, but perhaps she'd be willing to explain if she feels ready.\"  Then just live your new, better life.", "Thank you, I completely skipped that line, I don\u2019t know how."]}
