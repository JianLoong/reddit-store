Everything\u2019s going great til\n6 months later and after a quick morning session he tells my friend he\u2019s not feeling well. He drives home and dies after getting home. My friend finds out because she doesn\u2019t hear from him for some days and calls a mutual friend of theirs who tells her. \n\nShe\u2019s hysterical when she calls me. I get that it\u2019s a shock.

Every time we talk she\u2019s talking about him and how she\u2019s visiting his grave and is leaving little trinkets hearts and frames by his grave. \n\nI asked her if she has thought about how his wife and kids might feel about this. But she insist that she\u2019s in mourning and this is her way of dealing with it. I might be insensitive but I tell her I find it disrespectful. And that if this was her husband would she want her dead husbands f buddy doing that. So in her own words I\u2019m insensitive. And probably an ahole. I\u2019m just confused when she had told me many times that their rendezvous was just sex.

Leave the poor family alone.  I get her grief, but she is as selfish at the jerk she was \"buddies\" with.  They deserve each other.  I am generally a very sympathetic person, but this is crazy on his and her parts. Why would he risk it again?  Why would she expect him to be more again?  Crazy always finds crazy.
