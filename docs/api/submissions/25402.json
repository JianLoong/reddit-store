She is behaving terribly and forcing a widow to endure her presence. Her lack of respect for herself or anyone else has crossed over into obsessive, harmful acts and you are not required to support her delusional belief that she is entitled to display a partner's grief.

You can tell her that you can't support her behavior on this and you hope she gets some mental help, because she really needs it.", "NTA this is such a mess. I get that she\u2019s mourning (since I guess she had actual feelings for him?) but it is not her place to leave stuff at his grave. This is a place important for the children especially and constantly reminding the wife that her husband was having an affair is also really cruel.

What she has done is wrong but people do not always have a rational reaction to grief.
