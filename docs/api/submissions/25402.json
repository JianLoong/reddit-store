That is something she should keep to herself. \n\nIf she wants to be sad, she can cry in privacy, like how their \u201crelationship\u201d existed in privacy. Just because he is dead does not mean she should be able to publicize and flaunt being his mistress. It is disrespectful to the dead, and it is disrespectful to his living wife and children. Your friend needs to have some decorum, and get over herself.", "Agree", "What\u2019s wild to me is that she\u2019s been cheated on a lot in the past .", "The man's wife and children are also allowed to grieve", "My favorite part was when he got caught, his wife forgave him, then a few years later he thought \"yeah, I should do this again!\".", "Right. Out of all the fish in the sea, she chose someone else's husband. The fact that they were secret lovers probably made her have stronger feelings. Just nasty. \n\nI'm kinda wondering how OPs friend found out that the wife read the messages. And if she did, I'm willing to bet he has been with more than just one mistress.", "Or they both did that.  \n\nThe thing is, he is dead, and she is continuing to torment his wife and children with her antics.", "She had the responsibility to not fuck someone else's husband.  Now he's dead, she has the responsibility to stop harassing a grieving family.", "She re-enlisted.", "NTA if my husband were to ever cheat and then die and i see his mistress at the funeral i\u2019m turning that funeral into an MMA fight", "NTA. Your friend is messy and apparently has a different moral code than you. That could definitely lead to negative consequences in the future for you.", "Your friend sounds insufferable", "Why are you even wasting time on this person? Block your soon to be ex-friend and move on with your life. She sounds actually insane.", "He was probably doing it in the meanwhile, too, but the other women didn't tell his wife", "I personally believe that when you forgive a cheater and give them another chance, you are just giving them another chance to cheat on you. If they don't do it, great but don't get socked if do it again.", "that would require sympathy, for which she deserves non", "> at least had some very strong feelings for her. To be fair, to risk his family, (twice) he probably did\n\nNo, he just had strong dick yearnings", "NTA. Your friend has serious issues and needs therapy.", "Wow your friend is horrible", "NTA. What's she's doing is very disrespectful and insensitive.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA. Life long friends are a hard loss for sure. She is going through something that she should not even have been a part of. I don't question your morals though. She was the one doing dirty not you. Hopefully she will come out of this, but you are definitely allowed to distance yourself and protect your sanity. I wouldn't call the friendship over, but use this as a way to set some serious boundaries if you reconnect. Be kind to yourself. We don't have the ability to control others no matter how much we want to save them.", "NTA\n\n\"Mommy who is that woman coming to daddy's grave and leaving things?\"\n\n\"Well that's his very dear friend Jason, she's as devastated as you were.\"\n\n\\*to OP's friend\\* Get the fuck outta here before I call the cops on you.\n\nOP's friend(to OP): Look how disrespecful (f buddy's name)'s wife is to me.\n\nOP: Yeah, I don't blame her for telling her husband's f buddy to leave.\n\nOP's friend: \\*Surprised Pikachu Face\"", "NTA.\n\nShe has every right to mourn him but nobody is entitled to use their grief to worsen that of other people who were closer to the loss.\n\nShe needs to Google 'circles of grief' and work on putting her grief outwards to her friends, not inwards to his family.", "A true no win situation.", "\ud83d\udc80 i had to read that twice..", "Yeah my husband had to wait 2 years by law to obtain a divorce. Meanwhile we are in the hospital trying to explain why his next of kin is his wife to whom he is married but has not laid eyes on since the separation. I came well after the separation but boy did I receive a lot of side eye from the nurses for being \u201ca mistress\u201d.", "how can feelings be illegitimate?", "Letting the friendship die is for the best if she won't listen. \nAnd you might never get her to listen.\nOne she thought she had a place at the funeral, while the family was grieving. That's not okay, and she ignored being told so.\n2. She leaves stuff by a grave where the widow  children etc comes and still won't listen how this is most likely hurting them and their family. \n\nShe won't change. She needs some greive therapy. Mourn him in her own home. Have a little shrine if she wants. But don't go to his actual grave. \nWhat would she do if she ran into his widow and children by the grave? Say \"oh let's grieve together. I'm the former mistress! Oh, how I loved him\"", ">The company you keep speaks volumes on who you are. Period. Her morals appear quite questionable that she stays friends knowing what a shitty person her friend is. Any potential partners should take that as a red flag.\n\nGreat, so you agreethat if anyone you know is a criminal you are one too.\nOtherwise why would you hang out with them? \n\n\n>Her morals appear quite questionable that she stays friends knowing what a shitty person her friend is.\n\nLol.no, most people tend to stick by friends who have done horrible shit, not to condone it but because they ARE friends and the entire point is to help each other learn and grow.\n\nOne can condemn shit and tell their friends they're morons without being the same as that person.\n\n>The company you keep speaks volumes on who you are. Period.\n\nIt literally doesn't. It speaks to how people will judge, but it has nothing innately to do with the individual or their values. \n\nAnd you do understand we've used that logic to justify killing civilians for fraternizing with hit targets right? After all, how can they be friends and know terrorists fairly well if not themselves a terrorist? \ud83d\ude44 \n\n\n>Any potential partners should take that as a red flag.\n\nLol the only red flag here is that you're willing to demonize people based on who they know not what they do or how they act.", "It isn't and I'm not saying OP can't be held accountable I'm just saying the relationships are complex and if this friend is like this  there are probably other things we don't know about that could be worse."]}
