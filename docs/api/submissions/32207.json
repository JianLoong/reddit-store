But I've had a csection, and food is my favorite part of the day.\n\n\n\nAin't nobody wanna see dat.", "If his partner is doing something that makes him uncomfortable it's his business. No matter how you guys try to paint this..it's weird to be doing those poses naked in front of your family. And he took her aside to let her know. He didn't try to embarrass her. It was all respectful.", "Nobody has demanded anything in this story.", "It's an over exaggerated point to show how people in fact can't do what they like when in a relationship without consequences. Just because it's her home doesn't mean she gets to do whatever she likes regardless of how her partner feels about it if she wants the relationship to continue.", "That's what the OP did, although given her reaction (suggesting he was judging her family), I'm guessing he basically just said or implied that her family was weird for not having an issue with it.\n\nIt's one thing to say that \"_____ makes me feel uncomfortable.\" \n\nIt's another to say, \"______ is weird.\"\n\nOne is a judgment, the other is just a piece of a larger conversation.", "In one of the comments, OP states that the mom even sometimes makes positive comments about it.\n\nPlus, she apparently was upset that the OP was judging her and her family, implying the OP was suggesting the family shouldn't be okay with it.", "Dude, calm down. No one is getting sexualized. I take it you are American?", "Lol, see, I was on the fence about nude yoga, but you think its regrettable that there are nude changing rooms? \n\nAre you a never-nude wtf?", "Idk, being naked in a changing room is... Being naked in a changing room. Its what its for. Try to keep your eyes to yourself and if you don't want people seeing you then act accordingly. But yeah naked yoga with family is weird", "The scream I just scrumt!!!!", "He would join when she's getting into downward dog \ud83e\udd23", "Oh boy", "I had no idea what this was saying. I thought you were saying your mom once had to \u201cuse it real bad\u201d while she was in the bath and you were 6. Makes more sense after you explained it so I can read what happened differently.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be defensive, I was just confused. I wasn\u2019t trying to be rude.", "I think you missed a word in your original comment? You never mentioned using the toilet and confused the person who responded. Relax.", "Each their own, but that's definitely not something I'd be comfortable with. If I'm being honest, not with anyone other than my husband, really. But that's a me thing.", "Hot downward dog etc etc", "Sure, he was respectful in telling her how he feels. She decided she doesn't want to change. They're both allowed to do what they want. Nobody is requiring them to stay together. \n\nLike I said above, I wouldn't be compatible with her either. She's not required to be compatible with anybody", "Again, the two scenarios are not comparable at all, so the \u201cpoint\u201d you\u2019re attempting to make doesn\u2019t work.\n\nWe get it, you think nudity is inherently sexual\u2026 What a hot take!", "Well damn how does that not get mentioned in the beginning - like that\u2019s the entire thing", "Dude, you\u2019re trippin. We have animal brains that sexualize things when we least expect it.\n\nI\u2019m calm, you just don\u2019t have it in you to fully discuss this. Restating it\u2019s her parents is not a discussion.\n\nNow you seek to attack the speaker, a classical logical fallacy. Calm down, dude.", "Nobody was being defensive; like you the way you worded it I didn't know what you were asking \ud83d\ude44", "She missed a word... like 'minky'?\n\nYou thought she'd never seen any of her family members?\n\nNow I'm confused.", "So why are y'all hounding OP for saying what was on his mind?", "Doing positions in front of someone that basically entail showing off your crotch while naked...your *intention* might not be sexual, but something about the *action* still is.", "Yeah, they're using a wild logical fallacy and thinking it's a rhetorical point", "okay mr self proclaimed animal, i am done with you for tonight. Why don't you go sexualize a family member :)", "I literally asked \u201cwhat happened.\u201d\n\nThanks for explaining. Have a good one.", "Lol what? I was agreeing with the person I responded to. Then responded to someone who left me a comment. Wtf do you think \"hounding\" is? Bc it isn't this", "Perspective is a helluva drug! \ud83d\ude43", "\u201cMy gf puts the toilet paper roll on backwards even though she knows it bugs me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next, you going to let her get away with putting a knife in your back?\u201d\n\nThis is how that \u201cargument\u201d sounds \ud83e\udd23", "Lmfao as I\u2019ve clearly stated how wrong that is\u2026. You must come from a place where that\u2019s normal and accepted in the household! \nGoodnight buddy!", "Truly"]}
