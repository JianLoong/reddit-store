Or how the 50/50 is arranged, what those costs are, et cetera.\n\n>But there should be a court order as to the amount\n\nShould be? I (again) would disagree. I think parents having a good coparenting relationship and coming to agreements together is a far better option than going to court and fighting it out. That's the path for people who cannot communicate, agree or understand each other. Not what everyone should be aiming for. \n\n>It doesn\u2019t sound like he wants to have a child with his wife because he\u2019s putting all his money into his ex. \n\nHe has been asked to pay for the holiday, and agreed, but then decided not to after discussing it with his wife. Then the mum said she couldn't afford tuition fees on top of the household bills. It is subsidising his ex's half of his child's education, but it is still supporting his child. \n\n>All he should have to do Is pay the child support get a contract to what that monthly child support should be. Then he needs to concentrate on his current marriage.\n\nOof. So, you recommend being a bad parent?", "No, but he should be a husband. If his wife wants a baby she should be able to have one and if he cannot do that for her and she needs to go elsewhere. No one is saying he shouldn\u2019t support his child he should but also should also support his wife.\n\nSo at this point the kid is only five so they\u2019re gonna have to wait another 13 years even think about having a kid. That\u2019s not fair to her. If she wants a child she needs to move on because he isn\u2019t going to allow it until he decides it is \u201cthe right \u201c time\n\nShe should\u2019ve went with her first thought about not dating someone with kids especially someone who has an ex that expects him to subsidize her lifestyle also. Again he most definitely needs to support his child but he needs to get a child support court order. He puts his ex above OP.\n\nOP you really need to consider this relationship you will never be a priority and if you want a child you\u2019re gonna have to find someone who wants a family with you.", ">So if this point the kid is only five so they\u2019re gonna have to wait another 13 years even think about having a kid. \n\nThat's an extreme reading of the situation. An inability to afford a second kid right now is not the same as saying \"I can only have one dependant at a time\". \n\nAlso, the ability to immediately reproduce is not the only thing that makes someone a worthwhile partner.", "She wants a child. So she should give up her dream of having a child with him. She should just move on to someone who wants a family with her. Even waiting 13 years won\u2019t end support of ex. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is she needs to be with someone who makes her a priority.l and wants a family with her.", ">She wants a child. So she should give up her dream of having a child with him. \n\nAgain, not right now doesn't mean never.\n\nIt is very clear that you are in the \"no dating single parents\" club. Your weak arguments are dripping with judgement. Bad situation with an ex? Your parents? \n\nYour inability to just make a reasoned argument, and instead sticking with these extreme takes (like waiting 13 years) ruins any points you might have. \n\n>All I\u2019m saying is she needs to be with someone who makes her a priority.\n\nWanting to be able to financially support her and his next child *is* making her a priority. \n\nShe cannot be his only priority. And she knew that when she married him.", "Exactly that is why she needs to move on. Women unfortunately only have a window of child bearing years. She could just have a kid and get support legally from him. But it would be better to find someone else. \n\nThis will never go away. She is not his priority. She wants to start a family he doesn\u2019t. His other family comes first and not just the child. It will never end. She needs to understand this. \n\nSo if she wants a family she will need to find someone who is on the same page. Most people are never financially ready to have kids but make it through. Why should she give up her wants for his other family?  In the end she should have gone with her gut. It is not too late to find a partner who want a family with her"]}
