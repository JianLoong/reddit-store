Or how the 50/50 is arranged, what those costs are, et cetera.\n\n>But there should be a court order as to the amount\n\nShould be? I (again) would disagree. I think parents having a good coparenting relationship and coming to agreements together is a far better option than going to court and fighting it out. That's the path for people who cannot communicate, agree or understand each other. Not what everyone should be aiming for. \n\n>It doesn\u2019t sound like he wants to have a child with his wife because he\u2019s putting all his money into his ex. \n\nHe has been asked to pay for the holiday, and agreed, but then decided not to after discussing it with his wife.

If she's struggling financially, she needs to take responsibility and cut down on frivolous expenses, you know, like vacations.", "If she\u2019s struggling financially, she shouldn\u2019t be going on two week vacations.", "But much like the rest of the world, she can\u2019t rely on her ex partner to foot the bills\u2026", "i 100% get what you mean. but\u2026 she went on a vacation? she CHOSE to go on a vacation she clearly (supposedly) can\u2019t afford. it sounds more like she wants to wreck his marriage", "I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve had to postpone a couple multiple day vacations because I worried about finances. You would think if she was struggling like the rest of the world, she would postpone the vacation and use that money for necessities. That\u2019s just me though.", "Maybe if she\u2019s struggling she should not take vacations or send her kid to private school.", "[deleted]", "I just find it a little bizarre that he doesn't see how wide open he's leaving himself without an actual agreement in place...", "So if he gets a court order for support he has to go thru discovery which means all his finances come out. He may not want YOU to actually know how much money he brings in. He may not be paying her as much as he would if he went to court. You don\u2019t know. He has his reasons. \n\n Second thing. You\u2019re posting here because you\u2019re pissed you\u2019re putting starting a family on hold because of the ex. He said you can\u2019t start trying for a baby because his finances are stretched thin now. The baby thing may not actually be about the ex asking for all this cash. He may not be wanting to try to start a family with you right now. All the money stuff might be a nice distracting explanation.", "Thanks for pointing that out! That\u2019s exactly what it is, projection.", "How is me saying I experience neglect as a child because my mother used it as punishment against my dad equal me being a bitter mother?\n\nDid you miss the edit where i experienced this as a child, an edit that I made about 10 minutes before your comment? Or are you the OP on a different account, who didn\u2019t read the edit and assumed it was the same comment??\n\nMy mother neglected her children, me and my siblings to punish my dad if she didn\u2019t get what she wanted (mostly money). So the best solution was for my dad to get full custody which he did.", "Because this is the start, she\u2019s already threatening not to pay her half of the household which I\u2019m sure will include food, and she\u2019s not paying tuition, which her daughter needs. \n\nShe will deny her child things (essential or luxuries) to get the money, to prove her point that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have money\u201d.\n\nYour husband will not want his child to going out without essentials. So how do you propose he stands his ground, when it looks like his child will go without if he doesn\u2019t help? \n\nMaybe you can\u2019t see it yet, but she will get worse, and she will blame dad for it, and try to isolate her child from dad too. When you finally see it, I hope you will consider taking her full custody.\n\nYou could offer to her you\u2019re willing to take full custody if she\u2019s struggling so much, and maybe she will think twice about playing these games. But you and him should probably talk to a family court lawyer first to make sure he has protection on his custody time in place before saying anything.", "I've got a 100k job and still can't afford a 2 week vacation with kids. Eating meals out alone for that long is a fortune.", "Right?", "The mom\u2019s side of the family along with the mom\u2019s friends.", "That\u2019s what I thought as well, sooooo open to anything", "> Should be? I (again) would disagree. I think parents having a good coparenting relationship and coming to agreements together is a far better option than going to court and fighting it out.\n\nThe ex is trying to financially abuse the husband through their child. It's crossed a line from a nice to have to necessity at this point, how long do you think the husband and OP should tolerate this behaviour?", "[deleted]", "I think that's a bit of a stretch based on the information given here. I have a lot more questions that would need to be answered before I could call this financial abuse.", "Because the trip wasn\u2019t about family. The trip was vacation then she visited friends and family on the way. Even if it was just to visit her family, that trip should be you expense and your expense only. When we take in vacation and visit his family and my family and other people that our expense only.", "What OP is saying is,  OP's Husband's Ex can afford to that these type of vacations but can no longer afford her half of their daughter's tuition and expect him to help her with her (Ex's) household expenses.", "[deleted]", "But it's not just about OP's husband paying for daughter's vacation, now OP's ex wants him to fully cover their daughter's tuition and also wanting him to cover her (Ex's) household expenses.", "Ok great point but to what end? He\u2019s expected to pay for the trips to see her family and she\u2019s never expected to pay for trips to see his family? From my pov it makes sense for everyone to pay for their own trips they take internationally with her if it\u2019s to see family or a beach vacation. I think international trips should be paid for by both parents if it\u2019s a school trip or for educational purposes. Might be an unpopular opinion but that seems fair. Otherwise you\u2019ll always have 1 parent paying for all trips and then the lines get blurred\u2026what if she then decided to go to Italy for a month with her sister and wants to bring her daughter is that a trip to see family when you\u2019re seeing 1 aunt and touring Europe ?"]}
