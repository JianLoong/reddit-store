Or how the 50/50 is arranged, what those costs are, et cetera.\n\n>But there should be a court order as to the amount\n\nShould be? I (again) would disagree. I think parents having a good coparenting relationship and coming to agreements together is a far better option than going to court and fighting it out. That's the path for people who cannot communicate, agree or understand each other. Not what everyone should be aiming for. \n\n>It doesn\u2019t sound like he wants to have a child with his wife because he\u2019s putting all his money into his ex. \n\nHe has been asked to pay for the holiday, and agreed, but then decided not to after discussing it with his wife.
