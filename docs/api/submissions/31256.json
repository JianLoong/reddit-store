When we asked them to bring a dish, they would bring the easiest thing - a case of beer, a store-bought pie, or instant mashed potatoes.

Holy shit are they entitled and taking you for granted. Just tell them you aren't doing thanksgiving anymore. Don't give details; The less detail the better. If they get upset about it, too bad for them. Enjoy a thanksgiving that makes YOU happy and thankful. They can figure out another plan for themselves, it's not your problem. I'm sure they will try to blame/guilt/manipulate you, and if that happens, then that's a good time to take a break from talking to them.  And hey, maybe this thanksgiving you change things up, go out to eat, take a trip somewhere (nearby even), or just do something *different* so it doesn't bring up any of those stressful feelings you've had in years passed. \n\n\nI say this as someone who has experienced similar. My mom and I are primarily responsible for thanksgiving dinner. We have asked members of my dad's family to bring dishes. Someone volunteered green bean casserole and showed up with 2 cans of green beans (for 40 people). Another brought a single can of creamed corn. My half sibling who *volunteered* to bring homemade pumpkin pie, enough for 50 people (we double checked she was okay with that) came with 2 very small store brand pumpkin pies, enough to feed *mayyyyybeeee* 20 people. That was the last year we had thanksgiving with them.", "NTA and if your dad feels obligated to host at his house, that doesn't mean you have to cook. Let him cook for the freeloaders.", " NTA\n\nIf they can\u2019t contribute, help cook, clean or anything else  that can alleviate work for you than they don\u2019t need to be there. \nThey\u2019re taking advantage and they know it.\nSomeone else can host or they can all start helping.\n\nNext time they say something you should be absolutely clear of what you would expect from them.", "NTA. They are just taking advantage of you. You are right to lock your doors. As for following traditions and aligning to culture, the deal is that you align to the good parts and discard the rest. Modern people are not obligated to work themselves into the ground to follow some old culture or to host some unappreciative relatives. They can go pound some cake and have that for the Holidays.", "\u201cIf you show up uninvited, you\u2019re trespassing. You don\u2019t have the right to just show up because we\u2019re family. That\u2019s simply entitled, not to mention criminal.\u201d (Criminal because they\u2019re trespassing.)\n\nThen when they continue to be angry, I\u2019d add: \u201cYou do realize that you\u2019re angry because I\u2019m unwilling to allow you to be rude and disrespectful, right?\u201d\n\nThe point is that they need to be called out for their shitty, entitled behavior. \n\nNTA. And stop hosting now.", "NTA. You're not their servant and the fact that they scoffed at you for asking for help and financial contributions means you need to not cook for them again.\n\nIf they show up, you already told them you're not going to answer the door so don't.", "NTA. I noticed that your family *told* you that they would show up instead of *asking* you, nor do they seem to show much appreciation for all the work you do for the meal other than showing up to eat and taking the leftovers. And it's obvious your frustration at doing so much work has been building for quite a while. Bluntly - it sounds like all the work has made you dread Thanksgiving as opposed to it being an enjoyable holiday.\n\nThe idea that you are the one obligated to host Thanksgiving dinner is your father's, not yours, and you are not bound by his feelings. After all, you are not the oldest sibling (in his generation).", "NTA this made me angry for you.", "NTA. Yikes, so they don't even bother to pitch in some money for all of the costs, help with cleaning up, contribute food to this apparent weekend stay, or take you and your family out and pay for it as thanks? Talk about ungrateful. Your parents are allowed to do whatever they want, but you can refuse to do alllllllll of the cooking if you wanted, and refuse to do it as you mentioned when you are older and have a house / family of your own, or you can set the precedent that when you are officially hosting you will only host if family members contribute to the cost.  \n\nMy bf and I are hosting his family, and they have offered to both contribute dessert and some thing, and contribute money to cover the other food items (since we are 3, and they are 6). My cousin and his wife are hosting for the first time, and are requesting that guests bring food (like sides and such) and I believe are kind of assigning them, because hosting is expensive AND a lot of work.", "NTA. It's unfair for you to bear the burden of hosting and cooking for such a large family every year, especially when others don't contribute much. You've made it clear that you need a break, and it's important for your family to understand and respect your boundaries. Enjoy a stress-free Thanksgiving!", "NTA tell them you are ordering pizza this year for Thanksgiving because it is only you \u201cgiving\u201d and a \u201cthanks\u201d without any help doesn\u2019t cut it.", "NTA, although tactically it may have been wise to hold of on the \"at my house ... \" declarations until you actually have your own house.", "NTA. I could kind of see both sides until I got to splitting leftovers evenly. You buy the food, cook it, and they act entitled to take the extra food home? No. I'd go spend Thanksgiving in a cabin where they can't find you.", "NTA- they are users and abusers. Count yourself lucky for removing these blood sucking ticks from your life. Maybe someday soon your dad will grow a spine and follow your lead.", "Take a vacation day & go to a good resturant for Thanksgiving !  Oop's sorry not home !", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
