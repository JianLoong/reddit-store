Holy shit are they entitled and taking you for granted. Just tell them you aren't doing thanksgiving anymore. Don't give details; The less detail the better. If they get upset about it, too bad for them. Enjoy a thanksgiving that makes YOU happy and thankful. They can figure out another plan for themselves, it's not your problem. I'm sure they will try to blame/guilt/manipulate you, and if that happens, then that's a good time to take a break from talking to them.  And hey, maybe this thanksgiving you change things up, go out to eat, take a trip somewhere (nearby even), or just do something *different* so it doesn't bring up any of those stressful feelings you've had in years passed. \n\n\nI say this as someone who has experienced similar. My mom and I are primarily responsible for thanksgiving dinner. We have asked members of my dad's family to bring dishes. Someone volunteered green bean casserole and showed up with 2 cans of green beans (for 40 people). Another brought a single can of creamed corn. My half sibling who *volunteered* to bring homemade pumpkin pie, enough for 50 people (we double checked she was okay with that) came with 2 very small store brand pumpkin pies, enough to feed *mayyyyybeeee* 20 people.

I noticed that your family *told* you that they would show up instead of *asking* you, nor do they seem to show much appreciation for all the work you do for the meal other than showing up to eat and taking the leftovers. And it's obvious your frustration at doing so much work has been building for quite a while. Bluntly - it sounds like all the work has made you dread Thanksgiving as opposed to it being an enjoyable holiday.\n\nThe idea that you are the one obligated to host Thanksgiving dinner is your father's, not yours, and you are not bound by his feelings.

Yikes, so they don't even bother to pitch in some money for all of the costs, help with cleaning up, contribute food to this apparent weekend stay, or take you and your family out and pay for it as thanks?

My cousin and his wife are hosting for the first time, and are requesting that guests bring food (like sides and such) and I believe are kind of assigning them, because hosting is expensive AND a lot of work.", "NTA.

Hell one set of aunt/uncles just shows up each year with cans of greenbeans, cream soup and fried onions and uses my dishes/kitchen to whip up green bean casserole.
