{"id": 4524, "submission_id": "zjog8v", "title": "AITA for scamming my cousins out of their inheritance?", "selftext": "Those are my cousins\u2019 words, not mine. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong.\n\nYears ago our grandfather passed. In his will, he left our family\u2019s traditional homestead to me and my cousins. This homestead has over 100 acres and is about 90 mins from a very large city. We all had equal shares of the homestead so my cousins wanted to sell it and take the cash. I didn\u2019t.\n\nThe homestead has sentimental values to me and tbh, is quite beautiful. There\u2019s a large pond on it that is fed by a spring and several forest patches randomly throughout the land. I spent some of my best years and some of my most precious memories were made on this land. The best part was that the land was given an agricultural tax designation so the yearly property tax was very low. I also wanted to keep it because I thought it would increase in value due to its location.\n\nBack then several out-of-state companies were talking about moving to our state. In addition, the cities in the area was trying to turn the surrounding areas into Silicon Valley 2 so they were courting tech businesses with tax breaks. I thought the land was going to be in a prime location if any of that comes to pass. \n\nI want to make it clear that none of the businesses moved to our city at point and they didn\u2019t even said they were moving to our state. In fact, our state was one of many on their lists. I didn\u2019t have any inside information and everything I knew was based on the public news available to everyone. I didn\u2019t bring it up to the cousins during our talks. To make a long story short, I bought out their shares at market value. Everything was done legally and everyone was happy at the time.\n\nI held on to the homestead through good times and bad times. I held on to it through many offers from many developers. After about a decade, companies started to move to our state and many to the areas where I predicted they would. My land\u2019s value has soared and developers call me daily with some even visiting in person weekly.\n\nWhile I plan to keep the bulk of the land and am living in the house my great grandfather built, I recently sold 2 acres for 100x the price I paid my cousins for the entire land. When they found out, crap hit the fan. The family exploded and they are screaming I cheated them out of their inheritance. I pointed out it took a decade for anything to happen so it was the very definition of a gamble and I just happen to come out on top. They argue that I should have told them that this could have happened and I argued I made my decision on publicly available information.\n\nMany in the family want me to update their shares but I refuse. I view it as a business gamble I won.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m going to answer some questions asked.\n\n1. At the time I was the youngest of the cousins. I was a senior in college while the others were between their mid 20s to late 30s.\n2. At the time I was pursuing my finance degree. Some of the cousins didn\u2019t attend college while others had degrees.\n4. Our grandfather had kids and he left them money, other properties, and stakes in his business. He left the grandkids the homestead because we all spent our summers there riding horses, fishing, camping, etc.\n3. Had I refused to sell, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to sell. However it never got to that point. When they told me they wanted to sell, I asked for a week to think about it. When the week was up, I came back and told them I would buy their shares. We got the property appraised and we all agreed on the appraised price.\n4. I sold everything I had including my car. I borrowed the rest from my parents. They loaned me the money without interest so as long as I keep the house. That wasn\u2019t a problem since I love that place.", "created_utc": 1670822812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjog8v/aita_for_scamming_my_cousins_out_of_their/", "score": 2276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their fault for not doing any due diligence", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry but how was this a scam in any way? \n\nThey wanted cash and you wanted the land at the time and you gave them what they wanted.

Property does tend to increase in value and they chose to take the money 'now' rather than see their inheritance as a long term investment. You're fine but could cut them a 'tip' as goodwill to get over it and move on.", "NTA.  Everybody knows that land values are increasing.  They just wanted instant gratification instead of letting the property sit.  They harassed you to sell and you finally bought their shares.  They made a poor business decision; that\u2019s on them.", "NTA and congratulations you made a great investment and you also get to enjoy the beauty and the memories", "NTA  \n \n\nBefore you sell anything, you evaluate it for this reason.

NTA at all. It\u2019s their own faults they wanted money then instead of waiting.", "NTA - Everyone in this situation was a grown ass adult and capable of doing their own research. It is not your fault that whatever reasons they had for choosing to sell meant that they lost out on money a decade later.", "Before I read the end I thought of the exact same words that you won.

They're just mad they didn't do what you did to invest in the land for the last decade.

It's easy to now make the claim that you had the knowledge it would sell for much higher, but realistically that was never a guarantee. I know a lot of people might disagree, but if your family comes after you for something like this then they aren't worth keeping around anyway. Would it absolutely kill me to be on their side of it? Yes. Would I blame anyone but myself? Nope", "NTA. That is their problem that they didn\u2019t think about the future.

I would have done the same thing if I had the funds when my grandfather died.", "NTA. They were perfectly happy to sell at the previous price. \u201cSellers remorse\u201d 10 years later is NOT your problem. What if they had sold it to someone else, would they be saying the same thing? No, because they would have no case.", "NTA. The only reason they are doing this is because you are family.  If you had all sold to a third party, they wouldn't be going to that buyer asking for more.     They wanted to sell. You paid fair market price.  Because they now see a lot of money just out of reach, they are crying foul.

It was family. Unless his family have always been evil to him.\n\n Chances are had he said btw this might happen, but is a gamble, they would have still sold. And he would be free of any blame. But he didn't. And no land near me has ever increased by so much in a short period of time..Say he paid $50k to buy, he has $5m now. And still has 98% of land left. So would stand to make $250m. And that's a Conservative guess, he probably paid more to start with.", "Maybe. But if the land ended up being worth less today, would the cousins be AH for not convincing him to sell when they did? No. I think the same reasoning has to apply. They\u2019re all adults, and they made their choices. They have to live with them.", "By OPs own admission multiple companies were looking to move. So it was never going to be the \"gamble\" made out to be. And as you said land always increases, so would not be worth less, so even if it was a gamble and noone moved there, they would just be in same or slightly better position.

They sold their shares a decade ago. They do not have the tiniest little leg to stand on here.\n\nI know some other commenters have suggested giving them a bit out of kindness/ for relations. For me, when people decide to aggressively accuse me of ill intent, I'm not so inclined to give them anything. Plus, you would almost have to take further legal action to prevent them from trying to use any generosity from you as proof that they should get 'their full share of their inheritance'.

To recoup some of their expenses, they would rent out the property to vacationers when they weren't using it. \n\nWell, the other grandkids caught wind of this and wanted to use the cottage too. So, the owner directed them to the rental website and said he'd give them a 20% discount on rates in-season and 40% off rates in the off season.

You are not to blame for their decisions. Their misplaced sense of entitlement isn\u2019t your problem.", "NTA, but you need to stop sharing anything but superficial information with your extended family. They are salty because they didn't invest like you did.", "NTA", "NTA - they sold their land at market value.  Those 2 acres you sold will probably continue to appreciate, and in 10 more years, will be worth more than you sold them for - and you will not be entitled to any of that money, because YOU sold it for market value.  \n\nIt is common knowledge that land generally goes up in value, that investors to not by things that they do not expect to increase in value, and that one you sell something - that is the end of you claim to it.\n\nYou did not take advantage of them, and they are not entitled to any of it - if you weren't family, that would be obvious to everyone in your family. You INVESTED, it paid off - if anyone gives you a hard time about that, cut them off - and don't \"update their shares\" (I'd never even heard of this), or it will never stop - and defeats the point of investing in the first place (and is overlooking the taxes you paid, the legal fees you incurred (and time spent) when people made offers to you, the payments you made, etc.", "NTA In any way. You carried all of the risk for that land for a decade. \n\nIf for some reason you feel the need to share the money with family, set up a uni/trade school scholarship fund for their kids. If their kids get good grades, and/or meet other criteria you set, you pay for part of their uni costs. The family can indirectly benefit from the sale of grandpa\u2019s land, and you are not seen as a cash cow.", "NTA \nIf they sold stock in a company to you and that stock ended up doing really well they wouldn\u2019t be entitled to anything as they sold it to you. Not to mention you had to pay taxes and upkeep on the house.", "NTA.  Your jealous and greedy cousins can pound sand.  You\u2019re my hero.", "NTA\n\nYou gave them exactly what they wanted and now they have regrets. that\u2019s on them", "NTA.\n\nWhat you did was just take both the sentimental and long view.\n\nI might toss some money at the cousins just to keep peace in the family -- like contributions to their kids college funds, but you have no obligation to listen to their whining.", "For real\u2026..NTA", "I read your edits, and honestly, if you owe anything to anyone, it is to your parents for helping you buy out our cousins with an interest-free loan.

You sold everything you owned to buy the land after getting an appraisal that everyone thought was fair, and the whole sale happened because they wanted to sell not because you wanted to buy.  You owe them nothing.", "Do not follow this advice OP. It\u2019ll be seen as an admission of guilt and support their sellers remorse and greed.", "OP, I agree with all of this except the tipping. I'd think that might bring legal issues. Don't give them a penny. Gambles are gambles for a reason.", "A tip as goodwill? That would set a ridiculous precedent. \n\nWhat if OP wants to sell additional land in the future? They just keep getting handouts? \n\nThey made a business deal. They had the same opportunity to hold onto the land as OP, but chose to cut and run. \n\nIt's on them. They deserve no additional benefit.", "I bet your one of the cousins lol OP DO NOT TIP!!", "Exactly. They\u2019re only mad because they\u2019re on the non-moneyed end of the equation.

It is opening OP to acknowledgement that their claims of insider knowledge, aka fraud, has some validity to it even when none existed.
