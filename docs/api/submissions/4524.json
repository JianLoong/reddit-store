{"id": 4524, "submission_id": "zjog8v", "title": "AITA for scamming my cousins out of their inheritance?", "selftext": "Those are my cousins\u2019 words, not mine. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong.\n\nYears ago our grandfather passed. In his will, he left our family\u2019s traditional homestead to me and my cousins. This homestead has over 100 acres and is about 90 mins from a very large city. We all had equal shares of the homestead so my cousins wanted to sell it and take the cash. I didn\u2019t.\n\nThe homestead has sentimental values to me and tbh, is quite beautiful. There\u2019s a large pond on it that is fed by a spring and several forest patches randomly throughout the land. I spent some of my best years and some of my most precious memories were made on this land. The best part was that the land was given an agricultural tax designation so the yearly property tax was very low. I also wanted to keep it because I thought it would increase in value due to its location.\n\nBack then several out-of-state companies were talking about moving to our state. In addition, the cities in the area was trying to turn the surrounding areas into Silicon Valley 2 so they were courting tech businesses with tax breaks. I thought the land was going to be in a prime location if any of that comes to pass. \n\nI want to make it clear that none of the businesses moved to our city at point and they didn\u2019t even said they were moving to our state. In fact, our state was one of many on their lists. I didn\u2019t have any inside information and everything I knew was based on the public news available to everyone. I didn\u2019t bring it up to the cousins during our talks. To make a long story short, I bought out their shares at market value. Everything was done legally and everyone was happy at the time.\n\nI held on to the homestead through good times and bad times. I held on to it through many offers from many developers. After about a decade, companies started to move to our state and many to the areas where I predicted they would. My land\u2019s value has soared and developers call me daily with some even visiting in person weekly.\n\nWhile I plan to keep the bulk of the land and am living in the house my great grandfather built, I recently sold 2 acres for 100x the price I paid my cousins for the entire land. When they found out, crap hit the fan. The family exploded and they are screaming I cheated them out of their inheritance. I pointed out it took a decade for anything to happen so it was the very definition of a gamble and I just happen to come out on top. They argue that I should have told them that this could have happened and I argued I made my decision on publicly available information.\n\nMany in the family want me to update their shares but I refuse. I view it as a business gamble I won.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m going to answer some questions asked.\n\n1. At the time I was the youngest of the cousins. I was a senior in college while the others were between their mid 20s to late 30s.\n2. At the time I was pursuing my finance degree. Some of the cousins didn\u2019t attend college while others had degrees.\n4. Our grandfather had kids and he left them money, other properties, and stakes in his business. He left the grandkids the homestead because we all spent our summers there riding horses, fishing, camping, etc.\n3. Had I refused to sell, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to sell. However it never got to that point. When they told me they wanted to sell, I asked for a week to think about it. When the week was up, I came back and told them I would buy their shares. We got the property appraised and we all agreed on the appraised price.\n4. I sold everything I had including my car. I borrowed the rest from my parents. They loaned me the money without interest so as long as I keep the house. That wasn\u2019t a problem since I love that place.", "created_utc": 1670822812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjog8v/aita_for_scamming_my_cousins_out_of_their/", "score": 4122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Property does tend to increase in value and they chose to take the money 'now' rather than see their inheritance as a long term investment. You're fine but could cut them a 'tip' as goodwill to get over it and move on.", "NTA.  Everybody knows that land values are increasing.  They just wanted instant gratification instead of letting the property sit.  They harassed you to sell and you finally bought their shares.  They made a poor business decision; that\u2019s on them.", "NTA and congratulations you made a great investment and you also get to enjoy the beauty and the memories", "NTA  \n \n\nBefore you sell anything, you evaluate it for this reason.

NTA at all. It\u2019s their own faults they wanted money then instead of waiting.", "NTA - Everyone in this situation was a grown ass adult and capable of doing their own research. It is not your fault that whatever reasons they had for choosing to sell meant that they lost out on money a decade later.", "Before I read the end I thought of the exact same words that you won.

They're just mad they didn't do what you did to invest in the land for the last decade.

It's easy to now make the claim that you had the knowledge it would sell for much higher, but realistically that was never a guarantee. I know a lot of people might disagree, but if your family comes after you for something like this then they aren't worth keeping around anyway. Would it absolutely kill me to be on their side of it? Yes. Would I blame anyone but myself? Nope", "NTA. That is their problem that they didn\u2019t think about the future.

I would have done the same thing if I had the funds when my grandfather died.", "NTA.

No, because they would have no case.", "NTA. The only reason they are doing this is because you are family.  If you had all sold to a third party, they wouldn't be going to that buyer asking for more.     They wanted to sell. You paid fair market price.  Because they now see a lot of money just out of reach, they are crying foul.

It was family. Unless his family have always been evil to him.\n\n Chances are had he said btw this might happen, but is a gamble, they would have still sold. And he would be free of any blame. But he didn't. And no land near me has ever increased by so much in a short period of time..Say he paid $50k to buy, he has $5m now. And still has 98% of land left. So would stand to make $250m. And that's a Conservative guess, he probably paid more to start with.", "Maybe. But if the land ended up being worth less today, would the cousins be AH for not convincing him to sell when they did? No. I think the same reasoning has to apply. They\u2019re all adults, and they made their choices. They have to live with them.", "By OPs own admission multiple companies were looking to move. So it was never going to be the \"gamble\" made out to be. And as you said land always increases, so would not be worth less, so even if it was a gamble and noone moved there, they would just be in same or slightly better position.

They sold their shares a decade ago. They do not have the tiniest little leg to stand on here.\n\nI know some other commenters have suggested giving them a bit out of kindness/ for relations. For me, when people decide to aggressively accuse me of ill intent, I'm not so inclined to give them anything. Plus, you would almost have to take further legal action to prevent them from trying to use any generosity from you as proof that they should get 'their full share of their inheritance'.

To recoup some of their expenses, they would rent out the property to vacationers when they weren't using it. \n\nWell, the other grandkids caught wind of this and wanted to use the cottage too. So, the owner directed them to the rental website and said he'd give them a 20% discount on rates in-season and 40% off rates in the off season.

That's how the world works: You buy something, and it goes up in value over time, especially property and houses. My sister bought her house for 130k ten years ago. Now? It's appraised at 500k. \n\nThey have seller's remorse, but that's not on you. They chose to make a decision based on impatience, and are now pitching a fit out of greed. Do NOT give them any money from the sale, or the argument could be made in court that since you paid them, even you agree they are entitled to a share.", "NTA the greed on their part is crazy. I get being butt hurt but you had the property for over a decade how did you steal from them. They have no led to stand on and I guess they showed their true colors", "NTA. \n\nThey are jealous because they were shortsighted and took quick cash instead of looking at future possibilities.\n\nThere problem not yours.\n\nStand firm.", "Nta", "NTA times 1000 and DO NOT compensate them in any way.  Consider engaging an attorney to determine how best to protect yourself and your prospective buyers.  For example the attorney may suggest a letter or something but don\u2019t go this alone.", "NTA, they're mad you were smarter. Don't give them a dime or they'll be up your butt every time they even think you're selling a foot of land.", "NTA. Not a scam. If people in their 20s and 30s who owned real estate were not aware that real estate has the potential to appreciate, that's on them. They got the fair value of their inheritance and should have invested that cash into other things that were likely to appreciate. Should OP get a cut of their investments' earnings? Of course not. That is not how sales work.", "If you had sold to a stranger, would they be hounding that person today?? No, they wouldn\u2019t. Just bc you bought the land doesn\u2019t mean they get updated payment. You weren\u2019t asking them for more money  during the years it depreciated or made no money, right?", "ESH\n\nYour cousins wanted to sell, so assuming that an outside developer's interest didn't make them reconsider the future business potential (a big assumption, frankly), it ultimately doesn't matter from a financial perspective whether they sold to you or some random stranger.\n\nHowever, there is a difference from an emotional perspective. You specifically said you thought this was a possibility and didn't bring it up at all in conversation with them. That definitely makes it look like you were trying to pull something over on them. There's a difference between presenting it as \"This land is sentimental to me\" rather than \"This land is sentimental, *but* I also think it will be massively more valuable in a few years anyway.\" It's sleazy.\n\nUltimately, they should have enough sense to say, \"Congratulations\" and move on with their lives, and they suck for trying to pressure you into changing the deal now. But you really shouldn't be surprised that your family feels exploited. The question you asked is, \"Am I the asshole?\" And yeah, if you told me this story in real life, I'd walk away thinking you're an asshole who saw a way to make money and doesn't care that it was ultimately at his family's expense.", "You bought their shares so they've got no claim. It wasn't a scam. You are just financially smarter than them. NTA", "Simply put, do not tell them anything more of your financial situation.  Full stop.\n\nTell them the land was sold 10 years ago and you will not discuss it further. \n\nIf they persist. Say \" I appreciate your opinion, however false it may be. This conversation is over. \" and hang up, put your phone a silent, mark conversations as read to clear your phone and go low contact for a month. \n\nRinse wash repeat.\n\nThat is the best part of tech. Just hang up.", "NTA- Congratulations! They blew it, not your problem.", "NTA. Like you said, you invested, they sold their shares, and now they're mad because it blew up. That's like the guy who doesn't join the office lottery, but gets upset when they win and don't share the money with him.", "NTA at all. Don\u2019t give them a penny. You took a calculated risk and it paid off.", "NTA. Plain as day. Your cousins wanted out, with a pocket full of money. You were looking more long term. Sold everything you had, at a relatively young age, to keep the farm you loved. They had their money, you had grandpa\u2019s farm . Everybody is happy. Until the value of the property increased significantly, as properties often do. You didn\u2019t scam anyone. They could have enjoyed staying at the old homestead for vacations, but the cousins wanted the money, and they got their share.  You bought the farm property. You own it. You\u2019ve owned it for ten years or so. They got the money, as they should, for their share. The End.", "Lol NTA! They seemed like they wanted out and you gave them a fair share that they\u2019ve been happy with all of this time. Would they be mad at anyone else they sold it to?", "NTA. They wanted their land sold and so they got their money. What would've happened if one of them took their money and invested it in a start up that then blew up. Update the shares for everyone?\nWhat if another one of these people bought another property and flipped it to make an even bigger net-gain then you?\n\nUpdate shares for everyone?\n\n\nWhat if yet another of these people did absolutely nothing with their share because they knew the others would be slobbering over any gains they'd make crying \"Update the shares for everyone!\"?", "NTA. It was a fair deal at the time. If they'd sold it to someone else, they'd still not have any more now than they got then.", "NTA, If they had sold to a Stanger they wouldn't be throwing a temper tantrum.", "NTA. They had access to all the info you did. And that info made it clear that there was only a chance many separate corporations would make the individual decisions  they did, which years later resulted in this land rush.\n\nIn your side was that you didn't need it to happen. Owning and protecting the land made you happy. You were not out for quick profits. They all were.", "NTA\n\nYou bought it fairly you owe them nothing", "Nta, they sold it for market value. The market changes often. If they sold it to strangers would they be asking for more money? No, they wouldn't even be thinking about it. You did nothing wrong. Don't give them anything and don't let them bully you", "You exclusively owned the property you sold? And windfall from the sale of the acreage is yours exclusively then. NTA. It really ain't that deep to me. You bought them out, so you owe them nothing.", "NTA. They were the classic kid who had to eat the cookie now rather than wait a little while in order to get two cookies. Screw them. Don't let them screw you.", "NTA", "NTA.  \n\nEveryone made their own decisions back then.  You have paid the taxes, insurance and upkeep for the home since buying their shares. They willingly sold their shares to you. It was all down legally and with appraisals. \n\nI would suggest talking to an estate planner of some sort - perhaps you want to put the home in a trust?  Make sure it's protected properly. \n\nYou do not owe them anything. They're just jealous you are now getting the benefits for keeping the home/land. \n\nI would stop telling them anything about your finances or selling bits of the land. While it may be public knowledge and they can continue to research that info moving forward, they've shown your their true colors....if you give an inch, they'll take a mile. \n\nYou live your life and enjoy that wonderful land and home you inherited.", "I love Bug's Life", "The \"tip\" being advice to do  their own research next time!", "The tip is a bad idea.\n\nNo amount will ever be enough. They will be unhappy if OP gives them everything, so no point giving them anything.\n\nThis is all rich guy problems anyway.", "Nope. They don\u2019t deserve it.", "Tipping them could mess with the original contract. Do not do this!", "They have had years to invest that money their own way. They chose not to.", "I doubt if they realize this considering the concept that property generally appreciates in value is alien to them. When you ask yourself why a college student would sell his car and borrow from parents to buy 100 acres of land and don\u2019t come up with the novel idea that perhaps he\u2019s speculating and planning to sell when the time is right, one is forced to rightfully conclude that there\u2019s not much going on upstairs.", "Yes! This!", "I'd send them all a nice framed picture of me driving a Lamborghini in Hawaii.", "And these folks have shown they don't pay a lot of attention to what's happening around them.", "NTA\n\nThis is not your problem at all.  They're trying to cash in on something you did.  You don't owe them anything.", "NTA:.\nGood job for keeping at least part of the family homestead together!! \nYour family are pretty pathetic.", "NTA. You were good to buy them out back then instead of just preventing the sale they wanted. You had no advantages over them when you decided to take a chance on keeping the land and seeing if it increased in value. They weren't children while you were an adult, and you didn't have insider knowledge, they just either needed money then or weren't long term thinkers.\n\nThey need a reality check from someone to remind them they wanted to sell and were happy to do so, and that a stranger will have benefitedfro the value increase if you'd sold wihh them. You didn't initiate the idea they should sell or manipulate the issue in any way. Is there a family member who can talk sense into them?", "NTA and it wasn't a scam. You bought the property for a fair price ten years ago. Let them shout and complain.  They have no legal or moral grounds to object to what you do with it.", "NTA\n\nSour grapes. That was ten years ago. Ten years that you've paid property taxes and taken care of the land and the house. That's a big gamble for an estimate of future developments. A gamble that your relatives did not take. You owe them nothing. \n\nIf you had all sold the property in the beginning, they might be crying about lost money now, but they sure wouldn't be going to the guy who bought the property and claiming he scammed them. They're only doing that now because you're family and they feel like they can get away with it or that you owe them, for \"some reason.\"", "NTA. Well done.", "NTA - You took the risk. You get the reward.", "You won - they lost out .\n\nThere shouldn't even be any problems , it should be congrats to you.", "You bought them out.", "Your cousins didn't want to hold onto the property. If they'd cared any one of them could've held onto their shares with you but they agreed on a price and sold out. You don't owe any of them squat. NTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe them anything, morally or legally.  Would they be saying they\u2019d been cheated if they\u2019d sold to a stranger?", "NTA. 1: They had access to the same information you had.\n\n2: they got marked value, you didn\u2019t get Any discount from them.\n\n3: they were all happy with the original deal.", "NTA. You fairly bought out their shares after having it appraised . They all agreed to the amount you paid them. Enjoy your property inheritance and with it as you want.", "NTA\n\nThey made the choice for instant gratification either without doing any minimal research to see what might possibly occur in the future or deciding they didn\u2019t want the risk associated with the maybe/possibly aspect.  Also they approached you to buy them out. \n\nRegardless the land was appraised and the fair market value determined at that point in time. \n\nYou put your own money and borrowed money from your folks to purchase the land. \n\nThen you hung onto it for at least 10 years where the value likely at times dropped below what you paid. \n\nSo now you are reaping the rewards for taking a decided risk and your cousins who of their own free will got the fair value for their shares at that time are absolutely butt hurt and screaming they were cheated and how you should \u2018do what\u2019s right and give them more money\u2019 because that is what FaMiLy does. \n\nNO repeated as many times as needed. \n\nI am quite confident if you had gone back to the cousins when the value dropped and told them they should give you back money based on the new lower value they\u2019d have told you so sad too bad you were the one who wanted the land so suck it up. \n\nYou owe them nothing. \n\nAnd going forward if you told someone about that sale who then shared with the family next time I would keep such info to yourself.", "Nta u my man is a businessman. U predict, wait, and win. Your cousins can do their own homework. Nta. Cut them out. U did nothing wrong. Your cousins were happy. If this land end up being worth $1, your cousins won\u2019t  pay u back market price right?!? Also, nxt time don\u2019t tell your cousins your dealings (though I\u2019m not sure if this is public info)", "NTA, and I don\u2019t like that you said you \u201cscammed them\u201d, because you really didn\u2019t. You made an educated decision, and they chose a different one.", "What if all of y'all sold it just 2 years ago to some random person? Would they go after them? No. They're just trying to get more money from you. Don't fall for it. If they continue to bitch, tell them to contact your lawyer", "Entitled vultures", "Right it's not even like this was a quick turn around where he had someone interested and didn't say anything, then immediately turned around and sold it for more than he bought them out for. I'd understand some level of anger if this was all in under a year or something.", "It happens. I have an uncle who scours the web for information like this. I guarantee that he knows exactly what I paid for my house, and I'm sure he's trying to figure out what I paid for the car I bought this spring. He's a deeply unpleasant, nosey man.", "And if the land was condemned or toxic somehow and became worthless and OP lost it would the cousins be volunteering to pay back the money they got to make up for OPs loss?    \nI somehow doubt it.....", ">I'm being Petty, Tom Petty.\n\nI love you! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I'm sure that uncle is also aware of developmental things like OP was."]}
