{"id": 4524, "submission_id": "zjog8v", "title": "AITA for scamming my cousins out of their inheritance?", "selftext": "Those are my cousins\u2019 words, not mine. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong.\n\nYears ago our grandfather passed. In his will, he left our family\u2019s traditional homestead to me and my cousins. This homestead has over 100 acres and is about 90 mins from a very large city. We all had equal shares of the homestead so my cousins wanted to sell it and take the cash. I didn\u2019t.\n\nThe homestead has sentimental values to me and tbh, is quite beautiful. There\u2019s a large pond on it that is fed by a spring and several forest patches randomly throughout the land. I spent some of my best years and some of my most precious memories were made on this land. The best part was that the land was given an agricultural tax designation so the yearly property tax was very low. I also wanted to keep it because I thought it would increase in value due to its location.\n\nBack then several out-of-state companies were talking about moving to our state. In addition, the cities in the area was trying to turn the surrounding areas into Silicon Valley 2 so they were courting tech businesses with tax breaks. I thought the land was going to be in a prime location if any of that comes to pass. \n\nI want to make it clear that none of the businesses moved to our city at point and they didn\u2019t even said they were moving to our state. In fact, our state was one of many on their lists. I didn\u2019t have any inside information and everything I knew was based on the public news available to everyone. I didn\u2019t bring it up to the cousins during our talks. To make a long story short, I bought out their shares at market value. Everything was done legally and everyone was happy at the time.\n\nI held on to the homestead through good times and bad times. I held on to it through many offers from many developers. After about a decade, companies started to move to our state and many to the areas where I predicted they would. My land\u2019s value has soared and developers call me daily with some even visiting in person weekly.\n\nWhile I plan to keep the bulk of the land and am living in the house my great grandfather built, I recently sold 2 acres for 100x the price I paid my cousins for the entire land. When they found out, crap hit the fan. The family exploded and they are screaming I cheated them out of their inheritance. I pointed out it took a decade for anything to happen so it was the very definition of a gamble and I just happen to come out on top. They argue that I should have told them that this could have happened and I argued I made my decision on publicly available information.\n\nMany in the family want me to update their shares but I refuse. I view it as a business gamble I won.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m going to answer some questions asked.\n\n1. At the time I was the youngest of the cousins. I was a senior in college while the others were between their mid 20s to late 30s.\n2. At the time I was pursuing my finance degree. Some of the cousins didn\u2019t attend college while others had degrees.\n4. Our grandfather had kids and he left them money, other properties, and stakes in his business. He left the grandkids the homestead because we all spent our summers there riding horses, fishing, camping, etc.\n3. Had I refused to sell, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to sell. However it never got to that point. When they told me they wanted to sell, I asked for a week to think about it. When the week was up, I came back and told them I would buy their shares. We got the property appraised and we all agreed on the appraised price.\n4. I sold everything I had including my car. I borrowed the rest from my parents. They loaned me the money without interest so as long as I keep the house. That wasn\u2019t a problem since I love that place.", "created_utc": 1670822812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjog8v/aita_for_scamming_my_cousins_out_of_their/", "score": 1531, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their fault for not doing any due diligence", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry but how was this a scam in any way? \n\nThey wanted cash and you wanted the land at the time and you gave them what they wanted.

Property does tend to increase in value and they chose to take the money 'now' rather than see their inheritance as a long term investment. You're fine but could cut them a 'tip' as goodwill to get over it and move on.", "NTA.  Everybody knows that land values are increasing.  They just wanted instant gratification instead of letting the property sit.  They harassed you to sell and you finally bought their shares.  They made a poor business decision; that\u2019s on them.", "NTA and congratulations you made a great investment and you also get to enjoy the beauty and the memories", "NTA  \n \n\nBefore you sell anything, you evaluate it for this reason.

NTA at all. It\u2019s their own faults they wanted money then instead of waiting.", "NTA - Everyone in this situation was a grown ass adult and capable of doing their own research. It is not your fault that whatever reasons they had for choosing to sell meant that they lost out on money a decade later.", "Before I read the end I thought of the exact same words that you won.

They're just mad they didn't do what you did to invest in the land for the last decade.

It's easy to now make the claim that you had the knowledge it would sell for much higher, but realistically that was never a guarantee. I know a lot of people might disagree, but if your family comes after you for something like this then they aren't worth keeping around anyway. Would it absolutely kill me to be on their side of it? Yes. Would I blame anyone but myself? Nope", "NTA. That is their problem that they didn\u2019t think about the future.

I would have done the same thing if I had the funds when my grandfather died.", "NTA.

No, because they would have no case.", "NTA. The only reason they are doing this is because you are family.  If you had all sold to a third party, they wouldn't be going to that buyer asking for more.     They wanted to sell. You paid fair market price.  Because they now see a lot of money just out of reach, they are crying foul.

It was family. Unless his family have always been evil to him.\n\n Chances are had he said btw this might happen, but is a gamble, they would have still sold. And he would be free of any blame. But he didn't. And no land near me has ever increased by so much in a short period of time..Say he paid $50k to buy, he has $5m now. And still has 98% of land left. So would stand to make $250m. And that's a Conservative guess, he probably paid more to start with.", "Maybe. But if the land ended up being worth less today, would the cousins be AH for not convincing him to sell when they did? No. I think the same reasoning has to apply. They\u2019re all adults, and they made their choices. They have to live with them.", "By OPs own admission multiple companies were looking to move. So it was never going to be the \"gamble\" made out to be. And as you said land always increases, so would not be worth less, so even if it was a gamble and noone moved there, they would just be in same or slightly better position.

They sold their shares a decade ago. They do not have the tiniest little leg to stand on here.\n\nI know some other commenters have suggested giving them a bit out of kindness/ for relations. For me, when people decide to aggressively accuse me of ill intent, I'm not so inclined to give them anything. Plus, you would almost have to take further legal action to prevent them from trying to use any generosity from you as proof that they should get 'their full share of their inheritance'.

To recoup some of their expenses, they would rent out the property to vacationers when they weren't using it. \n\nWell, the other grandkids caught wind of this and wanted to use the cottage too. So, the owner directed them to the rental website and said he'd give them a 20% discount on rates in-season and 40% off rates in the off season.

Your cousins did not have patience and wanted money immediately and you obliged.\n3. Your cousins are the assholes", "NTA you are right you took a gamble. Nothing was on the books nor did you have concrete information that you refused to share with your cousins (if you did then that is illegal). Having a hunch and refusing to disclose it as well as a 10 year wait for a pay off is proof no insider trading happened or anything shady that would make you an AH. They have no claims to the land anymore. Anything you give them is purely a gift at your behest.", "I mean no, but the average person does not know how LAN works in the pricing. Just because something is worth something today. A lot of people don't realize how much it will be worth in the future. I guess the best thing for you to do is break them off a little bit. I mean the average person isn't just looking into the future of land value like that.  And also, I feel like you should have told them about the public information. It seems like they weren't in the loop on that at all.", "NTA.  You didn't scam them; you did what was legally required.  They wanted the money \"NOW!\" and didn't want to wait for a better deal.\n\n>Had I refused to sell, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to sell.\n\nIn some places, they could have gone to court and forced the sale of the *entire* property it's called a \"partition sale.\"\n\nYou didn't scam them in any way.  Scamming them would have been buying their shares at *below* market value and telling them that was all that the land was worth.  You hired an appraiser to value the property and agreed with the price.\n\nYou don't owe them the difference in value.  If one of them threatens to sue, tell them to go ahead.  If they find a lawyer to take the case, the judge will toss it out.", "OP JUDGEMENT :: NTA\r  \n\r  \nyou won your business gamble. the rest of the fam is just pissed they didnt think to keep the land before.\r  \n\r  \nThey already got their shares, and you PAID for them. \r  \n\r  \nIt became your place.. not their.. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nYou do not owe them ANYTHING.    even if you give alittle now. . they will keep coming back and wanting more and more.", "Update the shares ? Lmfao if they sold there shares and was happy with they got at the time. To bad for them", "NTA! You took the risk, sold everything and borrowed. Cousins don't get to wind back time and correct their choice of behavior, that's not how life works! \"You pays your money and takes your chances\" - exactly what you did! Cousins are being opportunistic, greedy AHs themselves!", "NTA. You offered them market value and didn\u2019t undercut or give them a lowball offer. It sucks the land is worth more now but that\u2019s the gamble.", "Why should you gibe them.money?\n\nThey sell it to you\n\nIts their loss\n\nNTA", "Your cousins are just greedy fucks with regrets. Selling the house was their proposal and decision, you accommodated their desire to sell (which you didn't share at the time). \n\nYou have no financial obligation to them at all.", "NTA. Sucks for them, but that's real estate.", "NTA.  If you had all sold the house to a stranger 10 years ago would you all circle back NOW and ask for more money because the value of the property has increased?  Of course not.  Any logical person could figure that as time goes by there would most likely be a time period where the value would increase.  You owe them nothing.  You bought it fairly and there was nothing underhanded in the transaction.  They are being completely unreasonable and greedy.", "Nta.", "NTA. Had you agreed to sell, when your cousins wanted, would they have told the new owners that they want a share of the sale price? I think not.", "NTA.\n\n\nIf the property value had tanked they would have given a rats ass if you sold it then. \n\n\nJealous short sighted cousins. They sold their share, they can't reap what they don't own. Ignore them.", "You bought it from them.", "You didn't scam them in any way, that's for sure. They're AH for calling it that way and you owe them nothing.\n\nWhy didn't you bring it up during your talks though?\nIf you were close with your cousins at that time, you could have told them about your predictions and the gamble. Such advice is useful if you're in a field, to those who aren't.", "NTA. You did the research, you took the gamble. Had it been up to them, it would have been sold regardless of whom bought it.", "NTA. Your cousins sold you the land at fair market value at the time you bought it. Now you are doing the same. Did they scam you when they originally sold it? No. Your cousins decided to cash in on their inheritances immediately. Offer to sell their shares back to them at today's fair market value if they are really sore about their lack of foresight.", "Nta but man I would have handled it differently. I guess I view things from the point of view as a rising tide lifts all ships. You made such a killing on just two acres, why not share it? It\u2019s not just a place, it\u2019s also childhood memories and the bequest of your grandfather. What would your grandfather have wanted you to do, do you think?", "NTA. They wanted to sell, agreed to price, and you figured out how to purchase land. I wouldn\u2019t give them a penny more.", "Would they be giving money back to OP if OP lost money on property? Nope. They were paid and they got the market rate for the time. They wanted cash and got it. NTA", "It sounds like they were happy to let OP sell all of their possessions and take a loan to buy them out. NTA", "They did. It's like selling stock in 2008 and bitching that those who held on are selling for more.", "This is where I always go with these scenarios. They'd be scarce if OP took a bath on the property, for sure...", "Cousins wanted to sell the property.  If they had sold it to anyone outside the family, they wouldn't be getting a cut on anything now, 10 years later.   They shouldn't expect to get anything from OP.", "NTA and this is awful advise. Do NOT too then anything. If you do, they\u2019ll keep coming back for more.", "Fuck the tip, if they want any cash they can pay OP all of the money that was paid to keep the property maintained, the bills and the taxes for the past ten years first.", "I definitely would not do this - all you need is some smart aleck lawyer arguing that the payment is a concession from you that their argument has validity. It's BS of course but you're still going to get stuck in court for years over this.", "Sounds like my uncle. Left and cashed out of the family business *30 years ago*. Now thinks we\u2019re rolling in the dough (we\u2019re not) and believes he deserves money, asked me for 10k a few years ago", "Agree with you except for cutting them into it.  That will set a bad precedent for any time you want to sell a piece.  This is the equivalent of me selling my house for $100K. And then 10 years later, seeing it on the market for $500K.  I can\u2019t go back to the owners and scream fraud.  Nope.  Not the way it works.", "I also wonder how he sold his unwillingness to sell.  He obviously didn't tell them about his research and thoughts on potential land buyers, and if he gave them a sentimental argument how he couldn't bare to part with the land because of how much it meant I  would say he is an asshole.", "It was never a plan. It was a possibility and a risk based on easily available information. They wanted money in hand rather than a long term plan. If they had found toxic waste on the land instead should the cousins have paid OP back?", "That's a rather bizarre take on a pretty straightforward scenario.", "Yeah greed from his cousins who now regret their actions", "\ud83c\udfb6 I have a structured settlement but I need cash now\ud83c\udfb6", "100%", "Excellent posr", "wait ten years and tip them?", "And if OP had sold it along with the cousins, and then invested what he received and made a fortune then would they also be screaming?\n\nProbably - they are just shortsighted and greedy.  OP is NTA.", "This also means actively looking for it.", "Oh definitely don\u2019t do that!  Hey everyone, come to the dinner where I celebrate what you could have had!", "You're looking at this too reasonably.\n\n\n\n\nDo you know why Canada has laws explicitly stating that apologizing isn't an admission of guilt? Because people would apologize off handedly during road accidents and get screwed for admitting guilt.\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly OP has shown their hand; they knew the land could skyrocket in value, didn't tell anyone when dealing with the inheritance and they have a finance degree while some of the cousins don't even have an associates.\n\n\n\n\nNow OP could still get sued as in the US you can be practically sued for anything, still, a payment to make up the difference on a 2 acre sale 10 years later is exactly the type of thing a good attorney can exploit into getting a favorable judgment, especially as inheritance stuff is tricky even after years have passed as it's given special weight in how it has to be handled and transferred.", "They were all 10+ years older than him they should\u2019ve done their OWN research Op is under no obligation to help someone simply because they\u2019re family. His cousins wanted a return on their inheritance immediately and that\u2019s exactly what they got. \n\nNta", "Exactly they already got their \u201cflat rate and that\u2019s it\u201d when OP bought their shares of the property. Obviously, that wasn\u2019t \u201cit.\u201d", "This is the way", "I meant celebrate the family, not the money but, it\u2019s not some crime to have money, and generally speaking it\u2019s also normal to be generous a bit. Having a nice family dinner doesn\u2019t need to mean \u2018let\u2019s all toast to how rich I am and how poor you are\u2019. It could just be \u201cI am thankful for my family and wanted to do something nice.\u201d", "When it's one company considering multiple locations it's a real gamble. When multiple companies are considering your location then that means there is something about that location that is attractive for investors so those odds go up significantly even if it just takes time."]}
