{"id": 4524, "submission_id": "zjog8v", "title": "AITA for scamming my cousins out of their inheritance?", "selftext": "Those are my cousins\u2019 words, not mine. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong.\n\nYears ago our grandfather passed. In his will, he left our family\u2019s traditional homestead to me and my cousins. This homestead has over 100 acres and is about 90 mins from a very large city. We all had equal shares of the homestead so my cousins wanted to sell it and take the cash. I didn\u2019t.\n\nThe homestead has sentimental values to me and tbh, is quite beautiful. There\u2019s a large pond on it that is fed by a spring and several forest patches randomly throughout the land. I spent some of my best years and some of my most precious memories were made on this land. The best part was that the land was given an agricultural tax designation so the yearly property tax was very low. I also wanted to keep it because I thought it would increase in value due to its location.\n\nBack then several out-of-state companies were talking about moving to our state. In addition, the cities in the area was trying to turn the surrounding areas into Silicon Valley 2 so they were courting tech businesses with tax breaks. I thought the land was going to be in a prime location if any of that comes to pass. \n\nI want to make it clear that none of the businesses moved to our city at point and they didn\u2019t even said they were moving to our state. In fact, our state was one of many on their lists. I didn\u2019t have any inside information and everything I knew was based on the public news available to everyone. I didn\u2019t bring it up to the cousins during our talks. To make a long story short, I bought out their shares at market value. Everything was done legally and everyone was happy at the time.\n\nI held on to the homestead through good times and bad times. I held on to it through many offers from many developers. After about a decade, companies started to move to our state and many to the areas where I predicted they would. My land\u2019s value has soared and developers call me daily with some even visiting in person weekly.\n\nWhile I plan to keep the bulk of the land and am living in the house my great grandfather built, I recently sold 2 acres for 100x the price I paid my cousins for the entire land. When they found out, crap hit the fan. The family exploded and they are screaming I cheated them out of their inheritance. I pointed out it took a decade for anything to happen so it was the very definition of a gamble and I just happen to come out on top. They argue that I should have told them that this could have happened and I argued I made my decision on publicly available information.\n\nMany in the family want me to update their shares but I refuse. I view it as a business gamble I won.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670822812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjog8v/aita_for_scamming_my_cousins_out_of_their/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm pretty sure they haven't invested a single penny since they sold you the property, but you did. It is yours, and you can do whatever the hell you want with it because they sold it when it was theirs. You don't owe them for their bad decisions and the fact that they think you do says a lot about the kind of people they are.", "NTA, you legally bought out their share and especially with the time frame of how things progressed, it's absolutely absurd they are mad about this. They are the ones who originally wanted to just sell the property in the first place. Their fault for not doing any due diligence", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry but how was this a scam in any way? \n\nThey wanted cash and you wanted the land at the time and you gave them what they wanted. The only reason they\u2019re blowing up at you is because they know you and you\u2019re not a random person they sold the land to.\n\nHowever, stop telling family anything about your finances!", "NTA. If they don't like it, they shouldn't have sold out their shares to you.", "NTA-you bought it from them fair and square, it\u2019s yours to do with as your please.", "NTA - they have sellers remorse. Property does tend to increase in value and they chose to take the money 'now' rather than see their inheritance as a long term investment. You're fine but could cut them a 'tip' as goodwill to get over it and move on.", "NTA.  Everybody knows that land values are increasing.  They just wanted instant gratification instead of letting the property sit.  They harassed you to sell and you finally bought their shares.  They made a poor business decision; that\u2019s on them.", "NTA and congratulations you made a great investment and you also get to enjoy the beauty and the memories", "NTA  \n \n\nBefore you sell anything, you evaluate it for this reason. It is their fault, not yours. It is like, I sell you my company, and the circumstance change and the company is making millions. I have no right to ask for updated shares because I already sold it.", "NTA.  Grasshoppers always complain when things go well for the ants.", "NTA", "Nta, and cut them out", "If you had all sold your shares, and you invested the money in a stock that has had extensive growth over the same period of time resulting in a similar windfall profit they\u2019d still claim it\u2019s unfair because they\u2019re jealous.\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA there was always a possibility of land becoming more valuable, how that did not occur to them i have no idea.", "Good, buildable land is ALWAYS a good investment if you keep it that long- especially with agriculture tax credits. NTA at all. It\u2019s their own faults they wanted money then instead of waiting.", "NTA - Everyone in this situation was a grown ass adult and capable of doing their own research. It is not your fault that whatever reasons they had for choosing to sell meant that they lost out on money a decade later.", "Before I read the end I thought of the exact same words that you won. Not them, then bowed out. NTA. You are the one that took the risks and held on to the land.", "NTA. They took their money, probably didn\u2019t help you during lean times. NTA.", "NTA. My parents bought out my aunt and uncle and bought my grandparents land. It\u2019s worth 400x what my grandparents bought it for and about 10x what my parents bought it for. My aunts and uncles are happy it\u2019s stayed in the family. Sorry your family is greedy you did nothing wrong. But I would recommend never discussing finances with them again.", "NTA. They're just mad they didn't do what you did to invest in the land for the last decade. It was completely their decision to sell their shares and take the cash at the time. \nYour investment; your profits. \n\nThink of it this way: if the land had decreased in value since they sold it, your cousins wouldn't be offering to compensate you for the decreased share prices, would they?", "NTA. It's easy to now make the claim that you had the knowledge it would sell for much higher, but realistically that was never a guarantee. I know a lot of people might disagree, but if your family comes after you for something like this then they aren't worth keeping around anyway. Would it absolutely kill me to be on their side of it? Yes. Would I blame anyone but myself? Nope", "NTA. That is their problem that they didn\u2019t think about the future. They could have (or may have) bought another property with their share 10 years ago.", "NTA No one would be offering you money if you lost your investment. But, now they want a piece because you did well.", "NTA- You've gave them market value for the land at the time and have been paying all the taxes on it as well. They were thinking of what they could get right now, while you were thinking of the future. Your gamble paid off and they are mad that they didn't think of that. I would have done the same thing if I had the funds when my grandfather died.", "NTA. They were perfectly happy to sell at the previous price. \u201cSellers remorse\u201d 10 years later is NOT your problem. What if they had sold it to someone else, would they be saying the same thing? No, because they would have no case.", "NTA. The only reason they are doing this is because you are family.  If you had all sold to a third party, they wouldn't be going to that buyer asking for more.     They wanted to sell. You paid fair market price.  Because they now see a lot of money just out of reach, they are crying foul.  If a huge chemical plant moved in and ruined your land, they wouldn't be trying to pay you back any portion of what you paid them.  They were shortsighted when they sold and chances are they blew through the money instead of investing it.", "NTA \n\nLand is a great investment especially when kept for decades. \n\nSheesh. \n\nWhat did they expect", "NTA I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a movie script in here somewhere. Can imagine Kevin Costner being you and you running for governor. Pan to mountain tops and lakes and a good old American boy sitting spitting \u00b1tobacco. But anyway I get distracted,  defo NTA they sold and they didn\u2019t have the patience, you did. Good for you for being smart and playing the long game. You deserve the rewards\u2026they don\u2019t.", "NTA.\nI doubt they would harras any other buyer a decade later. What makes it OK to harras you?\nIf they invested what you paid them at the time and got 100x profits, would you ask them for the cut?\nDon't bother with the issue, go look for nice hotels and excursions for your next vacation.", "NTA. You did what I'd have done: held onto land that had meaning as well as value, and only sold a little when it was more worth it. \n\nIf they'd had their way, they'd have sold everything in the beginning and nobody would've benefited from the change in land value.", "Your cousins inability to delay gratification and their sellers remorse is not your problem. NTA\n\nHowever, looking after family is a pretty cool thing to do. Given the windfall sounds like you\u2019ve won the lottery, but it sounds like your cousins aren\u2019t the most savvy financial managers, could you do something charitable like divert a portion of the profits to set up a trust fund or scholarship program to assist with your nieces and nephews with higher education expenses? \n\nWhat do you think your grandfather would like to see you do?", "NTA \nYour cousins are big time, however.", "NTA\n\nDont forget to do regular posts on social media tagging in your family of you enjoying spending the money", "NTA - you purchased the property fairly. You did not cheat your cousins. Your land is for you to do as you wish.", "Nta. Don't give them a penny. Nearly everyone i know who sold property 10-20 years ago would have made minimum, minimum, 5 times the amount if they still had it to sell now. Its just how it goes. If they really won't leave you alone then get legal advice and have cease and desist letters sent or something.", "Bit torn here. If you had told them \"I think this may be a good future investment and i want to buy this from you to see how things pan out\" you would be a complete NTA. If they were strangers, you didn't have to tell them even that for NTA. This is family though. So while you did nothing wrong, I would still say you are morally the asshole.\n\nThat being said, kudos on the foresight!", "I HAVE EDITED THIS COMMENT!\n\nThis\u2026 that wasn\u2019t a gamble. You knew the price was going to go up, but your cousins sold it to you anyway.\n\nESH.\n\nEdit:\n\nActually, NTA. It\u2019s your land!", "NTA\nThey most likely would have sold their inheritance to foreigners.", "ESH\n\nYou did know stuff that was pertinent and didn't share with family. It wasn't a gamble if multiple companies wanted to move, chances are at least 1 would.  And once one did others would follow. You said it was public knowledge, but that type of info is not widely shared in news etc, it's highly specific and you were counting on them not knowing.\n\nHowever, they did sell, and had you also sold, it's not like they could go to a stranger and say give us more now. \n\nHowever had you shared your thoughts at selling time, with FAMILY, then they would have been free to make their decision with equal facts. \n\nGetting 100x what you've paid them, I'm guessing takes you into millionaire territory, with potential for more millions. That is a result of you not sharing info with your family,", "NTA", "NTA, they wanted the money you wanted the land, had you all sold it at the time, you\u2019d all be regretting it. Only thing is they now can funnel that frustration to you. You didn\u2019t think short term, you thought long term, they didn\u2019t. Their loss.", "NTA, you were the smart one. Your investment paid off, congratulations. They got their money at the time and now they are just pissed they didn\u2019t look at the bigger picture and got greedy.", "NTA How is it your fault if they could not be bothered doing their due diligence?", "NTA.  They wanted to cash out and you obliged them.  They don't get to come back a decade later and complain about money you made off that.", "NTA. Real estate is almost always an excellent long-term investment. Sometimes it doesn't feel that way in the short-term, but practically every parcel of land or house has increased significantly in value in the last ten years.", "NTA. You took all the risk and you therefore get the reward.", "NTA. They sold their shares to you fairly. Had you told them 10 years ago that you thought it would happen I doubt it would have changed anything. They were obviously thinking of the present and you were considering the future. You took a risk and it paid off, had your cousins had any forethought maybe they would have thought about the future as well. Sucks to be them.", "They don\u2019t have any shares since you bought them out. Your cousins are being jealous assholes who don\u2019t know how to research. That is their fault and not yours. NTA.", "NTA, if the price would have dropped, they would have mocked and made fun of you for not selling the land as they initially wanted to. They're mad because they didn't think about or dismissed the idea that the land could increase in price.", "NTA. You paid them market value. The market shifted, as it does.", "NTA. This wasn't a predatory agreement in any way. They would have sold to anyone back then, would they be screaming the same thing to whoever that was if it wasn't you? Nope. Remind them of that.", "NTA. You did your due diligence using publicly available information and took a risk that at some point developers would be interested in the property. Your family saw dollar signs, sold their shares to you, and now 10 years later they regret it. Real estate is generally a good investment as long as you do the research and make decisions based on information and not emotion.", "NTA. Investment needs patience that you had and they didn\u2019t. Now that you get to reap the profits, they have no say and no right to demand anything from you. They wanted to sell, they would have sold it to someone else if not you. But the only difference would be they wouldn\u2019t have been able to cry about being cheated at you as they are now", "NTA.  You had no insider information but relied instead on information in the public domain.  They wanted instant gratification.  You played the long game.  They had the same opportunity you did.  No one forced them to sell their shares back then.  Ignore the whining.", "NTA.", "NTA and don\u2019t let them bully you into budging one bit. You researched, put in effort, and waited. They want the rewards for none of the work. Sucks to suck!", "NTA If your cousins took the money you gave them for the purchase the land, at fair market value, and bought bitcoin at 0.40 per coin - would they owe you today for the increased value of their investment?  Each $0.40 coin is now worth $23,000.  Anyway, of course not.  Just like you owe them nothing today.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's the surest way to get users to keep using you. The sale was a business transaction that has been completed for years. It is over and should stay that way.", "Do you think any of the cousins would offering to bail them out if the land had lost value and now they were facing bankruptcy? Nothing that OP posted indicates that any of them NEED the money, just that they are mad they don't have it.", "Almost any land anywhere will increase in value over the time period that OP waited. Good buildable land (if you can just hold onto it and pay the taxes) is always a good investment.", "When you sell something you're not just \"renting\" it to someone or \"leasing\" it. \n\nYou literally revoke *ALL* rights to said property being sold. \n\nHe ain't the asshole\nThose who he bought out fully well knew the value could appreciate but took on the calculated risk that that (presumably) wouldn't happen. \n\nOtherwise, said family wouldn't have sold but would have exercised one of the options mentioned above. \n\nI therefore think morally OP ain't the asshole either. \n\nNow if he bought them out at no market value or  committed estate fraud or something like that THEN I would agree with you. But that didn't occur here.\n\nEdit: thought experiment here. Given the risk OP took on would said family be on the hook if the value dropped and OP was \"bagholding\"? Absolutely not right? That's ridiculous wouldn't it?", "It was never a guarantee. It was an informed gamble, but a gamble nonetheless.", "No one ever knows the price will definitively go up on any investment.With this logic the stock market would be easy to beat.", "if you changed it make it \u2018E S H\u2019 so it doesn\u2019t count", "Op was under no obligation to share the information. It\u2019s not like it was a sure bet or anything. It took ten years or more to pan out. Also, land almost always increases in value over time. Even not knowing specifics, the cousins should have realized based on common sense that it would be worth more in the future than it was when they sold it.", "If you sell your property, it is YOUR responsibility to understand the value. I don\u2019t care who the buyer is, the seller is responsible for setting their price and understanding that they are selling to someone who FULLY intends that property to become worth more than what they paid. Otherwise, why buy it? Sorry, it\u2019s just not reasonable to expect him to tell his family something that SHOULD be obvious: I\u2019m buying you out because I think this property is worth more than what I\u2019m paying you for it.", "The information was public and they did the sales legally. So if they had done their research or had good lawyers they would have known the same public information op knew. They jumped the gun and wanted to sell the moment they found out they inherited a part of the property. Seeing as they are mad now they clearly are only about money and nothing else.", "Agreed. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile.", "My bet is the family will be asking for money anyway, given it sounds like OP may be in millionaire territory off this. So rather a 'flat rate and that's it' than dealing with that nonsense forever? If OP really cares to keep them in their life at all, fair call if not.", "I agree. His cousins also had access to the same information he did, and decided to sell out anyway. It was clearly not a gamble they had any stomach for.", "Honestly, land almost never goes down in value. They're not making more of it you know.\n\nThat's a given fact of land ownership. It might take a lifetime but it will go up 99% of the time. And since that's pretty much a given fact of life they should have known this could happen.\n\nAsk your cousins, if they'd sold to an outsider back in the day would they be yelling about being scammed when prices went up 10 years later? This is no different.\n\nYou paid what they'd have asked for from an outsider right? Then there's no way you scammed them.", "Land is the one thing you can almost guarantee will go up. It's very rare for it to decrease over time. It happens but that's usually because some other event rendered it useless.\n\nIt might decrease in the near term but over a span of a decade you can almost guarantee a return on the investment.", "Yeah no obligation, but it's also not some random he was working with. It was family. Unless his family have always been evil to him.\n\n Chances are had he said btw this might happen, but is a gamble, they would have still sold. And he would be free of any blame. But he didn't. And no land near me has ever increased by so much in a short period of time..Say he paid $50k to buy, he has $5m now. And still has 98% of land left. So would stand to make $250m. And that's a Conservative guess, he probably paid more to start with.", "Maybe. But if the land ended up being worth less today, would the cousins be AH for not convincing him to sell when they did? No. I think the same reasoning has to apply. They\u2019re all adults, and they made their choices. They have to live with them.", "By OPs own admission multiple companies were looking to move. So it was never going to be the \"gamble\" made out to be. And as you said land always increases, so would not be worth less, so even if it was a gamble and noone moved there, they would just be in same or slightly better position.  I'm not saying cousin's are not at fault, but OP should have done curtesy btw, this is what I've read what do you think?", "I don\u2019t know, I think it depends on their relationship. If they were close as cousins, then yeah it would have been nice and probably expected for him to discuss it more with them. If their relationship was distant or even acrimonious, I think what op did was totally reasonable. You don\u2019t owe special consideration to people just because you share a common ancestor."]}
