{"id": 4524, "submission_id": "zjog8v", "title": "AITA for scamming my cousins out of their inheritance?", "selftext": "Those are my cousins\u2019 words, not mine. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong.\n\nYears ago our grandfather passed. In his will, he left our family\u2019s traditional homestead to me and my cousins. This homestead has over 100 acres and is about 90 mins from a very large city. We all had equal shares of the homestead so my cousins wanted to sell it and take the cash. I didn\u2019t.\n\nThe homestead has sentimental values to me and tbh, is quite beautiful. There\u2019s a large pond on it that is fed by a spring and several forest patches randomly throughout the land. I spent some of my best years and some of my most precious memories were made on this land. The best part was that the land was given an agricultural tax designation so the yearly property tax was very low. I also wanted to keep it because I thought it would increase in value due to its location.\n\nBack then several out-of-state companies were talking about moving to our state. In addition, the cities in the area was trying to turn the surrounding areas into Silicon Valley 2 so they were courting tech businesses with tax breaks. I thought the land was going to be in a prime location if any of that comes to pass. \n\nI want to make it clear that none of the businesses moved to our city at point and they didn\u2019t even said they were moving to our state. In fact, our state was one of many on their lists. I didn\u2019t have any inside information and everything I knew was based on the public news available to everyone. I didn\u2019t bring it up to the cousins during our talks. To make a long story short, I bought out their shares at market value. Everything was done legally and everyone was happy at the time.\n\nI held on to the homestead through good times and bad times. I held on to it through many offers from many developers. After about a decade, companies started to move to our state and many to the areas where I predicted they would. My land\u2019s value has soared and developers call me daily with some even visiting in person weekly.\n\nWhile I plan to keep the bulk of the land and am living in the house my great grandfather built, I recently sold 2 acres for 100x the price I paid my cousins for the entire land. When they found out, crap hit the fan. The family exploded and they are screaming I cheated them out of their inheritance. I pointed out it took a decade for anything to happen so it was the very definition of a gamble and I just happen to come out on top. They argue that I should have told them that this could have happened and I argued I made my decision on publicly available information.\n\nMany in the family want me to update their shares but I refuse. I view it as a business gamble I won.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m going to answer some questions asked.\n\n1. At the time I was the youngest of the cousins. I was a senior in college while the others were between their mid 20s to late 30s.\n2. At the time I was pursuing my finance degree. Some of the cousins didn\u2019t attend college while others had degrees.\n4. Our grandfather had kids and he left them money, other properties, and stakes in his business. He left the grandkids the homestead because we all spent our summers there riding horses, fishing, camping, etc.\n3. Had I refused to sell, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to sell. However it never got to that point. When they told me they wanted to sell, I asked for a week to think about it. When the week was up, I came back and told them I would buy their shares. We got the property appraised and we all agreed on the appraised price.\n4. I sold everything I had including my car. I borrowed the rest from my parents. They loaned me the money without interest so as long as I keep the house. That wasn\u2019t a problem since I love that place.", "created_utc": 1670822812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjog8v/aita_for_scamming_my_cousins_out_of_their/", "score": 481, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their fault for not doing any due diligence", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry but how was this a scam in any way? \n\nThey wanted cash and you wanted the land at the time and you gave them what they wanted.

Property does tend to increase in value and they chose to take the money 'now' rather than see their inheritance as a long term investment. You're fine but could cut them a 'tip' as goodwill to get over it and move on.", "NTA.  Everybody knows that land values are increasing.  They just wanted instant gratification instead of letting the property sit.  They harassed you to sell and you finally bought their shares.  They made a poor business decision; that\u2019s on them.", "NTA and congratulations you made a great investment and you also get to enjoy the beauty and the memories", "NTA  \n \n\nBefore you sell anything, you evaluate it for this reason.

NTA at all. It\u2019s their own faults they wanted money then instead of waiting.", "NTA - Everyone in this situation was a grown ass adult and capable of doing their own research. It is not your fault that whatever reasons they had for choosing to sell meant that they lost out on money a decade later.", "Before I read the end I thought of the exact same words that you won.

They're just mad they didn't do what you did to invest in the land for the last decade.

It's easy to now make the claim that you had the knowledge it would sell for much higher, but realistically that was never a guarantee. I know a lot of people might disagree, but if your family comes after you for something like this then they aren't worth keeping around anyway. Would it absolutely kill me to be on their side of it? Yes. Would I blame anyone but myself? Nope", "NTA. That is their problem that they didn\u2019t think about the future.

I would have done the same thing if I had the funds when my grandfather died.", "NTA.

No, because they would have no case.", "NTA. The only reason they are doing this is because you are family.  If you had all sold to a third party, they wouldn't be going to that buyer asking for more.     They wanted to sell. You paid fair market price.  Because they now see a lot of money just out of reach, they are crying foul.

It was family. Unless his family have always been evil to him.\n\n Chances are had he said btw this might happen, but is a gamble, they would have still sold. And he would be free of any blame. But he didn't. And no land near me has ever increased by so much in a short period of time..Say he paid $50k to buy, he has $5m now. And still has 98% of land left. So would stand to make $250m. And that's a Conservative guess, he probably paid more to start with.", "Maybe. But if the land ended up being worth less today, would the cousins be AH for not convincing him to sell when they did? No. I think the same reasoning has to apply. They\u2019re all adults, and they made their choices. They have to live with them.", "By OPs own admission multiple companies were looking to move. So it was never going to be the \"gamble\" made out to be. And as you said land always increases, so would not be worth less, so even if it was a gamble and noone moved there, they would just be in same or slightly better position.

They sold their shares a decade ago. They do not have the tiniest little leg to stand on here.\n\nI know some other commenters have suggested giving them a bit out of kindness/ for relations. For me, when people decide to aggressively accuse me of ill intent, I'm not so inclined to give them anything. Plus, you would almost have to take further legal action to prevent them from trying to use any generosity from you as proof that they should get 'their full share of their inheritance'. Poppycock!", "NTA\n\nYou paid a fair prucd which they accepted.

Hello, hello, are you still there?\"", "THIS! OP, why do they know what you sold it for? Chalk this one up to experience and tell them nothing moving forward.", "No! Do not give those mice a cookie!", "That\u2019s the wrong move. \u201cTipping\u201d means acknowledging fault and then OP is making a bigger mess. They will be emboldened and also keep demanding more money.", "Have they never read any fable story books?? give them a copy of The Goose That Lay The Golden Egg. That\u2019s a tip that uncles and aunties should\u2019ve given them as kids.", "How did he know something they didn\u2019t? It was essentially well-known town gossip that op decided to take a chance on and it paid off. Everyone had access to the same information, but even if his cousins didn\u2019t they still chose to sell without really thinking through all the possibilities so that\u2019s 100% on them", "Propety sales are public information. So they have to have the sale price on registers.", "No, it doesn't acknowledge wrong doing - it's sharing the wealth if OP cares to. Completely a call for OP to make as we would in our own family scenarios.", "We just don\u2019t know. They might have? \n\nFrom the choices of the cousins to sell, it seems more likely that there isn\u2019t a pre-existing slush fund of intergenerational wealth to draw down on, aside from gramps land, since they were in a position to want/need the money upfront. \n\nI\u2019m not suggesting OP has to be charitable in any way. \n\nIt\u2019s OP\u2019s money and they can do whatever they want with it. \n\nThe tone in OP\u2019s post read to me like the friction in the family was weighing pretty heavily on them. \n\nIt was a suggestion intended to find a solution that would smooth out the family drama without needing to shell out more cash just to be frittered away by financially illiterate relatives.", "Take what I say with a boulder of salt here cause I'm not a lawyer, but it feels like compensating them now could bite OP in the ass later if they decide to use that legally against him as an admission that he owes them something. \n\nI don't think it'd be that strong of an argument, but rather cover your ass when dealing with vultures like this.", "It LOOKS that way. Its almost like if after 4 years you make a payment to a debt collector, it starts it up again. OPs cousin could look at it like OP screwed us and is making up for it. Even after years of something happening, it just takes when one realizes it happened to take it to court. Best course of action is ignore them.", "This this this this this this this this thissssssssssssssssssssssssss.\n\nDO NOT give them any money because that would be setting a bad precedent legally.\n\nNTA too.", "It was a gamble though because those companies were  considering multiple locations and op\u2019s town was just one of many", "YTA. Your greed is dripping in the post. If anything, I feel sorry for the land and the animals/plants that live there.", "NTA. They made their choice years ago .", "NTA. Absolutely don\u2019t give in. You didn\u2019t scam anybody.", "NTA. They are just greedy, if you didn't told them about your gamble they would have asked anyway because it wouldn't be \"fair\" otherwise.", "NTA they were privy to the same public information as you they could of researched you had to wait 10 years to see your money back. They could of invested their money in the mean time to improve their lives ;guessing they didn\u2019t) as a minimum hope they paid off part of their mortgage", "Ask them if it lost value for whatever reason, if they would make good on the difference between what you paid them and what it's worth now.\n\nI mean, they'll likely lie and say they would, but everyone knows they wouldn't\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nthey could have used the money you paid for their share to do anything, Buy Amazon, or Tesla, or Bitcoins or whateever, \n\nI think probably best not to divulge or confirm any financial matters to them in the future.", "NTA- It's their own fault, you'd be unlucky if land hadn't increased in value in that time. The fact that it was such an increase was also all but blind luck. Also crucial: if this had never happened, you'd have happily kept the whole property forever. Meanwhile they all presumably got to keep visiting and enjoying the property they wanted to sell to a stranger.", "NTA\n\nland prices rise and fall, if it fell below the valuation price in the following years would the cousins give you the money back? I doubt it.\n\nThis is a normal business risk that is not your responsibility.", "NTA. You did everything right and legal. They are just greedy and jealous.", "NTA \nit sounds like you did something with a sentimental intention and this has rewarded you. Your cousins could have held on to their shares but wanted to dispose of them as soon as they could. Everyone makes choices. \nDon\u2019t let them guilt you", "If they sold it to someone outwith family and 10 years later they sold it on would they be chasing them down for more money? Of course they wouldn't! They're just annoyed and jealous that they're missing out. NTA", "NTA. You didn't cheat them out of anything. They chose to sell the land when they wanted to sell the land.", "NTA f\\*ck em you gambled and won they gambled and lost.", "NTA well done for doing well.", "NTA - they got fair market price for their pieces.", "NTA, in any sense lol", "NTA. They wanted to sell their shares of the land for market value and that's exactly what they were able to do. It doesn't really matter whether the buyer was you or some other random investor. If it had been some other investor would they now go seek him out 10 years after the fact and accuse him of scamming them out of their inheritance? Of course not because that accusation makes no sense.", "Ask your family that if the land had decreased in value since the time you bought them out, would they give you the extra money back. I seriously doubt that they would.", "YTA and you know it:\n\n>  I didn\u2019t bring it up to the cousins during our talks.\n\nYou had learned information they had not, and acted on it. While yes it was public information, not everyone is reading all news all the time. Had you told them the information they could have decided what to do with it, sell, or not. By witholding you became the sole owner with which developers had to deal.\n\nSo yes you effectively scammed your family.\n\nGod I hate how inheritances bring out the greed in people.", "NTA.  The cousins wanted quick cash and they got it.  If OP secretly had an offer on the table and sold it a short time later it would be different.  However, we\u2019re talking 10+ years later where OP owned the land, lived on the land, maintained the land and paid taxes on the land.    \n\n\nThe title is misleading as no one was scammed.  OP paid his cousins market value for the land which means the amount they would have gotten if they sold to anyone else; so no family discount was factored in.  In fact they probably got more by selling to OP as after a few weeks on market people start to drop the price in order to sell.  No one was scammed and OP does not owe his cousins a penny more.", "NTA\n\nYou can't sell a house to a stranger then get mad 10 years later it's appreciated in value for the new owners. This is the exact same thing, and they are only mad because they are greedy. Do not 'tip' them with extra money, do not discuss the sale with them, do not inform them of future sales.\n\nThey wanted their money 10 years ago and they got it.", "NTA\n\nthis wasn't a scam in any way, they're just mad.\n\nThey were happy when they sold their share, but got mad when U spent over a decade to get it to that value?\n\nI agree it was a business gamble, and U 100% won it .", "NTA, but this is why you don't tell anyone you've come into money.\n\nNow your best option might be to move away to somewhere nice and forget about them all.", "NTA\n\n10 years later they want to complain? Heck no. Most properties increase in value over time, even if it's not that drastic. They can't be mad that, over time, your property that they willingly sold you is more valuable. Doesn't matter how much more valuable.\n\nOr, they can be mad and they can die mad about it cuz you did nothing wrong.\n\nSome people are bad about considering the future and only thinking about the now when it comes to these things. Plus, you kept something that was precious to YOU, which is far more upstanding morally, in my opinion. They just want money.", "In the same way that I wouldn\u2019t go back to the current owners of my last property and ask for extra money based on its current value, they cannot come to you and do the same. You had it appraised at the time and everyone agreed to it. It\u2019s your land and you owe them nothing. Do not give them anything as it would be an admission of \u2018guilt\u2019 even though you should have none as it is all above board. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nTheir own fault for not realizing land is valuable and have every chance of soaring up in value in the future too, too bad for them. They sold on their own terms, you really did win. Congrats lol", "> I\u2019m sorry but how was this a scam in any way?\n\nThe scam was they wanted the cash then, but they also still want it now.", "The tip is a bad idea, it could provide a legal complication. An indication that you agreed to pay them for the land value increase.", "> Property does tend to increase in value \n\nThere is a massive difference with basic yearly increase and 'hey this is becomming a hotzone for developers'.", "I agree with everything but that last sentence. If you give them an inch, they will want a mile. It's a tough shit situation cause they sold it", "He was the youngest so it's not like he was more experienced lol he was just Smart and loved the land", "I would say that even if they didn't know or consider that possible return on the property investment the market rate at the time would have and OP said he paid them that. \n\nThe potential chance of return is baked into the price of every piece of property by people who know what OP knows and probably even more. \n\n\"It's priced in\" is a meme for a reason. It's because it's true.", "> My bet is the family will be asking for money anyway\n\nAnd they can get bent every time.\n\n> So rather a 'flat rate and that's it' than dealing with that nonsense forever?\n\nOP will be dealing with this forever, if they give in now they\u2019ll set a precedent, and one that could actually have a legal weight.\n\nOP bought the shares at market value at the time, the cousins wanted to sell and burn the cash", "Nah. There\u2019s no obligation to pick up their calls or talk if they want to be sour forever", "It could provide a legal complication. An indication that you agreed to pay them for the land value increase."]}
