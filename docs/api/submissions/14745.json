Me and his brothers all consider ourselves kind of carnivorous, but apart from the standard ribbing (pun not intended) I told him that, as an exercise in responsibility, he'd be responsible for preparing his own food. He's totally okay with this, and so everything was progressing well until a few days ago. The wife and I were throwing a house party/potluck. I grilled a few steaks and smoked a brisket for the occasion, and my wife made chicken parmesan. and as the guests filed in and the table filled out, J asked if we had made anything for him to eat. I reminded him of our agreement, and he said he didn't think it would extend to parties where we were making food for a ton of guests. I laughed a bit and told him he should have asked in advance so he could prepare, but he could probably bank on one of our guests to bring something vegetarian.\n\nI guess the only vegetarian option turned out to be spring rolls, because I saw his plate and that's all he had on there. One of my friends saw too and asked what was up, and J told him he was veg and that we hadn't made anything for him. My friend poked fun at me but it was pretty clear he thought less of me for not making food for the kid. After the party I laid into J a bit for talking bad about me in front of guests, and he said all he did was tell them the truth. This put me out a bit, but he's pretty set on his feelings.

If you wanted to keep up that rule you should've checked in with him to make sure he had something to eat.

I was also the only vegetarian in my family 20 years ago, before we got all these veggie food products that we have today. At BBQs and parties, I was still able to eat pasta salad, skewers, veggies with dips, etc. There were always loads of things.

Shame on you for blaming him. You embarrassed & shamed yourself!", "Id say YTA though. if he wants special meat-like substitute products he might buy it for himself. but even for meat eaters there should be nothing wrong with throwing some vegetables or potatoes on the grill. just eating meat only isnt healthy anyway, and even guests might like some variety. he is your own child, why you didnt include him in your food plan.", "YTA\n\nYour sons vegetarian, you might not like that but you\u2019re still responsible for feeding him.\n\nI get that when he first went vegetarian, you had him cook his own stuff.

This cooking separately isn\u2019t a \u201cresponsibility exercise\u201d anymore it\u2019s bullying him for being different.\n\nYou put on a party and cook for dozens of extra guests but not even provide food your son could cook himself. He\u2019s 15, does he have to go get a job and rent a kitchen and be all independent because he doesn\u2019t eat meat anymore?\n\nWe feed prisoners of war and convicts of terrible crimes according to their beliefs and dietary requirements. You publicly didn\u2019t do that for your own child. Maybe you thought it was funny until you saw how your friend reacted.\n\nYou should be angry, and ashamed, but with yourself not J.
