Given how easy it is to change the shipping address, I can't fathom why they would go through the delay and inconvenience of having a friend pick up packages anyway.  That said, you could be open to legal action if you just throw it away.  Contact the seller and tell them the issue and ask what to do with the package.  They may tell you to keep it or arrange to pick it up.", "Imagine not knowing a person at all,\nNot owning the property at all,\nAnd still expecting to have packages delivered there.\nJust think about how delusional that is. Anyways, if the boxes are from FEDEX, or you see UPS/USPS, Amazon, etc drop them off, take it back to the original carrier. When you do this they normally send the merchandise back to where it came from. And it'll take them even longer to get their package if they end up having to reorder. That's what I'd do.

Assuming you like in the US, an address change takes 10 minutes max to complete on the USPS website. \n\nStart a bonfire with any more mail.", "NTA. Just file a change of address notice with the post office-- even if you don't know where they moved to, you can tell the post office to stop delivering their stuff-- and you can also notify UPS/FedEx to not deliver to those names any more. Your stuff should still arrive as normal. 5 minutes of online form-filling will solve this problem for you.", "Do not throw anything out.\n\nJust write \u201cReturn to Sender.

That could get you into trouble if you do it often. Talk to the mail person or leave a note that says they don't live here anymore and to fill out a MLNA for [firstname lastname].

Mark it as Not At This Address and send it back.\n\nI went so far as to put a note inside the door of my mailbox notifying the carrier that \"<name> sold the property on <date> please do not leave mail for them\" and after a couple weeks I got a little address change notification in the mail because one of the carriers took the time to put it in for them! \n\nPackages delivered by anyone but the postal service are another matter BUT you can still put a note on the door in the hopes that they see it and don't leave the package. You can drop them back at the local shipping place and have them returned though - which I understand is an inconvenience - but gets the point across.", "NTA. Return to sender. If it's still going on this long after purchase. I'd question what's being sent to your home instead of Thier's. Leave it on the front porch.", "NTA - you've already been more than patient.

I agree with the others, start marking everything return to sender addressee' unknown.", "NTA, but don't throw it out, look up your post office's method for marking the address as incorrect.  For the USPS, writing 'not at this address' in sharpie on the mail and sending it back will return to sender, and hopefully start getting address lists updated.", "NTA: You've been doing them a favor you don't have to do, you've asked them to resolve the problem, and they simply haven't. If this was 1 month I would give grace, but 7!? That's wild.", "US Mail can be marked \"Return to Sender\" and dropped in a mailbox -- but make sure you obliterate **all** barcodes on the envelope, or it's going to be re-delivered to you.", "NTA - something similar actually happened to a friend of mine.

Kept making excuses about not updating addresses etc\n\nUntil half a year later, the police turned up to question why lots of goods were being ordered to his address using stolen credit card details. The police work slow on low level fraud, apparently.\n\nJust tell them everything delivered will be refused as return to sender. Anything left on the doorstep will be immediately disposed of at the council recycling centre (dont say bin, bin diving is a thing)", "NTA\n\n7 weeks? Okay, sometimes it takes time to remember EVERYTHNG you need to change an address on.\n\n7 Months???

I bought a house in December, the previous owners also apparently haven't updated their address, I just throw their shit away.\n\nYou're not their post office box. Getting your mail forwarded is EASY (at least in the US). Not ordering stuff to your old address is even EASIER.", "NTA but just a piece of advice... throwing away mail that is not yours is a fellony, and they could press charges against you. Take a sharpi, writer \"RETURN TO SENDER\" and stick it back in the mailbox to avoid any legal issues. Or even, leave a note on your door for the delivery person asking them to NOT drop any packages on your doorstep for those people. You can even go to the post office and ask directly the mailman to return them for you.", "You can do a change of adress online in most countries now it takes like 10 minutes,  start writing Return to sender on all their packages. no resident of this name on them.", "NTA", "NTA  \n\n\nShouldn't the post office have their address for other mail, like bills? Return a package to the post office, give them the details that are on the box, like names...and see if they can just forward it to the new address.

This isnt your job and theyre very much imposing.", "I ran into this before at a place. I had about six packages from ups and the one day I caught the ups driver making a delivery I had them take all the packages back.", "NTA - if you really want to get them, return the package to the sender with the note \"Recipient Deceased\".   That will start the process to shutting down a BUNCH of their accounts and will take them months to un-fuck it.", "\ud83c\udfb5 Return to Sender\n\nAddress Unknown \ud83c\udfb5 \n\nRTS their stuff back to where it came from.", "If in the US, you can not throw out packages or mail, especially from the post office.

You can also be accused of theft.", "NTA", "NTA.  If you\u2019re in the US you can call the postmaster and have them stop any mail being delivered that is not addressed to you or someone in your household. UPS and Fed Ex will pick them up if you call and tell them the packages were mis-addressed.  I would not recommend tossing them because you could end up being responsible for their loss (per the postmaster).  I went through this same crap for 2 years before I figured out how to fix it.", "NTA.  They\u2019ve had seven months to change their mailing address and apparently need a kick in the rear to motivate them to get it done.", "NTA. Standard royal mail redirect is about 3 months. I would have started binning them straight after that if not before.", "NTA They had enough time to change their adress.", "NTA - you have done your due diligence.

Return to Sender and call it a day.", "Seven months is WAY too long to be accepting packages and having a \"Friend\" do a 9 PM pick-up is unsat.\n\nDon't throw away but you can do a \"Return to Sender\"\n\nIt's time to \"break-up\" with these people.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nThe previous owners of our house own a business. We have lived here for 4 years now and we STILL get mail for their business. I've been letting them know when we get some for years. They have moved TWICE since we bought the house.

Letting them know about the packages and not throwing them out is basic courtesy. So is their picking up the packages and changing addresses. If they go too slowly on this, setting a deadline is reasonable, and is an okay thing to do. You\u2019ve done that. NTA", "Refuse to accept deliveries from couriers. Any mail return to sender with \u201cnot known at this address\u201d - that is usually free. Anything else you can throw away.\n\nI could just about understand letters still coming - but not packages. Not updating your address on your mobile/cell phone that you\u2019re paying is almost forgivable for a few months (not 7) but who orders stuff to be sent to them or puts people to that inconvenience?", "NTA. Start marking anything from the post office Address Unknown or No Longer at Address and the postal carrier should take it back. \n\nYou've been more than accommodating.

You're not their mother", "NTA, they moved out 7 months ago and they still haven't changed their delivery address? That's just lazy and careless on their part. \n\nYou've been very considerate for putting up with this behaviour for so long, but it honestly isn't your problem to deal with, just send the post back to the sender / mail depot (if you can) and let them sort it out themselves.", "We bought our house 2 years ago. For the first few weeks we kept their stuff and asked the auctioneer to let the previous owners know, which they did. The owners came and collected their stuff.\n\nBut 2 years later we still get the occasional letter for them. Just goes straight in the bin.", "NTA, I wouldn't throw it away but I would return to sender all their shit", "NTA - \n\nI\u2019d keep the packages if they were left there for 7 months. They clearly don\u2019t care about them lol. Also a bunch of packages accumulating is stressful. You have to unconsciously monitor those packages, make sure everything\u2019s ok and that isn\u2019t your job.", "NTA  we had that issue a while back.  We did the same thing for about 2 years then we had enough.  Told the post office they no longer live there.  After that anything that was delivered was either dropped back off at the PO or discarded.", "NTA.  Do NOT throw anything away.  Just mark everything RETURN TO SENDER, NAME UNKNOWN, DOES NOT LIVE HERE.  \n\nYou allowed this to go on too long.  Stop enabling bad behavior.", "NTA They were difficult to deal with during the purchase? Screw them. You've been accommodating for much too long. 'return to sender' is called for. You owe them exactly zero favors.", "NTA\n \n\nRefuse the packages so they get returned", "Fun fact: if it is a package not delivered by USPS, it isn't tampering.", "Thanks for your suggestion, here they just get left by the door.", "This! You are legally required to send them back/refuse delivery. But I guess once they have to pay extra delivery for a couple of items, they'll learn. Also, don't hand anything over to the friend, they'll claim her wasn't allowed to /never got it.", "Lol I hear you but I find that unlikely,  these are elderly folks (or I would not have put up with this for so long). I think its simple laziness.", "It depends on the country, but that normally only applies to the state-run delivery service. If you are getting something from Amazon it doesn't apply, because its a private transaction, being delivered by a private company, eg DHL or FedEx", "Thank you!", "OP could print off a pile of labels saying: NOT KNOWN AT THIS ADDRESS - RETURN TO SENDER, and just slap one on everything that comes to the house.", "\ud83c\udfb6 No such person\n\nNo such zone \ud83c\udfb6", "This is exactly what I was going to say. It\u2019s a very fine line throwing out someone\u2019s mail. Can be counted as illegal in some places so simply write \u2018unknown at this address\u2019 on everything and put it back in a post box. At worst they lose some stuff but it\u2019s their issue and at best their senders will get in touch with them direct and get their new address! That way your hands are clean.", "This is the way.  Also, write on the envelopes, \"Not at this address\" and put them back in the mail.  The PO will send them back to the originator.  For bills and the like, it will end up creating a mess for them that is totally their fault.", "Damn sounds like you have EVRI they doe the same . Use to be Hermes.  I would be the ass hole and threaten to start selling there goods if they dont update there address", "You can also contact the delivery service customer service number or sometimes website and update delivery instructions for your address that you will not be accepting packages sent to x name.", "You can refuse packages sent by private carriers, too.
