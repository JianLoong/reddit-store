Recently my wife has insisted on putting our son in daycare. My wife is claiming that she doesn't get enough free time to pursue the things she wants to do. She feels that I have more free time and that it isn't fair that I have more free time than her.\n\n\r  \nI currently work 3rd shift remotely from home. On a normal workday I start work between 9pm and 10pm and finish between 6am and 8am. I try to go to sleep as soon as I get done working. Some days depending on when our son wakes up I may help with the morning feeding or doing some chores like taking the trash out etc. Other days I go to sleep right away. I typically wake up between 12pm and 2pm. Once I wake up I spend time with my wife and son. I do typical parenting duties/Household chores during this time and I am often alone with my son while my wife does other things. I stay awake until my work shift starts and the process starts over again. \n\n2 or 3 times a week I will go for a run which takes an hour or so. Once a week or 2 I will go for a bike ride with friends. I try to do this while they are sleeping but sometimes I will do this when they are awake.\n\n\r  \nOur son's schedule is pretty consistent. He wakes up between 6:30am and 8am. Normally naps from 10am to 12pm and again from 3pm to 4-5pm. He Typically goes to bed between 8pm and 9:30pm. During the day when I am sleeping my wife's older son will watch the baby a few hours a day. Sometimes he will watch him when me and my wife do things together like going grocery shopping or things of that nature.\n\n\r  \nThis is where most her contention comes from. On the weekends I finish my Friday shift around 6am to 8am Saturday morning. I sleep and wake up like I would normally. Once I am awake we spend time together and share the household/parenting responsibilities. On the weekends I am typically the one who will put our son to bed. Soon after my wife goes to sleep. Now I am alone for the rest of the night, awake because, that is my schedule. My wife really see's this time I am awake from the time she does to sleep until the next morning as desirable. For me it's not that great. I have to be extremely quiet not wake up anyone. Nothing is open, No friends or family is awake. It's pretty lonely and boring honestly. I would much rather spend time with her and our son. \n\n\r  \nMy wife has proposed putting our son in Daycare for 5 hours a day so that she can have more free time. Before our son was born we decided that he wouldn't go to daycare until he was 2 years old. If there are issues or something bad happening to him we would like him to be able to verbalize the issue. \n\n\r  \nI told my wife I thought it was better for him to be home with us than go to daycare. I also told her I didn't think it made sense for us to pay for daycare if she isn't working. I also asked her \"How many stay at home moms send their kids to daycare\".

You go into a lot of detail about your schedule, but not hers. It sounds like her main contention is free time but you don't explain how much free time she currently has.\n\nLook, you're right that she's a stay at home parent, and being able to send your kid to daycare while one parent stays at home is an incredible privilege, and I can see you why you think it doesn't make sense to pay for daycare when she isn't working. Especially if she wants it for 5 hours a day, 5 days a week?

The childcare adds yet another financial pressure, although you may be in a position to afford this.", "Slight YTA. You consider the time that the baby is napping to be free time for your wife. But it really isn\u2019t free time. She still needs to be available for the baby, and do household chores during that time.", "NAH\n\nLook, bottom line is that your wife is telling you she is unhappy in the current setup. If that's something you guys can fix, then you should.\n\nCan you do some other option that splits the difference? Could you hire a babysitter to occupy your son while your wife is still home - my mom did this when I was little rather than daycare so she had some time to herself and to handle chore or cooking. Could he go to little kids playgroup that isn't as extensive as daycare?

Paying for daycare for her to do nothing at home is a waste of money", "He is 20 and watches him at minimum 2 to 3 hours a day.", "You are right. Best laid plans and all. I agree with you. I want my wife to be happy. I really do but, I just find this unreasonable. \n\nI am also super paranoid about something bad happening to him at daycare. (My wife feels the same way) We don't live in the US and an abnormal amount of kids die in daycare/school here.", "To add to this - something for OP to consider, while the wife is sleeping, it's still \"parenting time\" - if the child wakes up in the middle of the night, is sick, etc. she is the one who takes care of the child - while OP sleeps, she's also taking care of the child.  That's not considered \"free time\"  This may not be something OP is considering.", "100% agree with this, the key question is how much free time does each parent have - just like OP spends a certain number of hours working, his wife spends a certain number of hours caring for their child/doing household chores/etc.   Probably more than OP realizes, in fact. \n\nOP needs to take an honest account of how many waking hours each of them really has to just be themselves after all the needs (work, childcare, household chores) are done.

It takes a little time to learn how to do your own thing when someone is working in your house, but it really can help. My housekeeper is the best thing ever, even though she's only here for 2 hours on Thursdays.

Why can't you both care for this baby you created, and hire someone to watch it?", "> her older son does watch him daily. \n\nIf I had to watch a 1 year old younger sibling Daily for more than the hour between when my school got out and when a parent got home I\u2019d move out ASAP.\n\nWhy is one kid minding the other regularly?

The house would fall apart.", "I would say a mixture of both.", "1. He is 20 years old and does not go to school or work. He doesn't do any chores or even his own laundry. \n2. I personally have never asked him to watch the baby and honestly, I don't like it. \n3. We both care for the baby daily.", "He can say no if he wants.

If I take an honest look at myself I believe that I do use my  downtime productively for the benefit of the family.", "I just caught that you also said you handle night wake-ups as well.  \n\nI think you should sit down with your wife and ask her exactly what the extra 25 hours of time without the toddler are for.  If you are truly sharing the chores/parenting when you are both awake, *and* you are handling the overnights, *and* older son watches the child 2-3 hours while you are sleeping, I don't see how daycare is reasonable at all.  \n\nI could see hiring someone to come a day or two a week during the times you are sleeping if she really wants some time to herself.  But daycare?  Nah.\n\nWhat does she do while the brother is watching?", "I agree, someone to come to the home for a few hours would benefit everyone. While you both feel you contribute and work your own way. Kids are just mentally 24/7 demanding, and no amount of 'I do X, you do Y' scoreboard will change how you both feel. \n\nWhat you may personally find unreasonable, your wife finds reasonable for her mental health.

You\u2019re making her out to look worse to us than she is.\n\nDo you have any idea what the amount of actual free time she has is vs. \u201ctime without the toddler but still doing chores, housework, things for the family, etc.\u201d?", "The times are not adding up. If the baby naps for four hours a day, your older son watches the baby for several hours a day and the baby is asleep by 9pm at night. When exactly is there even time for five hours of day care? What times do you spend with the kid?", "So you have Three dependents on one salary, you\u2019re the sole earner?  Oof.\n\nI\u2019d be suggesting my wife go back to work ASAP and be a dual income family just to avoid that pressure.  Assuming her job brings in more than daycare or a babysitter costs.\n\nHow long has your stepson been living at home with no job and no schooling?  I\u2019m surprised, my parents would have let me stay forever if I was doing one or both, but not if I was jobless and school less.  Unless I had an ongoing medical issue.", "Fair enough. Then that's what you need to talk to your wife about. Though I will add that while you may be feeling like you have almost *too much* personal time, your wife likely feels like she has too little. There may not be a great option in the short term, but it's definitely possible for one of you to feel like their drowning while the other is dying of thirst.", "I agree.
