Some days depending on when our son wakes up I may help with the morning feeding or doing some chores like taking the trash out etc. Other days I go to sleep right away. I typically wake up between 12pm and 2pm. Once I wake up I spend time with my wife and son. I do typical parenting duties/Household chores during this time and I am often alone with my son while my wife does other things. I stay awake until my work shift starts and the process starts over again. \n\n2 or 3 times a week I will go for a run which takes an hour or so. Once a week or 2 I will go for a bike ride with friends. I try to do this while they are sleeping but sometimes I will do this when they are awake.\n\n\r  \nOur son's schedule is pretty consistent. He wakes up between 6:30am and 8am. Normally naps from 10am to 12pm and again from 3pm to 4-5pm. He Typically goes to bed between 8pm and 9:30pm.

Now I am alone for the rest of the night, awake because, that is my schedule. My wife really see's this time I am awake from the time she does to sleep until the next morning as desirable. For me it's not that great. I have to be extremely quiet not wake up anyone. Nothing is open, No friends or family is awake. It's pretty lonely and boring honestly. I would much rather spend time with her and our son. \n\n\r  \nMy wife has proposed putting our son in Daycare for 5 hours a day so that she can have more free time. Before our son was born we decided that he wouldn't go to daycare until he was 2 years old. If there are issues or something bad happening to him we would like him to be able to verbalize the issue. \n\n\r  \nI told my wife I thought it was better for him to be home with us than go to daycare. I also told her I didn't think it made sense for us to pay for daycare if she isn't working. I also asked her \"How many stay at home moms send their kids to daycare\".

It's perfectly understandable and you dismissing her needs isn't cool. She at least deserves a discussion and some understanding. Best laid plans before you have a child can change. Most often do. If it is something you can afford you should definitely consider it or maybe compromise on how much or when it happens.

She needed a lot of time to herself to recharge and was very overwhelmed by the neediness that a small child has. Once her child got a little older (8-9 years old ish) everything started to change and she loved being a mom to her tween/pre-teen/teenage child because she was able to connect with them so much easier.

The big question is who REALLY watched the kid on 2nd shift (after OP is awake and before he started work)? Is she still doing all the work and OP just thinks he\u2019s helping (which is what most Redditers will assume). Or is it like he says, he does the bulk here. If that\u2019s true and she has all that time free, she has more free time. \n\nIt\u2019s possible the reality is that it\u2019s something in between.

Can OP take on 2-3 or so designated days while he\u2019s awake before work to be 100% the default parent so those days are \u201chers?\u201d Or can the other son have specific hours where it\u2019s his responsibility? It sounds like he is unemployed, not in school, and an adult living rent-free so a couple days of childcare responsibilities might be well within reason. Or what about daycare 1 day per week? \n\nOP, you\u2019re NTA. Her request may be unreasonable. But also, really think about if her time is truly free.

Often women feel like the default parent, like you can leave when you want to but she has to ask and owe you in order to go out.", "While you might not get 5hrs of free time but you do have your job. Hear me out:\n\nWith a paying job you usually have a set start and end time, and with some jobs that is predictable where you can count on it being the same every day,\n\nYou get breaks where you know you will be able to sit down and relax, and eat your lunch without having to put it down and go do something else.\n\nYou get to go to the bathroom, in peace, alone, with privacy. And not have to worry about your toddler finding new and inventive ways to hurt himself or to destroy the house.\n\nYou get to talk to adults about adult topics with adult words. It nay seem trivial, but going without interacting with another adult is hard, soo hard.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is there is when you are at home with a kid all day every day it is hard. You have to be constantly present and there is no predictability. Maybe your kid will nap for the full 4hrs and you can clean up after their chaos before they wake up. Or maybe this is going to be a day where they refuse to nap, or nap for a couple hours. Maybe they eat their lunch? Maybe they spill it all over the floor and the walls? Maybe they behave? Maybe they take off their diaper and shit on the floor, even worse the carpet.  \nYou say her son watches your kid on a daily basis but yet say he has refused to do so in the past. So there is an unpredictability there as well.\n\nHaving a set day every week that you can rely on for a break is amazing. You can actually plan stuff and do stuff. That predictability adds a little stability to the chaos.\n\nAnd ffs, that daily free time is probably spent on cleaning, meal planning, meal prep, and other household chores.
