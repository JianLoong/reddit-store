Some days depending on when our son wakes up I may help with the morning feeding or doing some chores like taking the trash out etc. Other days I go to sleep right away. I typically wake up between 12pm and 2pm. Once I wake up I spend time with my wife and son. I do typical parenting duties/Household chores during this time and I am often alone with my son while my wife does other things. I stay awake until my work shift starts and the process starts over again. \n\n2 or 3 times a week I will go for a run which takes an hour or so. Once a week or 2 I will go for a bike ride with friends. I try to do this while they are sleeping but sometimes I will do this when they are awake.\n\n\r  \nOur son's schedule is pretty consistent. He wakes up between 6:30am and 8am. Normally naps from 10am to 12pm and again from 3pm to 4-5pm. He Typically goes to bed between 8pm and 9:30pm.

For me it's not that great. I have to be extremely quiet not wake up anyone. Nothing is open, No friends or family is awake. It's pretty lonely and boring honestly. I would much rather spend time with her and our son. \n\n\r  \nMy wife has proposed putting our son in Daycare for 5 hours a day so that she can have more free time. Before our son was born we decided that he wouldn't go to daycare until he was 2 years old. If there are issues or something bad happening to him we would like him to be able to verbalize the issue. \n\n\r  \nI told my wife I thought it was better for him to be home with us than go to daycare. I also told her I didn't think it made sense for us to pay for daycare if she isn't working. I also asked her \"How many stay at home moms send their kids to daycare\".

It nay seem trivial, but going without interacting with another adult is hard, soo hard.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is there is when you are at home with a kid all day every day it is hard. You have to be constantly present and there is no predictability. Maybe your kid will nap for the full 4hrs and you can clean up after their chaos before they wake up. Or maybe this is going to be a day where they refuse to nap, or nap for a couple hours. Maybe they eat their lunch? Maybe they spill it all over the floor and the walls? Maybe they behave? Maybe they take off their diaper and shit on the floor, even worse the carpet.  \nYou say her son watches your kid on a daily basis but yet say he has refused to do so in the past.

If he's not being paid or it's not something he does in lieu of room and board, I'm not impressed. \n\nThird shift with a family is brutal, and I want to be into NAH territory because you do what you have to to make it work sometimes and it doesn't sound like OP's wife does share in parenting, but I also noticed that OP was able to list things that he enjoys doing in his free time during regular hours with friends etc and he mentioned that she gets to go out to the grocery store with him or \"things of that nature.\" Most of dad's waking time is when the baby is asleep. I didn't read anything about what she does for her own well-being that amount to the runs or bike rides OP takes. OP says she's not working, which matters financially, but she IS working while OP is asleep.\n\nDaycare a couple days a week might be a compromise that's doable?

They are typically 3-4 hours for x number of days a week. I think the church I work at, for that age, is two days a week.

I would hazard a guess it's not so much about not wanting your child around other kids and more about the situations where people's children were found unresponsive and the daycare didn't call EMS because they were afraid it'd be pinned on them, or the situations where children were abused. They definitely need to work out a fair solution for both of them but I'm not even having kids and I don't think I'd ever trust a daycare with a child under five, or a child without good communication skills and a fair sense of suspicion.", "Well, if money is the issue I could see his point .", "All that downvoting and it turns out people didn\u2019t actually realize what they were judging.

I cried at first too, but I don\u2019t think it was for that long. Yikes. You definitely made the right call.", "I need to know more details here, definitely!", "I\u2019m wondering the same. Also, is the equivalent amount of time consistent? Does she have weekly times that she knows she can make plans (or not) and know that the baby is taken care of during that time regardless? Is she able to do this without asking OP to watch the baby when she wants to do something on her own?", "He said an abnormal number of kids die in daycares at his country.

If she\u2019s doing chores, that\u2019s not free time. If she\u2019s playing with your child, that\u2019s not free time. Any time that she is the one solely responsible for keeping your child alive is not free time. Any time you\u2019re both doing it is family time. Your wife is telling you that she needs some time to herself. She needs time for her hobbies or interests. She needs quiet time. Time for self care. She\u2019s parenting for 100% of your child\u2019s awake time. So if your kid is waking up at 6:30 and going to bed at 9, your wife is essentially working 14 hour days, every single day. You pull some of the weight some of the time, but she needs real, actual breaks. The only breaks she\u2019s getting are when the other kid helps out and babysits. \n\nGive your wife a few hours a week where you\u2019re solo parenting. Give her time for the gym or a manicure or just an hour or two where you take your kid out of the house and she gets the house to herself.", "I viewed the nap time as \"engaged to wait time\" at work when I was a SAHM rather than free time. So basically I couldn't just leave the house and go do what I want, I was home with the sleeping baby. Maybe I caught up on chores, maybe I napped, maybe I did my own hobby for a bit. But I wasn't truly free. So similarly if I was at a job and kind of on call to be working, I'd be paid for it. The boss just happened to be a baby instead of middle management.\n\nI think your wife is asking for a better dynamic that doesn't make all of her potential free time in the afternoon when she is likely getting dinner ready for you four rather than having actual freedom.\n\nI'm sure there is some compromise or schedule shift you can do rather than looking at daycare as the first option but even if ultimately you pay a little money so she can have a mental health break a few hours a week, maybe not 5 hours a day but something that works for everyone, then it's probably going to be money well spent for you to get a happier wife", "Genuine question- do you do these things on your own volition and without prompting? I ask because some partners believe they are doing their part, but they are only doing what they are asked to do, putting the work of managing their work on the other partner. That means their partner is effectively doing two jobs, their own share of chores and being their partner\u2019s manager to coordinate the partner\u2019s share of the chores. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s not the case here but the extra mental load sometimes falls on one partner more than another, and that\u2019s exhausting. \n\nCan you two talk through this with a counselor or something? Neither of you sound happy with the current situation.", "You objectively do not, you are asleep throughout the morning and into the afternoon \n\nYou get time out of the house away from your child where you\u2019re not doing labor that benefits the house (your runs and bike rides)\n\nYikes you really do not appreciate what your wife is doing for your home and child", "It's a known phenomenon in psychology that everyone thinks they do the most, even if it's equal, even if it's patently untrue.
