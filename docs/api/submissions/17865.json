Naturally, I let my girlfriend use my towels because she was my guest. She took the bath and then walked out with her hair wrapped in my face towel.

She\u2019s calling me a hypocrite for being ok with my girlfriend using my face towel that I don\u2019t share with anyone on her hair and not seeing an issue with my girlfriend possibly using her toiletries. \n\nThis is ridiculous to me and our parents don\u2019t care about sides and just want the arguing to stop. They\u2019re blaming both of us for \u201cstarting it\u201d depending on their mood. AITA?

That's tricky for sure then, and the best way to address this is by ignoring tf out of her. The second-best way is to tell her that everything she wants is within her reach as long as she works for it. At age 16, she's old enough to push a lawn mower and babysit children. If she's smart, she can tutor kids. I would even recommend giving her this proposal while you were sitting down with her and your parents, so they know what the expectation is. Since they themselves are unwilling to buy her things whenever she wants and have raised you to also be careful with your money, this is probably a plan that will meet with their approval, especially if you bother them up by saying that Mom and Dad instilled these values in you, so they can't reject what you're saying without rejecting the praise of their own parenting.", "Heads up, using fabric softener in the wash or dryer sheets will RUIN your towels. \n\nPut vinegar in the wash to help soften and clean them and use a tennis ball in the dryer to help with drying.", "NTA but just buy your sister some towels so she stfu, then everyone wins.", "ESH I was on your side until you said it was fine that your girlfriend had used your sister\u2019s shampoo/conditioner.

However that being said , the usage of another women's hair product is v sacred lol and Varys product to product . Had someone used my expensive products w/out asking no matter how close I am w/ them , I'd still be pretty ticked off as sad as it is . Your gf has no right to touch another persons belongings , your sister may feel it's just as unsanitary or weird to share her shampoo as you feel it is to share towels .
