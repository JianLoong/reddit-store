Or that she might be using it at times when you end up needing it? Because this is totally fair and just needs communicating.\n\nShe probably sees the car as almost hers at this stage and is just happy to get used to driving it / prefers it to her old car.", "By your own admission you don't really know why you don't want her to use it. It's about to be hers so getting a little experience to adjust to it doesn't sound like a bad idea.\n\nShe doesn't sound entitled as she's seeking permission every time. It also doesn't sound like she's wanting to use it on days that you intend to. \n\nNAH, this doesn't need to be a big argument.", "Is she paying for insurance or is she even covered by your insurance when using YOUR car?  If not you are opening yourself up to the possibility of massive legal and civil charges/fines.  DON'T DO IT!!", "NTA. You were very clear on the terms of her getting your current car. She is the one who\u2019s trying to go against the agreement.", "NAH.\n\nYou said it yourself, you don't understand why you are refusing her, so there's no reason for her not to use the car.\n\nShe is clearly asking every time she wants to borrow it, as opposed to being entitled to the car. As long as you don't need it at the same time there's not a problem, is there?\n\nEDIT : changing from Y T A to NAH. Of course you have every right to deny her use of your car, but without a real reason and given you've let her use the car frequently before, it's tilting towards Y T A.", "NTAH\u2026.barely. In the end it is your car so you can choose when you want someone to use it or not for any reason, no one is entitled to it. That being said I almost want to say your the asshole from reading your reasonings and responses. It\u2019s seems you have no reasons for not letting her use it. I don\u2019t understand your line of thinking on it.", "NTA. \n\nIt's not her car yet.", "NTA you said in a month after your new car was delivered. She is acting entitled and presumptuous and it is no wonder you are annoyed. It has nothing to do with the fact you are not using it there and then. It is like the room mates trying to take over your room when you have got two weeks left on your lease. Family arguing over Granny's possessions while she is still sat there quite hearty. i would rescind your offer, but I am petty.", "NTA, but barely. If you\u2019re not using it why can\u2019t she? By your own words she has a beater, no wonder she\u2019s excited to drive something nice. And she wants to show it off and brag about how awesome you are for giving it to her", "NTA.  She has a car.  Your car is not her car.  She has no reason to start using your car instead of her car.  Has she even offered to sell her old car and give you the money, after you give her your car?

If I was in her shoes, I would like to to so. Well, I have actually driven my partner's car on multiple occasions, and know for sure that I don't want it, even for free, I'd rather buy another second hand car when mine is past justifiable repairs. Unless there are potential insurance problems while you are the registered owner, I don't see a reason for your reluctance.", "INFO: if she would make an accident with your car, would this impact how much your quote is or does she has an insurance that would cover the damage? And do you have an agreement what happens if one of you guys totale the other persons car?", "Yeah I see. I think it's because she has her own and mine is not technically hers yet so the best course of action for me was for her to just wait like month. But now she just doesn't want to use her car anymore which caught me by surprise I thought she would wait", "Thanks no she pays for the gas and only want to use the car when I don't need it. But I guess it's because she still has her car which runs fine so I expected her to wait before using mine as if it's hers. It's a bit weird to explain but there's also the fact that she never wanted to drive my car in the 5 years we've been together, so I was a bit caught by surprise.", "You mean YTA right? Yeah there wasn't any augment she respects my decisions. It's just me who fell a bit like an Ah saying no", "It's just how I would have acted if I were her. I would have waited for the new car to arrive so I expected her to do the same. I told her the car will be all hers for free when my new one arrives implying that in the meantime she just keep using here's like before.\n\nIt's like if I tell you I will give you 1000$ so you ask to borrow 500$ today and 500$next week if that makes sense", "Thank you you get exactly how I'm feeling. I am really happy to give it to her that's no problem at all. And she is very excited to drive it which I totally understand . But she looks for any reason to go use my car instead of hers now (she works part time and I WFH so basically she can use it during the day while I work and there no traffic).\n\nBut as you said she could understand the situation and make the effort to at least wait a bit, insure the car to her name and then drive it all she wants next month.", "I guess there some risk involved. The sedan is bigger than her beater. She could dent it or whatever and it would piss me off because it's still my car. Once I get my new car and give her my old one I won't care if she dents it because it would be her car. But why take the risk now? I get that she is exited but she do not have a lot of time to wait. Basically she waiting on a new exicitng car just like I am.", "In one of the comments, OP says she isn't registered as a secondary driver on his insurance. If there is an accident, it could be extremely expensive.", "Yes she test drove it with me and alone and she likes it a lot.\nMy reluctance is that she want to use my car everyday while she has one. What if she dents it or worse? To me it's not wise for her to want to only use my car instead of hers until I give it to her for good.", "Good I point, I would probably have to lie about who made the accident (which I don't want to do) because she's not registered as a secondary driver on my car insurance. She  never wanted to drive my car in the 5 years we've been together, until I decided to make the new purchase. She's telling she will be careful and stuff but I told her sometimes accidents are not your fault. \nSounds like she doesn't realize how embarrassing it would be for her to get in an accident or even dent the car while it's still legally mine. She just has to wait a month maximum and the car would be all hers. I'm like why take the risk even if it's low?", "Would you rather use a beat up old car or a newer sedan?\n\nOf course she would rather drive the newer nicer car that will soon be hers anyways.\n\nAnd does it really matter if she gets an accidental scratch now or in a month?\n\nNAH", "Why would it be the best course of action for you? \n\n\nIf she does not take the car at times you need it.", "I think her keenness to use the car is just excitement and shows that you did well in offering this generous gift. She likes it a lot - that's fab. Or she's trying it out over a period of time to ensure it's her preferred next car - that's also sensible.\n\nIf you really don't want her to use it until your new car is there I'd just say you want to have a vehicle available to you in case of emergencies. I doubt she'd be opposed to that.", "Tbh if she's only taking it when you don't need it, then your problem with this situation just seems to be a \"principle of the thing\" issue, as you're not actually affected by her taking the car?\n\nI guess I'm wondering if this is a principle you really need to stand on? Sure, it's your car, you should say no if you want. But I guess...why not just be nice? Doesn't sound like it would cost you anything.", "She\u2019s not really using it as if it\u2019s hers though, she\u2019s asking you if she can borrow it. Which shows she knows it\u2019s still yours.", "I think you should probably just let her use the car when you aren't, since you really can't provide a sufficient reason not to. But I don't think it's a big enough issue to go with Y T A. She'll have it in a few weeks anyway.", "Yeah, I would get that if she was using it when you need it or not putting gas in, but like you commented, that isn\u2019t the case. Implying she still uses hers when she needs to. I suppose I don\u2019t get the difference of her using it now, or waiting the month (even if that\u2019s what you would do). I wouldn\u2019t even say waiting would be polite. Even in your theoretical I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with asking for $500 now and the other $500 next week if you were giving me $1,000. Don\u2019t get me wrong, both in the real situation and the theoretical you definitely are in the right to say no, I just don\u2019t get it though.", "That\u2019s a damned good reason. So then that\u2019s why, no?", "That\u2019s a real reason not to, but that should be THE reason. And she should know it, too", "If she dents it or worse, you can drive her old car until you get your new one. It seems like some irrational feeling of ownership, I mean emotionally (legally you are still the owner). Are you sure that once your gf became the registered owner, you will be able to detach yourself from the car? I know people who in such situation would be unhappy if their former car developed a dent. I am not criticising you, just trying to help you figure out your own feelings :)", ">because she's not registered as a secondary driver on my car insurance\n\nThat right there. You either need to add her immediately, or she needs to wait a month. It wouldn't just be embarrassing, it would be illegal and potentially expensive. Insurance looks for reasons not to pay, and if they denied a claim, you would be liable. NTA", "Uh, you may want to fix that. As you've been living together awhile I'd recommend having both people insured on both cars - makes things easier if someone has to unexpectedly drive the other vehicle for whatever reason. \n\nWe now have two cars that are basically communal property, but back when we had our own, we'd borrow each others on occasion (such as the time my car battery died lol. Or when my husband was way too tired to drive).", "What's with all the doubles lol?", "Well I think I'm being very nice by giving her a 2016 car with low mileage for free (she works minium wage part time and could not afford it). \n\nIt's just that the taking the car creates unnecessary risks. She does not insure the car. What if she dents it or damage it or whatever? Do I lie on my insurance so that they can cover ? What if the car gets stolen? I don't want to be paranoid but to me it's not worth the risk. She can use the car all she wants next month when it's hers.\n\nI would understand if she didn't have a car but she has one and pays insurance for it in case anything happens", "Yes honestly I wouldn't care because I'm in love with the new car I bought lol. But I would be very pissed if she's dents it now. The car is very low mileage and mint condition (I WFH). Honestly if I could give it to her and be done with it now I would. But I can't until I have my new car delivered.\nBut everytime she asks for the car (she did after I wrote the post) I'm like \"but you have a car !!\". Honestly I think she's better off waiting and registering the car to her name before using it that much but I realize it's kind of an asshole move because letting her use it now probably won't change my life.", "Bad connection messing up", "Ok. The insurance stuff wasn't in your post. If that's the case it's fair enough to ask her to start paying for insurance now or wait until the handover to use the car.", "Congratulations on your new car! :) But you might want to speak with your gf and explain how you feel, instead of just saying that she has a car. Don't forget to tell her that you love her :) Don't jeopardise your relationship over a soon former car and lack of communication."]}
