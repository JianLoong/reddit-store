We had dinner with some close friends of ours and they asked about if we\u2019ve done any wedding planning yet. The subject of bridal colors came up and my friend asked what my favorite colors are. I said pink and purple. My fianc\u00e9 jumped in and immediately said no to pink because \u201cit looks TERRIBLE on you.\u201d I mentioned that I really like it and lot of my things are pink, and he doubled down and said, \u201cyeah, and it looks bad.\u201d I laughed it off and changed the subject. It\u2019s not like I wanted pink as a bridal color. His comment about how it looks terrible really struck me though.\n\nI know a favorite color isn\u2019t a big deal, so I don\u2019t understand why it bothers me so much. It\u2019s not like I go out in head to toe pink like Elle Woods; I mostly just have pink accessories or accent pieces. I have a pink hoodie I wear often when I\u2019m home, but everything else is other colors. I have some nice blouses that are pink which I wear occasionally. I do have a head to toe work out outfit that\u2019s mostly white with bright pink stripes all over it, but I only wear it when working out occasionally. Pink brings me a bit of joy when I see things like my pink cellphone charger or my purse with pink accents. My cellphone case is pink too though. Not sure how to explain it, but I used to smile at myself after I put on or use something pink because it\u2019s like I could get a standard color, but I choose pink because I can! I thought it was cute at the least. It used to give me tiny moments of cheer. \n\nBut now that\u2019s gone. \n\nI put on a pink hair tie this evening before I went to workout, and instead of smiling at my reflection, I just heard his booming voice telling me, \u201cit looks TERRIBLE on you.\u201d\n\nI asked him again today if he really meant it when he said I look terrible in pink. (I was still wearing the pink hair tie, but nothing else I was wearing was pink.) He said yes, he did still think that and it\u2019s not a problem if I want to wear it or like it, he just personally thinks \u201cit looks really bad.\u201d \n\nI am just so sad and now I look at all the random pink things I have and where they used to bring me happiness, I feel nothing or disdain for them. I have never had anyone express any negativity for my pink things, except when I was in elementary school. Way back then, a bully said my pink backpack was too girly. Somehow that didn\u2019t bother me at all. I actually responded that it was fine and I\u2019m an girl anyways, so even if pink is too girly, I was happy with it. Nowadays, I get compliments that my pink things are unique or cute or even classy yet feminine. I feel so childish being upset by this because it\u2019s such a small issue, it\u2019s my fianc\u00e9\u2019s genuine opinion, and I respect him so much, but part of me is sad and considering getting rid of every pink thing I own since it no longer sparks joy.

Who made your husband the fashion police? Sure there are certain colours that don't suit people but it certainly isn't going to make you 'look terrible'. If it makes you happy, wear it.\n\nAlthough if he suddenly said this during the wedding planning, sounds like he's scared of the colour pink and doesn't want to be associated with it on his wedding.", "NTA.

Your joy shouldn't be reliant on anyone else's opinion, and your BF is the AH for not recognising this. \nI'd suggest talking to him calmly about how his comment made you feel, I don't think he's fully aware of the effect this has had on you, but if he doesn't change his delivery of his opinion then the issue lies with him and not you.\nWear what makes you happy, this world needs more of that.", "> I told him how I feel about this and now he feels bad for sharing his honest opinion.\n\nI was leaning towards N A H, but this part here makes me say NTA. You should be able to tell him how you're feeling, without him making it about him. \n\n*He* feels bad now? Cool. I don't want to hear that. You've already made me feel like crap for what you've said, now my expressing that to you turns into *you* feeling badly? Nope. \n\nThat just tells me I can't express myself to them w/o it turning into how *they* feel.

Umm, this is actually a whole big red flag. The utter disrespect.\n\nEdit: clarity", "NTA - of course it hurts when the person closest to you tells you that you look terrible in something! Especially if it's something you felt comfortable and happy in. A bully saying something looks bad and a partner are two completely different things. I can understand your partner didn't mean to cut you this deep, but it was still a rude thing for him to say. It's as if he thought YOU thought/knew that pink wasn't a flattering colour when you'd never expressed such a thing. It may have been his honest opinion, but it was an inappropriate way to express it, and he could have been kinder.", "NTA - isn't it a little late in the game for negging? What an asshole.", "NTA. Your fiance was an arse. He could've just said he wasn't a fan of pink and stfu or said nothing at all, as he's not the one wearing the dress.\n\nThe way he said it concerns me as much as what he said. That attitude towards a colour like pink, whether from guys or girls, is because the person is trying too hard to be edgy and not \"girly\" and is a definite sign of immaturity.\n\nThat's the best-case scenario. The worst-case is that this is a sign of things to come if you do get married.\n\nI'm a straight guy, I love pink, and purple is my fav colour. However, if I were getting married, I wouldn't care what colour dress she was wearing.\n\nDon't let somebody ruin your love for a particular colour.

He might be completely oblivious to it.\n\nA while back I bought a nice pair of checkered pants and when I showed my husband the first thing he said was 'Where is the rest of your clown's outfit?' He didn't understand why I got upset at that until I explained that I can't even look at the thing now or any other checkered pants ever because his remark made me feel like I'll look like a clown wearing it.

My wedding dress was pink.\n\nDepending on the shade, pink looks good on everyone.

Have you ever seen a happy person and thought \"that color doesn't work for them\"? I bet you haven't, because happiness is the best accessory. So if it makes you happy, wear it. You will look good.", "NTA.No matter if it's just a colour and a small issue, it's still important to you and a person you consider close decided to pretty much leave you with a \"well do what you want, but be aware that I will always see it as a terrible choice I disprove of\", which I can't blame you for getting sad about. Also, you can also use the argument of \"it's childish, that's just a colour\" the other way around - that there was literally no need to use big words like \"terrbile\" on how the guy thinks it suits you.Also, there were tens of other ways to make a comment about not wanting a possible wedding dress to be pink, because that's essentially all that was supposed to be discussed there. I'm also kinda tempted to call your fianc\u00e9 a slight AH here, because despite you communicating you like something and hearing those things hurts you, he still went with it and even claimed that he feels bad because what? You didn't see his opinion of the colour as more valuable than yours and didn't take it as the ultimate truth? And just were affected by the words of a person important to you? That's a normal human reaction to have, far from being oversensitive and irrational.  \nFingers crossed you can still somehow talk it out.", "NTA he is! My guy is ok with me painting a room in our house pink why because I love it! He loves me and move to see me smile!", "If pink brings you joy, wear it. I would ask a friend or beauty professional to help you find your color season. It may be the case that neon pink doesn't work the best on your skin tone, but a softer tone or a more muted one could look great. Most folks can wear most colors and if something doesn't look right it may he off tonally. Your fiance is q bit of an AH for making sweeping proclamations and for being a bit defensive when you told him your feelings on how he's said you look terrible in pink. The cat is out of the bag and you know how he feels. But I wouldn't let that change how you feel about pink. Sometimes small things make folks happy and loving partners let you be happy without harping on. If this is something he continues to bring up, I'd set a boundary with him about giving you fashion opinions.", "No one should make you feel this way. Nothing wrong with sharing an opinion in a productive manner but he didn't. He took joy from you and he will keep doing it. At the table if you was my friend he would of been corrected quickly. Absolutely inconsiderate and you need to work on yourself more.\nWork on yourself and really think about this marriage.", "NTA.\n\nMines red, but I know certain shades don't agree with my skin tone.

Try to remember how good you feel.", "NTA - There is a huge difference in wanting a specific color choice because you like the overall aesthetic of colors A and B vs not choosing Colors P and Q because they don\u2019t look good on someone. \n\nMore importantly there is a thing called TACT (look it up). Even IF OP looks horrendous (and really most people do not look horrible in color\u00e9 outside their \u201ccolor wheel, they just don\u2019t look \u201cbest\u201d) OP\u2019s FI could have gone about it in a variety of ways. \n\nFFS, this was about the wedding colors, OP isn\u2019t even wearing the colors, she\u2019s wearing a shade of white.\n\nFI did this to be mean and only mean.", "Dump him.

Bridal colours are not necessarily a color worn by the bride only. His reaction was weird and not well thought out. He insulted you instead of offering constructive criticism. This is a red flag and something you need to clear the air about before you marry him.

I used to hate it because I kind of wanted one of this one \u201coh no you always look good\u201d guys but now I truly, truly value his honesty. I know I don\u2019t have to agree with it but whether he\u2019s telling me I\u2019m beautiful or he doesn\u2019t like a style of shirt or I did amazing at something, I know he was earnest and there\u2019s no reason to doubt it was a false compliment.\n\nNow there are number of clothing pieces I own that I love that I know he doesn\u2019t. I\u2019ve done hair styles and piercings that he doesn\u2019t think look good on me but I do them anyway because *I* like them. It took me awhile to get to this point because I used to be so sensitive and I cared so much what he thought and I wanted to be beautiful to him. Eventually I realized he does think I\u2019m beautiful even if he doesn\u2019t always like my style but he\u2019s never demanded I do or not do something and I will do what I want to do with my body. Honestly, I think most of my wardrobe at this point isn\u2019t to his taste but it\u2019s mine so who cares?\n\nIf your fianc\u00e9 is the same then I hope you can also reach the point where you wear what you like simple because *you* like it! It\u2019s okay if he doesn\u2019t.

My sons and my Dad are red/green colorblind and most shades of pink look gray, while other looks like a soft low saturated blue.", "NAH not every color it works perfectly with everyone\u2019s skin tone, but also this is one persons opinion. Have you tried asking him specifically what looks so bad? Maybe he just has a problem with the color pink and it isn\u2019t about you in pink at all. But seriously it\u2019s one opinion.\n\nTry to think about it like this, I do not eat seafood I think it is absolutely disgusting. But that doesn\u2019t mean seafood is actually disgusting, most people love to eat lobster.  If you like lobster and I don\u2019t like lobster does that make your lobster taste worse? Because it shouldn\u2019t. You should still fully enjoy that lobster regardless if I like it or not. I also know enough not to yuck someone else\u2019s yum because that\u2019s not nice so I understand it would be difficult for you to enjoy your lobster if the whole time you were eating it I was making derogatory comments, so I understand why you would be weirded out wearing pink in front of him now.\n\nMy advice to you would be to keep enjoying pink, just because he doesn\u2019t like it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad just like lobster isn\u2019t disgusting just because I think it is.\n\nBut also, it would be OK for you to have a conversation with him about offering unsolicited advice. He may not understand the phrase don\u2019t yuck someone else\u2018s yum because I think that\u2019s from someone\u2019s grandmother, but maybe he needs to hear it so he doesn\u2019t piss people off all over the place.\n\nGenerally it\u2019s super rude to comment on someone else\u2019s appearance unless it\u2019s a compliment or unless they ask your opinion. In a partnership situation I do expect my partner to tell me if I look ridiculous even if it hurts my feelings because that\u2019s better than going around looking ridiculous, but that\u2019s not this.", "Did he need to say it like he did - no .

There are a lot of more diplomatic ways he could have told you, besides I\u2019m not really convinced anyone always looks bad in a certain colour anyway.
