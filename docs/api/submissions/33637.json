You paid for the initial bedroom makeover. You were going to pay for new furniture yourself, and your mom offered to help.\n\nIt would be different if you asked your mom to pay for things but you didn't. You were going to yourself and again, she offered.\n\nAnd for those saying to move out on your own: it's a 3-story house and if you're helping your mom and paying for yourself and your daughter, there's nothing wrong with multi-generarional living.", "In the last years of my mom\u2019s life, I did A LOT for her because I lived nearby and could. My siblings didn\u2019t do as much because they lived away and didn\u2019t really have the means. You live with her and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing plenty for her your sister isn\u2019t. Your mom wants to help out-I\u2019m sure it makes her feel good to be able to help even though she\u2019s elderly. As long as you know you\u2019re not taking advantage of her, that\u2019s all that matters. NTA", "NTA - it\u2019s your mother\u2019s money to spend as she chooses and you didn\u2019t ask her to do any of this. It\u2019s possible your mom only spends more because she has more of a relationship and opportunity as Jenny lives with her. Of course, if it\u2019s a situation where the other grandkids are clearly not getting the same number of gifts and whatnot, that feels like favoritism than proximity, so maybe address that, I guess.", "NTA, my mil lives with us, and she loves to spoil her grandchildren. And to be honest, I think I would do the same with our future grandchildren if the finances allow it. \nAnd of course she spends more on the grandchildren she lives with because she seems her needs and wants more.", "Well, your mom is spending money to redecorate her own home, it's not like she's redecorating a room in your house. Having it spruced up might make it more attractive if she ever decides to sell her home. \n\nShe can renovate every bedroom in her house if she wants to. It's none of your sister's business.", "NTA\n\nYour mom has the right to choose to spend her money as she wants.   However; I would expect that the furniture doesn't leave with your daughter.", "I posted this on another community? I\u2019m unsure what you call them but I need to know so I can make things right for Christmas.", "Info: you and your daughter provide care and support in exchange for free rent?", "NTA. your mom can spend her money however she likes. lots of grandmas enjoy spoiling their grandchildren -- you would be an AH to interefere with doing something that makes her happy.", "NTA. Your mom's money, hers to do with as she pleases. Sounds like your sister is just jealous for whatever reason. Tell her she doesn't look good in green and then ignore her nonsense.", "NTA! Your mom is elderly, not incompetent. She can decide to do with her money as she likes. End of story.", "Does Jenny spend a lot of time with her grandma? If she does, I know it\u2019s easier since you live there; then grandma probably just has a special place for her in her heart. As the mom you should keep the favoritism down though. Thank your mom and let her know that the furniture can wait until you have the money. Or if your mom insists just tell Jenny she needs to keep it to a small amount of money. Jenny may not understand how her cousins will see things but some day she will get it. As a mom you will make Jenny a better person for it.", "This could easily be a situation where you are 'accidently' milking mom for stuff.  \n\nWe don't know. There is way too much missing info here. How much money mom has, are you paying to live there, etc. \n\nIf you feel guilty just freaking say no Mom, make your daughter paint the room and keep her old furniture.", "NTA. Your mum can spend her money how she likes. And now she likes to spend it on her granddaughter who is living with her. Nothing wrong with that. Mary can go kick some rocks.", "Is Jenny her only grandchild?", "My nephews lived with my parents for years into their 20s.  My parents paid for everything... private school, clothes food sports.  It really hurt my kids because they couldn't bond with them because nephews ALWAYS came first \nGrandma doesn't realize the damage she is doing.\nMy mom is old now and could use the help since other grandkids took off to live in prison and they are Still her by her actions", "YTA\n\nRather than relocating and redecorating your Mother's home, you should be getting your own.

Ya think by the age of 50 ur sis would be over sibling rivalry.  Unless she worried u spending her inheritance\u2026..", "NTA. If your mom has the money and she\u2019s in her right mind, it\u2019s hers to do with. Your sister sees her inheritance being spent.", "NTA. It sounds like your mom willingly offered to help out with the furniture, and if Jenny is happy, that's what matters. Family dynamics vary, and it's not your sister's place to judge. If your mom is content with her choices, there's no need to feel guilty.", "QUESTION: Does your mother have ALL her marbles? Does she manage her own money and have money saved for her late-life care?", "I would say NTA but you should be aware of how it looks to your sibling and the other grandkids and maybe try and think how you'd feel if it was happening the other way round, the problem with playing favourites is someone else misses out, often unjustly.", "NTA. It\u2019s your mom\u2019s money. She can spend it on what she wants.", "NTA. None of Mary's business, and your mom should tell her so.", "This is pretty optimal in many cultures. Americans need to do this more IMO.", "Having worked with elderly people the biggest thing many of them like is having company and care just the fact that she has family nearby is a great help for her", "I dunno that I'd label it favouritism in this case though. It sounds more like OP moved in with her mother to help and mum is doing what she can by buying gifts for her granddaughter to repay the favor. It might feel like favouritism if you're another family member but if they stopped to look at the whole picture it seems much fairer.", "Look, you're helping your mom. And I assume paying your share of the bills. Your mom wants to give you something back I guess. How many hours do you spend helping your mom compared to your sister? Is it fair that you spend more of your time helping your mom? It's not, but you chose to put off your own free will. And your mom is happy with the help. Now your mom wants to help you and your daughter, no one is making her. So I don't know why your sister has got her panties in a twist. \n\nYour real problem is that you want to be on good terms with your sister. I think she might actually be feeling guilty about you helping more and jealous that your daughter probably had the closest bond with grandma out of all grandchildren. These are her feelings to work through. It's not something you can help her with. What you can do is have an open and honest conversation. Tell her you hate being at odds and you want to talk about why it escalated to shouting.", "There's nothing you can do. You're not forcing your mom to do anything and you're not begging her to do it.\n\nMy mom is completely crazy with my daughter. She's the only grandchild. I can't say even say \"Blah needs new pants\" without having my mom bring me all sorts of pants that she went to buy for my kid. When I wanted to redo her room, my mother wanted to come with me because she needed something from the store and I had to fight to pay for things. \n\nI tried to explain to her that most of the things she buys were not necessary, because my mom isn't rich and she should enjoy her money at her age but she looked at me like I had offended her. \n\nThe only thing I can control is that my daughter doesn't take advantage of that.", "Yes. I help my mom with chores around the house and bring her to hospital appointments.", "OP should tell the sister if she gets divorced she can move in also.", "So she gives you approximately a 2 bedroom apartment in exchange for those services. In my area that\u2019s about $2200/month. If you work 40 hours a week thats less than minimum wage. And zero bonuses or healthcare. Your family probably needs to pay for to supplement that wage, not ask for free stuff.", "You do know that not all families work on a transactional basis, right? That some of them just help each other out because they love each other?  \n\n\nAlso, to hire someone to do those things might be more expensive than you think.", "They never asked she offered you can clearly read this in post. Mom was going to buy after saving money for decorating her daughter\u2019s room. She is asking for advice not judgement.", "I don\u2019t read when the first sentence is rude. We will not be continuing this conversation.", "I wasn\u2019t going to downvote you until I read this."]}
