You're not an asshole for doing something age-appropriate that your daughter enjoyed, he's not an asshole for thinking 8 is a bit young for this kind of thing. \n\nBut you guys do need to communicate better about these issues. You should've told your husband you were doing your daughter's makeup for the dinner, for example, so that this conversation could've taken place before the fact and not after. \n\nIt might not me a big deal, but you should always look for consensus in child-rearing issues, or at the very least make sure the other is informed and not firmly opposed.", "NTA I do think you should have talked to dad about it beforehand.

Of course, to me the over the top stuff at pageants making a 2 yo look like they are 25 is gross, but just an observation.", "NTA. My son is the same age and loves having his nails painted and I'd never ask my husband's permission to paint them. It comes off.

It's good he didn't say anything in front of her, making it a bigger deal than necessary.", "NAH. No one is the asshole here, everyone handled the situation appropriately, however I agree that makeup should probably be an at-home thing.\n\nMy mom kept a special lip gloss in her purse when I was little and constantly begging for makeup and this was what I was allowed to wear when I was out. Maybe speak with your husband about doing something like that? It\u2019s harmless, doesn\u2019t grab attention and will most likely come off when she\u2019s eating/playing anyway.", "NTA.

I tend to agree with your husband on the basic issue, but I don't think either position is unreasonable.", "NTA. You put a little makeup on her for a special outing with family. She loved it, and when she\u2019s an adult, she\u2019ll fondly remember spending the time getting ready with you. Why is your husband being so weird about it?", "Personally I think kids grow up way too fast nowadays even without parental encouragement. She doesn't need make up (most women don't NEED it but I do get that plenty feel more confident/feminine/whatever with a bit of warpaint :) ). Your husband is not trying to control her, he is giving a strong and loving message by saying she's beautiful as she is.", "NTA. Nothing wrong with dress up. As long as it's not trashy.

You should have a discussion about when you\u2019re going to start letting your daughter wear makeup, however.", "NTA. Make up is a form of self expression. I don\u2019t think it would be very appropriate to have her go out wearing a full face, but if it\u2019s just blue eyeshadow and light make up for a special occasion I don\u2019t see the big deal. When I was a kid I used to have these big make-up bags (idk if this is the right word) that my parents would buy at the toystore and my friends and I had so much fun with it! (Tho we mostly used this at home)", "NTA this gave weird vibes", "YTA. Makeup is not for children and is a decision both parents need to make.", "NTA. You *maybe* should have mentioned it to your husband, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a young girl trying out makeup with their mom if they want to!", "NTA. Am I correct to assume most of the makeup was for \"dramatic\"/\"colorful\" features? Because that sounds like what an 8 year old girly girl would want. Sparkles and color. You didn't force her to wear the makeup and I'm certain you weren't telling her she's ugly without or or \"looks better\" with it on. \n\nAnd I do think it's wrong of your husband to tell her she looks prettier natural. He should be supportive of how SHE wants herself to look and ask her what she likes about the makeup. Try to actually get to know his kid and her interests instead of imposing how he wants her to look for his own comfort.", "ESH but leaning heavily towards NTA. I agree, its very minor and realistically he shouldn't be concerned about it as it's her choice more than yours or his.

My mother only put the most expensive makeup off limits because I sometimes ended up damaging it while playing.  To go out, my mom bought me my own makeup that consisted of lip gloss of different shades and transparent mascara since using makeup on young skin is not the best idea.

Those consisted of eyeshadow and lip gloss (sometimes a bit of blush). I think it\u2019s fine for an 8 yr old to wear that type of makeup. But any contour, bronzer, or anything that can change the appearance of facial structures isn\u2019t so good. Let your daughter learn to love the features she was born with. Mascara, foundation, concealer, highlighter, and all of that stuff can come later in high school. False lashes maybe in high school, but you can decide that. I personally only wear concealer (to cover pimples and eye bags), blush, mascara, and lip gloss.", "NAH\n\nI understand his stance - I do think 8 is very young to be wearing make up for a social occasion (as opposed to for a dance or acting show) \n\nBut I do appreciate this is something she wanted, and that you made it age appropriate \n\nI think the two of you need to make sure you\u2019re on the same page and then communicate that to her. Bear in mind she might want other things over the next few years that she also is not old enough for - like social media (that often has an age limit dictated by the company about how old users need to be to have an account), high heels, her own make up, alcohol, a mobile phone, etc etc etc \n\nSome of those are much bigger things than just doing some eyeshadow for a family meal but if you start a precedent of 1) her dad doesn\u2019t get a say/his opinion doesn\u2019t matter 2) if one parent says no the other is still worth asking and might give in and 3) asking enough times will result in her getting her own way despite an initial \u201cno\u201d\n\nThe specific situation is one thing - and a one off isn\u2019t going to cause issues but it\u2019s worth considering with your husband and discussing an agreed approach and also being sure about those rules together so your daughter gets the same answer from both parents and there\u2019s no playing one off the other", "Nah. A lot of people don't like putting make up in kids because it's kinda weird, and making them adult before their time, and also want to build confidence on their natural look before they reach the age where they experiment with their own look more, however, lots of little girls want to play with make up, and you were just letting her do so in a safe and supervised manner.", "NAH. I don't think there's anything wrong with, for fun and because the child wants to, using makeup for a kid. My daughter is 6 and loves playing with stuff like nail polish, having her hair braided, and using ridiculous blushers and stuff. She also likes using actual face paints and does things like flowers on her forehead. She acts age appropriate when she's doing so, so I don't see anything wrong with it. In the same way I don't think OP is TA for doing that for fun either.\n\nI do think OP's husband wasn't TA for bringing it up, privately, with OP out of earshot of their daughter. It can be difficult (speaking as a man myself) to know intuitively what is okay and what isn't. In my experience a lot of men are brought up to think of makeup as something women use to look attractive in a certain way, and they find it hard to see their child as acting in that way.

(my daughter is 7) but I feel like if he is uncomfortable with her wearing it in public that's fine but it shouldn't hurt for her to wear it in the comfort of your home as long as you guys are letting her know that makeup is not a necessity and that she is beautiful without it.", "This raises the question of what make-up means.

Personally I have changed stances.  I originally thought it was important to love yourself for yourself and makeup hides that.  This made me very anti makeup.  Didn't really believe the people that said the makeup is for themselves.\n\nI have since had a change of heart.  Light makeup is not particularly noticeable and seems to bring many people self confidence.  It's really no different than wearing a nice shirt or a watch etc. \n\n My current stance is special occasions or just for fun at home and keeping it light doesn't hurt and teaches a life skill.  I also don't want makeup to become a forbidden fruit type thing.", "NTA... she probably sees mommy wearing make up and wants to dress up too. For just a special occasion like this and it sounds age appropriate she just wanted to have fun like mom. The dad has an odd veiw about makeup.

It\u2019s fun and completely harmless as long as the products are safe (I personally wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with an 8 year old wearing mascara because it could damage their eyes).\n\nI genuinely would like to know why people feel there should be an age requirement. Most women i know don\u2019t wear makeup because they are ashamed of their bare face and as long as it\u2019s discussed from the perspective of fun and creativity, it\u2019s not harming self esteem. The only other argument I can even think of is that it\u2019s potentially sexualizing the child, which is a disgusting argument. If a little bit of eye shadow and glitter makes someone attracted to an 8 year old, the eye shadow and glitter aren\u2019t the problem.", "NTA.
