I don't think either of you is wrong; they're just different ways of looking at the matter. You're not an asshole for doing something age-appropriate that your daughter enjoyed, he's not an asshole for thinking 8 is a bit young for this kind of thing. \n\nBut you guys do need to communicate better about these issues. You should've told your husband you were doing your daughter's makeup for the dinner, for example, so that this conversation could've taken place before the fact and not after. \n\nIt might not me a big deal, but you should always look for consensus in child-rearing issues, or at the very least make sure the other is informed and not firmly opposed.", "NTA I do think you should have talked to dad about it beforehand. Many years ago I would paint little cousins nails and I recall playing in makeup in the early 70s. Of course, to me the over the top stuff at pageants making a 2 yo look like they are 25 is gross, but just an observation.", "NTA. My son is the same age and loves having his nails painted and I'd never ask my husband's permission to paint them. It comes off. But if he asked to have his ears pierced or something permanent we would talk about it first.", "I think if you were doing this EVERY single time then it would be an issue, but you did it once and it was for a occasion, I think that is OK. NTA", "NAH. If his concern is that she is too young, I agree. But I also think if you did as you described, light and tasteful, there isn't any harm in it. It's good he didn't say anything in front of her, making it a bigger deal than necessary.", "NTA. No one is the asshole here, everyone handled the situation appropriately, however I agree that makeup should probably be an at-home thing.\n\nMy mom kept a special lip gloss in her purse when I was little and constantly begging for makeup and this was what I was allowed to wear when I was out. Maybe speak with your husband about doing something like that? It\u2019s harmless, doesn\u2019t grab attention and will most likely come off when she\u2019s eating/playing anyway.", "NTA. This is a great opportunity to teach your daughter about bodily autonomy and that she can wear makeup if she wants to, no matter what other people in her life might think.\n\nAs for your husband, it's a great opportunity to teach him that he doesn't get to dictate what women do or don't do with their bodies.", "NAH.  I tend to agree with your husband on the basic issue, but I don't think either position is unreasonable.", "NTA. You put a little makeup on her for a special outing with family. She loved it, and when she\u2019s an adult, she\u2019ll fondly remember spending the time getting ready with you. Why is your husband being so weird about it?", "Personally I think kids grow up way too fast nowadays even without parental encouragement. She doesn't need make up (most women don't NEED it but I do get that plenty feel more confident/feminine/whatever with a bit of warpaint :) ). Your husband is not trying to control her, he is giving a strong and loving message by saying she's beautiful as she is.", "NTA. Nothing wrong with dress up. As long as it's not trashy. From the way you wrote she looked good.", "Gentle YTA\n\nI don't think there is anything particularly wrong with allowing your daughter to wear some makeup for this special occasion and it sounds like you had a bonding experience... BUT the decision on what age to allow her to start wearing makeup is one you and your husband should have made *together.*", "NTA\u2014 while I do agree you and your husband need to get on the same page, there\u2019s nothing inherently good or bad about wearing makeup.", "NTA. She\u2019s a child & wanted a little magic.", "Imo an 8 yo playing in makeup is for at home. Not for going out to dinner. YTA", "YTA. Deciding the appropriate age for a child to start wearing makeup in public is a decision both parents should have input on. You made a unilateral decision and your partner doesn\u2019t agree with it.", "I\u2019ll say NTA. It sounds like you didn\u2019t communicate about this ahead of time, and you both handled the situation well. You should have a discussion about when you\u2019re going to start letting your daughter wear makeup, however.", "NTA. Make up is a form of self expression. I don\u2019t think it would be very appropriate to have her go out wearing a full face, but if it\u2019s just blue eyeshadow and light make up for a special occasion I don\u2019t see the big deal. When I was a kid I used to have these big make-up bags (idk if this is the right word) that my parents would buy at the toystore and my friends and I had so much fun with it! (Tho we mostly used this at home)", "NTA this gave weird vibes", "YTA. Makeup is not for children and is a decision both parents need to make.", "NTA. You *maybe* should have mentioned it to your husband, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a young girl trying out makeup with their mom if they want to!", "NTA. Am I correct to assume most of the makeup was for \"dramatic\"/\"colorful\" features? Because that sounds like what an 8 year old girly girl would want. Sparkles and color. You didn't force her to wear the makeup and I'm certain you weren't telling her she's ugly without or or \"looks better\" with it on. \n\nAnd I do think it's wrong of your husband to tell her she looks prettier natural. He should be supportive of how SHE wants herself to look and ask her what she likes about the makeup. Try to actually get to know his kid and her interests instead of imposing how he wants her to look for his own comfort.", "ESH but leaning heavily towards NTA. I agree, its very minor and realistically he shouldn't be concerned about it as it's her choice more than yours or his. BUTTTT, it wouldn't have hurt to at least inform him so he wasn't caught off guard.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mother only put the most expensive makeup off limits because I sometimes ended up damaging it while playing.  To go out, my mom bought me my own makeup that consisted of lip gloss of different shades and transparent mascara since using makeup on young skin is not the best idea.  If your daughter likes to put on makeup, you could give her lip gloss, it's usually enough for girls, there are also toys where girls can create their own lip gloss, it's quite fun.", "NAH.  You have different viewpoints,  which is inevitable when parenting. \nA decision was made on the spot, which is life, not everything has to have a discussion before action. \nYou managed to discuss it in what reads as a reasonable manner, afterwards.\n\nWould a compromise of makeup only for special occasions (parties) work?", "(No one is the asshole here is voted as \"n a h\" for \"no assholes here\" if you want to change your vote to that)", "This is a truly awful take. The father wasn\u2019t dictating, he was making sure his daughter felt secure in her own body. NAH. Except maybe you.", "He isn\u2019t being weird he just wants his daughter to grow up loving her true natural self and not the one behind makeup", "You don't learn to swim by being thrown in the deep end though. If her interest persists at some point she'll be allowed, better to ease her into it. NTA", "Agreed. I was thinking as long as she didn't do the whole foundation thing and did a very light look, it's fine.", "How so?", "\ud83e\udd23 you get make up for kids. If the child wants to wear make up she can wear make up.", "Nobody is saying we should let an 8 year old contour their face, but little kids think makeup is super fun and want to look like mommy (or dad), letting them feel like they\u2019re \u2018doing makeup\u2019 by doing a little blush, tinted chapstick or lipgloss, and maybe shimmery eye shadow isn\u2019t a big deal. Perhaps some parents would r feel comfortable with any of that, but it\u2019s not toddlers in tiaras to let you get kids dip their toes in such things.", "Makeup isn\u2019t always about being insecure. Makeup is fun. It\u2019s art on your face. It\u2019s colors and sparkle, especially to a young girl. Makeup isn\u2019t what gave me body issues - the media, other kids, and society gave me insecurity. Makeup is just a way I practice self care and express myself", "He\u2019s telling her she\u2019s not allowed to wear stuff that she wants to. That\u2019s not making her secure in her body, that\u2019s telling her she doesn\u2019t have a right to her own body.", "I like my face as it is just fine, but I still also think it\u2019s fun to put on makeup and dress up. Those two things are not mutually exclusive, and she can learn to love both.", "Well heck, by that argument, why wear clothes?", "Just seems kind of funny that over dinner he decided it wasnt a good idea. Was there any reason?", "I get that, but I just genuinely believe the father was concerned his child was too young to be playing grown up out in public. And I get his concerns. He didn\u2019t lash out, just expressed his concern which he has every right to do. All kids love dressing up, just usually in the privacy of their own homes or maybe at sleepovers etc. He wasn\u2019t trying to police his daughter\u2019s body. \n\nIt would be more concerning if the father encouraged his daughter to wear makeup and dress up formally. Let kids be kids.", "Great point! We should all love our natural selves more instead of hiding behind clothes.", "It sounds like he was opting not to fight in front of the kid and make her feel bad."]}
