You're not an asshole for doing something age-appropriate that your daughter enjoyed, he's not an asshole for thinking 8 is a bit young for this kind of thing. \n\nBut you guys do need to communicate better about these issues. You should've told your husband you were doing your daughter's makeup for the dinner, for example, so that this conversation could've taken place before the fact and not after. \n\nIt might not me a big deal, but you should always look for consensus in child-rearing issues, or at the very least make sure the other is informed and not firmly opposed.", "NTA I do think you should have talked to dad about it beforehand.

No one is the asshole here, everyone handled the situation appropriately, however I agree that makeup should probably be an at-home thing.\n\nMy mom kept a special lip gloss in her purse when I was little and constantly begging for makeup and this was what I was allowed to wear when I was out. Maybe speak with your husband about doing something like that? It\u2019s harmless, doesn\u2019t grab attention and will most likely come off when she\u2019s eating/playing anyway.", "NTA.

I tend to agree with your husband on the basic issue, but I don't think either position is unreasonable.", "NTA. You put a little makeup on her for a special outing with family. She loved it, and when she\u2019s an adult, she\u2019ll fondly remember spending the time getting ready with you. Why is your husband being so weird about it?", "Personally I think kids grow up way too fast nowadays even without parental encouragement. She doesn't need make up (most women don't NEED it but I do get that plenty feel more confident/feminine/whatever with a bit of warpaint :) ).

You should have a discussion about when you\u2019re going to start letting your daughter wear makeup, however.", "NTA. Make up is a form of self expression. I don\u2019t think it would be very appropriate to have her go out wearing a full face, but if it\u2019s just blue eyeshadow and light make up for a special occasion I don\u2019t see the big deal.

You *maybe* should have mentioned it to your husband, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a young girl trying out makeup with their mom if they want to!", "NTA. Am I correct to assume most of the makeup was for \"dramatic\"/\"colorful\" features? Because that sounds like what an 8 year old girly girl would want. Sparkles and color. You didn't force her to wear the makeup and I'm certain you weren't telling her she's ugly without or or \"looks better\" with it on. \n\nAnd I do think it's wrong of your husband to tell her she looks prettier natural. He should be supportive of how SHE wants herself to look and ask her what she likes about the makeup. Try to actually get to know his kid and her interests instead of imposing how he wants her to look for his own comfort.", "ESH but leaning heavily towards NTA.

But any contour, bronzer, or anything that can change the appearance of facial structures isn\u2019t so good. Let your daughter learn to love the features she was born with. Mascara, foundation, concealer, highlighter, and all of that stuff can come later in high school. False lashes maybe in high school, but you can decide that.

A lot of people don't like putting make up in kids because it's kinda weird, and making them adult before their time, and also want to build confidence on their natural look before they reach the age where they experiment with their own look more, however, lots of little girls want to play with make up, and you were just letting her do so in a safe and supervised manner.", "NAH. I don't think there's anything wrong with, for fun and because the child wants to, using makeup for a kid. My daughter is 6 and loves playing with stuff like nail polish, having her hair braided, and using ridiculous blushers and stuff. She also likes using actual face paints and does things like flowers on her forehead. She acts age appropriate when she's doing so, so I don't see anything wrong with it. In the same way I don't think OP is TA for doing that for fun either.\n\nI do think OP's husband wasn't TA for bringing it up, privately, with OP out of earshot of their daughter. It can be difficult (speaking as a man myself) to know intuitively what is okay and what isn't. In my experience a lot of men are brought up to think of makeup as something women use to look attractive in a certain way, and they find it hard to see their child as acting in that way.

(my daughter is 7) but I feel like if he is uncomfortable with her wearing it in public that's fine but it shouldn't hurt for her to wear it in the comfort of your home as long as you guys are letting her know that makeup is not a necessity and that she is beautiful without it.", "This raises the question of what make-up means.

Personally I have changed stances.  I originally thought it was important to love yourself for yourself and makeup hides that.  This made me very anti makeup.  Didn't really believe the people that said the makeup is for themselves.\n\nI have since had a change of heart.  Light makeup is not particularly noticeable and seems to bring many people self confidence.  It's really no different than wearing a nice shirt or a watch etc. \n\n My current stance is special occasions or just for fun at home and keeping it light doesn't hurt and teaches a life skill.  I also don't want makeup to become a forbidden fruit type thing.", "NTA... she probably sees mommy wearing make up and wants to dress up too.

It\u2019s fun and completely harmless as long as the products are safe (I personally wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with an 8 year old wearing mascara because it could damage their eyes).\n\nI genuinely would like to know why people feel there should be an age requirement. Most women i know don\u2019t wear makeup because they are ashamed of their bare face and as long as it\u2019s discussed from the perspective of fun and creativity, it\u2019s not harming self esteem. The only other argument I can even think of is that it\u2019s potentially sexualizing the child, which is a disgusting argument. If a little bit of eye shadow and glitter makes someone attracted to an 8 year old, the eye shadow and glitter aren\u2019t the problem.", "NTA.

I personally see no harm in a kid playing with make up girl or boy.", "NAH.  I'm leaning toward supporting your stance over his though.   An 8-year-old is able to determine what she wants and likes, and makeup is a harmless form of self-expression.  I personally disagree with putting an age (or gender) restriction on it.  A lot of people needlessly sexualize wearing makeup, as if it's only for women who are trying to attract a partner.", "NTA.\n\nShe's exploring herself, makeup is part of that. She needs to know that women are beautiful with and without makeup, that it's a choice she gets to make when she's older but for now mom and dad will have the last say as to when it's appropriate.\n\nIf she's got an interest, letting her explore it at home is the best way to start. It's fun to dress up and go out, though. My kids always loved to dress to the nines to go to the movies. So that was an occasion that my daughter (who was your child's age at the time ) was allowed to wear it out of the house.\n\nYou and your husband need to talk about what your boundaries are with this, as it's an issue that's here to stay for awhile.", "NAH - but a conversation with your husband and compromise is in order, also with your daughter.  I like the lip gloss idea, or at home for dress up.\n\nMy mom put us in a church that didn't allow make-up - except for things like facepainting.  One year I was the face painter at the fair and don't you know - almost every little girl wanted to 'look like cinderella' which was red lips, blush, blue eyelids.  \n\nWith gender as a performance, it's fine to let the kids play and see what hits and what lands.  Of course, the worry with little girls out in public IS The danger of the male gaze, and so much more sexualization that can occur.", "NTA, I wouldn't regularly for an 8 year old but once in a while for fun for dressing up is no big deal.  My 2 and 4 year like having their nails painted, it weirded my husband out a little at first but I always have m nails done and they like being like mommy and they have kids nail polish that usually comes off in the bath so last a day or two maybe. I would let her wear it occasionally for special dinners with the family or other dress up times, why not.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s healthier to introduce makeup as an occasional dress up/artistic activity (like wearing blue eye shadow because we like blue) vs banning it altogether. That just enforces the idea that makeup is to make you prettier for other people and nothing else. \n\nShe\u2019s gonna learn about and experiment with makeup, you may as well frame it in the healthiest way possible. \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t use anything like foundation, concealer, contour etc on a child - but a little eyeshadow and blush for fun color once in a while is fine.", "NAH. You have differing views and that's fine.\n\nThe only thing I would add is to pay close attention to which products you use on her; kids can have very sensitive skin, and you want to know what she reacted to.\n\nMy dad forbid us from wearing makeup until we were at least 12. I used to love wearing it but the hormones of my first pregnancy made my already ridiculously sensitive skin even worse. My eyelids swell if I wear eye shadow or eye-liner, the follicles of my eyelashes itch like hell from mascara, and it triggers migraines. Metallics are the worst but I haven't found any that I'm completely unreactive to.", "Not gonna call you an AH but I don't care for makeup on children either.", "\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\n\nSo why post on Am I the ASSHOLE?", "NAH, seems like harmless bonding between mother and daughter to me. Your husband has a different view on it, and likely some biases that you don't,  but neither point is inherently wrong.", "As long as she's having fun, go for it. NTA", "Nah", "NTA y\u2019all were just having fun!", "NTA. She wanted to try out makeup. It isn't a big deal. It's no different from wanting to play dress-up at that age.", "NTA \n\nI wouldn\u2019t allow an 8 year old to wear that type of makeup out and about but eh! It wasn\u2019t bad at all. I would have let husband know but again, eh. \n\nYour husband needs to steer VERY clear of \u201cyou look better without x\u201d. He doesn\u2019t get to push any preference there or make judgements. Yes, it matters that he\u2019s a man. Men often feel entitled to make these comments and it comes from an old fashioned place of \u201cmen\u2019s opinions on a woman\u2019s appearance matter most\u201d. \n\nJust need to be aware of the nuance and subtleties here.", "NAH. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of your husbands words cause it\u2019s typically used by men who see makeup as women being insecure, rather than using it as a form of self expression. If I was you I\u2019d ask that he doesn\u2019t use that phrase in the future as it could come across to your daughter that her dad thinks she\u2019s insecure about her appearance.", "NTA - I have an 8 year old and she loves playing with makeup. I don't wear it often so when she sees me put some one she asks for some too. It's just for fun and it's clearly not something you're trying to force her in to. I think it's a bit odd your H thinks she shouldn't be allowed to wear it again; her body her choice.", "NTA\n\nMake can be a fun way for kids to express themselves. If she's interested, let her. It's honestly no different than putting on a sparkly tutu. Don't give her a hang up over makeup- let her explore.", "NTA. I used to do my oldest makeup when we\u2019d go out just for fun. My rule is she still had to look like a little girl. Now she\u2019s older and I\u2019m teaching her age appropriate make up. \n\nHer dad even though we split when she was 3, never had an issue with it either since he knew she would beg.", "Asking people on AITA to not be dramatic is like asking a fire to not be hot.", "Yta", "How does blue eyes and light make-up match?", "NTA.  The daughter is playing dress-up, it's a harmless and fun.", "I think, since he told her that she was even more beautiful without makeup, he's worried about her self-esteem, which I think is completely reasonable. Do whatever you want with your own body, but makeup culture can be kind of toxic.", "I believe only the daughter's opinion matters. I don't wear makeup as an adult because the one time my mom let me wear makeup, my father screamed at us and said I looked like a whore. I don't wear it not because I think I look better without it, but because I was forced to grow up thinking that wearing makeup was something only \"bad women\" did.", "Yeah as a kid, I was only given makeup for dress up play. Same as heels. I had little Disney princess eyeshadow palettes, stuff like that. \n\nPersonally, I think a kid should only be allowed real makeup when they're old enough to be trusted to wash their face properly at the end of the day, without help. And obviously keep the makeup clean and not break it. (Edit: And to not rub their eyes accidentally. And to not share with friends. I know when i was 13ish wearing eyeliner, id get styes all the time because i shared with friends, couldnt keep my hands off my face or remember to wash it off correctly.) 8 is too young.\n\nI think you're right that lip gloss might be an age appropriate compromise. Hard to break, cheap, will wash off easily, if it doest come off on its own. \n\nMaybe OP and her husband should talk thru the specifics of when the right time is, if not now.", "Yeah, I had a makeup set as a kid that was just like lip gloss and stuff for play, not real makeup. I barely wear makeup as an adult, I just liked to play dress up. Something like that might be a nice compromise - allowing her to have something like that, or buy some fun lip balms (I had a big lip smackers collection) to allow for some fun but not have a kid be wearing a full makeup look.", "By his comment IMO he doesn't want her to feel like makeup is what makes her beautiful.", "I do agree I think letting kids wear makeup to a reasonable extent is perfect fine.", "Also, if your kid is curious about makeup, it's better to teach them *how* to apply it.\n\nI can't relate to all the memes about girls in the '00s having foundation 10 times darker than their skin because my mom made me get foundation matching at the makeup counter. I also saw too many of my friends get gnarly infections from borrowing makeup/using expired makeup because their parents wouldn't let them buy it.", "Just curious on who\u2019s side people would be on?", "That\u2019s the phrase that honestly makes me the most uncomfortable because it\u2019s one I\u2019ve never been told without a heaping dose of misogyny.  Especially when I was doing my makeup every day and my more natural but more time consuming looks were considered \u201cno makeup\u201d and the ones that are a bit more fantastical that I did just for me were the ones that got that comment.  It just comes off as a way to police woman\u2019s self expression rather than a way to help their self-esteem.  It\u2019s still an insult just wrapped in a silk scarf.", "It can and it can't, depending on how it's handled. My niece loves rainbows and big puffy dresses and says she wants to be David Bowie when she grows up so I will do zany colors on her face and let her wear my fun-colored wigs. It makes her feel special and pretty so why not?", "I remember a conversation that I had with one of my nieces when she was around 6? I think it was. I disliked her mother very much for reasons that I'm not gonna bother explaining but one rule I had was never bad mouth the parents in front of the kids. My SIL put makeup on my niece at 5, not for school or stuff like that but just having fun around the house. I wasn't sure whether it was a good idea to introduce something like that at such an early age, but not my child and not my choice. Never brought it up, until one day when my niece came over for a sleepover at my place. I got her fed and in her PJ's we watched her favourite film (urgh Frozen) and then I read her a story book settled down for the night. The next morning she's freaking out, tears screaming the lot. I eventually figure out that she left some makeup that she wanted to bring at home. I explain to her that it's going to be a day outside running in the park, jumping in puddles, kicking footballs around, basically kids stuff that she has always loved before, so she would probably have it washed off when we got back and she had a bath to clean up. She then said \"I'm not pretty without my makeup\" and continued to sob her heart out. That attitude in such a young beautiful lovely young girl (even if she was a little rascal at times) broke my heart. It was the one time I suggested the mother maybe have a chat to her about it.", "I am so sorry your father screamed at you like that and made you feel so terrible.\n\nOn the other hand, when a kid as young as 8 wants to wear makeup in public, I think that's an area where the adults opinions do matter (neither OP nor the dad seem abusive to me, unlike your situation). Kids often want to do what they see adults doing because it's adult/cool/desireable and they want the benefits, even if they do not understand the costs of those benefits.\n\n8 years old is on the young side to be saying \"I understand that modern beauty standards are a product of both the patriarchy and also individual agency, and I am going to take the agency part and leave the patriarchy.\"\n\nActually, saying it that way makes me feel like there should be a minimum age for actual makeup, so the individual is mature enough to genuinely understand the various social valences and make a truly informed decision. Not going to happen any time soon, obviously, but it would be an interesting thought exercise. No modification of your image and thus your perception of self unless and until you understand why you want to beyond \"everyone else does\" or \"I want to look good.\" (edit, obviously this gets slippery slope real fast and would be weilded as a weapon against trans kids, for example, but there is a real lack of informed consent when it comes to women learning to perform acceptable femininity in our culture).", "That's my thought on makeup too.\n\nInstead of giving mine play makeup, I have a single gloss and encourage them to wash their faces. There are also light face care masks. I have a basket of them and when I do a facial mask, sometimes the girls join me. It seems to satisfy the makeup itch.", "Yeah, I think a basic lip gloss is a reasonable compromise. There are a ton of kids\u2019 ones that don\u2019t do much more than add a bit of shimmer. Totally appropriate for an 8 year old.", "Omg lip smackers, yes! I forgot about those.", "yes! Never borrow makeup the eye infections are the worst I worked for an optometrist for a time and they were just so gross. Plus you should clean your makeup too with alcohol imo.", "My true natural self loves make up. From childhood I was fascinated. None of the women in my family wear it. I saw it in friends of the family and art galleries as my parents are artists.\n\nI had very little draw (pun intended) to the fine arts or equivalent but I became a make up artist training at one of the best colleges in the world. It is *artistry* to my natural self.\n\nI have been told by my family and people from my culture not to wear make up for 40 years. I hid it as a teen and all making it forbidden did was make me emigrate to pursue it. I have gone on to do all kinds of jobs. Just in eyeliner.\n\nMy brother naturally loved drawing and went onto a career in that. Funnily enough no one had an issue. Also I\u2019m queer. I never wore make up for the male gaze and could never understand why anyone thought I would. I wore it for me because I appreciate the artistry and technique. Do we say boys who like souped up cars only do it for girls to like them?\n\nNAH. Quite a few products I\u2019d skip at this age. Inc mascara", "Can we stop doing this?\n\nMy wife loves herself. She's a wonderful, smart, confident woman-- a physician, assistant chief of medicine for a large medical team, mother of two.\n\nShe also likes wearing makeup. \n\nI love myself, I also spent $6000 to do Invisalign. I spend money on nice clothes and shoes. It's okay to like making yourself look the best you can.", "Yes! NYX and e.l.f are great options for both kids and adults. Low cost, lots of color options, and way safer than the \"play makeup\" sets.", "Yeah. Like, whether or not you agree with the husband is a personnal viewpoint, as we can see in comments. That's something OP and her husband need to adress together. Because makeup is indeed a mean to self-express but you can't ignore the social stigma and pressure there is around it, so it's worth debating.\n\nBut you can't say the situation wasn't handled with grace. Dad complimented his young daughter's makeup even if he said he preferred her without, and adressed the issue with OP in private, calmly and respectfully. NAH here, in my opinion.", "That can happen when she's older than 8", "That sounds good I was very interested in this post for different points of view. I have a 6 year old girly girl who loves make up and don\u2019t really know what to do. Our current line is it\u2019s like face paint, so just for fun then we take it off. Not for out and about normally. You say year 6, are you in the uk? I am and was also thinking secondary school/high school but everything is getting younger and younger, don\u2019t get me started on kids in her class with mobile phones already \ud83d\ude05.", "YEP. Consider that often women don\u2019t tell other women they look better or worse with or without some cosmetic-whatever. \n\nIt\u2019s generally men who use the \u201cyou look better without\u201d \u201cI like you better without\u201d statements. And it comes from a time where men\u2019s opinion of a woman\u2019s appearance mattered most. It\u2019s a backwards way of saying \u201cdon\u2019t be like those other girls\u201d.", "Yeah, I feel like the approach to makeup is what matters. My kid has gotten into lip glosses and smeared them all over her face and I say, cool, let\u2019s just wash that off before bed because you shouldn\u2019t wear makeup to bed. I try not to make a big deal because acting like it\u2019s forbidden would make it seem more exciting.", "The Dr Pepper one was my favorite.", "This is so not the point but HARD AGREE on the mascara. When I was in middle school the bright color mascaras were a thing and I ended up stabbing myself in the eye with a bright blue wand and for what?! \n\nMore to the point, I have a lot of good memories of playing with makeup from around 9-14 because that's when it really was about \"Let's put bright purple sparkle on my face because I CAN!\" Once it became about \"looking better\" it lost significant appeal. A healthy conversation about this could be great for bonding with their kid and showing her that they'll always support her expressing herself in healthy ways.... /rant.\n\nThank you for coming to this presentation of Unpacking Middle School.", "Right. Like I like my hair just fine but I also sometimes like hair accessories because they're fun and I can change my look up a bit. \n\nMakeup can be sexualized culturally of course (weirdly and unfortunately). And of course makeup hygiene is important. But pound for pound makeup itself is pretty neutral", "Definitely agree with this. My best friend wanted to be a cosmetologist and was really into makeup, and also grew up poor. She swore by those two brands.", "Wet & Wild is great too and has come a looooong way in terms of quality in the past 15-20 years. e.l.f. has gotten pricy in terms of their lipsticks and lip gloss.", "Oh right, I forgot. A mom putting a bit of blue eyeshadow on an 8-year-old for one dinner is exactly the same as parents habitually shellacking their elementary-schooler with pageant makeup. Totally comparable situations.", "To be honest in year 6 I used to wear makeup out so I will let her but just not to school. And yes face paint is an amazing idea she will love it as she loves art and things like such.

I was definitely allowed makeup in year 6 and when we go through old photos she is already pointing out that I had makeup and glitter in an school disco photo, hard to argue with that.
