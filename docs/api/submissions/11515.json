We live in a HCOL area, it's a win-win. I pay reduced rent and my sister gets money towards her mortgage and I get to see my neice and nephews everyday. I have a decent Pok\u00e9mon Card collection. What I have really isn't in cards but it's sealed product. \n\n\nOver the years I have bought items from the store and put them on my shelf unopened. They stop making certain items and the value goes up. I'd say my collection is worth over $15k and it's taken about 4yrs to build it up. My nephews are 7 and 8 and while they like Pok\u00e9mon they were never interested in the collection aspect and were always uninterested. \n\n\nRecently I have been buying individual packs of a certain set. They're hard to find and they're very popular. Over the span of 2 years I have gotten 135pks of these packs. I paid $3.99+tax a pack that are worth $8. I organized these packs in a couple boxes and had them in my basement near my shelf. The other day I found a couple more so I put them in and recounted and my counts were 10 off. I think, \"Okay, maybe I recounted. No biggie.\" A couple days later I see two stacks of cards in the kitchen, I look at them and they're cards from that specific set. I check the trash and no wrappers. So I go back down and recounted and I'm 10 more off. At this point I know I didn't miscount by 20. So I went and checked their room and look under their beds and BINGO. I found all the wrappers.\n\n I ask my nephews who had the idea of stealing from me and they both went quiet. I told them I'm not THAT MAD at them but I'm upset, those were valuable packs and there was a reason I had so many of them that I didn't open. If they would've just asked me I could've either went and bought something cheap to open or dug something up. \n\nPart of me thought it was funny, they're kids and it's freaking Pok\u00e9mon. So I tell my BIL and he shakes his head and I told him they're lucky they didnt get a pack with an expensive card and ruin it, he laughs and I laugh. I texted my sister and told her they  were shit heads. She said they need to repay me that she's  \"Not gonna raise little assholes who think they can steal.\" I  do agree so I told her they took 20pks that were $3.99+ tax each she was shocked they took 20 and I told her \"Yes 20 at $3.99, BUT they're worth $8 and I can't just walk into Wal-Mart and replace these. I can't get these for less than $8 each.\" She stands her ground. I was out house sitting for a friend but I know those kids got a mouthful from my sister.\n I don't think these kids owe me $160, I'm fine with them knowing it's not okay to steal and I think $40 from each kid is fair. So does my sister and BIL. \n\n\n\nI go out to dinner and tell my dad and step mom and great aunt and uncle (Essentially grandma and grandpa)what I wrote.  They think my sister and BIL are too harsh and that I'm being ridiculous for wanting them to repay. I told them I disagree but I still feel partly bad, my nephews are my buddies. My sister and BIL pay them for chores but I've never seen them actually spend money. They get toys and whatnot whenever my sister goes to Walmart so their allowance is basically to show work=money \n AITA?", "created_utc": 1677996304, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ipc8e/aita_for_making_my_nephews_repay_me_after/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The key part is that you didn\u2019t scream at them or anything, nor did you make your sister force them to pay you back. You know how much they are worth and they stole 20 packs for heaven\u2019s sake. I\u2019m impressed you aren\u2019t really that mad about it.\n\nAlso, she\u2019s right - they need to learn that stealing is bad. $40 is like, two small LEGO sets these days. It\u2019s not that big of a deal, nor are you even charging them full price. Plus, you were nice about it.", "The attitude of dad and aunt are why there are so many entitled children around. Good for your sister and bil to understand the value of consequences. And double good for you to understand a lesson vs pounding the $160 into their souls. NTA", "Nta. Even the parents agree. This will be a lesson well learned for the kids.", "NTA. You didn't blow up at them nor were you overly harsh. Your sister and BIL seem like good people.", "NTA and - miracle of miracles - there are two parents on this planet who actually know what they\u2019re doing!", "NTA. I actually don't think you're being harsh enough.\n\nIf the penalty for stealing is having to repay the value of what was stolen, then that is an ineffective penalty: the worst outcome is that you get caught and are no worse off. If the penalty is not even having to repay the full value, then that's even less of a disincentive to steal: you make a profit regardless of whether you are caught.\n\nTime for those kids to cough up more than the value of what they stole. Perhaps three times the value. And if they can't afford it then I guess it's coming out of any birthday money they get until it's all paid back. Perhaps they'll really learn not to steal.", "NTA, they need to learn not to stel, plus you don't ask for the full price.", "NTA. Neither you or their parents are asking for something extreme for a 7 or 8 year old, or went off at them. You would be the AH if you didn\u2019t teach them stealing is bad", "They need to repay you. They stole from you. YTA if you don\u2019t collect the money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
