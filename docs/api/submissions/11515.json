{"id": 11515, "submission_id": "11ipc8e", "title": "AITA For Making My Nephews Repay Me After Stealing Pok\u00e9mon Cards", "selftext": "I 30m rent my sister's basement. We live in a HCOL area, it's a win-win. I pay reduced rent and my sister gets money towards her mortgage and I get to see my neice and nephews everyday. I have a decent Pok\u00e9mon Card collection. What I have really isn't in cards but it's sealed product. \n\n\nOver the years I have bought items from the store and put them on my shelf unopened. They stop making certain items and the value goes up. I'd say my collection is worth over $15k and it's taken about 4yrs to build it up. My nephews are 7 and 8 and while they like Pok\u00e9mon they were never interested in the collection aspect and were always uninterested. \n\n\nRecently I have been buying individual packs of a certain set. They're hard to find and they're very popular. Over the span of 2 years I have gotten 135pks of these packs. I paid $3.99+tax a pack that are worth $8. I organized these packs in a couple boxes and had them in my basement near my shelf. The other day I found a couple more so I put them in and recounted and my counts were 10 off. I think, \"Okay, maybe I miscounted. No biggie.\" A couple days later I see two stacks of cards in the kitchen, I look at them and they're cards from that specific set. I check the trash and no wrappers. So I go back down and recounted and I'm 10 more off. At this point I know I didn't miscount by 20. So I went and checked their room and look under their beds and BINGO. I found all the wrappers.\n\n I ask my nephews who had the idea of stealing from me and they both went quiet. I told them I'm not THAT MAD at them but I'm upset, those were valuable packs and there was a reason I had so many of them that I didn't open. If they would've just asked me I could've either went and bought something cheap to open or dug something up. \n\nPart of me thought it was funny, they're kids and it's freaking Pok\u00e9mon. So I tell my BIL and he shakes his head and I told him they're lucky they didnt get a pack with an expensive card and ruin it, he laughs and I laugh. I texted my sister and told her they  were shit heads. She said they need to repay me that she's  \"Not gonna raise little assholes who think they can steal.\" I  do agree so I told her they took 20pks that were $3.99+ tax each she was shocked they took 20 and I told her \"Yes 20 at $3.99, BUT they're worth $8 and I can't just walk into Wal-Mart and replace these. I can't get these for less than $8 each.\" She stands her ground. I was out house sitting for a friend but I know those kids got a mouthful from my sister.\n I don't think these kids owe me $160, I'm fine with them knowing it's not okay to steal and I think $40 from each kid is fair. So does my sister and BIL. \n\n\n\nI go out to dinner and tell my dad and step mom and great aunt and uncle (Essentially  they're the nephews grandma and grandpa) what I wrote.  They think my sister and BIL are too harsh and that I'm being ridiculous for wanting them to repay. I told them I disagree but I still feel partly bad, my nephews are my buddies. My sister and BIL pay them for chores but I've never seen them actually spend money. They get toys and whatnot whenever my sister goes to Walmart so their allowance is basically to show work=money \n AITA?\n\n\n\nThanks for confirming we're not being Aholes about this. I wasn't home when my sister confronted my nephews but I'm certain they got a mouthful and they feel bad. My great aunt and uncle ( my moms aunt,  are basically great grandma and grandpa to the kids, the actual grandma and grandpa aren't in our lives. Its Complicated) are notorious for letting the kids do whatever they want and when they come from a weekend over they act like the biggest brats. They always think punishment is wrong, and they go as far to think my nephews are punished nonstop and are afraid of my sister and BIL. They most definitely are not. Like many of you said it's the grandparents acting like grandparents.\n\n\nTo the Pok\u00e9mon collectors asking. Yes they were Evolving Skies packs. I  went through everything they opened and the most expensive card was less than $4. \n\n\nTo the non Pok\u00e9mon collector's. It's the most popular  set in this era of Pok\u00e9mon. The most expensive card in the set is worth over $500, the second is $250 with several others in the $50-$170 range.\n\nTo the people ask \"Why I'm going around and telling other family members\" it's a story that I can laugh at and we were at dinner.  I didnt think it's THAT BIG of a deal.", "created_utc": 1677996304, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ipc8e/aita_for_making_my_nephews_repay_me_after/", "score": 376, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m impressed you aren\u2019t really that mad about it.\n\nAlso, she\u2019s right - they need to learn that stealing is bad. $40 is like, two small LEGO sets these days.

Your sister and BIL seem like good people.", "NTA and - miracle of miracles - there are two parents on this planet who actually know what they\u2019re doing!", "NTA. I actually don't think you're being harsh enough.\n\nIf the penalty for stealing is having to repay the value of what was stolen, then that is an ineffective penalty: the worst outcome is that you get caught and are no worse off. If the penalty is not even having to repay the full value, then that's even less of a disincentive to steal: you make a profit regardless of whether you are caught.\n\nTime for those kids to cough up more than the value of what they stole. Perhaps three times the value. And if they can't afford it then I guess it's coming out of any birthday money they get until it's all paid back. Perhaps they'll really learn not to steal.", "NTA, they need to learn not to stel, plus you don't ask for the full price.", "NTA.

I'd do the same if my kids did that.", "This is a pretty unhinged take.\n\nThe kids weren't able to keep the cards, at least not the expensive ones that make the packs worth it. They were just excited to open the packs themselves.\n\nA 7 and 8 year old repaying $160 is harsh. Those same kids repaying $480 is ludicrous.", "NTA There are consequences for stealing. You and the parents agreed on a fair punishment. Kids are so silly. All they had to do was ask! Why did they steal?", "NTA for me. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being harsh at all, you took that better than I would have. \n\nYou\u2019re fine with it, BIL and whomever is fine with it; nobody else\u2019s business imo.

You (and your BIL/sister) have this one right.", "NTA,  7 and 8 year olds know stealing is wrong, they even tried to hide it from you.

Maybe they are harsh in other people's point of view, but she is doing the right thing.", "People like OP's other relatives don't seem to understand that if you care about kids, you give them proportionate consequences when they do something wrong. Kids NEED the nurturing adults in their lives to teach them right from wrong.\n\nNTA", "Most most kids, having to pay back the money should be enough of a lesson. They're stealing because they want the thing *and* the money, so making them forfeit the money isn't really making them \"no worse off\" from their perspective.", "Ew. I'm pretty sure this will be lesson learned. If they do it again you do hard. It's ok to not go into full beastmode on kids when trying to teach them a lesson.", "The strictest set of parents I know (and I mean *strict*) are now the most doting and lenient grandparents I know. They're good people, but it's a bit of an odd transformation to watch.", "NTA. I hope that they understood the punishment and the gravity of the loss. They clearly don\u2019t understand card collecting yet. So I think it is important that they understand the actual value lost and that they are only being asked to pay a fraction of it. That way you and their parents come out as the understanding adults who are reasonable and lenient but will not put up with bad behavior. Personally, I would probably then use that money (some of it at least) and take them to buy their own cards. This gives you and your nephews all another thing to bond over.", "NTA. You sorted it out with your sister and BIL but why go and tell other family members.", "NTA. And I assume these are *Evolving Skies* packs, right?", "NTA That is exactly the way to handle it.", "NTA.  Consequences.  Sounds like your sister and BIL are going to raise responsible kids.", "NTA. They need to understand actions have consequences. They will hopefully think twice before stealing again after having to pay you back.", "NTA.  They are old enough to know better than to steal other peoples' property.  They need to learn actions have consequences.  They should not be allowed to get away without some kind punishment.  \n\nHave a very serious talk with them about what they did, how it effects you.  Don't make light of it.

Their Mom is doing a great job parenting by demanding that they repay you for what they STOLE! Hopefully, they learn their lesson and don't repeat the same mistake.

You're not being unreasonable in the amount you're asking for.", "NTA. I totally get it. Pokemon has exploded lately. \n\nAlso. If you have a Publix that's nearby.

Everything else I own is either boxes or etbs etc they are the only loose items in my collection and I had 135 of them in a cardboard box so I understand the temptation of seeing so many loose packs. Especially as a kid", "Sadly I don't have a Publix, I'm in Colorado so I have King Soopers which is Kroger and I have been able to get some Evolving Skies from there the last few weeks. I have two right by my work. This last week one of them has been completely dry and the other I was able to them for the first time. Hopefully this week they restock. But it's also typical for one person to buy out the inventory.", "Haha! They were in fact Evolving Skies hanger packs.

This is a good lesson for your nephews!", "It\u2019s uncle but yeah. I agree", "That's fair. I wish you luck in your hunt!", "The Leafeon was the only Eeveelution Vmax I could pull myself. I did pull the Rayquaza back when the set first dropped and he was more expensive than Umbreon at the time. I think where I screwed up is last week I was showing the younger nephew my Umbreon and told him it was worth $500 and then I showed him Leafeon and he got all giggly and said Leafeon was cute, he was also pretty shocked a card could be worth that much. It was a couple days later the packs went missing. I opened packs with my older nephew and he became pretty uninterested very quick when we weren't getting good pulls."]}
