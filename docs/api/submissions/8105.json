We've been doing this for a decade now. These weekend trips consist of us staying in a suite and exploring the city, not traversing the wilderness so it's not like we're completely disconnected. Still, we liked to keep one on hand for navigation and emergency purposes, and it would usually be Friend's phone that we brought along.  \n\nFriend and I left for our trip this year two Fridays ago to make use of the long weekend. This was the first time I've gone one on of these trips since my wife and I moved in together, got engaged, or got married. However, we were dating for the last two years worth of trips (2021 and 2022), and she seemed fine during that time. I would just tell her I was going to be busy for the weekend and she'd leave me alone. \n\nI understand that there are different expectations once you get married, but I didn't expect for the 180 in behavior. My wife all but demanded I take my phone as well in case she needed to get ahold of me despite her having Friend's number. I let her know I had arrived and immediately after that she was texting me and asking me how things were. Then again, asking me another question when I didn't respond to the first one. I eventually muted our text conversation because I was sick of the phone buzzing. \n\nShe called me a few hours later and asked why I wasn't responding to her texts. I reiterated that this was supposed to be a no phone weekend and kept the call short despite her trying to drag out the conversation. She called me once more after this. When I answered and found out it wasn't an emergency, I simply turned off my phone. The calls then started coming in for my friend and he followed suit. We spent the rest of the weekend with our phones off until the drive back on Monday.\n\nI called my wife and informed her when we were about 30 minutes away from my place and she was furious. She said that there ended up being an emergency (her sister got into a car accident that won't affect her long-term, but still resulted in broken bones) and that I had just ignored her the entire time when she 'needed me.' I told her that I was very sorry to hear about her sister, but it wasn't my fault she had essentially forced my hand into cutting off means of communication. She went to stay with a friend before I arrived home that night and has since came home, but she's still fuming.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674520744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jsjty/aita_for_missing_an_actual_emergency_because_i/", "score": 6854, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What if your family got into an accident and died before you could return? What if you had kids and they got into an accident or was attacked?\n\nIn this, however, I can't really blame you. Ideally you should have told her to send any emergency messages through X friend or Y family member and then blocked her temporarily so that you still had a line of communication in any emergency.\n\nBut I get simply turning off the phone because she was being a massive ass about it since you've told her before to not contact for emergencies while on the trip and even on the trip when she repeatedly broke that rule you still warned her again before blocking her when she broke it the 3rd? 4th? time.\n\nIn the end, you need to talk to her and implement a sort of plan to stop this from repeating. Since she has shown she can't follow basic requests I would set something up where she can not directly contact you on these trips.

We've been doing this for a decade now. These weekend trips consist of us staying in a suite and exploring the city, not traversing the wilderness so it's not like we're completely disconnected. Still, we liked to keep one on hand for navigation and emergency purposes, and it would usually be Friend's phone that we brought along.  \n\nFriend and I left for our trip this year two Fridays ago to make use of the long weekend. This was the first time I've gone one on of these trips since my wife and I moved in together, got engaged, or got married. However, we were dating for the last two years worth of trips (2021 and 2022), and she seemed fine during that time. I would just tell her I was going to be busy for the weekend and she'd leave me alone. \n\nI understand that there are different expectations once you get married, but I didn't expect for the 180 in behavior. My wife all but demanded I take my phone as well in case she needed to get ahold of me despite her having Friend's number. I let her know I had arrived and immediately after that she was texting me and asking me how things were. Then again, asking me another question when I didn't respond to the first one. I eventually muted our text conversation because I was sick of the phone buzzing. \n\nShe called me a few hours later and asked why I wasn't responding to her texts. I reiterated that this was supposed to be a no phone weekend and kept the call short despite her trying to drag out the conversation. She called me once more after this. When I answered and found out it wasn't an emergency, I simply turned off my phone. The calls then started coming in for my friend and he followed suit. We spent the rest of the weekend with our phones off until the drive back on Monday.\n\nI called my wife and informed her when we were about 30 minutes away from my place and she was furious. She said that there ended up being an emergency (her sister got into a car accident that won't affect her long-term, but still resulted in broken bones) and that I had just ignored her the entire time when she 'needed me.' I told her that I was very sorry to hear about her sister, but it wasn't my fault she had essentially forced my hand into cutting off means of communication. She went to stay with a friend before I arrived home that night and has since came home, but she's still fuming.  \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I mean technically NTA\u2026but do you like your wife\u2026at all?", "You Are NTA.    I don't know when society decided we needed to be on-call 24/7.  And even this \"emergency\" was not something you were needed for.  She sounds whiny, needy, and very immature.  If she was disabled and had known medical conditions, maybe you would BTA, but clearly not here.\n\nFrankly, more people need to go communication-free more often and actually enjoy life, rather than take pictures of it to share so other people will THINK you're enjoying life.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nI don't get the ppl saying YTA. I'd be so fed up with that bullshit, I would've turned the phone off, too. Things don't HAVE to change in a marriage. I went on my bachelor's party with my to-be wife at home with the kids. While mid-flight, my daughter's ear ruptured. They had to go to the ER, it was rough. But, my wife didn't bother me with it. I was headed to the woods and couldn't get reception. But, I checked in when I could. If course, my wife handled it like an adult, didn't freak out, and I got to enjoy my time, too.\n\nI would wonder why your wife felt as if she had to be in communication with you the whole time, even before the accident, despite your repeated attempts to shut it down. And, when she pivots the conversation to \"but there WAS an accident....\" redirect her back to before the accident. Again, why did she want you at the ready?

Turning off your phone is not a good idea or answer, what if she was in trouble or got into an accident?

She knows how these trips go. You repeated to her that this was supposed to be a tech free weekend.

It just can\u2019t. Because vacation time is limited and making the topic off limits to even truly discuss is a massive problem. Going on the trip isn\u2019t inherently the problem. Not hearing your wife\u2019s concerns about the codependency in this friendship and then making a trip with this friend nonnegotiable reflects your boundaries and priorities being off.\n\nUnlike a lot of other commenters, I don\u2019t think your wife was being hypocritical by the constant contacting\u2014I think that she was poorly trying to establish that she, as your wife, was still your main person when you were alone with someone who she sees as a threat to your marriage.

I understand being frustrated that your wife is interrupting your tech free weekend, and I can see how it can be annoying when she deliberately wants to drag out conversation just for fun but if she's calling your friend to try to get ahold of you, wouldn't you be worried-- if not at least a little curious what she wants or could possibly need? Being in a partnership to offer emotional support is not always convenient for both parties.
