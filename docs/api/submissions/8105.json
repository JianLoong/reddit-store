We've been doing this for a decade now. These weekend trips consist of us staying in a suite and exploring the city, not traversing the wilderness so it's not like we're completely disconnected. Still, we liked to keep one on hand for navigation and emergency purposes, and it would usually be Friend's phone that we brought along.  \n\nFriend and I left for our trip this year two Fridays ago to make use of the long weekend. This was the first time I've gone one on of these trips since my wife and I moved in together, got engaged, or got married. However, we were dating for the last two years worth of trips (2021 and 2022), and she seemed fine during that time. I would just tell her I was going to be busy for the weekend and she'd leave me alone. \n\nI understand that there are different expectations once you get married, but I didn't expect for the 180 in behavior. My wife all but demanded I take my phone as well in case she needed to get ahold of me despite her having Friend's number. I let her know I had arrived and immediately after that she was texting me and asking me how things were. Then again, asking me another question when I didn't respond to the first one. I eventually muted our text conversation because I was sick of the phone buzzing. \n\nShe called me a few hours later and asked why I wasn't responding to her texts. I reiterated that this was supposed to be a no phone weekend and kept the call short despite her trying to drag out the conversation. She called me once more after this. When I answered and found out it wasn't an emergency, I simply turned off my phone. The calls then started coming in for my friend and he followed suit. We spent the rest of the weekend with our phones off until the drive back on Monday.\n\nI called my wife and informed her when we were about 30 minutes away from my place and she was furious. She said that there ended up being an emergency (her sister got into a car accident that won't affect her long-term, but still resulted in broken bones) and that I had just ignored her the entire time when she 'needed me.' I told her that I was very sorry to hear about her sister, but it wasn't my fault she had essentially forced my hand into cutting off means of communication. She went to stay with a friend before I arrived home that night and has since came home, but she's still fuming.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674520744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jsjty/aita_for_missing_an_actual_emergency_because_i/", "score": 800, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course it is. But the downside is that some people abuse it, just like OP's wife did. \n\nOP, you were available for emergencies until your wife demonstrated that she was going to abuse that.

Ideally you should have told her to send any emergency messages through X friend or Y family member and then blocked her temporarily so that you still had a line of communication in any emergency.\n\nBut I get simply turning off the phone because she was being a massive ass about it since you've told her before to not contact for emergencies while on the trip and even on the trip when she repeatedly broke that rule you still warned her again before blocking her when she broke it the 3rd? 4th? time.\n\nIn the end, you need to talk to her and implement a sort of plan to stop this from repeating. Since she has shown she can't follow basic requests I would set something up where she can not directly contact you on these trips.

We've been doing this for a decade now. These weekend trips consist of us staying in a suite and exploring the city, not traversing the wilderness so it's not like we're completely disconnected. Still, we liked to keep one on hand for navigation and emergency purposes, and it would usually be Friend's phone that we brought along.  \n\nFriend and I left for our trip this year two Fridays ago to make use of the long weekend. This was the first time I've gone one on of these trips since my wife and I moved in together, got engaged, or got married. However, we were dating for the last two years worth of trips (2021 and 2022), and she seemed fine during that time. I would just tell her I was going to be busy for the weekend and she'd leave me alone. \n\nI understand that there are different expectations once you get married, but I didn't expect for the 180 in behavior. My wife all but demanded I take my phone as well in case she needed to get ahold of me despite her having Friend's number. I let her know I had arrived and immediately after that she was texting me and asking me how things were. Then again, asking me another question when I didn't respond to the first one. I eventually muted our text conversation because I was sick of the phone buzzing. \n\nShe called me a few hours later and asked why I wasn't responding to her texts. I reiterated that this was supposed to be a no phone weekend and kept the call short despite her trying to drag out the conversation. She called me once more after this. When I answered and found out it wasn't an emergency, I simply turned off my phone. The calls then started coming in for my friend and he followed suit. We spent the rest of the weekend with our phones off until the drive back on Monday.\n\nI called my wife and informed her when we were about 30 minutes away from my place and she was furious. She said that there ended up being an emergency (her sister got into a car accident that won't affect her long-term, but still resulted in broken bones) and that I had just ignored her the entire time when she 'needed me.' I told her that I was very sorry to hear about her sister, but it wasn't my fault she had essentially forced my hand into cutting off means of communication. She went to stay with a friend before I arrived home that night and has since came home, but she's still fuming.  \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't know when society decided we needed to be on-call 24/7.  And even this \"emergency\" was not something you were needed for.  She sounds whiny, needy, and very immature.  If she was disabled and had known medical conditions, maybe you would BTA, but clearly not here.\n\nFrankly, more people need to go communication-free more often and actually enjoy life, rather than take pictures of it to share so other people will THINK you're enjoying life.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nI don't get the ppl saying YTA. I'd be so fed up with that bullshit, I would've turned the phone off, too. Things don't HAVE to change in a marriage. I went on my bachelor's party with my to-be wife at home with the kids. While mid-flight, my daughter's ear ruptured. They had to go to the ER, it was rough. But, my wife didn't bother me with it. I was headed to the woods and couldn't get reception. But, I checked in when I could. If course, my wife handled it like an adult, didn't freak out, and I got to enjoy my time, too.\n\nI would wonder why your wife felt as if she had to be in communication with you the whole time, even before the accident, despite your repeated attempts to shut it down.

It just can\u2019t. Because vacation time is limited and making the topic off limits to even truly discuss is a massive problem. Going on the trip isn\u2019t inherently the problem.

Her sibling breaking bones is not a real emergency that requires emotional support for a normal person, although she is clearly not a normal person given the clinginess on display during the trip.", "thats not an emergency.  a grown adult breaking a few bones is in no way shape or form an emergency.   its an unfortunate accident, but not an emergency.   The wife is just looking for reasons to complain.", "Except she was bombarding the friend\u2019s phone too.", "She set herself up though.

If needed we could have easily gone no contact. \n\nI would also say NTA for your post. I see why your wife might be upset,  she sounds like a needy drama queen to me. I would struggle very much to be married to someone like that and I completely understand the need to be phone free once a year. \n\nMaybe next time you could come up with a list of situations together that constitute true emergencies ahead of time so that it\u2019s clear what would need your attention and what wouldn\u2019t.

There\u2019s literally no excuse to be unreachable when you have children in the picture just because you want alone time with your friend. Your children will *always* have to come first, and turning your phone off for two days to go a \u201cnonnegotiable\u201d trip is not putting your children first. \n\n(This is all hypothetical of course, just hoping to get my point across that you don\u2019t need to disappear for two days without your phone to have \u201calone time\u201d with a friend.)", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be kids, or even possibly a marriage.

Presumably that would have remained the same IF your wife hadn\u2019t been blowing up his phone after you turned yours off because she couldn\u2019t respect a simple low contact request during your trip. IF you have kids in the future, you would still be reachable by that number. This here is a fuck around and find out situation. Your wife disregarded your request and so you became unreachable. Sure, maybe that wouldn\u2019t be an option when kids are around, and yeah I\u2019m not recommending you disappear for a weekend if/when you have a newborn or whatever, but ffs you\u2019re allowed to go on your annual trip and ask not to be harassed.\n\nAnd for anyone who even thinks of saying \u201chow would you feel?\u201d to me\u2026 I visit friends/family in my hometown often and when I\u2019m catching up with someone or busy with specific plans my husband happily leaves me to it and when he\u2019s gone to visit friends or on a road trip with his dad I also respect his time and don\u2019t blow up his phone unnecessarily. \n\nNTA", "Why not just go on Do not Disturb", "There is the whole reason that she actually enjoys talking to you and communicating with you.

Why on earth didn't the wife just call the hotel and have them relay a message?", "Stop throwing words like stalker and abuse around to match ur agenda lmfao", "Stalker?  Lol. \n\nAll it takes is a wife to ask how her husband is doing to become a stalker?\n\nLol. OK buds.", "Why can't a person on the internet just care?

I have friends who come camping for the long weekends with me - 2 hours into the mountains with no service of any kind, phone or otherwise, and their kids survived the weekend with the other parent/grand parents/ friends parents just fine. That's a silly statement.", "Did you read the post? He has his phone, he only turned it off because she was constantly blowing it up.", "I wish I could upvote this more than once", "....at first I was going to say that this is very silly, but realistically I agree with you a bit", "that's pretty much equivalent to turning the phone off, unless he checks his phone frequently, which would be outside the parameters of the trip. so that's not really a better solution", "She clearly wouldn't like that either.  She got mad that she was \"ignored\" as is", "She might like being in constant communication but it\u2019s not just about her wants. One weekend is not a big request. She can curtail her wishes for one weekend.", "I think the weird thing is that this wasn't the first year he did this, just the first year they did it while married.

I know this was the weekend, but e.g. jury duty, getting dental work done, attending a funeral, being on a plane.  Anyone who believes that everyone with children must be available at all times needs to think about this some more.\n\nI ised to have people try to guilt trip me for silencing my phone when I go to bed.  \"Good thing I wasnt in a ditch.\"  \"If you were, why would you call me and not 911?  Thats literally what its for.\" \n\nYears of experience of people texting/calling at bizarre hours for insignificant reasons taught me that I cannot count on people to respect my boundaries if I never set any.\n\nSome people *gasp* dont even use cell phones.  Some people drop them, or lose them, or have them stolen, or break them.\n\nPhones going from a luxury item to a duty is an interesting transition.  By that comment's logic, it seems we need to carry at least two phones in case one breaks.\n\nWhether or not this was a voluntary trip is irrelevant if the standard is that we must always be available.  Likewise, using that logic a person would be TA if their phone was stolen or they were asleeo and didnt wake up.\n\nHow did people survive before they were available by phone at all times?  /s", "My last two girls trips were in another Country.

He said the trip was \u201cnonnegotiable\u201d, I wanted to know how \u201cnonnegotiable\u201d the trip is for him. He married this woman to start a life with her. And it says in the post wife had to demand he take his phone with him this time because he wasn\u2019t planning on bringing it. If an emergency where to happen if/when they have kids and he was unreachable that\u2019d be way worst than what actually happened, and I acknowledge that by saying it was all hypothetical. \n\nAlso you can totally do male bonding without leaving for two days. Do I think OP was wrong *this time*? No, not really. But at some point down down the line (*if* they have children, like I asked if they where planning to) something will have to change.\n\nAlso I did the \u201c\u201d around male bonding because you absolutely do not need to go on a two day trip in order to bond with other males lol", "The wife clearly isn\u2019t fine with him being unreachable anymore and they haven\u2019t been married long from what I can gather. If she\u2019s not okay with him being unreachable without kids in the picture do you really think she would change her tune once (if) they have kids?

In the event of children, he simply needs to leave his phone on. Even parents are allowed to do their own thing once in a while.", "She was fine with it prior to being married, nothing changed except their marriage status. Basing the AH status on imaginary children is a bit of a stretch", "i mean, since it sounds like this is the 3rd time he has done the trip since they have been together, so my guess is he has made it clear that he only uses the phone for emergencies, not just for random chit chat when she feels like it.   I'm guessing what he wrote in the post wasn't verbatim, nor was it the only conversation ever had about this trip"]}
