Tell your SIL that your niece can love and admire your books while at your house only, and she can love her own copy as much as she wants when she gets one for Christmas.", "NTA tell your SiL that your niece can borrow them but if they\u2019re damaged, which is based entirely on your judgement, that she will be paying to replace them.

You are entitled to do whatever you want with the books given that you bought them your hard earned money.

And honestly I think my neice would try and be careful, but she's young and things happen. I've seen the state of her books.

Its also kind of childish of her to say those things to your niece, that might think your niece think that those things are true.", "Lend your niece the paperback copy :)", "Or find a way to guilt OP into seeing the book so she can steal it and sell it, and use the whole \"it's just a kid's book\" as an excuse", "Haha she has all the paperbacks, she just likes illustrations. Kid has good taste. Husband says she's a champagne drinker on a beer budget lol. We decided we're going to get her the first two for Christmas and I know she'll freak, I'm really excited.

Most are in mint condition/in the box.

Calling you out in a group chat was a nasty move, please send a rebuttal to the chat, if she protests (and she will) tell her that she  brought this public.

But she's welcome to view them, under supervision, when she's here - something for her to look forward to.\"\n\nThen watch the books like a hawk when they visit. Don't be naive - in similar circumstances AITA has had stories of people grabbing them nonetheless - the entitlement of some people is beyond belief.\n\nIt's also not out of the question that SIL will try to damage them accidentally-on-purpose. You're not giving her what she wants and retaliation is not out of the question. People like that don't like to be denied.\n\nTotally NTA.", "Add that if she is prepared to provide the value of the book as a deposit for borrowing it, then she may do so, but be prepared not to received the funds back in the event that a 10 year old causes damage to a book as is most likely to happen.", "I'd be hesitant to let her know the value of anything i care about.
