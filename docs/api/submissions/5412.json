It's been great, but I let him know from the outset that I was a recovering alcoholic. He had no problem with that, and he still drinks with his friends, but won't do that in my presence. It still bothers me that he drinks, but it's his life, I can't tell him what to do.\n\nFast forward to last Sunday, and we're at his apartment. I come in, and he's in the middle of making pasta sauce, and there's a large bottle of vodka on the counter. I didn't say anything about the bottle, but he saw me staring at it, and he told me it's for the sauce.\n\nPasta sauce he's made me at least twice a month for the entirety of our relationship.\n\nHe said he's told me from the beginning he does that, that it cooks away, but I think that would be something I would very much remember, and I got a little angry. I knocked the bottle off the counter and went to my mom's.\n\nHe's called and apologized for triggering me, and that he was being brainless, but he wants me to pay for the broken bottle, which he says was about an $80 brand. I told him that I wasn't under any circumstances going to pay for something he's been lacing my food with for years.\n\nWe haven't really talked since, and my mom wants me to just go ahead and buy the thing to make amends, and I'm still refusing. AITA?\n\nEdit: I didn't smash the bottle, I pushed it off the counter and it broke. I didn't throw it.  \nEdit2: alright, I get it. I'm going to get him $80 worth of stuff to make up for it. But I really don't appreciate being called violent or abusive. I've never hit him once, and I think that's a pretty rash assumption.  \n", "created_utc": 1671757598, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt2hsu/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_boyfriends_vodka/", "score": 1213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've obviously not been set back in your recovery by consuming a trace amount of alcohol in cooked food. If he really thought this was OK, he wasn't being malicious. You can set this as a boundary going ahead if you make it through this conflict, but you were out of line to break the bottle. \n\nAs a general rule, when loved ones upset us, breaking things, punching walls, or otherwise physically venting temper in destructive ways is not a good thing.", "YTA. \n\nplease oh my god, just talk like an adult instead of breaking a bottle of alcohol in a tantrum. you are 26 years old. act like it. just repay him and never speak to him again. \n\nyall aint compatible, and go to therapy. this shouldnt be a normal reaction to your anger.", "So you\u2019re telling me he\u2019s made this for you so many times but you\u2019ve never once seen a vodka bottle out before? He\u2019s not lacing your food with anything, and it does cook away if done properly - which I\u2019m sure he is  doing since he does it so often. \n\nBuy a replacement bottle since you broke it, no matter how much you wanna minimize it. Hitting something which causes it to break means you broke it. YTA", "YTA.  There is no alcohol remaining in the food so he was not \"lacing your food\".  Of course you can ask him not to make that dish in the future if it triggers you.  Still, you destroyed someone else's property and you need to make restitution.", "Penne a la vodka?  One of my favorites.  It\u2019s a very common dish in my area, and he possibly didn\u2019t even think that it would be an issue.  I know I wouldn\u2019t.

That takes a lot of strength and courage.\n\nBut in this case, YTA although I understand your emotional response. Many people put vodka in pasta sauce -- it's called Tomato Vodka sauce. The alcohol does boil away. Whenever you cook with alcohol, unless you add it at the very end, it boils away.\n\nEDIT: several people have pointed out it doesn't all boil away. That's true. But we're literally talking about a tablespoon of vodka in the entire sauce, and much of it boils away. My point is NOT that you're wrong for wanting no alcohol at all in anything you eat. That's your right., It's that you're wrong for how you dealt with it.\n\nYou were wrong to break the bottle of vodka, whether it was a $20 or an $80 bottle. The cost isn't the point. The point is that it's his property, his intentions were good, and you destroyed it in a violent way. Destruction of property is actually on the road to an abusive relationship, so yeah, you need to apologize, and to pay for it.\n\nI get that being a recovering alcoholic is hard & you panicked when you saw that bottle, but you could've asked him not to put even boiled-out vodka in the sauce in the future. It sounds like he would've listened. If you requested him not to and he still did, then he'd be TA.

You break it, you bought it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about the struggles you are going through and it can\u2019t be easy but you broke it you bought it. \n\nPeople in relationships often forget even important things or think about telling their partner something and then think they told them when they didn\u2019t. Usually about small things but can happen about big things too. So I don\u2019t know who is right. But what you could have done is say *\u201coh my goodness I don\u2019t remember that conversation.

How would he know?\n\nAlso, I doubt this post is real.

Rum cake for example cant get you drunk unless you pour rum AFTER baking it. Yes - you definitely need to pay for that. I can understand you being alcohol-recovering \n, but that does not give you the right to break a bottle for a reason like that. Thats like you going up to a stranger at a restaurant and breaking their margerita glass cuz you didnt want it in your presence. Also, that would be the same as you destroying a rum cake, which is a very good cake because of the rum flavor that doesnt come from the alcohol itself\n\nEDIT - also your bf was following the recipe, you literally could have told him that you werent going to eat that to be safe, and kept it at that.", "We can\u2019t really judge this well without knowing what actually happened.

You can have a disagreement without destroying your SO's property. You need to apologize and pay for the bottle at the very least. I was married to an alcoholic and have zero alcohol in my house as it bothers my kids to see it. My ex was even worse with anger and violence when he would be sober for however long it would last (6 months was the most he ever went). It's called being a dry drunk. Not saying this is you. But if you do find that you reacted in anger and destructive behavior often, you should really get therapy as it can be extremely damaging to relationships. I personally find your behavior in this story to be very controlling and very unsettling as someone who has been on the other side of this.", "YTA!!! The fact that u acted like a kid. Idk if your boyfriend wants you back.. you sound like drama.", "Who really cares how the bottle broke? He is correct for being able to cook off the booze out of the sauce.

It\u2019s not lacing anything and if you think that it is, you need to get on Google and figure out what cooking is. You owe him the money for the item that you broke (which knocking over was in my opinion an abusive move).

It is ON YOU to control your outbursts and your addiction.", "YTA. \n\nAlcohol is an ingredient that cooks away and is only in the final product in very limited quantities.

I think you should accept that the sauce did you no harm, even if you don\u2019t want it served to you in the future. You should apologize for your reaction and for destroying something of value because you were angry. You should express your desire for him to apologize to you as well. \n\nBut I do think you overreacted and misbehaved. He should have communicated better but he genuinely wasn\u2019t serving you alcohol in any quantity that\u2019s worth being this upset over.

It's been great, but I let him know from the outset that I was a recovering alcoholic. He had no problem with that, and he still drinks with his friends, but won't do that in my presence. It still bothers me that he drinks, but it's his life, I can't tell him what to do.\n\nFast forward to last Sunday, and we're at his apartment. I come in, and he's in the middle of making pasta sauce, and there's a large bottle of vodka on the counter. I didn't say anything about the bottle, but he saw me staring at it, and he told me it's for the sauce.\n\nPasta sauce he's made me at least twice a month for the entirety of our relationship.\n\nHe said he's told me from the beginning he does that, that it cooks away, but I think that would be something I would very much remember, and I got a little angry. I knocked the bottle off the counter and went to my mom's.\n\nHe's called and apologized for triggering me, and that he was being brainless, but he wants me to pay for the broken bottle, which he says was about an $80 brand. I told him that I wasn't under any circumstances going to pay for something he's been lacing my food with for years. \n\nWe haven't really talked since, and my mom wants me to just go ahead and buy the thing to make amends, and I'm still refusing.

My stepdad is currently in hospital because he has brain damage caused by alcohol abuse. Before he went in, he could barely walk, and he's wasting away because his stomach lining is wrecked from all the vodka and he can't eat solid food. He knows that he's an alcoholic and he knows he's killing himself but he can't stop.

Alcoholism is terrifying and I can imagine that your boyfriend risking your sobriety for the sake of some tasty pasta sauce (like there aren't hundreds of alternatives) would feel like a huge violation.

I don't think that knocking the vodka off the counter was mature or constructive, but you were severely triggered, so all the commenters scolding you for not acting rationally can get in the bin tbqh.

It is the recovery that works for you, and I don't see how disrespecting and messing with that would be appropriate under any circumstance.\n\nHowever you could've told him just that. Breaking things because you are angry is not the way to go about anything. Talk about him. If it was too much of a breach of trust for you to get over, break up with him.

This is something she can control. She trusted her partner. He knew the boundaries and he broke them. If you're dating somebody who's in recovery you need to realize how serious that can be for some.
