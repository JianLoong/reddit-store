It's been great, but I let him know from the outset that I was a recovering alcoholic. He had no problem with that, and he still drinks with his friends, but won't do that in my presence. It still bothers me that he drinks, but it's his life, I can't tell him what to do.\n\nFast forward to last Sunday, and we're at his apartment. I come in, and he's in the middle of making pasta sauce, and there's a large bottle of vodka on the counter. I didn't say anything about the bottle, but he saw me staring at it, and he told me it's for the sauce.\n\nPasta sauce he's made me at least twice a month for the entirety of our relationship.\n\nHe said he's told me from the beginning he does that, that it cooks away, but I think that would be something I would very much remember, and I got a little angry. I knocked the bottle off the counter and went to my mom's.\n\nHe's called and apologized for triggering me, and that he was being brainless, but he wants me to pay for the broken bottle, which he says was about an $80 brand. I told him that I wasn't under any circumstances going to pay for something he's been lacing my food with for years.\n\nWe haven't really talked since, and my mom wants me to just go ahead and buy the thing to make amends, and I'm still refusing. AITA?\n\nEdit: I didn't smash the bottle, I pushed it off the counter and it broke. I didn't throw it.  \nEdit2: alright, I get it. I'm going to get him $80 worth of stuff to make up for it. But I really don't appreciate being called violent or abusive. I've never hit him once, and I think that's a pretty rash assumption.  \n", "created_utc": 1671757598, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt2hsu/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_boyfriends_vodka/", "score": 8159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've obviously not been set back in your recovery by consuming a trace amount of alcohol in cooked food. If he really thought this was OK, he wasn't being malicious. You can set this as a boundary going ahead if you make it through this conflict, but you were out of line to break the bottle. \n\nAs a general rule, when loved ones upset us, breaking things, punching walls, or otherwise physically venting temper in destructive ways is not a good thing.", "YTA. \n\nplease oh my god, just talk like an adult instead of breaking a bottle of alcohol in a tantrum. you are 26 years old. act like it. just repay him and never speak to him again. \n\nyall aint compatible, and go to therapy. this shouldnt be a normal reaction to your anger.", "So you\u2019re telling me he\u2019s made this for you so many times but you\u2019ve never once seen a vodka bottle out before? He\u2019s not lacing your food with anything, and it does cook away if done properly - which I\u2019m sure he is  doing since he does it so often. \n\nBuy a replacement bottle since you broke it, no matter how much you wanna minimize it. Hitting something which causes it to break means you broke it. YTA", "YTA.  There is no alcohol remaining in the food so he was not \"lacing your food\".

That takes a lot of strength and courage.\n\nBut in this case, YTA although I understand your emotional response. Many people put vodka in pasta sauce -- it's called Tomato Vodka sauce.

But we're literally talking about a tablespoon of vodka in the entire sauce, and much of it boils away. My point is NOT that you're wrong for wanting no alcohol at all in anything you eat. That's your right., It's that you're wrong for how you dealt with it.\n\nYou were wrong to break the bottle of vodka, whether it was a $20 or an $80 bottle. The cost isn't the point. The point is that it's his property, his intentions were good, and you destroyed it in a violent way. Destruction of property is actually on the road to an abusive relationship, so yeah, you need to apologize, and to pay for it.\n\nI get that being a recovering alcoholic is hard & you panicked when you saw that bottle, but you could've asked him not to put even boiled-out vodka in the sauce in the future. It sounds like he would've listened. If you requested him not to and he still did, then he'd be TA.

You break it, you bought it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about the struggles you are going through and it can\u2019t be easy but you broke it you bought it. \n\nPeople in relationships often forget even important things or think about telling their partner something and then think they told them when they didn\u2019t. Usually about small things but can happen about big things too. So I don\u2019t know who is right. But what you could have done is say *\u201coh my goodness I don\u2019t remember that conversation.

Rum cake for example cant get you drunk unless you pour rum AFTER baking it. Yes - you definitely need to pay for that. I can understand you being alcohol-recovering \n, but that does not give you the right to break a bottle for a reason like that. Thats like you going up to a stranger at a restaurant and breaking their margerita glass cuz you didnt want it in your presence. Also, that would be the same as you destroying a rum cake, which is a very good cake because of the rum flavor that doesnt come from the alcohol itself\n\nEDIT - also your bf was following the recipe, you literally could have told him that you werent going to eat that to be safe, and kept it at that.", "We can\u2019t really judge this well without knowing what actually happened.

You can have a disagreement without destroying your SO's property. You need to apologize and pay for the bottle at the very least. I was married to an alcoholic and have zero alcohol in my house as it bothers my kids to see it. My ex was even worse with anger and violence when he would be sober for however long it would last (6 months was the most he ever went). It's called being a dry drunk. Not saying this is you. But if you do find that you reacted in anger and destructive behavior often, you should really get therapy as it can be extremely damaging to relationships. I personally find your behavior in this story to be very controlling and very unsettling as someone who has been on the other side of this.", "YTA!!! The fact that u acted like a kid. Idk if your boyfriend wants you back.. you sound like drama.", "Who really cares how the bottle broke? He is correct for being able to cook off the booze out of the sauce.

It\u2019s not lacing anything and if you think that it is, you need to get on Google and figure out what cooking is. You owe him the money for the item that you broke (which knocking over was in my opinion an abusive move).

It is ON YOU to control your outbursts and your addiction.", "YTA. \n\nAlcohol is an ingredient that cooks away and is only in the final product in very limited quantities. What alcohol is present is also greatly diluted by the other ingredients, so per serving there is almost no alcohol that you consume. You can serve sauce alla vodka to children.

I think you should accept that the sauce did you no harm, even if you don\u2019t want it served to you in the future. You should apologize for your reaction and for destroying something of value because you were angry. You should express your desire for him to apologize to you as well. \n\nBut I do think you overreacted and misbehaved. He should have communicated better but he genuinely wasn\u2019t serving you alcohol in any quantity that\u2019s worth being this upset over.

It's been great, but I let him know from the outset that I was a recovering alcoholic. He had no problem with that, and he still drinks with his friends, but won't do that in my presence. It still bothers me that he drinks, but it's his life, I can't tell him what to do.\n\nFast forward to last Sunday, and we're at his apartment. I come in, and he's in the middle of making pasta sauce, and there's a large bottle of vodka on the counter. I didn't say anything about the bottle, but he saw me staring at it, and he told me it's for the sauce.\n\nPasta sauce he's made me at least twice a month for the entirety of our relationship.\n\nHe said he's told me from the beginning he does that, that it cooks away, but I think that would be something I would very much remember, and I got a little angry. I knocked the bottle off the counter and went to my mom's.\n\nHe's called and apologized for triggering me, and that he was being brainless, but he wants me to pay for the broken bottle, which he says was about an $80 brand. I told him that I wasn't under any circumstances going to pay for something he's been lacing my food with for years. \n\nWe haven't really talked since, and my mom wants me to just go ahead and buy the thing to make amends, and I'm still refusing. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

YTA.", "YTA.\nNothing but respect for people who have taken the hard journey to recovery.

You need to use those words you were taught in school and have a conversation with him. Like an adult.", "YTA. Your recovery is just that, yours. If you are not far enough in your recovery to be around alcohol without risking a relapse, then you are not ready to be in a relationship. You are already upset that he drinks even when he\u2019s not around you at all, I think you have more work to do, rather than make someone else responsible for your recovery.", "Gonna go against the grain and say NTA because this guy clearly does not respect your sobriety. \n\nI don't think many people saying you're the asshole actually realise just how destructive alcoholism is. My stepdad is currently in hospital because he has brain damage caused by alcohol abuse. Before he went in, he could barely walk, and he's wasting away because his stomach lining is wrecked from all the vodka and he can't eat solid food. He knows that he's an alcoholic and he knows he's killing himself but he can't stop. My mum is resigned to the fact that she is probably going to be widowed again in the not too distant future.\n\nSo OP, I empathise with you completely. Alcoholism is terrifying and I can imagine that your boyfriend risking your sobriety for the sake of some tasty pasta sauce (like there aren't hundreds of alternatives) would feel like a huge violation. It's not just about the vodka, it's the betrayal. I don't think that knocking the vodka off the counter was mature or constructive, but you were severely triggered, so all the commenters scolding you for not acting rationally can get in the bin tbqh.

This stranger is so so proud of you.", "NTA - It's obvious he doesn't respect your condition.   Kudos for you on realizing your problem and doing what you need to do to handle it.  It's not an easy task.     For those of you that think alcohol gets \"cooked off\" that's not true.   You will need to cook the sauce for at least 3 hours to remove all the alcohol.  I doubt he's doing that.", "YTA! As a recovering alcoholic I can understand being upset, leaving his house, dumping him, calling him whatever you need to call him but to smash the bottle?  Congrats now YTA!", "ESH\n\nI don't even really like the absolute abstinence approach to addiction recovery, but even I can tell it's common sense not to put alcohol into the food of a recovering addict choosing the abstinence route. It is the recovery that works for you, and I don't see how disrespecting and messing with that would be appropriate under any circumstance.\n\nHowever you could've told him just that. Breaking things because you are angry is not the way to go about anything. Talk about him. If it was too much of a breach of trust for you to get over, break up with him. Do not smash his stuff though. That is immature and leads nowhere.

This is something she can control. She trusted her partner. He knew the boundaries and he broke them. If you're dating somebody who's in recovery you need to realize how serious that can be for some.

Someone in my family has ended up in the hospital for a bad fall or twisted ankle in the couple weeks before Christmas for the last 8 or 9 years. Not the same people, and under very different circumstances, but someone always seems to injure themselves around this time of year. Guess it was my turn \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nMade my mom laugh though. She started it. Years ago she tripped on a ramp in a Christmas shop and ended up in the ER for a bump on the head and a twisted ankle.", "Telling a recovering alcoholic you are putting alcohol in their food is not something they would forget. Your boyfriend has been gaslighting you for years.", "ESH: You should have left instead of weaponizing gravity. \n\nBut I absolutely do not believe that your dude was using eighty dollar vodka in his fucking pasta sauce, for the culinary fucking experience, and just happening to fucking display it to you.", "Actually,  I have a different take on the situation. Her knew you were a recovering alcoholic and should have never had alcohol around you as you requested. For him to put it in your food without your consent,  knowing the issues you have is really awful and shows a lack of respect for you working to overcome alcoholism.  I can see you getting upset and pushing the bottle,  but replace it and the say goodbye. You need a man who respects what you are going through and won't sneak alcohol in your food and respects that you don't want it around. If he really cared for you, he would never have it around you as you requested. Get a man who really cares about your well being more than his drinking.", "I wanna say that your response was emotional and I think to give you the benefit of the doubt you didn't *intentionally* try to break the bottle. However you do need to apologise for breaking it if you haven't already. It's fair of you to compensate him for something of his that you broke.\n\nI *do* think it's kind of weird that after this conversation his first thought is to ask for compensation though, feels like it's not the most appropriate time to ask for it. Because I do think it's weird that he was putting in vodka in the sauce without asking you beforehand whilst knowing your issues with alcohol. And I do think if he told you that that's something as a recovering alcoholic you would remember. I don't understand why people are being so harsh on you for that. I know recovering alcoholics who also don't like being around alcohol or any alcohol in food. They've been 10 years sober. We wouldn't question a vegetarian of their preferences, why would we question an alcoholic? \n\nIf he really was putting alcohol in your sauce without telling you and assumed it was OK coz you never noticed I really think that's not on and you have every right to be upset about it. Obviously smashing a bottle is still not okay but your feelings are valid.", "You do understand all the vodka cooks out right?  You also know they use alcohol for lots of dishes at restaurants right?  He\u2019s not \u201clacing\u201d your food with anything. It\u2019s not like it actually will get you drunk. They serve dishes with vodka sauce to kids at restaurants cause it\u2019s literally that low on alcohol.

You very much over reacted and you could have just said \u201chey that makes me uncomfortable maybe you can make different pasta in the future\u201d but you didn\u2019t you got violent.

But I really don't appreciate being called violent or abusive. I've never hit him once, and I think that's a pretty rash assumption. \n\nHey Fit, I hope these words comfort you as much as they might be a wake up call.\n\nI hate to break it to you, YTA here, but not without some cause.\n\nYou have legitimate reason to be upset, your partner has been knowingly violating a boundary you set, and even if he did not realize that it \"cooking off\" is not enough to make you comfortable. It would have been a more responsible choice to confirm that you were okay with that being an ingredient. Repeatedly until he's absolutely sure you know that it's included every time.\n\nWhen I was in my undergraduate, my thesis focused completely on intimate partner violence, and specifically the rate at which people identify types of abuse against men as abuse.\n\nOne of the most common types of abuse against men, is destruction of property, and/or throwing objects around or at them.\n\nYou don't have to \"hit\" someone to be abusive, the use of violence even against inanimate objects, especially breakable ones, is violence.\n\n**That being said, you haven't relapsed from the pasta sauce.** You were in the wrong here. You need to apologize, buy him a replacement bottle, and **see a therapist.**\n\n**Please, please, see a therapist. Because even if I'm wrong about all of this; nobody realizes they're not handling emotions in a healthy way on their own. A few appointments should be more than enough just to make sure you're being healthy in both how you treat yourself and others.**", "The edits. It doesn't sit right with me that now she's going to reinburse him she's saying \"$80 of stuff to make up for it\" instead of giving him the $80 so he can possibly purchase another bottle. You clearly do have a problem with him not having alcohol in his life so you both need to have a discussion about that.", "Agree YTA. Should have remained calm and used adult skills to manage this. It\u2019s fine to get angry but we need to stop when it gets physical.", "I agree, the whole phrase \"I didn't break the bottle, I knocked it off the counter and it broke\" bit was manipulative in my opinion. OP is not taking accountability for the poor actions OP made on their part and if OP would've handled this like an adult it probably would have gone completely different.

And the attitude that if you slip up with one drink, you\u2019ve lost it all absolutely destroys any chance that an attendee might have had at having a better relationship with alcohol.

A non-nicotine cigarette would just make me want a real cigarette, as an example. I can easily be around smokers now, but it was difficult in the beginning and caused a lot of relapses.

Their brain receptors are more \"greedy\" for the sugar molecules. \n\nYes, there's a lot of drinking culture. Many social events include it. Some in recovery end up feeling pretty hard about that.
