So I took my SIL aside and told her to quit and if she had so much issues with talking to my ex, she should go talk with others people. She promised she\u2019d stop and we left it at that. \n\nBut during yet another conversation, when my ex\u2019s stutter showed again, she said \"So, are you gonna finish that one or should we just move to something else?\" \n\nAt this point I had enough and finally asked her to leave. I told her that if she couldn\u2019t be respectful of my ex\u2019s stutter then her place wasn\u2019t here. She protested and said I couldn\u2019t kick her out of her nephew birthday party but I answered that I could. \nMy husband arrived and also told her to leave to not avoid any further drama. She agreed and left. \n\nOnce everybody left, my husband started yelling that my behavior was embarrassing, that I ruined my son\u2019s party for childish drama and that his parents were now mad at both of us for kicking my SIL out and apparently they said they wouldn\u2019t allow me in their house again if I didn\u2019t apologized to her.", "created_utc": 1686087075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142tx4a/aita_for_asking_my_sil_to_leave_my_son_birthday/", "score": 202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister-in-law is awful, but your problem here is much larger\u2026 your husband is ok with his sister being awful to your child\u2019s dad, and is backing up his family in that the actual problem was you putting a stop to that. \n\nIs he normally a crappy husband who enables his crappy family?", "NTA", "I feel so bad for your ex. You are NTA, but think about how you want your son to grow up. Do you want him seeing his mother\u2019s husbands sister bullying his father and his mother\u2019s husband blaming his mother for defending his father? Or do you want him being raised only by people who respect others, including ones with disabilities? It\u2019s a huge red flag to me that your husband didn\u2019t defend you and instead sided with his family if bullies. Is your husband really the type of person that you want to be the step dad to your son?", "NTA. Would she make fun of a wheelchair user for not being able to get up? A stutter is a disability like any other and your husband and your sil should be embarrassed by their comments.\n\n I'm not saying you should divorce your hubs, but do you really want your child exposed to a man and his family that clearly disdain disabilities and will rub that attitude off on your child? That could be devastating to your child's relationship with either you or with his father. (I'm not a lawyer but to me it sounds like it could also be a case for parental alienation if left unchecked?)\n\nAt the very least you need some couples counseling to establish some respect and some understanding on your spouses end and to establish healthy boundaries in regards to things people can and can't say about your ex or your son in their presence. It's not a joke and you need to get it sorted asap.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt says everything about his family that you had to ask them to do something that would be simple human decency to anyone else.", "NTA. Not only is she setting a horrible example in regards to accepting all types of differences and abilities in general, but if you let her continue, it would show your son it was okay to disrespect his own father. I think you did the right thing not only for your relationship with your ex but his relationship with your son, too. I hope your husband comes around and sets a better example.", "Personally, I would tell your so. \n\nIf you find her being an abusive bully alright. If you find it acceptable to allow her to do so in front of my child. In doing so, teaching him abuse in any form is ok. If your family thinks they have a right to make demands concerning my child and how I refuse to allow abuse in my home or around my child because they are your family I think it's time you moved back in with mommy because we are done. To yell at me, accept her behavior, and think I will allow my child to think being abused is ok means neither you nor your family will ever see either of us again. \n\nThen tell him you will be filing for divorce and go stay with someone taking what's important.\n\nYour nta, but this would be my hill to die on because if you do nothing, what you are teaching your child is abuse is ok. Will you put up with it if it comes to something your son does. Will you teach your son step-dad? He thinks it's ok. Will you allow him to start treating his dad this way.
