I hope your husband comes around and sets a better example.", "Personally, I would tell your so. \n\nIf you find her being an abusive bully alright. If you find it acceptable to allow her to do so in front of my child. In doing so, teaching him abuse in any form is ok. If your family thinks they have a right to make demands concerning my child and how I refuse to allow abuse in my home or around my child because they are your family I think it's time you moved back in with mommy because we are done. To yell at me, accept her behavior, and think I will allow my child to think being abused is ok means neither you nor your family will ever see either of us again. \n\nThen tell him you will be filing for divorce and go stay with someone taking what's important.\n\nYour nta, but this would be my hill to die on because if you do nothing, what you are teaching your child is abuse is ok. Will you put up with it if it comes to something your son does. Will you teach your son step-dad? He thinks it's ok. Will you allow him to start treating his dad this way.
