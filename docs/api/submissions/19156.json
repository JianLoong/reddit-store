I hope your husband comes around and sets a better example.", "Personally, I would tell your so. \n\nIf you find her being an abusive bully alright. If you find it acceptable to allow her to do so in front of my child. In doing so, teaching him abuse in any form is ok. If your family thinks they have a right to make demands concerning my child and how I refuse to allow abuse in my home or around my child because they are your family I think it's time you moved back in with mommy because we are done. To yell at me, accept her behavior, and think I will allow my child to think being abused is ok means neither you nor your family will ever see either of us again. \n\nThen tell him you will be filing for divorce and go stay with someone taking what's important.\n\nYour nta, but this would be my hill to die on because if you do nothing, what you are teaching your child is abuse is ok. Will you put up with it if it comes to something your son does. Will you teach your son step-dad? He thinks it's ok. Will you allow him to start treating his dad this way.

I know there are therapies that can help, my uncle has done a bunch of them.

I think OP is NTA, and that SIL\u2019s behavior as described is indefensible, so \u201chubby getting it kinda right\u201d doesn\u2019t absolve him of doing a 180 immediately after. Its true there might be more info, but based on the info we have that\u2019s the conclusion I\u2019m drawing. \n\nIt would be one thing if SIL did something more benign but acting the way she did is abhorrent in my opinion, especially at a family function for a child. This whole situation is just bizarre to me - for someone to act like that and expect onlookers to back them up boggles my mind and is indicative to me of a rotten person/dynamic, so I\u2019m not being particularly generous with OP\u2019s husband or in laws enabling it either.", "This makes me happy to see \u2014 my kid\u2019s dad & I worked so hard to be healthy coparents we became besties & we are all very happy w our own version of a family. \n\nMy family found issue w it though, along w an array of other things, but it was specifically their negativity towards ALL exes, & also specifically him, that triggered boundaries for them before I had fully digested the whole scope of their toxicity. \n\nAnd OP, this behavior is a big reason as to why neither one of us have ever been all that interested in dating folks \u2014 lots (most?) romantic partners can get real outta sorts over their needs not coming before your kid\u2019s other parent. And there is no one else in the world that\u2019s going to put your kid\u2019s best interests first like your kid\u2019s other parent. I had to learn that lesson a couple times before it stick for good. \n\nCenter you, your kid, & your kid\u2019s other parent\u2019s best interests as you navigate your emotional fallout from some tough revelations. If anyone has issue w that \u2014 they are the problem, not you.", "Speaking about low standards"]}
