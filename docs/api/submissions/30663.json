Am I the asshole?\n\n(Edit) I am a little overweight due to a eating disorder plus a medical condition I have where I don't get as much protien as a normal person does when they eat protien therefore I'm not as full. I have been to the doctor, and a nutritional person and they have both told her it's not enough and she goes with it for about a week and then just stops buying groceries for me. I have to have lots of caffeine to function through my day and I sleep a lot. \n\n(Edit 2) my mom has an app that I can't remove that shows who I text and exactly what I text. She also has it so that I can only call certain people.\n\n(Edit 3) I will be calling CPS tonight. While I am at my dad's with his phone. As I am not able to do it with my own.

You need to call CPS, and if you are worried CPS won\u2019t be fast enough please call the police, you are loosing weight far too fast, your mother is abusing you you are unhealthy because of her actions. Please please seek help, because at the rate you are loosing weight you will very soon loose your ability to function normally.", "Actually you can lose 50# in a month. I dropped 40 in a month because of Graves- I was eating normally. It freaked sucked.", "Yes it can... what she is describing is the result of starvation.  Because this is what her mother is doing to her.  She's starving her.  She could actually kill her at this rate because this can happen.", "We? \n\nAre you a Hive intelligence or so you refer to yourself as \"we\" ?\n\nEdit : and a 17 year old made a typo, are you that pedantic? Or can you just not let it go?", "OP said that 130 is a healthy weight. She did not claim to be 130. She has said consistently that in the course of a month she went from 198 to 150, and that 150 is her current weight. \n\nYou need to learn reading comprehension, because if you think someone telling you how much weight they\u2019ve lost in the past month and what a healthy weight is is then telling you that they actively weigh three different weights, you need to get your eyes and brain checked. \u201cA healthy weight is X\u201d \u201cI\u2019m currently Y\u201d and \u201cI was Z a month ago\u201d are not all saying \u201cI\u2019m currently A.\u201d", "I was heated and upset, that is horrible math \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d correct answer is 260", "You ARE in the school district. Homeschooling still reports to the school district.", "Ty!! I know its a real thing but couldnt think of what its called lol", "I commented before any edits and when the comment was only a few minutes old.\n\nYTA.", "That is a medical condition which I mentioned\u2026", "Not 50 lbs in a month. Even if shes intaking that little calories unless shes a long distance runner.  Thats a daily deficit of of 5833 calories that unless you\u2019re an athlete or have some unheard of metabolism or as I mentioned a medical condition, you wont burn 5k, almost 6k, calories a day.", "Because it was corrected after we did the math. And we because this comment and I did the same thing. \n\nAre you incapable of logical thought?\n\nAlso a 100 lb mathematical error is not \u201cpedantic.\u201d", "She edited her posts after I called her out then blocked me.", "I never defended the mother. Ffs. Learn to read.\n\nI also specified where a doctor would use an extreme restriction. Obviously this situation is not that case. The space between your ears is not storage space for your crayons.", "Suck my cock then and give me a rimjob no one wants to know whether you think I'm an asshole or not. Bet you say \"YTA\" in person too to random folk.", "You are pedantic. Not the correction. You\n\nPlus,  \n\nThe OP  is 17 year old , like ... relax. \n\nAre you that harsh on everyone,  I mean your responses seem impersonal to the point of whole awkwardness.\n\nAlso,  who is \"we\" . You apparently couldn't answer that question.", "I never said you defended the mother I said you're trying to defend the ideology. Big fucking difference you big Dumbo. You learn to read. \n\nYou did reference a very specific situation which was 800 calories, not 500. I haven't verified if that's true or not so I'll take your word for it.\n\nIf doctors rarely recommend these types of weight losses. What makes you think a random psycho woman can force their 17 year old child to stick to 500? You nutter", "Op, I'm currently trying to lose weight. I weighed 192lbs at the beginning of the year. I currently weigh 163lbs. A healthy amount of calories you should be eating to lose 1lbs a week would be 500 calories less than you are BURNING a day. So if you burn 2000 calories a day, you should be eating 1500 calories. 500x7days a week=3500 3500 calories=1lbs. \n\nAnything more than that is VERY difficult for even an adult. You are a growing kid who needs more calories just to exist.\n\nI'm sorry you have such an abusive mother. Stop taking any supplements she is giving you unless you know 100% what it does for you.", "OP I wouldn't bother reading or replying to anything else from this idiot, and if he DMs you (he seems the type) block him. \n\nIdk what his problem is but he shouldn't be bullying you. It doesn't even matter what you weigh, 500 calories a day isn't enough for anyone, and a Caesar salad has almost no nutrition. This will cause long term damage to your body and organs. This is starving. Your mom is starving you, and frankly I'm deeply concerned by some of your other comments as well since she seems to control every aspect of your life from who you can contact to keeping your medical records from you. I'm sorry your Dad is ignoring that you're being abused. \n\nThe people who are supposed to be nurturing and protecting you are not doing so, so you need to find a way to protect yourself ASAP, whether that's going to live with your bf or through CPS, or through anyone else who can help you."]}
