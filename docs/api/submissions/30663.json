World's greatest dad you've got there. \n\n500 calories is less than half of what you need. On that amount of calories your body is constantly in starvation mode which means if you aren't burning it instantly then your body is automatically turning it into fat as it doesn't know when it'll eat again. \n\nYou need to speak to social services as this is child abuse.

Tell your mom that you WILL call CPS if she doesn't stop restricing your food.  Doctor will have your back.  \n\nOther route is... take matters into your own hands.  You are 17 so she can't physically restrict or control what goes into your body.  You HAVE food in the house, what's wrong if you just eat it?  You CAN go to the store and buy your own food. You CAN eat out when you are out of the house. A chicken breast, some toast, a salad, doesn't cost much.  Can you get a small part time job? \n\nYour mom is ridiculous and harmful and abusive.

I didn't even say the op needs to diet. \n\nI was pointing out that average caloric needs are based on maintaining a healthy weight. I was also pointing out that doctors can, and have, used extreme caloric restriction to reduce weight when needed. At least one case on 600 lb life that I watched recently had a gal on a strict 800 calorie diet.
