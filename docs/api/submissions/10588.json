{"id": 10588, "submission_id": "118mi20", "title": "AITA if I report a Uni classmate for getting a medical certificate for \"mental health and burnout issues\" so she could defer an exam to attend a BTS concert?", "selftext": "A classmate was out sick last year when we had a mid semester exam.\n\nShe happened to come up as a recommended person on my instagram today and I got curious and looked at her profile. She clearly was not sick. She was overseas at a BTS concert literally 2 days after the exam. She posted pics a month later as a \"throwback\", but I know the dates of the concert because I like BTS too!\n\nI asked a friend who is her friend and was in the same class, she said \"*yeah, she got the tickets but knew they wouldn't let her defer the exam for a concert, so she telehealth-ed a medical certificate for a week and used that*\". Out university expects you put university first and will not give extensions for holidays, concerts, birthdays etc. \n\nWhen I asked my friend why she didn't report her, she shrugged and said it wasn't her business and I should stay out if it.\n\nBut is is extremely unfair because I didn't try to go to that concert because I knew I had the exam and had to put Uni and my commitment to the class before a concert. Yet she got to do it. When I said that, my friend said \"it's not that deep, there is more to live than Uni, let it go\". \n\nI asked another friend who is also good friends with her and she told me back to hell off because she is on a support plan due to depression from her sister dying a few months earlier and told the doctor she was burned out and just needed a week off and that she said \"whether she takes that week off in Australia or abroad is none of the University's business\". She can't be that burned out if she can fly overseas!\n\nI really think this is unfair and she needs to face repercussions from the University as she got more time for the studies AND got to do a social event instead of her exam when we are expected to put Uni first.\n\nATIA for reporting this?", "created_utc": 1677032972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118mi20/aita_if_i_report_a_uni_classmate_for_getting_a/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you want the same then take the risk, if not then keep you head down and study when you're supposed to study, tough titties. Mind your own business. If you need a selfish reason not to report her, as I suspect you do,  nobody likes a narc. Your friends will lose respect for you and stop trusting you, and will likely tell your coursemates.

She clearly was not sick. She was overseas at a BTS concert literally 2 days after the exam. She posted pics a month later as a \"throwback\", but I know the dates of the concert because I like BTS too!\n\nI asked a friend who is her friend and was in the same class, she said \"*yeah, she got the tickets but knew they wouldn't let her defer the exam for a concert, so she telehealth-ed a medical certificate for a week and used that*\". Out university expects you put university first and will not give extensions for holidays, concerts, birthdays etc. \n\nWhen I asked my friend why she didn't report her, she shrugged and said it wasn't her business and I should stay out if it.\n\nBut is is extremely unfair because I didn't try to go to that concert because I knew I had the exam and had to put Uni and my commitment to the class before a concert. Yet she got to do it. When I said that, my friend said \"it's not that deep, there is more to live than Uni, let it go\". \n\nI asked another friend who is also good friends with her and she told me back to hell off because she is on a support plan due to depression from her sister dying a few months earlier and told the doctor she was burned out and just needed a week off and that she said \"whether she takes that week off in Australia or abroad is none of the University's business\". She can't be that burned out if she can fly overseas!\n\nI really think this is unfair and she needs to face repercussions from the University as she got more time for the studies AND got to do a social event instead of her exam when we are expected to put Uni first.\n\nATIA for reporting this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I encourage my students taking a 'mental health day' (in that my students have four free days to use a semester, and they can use them for ANY reason--they don't need to lie and say a relative died or something--they can literally take all four days to just vibe) to go to the beach, and stress the importance of mental health, but she's being really dismissive of the people who need serious help and profs working with them and the whole mental health system that has built up in college. She's kind of making a mockery out of all that, if you're being truthful about her motivation.  Taking advantage of a policy that is meant to help students in serious crisis is a dick move.\n\nAgain, if you're being honest in your appraisal, she's a dick AND you're a dick.

I must say I am surprised at the nasty tone of some of the comments here, particularly from one person claiming to be a uni instructor. The fact of the matter is that the friend is involved in fraudulent behaviour and has used a health service that may also be issuing fraudulent certificates (these are often investigated and legal action taken against practices). We don't know what degree the student is studying, but student misconduct like this could be enough to prevent professional accreditation in some professions.\n\nIt's unclear form the original post, but I don't believe the death of the sister took place before the concert, so people arguing that this is 'self care' due to that may not be correct. If I am wrong, then the student could have applied for a deferred exam on compassionate grounds as per the relevant policy (each University will have one).\n\nYour University may have a student code of conduct that will give details of your responsibility to call out behaviour, and I would suggest you discuss this in confidence with a University support worker.\n\nIs it a nice thing to tell on a friend?

Personally I wouldn't really mind if she did completely lie about needing a breka just to go, like it's a relatively harmless way to game the system.

As someone who took medical leave from a university for an entire year due to a cancer diagnosis, I find this VERY infuriating and I\u2019d be inclined to report it too. There are students out there who have real problems. It\u2019s usually not easy for students to get exam accommodations due to mental health and disabilities.

But I still had fun and honestly, those concerts did more for my mental health than weeks of therapy ever could have. Doing something fun like seeing my fave band was exactly what I needed because it reminded me that Life Goes On (no pun intended) and that there are many things to live for. \n\nGrieving doesn't mean you can't be happy at moments, and the emotional energy required to take a light to go to a concert is very different to the emotional energy needed for work to school.\n\nYou sound like the kind of person who doesn't believe you're depressed or still grieving unless you are lying in bed crying every waking moment of the day.", "My dad went on \u201cthe fishing trip of a lifetime\u201d right after his father passed.

Does someone have to be completely incoherent to be 'unwell enough' for you? Does depression and grieving come with a symptom of being unable to lie? \n\nI bet she wasn't even lying.

Your employer is not allowed to ask why, and it\u2019s not against their policy for you to take vacation or do ANYTHING you want to on that leave.
