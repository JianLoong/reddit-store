{"id": 10588, "submission_id": "118mi20", "title": "AITA if I report a Uni classmate for getting a medical certificate for \"mental health and burnout issues\" so she could defer an exam to attend a BTS concert?", "selftext": "A classmate was out sick last year when we had a mid semester exam.\n\nShe happened to come up as a recommended person on my instagram today and I got curious and looked at her profile. She clearly was not sick. She was overseas at a BTS concert literally 2 days after the exam. She posted pics a month later as a \"throwback\", but I know the dates of the concert because I like BTS too!\n\nI asked a friend who is her friend and was in the same class, she said \"*yeah, she got the tickets but knew they wouldn't let her defer the exam for a concert, so she telehealth-ed a medical certificate for a week and used that*\". Out university expects you put university first and will not give extensions for holidays, concerts, birthdays etc. \n\nWhen I asked my friend why she didn't report her, she shrugged and said it wasn't her business and I should stay out if it.\n\nBut is is extremely unfair because I didn't try to go to that concert because I knew I had the exam and had to put Uni and my commitment to the class before a concert. Yet she got to do it. When I said that, my friend said \"it's not that deep, there is more to live than Uni, let it go\". \n\nI asked another friend who is also good friends with her and she told me back to hell off because she is on a support plan due to depression from her sister dying a few months earlier and told the doctor she was burned out and just needed a week off and that she said \"whether she takes that week off in Australia or abroad is none of the University's business\". She can't be that burned out if she can fly overseas!\n\nI really think this is unfair and she needs to face repercussions from the University as she got more time for the studies AND got to do a social event instead of her exam when we are expected to put Uni first.\n\nATIA for reporting this?", "created_utc": 1677032972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118mi20/aita_if_i_report_a_uni_classmate_for_getting_a/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you want the same then take the risk, if not then keep you head down and study when you're supposed to study, tough titties. Mind your own business. If you need a selfish reason not to report her, as I suspect you do,  nobody likes a narc. Your friends will lose respect for you and stop trusting you, and will likely tell your coursemates.

She clearly was not sick. She was overseas at a BTS concert literally 2 days after the exam. She posted pics a month later as a \"throwback\", but I know the dates of the concert because I like BTS too!\n\nI asked a friend who is her friend and was in the same class, she said \"*yeah, she got the tickets but knew they wouldn't let her defer the exam for a concert, so she telehealth-ed a medical certificate for a week and used that*\". Out university expects you put university first and will not give extensions for holidays, concerts, birthdays etc. \n\nWhen I asked my friend why she didn't report her, she shrugged and said it wasn't her business and I should stay out if it.\n\nBut is is extremely unfair because I didn't try to go to that concert because I knew I had the exam and had to put Uni and my commitment to the class before a concert. Yet she got to do it. When I said that, my friend said \"it's not that deep, there is more to live than Uni, let it go\". \n\nI asked another friend who is also good friends with her and she told me back to hell off because she is on a support plan due to depression from her sister dying a few months earlier and told the doctor she was burned out and just needed a week off and that she said \"whether she takes that week off in Australia or abroad is none of the University's business\". She can't be that burned out if she can fly overseas!\n\nI really think this is unfair and she needs to face repercussions from the University as she got more time for the studies AND got to do a social event instead of her exam when we are expected to put Uni first.\n\nATIA for reporting this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You do realize that any employer will only give a few days off, maybe a week, for a death in the family and expect you to be back at your job performing to expections.\n\nGrieving does not absolve you from your responsibilities, nor is it an reason not to fulfill them or an excuse to skip a test several months after the death in question, nor a justification for committing some form of academic fraud.", "So you admit that she can still be grieving? Then why did you claim earlier that she's \"clearly not still grieving her sister\" because she went to a concert?", "Lol. Taking FMLA leave is very common at workplaces. Your employer is not allowed to ask why, and it\u2019s not against their policy for you to take vacation or do ANYTHING you want to on that leave.

What's your thought process behind \"someone did something fun, they must not be grieving\"?", "Soft YTA\n\nI understand why you're so upset. But I think there are two important things to consider here:\n\nFirst, burnout doesn't mean you need to stay home to recuperate. Some people recover by doing nothing. Some people recover by being active. Some even do everything possible to take their mind off things. \n\nNow do I believe this concert was just 100% coincidentally scheduled on the same week your friend needed a mental health break? No. But do I believe that someone who recently lost a relative and is having a continuing mental health crisis might benefit from getting out of the house and doing something fun? Yes. Both things can be equally true. \n\nSecond, I don't think the consequences are worth it in this instance. You friend could end up failing the class and might lose her place in the university. Given that she recently lost a sibling, she's likely already struggled more in the class than most students, so she's not getting that much of an edge by having more study time. Ditching a class for a concert might not be the most ethical thing--assuming she isn't also using this as a legit mental health break--but I don't think she deserves to face consequences this severe.", "YTA!

I hit my limit and then found out my mom was back in the hospital and my dad was divorcing her. I wasn't handling it well.

How were extra sessions not an accommodation? Blows my mind."]}
