I can absolutely understand why you feel about him the way that you do. But she had her own relationship with him, even if it was a relationship recent one, and if she is grieving, that is something she needs to deal with. There's nothing helpful that preventing her from attending will do, either for her or for you... it's just a manifestation of your own anger with him. Well, you have every right to be angry with him, but not to take it out on your daughter, which is what you're doing by preventing her from attending. It doesn't hurt him any -- it only hurts her. \n\n Funerals aren't for the dead, who aren't there any more to experience them. They're for the living, to help them manage their grief and the other complicated feelings surrounding the loss of the deceased. It sounds as if your daughter has plenty of reason to have more complicated feelings than most, so the funeral could be, perhaps, even more helpful to her than for someone whose grief is more straightforward. \n\nShe's just lost her father, and there's a lot going on in her heart and mind about that -- a lot of different, sometimes contradictory feelings. Preventing her from addressing those feelings won't help her, and won't even hurt him, since he's not there to know it. What good does it do to stop her from attending? What purpose are you trying to achieve? Because I don't see anything positive that you're going to get from it.", "YTA Your relationship with her father may of been bad and abusive, but your daughter has her own relationship with her father.

You robbed her of that.", "YTA\n\nListen, your ex is no saint, but he's the only father she has. You don't get to dictate the kind of relationship she has with him, especially since she's old enough to decide that for herself. Part of being a good parent is trying to facilitate a healthy relationship between your child and their other parent regardless of how YOU feel. \n\nHis funeral was, very likely, an important part of her grieving process. At the end of the day it's not about him or how terrible he was. It's about your daughter and the support that she needed from you. In stopping her from attending that funeral, you denied her that support.\n\nETA: I understand that he was abusive and that will affect the kind of relationship you want your child to have with him for her own safety and well-being, but he is dead now.

I'm sorry that your abuser was kept in your life through his child.

Bad decision.", "Yta you denied her a moment of closure", "NTA my mother was raped and my brother a product of that rape did not attend his fathers funeral. Grooming is along the same lines. I think you didn\u2019t have a open dialogue about what happened to you and allowed your daughter to be close to him. My grandmother told my brother who his dad was on a drunk night. Then my mother sat him down and explained his birth and how much she loved him. Then she explained to me what happened and why as little kids she always asked us if anyone touched our pocket books, she did the same for my brother. He died when my brother was 17, my mom said she wasn\u2019t attending and let him make the choice. He said he wasn\u2019t going. \n\nPeople that are born from trauma should know how they came about. I don\u2019t agree with my mom holding it a secret. My brother struggled to come to terms for a while thst he was a product of rape. He knew we loved him, but he said he felt dirty with that man\u2019s blood in him. Thankfully he moved past that, at least to my knowledge. \n\nI personally don\u2019t know why anyone would want a relationship with someone like that , but some kids do because their parents said nothing. Then are surprised they are upset that they let them bond with monsters. \n\n\nI think you should invest in family counseling to explain to your daughter why you said no.

OP\u2019s ex was a monster. I cannot imagine wanting a relationship with someone who treated my mother that way. And saying \u201cdad was right about you\u201d was disgusting behavior from her daughter.

You didn't give her the chance to deal with him dying in a way she felt was needed and very possibly robbed yourself the ability to have peace after what happened to you based off what your daughter said about him being right. You could have let her go on her own and been there for her when she got home, you have explained your side but when dealing with death rarely is it a good thing to pull out all the bad to a person who is grieving. Rational thinking goes out the window in those cases", "YTA... I am SO sorry for your experiences \ud83d\udc9b but your experiences are not your daughters experiences. As others have said, she will resent you for this for a very long time. Try to find a way to make it up to her. I've heard of having a tree planted in someone's memory. My aunt buys prayer cards for the families of people who have passed. Just a couple ideas. It's not for him, it's not about him. It's about helping your daughter heal from this loss. It may not be about her losing what sounds like probably a shitty dad, it may be about all the lost possibilities. She had just reconnected with him. She may have had (unrealistic) dreams of a future with an ideal dad. Graduation, walking her down the aisle, etc.", "YTA but very softly. Your pain is real and your concerns and any anger you may have or still have towards him are very valid. But your daughter had a different relationship and may be grieving. Maybe in the future she will see what type of person her father was but she's 16 right now and just lost a father who had decided to come back to her. She may have longed for a father all those years he was absent and she lost him again. Even if he was absolute shit, the closure she needs with the relationship she had with him is different from yours.\n\n\nI hope you and your daughter can work this out and that she can come to understand the person her father was. \n\n\nIs she or your mother aware of your past with him? And the reasoning of why you kept her from the funeral?", "I am going with NAH, because, well, the one who could have been an asshole is dead.\nWe're talking about a 16 y-o girl who had a daughter with a 31 y-o man. This is wrong, and I get why OP is mad, and why OP doesn't want him around. Abussive? I will never doubt it.\nHowever, he's dead. It's like, he can't do any more damage right now. I don't know the reasons why this man was in OP's daughter's life, but having him there and banning her to assist her funeral is something I can't see the point. I will understand OP fighting for avoiding a relationship between her daughter and this man, totally. But, once he's passed away, I really don't see the point in doing something like this. She will grow and understand, but, until that, stop using her as a tool for a revenge.", "YTA. I understand your POV, but she needed that closure.", "I get why I really do that's why Gentle YATA but you punished your daughter for the problem you had with her father she wanted to say goodbye and you took that away of course she is angry now", "YTA. Your daughter will definitely go no contact with you. No matter how you felt, to her that was her father. That was the last time she could say goodbye. He\u2019s dead, he can\u2019t hurt you. If you didn\u2019t want to go then that\u2019s fine, but your daughter should\u2019ve had a choice and you\u2019ve ripped that from her. Everything was about you and what you wanted. You were selfish and didn\u2019t care about how this would impact your daughter.", "I think you made a mistake not letting her go, and I would suggest you think about how to approach doing something with your daughter that honours that he was her dad, he is a part of her regardless of your feelings for him, in fact she may even be hurting and feeling the rejection you have for him as a rejection of her. She's 16, this is the moment where the memories matter. \n\nYou obviously have a lot to reconcile within yourself but try to put yourself in her place, after 13 years of no father she starts to tentatively get to know the guy who is 50% of her, then he dies a few years later. What future did she envisage with him in her life? It might be worth you both attending counselling to try to move forward.  \n\nGood luck op. Sadly the asshole died on this one and left you, yet again, holding the baton.", "Gentle YTA   I fully understand why you thought this was the right call. Because it was the right call for you. However, your daughters experience with this man was not yours. And the closure from a funeral may have been something she really needed to heal. You took that choice away from her.  I do think you had the best of intentions but you were only looking at the situation from your own personal perspective. You didn\u2019t consider hers.", "YTA.

You can't fix this you fucked up royally.", "YTA\n\nThis should have been entirely her choice...why couldn't you let her say a final goodbye? Would it have changed anything?  He's dead anyway...the only person you've hurt is your child by using her absence to make a statement. But this wasn't about you or your trauma.", "NAH. He's dead, you probably would have been better off letting her go. What would have been the harm?", "YTA you can't force people to not go to a funeral. Either explain to her the real reasons why you feel tha she shouldn't go, or let her get some closure. I presume you went which also raises some questions?", "Seriously? YTA.

Can\u2019t believe this.\n\nETA: I read post and calmed down a bit. So I can understand your feelings, but you have no right to put your stuff on her.

I know a lot of people that would consider this grounds to go nc, especially because I have to wonder if she's this controlling over something that she doesn't have to participate in, just how controlling she is in other areas. Now! It is possible that she did try to prevent the rwo having a relationship and couldn't for court reasons or something - in that case I do lean e s h. Once more.
