I can absolutely understand why you feel about him the way that you do. But she had her own relationship with him, even if it was a relationship recent one, and if she is grieving, that is something she needs to deal with. There's nothing helpful that preventing her from attending will do, either for her or for you... it's just a manifestation of your own anger with him. Well, you have every right to be angry with him, but not to take it out on your daughter, which is what you're doing by preventing her from attending. It doesn't hurt him any -- it only hurts her. \n\n Funerals aren't for the dead, who aren't there any more to experience them. They're for the living, to help them manage their grief and the other complicated feelings surrounding the loss of the deceased. It sounds as if your daughter has plenty of reason to have more complicated feelings than most, so the funeral could be, perhaps, even more helpful to her than for someone whose grief is more straightforward. \n\nShe's just lost her father, and there's a lot going on in her heart and mind about that -- a lot of different, sometimes contradictory feelings. Preventing her from addressing those feelings won't help her, and won't even hurt him, since he's not there to know it. What good does it do to stop her from attending? What purpose are you trying to achieve? Because I don't see anything positive that you're going to get from it.", "YTA Your relationship with her father may of been bad and abusive, but your daughter has her own relationship with her father.

You robbed her of that.", "YTA\n\nListen, your ex is no saint, but he's the only father she has. You don't get to dictate the kind of relationship she has with him, especially since she's old enough to decide that for herself. Part of being a good parent is trying to facilitate a healthy relationship between your child and their other parent regardless of how YOU feel. \n\nHis funeral was, very likely, an important part of her grieving process. At the end of the day it's not about him or how terrible he was. It's about your daughter and the support that she needed from you. In stopping her from attending that funeral, you denied her that support.\n\nETA: I understand that he was abusive and that will affect the kind of relationship you want your child to have with him for her own safety and well-being, but he is dead now. He certain can't hurt her or you, and letting her go to the funeral wouldn't put her in harms way.", "INFO: how many years has her father been in her life?

I'm sorry that your abuser was kept in your life through his child. And you have every reason not to forgive him or attend his funeral.\n\nBut you are an AH for not having compassion for your daughter who has lost her father. Her relationship with him is not your relationship with him.

Bad decision.", "Yta you denied her a moment of closure", "NTA my mother was raped and my brother a product of that rape did not attend his fathers funeral. Grooming is along the same lines. I think you didn\u2019t have a open dialogue about what happened to you and allowed your daughter to be close to him. My grandmother told my brother who his dad was on a drunk night. Then my mother sat him down and explained his birth and how much she loved him. Then she explained to me what happened and why as little kids she always asked us if anyone touched our pocket books, she did the same for my brother. He died when my brother was 17, my mom said she wasn\u2019t attending and let him make the choice. He said he wasn\u2019t going. \n\nPeople that are born from trauma should know how they came about. I don\u2019t agree with my mom holding it a secret. My brother struggled to come to terms for a while thst he was a product of rape. He knew we loved him, but he said he felt dirty with that man\u2019s blood in him. Thankfully he moved past that, at least to my knowledge. \n\nI personally don\u2019t know why anyone would want a relationship with someone like that , but some kids do because their parents said nothing. Then are surprised they are upset that they let them bond with monsters. \n\n\nI think you should invest in family counseling to explain to your daughter why you said no. She doesn\u2019t see your trauma and doesn\u2019t understand.

OP\u2019s ex was a monster. I cannot imagine wanting a relationship with someone who treated my mother that way. And saying \u201cdad was right about you\u201d was disgusting behavior from her daughter. She\u2019s a child (much like OP was when she was groomed by an adult man twice her age), dealing with the death of her father who had a complicated role in her life, so I can\u2019t call her an AH.

You didn't give her the chance to deal with him dying in a way she felt was needed and very possibly robbed yourself the ability to have peace after what happened to you based off what your daughter said about him being right. You could have let her go on her own and been there for her when she got home, you have explained your side but when dealing with death rarely is it a good thing to pull out all the bad to a person who is grieving. Rational thinking goes out the window in those cases", "YTA... I am SO sorry for your experiences \ud83d\udc9b but your experiences are not your daughters experiences. As others have said, she will resent you for this for a very long time. Try to find a way to make it up to her. I've heard of having a tree planted in someone's memory. My aunt buys prayer cards for the families of people who have passed. Just a couple ideas. It's not for him, it's not about him. It's about helping your daughter heal from this loss. It may not be about her losing what sounds like probably a shitty dad, it may be about all the lost possibilities. She had just reconnected with him. She may have had (unrealistic) dreams of a future with an ideal dad. Graduation, walking her down the aisle, etc.", "YTA but very softly. Your pain is real and your concerns and any anger you may have or still have towards him are very valid. But your daughter had a different relationship and may be grieving. Maybe in the future she will see what type of person her father was but she's 16 right now and just lost a father who had decided to come back to her. She may have longed for a father all those years he was absent and she lost him again. Even if he was absolute shit, the closure she needs with the relationship she had with him is different from yours.\n\n\nI hope you and your daughter can work this out and that she can come to understand the person her father was. \n\n\nIs she or your mother aware of your past with him? And the reasoning of why you kept her from the funeral?", "I am going with NAH, because, well, the one who could have been an asshole is dead.\nWe're talking about a 16 y-o girl who had a daughter with a 31 y-o man. This is wrong, and I get why OP is mad, and why OP doesn't want him around. Abussive? I will never doubt it.\nHowever, he's dead. It's like, he can't do any more damage right now. I don't know the reasons why this man was in OP's daughter's life, but having him there and banning her to assist her funeral is something I can't see the point. I will understand OP fighting for avoiding a relationship between her daughter and this man, totally. But, once he's passed away, I really don't see the point in doing something like this. She will grow and understand, but, until that, stop using her as a tool for a revenge.", "YTA. I understand your POV, but she needed that closure.", "I get why I really do that's why Gentle YATA but you punished your daughter for the problem you had with her father she wanted to say goodbye and you took that away of course she is angry now", "YTA. Your daughter will definitely go no contact with you. No matter how you felt, to her that was her father. That was the last time she could say goodbye. He\u2019s dead, he can\u2019t hurt you. If you didn\u2019t want to go then that\u2019s fine, but your daughter should\u2019ve had a choice and you\u2019ve ripped that from her. Everything was about you and what you wanted. You were selfish and didn\u2019t care about how this would impact your daughter.", "I think you made a mistake not letting her go, and I would suggest you think about how to approach doing something with your daughter that honours that he was her dad, he is a part of her regardless of your feelings for him, in fact she may even be hurting and feeling the rejection you have for him as a rejection of her. She's 16, this is the moment where the memories matter. \n\nYou obviously have a lot to reconcile within yourself but try to put yourself in her place, after 13 years of no father she starts to tentatively get to know the guy who is 50% of her, then he dies a few years later. What future did she envisage with him in her life? It might be worth you both attending counselling to try to move forward.  \n\nGood luck op. Sadly the asshole died on this one and left you, yet again, holding the baton.", "Gentle YTA   I fully understand why you thought this was the right call. Because it was the right call for you. However, your daughters experience with this man was not yours. And the closure from a funeral may have been something she really needed to heal. You took that choice away from her.  I do think you had the best of intentions but you were only looking at the situation from your own personal perspective. You didn\u2019t consider hers.", "YTA. Whatever issues you had with her father he was your daughters father and you denied her closure and grieving with other family members. You can't fix this you fucked up royally.", "YTA\n\nThis should have been entirely her choice...why couldn't you let her say a final goodbye? Would it have changed anything?  He's dead anyway...the only person you've hurt is your child by using her absence to make a statement. But this wasn't about you or your trauma.", "NAH. He's dead, you probably would have been better off letting her go. What would have been the harm?", "YTA you can't force people to not go to a funeral. Either explain to her the real reasons why you feel tha she shouldn't go, or let her get some closure. I presume you went which also raises some questions?", "Seriously? YTA.

Can\u2019t believe this.\n\nETA: I read post and calmed down a bit. So I can understand your feelings, but you have no right to put your stuff on her. This said from someone who had a bit of a crappy dad, but still went through grieving process when dad died- there are so many aspects/things you can grieve, that to make a decision for someone else like this is not the way to go.", "YTA\n\nI get where you\u2019re coming from OP but ultimately this was her decision that you took from her.

I can see how your ex was able to groom you, with a mother like that. \n\nPlease make peace with your daughter so she has one good influence in her life, who isn't an abusive father or a narcissistic grandmother.\n\nVery, very gently, YTA, but only because she had the right to grieve in her own way. I don't blame you for trying to keep her far away from her father. I am very suspicious of why he would suddenly take an interest after your daughter reached puberty and I wonder if his death saved her from something much worse.\n\nYour daughter is angry because let's face it, she lost her father long before this. You're simply the most convenient target for her anger. Give her time and therapy. Hopefully she will come around.", "Gentle YTA. First of all, I\u2019m so sorry you were groomed and had your child so young. He\u2019s gone now and your daughter still lost her father and needs support. You both do. I don\u2019t think this issue is worth possibly ruining your relationship with her.", "YTA.\n\nYou put your hatred of him over your daughter, over her mental wellbeing and over her chance of closure. What he did to you doesn't change the fact he's her dad. She's too young to understand the magnitude of what her dad did, all she understands is that her dad is gone and you are the reason that she didn't get to say goodbye. There was nothing saying that you had to go so why couldn't she?", "YTA I understand you might not have wanted the reminder of the ex due to him being abusive, BUT your daughter had a right to go to her fathers funeral whatever kind of father he may have been or not been. People sometimes need closure, your daughter has every right to be angry and hurt that you've prevented her getting that.", "YTA.   You are actually pretty horrible for this, everyone needs closure you took that away from your daughter.", "YTA.   It doesn't hurt him any -- it only hurts her. Funerals aren't for the dead, who aren't there any more to experience them.", "YTA at the very least in your daughters eyes. No matter what he did to you", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nListen, your ex is no saint, but he's the only father she has.", ">She could also hate him and still decide to go to his funeral\n\nYep. I have a lot of unresolved anger and hurt towards my father who abandoned me and whom I had only seen twice in the last twenty years and I still cried when he died and attended the zoom funeral. I didn't want to regret not doing so later down the line.", "YTA. I'm sorry that happened to you. But he is still her father.", "Well I mean, she's probably going to hold onto any bad decisions or the like he convinced her on out of pure spite towards her mom now, so there's that....", "I think there's quite a strong case for shunning a 31ish year old man who gets a 15/16 year old pregnant. \n\nI don't expect a 16 year old to get it though  and I agree with the yta vote, she should have been allowed to go to her dad's funeral.", "When she turned 13, and he'd see her maybe a couple of times every few months.", "The mother\u2019s trauma should not be passed on to the daughter.", "I agree. I'm a child born from rape and human trafficking and I could not imagine telling my mother that I was going to his funeral to remember him.\n\nRapists do not deserve to have their lives celebrated.", "You mean he raped her. Let\u2019s call it what it is. When a 31 year old has sex with a 16 year old, it\u2019s rape.", "As someone who was born out of rape too, PREACH. I saw what my mother went through from my bio father and I wouldn't dream of telling her that I was going to remember him or celebrate his life in any way.", ">Some deaths aren\u2019t meant to be celebrated, and when mine goes, I sure as hell will not be attending\n\nThat's entirely your choice to make, but OP's daughter wasn't given the choice.", "Op is TA because she took her daughter's right to closure over her father's death. The daughter will have regrets over being forced to miss her own father's funeral for the rest of her life. That is heavy trauma that can't be undone. And Op caused that hurt for her daughter", "Look, no matter the judgement, calling it \"whatever issues you had\" seriously minimizes his actions and the trauma she experienced. This wasn't the case of parents fighting with each other. She was an underaged victim and now her daughter wanted to go to her abusers victim. I don't agree with the way OP handled this situation, but I also don't unverstand why OPs daughter event wanted contact with her mom's abuser. And I can't even imagine how hard it must have been for OP to see her daughter loving OPs abuser.", "Why would you assume she went?", "can't believe the amount of ytas who clearly don't have personal experience with abuse of this calibre", "Depending on how OP was groomed, that may not have been an option regardless of legality. Too many young women get groomed in religious communities and the groomers typically have the full support of family and the community.\n\nThat said, abortion should be legal and accessible to all ages without parental permission.", "Read the post.  This is such a dumb response.", "(Daughter is 16)", "YTA. It's about your daughter and the support that she needed from you. In stopping her from attending that funeral, you denied her that support.", "/u/Diligdjk stole this partial comment from: /u/spacemonkeypantz \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zywe97/aita_for_not_allowing_my_16_yr_old_daughter_to_go/j287bfv/\n\nBot Reported.", "He's also *dead*. The time to protect her from him was when he came back into her life, not as he's leaving it.", "The spite towards her mom now specifically comes from the moms actions and decisions, not from the dead father.", "There's no one to shame though. He no longer exists.", "I hope these visits were supervised by a trusted adult. It sounds like you both need therapy.", "Too late?  Not sure why you think it wasn't already?", "of course i was trying to say it in a way to not bring bad memories up for her\n\ni dont want op to think this is a attack for her\n\nshe is a victim and needs help", "THANK YOU THIS SUB IS SOOOOO WEIRD DUDE", "Right?! \n\nThe facts: A 31 year old male got a 16 year old pregnant. \n\nDisappears until she\u2019s a teenager and magically wants to be in her life *that\u2019s really shady shit right there*", "Yes, maybe it should be a YTA\nI get the fact she was groomed was a really strong trigger for her, but, still, I don't get why was this man in her life.", "This survivor will tell you this- your trauma is an explanation but not an excuse to take away this opportunity from your child. Especially because they wanted it and now \"dad was right!\"\n\nYou sure this fracture can be fixed? Op allowed her trauma to damage something for the living. \n\nIf her daughter claims this was abuse, how will Op respond?", "OP's abuse doesn't negate the fact that that man was the daughters dad. She's allowed to have her own feelings.", "I can\u2019t believe the fact you don\u2019t see that he\u2019s still her father and she needs to be able to say goodbye. This is not about either of the parents. It\u2019s about the daughter. Good god.", "The way you said it minimized her experiences. She just refused her daughter to go to the man\u2019s funeral, and you think calling it like it is, is going to be the thing that brings up bad memories?", "i misread it and thought he was the mother's dad, my mistake", "i misread it and thought he was the mother's dad, my mistake", "i misread it and thought he was the mother's dad, my mistake"]}
