However, she refers to them as \"creeps\" and talks about how annoying it is to receive their attention. I understand that some of the messages might be unwanted, but I noticed that she tends to generalize and stereotype these boys based on their interest in her.\n\nOne day, while she was scrolling through her messages, I told her to be nicer to these boys because they might be good people and might just be shy or nervous. I also explained to her that everyone deserves to be treated with respect, and it's not fair to label someone as a \"creep\" just because they're interested in her. However, my daughter disagreed and said that it's her right to choose who she talks to, and she doesn't owe anyone anything.\n\nI can see where she's coming from, but I still think it's important to treat everyone with kindness, even if we don't share the same interests. I also worry that her attitude might be hurting these boys' feelings and self-esteem.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my daughter to be nicer to the \"creeps\"?", "created_utc": 1677533580, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dnk0g/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_to_be_nicer_to_the/", "score": 316, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nDear Reddit community,\n\nI (39F) had a recent disagreement with my daughter (16F) about how she treats certain people, and I'm not sure if I was in the wrong, so I\u2019m coming to you all for some clarity.\n\nMy daughter is a popular girl at school and often receives messages from boys who are interested in her. However, she refers to them as \"creeps\" and talks about how annoying it is to receive their attention. I understand that some of the messages might be unwanted, but I noticed that she tends to generalize and stereotype these boys based on their interest in her.\n\nOne day, while she was scrolling through her messages, I told her to be nicer to these boys because they might be good people and might just be shy or nervous. I also explained to her that everyone deserves to be treated with respect, and it's not fair to label someone as a \"creep\" just because they're interested in her. However, my daughter disagreed and said that it's her right to choose who she talks to, and she doesn't owe anyone anything.\n\nI can see where she's coming from, but I still think it's important to treat everyone with kindness, even if we don't share the same interests. I also worry that her attitude might be hurting these boys' feelings and self-esteem.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my daughter to be nicer to the \"creeps\"?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even if they're being respectful, if she doesn't want them contacting her she has a right to call them creeps, because that's what they are to her.", "They're 16 and their is a culture where boys try to get the \"hard to get\" girl or continue to harass every time she says no. Without context you can't be so quick to say they didn't do anything wrong.", "See a lot of people making quite a few assumptions of this one.  But your point is true, and actually more along the lines of what I was thinking.", "No that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, she shouldn\u2019t have to be nice to people if they are harassing her, she doesn\u2019t owe them the time of day.", "That is attention. She does not owe them that.", "Fr, JoesWastedTime and 90% of the other people in this sub are reading a different post than I did.  When did he say his daughter owed anyone anything besides politeness and empathy?", "Ok now YTA for sure. This is madness.", "She 100% does not owe anyone anything. However, if someone is respectfully and kindly trying to say hi to her or ask her out, then she should kindly and respectfully tell them no. If that guy then gets aggressive and gross, then yes he\u2019s a major creep.", "OP says 2 of them just said \"Hello, I know you from X, would you like to go out sometime?\"\n\nThat's not a creep.", "Men and women should be mindful of others feelings, it should not be a women only thing.", "From OP\u2019s posts they are creepy/do not require a response", "So stop people calling it body autonomy and sexual assault etc here from a few msgs from children to each other. Talk about jumping the gun.", "Another comment a bit further down. Which makes OP's parenting absolutely disgusting", "YTA \u2014 these aren\u2019t all efforts to take her on an actual date like you made it seem in the original post. leaving comments on her being \u201chot\u201d isn\u2019t an invitation to go on a date. nor is a random boy messaging her and asking her to make out. that is creepy. you need to step out of what YOU may find flattering and realize that it is making your daughter uncomfortable. and she\u2019s entitled not to accept this CREEPY behavior", "Honestly even the nicer ones could be creepy if there was something that happened in person. You don\u2019t know how those boys act every day in school. Especially since she probably only gave them her number for school purposes and then they used it for other things, I can see being a little snappy to make sure her No isn\u2019t pushed back on.", ">One was a guy from class asking if she\u2019d like to make out with him. She said that was the \u201ccreepiest\u201d one.\n\nI mean, yeah, someone just asking that out of the blue is not a good idea in most contexts. That's at best poor social skills, but could also be objectification/harassment. Your daughter is in the best position to judge which, based on what she's observed from these people before.", "Your daughter is telling you that she is receiving unwanted, sexualized attention from her male peers that makes her uncomfortable. It really doesn't matter whether you feel like the messages are creepy, because *she* is the one receiving them, and *she* feels that they are creepy. In response, you tell her she should be nicer to them. This completely invalidates her experience of being harassed by these messages, *and* tells her that you don't have her back when she needs you to help her set boundaries, which she has the right to do. As a woman, actually nice guys don't ask you out out of the blue just because they think you're hot. The good ones get to know you, try to figure out if you like them too, and then feel out whether you'd be interested in going on a date.\n\nYou might also consider that your daughter, as a teen, might have a better gauge for how creepy a message is, because 1) there's a lot of implicit and subtextual communication that is inherent to the way that modern teens communicate in text and 2) she's a young woman who is being bombarded with objectifying messages by her peers, social media, and mainstream media. \n\nYTA", "Imho she has every right to call them creeps cause they are behaving like creeps.", "That is creepy. If she\u2019s very uncomfortable with this attention she can make her socials private and block numbers that are unfamiliar so she doesn\u2019t get texts from strangers. She\u2019ll have to be discerning about who she gives her information to and ensure she gets theirs. And for kids in class and group projects it will be necessary to set up firm boundaries. 16 is not too old to start doing this anyway. Good luck!", "If she is getting messages that truly worry her, tell her to come to you or a school counselor and that you will protect her and have her back 100%. \n\nSometimes innocent messages turn scary VERY quickly and she does need to prioritize her safety and if she\u2019s getting just \u201clet\u2019s get a coffee sometime\u201d messages, then give her a good script to turn down guys nicely (because it takes a lot of guts to ask someone out!) but after she turns them down, if they are still insistent and turn aggressive, she needs to know you\u2019re a safe person to come to and that\u2019ll you\u2019ll support her and not \u201ctell her to be nicer.\u201d", "Just fyi since I\u2019m assuming Instagram wasn\u2019t around when you were in HS\n\nthe boys that dm you calling you hot or cute or whatever, are very 100% trying to f*ck your daughter and make it so uncomfy to post. Your daughter most likely is just trying post her life w her friends and random boys from her school are using that to comment on her body and try to get w her. She should shut that down", "Ew ew ew all of that is disgusting. Why are you prioritizing these boys who don't respect her than your daughter's comfort and safety?", "To a young woman / why she may find these messages creepy: \n\n\"I think you're pretty\" (read: I don't know you well, you haven't offered any encouragement, and I'm sexualizing you based on your appearance) \"and I think we should go out\" (read: I'm telling you, not asking, and I'm implying my wants and desires are the only ones that matter). \n\n\"I think you're hot/cute\" (read: I don't know you well or at all, you havent offered any encouragement, but you look good and I want to f*ck you) \n\n\"I'm in your class. Would you like to make out with me?\" (Read: we dont know each other well, and you havent encouraged me, but im watching you, maybe I'm stalking you, I'm definitely sexualizing you, and any subsequent encouragement would probably have me following you after class and continuing to make inappropriate suggestions, possibly unwanted touching or harassment)", "OP has clarified in comments that the boys call her hot on her Instagram and ask her on dates, and at least one was wanting to make out with her.

That's a pretty harsh and weighty accusation to throw at a classmate who wants to go out for pizza and accepts \"No\" for an answer. Actualy predators? Flame on.\n\nClassmates you just don't want to date who aren't predators but you have nothing in common with? Maybe find another kind of language so as not to use her position as a \"popular girl\" to salt the earth for them with everyone else at school.", ">Unwanted/unsolicited attention isn't nice\n\nSo, you can't give someone attention, unless they solicit it. But wouldn't the solicitation itself be unwanted unless you solicit their solicitation first? Which you also can't do unless they solicit the solicitation of their solicitation. How does that work in practice?", "So many people on here are just all or nothing type people.\n\n\"So you're telling her to sleep with the creeps?!?!\"\n\n\"No, I'm telling you not to call everyone a creep.\"", "TBF, OP could have put what they were saying in the post, like he did in the comments.  But the amount of people automatically assuming she is talking about actual creeps and isn't some rude teenager is just mind-boggling.\n\nIt's like they've never met a teenage girl. If they hit her DM and she doesn't have a crush on them they are \"creeps\" and that's not how you raise your kids. \n\nShe doesn't have to reply.. but she shouldn't be talking smack about people who have done no wrong, either.", "They're not being respectful.", "Unless she didn't give them her contact info, hasnt spoken to them, and hasn't solicited contact in any way. A random contact asking for a date can feel threatening to a young woman. She is well within her rights to ignore unsolicited contact.", "Just because the message it\u2019s self isn\u2019t creepy doesn\u2019t mean the boy haven\u2019t acted out of pocket before.", "On this we agree. It often is not the case. As demonstrated by the OP, who is prioritizing the hypothetical feelings of a bunch of boys over the actual feelings of their daughter.", "Okay, I'll change my vote. From how the mom wrote it, I was just getting \"mean girl\" vibes from the daughter, but it seems she is an unreliable narrator.", "She has done zero wrong. Your attitude is why girls and young women suffer so much every day.", "Did OP provide examples? I think that will really make my mind up for me.", "Yeah.
