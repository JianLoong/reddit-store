Also make sure he knows that his mom's idea is very sound advice and that many parents would have forced that lesson on their kid, out of love. You both felt love and respect and showed it in different ways, and he should know that just because one was more fun, it doesn't mean it came from more love.", "NTA\n\nThat $500 is essentially his first earning. By allowing him to spend it as he chooses, he'll learn the joy of reaping the benefits of his hard work. This will motivate him to work harder in the future.\n\nBut this is also a great opportunity to teach him about savings. Personal savings, mind you -- not his college fund.\n\nMaybe suggest that he could save $100 of the total instead of spending it all in one go. That way, if something new comes along that he's interested in, he'll also be able to buy that.", "You are not really the ah but this would have been a great time to teach him to be responsible and to only spend part of the the money and save some of it maybe 1/2, maybe 2/3 or so...", "Are you an AH? No, not exactly. Are you teaching your son responsible spending habits? Absolutely not.", "NTA when my daughter earned her first \u201cpaycheck\u201d as a kid I encouraged her to treat herself and spend it on what ever she wanted, and then I would teach her about investing and savings on her next. So we talked and we came up with a plan for her about percentages and through our her childhood she has become quite the entrepreneur. She blames it on being a Taurus but that girl is rabid about her investment accounts and rarely spends her money unless it is a part of her plan. No impulse buying for her unless mom is footing the bill lol. And no she does not abuse the system I just treat her every now and again. But you son sold his first piece of work that should be celebrated.", "NTA omg it\u2019s 500$ not 50000$ he\u2019s 12 he shouldn\u2019t be expected to put money he earned himself into a savings or college fund as his parents that\u2019s your responsibility right now. Does she expect to keep his birthday or holiday money too? Let him be a kid if he bought video games cool let him be happy. Your 12 year old kid literally sold his first script he\u2019s a playwright ! That\u2019s so awesome!! And seriously you are such an awesome dad for encouraging him to pitch it to the school in the first place ! It really is a huge accomplishment for him I\u2019m glad you made the choice to let him enjoy the money.", "NTA. Your teaching your son an invaluable lesson for his age: that creativity+hard work = Great reward. This will motivate him so much (just don't let him get too addicted to video games)\n\nYou're awesome, if you can afford it, put the $500 down in his stead, could be worth it just to get them to stop harping", "NTA this is a 13 year old CHILD. He earned that and he shouldn't have to worry about starting his own college fund. That is what he has parents for. This mentality of making children pay their own way while they are children is gross. Would it have been a good opportunity to teach money management? Maybe but again he is 13. Letting him enjoy his childhood is important too.", "NTA. But as someone with zero financial education, it would have been a great time to teach about spending. I remember being that age and earning enough somehow to buy the $250 bmx bike I wanted but I wasn't really taught about saving or anything like that. \n\nSide note it is super rad that they performed your kids play, and if I were you I would invest in professional writing classes.", "NTA. His intellectual property = his money. YWBTA if you didn\u2019t allow him to choose how he spent it.", "$500 doesn\u2019t mean jack shit when it comes to a college fund. Let him have his money and everyone else can STFU about it. If they want a college fund for the boy, they can open their wallets. It\u2019s not the job of 13 year old boy to pay for college. If he even wants to go. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThat's lot of money for a 13Y/O, I would have advised him to put away half of it. But in the end he earned it and he gets to do with his money what he wants.", "NTA. He made the money he can spend it. That is how the world works.", "NTA at all. This was his first big thing, let him have fun but after this maybe try to talk to him and teach him about how it\u2019s the best thing for him to try and save and manage his money especially starting at 13 he could set himself up very nicely in due time. Sounds like his stories and gift of writing get a lot of support and praise and that\u2019s just what a kid needs to boost his ego and want to do it even more. You\u2019re doing great! Don\u2019t doubt yourself \n- A fellow parent (mama)", "NTA\n\nYou let him spend his first earnings on fun things he wanted.\n\nIt's none of his mother's business.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA\nWow he earned money as a writer at that age!! Thats encredable and yesbhe should get to do what he likes with it. Perhaps next time, save some, but this is his very first \"pay check'", "NTA sure, you could have suggested this to him as an option. He did something amazing and should be able to splurge on something fun. That said if it turns into a thing for him where he regularly gets paid for this then saving some isn\u2019t unreasonable", "NAH but I agree with his mother. When you get some unexpected money, a little bit goes to treats and the rest into savings/debts etc. Jack won't get as much out those video games as he could have from saving that money towards something like his first car, going travelling, or even towards his education.", "NTA. Of course it would be great if you can advice him of this as another option and its importance. I mean, other options he could do is to invest a portion of his money. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s his money so it is his decision how he should spend it.\n\n- I\u2019m almost double his age and I would also spend part of this money on games \ud83d\ude02", "NTA and Well done to your son!!!", "NTA technically but definitely a missed opportunity. Could have been a chance for him to learn about creative income--you should never EVER spend the full amount you receive for your writing. It's taxed at up to 40%, and many many writers I know have blown all the money and then freaked out when they owed the government $$$ 8 months later. I also take a portion of every writing paycheck and put it toward retirement (and then you owe less to the government)... of course you wouldn't have a 13-year-old do that (or pay taxes), but having him save, say, 30% of it could have been illustrative. Generally speaking teens should be learning saving and budgeting skills... \n\nBut earning his first paycheck from his writing is incredible and to be celebrated, for sure! Definitely give him a chat about 1099 earnings and taxes for the future. Also if he becomes a pro-screenwriter he'll have a manager and/or agent and pay them a percentage, as well. Smart money skills are essential if you're going to make a creative pursuit your living.", "NTA \n\nWhat a great taste of earning his own money \n\nAnd on his own creation!\n\nCongratulations to your son!\n\nAnd kudos to the principal for standing by the ethics and paying for student work.", "YTA for essentially encouraging him to blow all that money as a 13yo. Better would have been suggest he save at least half of it for his future.", "NTA I don't know what the future plans for college are, but my child's earnings were theirs. They earned it.", "NTA, he\u2019s a kid and he can do whatever he wants with the money that he rightfully earned! From a parent perspective, it may have been a good moment to teach financial responsibility and lay out all the options for him though. Even if it was dividing it up into savings and spending money.", "You're NTA. My advice? You should have \"taxed\" that $500 and put the \"tax\" in his college fund or some kind of savings. That way he learns the joy of earning money doing what he loves, learns how taxes work/feel, learns how to save a little, and has some spending cash.", "NTA\n\nOne, he's thirteen and have five years to think about college. If he doesn't want to go, that would be a waste.\n\nTwo, while it's fine to encourage him to get a savings account, forcing him to save would give him an unhealthy relationship with money.\n\nThree, who would have access to this account? If there's an issue, get him a piggy bank or take him to get a savings account and a bank safety box.", "NTA\n\nSchooling is important, but it\u2019s also important to show your child hard work pays off. You allowed him to enjoy the fruits of his labour and as such have likely encouraged him to work harder in the future towards his passion. More so now that he\u2019s proven to make money from it. He\u2019ll have opportunities to put money aside for schooling if he decides to get a job and pay his way. \n\nAlso $500 doesn\u2019t get you text books for all your classes, let your son enjoy his money.", "Hm... He is 15 years old , not so young and that's his first money so I think he deserves to spend them as he wishes. I'll go with NTA", "NTA, taking your kids' money away is just gonna make your kids not tell you they have money.\n\nHe worked for it, and he put in the hours and the effort. It is HIS money. And it's HIS choice to spend it on what he chooses.\n\nYou putting the money away for college to him is the same as taking it away because he won't even notice it for 7 or so years.\n\nKids aren't stupid, and personally, I'd be offended by the statement \"I can't believe you let your kid spend his money\"\n\nSorry if I sound heated. As a kid, My parents, and my friends parents did the same stuff. And we absolutely hated it.\n\nHe is a kid. Let him be a kid.", "NTA. He's 12, let him enjoy it. There is plenty of time for life lessons later", "NTA he earned it let him spend it.", "NTA You had the choice between letting him spend the money how he wanted to, or requiring/suggesting he set some or all of it away as savings.  \n\n\nEither option is acceptable. You still have time to teach him about savings next time he earns some money.", "NTA\n\nI actually strongly disagree with your wife and everyone saying you are squandering a teaching moment. This is a windfall and your son is (rightfully) excited. By forcing a teaching moment you risk making your son resentful instead.\n\nIf your son hated vegetables and you forced him to eat a giant plate of them you might get some short term nutrients in him but you'd hardly build a lasting habit. He'd simply never eat them when you weren't around, and possibly might avoid eating around you. Instead you'd talk to him about why is good to eat vegetables, and try to figure out how to cook them so he enjoys then.\n\nLikewise, teaching kids about money should be about education, not something you impose on him when he's come into some money. Show him your budget. Talk about what you do with windfalls when they happen to you. Let him take initiative to handle his money responsibly (while keeping in mind he has time). If you convince him it's a worthwhile thing to do, you'll have better long term results.", "NTA\n\nIn fact I often see it suggested that when you get your first paypacket to blow the lot and then  start your savings plan from the second one.\n\nJack has just done this from a younger age than some people.\n\nI can see where his mom is coming from though but she's not necessarily right.\n\nI would probably sit down with Jack and teach him about money and budgeting.  This is not a single lesson but one learnt over time because he's learning a lot by watching what you do.\n\nPerhaps encourage him to save 50-70% of his earnings and he can't spend the rest on whatever he likes.  He can save up for something bigger with that 25% he has to spend.  Or spend the lot when he gets paid.\n\nThis will be more relevant once he gets a part time job rather than one offs like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A third to savings, a third to non negociables that may come up during the month and a third for whatever he wants but it has to last the month.

When he gets a part time job at 16 and makes more money, we'll rearrange his savings and stuff, but it will always be his choice.

With the average game costing $59.99-$69.99, $500 is only going to get you about 5 games.

It's great he did this and can most likely do it again. But teach him money responsibility now.

When younger, I got my first pay check that was 800\u20ac. I got to spent it all as I pleased. It might've been good teaching point, but I don't think it made me irresponsible with money.

Ofcourse if you never teach this to him, then you will be an asshole.", "NAH but this would have been a great opportunity to teach him how to save money. He could have out a portion of it into savings and spent the rest. \n\nIf he has any of the money left maybe it could be used for something to do with his writing.

A conversation about spending/saving should happen, and there\u2019s no evidence here that there wasn\u2019t one so I\u2019ll give the benefit of the doubt.

HOWEVER, I personally would've let him have half to spend and half to save, but that's me.", "NTA - and these comments are off-the-chain ridiculous.  First of all, it's convenient his part-time mother wants him to invest in his college fund.  What is she contributing?  Quite frankly, if you want to teach your children responsible spending habits, you lead by example.  He should make sure he's saving for his son's future, and express to his son that he should do the same thing with any future children.  An unexpected $500 windfall to a 13 year old?  Save it for a car or for college?  Have some of you people actually looked what a halfway decent used car goes for these days? how about one semester of community college?  At 13 he does not have the means or ability to save for his future.  That falls on his parents, let the kid be a kid.  You mini Dave Ramsey's need to remember that $500 at 13 versus $500 at 18 are completely different things and I commend the dad for letting his son be a kid.", "NTA - it was a great experience for him. I bet he loved it and he got the reward for doing so. Now he is motivated to keep going. Money comes and goes but experiences are forever.", "I mean, technically NTA, but you really should've gotten him to save some of it or consider if he could do something really special with that much money (even more screenwriting classes).", "NTA - this time let him get a taste of what his talents can do. If he does anything similar in the future and gets money from it, that is the time to sit down and talk about saving a portion. This time was about him getting a reward for something few his age would be comfortable doing. Encourage more of it in the future, but this time I'd let it serve as an encouragement to exercise his talents.", "NTA. Let the kid have his indulgence. This was an unexpected reward for his endeavours. If he sells more of his writing, encourage him to save and invest in his own future.

Yes it's only $50 but putting 10% in savings js a good habit to develop.", "NTA\n\nThink a lot of people are forgetting how they felt when they were a child. You can instill good spending habits, without taking half of his money. And especially the first paycheck? This is where he begins to truly understand the value of money.", "Absolutely NTA. Well done to your son. I'm sure you and your son are very proud.\n\nWhile I understand what his mother wanted to do with the money is also a good idea. This is your son's first earnings, I agree with him being able to spend it however he wants. Maybe with his next earnings he could put that towards his future.\n\nThank you for encouraging your son to put himself out there and to pursue his passions.", "NTA. He earned it, he deserves to spend it. Let him feel the reward for his hard work. Maybe set aside the same amount in a college fund, so he has that in the future. But most importantly, he\u2019s too young to be a worried adult, worrying about where the next piece of food comes from. Let him live  and dream.\n\nLet him be a kid.

The other has always saved it all up.\n\nWhen the 7 year old bought a set of goal posts and football with his savings, and still had lots left over, and the 13 year old realised she had nothing to show for her chores except lipgloss, tic-tacs and a few t-shirts, she started to put 75% into savings and allow herself 25% to play with.\n\nAll without my input.\n\nIf I had just said \u201cyou have to save at least 50% of your allowance\u201d it wouldn\u2019t have had the same impact. \n\nFail small now with a safety net, learn lessons, do better next time when the safety net won\u2019t be there and the consequences are bigger.", "Nta.

Most kids don't learn this until they get a job.", "NTA. That is your son's money. He should be allowed to spend it. If it was meant for college or savings (like as a gift from family or inherited-specifically for that), I would say it should be put in an account. But that's not the case. Your son earned that money by his own work and effort. \n\nShould you teach him responsible spending habits? Of course. All parents should. But even adults splurge at times and buy things they don't need or spend more than they should. \n\nMaybe if this happens again, you can talk with your son and agree to set aside a percentage of it for savings and then let him spend some too. He would learn good money habits and also enjoy the money he earned. \n\nAlso... this encourages and supports your son's dream. It gives him real experience with the type of writing he wants to do. It will build confidence and help his skills grow. Your boy had every right to be over the moon.", "NAH Couldn't you have compromised and put half in an account and allowing him to spend the other half?", "NTA- but you could have used it as a teaching moment about saving. I make my son (now 16) put 10% of every dollar he earns into his savings acct. when he is 18 we\u2019ll open him up an IRA. You\u2019re never too young to have a financial literacy discussion.

It was awesome.\n\nDo with that information what you wish.", "NTA he earned it, now he gets to enjoy the fruits of it. There's time to still encourage him to learn more about savings etc, he's just a kid who has experienced the euphoria of his first pay.", "NAH.

You could have used it as a teaching moment. 1/2 goes into savings. 1/4 gets put aside for his future purchases.  1/4 gets spent now on games, etc.", "NTA.  I see both sides.  The thing is that your son learned a valuable life lesson and value of work and his worth providing a service all needed when he gets into the job market.  He saw the benefit of earning that money and the rewards afterwards.  Now, if  he earns more money in the future it's up to you to teach him to save and plan for the future.  Letting him spend on a one off is not harmful and hope he had a good time but there is work to be done now teaching him how to manage money.", "Oh!! I have some experience here!\n\n\n\nAs a kid, I entered a short story contest and won first prize, $300. My mom wanted me to put the money in her account for safekeeping, my stepdad wanted the money in my savings account he had for me, and my dad wanted me to keep it. \n\n\nI got to keep it, because I had worked hard and earned the money without their aid or guidance. However, my stepdad cautioned me against spending the whole thing at once, and in the end, I put $100 away in his savings for my future. I was able to pay for a part of my community college with that account, not all of it, but some. The other $200 went to some books I wanted, a few toys, and miscellaneous things. \n\n\nMaybe mention the possibility of being responsible with a portion of his earnings to him, and walk him through it.

He did well in selling his first script so young!", "Smart parenting would have saved some (ie college or apartment fund), spent some, and put money away for some reach goal (new phone, computer, tablet, car).\n\nHe is of an age to start understanding budgeting and the value of money. You did him no favors spending it all frivolously.", "NTA\n\nI am also going to play devil's advocate, your son worked hard on this play and earned his money. He is young let him spend his money how he likes, would it be long term beneficial for him to save all his money? Yes. Is it the fun thing to do with all that hard work? No. Teaching him that his hard work has equalled money and that money has equalled fun I think is a pretty valid lesson to learn.", "NTA- I think saving part of it is always good, but he should be allowed to spend some of it.

I\u2019m a firm believer that unless you have pressing bills or debts, your first paycheque, especially when only 13, should be blown in whatever manner the earner chooses. Future paycheques can be put towards savings, etc. but the first one, that should be fun.", "Agreed with this, let him have some fun but encourage putting a portion away for his personal savings.

We also use this idea now with our kids, just to teach them some value of money and planning.", "Personally, I would have had him save a portion, and keep a portion to spend on whatever.\n\nETA: also, selling his screenplay alone is already going to look great to recruiters when he pursues higher education after high school, so congrats to him!", "My parents would have made me save half and let me spend the other half.  Easy solution, and teaches a valuable lesson.", "This.

Before the money was spent, I hope OP at least helped his son really think about what he was purchasing before he let him loose.", "At 13 spending your money like this CAN be a lesson.  I took a few hundred I had saved up and blew it about this time in my life on video games.  A few months later when it came time to buy new shoes for basketball season my mom told me I could only get the new Jordans if I could pay the difference between them and a regular decent pair.  Had I not spent it all I could have had some shoes I really wanted with money left over, or like 1-2 of the games I bought plus the shoes.   It was my first real lesson in always having a backup fund.  Especially because half the games I bought were crap I only played a couple times anyway and the off brand auto-fire gamepad I bought ended up breaking after a month.", "[deleted]", "YTA.\n\nLearning responsible financial management is not 'outdated'. It is the difference between future financial security or instability. What was wasted here was less the actual dollar amount and more the opportunity to have a conversation with the son about the value of money and have him make informed choices about how to spend, save or otherwise allocate income. Hopefully OP can provide better support for his son next time. \n\nAlso, since the possibility of a monetary reward played zero part of his decision to write a play in the first place, it is farcical to suggest you will only stir his creativity with the promise of money.

Having a play I had written actually performed would activate my \"reward circuits\" far more effectively than $500.", "The 1/3 to do a theater course could go to something above what the parents typically pay for. There are some really incredible performing arts camps but they're typically really costly. I did this for music camps in school (scholarships + birthday money savings), which my family wouldn't be able to afford otherwise.

People are acting like this one moment dooms this kid to financial mismanagement for the rest of his life. It\u2019s his first paycheck. Let him blow it on dumb, fun stuff, and teach the value of saving and budgeting as you go without making saving be a punishment but rather a part of enjoying your hard work. This is not a one-off teaching moment, but a lifetime parenting lesson. The lesson of have some fun when you\u2019ve earned it and occasionally indulge yourself when you can isn\u2019t awful, either. Not like the kid is failing to pay the mortgage. Besides, this may honestly be very dependent on his parents finances. $500 may not be a huge amount to them, the kid may not need to save for a car or college, etc if parents are covering it.

This was an opportunity for the father to teach his son in so many ways: he could taught him about splitting the check in part savings, part buying something useful, part fun money, he could have told him to think about buying something expensive he really wanted, considering he is unlikely to have that much disposable cash anytime soon.
