Also make sure he knows that his mom's idea is very sound advice and that many parents would have forced that lesson on their kid, out of love. You both felt love and respect and showed it in different ways, and he should know that just because one was more fun, it doesn't mean it came from more love.", "NTA\n\nThat $500 is essentially his first earning. By allowing him to spend it as he chooses, he'll learn the joy of reaping the benefits of his hard work. This will motivate him to work harder in the future.\n\nBut this is also a great opportunity to teach him about savings. Personal savings, mind you -- not his college fund.\n\nMaybe suggest that he could save $100 of the total instead of spending it all in one go. That way, if something new comes along that he's interested in, he'll also be able to buy that.", "You are not really the ah but this would have been a great time to teach him to be responsible and to only spend part of the the money and save some of it maybe 1/2, maybe 2/3 or so...", "Are you an AH? No, not exactly. Are you teaching your son responsible spending habits? Absolutely not.", "NTA when my daughter earned her first \u201cpaycheck\u201d as a kid I encouraged her to treat herself and spend it on what ever she wanted, and then I would teach her about investing and savings on her next. So we talked and we came up with a plan for her about percentages and through our her childhood she has become quite the entrepreneur. She blames it on being a Taurus but that girl is rabid about her investment accounts and rarely spends her money unless it is a part of her plan. No impulse buying for her unless mom is footing the bill lol. And no she does not abuse the system I just treat her every now and again. But you son sold his first piece of work that should be celebrated.", "NTA omg it\u2019s 500$ not 50000$ he\u2019s 12 he shouldn\u2019t be expected to put money he earned himself into a savings or college fund as his parents that\u2019s your responsibility right now. Does she expect to keep his birthday or holiday money too? Let him be a kid if he bought video games cool let him be happy. Your 12 year old kid literally sold his first script he\u2019s a playwright ! That\u2019s so awesome!! And seriously you are such an awesome dad for encouraging him to pitch it to the school in the first place ! It really is a huge accomplishment for him I\u2019m glad you made the choice to let him enjoy the money.", "NTA. Your teaching your son an invaluable lesson for his age: that creativity+hard work = Great reward. This will motivate him so much (just don't let him get too addicted to video games)\n\nYou're awesome, if you can afford it, put the $500 down in his stead, could be worth it just to get them to stop harping", "NTA this is a 13 year old CHILD. He earned that and he shouldn't have to worry about starting his own college fund. That is what he has parents for. This mentality of making children pay their own way while they are children is gross. Would it have been a good opportunity to teach money management? Maybe but again he is 13. Letting him enjoy his childhood is important too.", "NTA. But as someone with zero financial education, it would have been a great time to teach about spending. I remember being that age and earning enough somehow to buy the $250 bmx bike I wanted but I wasn't really taught about saving or anything like that. \n\nSide note it is super rad that they performed your kids play, and if I were you I would invest in professional writing classes.", "NTA. His intellectual property = his money. YWBTA if you didn\u2019t allow him to choose how he spent it.", "$500 doesn\u2019t mean jack shit when it comes to a college fund. Let him have his money and everyone else can STFU about it. If they want a college fund for the boy, they can open their wallets. It\u2019s not the job of 13 year old boy to pay for college. If he even wants to go. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThat's lot of money for a 13Y/O, I would have advised him to put away half of it. But in the end he earned it and he gets to do with his money what he wants.", "NTA. He made the money he can spend it. That is how the world works.", "NTA at all. This was his first big thing, let him have fun but after this maybe try to talk to him and teach him about how it\u2019s the best thing for him to try and save and manage his money especially starting at 13 he could set himself up very nicely in due time. Sounds like his stories and gift of writing get a lot of support and praise and that\u2019s just what a kid needs to boost his ego and want to do it even more. You\u2019re doing great! Don\u2019t doubt yourself \n- A fellow parent (mama)", "NTA\n\nYou let him spend his first earnings on fun things he wanted.\n\nIt's none of his mother's business.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA\nWow he earned money as a writer at that age!! Thats encredable and yesbhe should get to do what he likes with it. Perhaps next time, save some, but this is his very first \"pay check'", "NTA sure, you could have suggested this to him as an option. He did something amazing and should be able to splurge on something fun. That said if it turns into a thing for him where he regularly gets paid for this then saving some isn\u2019t unreasonable", "NAH but I agree with his mother. When you get some unexpected money, a little bit goes to treats and the rest into savings/debts etc. Jack won't get as much out those video games as he could have from saving that money towards something like his first car, going travelling, or even towards his education.", "NTA. Of course it would be great if you can advice him of this as another option and its importance. I mean, other options he could do is to invest a portion of his money. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s his money so it is his decision how he should spend it.\n\n- I\u2019m almost double his age and I would also spend part of this money on games \ud83d\ude02", "NTA and Well done to your son!!!", "NTA technically but definitely a missed opportunity. Could have been a chance for him to learn about creative income--you should never EVER spend the full amount you receive for your writing. It's taxed at up to 40%, and many many writers I know have blown all the money and then freaked out when they owed the government $$$ 8 months later. I also take a portion of every writing paycheck and put it toward retirement (and then you owe less to the government)... of course you wouldn't have a 13-year-old do that (or pay taxes), but having him save, say, 30% of it could have been illustrative. Generally speaking teens should be learning saving and budgeting skills... \n\nBut earning his first paycheck from his writing is incredible and to be celebrated, for sure! Definitely give him a chat about 1099 earnings and taxes for the future. Also if he becomes a pro-screenwriter he'll have a manager and/or agent and pay them a percentage, as well. Smart money skills are essential if you're going to make a creative pursuit your living.", "NTA \n\nWhat a great taste of earning his own money \n\nAnd on his own creation!\n\nCongratulations to your son!\n\nAnd kudos to the principal for standing by the ethics and paying for student work.", "YTA for essentially encouraging him to blow all that money as a 13yo. Better would have been suggest he save at least half of it for his future.", "NTA I don't know what the future plans for college are, but my child's earnings were theirs. They earned it.", "NTA, he\u2019s a kid and he can do whatever he wants with the money that he rightfully earned! From a parent perspective, it may have been a good moment to teach financial responsibility and lay out all the options for him though. Even if it was dividing it up into savings and spending money.", "You're NTA. My advice? You should have \"taxed\" that $500 and put the \"tax\" in his college fund or some kind of savings. That way he learns the joy of earning money doing what he loves, learns how taxes work/feel, learns how to save a little, and has some spending cash.", "NTA\n\nOne, he's thirteen and have five years to think about college. If he doesn't want to go, that would be a waste.\n\nTwo, while it's fine to encourage him to get a savings account, forcing him to save would give him an unhealthy relationship with money.\n\nThree, who would have access to this account? If there's an issue, get him a piggy bank or take him to get a savings account and a bank safety box.", "NTA\n\nSchooling is important, but it\u2019s also important to show your child hard work pays off. You allowed him to enjoy the fruits of his labour and as such have likely encouraged him to work harder in the future towards his passion. More so now that he\u2019s proven to make money from it. He\u2019ll have opportunities to put money aside for schooling if he decides to get a job and pay his way. \n\nAlso $500 doesn\u2019t get you text books for all your classes, let your son enjoy his money.", "Hm... He is 15 years old , not so young and that's his first money so I think he deserves to spend them as he wishes. I'll go with NTA", "NTA, taking your kids' money away is just gonna make your kids not tell you they have money.\n\nHe worked for it, and he put in the hours and the effort. It is HIS money. And it's HIS choice to spend it on what he chooses.\n\nYou putting the money away for college to him is the same as taking it away because he won't even notice it for 7 or so years.\n\nKids aren't stupid, and personally, I'd be offended by the statement \"I can't believe you let your kid spend his money\"\n\nSorry if I sound heated. As a kid, My parents, and my friends parents did the same stuff. And we absolutely hated it.\n\nHe is a kid. Let him be a kid.", "NTA. He's 12, let him enjoy it. There is plenty of time for life lessons later", "NTA he earned it let him spend it.", "NTA You had the choice between letting him spend the money how he wanted to, or requiring/suggesting he set some or all of it away as savings.  \n\n\nEither option is acceptable. You still have time to teach him about savings next time he earns some money.", "NTA\n\nI actually strongly disagree with your wife and everyone saying you are squandering a teaching moment. This is a windfall and your son is (rightfully) excited. By forcing a teaching moment you risk making your son resentful instead.\n\nIf your son hated vegetables and you forced him to eat a giant plate of them you might get some short term nutrients in him but you'd hardly build a lasting habit. He'd simply never eat them when you weren't around, and possibly might avoid eating around you. Instead you'd talk to him about why is good to eat vegetables, and try to figure out how to cook them so he enjoys then.\n\nLikewise, teaching kids about money should be about education, not something you impose on him when he's come into some money. Show him your budget. Talk about what you do with windfalls when they happen to you. Let him take initiative to handle his money responsibly (while keeping in mind he has time). If you convince him it's a worthwhile thing to do, you'll have better long term results.", "NTA\n\nIn fact I often see it suggested that when you get your first paypacket to blow the lot and then  start your savings plan from the second one.\n\nJack has just done this from a younger age than some people.\n\nI can see where his mom is coming from though but she's not necessarily right.\n\nI would probably sit down with Jack and teach him about money and budgeting.  This is not a single lesson but one learnt over time because he's learning a lot by watching what you do.\n\nPerhaps encourage him to save 50-70% of his earnings and he can't spend the rest on whatever he likes.  He can save up for something bigger with that 25% he has to spend.  Or spend the lot when he gets paid.\n\nThis will be more relevant once he gets a part time job rather than one offs like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A third to savings, a third to non negociables that may come up during the month and a third for whatever he wants but it has to last the month.

When he gets a part time job at 16 and makes more money, we'll rearrange his savings and stuff, but it will always be his choice.

With the average game costing $59.99-$69.99, $500 is only going to get you about 5 games.

The circumstances with the mother are not clear from your comments, but to me, it's very reasonable for them to expect to have some involvement in big decisions like this. It's making life needlessly more difficult for your former partner if you choose to raise your child without consultation on big decisions. \n\nIt's already likely a painful situation for them, without feeling shut out like this.

Why should he have to have access to only half of it?\n\nA parent's job is to prepare kids for being adults, and getting access to only half the money is likely what his earning experience will be like for the rest of his life. \n\nIt's a good lesson that you shouldn't spend all your paycheck on frivolous things. He might not have bills and taxes to worry about yet but putting aside some of the money for college would teach him that when you get paid, you have to think about setting some aside for future expenses you know are coming.

I'd recommend anyone with kids doing this whether they make $300k or $30k.", "There is 5 years between his first paycheck at 13 and him turning 18, he has time to learn.\n\nAnd actually spending your own money can be helpful to understand money management.", "And he can save, from his future paychecks.", "Sure, and he has time to learn.

Not to mention that pushing the kid to save money if he doesn't want to is counterproductive.

We obviously disagree. Have a nice day.", "I think you explained it pretty well, the guy with the counter argument is not to bright.", "Yes!  If you're never allowed to spend (or waste, depending on how you look at it)  money as a kid, when you finally start earning money you tend to go wild with spending.", "If 13 is too young and 18 is too old, when should he learn?", "Or we just have different opinions. Calling someone stupid because of difference of opinions says more about your intelligence.", "I never said 18 is too old. But lets say 15, 16 is a good time. And in my experience kids learn when they start spending money on everyday things. A lot of time kids don't have an idea how much the cost of living is. \n\nAnyway, even 13 can be okay if the kid starts earning regularly. But he should be able to blow his first check on whatever he wants without having to worry about savings."]}
