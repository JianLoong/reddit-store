Before he was born, we toured a few daycares, but ultimately decided to try to get through the first year of our baby's life without childcare. We have flexible enough jobs that my husband could shift his work to 7:30am-3:30pm and I can work 3:30pm-6:30pm. I agreed to try to create a schedule where the baby is napping at 3:30 to ensure a smoother transition. This later became a request from my husband that he nap from 3:30 to 4pm so that he would have an opportunity to decompress. I have struggled to ensure this 100% of the time. In addition, the baby recently has been very cranky when he does wake up and my husband is finding him hard to console.\n\n Previously, the baby had a blowout during my husband's time and he noted that the diaper seemed loose. I made it a point to give him a tight diaper after that. Today, he had another blowout with my husband and he said the diaper seemed loose again. He showed that he typically puts it on much tighter and I acknowledged that I do not typically make it that tight and that I would in the future make it even tighter. He proceeded to tell me that he feels I am doing things that sabotage his time and leave him with an inconsolable baby. \n\nI swore (and do believe) that I am working very hard to set him up for success (arranging his naps and feedings, holding him for naps earlier in the day to prevent him from being overtired, getting bottles and other supplies ready) but he does not believe me because I did not make the diaper tight enough.  \n\nI do not want to quit my job, but did bring up the option today. He told me that I should not and that he would expect me to continue to pay the bills if I did. But he also said the baby needs to be with me and that I there is an obvious answer. I keep trying to set realistic expectations with him about his time with the baby, but he feels there is more I can do to create a better experience.

He acts as though you are sabotaging him. This child is his too, and he needs to step up and take care of him. Babies have leaky diapers, don't always sleep when you want them to, and aren't always easy. They are tiny humans, not robots. I am sorry but your husband has no respect for you.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like he only wants to be a dad when the baby is sleeping or happy. That's unrealistic. \n\nBabies cry for all types of reasons. My sister has a baby, and she cries when you turn Elmo off. But my brother in law doesn't get all pissy when she does that. He tries to soothe her and accepts that this is what babies do.\n\nIf your husband thinks a diaper is too loose, he can change it. If he thinks the baby is tired, he can try to get him to sleep. And if he doesn't sleep and if your can't get him to stop crying, your husband can accept that this is what babies do. That is called being a dad.\n\nAnd don't quit your job. He seems to be assuming thay as the mother, the baby is more your area of expertise. The baby \"needs to be with you\" and \"you can do more ti control your son's moods.\" Tell him either he can quit his job and be a stay-at-home dad, thus eliminating the transition stress; the two of you can use daycare; or he can take some parenting classes and grow the fuck up.", "NTA  First of all, you can only make a diaper so tight.  You do not want to make it uncomfortable for the infant.  Second, all babies have blowouts, no matter what you do.  Your husband has unrealistic expectations on what you are able to do.  What is important is to provide the infant with the best possible care that you BOTH can provide.  This is a team effort  as the child is as much his as yours.  Your hubby needs to man up and just deal with whatever comes.  Babies get fussy, they get sick, they teeth, and the adults need to do what ever is best for the baby.  Your husband is the AH and childish to boot.  You have done all you can, he just needs to get a realistic idea of what parenting an infant is all about.", "NTA\n\nYou're as much the mother as he is the father of this baby. He's as capable as you are. He can handle a blowout without blaming you, and it won't be his last. Blowouts are one of those things that can happen even if the diaper is okay. Does the baby have blowouts with you ?\n\nIf you were to quit your job, you'd be a SAHM. How and why should you pay the bills ? This is not realistic.\n\nIn any case, your husband can also find solutions to make things work. You seem to be doing your best and when things go wrong on his side, it's not your fault. He's entirely responsible for his child when you're at work. I feel like everything rests on your shoulders but you're a team.\n\nEdit : your title should be \"AITA for leaving my son with his dad while I'm at work ?\"", "NTA. Your husband is a d***.\n\nYour a mum. You do not have a secret solution to making your baby happy. Your baby is new in this world and learning about that crying gets attention etc. There is no magic switch to make him sleep.\n\nYour husband is expecting too much from you to have a solution for everything.\n\nI hated reading that he said the solution was for you to be with the baby, yet if you stop work you are expected to still pay your share of the bills?", "NTA \n\nYour husband is being such an ass here. Your solo parenting time is twice as long as your husband\u2019s and yet he expects you to do all the work for his time too, it sounds like he has this unrealistic idea that he doesn\u2019t have to actively parent during his time. Your son should not have to be in a constant state of discomfort from a too tight diaper because your husband is being a giant baby about a little bit of poop. The comment about you still paying bills if you care for your son full time really rubs me the wrong way too. Overall your husband just doesn\u2019t seem like he views this as an actual partnership and I\u2019m really sorry you are finding this put now when there\u2019s already a child in your life. You deserve much better than you are getting from your husband and I hope the responses here will help you feel empowered to stand up for yourself.", "NTA. You don't need anyone to make the baby's diaper extra tight for you. There are also simply times that a baby is extra fussy. He's a parent, he can cope.\n\nBut he is extra the A.H. for saying that you are both responsible for the baby (including during his time) and for paying the bills. You have more than one fussy person at home.", "NTA. I am not a parent, but I worked in the infant room at a daycare for several years. You're actually right not to make the diaper too tight...it'll be uncomfy for the lil' nugget and cause a red line on his waist. \n\nI'm really sick of so many men not wanting to put in 50% of the work for the baby. I've cleaned up countless blowouts, it's really nothing to whine about, they are not that bad. I know he works longer hours than you, but you are just as tired and stressed as he is, AND probably still doing the post-partum thing. So no, to be blunt - he needs to suck it up a little bit!", "You care for your baby all day and then go to work with no break or downtime and he's complaining he has to take on the same amount of work because why? If only we could make children extremely predictable and sit quietly while we care for ourselves- it's why parents get burned out. You aren't responsible for making your child content during dad's time and he needs to reevaluate the expectation. If he isn't managing then he should accept outside help (daycare). I have 2 in diapers and I havent figured out any magic trick to stopping blowouts. 1000% NTA\n\nAlso want to add 4 month olds have sleep regressions and sleep patterns go absolutely haywire, once again, not your fault!", "NTA. He can find a way to settle the baby while you work. Your job is part time, and you're entitled your work time, just as he is. You're being accommodating and trying to find solutions.\n\nHe needs to realize that the baby is a living human who is still adjusting to being alive. There will be changes and he needs to be able to be flexible, rather than stressing you out, or crying sabotage.", "NTA because it's his child as much as yours. When you have a baby they are going to be fussy, have blowouts, disrupt schedules, etc. It sounds like you are bending over backward to accommodate him and his time but does he even care about your time and your needs? Would he be posting this with concern about him leaving you with a fussy baby?\n\nIt is unrealistic for him to assume when he is home watching the baby that he isn't going to have to put in the hard work that comes with raising a living being just because he's had a long day at work while he expects you to work as well and won't look at alternative childcare solutions.", "NTA.  Your husband is whack.  It's a baby, not a robot that you can program.  Jesus, can't wait to see how he handles teething.  PS - what is the obvious answer?  Because it seems like he's the one setting you up to fail.", "NTA - tell your husband to man up and take care of his kid like a parent is supposed to. You\u2019re literally taking care of the kid all day long. He has three hours. He can suck it up.", "NTA  the obvious solution is your husband can just replace the diaper when he takes over and do it the way he wants. He'll just have to deal with it otherwise.How does he expect you to work, be with the baby, be a SAHM, pay your own bills, not have outside help and anticipate how he wants things done? You need to stop letting him calling the shots and working to make it easier for him - he's certainly not doing that for you.", "There\u2019d be a bit of E S H if you were both adamant about avoiding daycare, because that\u2019s the obvious answer\u2026but it seems that\u2019s all coming from him. His expectations are ridiculous. You can\u2019t control a four month old\u2019s nap timing that much, and trying to do so is likely making the baby much fussier. Blowouts happen\u2026or maybe it\u2019s from making the damn diapers too tight. Your husband is acting like a controlling, selfish ass.\n\nWhat does he do to make your time with the baby as easy as possible, btw?\n\nAnd who is taking care of the baby at night? I have a wild guess on that one\u2026", "When do you get time alone to decompress?  You are definitely NTA", "NTA. Your husband is being extremely unreasonable:\nHe says the baby needs to be with you but\n-He doesn't want you to quit your job\n-He doesn't want to put the baby on daycare and\n-He doesn't want outside help either\nThe only way you can accomplish that is if you somehow found a way to duplicate yourself \nBaby are human beings they are not machines that you program, yeah you can develop a routine but the baby ain't going to stick to it to a 100%. You are not sabotaging him he is sabotaging himself for having unrealistic expectations, he wants to come home to an sleeping baby who wakes up with out making a fuss and is calm and happy while he cares for the baby. I'm guessing your husband gets irritated when this expectations aren't meet, an irritated person is going to upset the baby, which would upset your husband which would upset the baby more, and the cicle never ends. I'm going to cut him some slack and say he's just a little bit an AH since you have a newborn, you both work, I'm sure you're both tired and sleep deprived but you can keep going like this, I'm not sure what he means by \"no outside help\" but if you can get that someone you trust cares for your baby for a few hours, while both of you rest and decompress, and talk he might understand that you can't program your baby to be all smiles and giggles when is dad's turn to watch him", "More you can do to create a \u201cbetter experience\u201d \u2026 for him \u2026 around infant care?\n\nNTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a baby. They need things all the time. Not complicated things, but all the time. Hold the baby, feed the baby, clean the baby. Repeat until they hit a new developmental stage. There is nothing here that is about making his experience comfy? He needs to parent. Hold the baby, feed the baby, clean the baby. \n\nThat\u2019s the job. \n\nIf the diapers you have the baby in need to be wrapped down super tight to prevent blow outs, you may need a brand that fits differently. (Or if you\u2019re using cloth diapers, a different fold/cover/thing. We ended up with a twist thing that fit our baby best?) \n\nAnd he\u2019d want you to pay the same bills with no income? Is he an unreasonable asshole all of the time or just half? Because he sounds awful to live with.", "NTA. If you were pinching the baby to make it cry right before handing it over to dad, then yeah you'd be TA. Otherwise you're just doing more than your fair share of parenting and getting the blame for your baby being a baby. \n\nYour child won't be 4 months old forever, I hope your husband grows up in the meantime too.", "NTA It sounds like your husband is tired and stressed and overwhelmed and he\u2019s taking that all out on you, who is ALSO tired and stressed and overwhelmed. And you have likely more reason to be as the person who literally birthed the baby. You are working hard to tackle such a hard time in a child\u2019s and parent\u2019s life, and if he isn\u2019t supporting you and you aren\u2019t a team, he\u2019s being the Ahole. There\u2019s a phrase: it\u2019s not you and me vs each other, it\u2019s you and me vs the problem. He\u2019s putting you guys against each other and not looking for solutions. If he forgets to do something small like take out the trash do you say he\u2019s sabotaging your efforts to keep a clean home? No. You forgot to make a tighter diaper, it happens, force of habit to do it as you usually would with a squirming baby, and he says something resentful and cruel. He isn\u2019t looking for solutions which could be a nanny or housekeeper or someone to help you guys. You\u2019re doing amazing and he needs to be solution focused! Not problem focused!", "Nta  if he didn't want to deal.wirh a fussy baby he should t be. A dad", "NTA.

Shit happens, and a blowout shouldn't ruin his whole time.", "NAH:  please seek both couples and individual counseling. Postpartum is awful for everyone.

But I think I threw that shirt away afterwards.\n\nTL/DR: Your husband has a classic case of \"Wants to be a Dad, until it's time to do Dad stuff.\" Any adult should be able to deal with even a sick colicy baby.  \"Create a better experience?\" \"Sabotaging his time?\" No daycare until a year old?

Somebody called me on it, and I said \"But how can I learn to be a good Dad some day?\"\n\nMy Mom's BFF (a nurse) had a surprise baby when I was a young teenager. Of course I helped take care of him.  She taught me the trick of locking my thumb over a baby's hipbone when holding them, in case the baby suddenly decides they want to be somewhere else.  That saved my newborn daughter from a four-foot fall headfirst onto the concrete hospital floor."]}
