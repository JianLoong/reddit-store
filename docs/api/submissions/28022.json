She does not drive. Its too much work and makes her anxious. It used to be fine since she usually work from home and goes out only once every couple of weeks for grocery shopping or for client meetings.\n\nBut since her husband left, she has been calling me to go hang out with her.

She wants me to take her baby shopping, furniture shopping, help remodel her home, bring her out whenever she has cravings, rub her foot, help her with chores when she is too tired etc. I don't want to. \n\nFirst of all : Shopping has never been my thing. Walking for hours looking at different things is just exhausting to me. I am a internet buyer.I told her that she can maybe ask one of her friends. But since she basically was burrowed at home for the past 4 years, she is not in touch with her friends. Our parents live 3 hour away. \n\nI told her she can wait and take mom with her then. She wants me to drive mom here since mom refuses to take public transport or drive here. Dad does not want to drive her here in his off days. \n\nI said its same for me. I dont want to spend my off days driving them around either. (Mom would not stay here since she has work back home). \n\nI am already the one taking my sister to her appointments.
