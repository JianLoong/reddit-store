I'd recommend suggesting to your sister that she sign up some prenatal fitness/yoga classes and try to build some community for herself with people who are at a similar life stage as her. They can likely reccomend resources and local sources of support. Also maybe she'd benefit from some driving lessons to enable herself to be more independent. Being pregnant is really difficult for many people, so while you need to set your boundaries remember to also be nice to her and consider that her need for support is very normal.", "Help with baby shopping, yeah you should. Minor renovations for the baby yeah you should. Step in as a surrogate partner and help with cravings and massage h.e done hockey sticks no. You're not a romantic partner. Sorry she's in the situations but that's part of the sacrifice made by partners/SOs of military. \n\nNTA you are doing more than your part.", "NTA\nHelp from your loved ones is offered/asked for, not demanded.

What about his family, are they close by and able to help, because this baby is their family too.", "NTA.  The help I'd offer is paying for her to take driver's Ed.

Up until then I lived mostly on military bases that had everything within biking distance and I was more of a stay at home person. Driving makes me insanely nervous, to the point I have had to pull over and have a cry or puke.\n\nI feel sorry for her because I know how stressful driving can be, but she's going to have to learn to drive. There are going to be times she's going to have an appointment or emergency and no one is going to be available.

She can take an Uber to the store and have things delivered.", "NTA. As someone pointed out upthread, your sister seems to make no connections between choices and consequences. Possibly this in itself is a consequence of your parents guilting other people (you) into covering her for the consequences of her choices? She seems very entitled. Instead of her moving closer to her parents, which would make a lot more sense, she wants you to move in with her and basically become her... husband? Driving her around, remodeling her home, doing her chores, even rubbing her feet? That is ridiculous. \n\nI think you are already doing plenty for her. If you do any more, it will just delay her making choices that fit her situation. You will get more and more sucked in to being her handmaid.

How is she planning to take her child to dr appointments, school etc if her husband is not around all the time??

Does husband intend to leave merchant marines or stay for another 10 or 15 years or so?\n\nWhatever OP says yes to now, Mom and Sis will continue to demand forever. \n\nObvious answer is for Sis to move within a few blocks of her parents if she will never drive and Mom will never drive again. Mom refusing to drive seems strange since she can't be that old.

Don't let them bully you into being a surrogate partner for your sister, who needs to grow up and learn to be the (mostly) single parent she signed up to be when she married someone who would be away most of the time.

She is selfish thinking that everyone should be at her beck and call.  She can take public transportation or order stuff and have it delivered.

And as far as family helps family & it takes a village, why aren't they stepping up? Why arent they teaching her to drive, to help herself? Its not on everyone else to give up their lives so she can live hers. She expects you to do uncomfortable things for her benefit when she isnt even willing to do them. And your mom is capable of staying,  driving & taking public, she just doesn't want to. So much easier to guilt trip you to do it. Some villiage. Some family.", "NTA - And I am really tired of people demanding time from childfree people. It sounds terrible to say, but you didn't agree to be a part of this village and you certainly didn\u2019t sign up to take on the role of her husband.

It is helpful in raising children to be well-adjusted, confident, and self-sufficient for them to have other positive influences in their lives in addition to parents and siblings. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, family friends can all provide a more well-rounded experience to the upbringing of children -- in addition to being there for emergency childcare (and possibly regular childcare, if they are willing), and possibly running errands and giving financial support.\n\nBut the thing about \"The Village\" is that it consists of people who have *volunteered* to be part of the village. It's an opt-in role -- a mother-to-be does **not** get to conscript an unwilling person into her village.\n\nBut this saying is often used by people who have children for whom they're not able to provide, to try to guilt-trip other people into taking on responsibilities that are not theirs to bear -- just as OP's sister is doing.", "I think this is exactly what OP is being set up to do.
