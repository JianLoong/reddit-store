I met one of my cousin's kids for the first time. The young woman had just had her third kid and had been left by her boyfriend. He was the father of only the latest kid. \n\nShe looked so worn down and sad. When I got back home I spoke with my wife and she agreed that if his family was okay with it we would adopt her youngest kid. It was an offer, not a demand. And we made sure to explain that we would help her out monetarily with the other two as well. \n\nI was adopted in a similar manner so I have always felt a desire to pay it forward. My adoptive parents are also related to my biological parents and they helped them with money too.  \n\nWell it became a huge deal. I was trying to steal a kid just because I had money and blah blah blah.  \n\nSo I said no problem and walked away from the offer. \n\nWell that baby is 13 now and his mother has had two more kids. She is being supported by her mom but not doing great. Her two eldest kids are working and going to school but the 13 year old is a bit of a jerk I guess. Skipping school and hanging out with the wrong people.  \n\nMy family contacted me to see if I were still willing to help him out by bringing him up here. I passed. There is a big difference between a baby and a 13 year old trouble maker.  Plus I'm 50 now and I don't really have the energy to deal with that shit.  \n\nSo I declined. \n\nMy family down there are shitting on me for going back on my offer. So I offered to pay all of his expenses down there if any of them would take him in. Nobody thought that was a good deal. \n\nI feel bad for the kid. I have a fairly good idea how his life is going to go. I just don't think that I'm the person to fix this problem.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685284826, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13u21hz/aita_for_going_back_on_an_offer_to_adopt_my_cousin/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NtA. \n\nNo offer lasts 13 year. And adopting a baby is very different compared to adopting a teen. Even a well behaved teen.", "NTA. That offer was 13 years ago and was declined by them. You didn't go back on any offer. There is a huge difference between a baby and a teenager.", "You didn\u2019t go back on your offer.  They **rejected your offer.** That was the end of the offer, by their choice.\n\nOffering to pay expenses is far more that most people would do in this situation.\n\nNTA", "NTA \u2014 no rational person would expect that offer to still stand 13 years later. And the fact that none of them are willing to help out even if you cover all their expenses tells you everything you need to know!", "NTA.", "NTA.  There is nothing wrong with logic.  Tell them life is about choices and it is not your fault they keep making the wrong ones; they had their chance.", "NTA. What \u201coffer\u201d did you go back on? You offered, they rejected it. \n\nWhat happened is they made a new offer and you are not interested in it. Funny how it\u2019s ok for them, but not you, isn\u2019t it?", "NTA.\nYou were generous enough to make the offer and they refused it and made it an issue. Now that they can't handle the child, they are trying to dump the whole problem on you. The cousin herself is the reason for the situation she is in now.", "Nta. You made a generous offer to adopt a baby.  Your offer was rejected.  You owe the nothing.  Move on.", "NTA - They declined your offer the first time, but now that he's a problem, they wanna see if the offer still stands? No. No rational person would accept this. You're already being very generous, offering to help cover expenses, as long as one of them takes him in, but none of them are willing to do that. That's a huge sign, I feel bad for the kid, but this isn't your responsibility.", "NTA. Adopting a baby to raise in your family is far more different than being the financial benefactor of a teenage trouble maker. What are they thinking that because they declined and you missed out on first steps and words, you\u2019d really be ok with other firsts like, first arrest, first fingerprints and first mug shots? Naw. Hard pass.", "If an employer offered them a job ad they turned it down, do they think that 10 years later the job is still sitting open waiting for them? Of course not.   A proposal was made and declined.  That opening was closed.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou made an offer to adopt a baby and at that time the family scoffed and threw a fit.  At that point and time the offer made had been rejected by your \"family\" end of story.\n\nNow that the child is a troublemaker, your \"family\" is simply looking to dump the on you, and are simply making trouble/a big deal about the original offer, because they now want something.\n\nDon't fall for it, actually don't even give it a second thought, because they are the ones who rejected a very generous offer, and a potential chance to change that childs and even their siblings future, now it's time for them to figure out how to deal with the situation they themselves have brought on to themselves and the kids.\n\nWhen it comes to the latest offer you have made, I'd go ahead and let them know that since it was not good enough for them, that you have decided to revoke/cancel it, and then simply move on with your life.\n\nYes, this is probably going to suck for the kid, and chances are right that his life is going to be a challenge, but what would your \"family\" have done if you were not an option?  They would have figured things out, because that's all anyone can do.\n\nIt's not your job to clean up behind others, it's one thing to raise a child from the start (infant to toddler), it's totally another thing to bring a teenager and especially a trouble maker into your family because he's become too much trouble for his mother and extended family.\n\nI think I'd just tell everyone is SA that I love them, but I don't have any time, energy or resources to spend/use towards cleaning/fixing the issues that are the result of their choices and actions over the years.  I'd probably admit and acknowledge that I feel bad for the kid, but how I feel about the kids future outlook still doesn't make it my problem, because I'm not the parent.\n\nI hope this made sense and was helpful.\n\nBest wishes and good hope to you, your immediate family, your extended family, and the kid going forward.  I know that this sucks and it's stressful, but saying \"no\" is pretty much the only thing you can do, without risking your future.\n\nBe strong, be safe and be well!", "Against the grain and sure to be unpopular, but ESH. \n\nI understand that your intentions were good, but it must have been a really big shock to your cousin when you (a perfect stranger to her, if I'm understanding your post correctly) asked if she would want to give up her *baby* to you. I mean, that would be a shock to *anyone* who just had a baby if they weren't even considering adoption in the first place. So, yeah, even though your cousin seemed \"tired and sad,\" it was an AH move to approach her about giving up her baby to you as a way for you to pay your own adoption forward. Sorry, but being surprised by your cousin's reaction to such a *huge, life-altering* request like that is a bit naive, at best. I think that kind of proposal would offend *a lot* of people.\n\nBut your family *also* sucks for contacting you *13 years later* and asking if you still wanted to adopt your cousin's child, simply because he is now getting into some trouble.\n\nEveryone in this story treats this kid like he's an object in a transaction that can be bartered and traded for. AHs all around, except for the kid, of course.", "NTA\n\nThe same family that criticized you of trying to \u201csteal\u201d a baby is now asking you to take him in? No. Had you brought him up, he\u2019d have had your family values imprinted on him, as well as the stable environment you offered. He _might_ not be having the same behavioral issues. Instead, he grew up with a single mother who was already \u201cworn down and sad\u201d who added two more kids to the mix. You owe them nothing. You owe _him_ nothing (especially she had 2 other kids who may go the way he is. Would you expect the same for them?) You\u2019re not a social services agency. They made their bed, so\u2026", "NTA.

What sort of a reaction should people have when a perfect stranger approaches them and asks if they would give their baby up to them? I truly don't get why people think the mother should have just handed her newborn over to someone she had only just met (or *anyone,* for that matter) simply because they asked her if she would be willing to do that. Asking a mother if she would allow you to adopt her baby *that is not up for adoption* is just absurd.", "> *\"You offered to adopt a baby.\"*\n\nYeah, a baby that the *mother had no intention of putting up for adoption.* I seem to be the only one who thinks such an \"offer\" is just absurd. Would you really expect someone to give up their baby to a perfect stranger (or anyone, for that matter) just because they asked? What kind of a reaction would you honestly expect someone to have to being approached with such an offer? \n\nI think a lot of people would have a problem with a request like that.", "Certainly it was the mother's right to refuse the initial offer of adoption. That was never in question. The part that makes OP's family the AHs is berating OP for not wanting to adopt the child now, 13 YEARS after rejecting the initial offer to adopt. And on TOP of that, really truly cementing the AH status, is that no other family member would take in the child even when OP offered to cover all of the child's expenses! That really tells you that they're just trying to pawn the little guy off, poor thing. I feel so bad for him.\n\n\n( NTA )", "I get what you mean but I think OP meant they met the cousin's kid for the first time and not the cousin herself. From what I gathered, I think OP understood that the person might not be able to take good care of the kid so they offered to adopt and give the kid a better life.
