They would have figured things out, because that's all anyone can do.\n\nIt's not your job to clean up behind others, it's one thing to raise a child from the start (infant to toddler), it's totally another thing to bring a teenager and especially a trouble maker into your family because he's become too much trouble for his mother and extended family.\n\nI think I'd just tell everyone is SA that I love them, but I don't have any time, energy or resources to spend/use towards cleaning/fixing the issues that are the result of their choices and actions over the years.

I'm from Central America and the adoption from a relative who lives in North America, Australia, or Europe is pretty common. Specially when the young mother keeps giving birth from different men.

If, while I was struggling at all, I\u2019d had a family member come to me and say \u201chey, what if I adopt them for you so they can have a better life?\u201d, I would have been crushed.

Plenty of middle class and wealth parents end up with troubled teenagers, but we don\u2019t look back and say they shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to have them in the first place. If we think it\u2019s acceptable for anyone to say at birth \u201cI think based on your profile/characteristics that you\u2019re going to fail as a parent so I think it would be better to preemptively remove your child, even though that isn\u2019t what you want\u201d, that\u2019s a pretty bleak outlook that gets into all sorts of terrible territory with class, race, disability, etc.\n\nOP could have gently reached out to the family to enquire whether adoption was something the mother wanted at all.

Because that\u2019s not the case here. \n\nOP is the one who wanted to adopt a baby from a mother who had not indicated at all that she was looking for someone to adopt her baby.

Was OP planning on only keeping the baby while it was young, cute, and easy to take care of? They should only have made the offer to adopt if they were planning on being there through thick and thin, for the long haul. While I agree 13 years is a long time and things change, it seems like OP did not give it enough thought at the time. And of course it is offensive to ask someone to give you their baby. Why not offer to help the mother instead so she could keep the baby within the family?", "I agree COMPLETELY.
