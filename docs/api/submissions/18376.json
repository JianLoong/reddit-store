My adoptive parents are also related to my biological parents and they helped them with money too.  \n\nWell it became a huge deal. I was trying to steal a kid just because I had money and blah blah blah.  \n\nSo I said no problem and walked away from the offer. \n\nWell that baby is 13 now and his mother has had two more kids. She is being supported by her mom but not doing great. Her two eldest kids are working and going to school but the 13 year old is a bit of a jerk I guess. Skipping school and hanging out with the wrong people.  \n\nMy family contacted me to see if I were still willing to help him out by bringing him up here. I passed. There is a big difference between a baby and a 13 year old trouble maker.  Plus I'm 50 now and I don't really have the energy to deal with that shit.  \n\nSo I declined. \n\nMy family down there are shitting on me for going back on my offer. So I offered to pay all of his expenses down there if any of them would take him in. Nobody thought that was a good deal. \n\nI feel bad for the kid.

They would have figured things out, because that's all anyone can do.\n\nIt's not your job to clean up behind others, it's one thing to raise a child from the start (infant to toddler), it's totally another thing to bring a teenager and especially a trouble maker into your family because he's become too much trouble for his mother and extended family.\n\nI think I'd just tell everyone is SA that I love them, but I don't have any time, energy or resources to spend/use towards cleaning/fixing the issues that are the result of their choices and actions over the years.

I'm from Central America and the adoption from a relative who lives in North America, Australia, or Europe is pretty common. Specially when the young mother keeps giving birth from different men.

It\u2019s great that you wanted to help your family. But you could have reached out to mutual family members, for example, and asked if adoption was something your cousin would even be interested in, before assuming and making the offer.\n\nThe perspective I\u2019m coming from is that the first year of a baby\u2019s life is often really, really hard. If, while I was struggling at all, I\u2019d had a family member come to me and say \u201chey, what if I adopt them for you so they can have a better life?\u201d, I would have been crushed.

Plenty of middle class and wealth parents end up with troubled teenagers, but we don\u2019t look back and say they shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to have them in the first place. If we think it\u2019s acceptable for anyone to say at birth \u201cI think based on your profile/characteristics that you\u2019re going to fail as a parent so I think it would be better to preemptively remove your child, even though that isn\u2019t what you want\u201d, that\u2019s a pretty bleak outlook that gets into all sorts of terrible territory with class, race, disability, etc.\n\nOP could have gently reached out to the family to enquire whether adoption was something the mother wanted at all.

Because that\u2019s not the case here. \n\nOP is the one who wanted to adopt a baby from a mother who had not indicated at all that she was looking for someone to adopt her baby.

You thought she was having a hard time, wanted to help lighten her load as a single parent by offering to take on her youngest kid, she declined, you said 'okay, fair enough', backed off.\n\nThe offer was removed from the table when they said no. \n\nThey can't seriously expect you to follow through 13 years later because they've decided the kid is a pain actually and they regret saying no. You can't take back your choices just because you regret how things are now.", "NTA. After thirteen years, the offer is null and void. Period.", "NTA - they refused the offer. When you refuse an offer, it\u2019s no longer an offer. You can\u2019t go back on an offer when they were the ones who refused it. They are now making YOU an offer, take our 13 year old trouble maker, and you responded with no, because you\u2019re not up for the challenge anymore.

There is a large difference between a baby and a teen. I'm only in my late 20's but I was in a similar situation. I offered to adopt one of my baby siblings if it ever became necessary (a younger brother was adopted by an uncle so it seemed likely the next child might need to be taken away from our parent as well). After an incident last year it came up again. I was actually more stable financially/housing wise 5 years ago despite my age, so it wasn't going to be a possibility now. Thankfully, no one took it that seriously, it was only mentioned. I hope you don't judge yourself sharply, you did what you could and you don't have to change your life now to try to help someone who refused so late now.

Your nephew\u2019s mother chose to have more kids, right? Thirteen years ago she accused you of trying to steal her baby. You declined the offer to adopt the baby thirteen years ago after all the negative accusations. You are not responsible for financially supporting nor adopting anyone.

I've also seen it a lot in Australian Indigenous families, if a young teen gets pregnant then the baby will go to someone else in the family who already has kids. In some Asian cultures it's normal for a couple to send their children back to their own parents in the home country, so that they can keep working and sending money back.\n\n  \n\n\nJust because it doesn't happen in your culture doesn't mean it's rude.", "True dat - I would be heartbroken if my parents gave me up at that critical year for being \u201cdifficult\u201d (which I was)", "Even within general culture frames, there are ways to do things inappropriately.

There is a huge difference between adopting a baby and adopting a 13 yr old, you\u2019re right. I can\u2019t fault you for knowing where you are in life and what you\u2019re up for.

It would have been different if had adopted the kid when he was a baby.  But, to adopt a child who does not know you at all would be a disaster.

It's a bit overexaggerated but you get the point.", "NTA it\u2019s a totally different situation to adopt a young baby - a 13-year-old would be dealing with massive feelings of abandonment and failure, and ripping him from what he knows is cruel at that point.", "NTA, you offered to adopt him and were refused, they can\u2019t just change their minds over a decade later!", "NTA, you offered to help. They rebuffed it and then come back later on screaming at you for not helping. It's their own mess they have to deal with it. The fact none of them are willing to take him in makes me think there is more to the kid then they want to let on.", "NTA\nA baby is a gamble but taking on a known Troublemaker?", "NTA - the offer was made 13 yrs ago.

You got crap for wanting to adopt the baby. You backed off. You did the right thing.\n\nShe should have taken you up on the offer!", "ESH", "NTA\nBaffling. Families are literally insane. \n\nWhen you apply for car loans at multiple banks, you reject all but one offer. You can\u2019t go back later and say \u201cthe last one didn\u2019t work out, can I have that loan now?\u201d No. The offer expired. \n\nThe mother has the right to deny adoption, she\u2019s not the AH for that. It\u2019s that now that it\u2019s inconvenient for her, since she decided to have even more kids, she (or the family) expects you to take the load off her. I love that you offered them and they also denied (not for the child\u2019s sake, but just as a taste of their own medicine)\n\nAt 13 this kid is pretty set in his ways, he\u2019s gunna be a 13 y/o stallion - almost impossible to break.

What do they mean you're going back on your offer? They went back on said offer when they accused you of trying to steak him! And to top it off, that was 13 years ago! Are they nuts? Yeah, they're nuts and don't listen to a word they say. Adopting a baby when you're 37 is world's away from taking on a volatile 13 year old at 50! Not to mention that this is not your child. He could've been, but they didn't want that so ask everyone who has something negative to say why aren't they taking him in? Yeah, I thought so. I hope he figures it out before he gets himself into something he can't get out of, but that's not your problem. You tried to help 13 years ago and your help wasn't wanted so this is not your fault.

I\u2019m pretty sure the offer expired sometime between when this kid was a baby and when he grew into a literal teenager.", "Yeah.  Asking to give someone money in exchange for their child is usually seen as pretty shady.  But when you call it adoption, suddenly that makes it ok?  \n\nI know that the competition to get an infant for adoption is fierce, with more people wanting to adopt than there are babies available for adoption.  People will drop tens of thousands of dollars and do unethical things just to get a baby.  I'm wondering if OP was just trying to avoid the wait lists, etc. involved with adopting through other channels and saw an opportunity to get a baby?\n\nIt's pretty messed up to see someone struggling with childcare and the way OP decides to help them is to buy their child.  OP should really read up on adoptive parent saviorism.  Although now that the child is not a baby anymore they're worthless, apparently.  Just like how people treat the older kids in US foster care.  They don't want them.  \n\nOP is saying they're too tired for the drama of the 13 yr old.  Well, OP would be the same age now if they adopted the kid.  They are assuming if they raised the kid it wouldn't be getting into trouble, but we don't know that for sure.  How were they planning to have the energy to deal with a teen if they'd adopted the baby?  \n\nEverybody wants babies and seems to forget that they grow up.  Like people getting a puppy.  That's why people rehome kids they adopt.

And with the offer to pay money to help with the remaining kids\u2026 You realise you tried to buy a child, right, and that\u2019s not exactly a moral high ground??", "Some people realise raising kids in poverty is no good.", "I know it happens in other cultures. Regardless it's rude to ask postpartum mom if you can adopt her newborn son when she gave no indication she would want that. Op wasn't asked to adopt the baby, if I'm understanding it she didn't ask him for any help at all. Clearly mom and her family thought that Op was out of line given their original reaction. \n\nThose examples you gave are of people that wanted their child to be adopted and teenagers dependent on their parents are obviously in very different position that adult woman that's already raising 2 other children.", "We all know how strongly you feel because I've had to read the same comment from you like 15 times now. So many people have explained to you that this is normal in OP's culture and family, and that familial adoption is actually common in every country especially ones with strong anti-choice cultures. This isn't  some rich white American trying to buy a Chinese baby because they want a baby but American agencies don't think they're suitable adopters. You're reacting very emotionally to a situation that isn't being described in this post."]}
