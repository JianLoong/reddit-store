They would have figured things out, because that's all anyone can do.\n\nIt's not your job to clean up behind others, it's one thing to raise a child from the start (infant to toddler), it's totally another thing to bring a teenager and especially a trouble maker into your family because he's become too much trouble for his mother and extended family.\n\nI think I'd just tell everyone is SA that I love them, but I don't have any time, energy or resources to spend/use towards cleaning/fixing the issues that are the result of their choices and actions over the years.

I'm from Central America and the adoption from a relative who lives in North America, Australia, or Europe is pretty common. Specially when the young mother keeps giving birth from different men.

If, while I was struggling at all, I\u2019d had a family member come to me and say \u201chey, what if I adopt them for you so they can have a better life?\u201d, I would have been crushed.

Plenty of middle class and wealth parents end up with troubled teenagers, but we don\u2019t look back and say they shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to have them in the first place. If we think it\u2019s acceptable for anyone to say at birth \u201cI think based on your profile/characteristics that you\u2019re going to fail as a parent so I think it would be better to preemptively remove your child, even though that isn\u2019t what you want\u201d, that\u2019s a pretty bleak outlook that gets into all sorts of terrible territory with class, race, disability, etc.\n\nOP could have gently reached out to the family to enquire whether adoption was something the mother wanted at all.

Because that\u2019s not the case here. \n\nOP is the one who wanted to adopt a baby from a mother who had not indicated at all that she was looking for someone to adopt her baby.

You sound like the family he had that said he demanded the kid. Your loose interpretation of what he said is way out of whack.", "Not so long ago in most places (and I'm guessing more recently in OPs culture of origin), this type of 'adoption' was not uncommon.

That stood out to me too. If the offer had been accepted he\u2019d have a 13yo whose \u201cshit\u201d he\u2019d have to deal with at 50.
