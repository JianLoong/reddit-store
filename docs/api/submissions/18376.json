They would have figured things out, because that's all anyone can do.\n\nIt's not your job to clean up behind others, it's one thing to raise a child from the start (infant to toddler), it's totally another thing to bring a teenager and especially a trouble maker into your family because he's become too much trouble for his mother and extended family.\n\nI think I'd just tell everyone is SA that I love them, but I don't have any time, energy or resources to spend/use towards cleaning/fixing the issues that are the result of their choices and actions over the years.

I'm from Central America and the adoption from a relative who lives in North America, Australia, or Europe is pretty common. Specially when the young mother keeps giving birth from different men.

What OP *does* say is that the mother felt like OP was trying to steal her baby because they had more money. It sounds quite a lot like she was offended and hurt to me.", "So I completely understand what your intentions were - but good intentions don\u2019t mean you handled something well. It\u2019s great that you wanted to help your family. But you could have reached out to mutual family members, for example, and asked if adoption was something your cousin would even be interested in, before assuming and making the offer.\n\nThe perspective I\u2019m coming from is that the first year of a baby\u2019s life is often really, really hard. If, while I was struggling at all, I\u2019d had a family member come to me and say \u201chey, what if I adopt them for you so they can have a better life?\u201d, I would have been crushed.

Plenty of middle class and wealth parents end up with troubled teenagers, but we don\u2019t look back and say they shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to have them in the first place. If we think it\u2019s acceptable for anyone to say at birth \u201cI think based on your profile/characteristics that you\u2019re going to fail as a parent so I think it would be better to preemptively remove your child, even though that isn\u2019t what you want\u201d, that\u2019s a pretty bleak outlook that gets into all sorts of terrible territory with class, race, disability, etc.\n\nOP could have gently reached out to the family to enquire whether adoption was something the mother wanted at all.

Because that\u2019s not the case here. \n\nOP is the one who wanted to adopt a baby from a mother who had not indicated at all that she was looking for someone to adopt her baby. That\u2019s a key point that I think a lot of commenters here are missing.", "Right?? This whole thread is pretty bonkers. It is not in the least bit \u201cgenerous\u201d to approach a mother and ask her to give up her newborn baby to you, when she hasn\u2019t expressed any indication at all that she was even considering adoption. I mean, who in their right mind would actually do that?", "Op said they were adopted in this manor. I would think that the family would be aware that this would be an option.", "Yeah, I see that you responded to like five different people in addition to making your own comment about that. OP said they were adopted under similar circumstances, and at least one other commenter pointed out that just because it seems wild to you, doesn't mean it isn't a thing in other places you're not familiar with. Plus, it just isn't the issue here, so it doesn't impact my vote.", "Dude, there are a LOT of adoptions that happen within families because one part of the family is more capable of taking care of the child than the biological parents.
