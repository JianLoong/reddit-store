It\u2019s what our friendship group hinges on. We pick each other apart like crazy and it\u2019s funny to us all, we all giggle and hug about it after. Typically if a joke goes too far, it\u2019s immediately stopped and apologised for. I love these girls like family.\n\nIn the group, we\u2019re known for different things about our love / sex lives. For example, one friend is known for never dating, another for hooking up too much, etc.\n\nI'm known as the one with the bad taste. I like non conventionally attractive guys. I've never minded this. We all take jabs at each other and it's so light hearted that no one can really be upset about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, I've started to talk to another guy. He is 100% my type and my heart genuinely skips whenever I see him. I feel like I've scored a jackpot. We get along like crazy, he's so charismatic, funny, and I love spending time with him. I personally believe he's incredibly attractive in every way.\n\nThe chat asked to see him as we do when we mention new guys and I was hesitant. They were already mocking a tad 'Go on, show us your new 3/10'. But either way I did. They were laughing at every single thing about them. From his hair, to his clothes, to every detail about his face in specifics. They were pointing out every single 'flaw' he had and ripping him to shreds for them.\n\nThey were praising me while tearing him apart. Saying things like 'You're way too pretty to date a guy that looks like an insect' and 'He'd better at least be funny, because you'll have to close your eyes whenever he speaks'. And I was fuming. I really like this guy.\n\nI told them to stop it. That I don't care if they generally laugh at my taste, but that pulling apart the features of a specific guy like that was unfair. They told me to lighten up, and that they were saying that because they believe I'm way out of his league and am selling myself short.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI left the chat after days of them sending the same two photos and laughing at him. He was the main topic. I got a message from one of my friends basically telling me to lighten up and that she didn't get why I was so upset about it, when it had been a running joke in our chat for years.\n\nI told her why I felt the way I did, about how I disliked they were hating someone I was so interested in because they don't consider him attractive. She told me they were doing it because they didn't want to see me 'waste myself' and that I should go for someone more attractive. She said they were sorry I took offence, but I should come back to the chat because we all take digs at each other. I told her we never take personal digs, and instead laugh at each other generally. Her response was a shrug emoji and a laughing emoji.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI blocked her after this and have been actively ignoring the others' attempts to contact me. I've vowed not to message them again until I get an actual apology.\n\nAt the same time I feel like I'm maybe being too harsh. They're right in saying I played into this joke for years, but never with a specific real life person.\n\nAITA?\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n*Edit:\n\nThank you for all the replies! I really appreciate the viewpoint and you\u2019re all probably right that I\u2019ve potentially just outgrown this \u2018humour\u2019 that we head.\n\nFor the people saying we\u2019re mean girls, I completely understand if that\u2019s your viewpoint. I will say though we have NEVER made fun of others (bar the occasional celebrity) outside of this situation. We keep our mockery to each other, or we keep is very light. For example: the girl who hooks up a lot. We don\u2019t ever comment on the PEOPLE she hooks with, we comment on her doing it. She\u2019s one of the friends in the groupchat and she joins in calling herself things too. We never ever make comments about people outside the chat (until this point) and I (personally at least), never seriously meant any of the things we said to one another and always took it as lame teenage joking.\n\n Same has always applied to my situation. Typically they make fun of my GENERAL type, short guys with no muscle who are very anti social usually. Or they\u2019ll laugh at my celebrity crushes. This is the first time it\u2019s ever been an actual person that\u2019s been made fun of outside of ourselves, so perhaps that\u2019s why I feel so hard done by.\n\nPeople have also commented that the other girls may also have felt how I\u2019m feeling and just didn\u2019t say anything. I agree, that very well could be the case. I suppose I never really thought about how this line of joking could be so harmful and toxic because it never was to me until this point.

This time you told them it had gone to far and all they did was tell you to lighten up and doubled down saying how ugly he was and you were wasting yourself on him. \n\n\nYou also said that they've never done this with a real person you are interested in before. The fact that they can't and won't let up means you'll never be able to being this guy around them in the future without them being judgemental and cruel. \n\n\nI think you may have outgrown this group.", "NTA\n\nAnd no matter which way you explain it, it was never jokes. Feelings used to get hurt but in the spirit of being light-hearted, they didn't say anything. \n\nThose were not friends and you've outgrown them. If you do indeed become a couple and your friends apologise, how will you all interact knowing what they all think about him?", "normally I (19F) don\u2019t mind a bunch of mockery. It\u2019s what our friendship group hinges on. \n\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong,you *are* NTA. You asked them more than once to stop and they didn\u2019t. \n\nThat having been said though,do you think just *maybe* this sort of thing is a little too common among you all? Next year you won\u2019t be a teen anymore. Perhaps it\u2019s time to tone down the mockery in general?", "ESH.  You have participated in these actions in the past - essentially making fun of others over things about which they have no control.  Now that it's turned back and biting you in the butt, you don't want to play any more -- but you have yet to acknowledge the fundamental disrespect that you and the others hold for people over some pretty shallow standards you've established.\n\nYour losing your friend group - and rightfully so.  They - and you - come across as horrible \"mean girls\" and it's hard to imagine anyone wanting to spend time around you.\n\nGrow the hell up, apologize to those you've wronged and find another group of friends.", "NTA\n\nbut reading your edit\u2026 you realize that making fun of the girl who hooks up (or the act of hooking up)and not the people she hooks up with still makes your friends bullies, right? I\u2019m just saying I\u2019d rather be friendly with someone who hooks up constantly than be friendly with someone who judges people on things that literally do not affect them at all. \n\nOnce again, you\u2019re not an asshole but you must be seriously obtuse if you think what your friends are doing is okay.. \n\nEven making fun of your taste (general taste) isn\u2019t funny. Those 3/10 dudes are probably still better than those 0/10 mean girls you hung out with.", "NTA, they're showing you exactly who they are. You asked them to stop and they doubled down.\n\nMy husband is \"out of my league\"....... he's seriously gorgeous, tall, fit, semi famous (back in the day). There were people in his life who tried to convince him he could do better than a short, dark skinned (lots of colorism in our community), fat, single mother of 3 with a past. 20+ years later, we're still together and heading into retirement with four kids, a couple of grandkids and he just brags on me to everyone about my career, our kids, my looks, how happy he is... Those people are long gone from his life. He cut them loose for disrespecting me. I'm loyal to him for ever.", "I mean, I gotta go with ESH cause it just sounds like a bunch of mean girls.", "I feel like it's weird to have a friendship dynamic like that. Are they your friends or your enemy? How will you ever know? Somebody who truly cares about you wouldn't feel comfortable with that type of relationship. I think you should keep them blocked and find mature friends. No you are not the asshole, just maybe growing up :)", "NTA. \u201cShe told me they were doing it because they didn't want to see me 'waste myself' and that I should go for someone more attractive.\u201d So it wasnt joking anymore. They were straight up and intentionally insulting the guy. \n\nHonestly, that whole friend group sounds toxic. Im all for giving my friends shit, but its always about truly light hearted and non-serious topics that arent based on reality at all. Youre 19. Barely an adult and still learning about who you are. It\u2019s natural that who you are becoming doesnt connect well with who your friends are becoming. They\u2019re critically judging someone simply for his looks when you\u2019re clearly into him. He makes you happy. Thats all that matters. They\u2019re setting themselves up for a life of misery if they value looks above all else.", "Commenting on this one because it popped up on my notifications haha\n\nBut no you\u2019re totally right. We have the same humour and way of joking with each other that we\u2019ve had since we were like 15, and the fact of the matter is I\u2019m 20 very soon. Still young, but not young enough that this way of going about things is particularly necessary.\n\nI suppose because it was the way our friend group functioned for so long, I\u2019ve never really considered the implications when it goes beyond our teasing ways and how toxic it is. It\u2019s definitely something I don\u2019t want to partake in as heavily as it can clearly become hurtful, and likely has in the past, just without complaint.", "The girl who we make fun of for that IS in the group and is one of our friends. As in she joins in in all the laughs and jokes and calls herself a bunch of things too, like we all do. We\u2019ve all kinda accepted the things that we\u2019re known as to one another, and we don\u2019t make those same comments to anyone *outside* of the group.\n\nI can\u2019t speak for everyone obviously, but I\u2019ve never meant it maliciously. I could care less about the friend that hooks up a lot and the friend that doesn\u2019t, but it\u2019s been funny to us that we all have these crude things that we\u2019re \u2018known for\u2019. We don\u2019t ever talk about anyone outside of the groupchat in specifics (up until this point).\n\nWe (or at least I don\u2019t) actually think these mean things we say to one another. We just say then, agree with one another, have a laugh then keep going with our days.\n\nThough I fully get how it looks from an outside perspective, and really, even from an inside perspective knowing that likely, some people in the chat weren\u2019t joking at all.\n\nIt\u2019s dumb teenage humour that we\u2019ve retained up until this point that really, I\u2019m embarrassed we\u2019ve not lost. I never really thought of the implications of how somebody could get hurt because everyone joined in on their own individual jokes and would constantly stir the pot on their own \u2018known for status\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s dumb and toxic of us though, can definitely toast to that.", "Yeah fair enough, thank you", "Yeah I think I\u2019m realising that in perspective. I only ever spoke in jest about things everyone (including the butt of the joke) was laughing about, but i think this is making me reconsider if everyone was joking or not", "Bravo \ud83d\udc4f I get the vibe that you\u2019re a young person with some depth and this is a natural evolution of your character. \n Good luck with the BF and I hope at least a couple of your friends can evolve along with you.", "NTA, but I'd have to take a wild guess that most of this friend group is single. For a reason", "the GROUP DYNAMIC might not be good overall--but people do their own thing.\n\nHowever, there definitely has to be rules to this sort of thing\n\nAND STOP, needs to be the biggest thing--the ability to consent/retract consent for this sort of hazing.  \n\nPlus as you said--before it was always specifically against those in consenting--in the group, not specific to other people.  That too is important.  \n\nPlus there is a huge difference between saying X is a nerd and X is a waste of your and space. (which they did when they said you were wasting your time with him--JUST from a picture, and that you are too pretty for him--JUST from a picture).\n\nI think others have already said it--you may have outgrown this humor--Or you may have just realized how harmful it CAN Be even if done(and done for a long time).  \n\nI'll go for NTA simply because you ASKED repeatedly for them to stop.  It appears that the others never asked for you to stop.  But it wouldn't hurt to do some self-reflection and see if they have asked you(or others in group) to stop in less direct ways.", "NTA. Your friends sound mean-spirited and cruel. I\u2019m glad you found someone nice, funny and handsome who makes you happy.", "NTA, I am the one that fucks around a lot the the group chat with jokes etc kinda similar to your. Sometimes I take it too far and apologize. Your friend should put their pride aside.", "Monica Geller?\n\nNTA Your friends ARE mean girls. Time to upgrade your friends.", "Also, there\u2019s a difference between gentle teasing to OP\u2019s face that she happily participates in and the brutal mocking of a complete stranger behind his back. \n\nOP pointed out that what her friends were doing was not only rude to her crush, but hurtful to her specifically, and they continue to insist they\u2019re right and she shouldn\u2019t like the people she likes. That\u2019s not even a little bit okay. \n\nNTA", "NTA but y'all sound toxic AF.", "When I was in highschool my friends group started making fun of me for not dating at all. Eventually I just stopped talking to them and they never tried to apologize or anything. NTA", "NTA.  Yes, it does sound like you're probably outgrowing this group of friends.", "[removed]", "> I told them to stop it.\n\nAnd this were it should have stopped. If they were decent, they wouldn't care if you \"ruin the mode\" or whatever, they'd stop because you asked and they cared about you, no arguing.\nSo NTA big time. \n\n\nAlso, I want to mention that this guy isn't less valuable because \"he's\" less attractive and you are not \"selling yourself short\". Happy for you for finding him :)", "They\u2019re not making fun of me, they\u2019re making fun of the appearance of the boy i\u2019m interested in.\n\nWouldn\u2019t care if it was just mocking me, we do that everyday."]}
