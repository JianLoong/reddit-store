It\u2019s what our friendship group hinges on. We pick each other apart like crazy and it\u2019s funny to us all, we all giggle and hug about it after. Typically if a joke goes too far, it\u2019s immediately stopped and apologised for. I love these girls like family.\n\nIn the group, we\u2019re known for different things about our love / sex lives. For example, one friend is known for never dating, another for hooking up too much, etc.\n\nI'm known as the one with the bad taste. I like non conventionally attractive guys. I've never minded this. We all take jabs at each other and it's so light hearted that no one can really be upset about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, I've started to talk to another guy. He is 100% my type and my heart genuinely skips whenever I see him. I feel like I've scored a jackpot. We get along like crazy, he's so charismatic, funny, and I love spending time with him. I personally believe he's incredibly attractive in every way.\n\nThe chat asked to see him as we do when we mention new guys and I was hesitant. They were already mocking a tad 'Go on, show us your new 3/10'. But either way I did. They were laughing at every single thing about them. From his hair, to his clothes, to every detail about his face in specifics. They were pointing out every single 'flaw' he had and ripping him to shreds for them.\n\nThey were praising me while tearing him apart. Saying things like 'You're way too pretty to date a guy that looks like an insect' and 'He'd better at least be funny, because you'll have to close your eyes whenever he speaks'. And I was fuming. I really like this guy.\n\nI told them to stop it. That I don't care if they generally laugh at my taste, but that pulling apart the features of a specific guy like that was unfair. They told me to lighten up, and that they were saying that because they believe I'm way out of his league and am selling myself short.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI left the chat after days of them sending the same two photos and laughing at him. He was the main topic. I got a message from one of my friends basically telling me to lighten up and that she didn't get why I was so upset about it, when it had been a running joke in our chat for years.\n\nI told her why I felt the way I did, about how I disliked they were hating someone I was so interested in because they don't consider him attractive. She told me they were doing it because they didn't want to see me 'waste myself' and that I should go for someone more attractive. She said they were sorry I took offence, but I should come back to the chat because we all take digs at each other. I told her we never take personal digs, and instead laugh at each other generally. Her response was a shrug emoji and a laughing emoji.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI blocked her after this and have been actively ignoring the others' attempts to contact me. I've vowed not to message them again until I get an actual apology.\n\nAt the same time I feel like I'm maybe being too harsh. They're right in saying I played into this joke for years, but never with a specific real life person.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681808880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qgvyh/aita_for_refusing_to_talk_to_my_friends_over_a/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think this comes down to if this is the type of people you want to spend your time around, I don\u2019t see how this \u201cjoke\u201d is very funny.  There is a lot more to relationships than looks.", "NTA. They need to respect your boundary.", "NTA and I don't think you are being too harsh. You have explained yourself repeatedly and they are ignoring your pleas. They are souring your crush by degrading the the person you like.", "NTA  \nJoking with friends is great.  \nBut once a line has been over-stepped and its made clear to the offender.  \nAn apology is definitely due.", "NTA. Your friends seem like very shallow people and you do not, not at all. It isn't up to them to decide who is or isn't good enough for you, and continuing the bullshit after you asked them not to shows they don't really care how you're feeling.", "NTA it looks like you go for guys with depth, character and personality over shallow looks. That doesnt make a guy a 3/10 at all. I never liked dating pretty guys who had no drive or brains. The thing is when I started dating my hubby in my teens my friends were like, you cant be serious? What do you see in him, he is ugly! But as time wore on and he climbed the professional ladder and his looks matured, those same friends at a reunion made snarky comments of oh, well haven't you done well for yourself and other comments that are equally misogynistic. It sounds like your friends are very immature and you have outgrown them.", "NTA. You need better friends.", "You're not refusing to talk to your friends due to a long term joke. You're refusing to talk to them because they can't respect your perfectly reasonable boundaries, and they tore apart someone you liked based on nothing but looks. If this wasn't bad enough, none of them actually think their behaviour was inappropriate and have just doubled down it.\n\nNta", "NTA. \n\nYour \u201cfriends\u201d seem very shallow.

I go for \u201cnerdy\u201d guys and I know my friends don\u2019t find them attractive, but **I** do and *that\u2019s* what matters. \n\nAlso, you said that if something is taken too far, your friends normally cease this mockery. But they haven\u2019t this time and are essentially belittling you and your guy. So screw them. Unless they can give you a wholeheartedly sincere apology, I suggest making new friends.", "NTA.

As you said, saying that they don't find him attractive is fine, but picking on every single physical flaw about him is just plain disrespectful. Why would you comment on someone else's appearance.

They just seem not really good people.", "NTA a joke is only funny when everyone is laughing. You explained that you didn\u2019t like what they were doing and they continued. Ripping someone to shreds is not funny it is bullying and disrespectful to someone who they have no business being so disrespectful about. A guy could look amazing but be abusive or boring or even a cheater, he may not? But what really matters most is who he is and how he acts and treats you and if they are not asking about that then they really are not good friends in the first place. Please don\u2019t play these stupid games it is very telling that you are now noticing that it is a very immature game and downright stupid to talk about people who you don\u2019t know anything about but who you\u2019re friends like.", "NTA, just because a joke's been running for years, it doesn't magicly become less offensive.\n\nYour friends are litterally being shapist behind the mask of \"we do this because we care about you\" which is infact a bs.  \n\n\nI'm so disgusted the fact that they made fun of the guy's looks despite the fact that you let them know you really liked him, while they don't know a single thing about his character.", "NTA \n\nYour friends should be more considerate of your feelings and I do agree that what they did in this situation was crossing the line.  \nObviously you\u2019re all allowed to have different opinions but they shouldn\u2019t be trashing the guy you\u2019re really interested in just because they think he\u2019s not your type. Also, the fact that they care so much about peoples\u2019 appearances rather than focusing on internal qualities or personality traits shows a lack of maturity on their part. \n\nYou\u2019re not in the wrong for not wanting to message them anymore cos sometimes you need to remove people from your life that aren\u2019t healthy to be around or speak to.

They broke up. GF regretted it. I feel so bad for her because the odds are she threw away a lovely life with a great guy and will regret it forever.\n\nOP: chemistry is important. Looks are not. You are so wise to step away from these friends. Maybe someday some of them will admit they were immature and nasty and you will be friends again. For now, you are so right to go your own way."]}
