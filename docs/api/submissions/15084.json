Typically if a joke goes too far, it\u2019s immediately stopped and apologised for. I love these girls like family.\n\nIn the group, we\u2019re known for different things about our love / sex lives. For example, one friend is known for never dating, another for hooking up too much, etc.\n\nI'm known as the one with the bad taste. I like non conventionally attractive guys. I've never minded this. We all take jabs at each other and it's so light hearted that no one can really be upset about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, I've started to talk to another guy. He is 100% my type and my heart genuinely skips whenever I see him. I feel like I've scored a jackpot. We get along like crazy, he's so charismatic, funny, and I love spending time with him. I personally believe he's incredibly attractive in every way.\n\nThe chat asked to see him as we do when we mention new guys and I was hesitant. They were already mocking a tad 'Go on, show us your new 3/10'. But either way I did. They were laughing at every single thing about them. From his hair, to his clothes, to every detail about his face in specifics. They were pointing out every single 'flaw' he had and ripping him to shreds for them.\n\nThey were praising me while tearing him apart. Saying things like 'You're way too pretty to date a guy that looks like an insect' and 'He'd better at least be funny, because you'll have to close your eyes whenever he speaks'. And I was fuming. I really like this guy.\n\nI told them to stop it. That I don't care if they generally laugh at my taste, but that pulling apart the features of a specific guy like that was unfair. They told me to lighten up, and that they were saying that because they believe I'm way out of his league and am selling myself short.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI left the chat after days of them sending the same two photos and laughing at him. He was the main topic. I got a message from one of my friends basically telling me to lighten up and that she didn't get why I was so upset about it, when it had been a running joke in our chat for years.\n\nI told her why I felt the way I did, about how I disliked they were hating someone I was so interested in because they don't consider him attractive. She told me they were doing it because they didn't want to see me 'waste myself' and that I should go for someone more attractive. She said they were sorry I took offence, but I should come back to the chat because we all take digs at each other. I told her we never take personal digs, and instead laugh at each other generally. Her response was a shrug emoji and a laughing emoji.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI blocked her after this and have been actively ignoring the others' attempts to contact me. I've vowed not to message them again until I get an actual apology.\n\nAt the same time I feel like I'm maybe being too harsh.

What do you see in him, he is ugly! But as time wore on and he climbed the professional ladder and his looks matured, those same friends at a reunion made snarky comments of oh, well haven't you done well for yourself and other comments that are equally misogynistic.
