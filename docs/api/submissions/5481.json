There's always wiggle room in friendships but messing with someone's livelihood is too much.", "NTA. Do you have signed contracts? Be prepared to lose that friend.", "I don\u2019t think you should sue her; you should turn her debt over to a collection agency. If you sue you\u2019ll probably never see your money.

If you need the money that badly, you need to find a new line of work.", "NTA", "NTA...BUT the costs involved with a lawsuit, even if judged in your favor, will likely not be worth the amount of money you recover (if it ever gets paid anyway). Plus, you will also likely lose a friendship over it. So, at this point, I would ask yourself if it's really worth it, and in the end chalk it up to a lesson learned. Don't sell yourself short in the future, don't give discounts, and don't continue working for unpaying clients. I learned this one the hard way as a small business owner also, and I sympathize.", "One of the things I have learned is that people who want and get huge discount never pay their debts.

You can also write a formal letter that you will charge at normal rates.", "NTA. Do it.", "In their eyes only. Sue away. That\u2019s what you have to do to faithless deadbeats.", "NTA.
