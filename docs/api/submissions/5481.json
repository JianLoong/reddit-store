Don\u2019t do something illegal (withholding pay) if you don\u2019t want to appear in court/face legal repercussions", "NTA although it could cause issues with your friendship.", "NTA and yeah, you might lose your friend, but if my mom was doing this to one of my friends I'd be pissed off at her on my friend's behalf anyway. There's always wiggle room in friendships but messing with someone's livelihood is too much.", "NTA. Do you have signed contracts? Be prepared to lose that friend.", "I don\u2019t think you should sue her; you should turn her debt over to a collection agency. If you sue you\u2019ll probably never see your money. BUT, I would also expect to lose the friendship. Is it really worth the hassle for 3 months of work at 25% rate? Small business owner to small business owner I think you call this a lesson learned and get a retainer up front.", "NTA - you're never going to see that money.  It is much cheaper to just move on.  If you need the money that badly, you need to find a new line of work.", "NTA", "NTA...BUT the costs involved with a lawsuit, even if judged in your favor, will likely not be worth the amount of money you recover (if it ever gets paid anyway). Plus, you will also likely lose a friendship over it. So, at this point, I would ask yourself if it's really worth it, and in the end chalk it up to a lesson learned. Don't sell yourself short in the future, don't give discounts, and don't continue working for unpaying clients. I learned this one the hard way as a small business owner also, and I sympathize.", "One of the things I have learned is that people who want and get huge discount never pay their debts. Because they believe in they are entitled to have this discount they also believe in that they are entitled not to pay. Do not negotiate or accept any more discounts and delays. You can also write a formal letter that you will charge at normal rates.", "NTA. Do it.", "In their eyes only. Sue away. That\u2019s what you have to do to faithless deadbeats.", "NTA. But, before filing in the court, have an attorney send a request for the complete payment with a deadline. That might be enough encouragement to get her to pay. Then, end your business arrangement with her.", "NTA sue her your services aren\u2019t free", "NTA but it's probably a waste of time.  If a client says they can't even pay HALF your rate, that means they won't pay at all.  Don't take the job, no matter who it is.", "NTA do it", "YTA and so is she. You walked into this one. Never do business with a friend for This very reason", "Edited.\n\nYWNBTA - You have done more than required to resolve this amicably.", "Exactly my thoughts.", "The person has already shown himself to not be a friend.\n\nOP will lose no one pursuing this.", "How does that make OP an AH?", "Why does this mean she will be the asshole?", "For suing, they should have understood the risks. You don\u2019t put yourself in a position where you might have to sue your friends mom.", "You're ridiculous. She has every legal right to sue.", "Nah, YTA for suggesting this.", "And when you don't pay your invoices, THERE'S A **_RISK_** YOU'RE GONNA GET SUED.", "And if you keep working for your friends mom after she stiffs you on The first invoice\u2026\u2026..", "NTA. I'd take it further and charge her the full rate you normally charge for the delinquent months due to breech of your agreement.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been more than patient enough. Hopefully you\u2019ve saved all the text messages and other forms of communication", "NTA.  Please tell me you have a written contract?  Text messages?  Anything memorializing your agreement?  If not, you may not prevail.  You're not in business to work for free.  In future, make every client sign a contract that specifies what you will do, what you will be paid, and when that payment is due.", "Sending the debt to a collections agency, putting a black mark on her credit report\u2026that might do the trick", "NTA \n\nI'd just change the passwords / credentials and watch how fast she paid", "NTA", "NTA Best option is to explain to the friend what has happened and specifically show them the \"amount of hours\" worked upon it. Explain that you need paying for these hours, as like all of us you have bills to pay, and that if you don't then may need to take drastic action.\nThat way the friend may be able to do something, and at least will understand.", "Maybe a better question is, is the amount of money worth destroying her child\u2019s friendship?\n\nNTA\n\nGet what you\u2019re owed.", "Oh wow. I meant to say YWNBTA.", "That makes more sense!  Lol. I was really confused!", "That makes them too trusting not an ass hole.", "NTA but let it be a lesson for next time never mix business with friends and family and never ends well", "op=NTA\n\nyour friend isn't a friend.", "NTA you did the work you deserve the payment of she is ducking you then you have to do what you have to do.", "NTA - but, as others have said, you will most likely lose the friend.", "NTA but be prepared to lose the friendship.", "NTA. She created the situation and has done nothing to fix it. Tell your friend what is happening and ask what she would do in your shoes. You might find that they agree with your only option to collect. Press ahead and get paid then cut all ties to your friend's mother. She is obviously a user. You might even use her own social media to advertise her dishonesty, locking her out til you are paid.", "NTA, but you will be if you continue to allow such little value to be placed on your work. If this is your business, establish a 10%-off friends and family discount, but write it into the contract. You're providing a valuable service which requires time, skill, and persistence. You need to convey to your clients how much they will profit from your work. And, include language in your contract about late fees/litigation/follow-up. 75% off discount - not ok. You got this.", "NTA and you own her marketing presence so I\u2019d take it ALL down until she pays up.", "Never due business with family/friends without a clad iron contract. I have only one friend whom I would trust to do that with because:\n\n1. I have worked with him numerous times on university projects and I can always trust him\n2. He worked with his Dad's business for 4 years and he has good experience\n3. I've talked to his Dad's employees, and they really like the company . Many have been there for +15 years.\n4. He is good with money.\n5. He loves his wife and treats her well.", "Not to mention the time OP spent, constantly having to get in contact with her.", "NTA  But don't bother suing, it's rarely worth it.  Even if you win most likely you won't collect anything.  But even if you don't sue, your friendship is probably over anyway.", "NTA - She's not your friend's mum, she's a client.", "NTA but how much cash we talkin?", "Nta, she agreed to pay you for services you provided. Don't mix business and personal life though, this is how it usually ends", "NTA but I recommend you talk to your friend and her Mom about working out a payment plan which would be a lot less expensive and stressful than taking them to court", "NTA. And it's kind of crazy that she'd risk upsetting someone  with access to her social media account.\n\nIt would be unprofessional of you,  but I imagine you could cause major reputational damage to her.", "NTA. But I would just undo or delete everything that I had done so that everything was put back in its original state. I think you're gonna loose your friend tho if you take any action regardless.", "NTA. I hope you have it in writing. If not, you'll probably see nothing. If you dont and you still have access to her account, I'd shut it down or delete it.", "Absolutely not. You rendered services for her business at a discounted rate & she still did not pay. You deserve to be paid for your time.", "Sounds like this person wasnt much of a friend to OP anyways for taking advantage of them and their work.", "Be super careful if you choose to do this. I don't know where you live, obviously, but in my country, this would be illegal. I used to do similar work (web design and media etc) and it is illegal to, for example, take a client's site down due to non-payment or past-due bills. It can be a tricky area, legally, so don't do something like that without making sure you're not doing something that would let *her* sue *you*.", "This is what I was thinking", "To be fair, the friend could also be pissed at their mother. They are seperate people. They may not have known their mother would do this. We don't have enough info on the actual friend to make a judgment on their relationship.", "You need to be paid for the work you have done.\n\nYou have given her plenty of time to pay you.\n\nI'd just email her and say, if I don't get my wages for the hour's you owe me for the work I have done for you. I will be deleting all of the work but also taking you to small claims court.\nYour choice.\n\nNTA", "Y T A for letting that go on as long as you have. She should have gotten a single month\u2019s grace period max. You should have stopped services after that month was up. It was pretty clear that you were getting the run around after she skipped out on your agreed upon \u2018makeup payment date\u2019. If she didn\u2019t have the money the first time, what makes you think she will suddenly have 4x that amount later on? \n\nGet to suing and next time do it much sooner.", "NTA. As others have mentioned, it may cost you a friend. But you absolutely should be paid for your work. I really hope you write up some kind of contract with her. If not, you'll have a hard time taking it to court. If you do have a contact, send her 1 final written notice of payment due in full by X date. If payment is not submitted in full by your specified date, legal action will be taken. Make the due date reasonable, but also don't negotiate on the date. She's already proven that she's flakey. If you give her any wiggle room, something will \"suddenly come up\" just like it always does.", "NTA. Have you looked into lawyers or set up a meeting with one to see your options?", "Take down all the social media you put up for her. Change all the passwords if you can. Refuse to give her the passwords or put the stuff back up until she pays you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but before you sue, sniff around and find out if your client will be able to pay.  You'll win in a heartbeat if you've kept the needed records, but if she doesn't actually have the money you'll end up with a judgement you can't enforce.", "NTA, but the likelihood is that you'll lose the friend and be left with no money.  Sounds like she's broke.  Even if you win, if she's truly broke how will you get your money?\n\nNot telling you you're in the wrong, just might be worth thinking about if it's worth it to you.", "No, everything you said dis bulkshit. The friends mom put herself in a position to be sued. Having trust in a friend and their family does not make OP an asshole. .", "That last point is one of the biggest things that make you trustworthy, I\u2019m a woman and I trust men who love their wives, it\u2019s so obvious too"]}
