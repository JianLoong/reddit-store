My brother, Toby (25).\n\n2 weeks ago, my husband and I traveled to another country on business, it lasted 3 days and we stayed 4 more days and took our children with us. \n\nI told my mum and dad about the trip and my dad commented that Toby really wanted to go there and that I should ask him if he wanted to go. \n\nThe idea seemed great to me and I asked him if he wanted to go with us, but he said that he would even be able to pay for the tickets and hotel, but he would have no money to spend there, so he would have to go this time. \n\nI thought to myself and talked to my husband, we proposed the idea of \u200b\u200bhim being our children's nanny and we would pay for the ticket, hotel, food and any expenses he had there (within limits). \n\nThe proposal would be: he would babysit my children for the 3 days we would be working, but they would have my card to do whatever they wanted and at night we would go out together for something to eat. And afterwards he would be free to do as he pleased, for we would be with them. Our only request was for one night on this trip for him to stay with our children so that my husband and I could have a night alone. \n\nWell, he sent a \"LOL\" to my message and said that he didn't need a favor with all those conditions and that he wasn't that desperate. \n\nIt hurt me, I'll admit, but I've moved on and text-blocked him. \n\nMy other sister (24F) heard about the proposal from our parents and asked if this proposal would still be open for her. I said yes. \n\nToby apparently had a change of heart, because the day after my sister asked, he called me saying he had thought it through, apologized saying he felt embarrassed and asked if he could still go under those conditions. I said that our sister had already agreed to go and that unfortunately he missed the chance (between him denying it and my sister offering it was 1 week). \n\nHe wasn't happy saying this was something between me and him but that I couldn't wait to replace him with another relative and that if I hadn't blocked him I would have seen that he apologized for being rude and that he was embarassed. \n\nThis was actually true, but he could have called me or even come to the house to explain and he didn't, but I said couldn't offer them to me because my sister was already on board. \n\nThe trip was great. My sister preferred this romantic night to be on her babysitting days and the last 4 days, she went to other places and some with us. \n\nTo this day, my brother is upset with me and barely talks, but I don't think it's my fault. \n\nAITA?\n\nExtra: My sibilings and I know how to walk around the city where we went to travel and get by ourselves, because we already traveled several times together there or with our parents when we were younger, so I was ok of him staying with my children alone and he is great with my children (my sister too ).\n\nExtra 2: I blocked him because he was still talking about what a terrible proposal and stuff, I didn't feel like reading that kind of stuff and he was still typing when I blocked him, but after 3 days I unblocked him, I just got stressed by the way he was saying it and decided to cut it that moment", "created_utc": 1689516689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1517a0r/aita_for_offering_my_brother_to_babysit_my/", "score": 226, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were under no obligation to him once he was rude to you + didn't want to do it. Matter settled.\n\nYou were entitled to look for other options since securing child care was necessary for this trip.  What is it with families wanting everyone to accommodate the immature and reactive members and keep them appeased rather than try to hold them accountable for their actions? \n\nMaybe this will make him think twice about his behavior in the future.", "> He wasn't happy saying this was something between me and him\n\nuhh no you have kids, you need a babysitter, brother refused, he's out of the equation.\n\n> but that I couldn't wait to replace him with another relative \n\nYour brother sounds terribly immature lol. You needed a babysitter, he refused, you chose another babysitter, why should you have to wait for him to get his head out of his ass? Why should you do any favors for someone who is rude to you?\n\n> and that if I hadn't blocked him I would have seen that he apologized for being rude and that he was embarassed.\n\nSo he was rude and he resents you for blocking him and \"not seeing his apology\" ? Well now he has to apologize again for not taking accountability for his actions and not admitting that you owe him NOTHING and that he was in the wrong from start to finish.\n\nHe has some nerve. NTA. I strongly suggest that you don't do him any more favors until he matures a lot and apologizes for blaming you for his own errors.", "NTA\n\nHe apologized but he didn\u2019t say he wanted to go on the text till after your sister offer. Sorry but brother couldn\u2019t expect for you to sit around waiting for him to decide he wanted to come. You respected his opinion when he denied. Would had been rude and AH to take the sister offered because brother now wants to go.", "NTA.  Toby fafo.", "    V", "NTA\n\nHe's salty because he turned down a great deal. Glad your sister went and had fun.", "ESH\n\nHis response was rude but I\u2019m truly confused as to why you would text block him. That\u2019s honestly so incredibly childish to me, he gave you his answer and you had the ability to communicate and say, \u201chey that\u2019s a pretty rude response.\u201d \n\nMy siblings have been rude to me before but I wouldn\u2019t block them, I still want to chat with them. Honestly, I\u2019m flabbergasted that you\u2019d block his texts, like grow up babes. \n\nThat said, you\u2019re not an Asshole for giving the job to your sister. Sounds like she\u2019s better suited for the job and it\u2019ll be a better fit.", "NTA.  You are a businesswoman so you are familiar with contracts.  You made an offer (reasonable expenses and four days free in exchange for babysitting services).  Your brother chose not to accept.  Your potential contract with him was dead.  Your sister then made an offer (reasonable expenses and four days free in exchange for babysitting services).  You accepted and that formed a contract.  You were in a time crunch and did what you had to do.\n\nYour brother has no one to be upset with but himself.  Had you offered me that deal, I would have jumped on it.  I'm sure it would have been easy enough to find things to do with your kids on the days I took care of them and, like your sister, I would have asked you to do date night on one of the days I was already \"working.\"  The rest of the time would have been mine to do as I pleased and I could have done whatever I (reasonably) wanted on your dime.  What's not to love?\n\nIf you ever have a similar situation arise, I'd give your sister \"right of first refusal.\"  If she takes the opportunity, great.  If not, then go offer it to your brother.  Your sister seems more mature about the situation.  \n\nAs for your brother, if he keeps whining, there's a familiar phrase from my youth that springs to mind:  \"You snooze, you lose!\"  It's not like he needed to check his schedule and make sure he was free.  He just wanted a free trip with no responsibilities.  He snoozed by not jumping on the offer right away and extended his nap by not calling you the very next day.  That's on him.", "A little but TA. For blocking him. 25 YO males aren\u2019t as emotionally mature as women. So it checks out that that would be his response and then he apologizes. I agree that he could have called. \n\nAlso, if that\u2019s how the trip planning started you likely dodged a bullet with some issues on the trip.\n\nSo overall, NTA. Hopefully there\u2019s a chance to patch things. Sibs are important.", "NTA. There isn\u2019t some mandatory waiting period after your brother said no. He said no, end of story. If so inclined, and the occasion comes up maybe offer again, but there\u2019s no obligation to do so", "You made a very reasonable offer. He said no and your sis jumped at the chance. He was stupid for saying no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "Yta.  Because you blocked him.  Offering to pay his way in exchange for babysitting wasn\u2019t unreasonable.  Nor was it unreasonable for him to say it wasn\u2019t worth it for him.  It was a very petty response and reaction on your part.  I also don\u2019t think it was rude for him to decline a trip with the conditions you set.  Imo he had nothing to apologize for.  You made an arrangement with your sister and you don\u2019t owe an apology for that.  You do owe an apology for blocking him and by doing so escalating the situation.  People are allowed to say no to an arrangement weighted in your favor.", "Because he was still talking about what a terrible proposal and stuff, I didn't feel like reading that kind of stuff and he was still typing when I blocked him, but after 3 days I unblocked him, I just got stressed by the way he waa saying it and decided to cut it so as not to get angry", "Lol well technically first served passed. \n\nNTA OP\u2026 maybe a little extreme with the blocking. You could have just muted the convo.", "I didn\u2019t find his response rude at all.  He declined.  OP is a bit of TA because she blocked him.", "Plenty of 25 year old men have kids of their own. \n\nSeems that people on here think you aren't a fully grown adult in your 20s?!", "No but 25 is an adult with a fully developed adult brain and there are other ways to contact a person when you are blocked. Brother wanted them to pay but not help with children so he said no. Sister was more than willing to take the deal because op needed help. Brother knew children couldn\u2019t stay alone so some form of a nanny was necessary. Plans were made during the week, brother now is angry because he didn\u2019t get to go on trip. Wonder if brother was hoping the deal for watching the children would get better so he could go on trip but spend very little time being a nanny . Brother said no, so he suffers consequences of staying home.", "You should edit this in to your post, most responses are wondering why you blocked him and this gives much more context.", "That's kind of a character flaw you should look into it", "Interesting. I rarely block people, so that came off as extreme to me. NTA for replacing him though. Sounds like he might have complained the whole time he was watching your kids.", "Cool, you didn't. LOL (I'm not being rude - if brother can respond with that and not be rude, then  I can to.)\n\nAnyway, we don't know beyond \"LOL\" verbatim what he said since OP was paraphrasing it, and she found his response hurtful. So I'm going to defer to OP.", "Idk where this dumb idea came from. I know they say your brain isn\u2019t developed until you\u2019re 25, but that doesn\u2019t excuse anything. A 15 year old is more mature than a 5 year old so I don\u2019t understand why people all of a sudden want to excuse people for \u201conly being 25\u201d", "You mean a character flaw for him right? He could just say no without spamming her about how insulting the offer was to him when it was a ridiculously generous one. He was likely going to receive thousands in compensation with the all expenses paid trip.", "NTA you snooze you lose. That\u2019s just the way it is sometimes", "NTA. He said no and was quite ungrateful about the offer, you made the offer after being asked by your parents and didn't even need a nanny. Sounds like your sister knows how to appreciate a good thing.", "NTA- it was a really solid deal on his end, especially with your kids being old enough to not need absolute constant supervision, obviously don't just turn em loose either, but it's not like they're only 5 or 6 years old", "NTA.. serves him right", "NTA\n\nHe had an offer to go on the trip and laughed. Your sister contacted you, wanted the same offer and had a great time. Sucks to be him. He was too late. \n\nYour kids are of an age where spending time with them is less care and more fun. I'd have snatched your hand off at that age. What you were asking was not unreasonable and balanced everyone's time and fun fairly.", "You cave your brother a wonderful.  Babysit for 3 days two older children, and then he would have 4 days to himself.\n\nHe was bit rude when he texted \"LOL' is response to the deal, and more.  he was continuing to poke at you with his texts.\n\nYou were peeved, and text blocked him.  You made the same offer to you sister, who readily accepted.\n\nThen brother found out the deal was rescinded, and was angry.  He missed out on a great offer to travel.\n\nYour brother didn't have to continue to poke you.  He could have just turned the offer down (which he did). or he could have asked for a day or two to think it over.\n\nHe wants to blame someone else (your) because he of his behavior.\n\nHe FAFO.\n\nGlad you had a nice time with your sister and your family.\n\nNext time, maybe brother wont be so antagonistic, or quick decide on what sounded like a very fair offer.\n\nNTA", "Nta", "Clear NTA", "Nta", "NTA he was unblocked and had more than enough time. He apologized great but doesn't mean the offer is still gonna be there. He can say what he wants but he is not entitled to the offer.", "Nta \u201cyou snooze you lose \u201c", "NTA.

You don't have to be friends with people like that but you can't make it suddenly mean something different to someone else. that's your opinion lol.", "You just have a different interpration of what blocking someone on your phone really means.\n\nYou take it as an attack on you when the other person needs a break from pointless arguing because one party won\u2019t stop. You act like there is only one reason to do it and it\u2019s unreasonable. Maybe not you specifically but could you ever consider the person being blocked should be cut out themselves?\n\nReading inbetween the lines I would guess you get out of control sometimes and hate when people ignore you.", "Projecting?\n\nWell my brother and his wife block people all the time and they're in their 40s so yes it absolutely seems pathetic and childish to me. They particularly do it when someone is trying to hold them accountable for their behavior. \n\nFor getting spammed w/ negative comments I agree - the only person I've had to block is an ex who sent repeat abusive commentary so yes absolutely that's what it's for. \n\nbut during an argument? That's indeed pathetic and childish", "It is totally different because if there is an emergency in three days you will still have them blocked.\n\nIt seems enormously childish - in your example the person is still able to call but when blocked a person cannot even place that call. It's only good for if you never want to hear from someone again, not for temporary situations.", "> my brother and his wife block people all the time and they're in their 40s so yes it absolutely seems pathetic and childish to me. They particularly do it when someone is trying to hold them accountable for their behavior.\n\njust posted this above so yeah", "No but it probably means you and your core friend group are probably over emotional, and use words like bad energy when talking about a relative she obviously cares about", "I'm in my 40's, if someone blocked me I would interpret that as a permanent \"go away forever\" message", "I don\u2019t block but I\u2019ll mute people. My phone won\u2019t notify me when I get the messages which gives me time to mentally prepare to read them on my own time.", "That said, you\u2019re not an Asshole for giving the job to your sister.", "It's not like he needed to check his schedule and make sure he was free.", "A block doesn't come with an expiration date. A block sends a message that we are done forever on whatever platform it is. \n\nI only have one sibling but if she blocked me I would never check back to see if I was unblocked", "\"Different definitions of blocking\"\n\nThere's just blocking.  It's literally the same thing no matter who you are. \n\nI think you mean that different people have ideas on what blocking socially entails after that point.  Blocking itself is the same.  We all click the same buttons to block.", "Means socially?  \n\nBecause the block button does the same thing for everyone.  \n\n> Maybe not you specifically but could you ever consider the person being blocked should be cut out themselves?\n\nWhich is why it would stay permanent.   \n\nI personally have never been blocked.  I've had to block two people and I took the decision seriously.   \n\nI've had 3 others I've had to consider blocking but I used my big girl words and explained they were being unreasonable and if they didn't stop harassing me then they'd be cut from my life for being this unreasonable and rude.  Those 3 wised up and apologized. They quieted down and we talked civilly in the following days.  The other 2 did not.   \n\nHitting the block button is the same few clicks, but when you're making those clicks you're directly saying \"I don't think you're a good enough person to be worth using my words to deescalate this or you didn't listen if I did.\"  That is the same for everyone.  You either didn't take the time to try, or they didn't care that you tried.   \n\nThe question after that is - do you respect yourself enough to have standards for who is in your life?   Dramatic people that have to have the pot stirred will unblock and do the dance many times.  I will cut those people because there's no point to keeping that level of immaturity around to drag you down.   \n\nIf you're going to unblock without already receiving a thorough apology and discussion, then you either don't respect yourself enough to keep people out that need to stay out or you didn't recognize what blocking says to others about how you don't value relationships enough to try first.", "Lol so admit you are projecting?\n\nErrr if yes you use it to block people who are being toxic during an argument. That\u2019s the point.\n\nAlso could you talk about your emergency point again? Or you realize it was a bottom barrel excuse?", "The Island of Conclusions wants to impose immigration restrictions now, to prevent you from jumping there.", "Lmao who blocked you? Your daughter who hates you?", "Hey I'd much rather join you in the peninsula of sarcasm to cover up self reflection but what can we do", "I mean, I understand when you're like 13 and barely in the world yet, you don't understand yet that you're allowed to not engage with other people's negativity.  Children usually think that they are obligated to form an opinion about literally everything and then discuss it to death with the world!\n\nBut when you get a couple of decades under your belt and you realize how short life is, you stop giving a f when someone else is ranting and raving about something and bringing down the mood.  I only have a certain number of years left in my life; I can spend that letting other people annoy me, or I can just cut that energy straight out and let people back in once they've worked it out for themselves.\n\nDon't worry, child, you'll get to my place sooner or later."]}
