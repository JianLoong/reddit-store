{"id": 6488, "submission_id": "103blj0", "title": "AITA for smoking weed in my living room on the day that my two younger cousins visited?", "selftext": "So here's the deal. I (19M) smoke weed all day, every day. It's just a normal  part of my routine and I don't see anything wrong with it, and this is not something that I want to be judged on. My mom is completely against me smoking weed, and she's always telling me to stop.  I believe that cannabis is nature's medicine and that society is  oppressive to those who use it. It has helped me in so many ways and it upsets me that it's still stigmatized.\n\nMy mom told me a few days ago that my uncle and younger cousins (4 and 6 years old) would be over around 3PM yesterday, and asked me to not smoke on that day. She always gets upset if she sees me smoking, so I didn't do it while she was home.  She went to the grocery store in the morning and I figured it would be okay to  blaze up in the living room with the windows open before my cousins showed up.\n\nWell as it turns out, my uncle and two cousins showed up early and walked in right as I was in the middle of smoking a joint and lounging on the couch in my underwear. It was a really embarrassing moment, and I'm sure my small cousins were shocked to see me like that. To make matters worse, they saw me coughing in a haze of smoke as they walked in. My uncle was upset and he screamed at me for smoking in front of the children and being \"irresponsible.\" He told me that I needed to grow up and start thinking  about the consequences of my actions. I could tell that he was really disappointed in me, and the whole situation made me really frustrated. \n\nI know this was not a good situation and I regret that my cousins had to see me like that. But here's the thing: I don't think I did anything wrong. My mom told me the wrong arrival time, so how was I supposed to know that my cousins would be coming over early? And I don't see what the big deal is about smoking weed in my own home, as long as I'm not bothering anyone. If I had been told the correct time, this would have been avoided.\n\n**TL;DR:  I smoked weed in my living room while my mom was at the grocery store and my uncle and young cousins showed up early. My mom gave me the wrong arrival time and I don't think I did anything wrong by smoking weed in my own home.**", "created_utc": 1672858430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103blj0/aita_for_smoking_weed_in_my_living_room_on_the/", "score": 9278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA", "YTA on so many levels, but let's start w/ a couple of the most the most basic ones that I can't believe you don't know:\n1. Don't smoke weed inside the house and especially not a shared space. It isn't your house, your mom doesn't like it, and it reeks. It is overall very rude. If you want to smoke in the living room, get your own place or move in w/ like-minded pot-heads.\n\nNo matter what time your uncle showed up, the livingroom would have reeked. \n\n2. Don't get high before a meeting up w/ people who don't want to deal w/ someone who is high.

Why are you sitting around in your Mom's living room.in your underwear? Cut that out.

Absolutely not. If your mother asks you to not smoke weed (in what very much sounds like her home and not yours) that day, and not only do you smoke but you blaze up in the middle of the living room (which we both know would reek of weed even with windows open in that circumstance), then YTA. If it's not so cold that you can be in your underwear with the windows open you could've taken a walk.", "Whose living room was this, exactly?

Do you do anything else? Do you have a job, or attend classes, or even help around the home? \n\nSounds like you have some major growing up to do. If you don\u2019t like her rules, move out. Simple as that.", "YTA.  19 years old, who sits around in his underwear all day smoking weed.  \nYour mom must be so proud.  /s \nGrow up and adult better", "YTA. Not your house, it's your MOM'S house and you're just living in it. She made a reasonable request: do not expose your underage cousins to smoke.

And also, why the hell would you do it on *the day of, in the living room, in your underwear?* It's almost like you were *trying* to get caught. Not to mention the disrespect of not following your mom's rules. You've ruined your uncle and cousin's perspectives on you. Your mom warned you. You blew her off and did it anyway. You got caught, and you blamed her for it. You really need to grow up, dude.", "YTA.\n\nI'll make it nice for you and break it down a bit. \n\n1.\n\n\n>I (19M) smoke weed all day, every day.\n\nSo you do not do anything else?? No school?? No job?? Not even chores?? You laze around, your mother pays the bills, does all the chores and you do not even help her one bit. BUT THEN...\n\n2.\n\n>in my own home\n\nIt is not your home. You do not pay anything towards it and you do not even help out. It is your mothers home and she asked you not to smoke.\n\n3.\n\n>My mom told me the wrong arrival time, so how was I supposed to know that my cousins would be coming over early?\n\nNow you start blaming your mom. She might have told a different time but people can arrive early. She didn't even know that herself. But the time shouldn't matter. Why not, you might ask. Well...\n\n>asked me to not smoke on that day\n\nShe asked you not to smoke the entire day. Because even with windows open it smells. Because there might be ashes, or some smoke still clinging to the ceiling. Or people might come over earlier. And I doubt they were hours early, most likely 15 minutes?? Maybe 30. That would not have been enough time to let the smell out. She asked for a reason and you failed to listen. It's HER house, she sets the rules. Lastly:\n\n4.\n\n>as long as I'm not bothering anyone\n\nYou're clearly bothering your mother. And smoke damages paint and leaves stains. So smoke outside. But best, stop smoking. Because it might help as medicine in some cases, but I have not heard a single medical reason why you should smoke all day every day.\n\nYTA. Grow up. You behave emberrasingly for someone your age. Signed, someone not even a year older.", "YTA. Both for doing this and for smoking weed in your Mom's house when she's against it. Want to smoke weed all day? Then do it in your own apartment. Grow up, dude.", "YTA and I say this as someone who smokes weed all day everyday for medical reasons. When I lived with other people in their houses, I respected their wishes and smoked outside rain or shine. It is rude to put your choices on someone else, regardless of how you feel and how stigmatized you feel it is. Your mother made a very simple request and it\u2019s her house. It would not have been hard to comply but it sounds like what you really did was try to make a point and it backfired.", "YTA - not for smoking weed, but for doing it in a room that everyone uses. Why not stick to your bedroom?", "YTA. And it sounds like it\u2019s your mom\u2019s home, not yours. If you want to have full run of your living environment where no one can tell you not to smoke, you\u2019ll need to move out and live alone, but good luck finding a place where smoking won\u2019t violate your lease. If that\u2019s not an option for you, have some class.

The fuck you sitting in your underwear on your moms couch smoking weed all day everyday for?", ">this is not something that I want to be judged on\n\nPeople are going to judge you regardless of your feelings about the matter. \n\n>asked me to not smoke on that day\n\nIt seems like this is your mom's place you live at, not yours, and she asked you to hold off for one day, which isn't at all an unreasonable request, especially since you don't seem to be contributing to the household in any way. \n\n>I don't think I did anything wrong\n\nYou disrespected your mom and her place by ignoring what she asked of you. You embarrassed yourself by setting an example that goes against your uncle's intentions for his children and making yourself look like all the worst stereotypes of stoners ever. \n\nYTA, OP. What you do when you're alone is your business, but you did get caught by children after being warned they were coming. Also, shifting blame for your behavior to your mom makes you a double AHish. \n\nAlso, how did you not hear the car arrive if you have the windows open? Getting high is one thing, but you don't seem to be a functioning adult. Your uncle is right.", "Listen man, I smoke, I know a lot of people that smoke. You have to learn how to be responsible with it and RESPECTFUL. \n\nSmoking is a personal choice. PERSONAL. Do it on your own time in your own space.

I\u2019m going to try and seriously address this as someone who uses cannabis medicinally. \n\nYou are not treating weed as \u201cnature\u2019s medicine\u201d. If you were, you\u2019d be treating it like medicine, with limits and quantities. With respect. \n\nYou share a house with a non smoker and yet you think it\u2019s appropriate to smoke inside the house. You even did so when you KNEW that children were coming over later. Even though it was an accident that they came over earlier, the secondhand smoke would 100% have been hanging around noticeably. If you don\u2019t think it smells afterwards, that\u2019s because you\u2019re desensitized. It is bad for kids\u2019 lungs. You should know this.\n\nHave respect for those who share the air with you. Consider buying an Airizer at the very least so you can vape that plant material instead of smoking. \n\nAnd also consider that it is habit forming, and at a certain point it does numb you out mentally. \n\nYTA.", "YTA.

I (19M) smoke weed all day, every day. It's just a normal  part of my routine and I don't see anything wrong with it, and this is not something that I want to be judged on. My mom is completely against me smoking weed, and she's always telling me to stop.  I believe that cannabis is nature's medicine and that society is  oppressive to those who use it. It has helped me in so many ways and it upsets me that it's still stigmatized.\n\nMy mom told me a few days ago that my uncle and younger cousins (4 and 6 years old) would be over around 3PM yesterday, and asked me to not smoke on that day. She always gets upset if she sees me smoking, so I didn't do it while she was home.  She went to the grocery store in the morning and I figured it would be okay to  blaze up in the living room with the windows open before my cousins showed up.\n\nWell as it turns out, my uncle and two cousins showed up early and walked in right as I was in the middle of smoking a joint and lounging on the couch in my underwear. It was a really embarrassing moment, and I'm sure my small cousins were shocked to see me like that. To make matters worse, they saw me coughing in a haze of smoke as they walked in. My uncle was upset and he screamed at me for smoking in front of the children and being \"irresponsible.\" He told me that I needed to grow up and start thinking  about the consequences of my actions. I could tell that he was really disappointed in me, and the whole situation made me really frustrated. \n\nI know this was not a good situation and I regret that my cousins had to see me like that. But here's the thing: I don't think I did anything wrong. My mom told me the wrong arrival time, so how was I supposed to know that my cousins would be coming over early? And I don't see what the big deal is about smoking weed in my own home, as long as I'm not bothering anyone. If I had been told the correct time, this would have been avoided.\n\n**TL;DR:  I smoked weed in my living room while my mom was at the grocery store and my uncle and young cousins showed up early.

But I also have severe pain and inflammation problems that weed helps with where other medications have failed. Or if the medications helped they caused horrible side effects like worsening my low blood pressure problems and causing me to faint more often, allergic responses, being so fogged out that I couldn't even understand English or wake up in time for work, severe lung inflammation that landed me in the ER - the list goes on and on. \n\nSmoking before I get up makes it so that getting up doesn't hurt so badly that I procrastinate getting up or have to sit back down every few minutes to work through the pain. It helps to reduce my muscle spasms so that my neck doesn't twitch and then lock up so that I have to go get steroids to unfuck me and let me turn my head again. It significantly reduces my chances of fainting when I stand up and when I shower because it helps to bring up my resting heart rate and blood pressure just enough that I'm mostly normal. When I smoke I get so much more done in a day because of the reduced pain and fainting. The lack of pain actually makes me less foggy than the weed makes me so I'm more mentally clear when I smoke than when I don't. \n\nThe caveat there is that I also don't smoke nearly as much as most people do. What lasts me an entire day is most stoners wake n bake. I smoke a little bit often throughout the day because the physical effects do wear off pretty quickly. I don't like being fogged out all the time though so I keep the hits small and regulate how often I smoke. I've been foggy for most of my life from my pain. I want to actually fucking function for once. And if I don't have the money for it, well that sucks. I don't always have the money for Drs appointments either - I figure it out and pay my damn bills.\n\nThat being said, I dated someone who would go through 6-7x as much as I did in a day and didn't see a problem with the fact that he was too vegged out to function and do basics in life. He would forget appointments constantly and if I didn't remember his schedule for him he'd miss appointments entirely and then blame me for it. He was late for work and often made me late for work because we shared a vehicle. I couldn't even try to save up for my own vehicle because I was dealing with ongoing health issues, covering for him missing bills he was supposed to be responsible for, or paying for maintenance on his vehicle. Plus I was young and got shit pay. \n\nHe wouldn't wash his dishes, or even move the stack from his desk to the sink. He\u2019d have tantrums if I asked him to take care of it because almost every single dish was sitting dirty on his desk, and then tell me I was nagging him. But then he'd bitch that there were no clean dishes to use and throw another tantrum when I refused to clean up after him **again.** He\u2019d go days without showering and not wash his clothes so he'd be wearing the same stank ass shit unless I washed it for him. Eventually I was the only one doing housework despite working as much or more than he did on top of having decreased energy due to my health issues. \n\nHe\u2019d smoke through the majority of the weed and leave none for me unless I hid mine so that I had it available for my pain days and be able to make it to work instead of being dead in bed from my pain. If I refused to give him mine because I actually use it as a medication whereas he smoked recreationally he would blow the months budget and be late on one of the bills he was responsible for. I'd suddenly have no phone service because he skipped a couple months payments on our phone bill to buy himself more weed or fast food despite having food at home. Then he'd blame me and tell me I was abusive for not sharing my weed. \n\nIf he didn't smoke he had what were quite frankly **psychotic** episodes. It's one of the major reasons he's my ex now. He\u2019d swerve at other vehicles on the road with me in the car and drive way beyond what was safe for the level of traffic or weather conditions. And I speed myself but goddamn he was **RECKLESS**. At least I slow down when I see that I'm catching up to traffic ahead and wait for safe space to pass people instead of tailgating and weaving between cars like a nutjob. \n\nHe\u2019d scream about every little thing when they were truly LITTLE issues. He broke electronics because he'd get mad that he lost at something. He screamed at me for hours during a long car trip once because a cop gave him a warning about one of his lights being out. When I ended things he went fully manic and is now still stalking and threatening to kill me. \n\nTL;DR - Saying that people can't be addicted to weed or that it can't be dangerous is fucking **bullshit.** But it's not about how often you smoke as much as it is how *much* you smoke along with your relationship to and dependence on it. It's just like any other substance issue.", "Yeah, probably about a 50% chance OP\u2019s name ends up getting used as a verb in the uncle\u2018s household. \n\n\u201cYou going to Rick your life up?\u201c \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Bro, he was my friend last school year but over the summer he totally Trevored.\u201d", "That and he said he was smoking a joint.
