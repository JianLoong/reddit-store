{"id": 6488, "submission_id": "103blj0", "title": "AITA for smoking weed in my living room on the day that my two younger cousins visited?", "selftext": "So here's the deal. I (19M) smoke weed all day, every day. It's just a normal  part of my routine and I don't see anything wrong with it, and this is not something that I want to be judged on. My mom is completely against me smoking weed, and she's always telling me to stop.  I believe that cannabis is nature's medicine and that society is  oppressive to those who use it. It has helped me in so many ways and it upsets me that it's still stigmatized.\n\nMy mom told me a few days ago that my uncle and younger cousins (4 and 6 years old) would be over around 3PM yesterday, and asked me to not smoke on that day. She always gets upset if she sees me smoking, so I didn't do it while she was home.  She went to the grocery store in the morning and I figured it would be okay to  blaze up in the living room with the windows open before my cousins showed up.\n\nWell as it turns out, my uncle and two cousins showed up early and walked in right as I was in the middle of smoking a joint and lounging on the couch in my underwear. It was a really embarrassing moment, and I'm sure my small cousins were shocked to see me like that. To make matters worse, they saw me coughing in a haze of smoke as they walked in. My uncle was upset and he screamed at me for smoking in front of the children and being \"irresponsible.\" He told me that I needed to grow up and start thinking  about the consequences of my actions. I could tell that he was really disappointed in me, and the whole situation made me really frustrated. \n\nI know this was not a good situation and I regret that my cousins had to see me like that. But here's the thing: I don't think I did anything wrong. My mom told me the wrong arrival time, so how was I supposed to know that my cousins would be coming over early? And I don't see what the big deal is about smoking weed in my own home, as long as I'm not bothering anyone. If I had been told the correct time, this would have been avoided.\n\n**TL;DR:  I smoked weed in my living room while my mom was at the grocery store and my uncle and young cousins showed up early. My mom gave me the wrong arrival time and I don't think I did anything wrong by smoking weed in my own home.**", "created_utc": 1672858430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103blj0/aita_for_smoking_weed_in_my_living_room_on_the/", "score": 245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA", "YTA on so many levels, but let's start w/ a couple of the most the most basic ones that I can't believe you don't know:\n1. Don't smoke weed inside the house and especially not a shared space. It isn't your house, your mom doesn't like it, and it reeks. It is overall very rude. If you want to smoke in the living room, get your own place or move in w/ like-minded pot-heads.\n\nNo matter what time your uncle shoed up, the livingroom would have reeked. \n\n2. Don't get high before a meeting up w/ people who don't want to deal w/ someone who is high. It is incredibly rude to make people deal w/ your stanky, red-eyed, un-focused, un-motivated high \n\nYour uncle didn't want to have to deal with you high and he didn't want his kids to deal with it either.\n\n3. Why are you sitting around in your Mom's living room.in your underwear? Cut that out. You are an adult, put some pants on.\n\nThere are so many other issues to deal with in this post, but honestly, if you don't understand basic pot etiquette and can't manage to put on pants, I don't think there is a point in going any further.", "Is there anything ethically wrong with smoking weed in your underwear? Absolutely not. If your mother asks you to not smoke weed (in what very much sounds like her home and not yours) that day, and not only do you smoke but you blaze up in the middle of the living room (which we both know would reek of weed even with windows open in that circumstance), then YTA. If it's not so cold that you can be in your underwear with the windows open you could've taken a walk.", "Whose living room was this, exactly? Kind of an essential part of the story. \n\nI feel like it's your mom's/parents' home. In that case: their house, their rules. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re 19, that means you\u2019re an adult. At least *try* to act like it.\n\nDo you pay rent?", "YTA. That is your mother\u2019s home and she has asked you to stop and asked you not to smoke in the house on the day she had guests over. \n\nAlso, you smoke weed all day every day? Do you do anything else? Do you have a job, or attend classes, or even help around the home? \n\nSounds like you have some major growing up to do. If you don\u2019t like her rules, move out. Simple as that.", "YTA.  19 years old, who sits around in his underwear all day smoking weed.  \nYour mom must be so proud.  /s \nGrow up and adult better", "YTA. Not your house, it's your MOM'S house and you're just living in it. She made a reasonable request: do not expose your underage cousins to smoke. It would not have been difficult to accommodate her request but you just couldn't set your desires aside long enough to help create a nontoxic space for the visiting children. \n\nIn what world are you anything other than a selfish, inconsiderate, toxic asshole?", "YTA.\n\nShe asked you not to and that company was coming.", "YTA.

I seriously doubt that it's *your* home. It's more than likely your mom's. And also, why the hell would you do it on *the day of, in the living room, in your underwear?* It's almost like you were *trying* to get caught. Not to mention the disrespect of not following your mom's rules. You've ruined your uncle and cousin's perspectives on you. Your mom warned you. You blew her off and did it anyway. You got caught, and you blamed her for it. You really need to grow up, dude.", "YTA.\n\nI'll make it nice for you and break it down a bit. \n\n1.\n\n\n>I (19M) smoke weed all day, every day.\n\nSo you do not do anything else?? No school?? No job?? Not even chores?? You laze around, your mother pays the bills, does all the chores and you do not even help her one bit. BUT THEN...\n\n2.\n\n>in my own home\n\nIt is not your home. You do not pay anything towards it and you do not even help out. It is your mothers home and she asked you not to smoke.\n\n3.\n\n>My mom told me the wrong arrival time, so how was I supposed to know that my cousins would be coming over early?\n\nNow you start blaming your mom. She might have told a different time but people can arrive early. She didn't even know that herself. But the time shouldn't matter. Why not, you might ask. Well...\n\n>asked me to not smoke on that day\n\nShe asked you not to smoke the entire day. Because even with windows open it smells. Because there might be ashes, or some smoke still clinging to the ceiling. Or people might come over earlier. And I doubt they were hours early, most likely 15 minutes?? Maybe 30. That would not have been enough time to let the smell out. She asked for a reason and you failed to listen. It's HER house, she sets the rules. Lastly:\n\n4.\n\n>as long as I'm not bothering anyone\n\nYou're clearly bothering your mother. And smoke damages paint and leaves stains. So smoke outside. But best, stop smoking. Because it might help as medicine in some cases, but I have not heard a single medical reason why you should smoke all day every day.\n\nYTA. Grow up. You behave emberrasingly for someone your age. Signed, someone not even a year older.", "YTA. Both for doing this and for smoking weed in your Mom's house when she's against it. Want to smoke weed all day? Then do it in your own apartment. Grow up, dude.", "YTA and I say this as someone who smokes weed all day everyday for medical reasons. When I lived with other people in their houses, I respected their wishes and smoked outside rain or shine. It is rude to put your choices on someone else, regardless of how you feel and how stigmatized you feel it is. Your mother made a very simple request and it\u2019s her house. It would not have been hard to comply but it sounds like what you really did was try to make a point and it backfired.", "YTA - not for smoking weed, but for doing it in a room that everyone uses. Why not stick to your bedroom?", "YTA. And it sounds like it\u2019s your mom\u2019s home, not yours. If you want to have full run of your living environment where no one can tell you not to smoke, you\u2019ll need to move out and live alone, but good luck finding a place where smoking won\u2019t violate your lease. If that\u2019s not an option for you, have some class. Also, if you are smoking all day everyday, you are dealing with an addiction/chemical dependency and should talk to your doctor about addressing the underlying cause.", "YTA your poor mom, move out.", "YTA. \n\nThe very least you could do is smoke outside.

Move out or do as you\u2019re asked at home. It seems like a really easy request to honor but you decided you didn\u2019t care and did it anyway.

The fuck you sitting in your underwear on your moms couch smoking weed all day everyday for?", ">this is not something that I want to be judged on\n\nPeople are going to judge you regardless of your feelings about the matter. \n\n>asked me to not smoke on that day\n\nIt seems like this is your mom's place you live at, not yours, and she asked you to hold off for one day, which isn't at all an unreasonable request, especially since you don't seem to be contributing to the household in any way. \n\n>I don't think I did anything wrong\n\nYou disrespected your mom and her place by ignoring what she asked of you. You embarrassed yourself by setting an example that goes against your uncle's intentions for his children and making yourself look like all the worst stereotypes of stoners ever. \n\nYTA, OP. What you do when you're alone is your business, but you did get caught by children after being warned they were coming. Also, shifting blame for your behavior to your mom makes you a double AHish. \n\nAlso, how did you not hear the car arrive if you have the windows open? Getting high is one thing, but you don't seem to be a functioning adult. Your uncle is right.", "Listen man, I smoke, I know a lot of people that smoke. You have to learn how to be responsible with it and RESPECTFUL. \n\nSmoking is a personal choice. PERSONAL. Do it on your own time in your own space. I know your family came a little early, but it didn\u2019t seem like a huge time gap.

The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. \n\nYTA", "OK. I\u2019m going to try and seriously address this as someone who uses cannabis medicinally. \n\nYou are not treating weed as \u201cnature\u2019s medicine\u201d. If you were, you\u2019d be treating it like medicine, with limits and quantities. With respect. \n\nYou share a house with a non smoker and yet you think it\u2019s appropriate to smoke inside the house. You even did so when you KNEW that children were coming over later. Even though it was an accident that they came over earlier, the secondhand smoke would 100% have been hanging around noticeably. If you don\u2019t think it smells afterwards, that\u2019s because you\u2019re desensitized. It is bad for kids\u2019 lungs. You should know this.\n\nHave respect for those who share the air with you. Consider buying an Airizer at the very least so you can vape that plant material instead of smoking. \n\nAnd also consider that it is habit forming, and at a certain point it does numb you out mentally. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. I smoke all day every day too. But I also don\u2019t smoke inside so the house is smelly for the people that don\u2019t smoke who live here because I\u2019m not inconsiderate.

I (19M) smoke weed all day, every day. It's just a normal  part of my routine and I don't see anything wrong with it, and this is not something that I want to be judged on. My mom is completely against me smoking weed, and she's always telling me to stop.  I believe that cannabis is nature's medicine and that society is  oppressive to those who use it. It has helped me in so many ways and it upsets me that it's still stigmatized.\n\nMy mom told me a few days ago that my uncle and younger cousins (4 and 6 years old) would be over around 3PM yesterday, and asked me to not smoke on that day. She always gets upset if she sees me smoking, so I didn't do it while she was home.  She went to the grocery store in the morning and I figured it would be okay to  blaze up in the living room with the windows open before my cousins showed up.\n\nWell as it turns out, my uncle and two cousins showed up early and walked in right as I was in the middle of smoking a joint and lounging on the couch in my underwear. It was a really embarrassing moment, and I'm sure my small cousins were shocked to see me like that. To make matters worse, they saw me coughing in a haze of smoke as they walked in. My uncle was upset and he screamed at me for smoking in front of the children and being \"irresponsible.\" He told me that I needed to grow up and start thinking  about the consequences of my actions. I could tell that he was really disappointed in me, and the whole situation made me really frustrated. \n\nI know this was not a good situation and I regret that my cousins had to see me like that. But here's the thing: I don't think I did anything wrong. My mom told me the wrong arrival time, so how was I supposed to know that my cousins would be coming over early? And I don't see what the big deal is about smoking weed in my own home, as long as I'm not bothering anyone. If I had been told the correct time, this would have been avoided.\n\n**TL;DR:  I smoked weed in my living room while my mom was at the grocery store and my uncle and young cousins showed up early.
