I firmly believe this to be a real disorder and it is medically recognized as such. If you intend on using this post to debate the realness of the disorder itself or my friends diagnosis, you can show yourself out the door.\n\nMy friend and I have been friends for about a decade. They were diagnosed with DID 5 years ago and when they told me, I did my best to support them however I could.  Learning about the disorder, doing my best to remember all their different alters, etc. I did as best as I could to do what they asked of me. \n\nMore recently, about a week ago, an alter \n frontedwhile we were chatting. I noticed a switch in the way they were acting, and asked who I was speaking to (in an attempt to be polite). They said \"It's (OP's name)!\" I thought it a funny coincidence that one of their alters and I shared a name and I brushed it off, continuing our conversation. However the longer we talked, the more I realized it seemed like they were mimicing me. I'm not from where we currently live, so our accents are VERY different. However, this alter had what seemed to be an attempt at my accent. Not a good attempt, mind you, but an attempt. They started mimicing physical quirks I have (I have ADHD and tend to fidget a lot because I have a hard time keeping still. I have very specific things I do to move without physically walking around). Eventually I asked them things about themself and everything they said about themself was things about me. I excused myself early and went home.\n\nLater I called them and asked who was fronting, and it was another alter I was already familiar with. I asked about the alter I had met earlier, and they admitted that, yes, an alter had formed based around me. I believe they used the word \"introject\" or something similar. I expressed my discomfort with that, and told them that it was extremely unfair to me for them to be basically stealing my identity.  They yelled and said that it was unfair to them and their system when they couldn't help it. They said I was invalidating their mental disorder and that if I was really their friend I'd be happy for them.\n\nI don't know how to feel about it honestly. I do support them, but that alter is LITERALLY me in every sense except for the body. They dress like me, act like me, talk like me, have my exact interests and everything.  With our mutual friends, if someone tries to tell ME something while alter-me is fronting, the alter gets upset that they don't get to know too because \"we're the same person so we should be getting all the same treatment!\" I've said, multiple times, that they are not actually me, but every time they just get upset and claim I'm invalidating them. So, am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: As therapy is coming up a lot already, my friend refuses to seek therapy for DID.\n\nEdit 2: Cost (we're in America) and Location are some factors in why they won't seek therapy, according to them.", "created_utc": 1667174854, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhuvqv/aita_for_invalidating_my_friends_mental_disorder/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'll definitely look into that!", "But from OP's perspective, it would be. Yes, their friend is not in control of what introject enters their system, but OP is entitled to their individuality. If the alter acknowledged they were another entity, then yes, I would agree with you. But the situation OP has found themself in is unfair - a person that is meant to be their friend is trying to take over their life and refuses to acknowledge the impact it is having on them. That is \"unfair\", because it is robbing OP of their identity, who they are, and is refusing to let them have a voice on the subject.\n\nThe existence of the introject is not what is unfair, it is the way they are behaving that is.\n\nEdit: To make it absolutely clear - the reason it is unfair is because, as you have acknowledged, this behaviour is incredibly harmful, but OP's friend is acting as if it is completely justified because they have DID, and thus, OP needs to accept it. That is the definition of unfair because it is prioritising this person's mental health over OP's", "OP also said they said these things once they found out about the introject existing - not after all of the other stuff happened. Saying someone\u2019s existence is \u201cunfair\u201d just after you\u2019ve figured it out is wrong.", "I understand where you're coming from, and you're right, I did not understand that timeline correctly. OP did jump to conclusions, and whilst those assumptions they made did end up being correct, they were premature and not typical of people with DID"]}
