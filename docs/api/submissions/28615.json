I try to do this as discretely as possible and I cover it with my shirt because it's really embarrassing for me, and once I stand up I refasten it.\n\nSo this is one of those things that isn't really justifiable in public. Especially when actually men go around flashing people in public. Sure, you've put on some weight and are a little uncomfortable, there's absolutely no way for her or anyone else to come to that assumption first. The first thing anyone is going to think if they see you do that is you're doing something pervy and your explanation isn't going to help because they'll assume you have some kind of cover story to try and keep from being arrested. \n\nInvest in some elastic waistbands. \n\nYTA", "YTA. This is strange behaviour which understandably made people uncomfortable. Seriously, buy some clothes which mean you can sit without bursting out of them, you can probably do so for the price of the meal you were called out at.", "YTA. I get wanting to be comfortable, and I could even excuse unbuttoning a top button, but partially unzipping in public is inappropriate. It's not surprising she thought you were a pervert, and then you yelled at her when she called you out. Be an adult and buy some pants that fit ffs.", "YTA, and I say this as someone who's partner has a medical condition which,  due to pressure on his lower abdomen, means he has to do similar things with his trousers when he sits/stands. Undoing your trousers in plain sight in public is likely to draw attention and it is reasonable to think of it strange and possible dangerous behaviour. It is your responsibility to take care of your physical needs, that are not life threatening, in a way that doesn't make others feel uncomfortable, go somewhere private to undo/redo your trousers.", "YTA\n\nInvest in some new pants and alterations for some of your existing pants. Use the rubber band trick to get an extra couple of inches in your waistband \n\nHit the gym. Adjust your diet.\n\nDo NOT unbutton your pants & lower your zipper in public. That luxury is reserved for your home.", "YTA\n\nI understand a combination of embarrassment and frugality in not buying new clothes, but fully unbuttoning your pants and partially unzipping is crude behavior and I don't think it's shocking that someone was appalled by it. You reference a few times how discreet you are about it, but I think you're somewhat missing the point. People can clearly tell you're undoing your pants to a degree and simply flashing your goods out isn't the only concern, you could be....enjoying yourself. You gotta get new clothes.", "YTA. Get new pants that fit. Don\u2019t undo your pants in public establishments like that.", "Get some better fitting clothes.", "YTA. You set yourself up for this by your behavior. There are lots more pervy guys out there than guys who gained just enough weight to be able to wear their pants but have to unbutton and unzip to be comfortable. I really can't blame her.", "YTA that\u2019s indecent behavior, your intention is irrelevant. It\u2019s the action that matters. It would be different if you were at home in a private setting but doing that in public is completely inappropriate, I agree with the woman and understand why she felt the way she did. You lack social awareness", "YTA. Buy some new clothes and stop rationalizing crude behavior.", "I too would lose my shit in public if someone was unbuttoning and unzipping themselves.\n\nYTA. Buy bigger pants until you lose the weight.\n\nETA: Your girlfriend sucks too, though I wish you did get management involved so that they could kick your butt out and ban you.

I don\u2019t think yta, in fact I\u2019ve done the same thing but I\u2019m a girl.  It\u2019s awful to be accused of something you wouldn\u2019t do, and then to not have your side heard.  This was clearly a paranoid mother, but she pushed you to have that reaction so it\u2019s not your fault but yelling in public could always be avoided somehow", "Op, buy some button extenders until you loose a little weight.

It\u2019s really that simple.", "I don't necessarily want to say YTA here but I also can't say NTA. Whatever your intentions may have been, the fact is that you were undoing your pants and undoing your fly in the middle of public. Honestly, I have some jeans like that too and it's fine if I'm at home. I will totally do that while I'm sitting on the couch or just take my jeans off. But not in public. Even if you just go buy a pair of really cheap sweatpants from your nearest salvation army or Goodwill store. But reaching down and unzipping your pants in the middle public is definitely going to get the wrong kind of attention and assumptions no matter why you were doing it. So before you end up getting arrested with an indecent exposure sentence, I highly suggest you buy a couple pairs of pants", "Ew what in the hell?

Like I'm aware of how it might look and the potential implications so I pull up my pants as I sit and unbutton it so that only my belly is showing but my shirt is over it anyway so I'm not actually reaching down there or anything like that, I'm literally just loosening it but I'm doing so in a way that is respectable if that makes sense this is genuinely the first time this has happened to me out in public which is why I was taken aback because I usually just sit down and then eat my meal.", "If he can afford to eat at a restaurant, then he can afford pants.", "Knowing something is weird and taking steps to mitigate/conceal it is fine IF it is something you have no control over. This is easily bypassed by getting clothes that fit. \n\nYTA, make an effort.", "100% YTA. Just go buy some clothes that actually fit you.", "Use a rubber band to connect the button to the hole. Use one the same color as pants and then there is no fastening/ unfastening. It was what I did while early pregnant and works really well. You loop in through the hole and then connect both ends to the button. You want a rubber band that is somewhat thick and is barely taught when standing (so it doesn't come undone) and will stretch while sitting. Honestly a hair tie works well for this too."]}
