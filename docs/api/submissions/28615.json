Sure, you've put on some weight and are a little uncomfortable, there's absolutely no way for her or anyone else to come to that assumption first.

It may look weird, but everyone will just feel sorry that he had ill fitting pants instead of thinking he's a creep for unzipping.", "Ok yeah thats pretty fair, i\u2019d drop that friendship too", "Yeah I can totally see how someone would freak out if they saw something that looked like that. I would be so uncomfortable. I'm too much of a coward to say anything but like. Would really sour my evening.", "I think  since he opens  the button  and part of the Zipper  to sit when he moves the Zipper  will probably  open even more through  the movement.  But yes it's better  even though  the best  is to go buy some pants  that fit him", "Maybe.  Then grip the side of the waist of his pants with us shirt over it to prevent that on the short walk back to the table.  Less inappropriate than unzipping."]}
