The wife stating that she\u2019s always wanted to experience feeling the kicking and moving baby. \n\nNow for context she can fully have children of her own this surrogacy is a choice they made so as not to interfere with her career by being pregnant.

(She\u2019s a personal trainer) They have been constantly asking me to touch my stomach and I always politely decline as it is uncomfortable for me. \n\nWell while me and wife were at a baby appointment last week she reached over and rubbed my stomach while talking to the doctor. I kindly asked her to stop touching my stomach and she snapped at me and said I was ruining the experience for her and it\u2019s her baby she should be able to feel her kick.

Even if it's her child she doesn't have tht right to touch you without your consent or permission and she needs to back off. Tell them they are renting your uterus for the baby, not your stomach to rub and touch inappropriately and make you feel uncomfortable and violated.\n\nI'd practice arm distance with her. Always stay three to four steps away from them so they can't physically touch you. Don't sit next to her and stay out of arms reach from now on whenever possible. If it's not possible, deliberately use your body to point your stomach away from her and her husband.\n\nBeing pregnant and feeling babies kicks is an experience she took away from herself. You're not obligated to let her use your body in that manner.\n\nYou should have a calm discussion and explain to them that you don't like others touching your stomach. That is a very intimate activity and makes you uncomfortable, esp when it's done without permission or consent. You want to be comfortable in your pregnancy and grow a healthy baby. Tell them they are NOT entitled to touch your stomach and to not do it again.\n\n If they can't respect that, you can ask that they wait in the waiting room during your appointments with your doctor. You have that right, even as a surrogate. They don't have to be there with you in the room with access to violate your body autonomy. They need to read up on laws of consent. You have every right to not let others touch your private body parts, and they need to respect that. They will have the rest of their lives to bond with their baby when it's born.", "NTA. Consent is cool.", "Nta,\nYour body your choice.", "NTA, your body your choice. My petty self would reach out to touch her belly every time she did it or say no sternly so others would look/judge her in public.", "Nta it is your body first and foremost", "Baby's in YOUR body. Them touching you is a horrible violation of you as a person. You're NOT an incubator they get to put their freasy fingers on!\nNTA at all", "NTA I would not want anyone touching me either. That is your personal area not theirs.", "I have doubts that they\u2019re both phoning you and calling you an AH. You\u2019re doing them a solid favour that most women wouldn\u2019t even contemplate. Contract or not, it\u2019s your body and contract or not, it\u2019s your baby till you hand it over.", "Exactly this. It is HER body. Not the soon to be mom\u2019s body.

Always a shame when a baby messes up your plans\u2026", "We do have a contract and no where in there does it state she can touch my stomach. There are things such as dietary changes I\u2019ve made and her coming to the appointments with me. She never even brought it up until around month 4 and I told them then that while I was carrying their baby I was not comfortable with people touching my stomach.

I suppose it does something for the biological parents, but their wants do not trump the surrogate's control over her own body.  If they want to bond they could record themselves reading or singing to the baby and ask the surrogate to play the recordings, as fetuses can hear while in the womb.", "It's bonding for the mom's cause you know the baby's there. But it's also their own body and lots of biochemical changes take place during pregnancy to ensure the survival of the baby.", "There is no huge favor...she is probably getting paid alot", "I don't think it qualifies as a favor if you get paid for it", "No we do have a contract and the wife goes with me to all appointments regarding the baby and will be in the delivery room. The husband however will not be in the delivery room as per his request", "I think so too. She can certainly can limit touching, like once per appointment or something. And the wife was 100% out of line, for a billion reasons. But it's kind of ridiculous to expect that the parents of the baby not feel any kicks AT ALL. Yes, it's your body so you can say no to touching but you need to give a little since it's their baby.", "This is my first surrogacy. Also no matching as we didn\u2019t use a company they are family friends of mine I\u2019ve known for years", "Just curious why you are saying this?", "I\u2019m curious why you think it isn\u2019t.", "Bodily autonomy exists. The default should always be to ask someone before touching them. This woman touched op without her consent and then verbally attacked her for saying no. Op is definitely not the asshole", "She knew this as she was around when I was pregnant with my own daughter since they are family friends. There was never even a conversation about it before around the 4 month mark of my pregnancy when I started really showing", "If she thought it was such a big deal to be able to touch the surrogate stomach then should have asked about. Otherwise its up to the surrogate for its their belly.\n\nAs you said she is not the last woman on earth with a womb so they should have screened for that if they want that experience.", "They are long time family friends I\u2019ve known for years.

It\u2019s an active job, which in itself isn\u2019t problematic regarding a healthy pregnancy (which we assume she could have)\n\nHer using a surrogate, is only because she wants to keep her \u201cperfect\u201d body. \n\nYou are NTA, your body your rules.", "Info: did you make it clear that they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to touch your stomach ever prior to agreeing to surrogacy?", "I just want you to know, as a midwife (U.K. equivalent of a US labour and delivery nurse) that if you change your mind, no contract in the world will stop your medical team from kicking her out of your room if she misbehaves. We deal with unpleasant family members all the time, she\u2019ll be treated no differently. All you need to do is say the word if you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable.", "LOL! Talk about a totally unenforceable contract.", "OP are you US, UK, Europe? Cause they all have VERY different laws, but I'm pretty sure your medical rights overrule any of the contracts you have made. Especially in labour.", "I think knowing them helps your case to say you are happy to help them in this situation and you recognize the financial benefits you\u2019re receiving from the arrangement, but that you just really hate being touched. \n\nI personally don\u2019t care about belly rubs when I\u2019m pregnant(from family and friends), so I have to check myself when close friends and family are pregnant. It sounds like this woman is similar and also just disrespectful a little by continually trying and ignoring your requests. NTA - but try to not let yourself dwell on it, it isn\u2019t worth you stressing over when you have so much going on already.", "That's not entirely true, babies can feel your touch while in the womb. I'm currently pregnant and my midwives told me that if you rub your stomach a lot those babies tend to be better soothed by rubbing their backs. Same with patting or swaying, whatever you do to the belly the babies show a preference for after birth.\n\nThis is absolutely not an excuse for the mother's actions! OP is firmly NTA, just wanted to share this fun fact.", "It absolutely is a favor. Carrying someone\u2019s else\u2019s child in your body is a favor, regardless of payment.", "It's still a favor. Pregnancy and birth do serious damage to the vaginal area and your body's core. It's a huge favor to put yourself through that for someone else. The pay is a reflection of the fact you're at work 24/7 for nine months straight and a compensation for the damage and changes the pregnancy does to a women's body.", "Is it possible for her to wait outside the room and then come ask the doctor questions once you have been examined? It could fulfill the terms of the contract without putting her in touching distance. You could even give the office a heads up about her boundary crossing ways.\n\nI had to edit because I forgot my vote. NTA", "She's not an incubator she is an actual human with thoughts, feelings and rights, you are aware of this right?", "If she wanted to feel the kicks she had every opportunity to carry the child herself \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It\u2019s a post that is a clearly Karma farming post where no one will consider her the asshole.\n\nThe mother is framed as selfish, she can have a baby (first if you haven\u2019t had a baby you don\u2019t know if you can have a baby so at best the person doesn\u2019t know if they are fertile), the reason for the surrogacy is career based as a personal trainer.  Goal here is to make the person look shallow for putting looks over pregnancy.\n\nSurrogacy is expensive and personal training doesn\u2019t pay that well.  So this means if they are a well off family able to afford surrogacy then the husband as a well paying job and then her concern over taking time off from her career for a year seems suspext.\n\nSo the combination of 24yr old Lesbian surrogate being a surrogate for a wealthy person who can have a baby but chooses not to because she is concerned for her career is unlikely to be true.", "I honestly didn\u2019t think I had to since they were around for my pregnancy with my daughter and knew then that I was uncomfortable with people touching my stomach", "You don't have to have a contract to not be touched.", "Sorry, I should have been clearer.  It does nothing to bond the baby to their biological mom rather than to the surrogate.", "It's always a VOLUNTARY sign-up. She's totally NTA for not allowing them to touch her belly if she's uncomfortable, but to put it as s favor is wrong: \n1. When she entered it knowing what she will get into (she's already had a kid) \n2. Probably getting paid/compensated for it", "To clear some things up her husband does have a well paying job. She doesn\u2019t want to take time off her career and also doesn\u2019t want to potentially hurt the baby while pregnant. Both are perfectly understandable reasons that I don\u2019t judge. Also I\u2019m not a lesbian and have no idea where that even came from lol. These are family friends I\u2019ve known for years. They wanted a baby and I enjoyed being pregnant with my first so I agreed to do this for them because I honestly need the money right now as I have a 3 year old of my own and am trying to go back to school", "This feels like you are reaching real hard", "Maybe not the norm but there are plenty of six figure+ personal trainers out in the world", "Tell them to bond with baby by talking to it. But while it is in YOUR body, hands off.\n\nHonestly I wouldn't have been a surrogate for someone who physically is able to have kids. Her wanting to preserve her figure is selfish.", "Understood then I\u2019m going to say ESH because I think you should have communicated that explicitly. Both parties failed to communicate in that regard. You assumed they\u2019d know your limit and they assumed they\u2019d be exempt as it\u2019s a fairly normal expectation the parents would have BUT once you made it clear that it was a hard boundary for you they needed to respect that and deal with their disappointment privately.", "Obviously, I was just curious as to whether or not she included it since it\u2019s such a firm boundary for OP and May have influenced their decision to choose another surrogate.", "Oh I see what you mean! Yeah I doubt baby can tell the difference between who is touching them. I definitely like your suggestions of recording voices to play for baby.", "She\u2019s not six figures but she does have quite a few clients. Also the husband has a well paying job and has made a name for himself in my community", "OP literally stated that she has known this family for awhile and WHILE she was pregnant with her own daughter (and they knew then that she did not want her belly touched). Now, why would this change? It is NOT OP's obligation to inform them on something they already know. And since they already knew that OP was uncomfortable with being touched on the stomach, THEY should have thought about that before using her as a surrogate. THEY should have initiated that conversation and boundary.\n\nedit to include: NTA, duh."]}
