Always stay three to four steps away from them so they can't physically touch you. Don't sit next to her and stay out of arms reach from now on whenever possible. If it's not possible, deliberately use your body to point your stomach away from her and her husband.\n\nBeing pregnant and feeling babies kicks is an experience she took away from herself. You're not obligated to let her use your body in that manner.\n\nYou should have a calm discussion and explain to them that you don't like others touching your stomach. That is a very intimate activity and makes you uncomfortable, esp when it's done without permission or consent. You want to be comfortable in your pregnancy and grow a healthy baby. Tell them they are NOT entitled to touch your stomach and to not do it again.\n\n If they can't respect that, you can ask that they wait in the waiting room during your appointments with your doctor. You have that right, even as a surrogate. They don't have to be there with you in the room with access to violate your body autonomy. They need to read up on laws of consent.

I'm currently pregnant and my midwives told me that if you rub your stomach a lot those babies tend to be better soothed by rubbing their backs. Same with patting or swaying, whatever you do to the belly the babies show a preference for after birth.\n\nThis is absolutely not an excuse for the mother's actions! OP is firmly NTA, just wanted to share this fun fact.", "It absolutely is a favor. Carrying someone\u2019s else\u2019s child in your body is a favor, regardless of payment.", "It's still a favor. Pregnancy and birth do serious damage to the vaginal area and your body's core. It's a huge favor to put yourself through that for someone else. The pay is a reflection of the fact you're at work 24/7 for nine months straight and a compensation for the damage and changes the pregnancy does to a women's body.", "Is it possible for her to wait outside the room and then come ask the doctor questions once you have been examined? It could fulfill the terms of the contract without putting her in touching distance. You could even give the office a heads up about her boundary crossing ways.\n\nI had to edit because I forgot my vote.

Goal here is to make the person look shallow for putting looks over pregnancy.\n\nSurrogacy is expensive and personal training doesn\u2019t pay that well.  So this means if they are a well off family able to afford surrogacy then the husband as a well paying job and then her concern over taking time off from her career for a year seems suspext.\n\nSo the combination of 24yr old Lesbian surrogate being a surrogate for a wealthy person who can have a baby but chooses not to because she is concerned for her career is unlikely to be true.", "I honestly didn\u2019t think I had to since they were around for my pregnancy with my daughter and knew then that I was uncomfortable with people touching my stomach", "You don't have to have a contract to not be touched.", "Sorry, I should have been clearer.  It does nothing to bond the baby to their biological mom rather than to the surrogate.", "It's always a VOLUNTARY sign-up. She's totally NTA for not allowing them to touch her belly if she's uncomfortable, but to put it as s favor is wrong: \n1. When she entered it knowing what she will get into (she's already had a kid) \n2. Probably getting paid/compensated for it", "To clear some things up her husband does have a well paying job. She doesn\u2019t want to take time off her career and also doesn\u2019t want to potentially hurt the baby while pregnant. Both are perfectly understandable reasons that I don\u2019t judge. Also I\u2019m not a lesbian and have no idea where that even came from lol. These are family friends I\u2019ve known for years.

Her wanting to preserve her figure is selfish.", "Understood then I\u2019m going to say ESH because I think you should have communicated that explicitly. Both parties failed to communicate in that regard. You assumed they\u2019d know your limit and they assumed they\u2019d be exempt as it\u2019s a fairly normal expectation the parents would have BUT once you made it clear that it was a hard boundary for you they needed to respect that and deal with their disappointment privately.", "Obviously, I was just curious as to whether or not she included it since it\u2019s such a firm boundary for OP and May have influenced their decision to choose another surrogate.", "Oh I see what you mean! Yeah I doubt baby can tell the difference between who is touching them. I definitely like your suggestions of recording voices to play for baby.", "She\u2019s not six figures but she does have quite a few clients. Also the husband has a well paying job and has made a name for himself in my community", "OP literally stated that she has known this family for awhile and WHILE she was pregnant with her own daughter (and they knew then that she did not want her belly touched). Now, why would this change? It is NOT OP's obligation to inform them on something they already know.

Those choices have consequences however and one of them being not able to feel the kicking unless the surrogate approves it.

Also, make sure you have an attorney to ensure any payments they owe you are made before they take the baby home from the hospital.", "NTA Your body...your choice. But if you're in the U.S. nobody understands that anymore.", "NTA. This is a perfect example of why surrogacy is kind of gross and exploitative to me. I know for many people there is no other way to have biological kids, but there are countless children in need of adoption out there. I feel like surrogacy is just one more way for rich people to exploit and use the poor for their own selfish purposes.", "NTA\n\nYou still have agency over your own body.

But also, I find it to be strange to become a surrogate and know you\u2019re not comfortable with the parents touching your stomach. \n\nWhat you\u2019re doing is very admirable but I feel like it would be expected that they would want to rub your stomach and would\u2019ve been a reason to talk to them about it before going through with it and potentially turn it down.\n\nEdit to add: they also probably thought they would be avoiding this exact situation since they\u2019re long time family friends.", "NAH There\u2019s nothing wrong with them wanting to experience feeling the baby kick as this is their child. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with you not wanting to be touched. But your attitude is obnoxious.

You're NTA for not wanting to be touched.\n\nI've seen some snide comments about how if she's able bodied but using a surrogate, it's because she wants a perfect figure, among other shallow assumptions. Pregnancy is a huge deal. For some it goes smoothly, but in general it can absolutely ravage your body. All manner of complications that you don't typically hear about can happen.

And OP is callous and unreasonable.", "NTA - but you\u2019re being petty and vindictive for chastising the mother for choosing surrogacy when she is supposedly capable of carrying a pregnancy - that has nothing to do with the issue of her touching your stomach when you don\u2019t want her to. The couple chose surrogacy and you agreed to do it for pay, stop judging her and being mean about it. The reason for surrogacy is irrelevant here. And honestly, you sound like you are harboring ill will or resentment against the couple because of your comment that the wife is capable of carrying a pregnancy. \n\nIt is totally understandable that the mother would want to feel the baby move/kick.  It is also understandable that you may not want people touching your stomach. Because this is a paid arrangement and there is no other way for the mother to feel the baby move/kick, I would allow her to touch your stomach to feel that movement - just once, and for like a minute max. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re pregnant with your own baby and you have agreed to give it to the couple for adoption. It\u2019s their baby you are carrying.", "NTA.  It's your body. Just because you're carrying their baby, it doesn't mean they own your body and can touch you whenever you want.  You set a boundary and she violated it. I'm a mom and when I was pregnant, I didn't want anyone touching me.", "NTA - what hypocrisy; she is using a surrogate because of her desire for bodily autonomy and yelling at you for exercising your own. They paid for you to live a healthy lifestyle while carrying and providing them with their child, not to grope you.", "EHS, obvi you get to decide who touches your body where when why and how and her breaking that boundary is unacceptable no question. You're also in an impossible situation no matter how ironclad your contract is because no one really wins. She's leased your body and its abilities and trusted you with her child, and you agreed to that. You both want your cake and to eat it to, and it sounds like you're both disappointed. I hope it's a safe delivery of a healthy baby so you can cut ties with the family you've become enmeshed in.", "First, I was inclined to think E S H for not navigating this issue before proceeding with the surrogacy. I can absolutely understand a couple who'd engaged a surrogate, regardless their reasoning, expecting that they would be able to feel the baby's movements and bond with it in that way. That should have been explicit from the outset. \n\nBut, that's a secondary issue to her touching you without your consent. So, I'm saying you're NTA. But you should make certain they can't make your life dramatically worse if they decide to become irrational or vindictive. \n\nWhen you combine pregnancy with bureaucracy and contracts, you create the potential for someone to use that bureaucracy as a weapon.", "NTA - your body, you get to decide who touches you. If she wants to feel her baby move and she has no health problems/issues preventing this, she should get pregnant herself.", "NTA.  I might feel differently if she had never born her own children but since she has she knows how it feels.  Pregnant women are not puppies to pet.

Sure you are being compensated but you still have authority over your body. You rented a womb, not the whole body.", "I understand her wanting to feel kicks and stuff but ultimately it's your body.

She is touching YOUR flesh and you don\u2019t have to like it.", "YTA for not mentioning this during the arrangements.\n\nYeah, for those downvoting, this is literally part of most questionnaires for surrogates (comfort levels with feeling baby kick etc) at least in Canada. It\u2019s considered a shared experience in which the autonomy of the person carrying the child comes first. So these questions are asked. And answered. Proactively.", "NTA It\u2019s your body, your rules. Touching you is not bonding with the baby, or for the baby. They can bond when it\u2019s born\u2014and they will.

I would think a pregnant personal trainer would be in great demand for training other pregnant women how to exercise safely and productively. NTA.", "Only problem I see is whether she made them aware before they signed the contract of surrogacy. If they were aware and still went with it, then it's on them, if she just surprised them with this revelation and robbed them of an important experience, then it's on her. So, INFO", "Right?  They\u2019re not bonding with the baby by rubbing your stomach - they can actually bond once baby makes it\u2019s grand entrance.", "But.... Their entire contract is a discussion of OP's consent? They obviously consented to getting pregnant, going to appointments with mom, and it sounds like dietary changes as well. Those had to be discussed to even draft the contract, why not discuss physical contact boundaries then too?\n\nI don't disagree with your statement on consent at all but it sounds like with surrogacy these things need to discussed A LOT before anyone signs anything. When you are selling your body's abilities as a service, in any sense, you need to come to the table with full transparency and established boundaries, or it's not informed consent for anyone involved. It sounds like they didn't talk about this aspect of the pregnancy AT ALL before deciding to create this life together.\n\n Obvi Mom is the bigger asshole for crossing op's boundaries and touching her against her will. I just have to wonder if any of these adults did have any sense or foresight and discussed it beforehand, would this be a deal breaker for the parents, had they been informed? Bodily autonomy is a far higher importance than financial, but by mixing the two I just don't think it's as cut and dry.", "Yeah I agree a little.\n\nLike on one hand, NTA to not want to be touched. It is still her body and she still has complete autonomy. No means no. And the future mother is an asshole for pushing the matter after OP already said no multiple times.\n\nBut on the other hand, it is odd to me that she'd even want to be a surrogate, knowing this bothers her this much. Not wanting complete strangers to touch her belly I understand, but obviously the parents would want to feel the baby kick, etc. I'm sure for them it's very meaningful. But oh well, I guess that's something for them to keep in mind if they have another kid via surrogacy.", "The service is not the experience of pregnancy, it\u2019s the baby.

This isn't a revelation - they've made an assumption. Bluntly, the OP has signed up to carry a child - not to give the family any kind of 'experience'.  \n\n\nETA The family have hired a surrogate in order to avoid the inconvenience of the mother carrying the child herself.

Crossing boundaries and disregarding bodily autonomy perfectly justifies the reply lacking in tact.", "You would think.", "The family is obviously TA here/OP is NTA but physical fitness has very little to do with pregnancy recovery.

Dietary changes and doctors visits are more than just \"carrying the baby\", they obviously have an expectation for how the pregnancy would go outside of \"birth a baby for me\". There was ample time to discuss this and in the same way mom and dad assumed it would be okay, OP assumed they paid enough attention to her other pregnancy to already know.

In this scenario of what actually happened, the mother is firmly TA, and what OP said is harsh but _necessary_ in that there\u2019s no tact needed from her in how she sets boundaries. Either way she\u2019d have a right to her own body and to set boundaries on it\u2014 but in the case of someone being infertile I would hope that OP or anyone would have enough tact and common sense not to tell the person \u201cwell you should\u2019ve gotten pregnant then\u201d to set those boundaries.\n\nThis all said though, in my theoretical scenario, if someone is at the point in grappling with their infertility that they still cannot fully reconcile it and handle it, they should probably work through that _before_ settling on surrogacy as an option because I\u2019d think that someone who is still grieving that inability might be more likely to try to \u201clive vicariously\u201d through a surrogate\u2019s pregnancy by refusing to allow boundaries to be set by the surrogate.", "their baby is literally about to fly out of her vagina but a belly rub is off the table, make it make sense", "My first and second kid I went right back to the same body. My third gave me a pooch. And less of a will or time to work out. But it certainly didn\u2019t trash it. I actually look darn good. Genetics could play a part in that, my mom had 7 kids and looked great. \n\nStill, it is a very annoying stereotype", "As someone who has been pregnant, it can have a tremendous toll on your body. It\u2019s equally unhealthy to pretend being pregnant and giving birth can\u2019t result in major changes in your body. Some pregnant peoples bodies never fully recover and others have lifetime of medical issues after.", "Kayla Itsines.  She's pregnant again and killing it in the PT department still.", "Which means nothing legally.", "otoh \"don't touch me\" is 100% something OP gets to say and nobody gets to argue", "Also, as someone who had a healthy pregnancy, but suffered with hyperemesis, not all women with a healthy pregnancy can continue with their everyday activities. Same goes for those who develop back pain and mobility issues from baby sitting on nerves etc. There are numerous issues that happen during pregnancy that don't necessarily make the pregnancy high risk or overly complicated, but can absolutely impact your life and your daily activities.\n\nIt's wonderful that many women can continue as normal while pregnant, but it is absolutely not a guarantee that one will be able to. Being sick 24/7 or having back spasms or chronic migraines that can't be treated properly til you give birth are sometimes just a natural consequence of pregnancy that some unfortunate women do experience, and you don't know if you will be one of those women prior to getting pregnant. And these things can be extremely debilitating despite every effort to continue as normal.\n\nLike you, I dont think it's purely about the \"perfect body\"... getting pregnant is a gamble when it comes to how your body and life will be impacted. The morality of whether one should choose surrogacy to overcome that is a whole separate issue, but I think it's a bit more nuanced than saying \"women are more than able to do x, y and z while pregnant, and therefore she clearly only wants to keep her perfect body\".", "OP said they didn\u2019t make it known until she was 4 months pregnant and she immediately told them it would make her uncomfortable", "Then they should not have tried to touch", "A judge would absolutely consider the medical team's decision to remove someone from the room.

I think I'll take their word over an internet stranger but thanks.", "So what? \n\nThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that the majority of surrogates are not paid a lot to be surrogates.", "This isn\u2019t a \u201cjob\u201d. This is a woman risking her own bodily health to carry a child that isn\u2019t hers. The fact that she\u2019s getting paid doesn\u2019t take away that fact. Carrying the child to the mother can continue her career is a favor, no matter if there\u2019s payment or not. That doesn\u2019t take away from my original point.", "I had a suspicion it was that too. But if we are leaving the story as is and just changing the infertility angle, it would still make OP NTA imo. For a simple reason that the woman would have been pushy and entitled in her demand and her behaviour as the mother to be is in this story, then OP snapping back wouldn't have been out of bounds set by the interaction.\n\nNow of course, if the mother was very kind and polite in her inquiry, OPs retort have been unreasonable and an AH response. But that's changing a lot and a whole different story.", "That is 100% what I meant thank you \ud83d\ude05 I am running on like two hours of sleep today so my ability to be coherent that\u2019s not great on a good day is a bit shot lol", " No, pain does not grant a pass to hurt others. Sometimes someone needs to learn a lesson so they don\u2019t repeat their mistake and hurt more people.", "Look I got where you were going with it and I do see your point. I still think OP would have been a NTA in that scenario because surrogacy on its own is a practice with murky connotations in most cases (with few exceptions).\n\nCarrying a child puts someone at a disadvantaged position, and carrying a stranger's child does so a hundred fold. The very very least someone can do for that person who is giving you such a priceless gift is letting them lead and prioritizing their comfort and their choices. It's the very bare minimum that comes with the bar is in hell kind of jokes.\n\nNot recognizing and appreciating the vulnerable position the surrogate has put herself in forces the woman carrying the pregnancy in an even worse position. Badgering, pushing, touching and putting one's own feelings and desires above the frankly saintly lady doing you a favour that cannot really be repaid is too much. It's such a huge AH move to the surrogate that even such a harsh reply of \"you could/should have gotten pregnant then\" is not unfair nor uncalled for imo.\n\nAll that said, I agree with you that the complex feelings of one dealing with infertility should be worked on in therapy before this kind of venture is attempted because no one involved is going to have an even barely tolerable time otherwise.", "She isn't their incubator and her needs and boundaries come before their wants. There, all done.", "OP doesn't like it. Now, is she touching her baby or is she touching OP's body?", "Yeah, I\u2019ve been pregnant and given birth multiple times, so I am *well* aware of the effects it can have.

Perhaps you replied to the wrong person, as I never said anything definitive about how pregnancy might affect your body, I made a comment about what some people think. Period.", "Yes that\u2019s her!! I saw she was preggers again. I\u2019m glad she is still doing well!", "> Well while me and wife were at a baby appointment last week she reached over and rubbed my stomach while talking to the doctor. I kindly asked her to stop touching my stomach and she snapped at me and said I was ruining the experience for her and it\u2019s her baby she should be able to feel her kick. I snapped back and said that it may be her baby but it\u2019s my body and that if she really wanted to feel her baby kick she should\u2019ve gotten pregnant herself.\n> I\u2019ve gotten calls from her and her husband calling me an AH for yelling at her for **bonding with her child.**\n\nSurrogate mom and dad see feeling the baby move as bonding.", "Experiencing the child move and kick I guess is a way mothers begin to connect to their children. Since she isn't carrying the child, she is missing out on that experience. You are right, it didn't outright say that, just what I have heard.", "I am happy you had a good outcome. I will pass it on to my cousin - gently, she\u2019s very unhappy with the whole thing. I guess when it\u2019s affecting someone\u2019s job it\u2019s even worse.\n\nMy mom never had her fixed. Also twins, but those were different times - such operations weren\u2019t widely available in the 70s and 80s, at least not where we live. Now, she in her seventies and it is really affecting her badly. She\u2019s got a huge hernia because of it (according to her doctor) but she cannot have surgery done because of her other medical issues - she\u2019s now unlikely to survive it :/ That whole pregnancy business could have been handled a wee bit better by nature. The chosen design is chock full of bugs.", "No.\nWomen\u2019s body are not suddenly public property when they become surrogates.\n\n\nThe father of my children asked if he could touch my stomach *every single time* and respected it if I said no.", "Well it would seem if they wanted to be able to have anything they would need to discuss it.  Anything else would default to a no.", "Most cases where this has been an issue have come down on the side of the birthing woman - ie the baby belongs to the birthing woman.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few years since I read up on it though - so things may have changed.", "So what? \n\nThere is no evidence at all that backs up what they\u2019re saying.\n\nJust ten years ago midwives were noising around nonsense like \u201cnipple confusion\u201d too - but that\u2019s also bullshit.\n\nDon\u2019t put medical staff on a pedestal - their information is often outdated or flat out incorrect. \n\nCorrelation is not causation. They are not doing any sort of standard of study - they have no way of controlling variables, for example.", "Ok and? It is still her choice to do it at that price. If I work at one place I can get paid $7, it's up to me to take the job or not. If I do, I know I'll get paid $7. She could always have said no to the job", "They have a contract and she is earning money for this. When was she last time you were contracted and paid for a favor?", "Meh I don\u2019t agree there. I personally think that something outside of someone\u2019s control should never be turned into an insult; infertility, physical features, disabilities, etc should be respected as individual differences, not flaws. If someone else has already turned something into an insult, then okay \u2014 you can use that insult in return. In rare cases, it may be justified if the insult they used is close enough that it would be the closest equivalency. But otherwise, stick to things in their control.\n\nIf we keep the situation the same except that the surrogacy family battled infertility, I think an appropriate response would have been to target whether they\u2019re fit to parent, rather than targeting the infertility. For example, \u201cMa\u2019am, parenting is about doing what is best for your child, even if it means not getting the \u2018experience\u2019 you always dreamt of. Causing me distress while I am carrying this child is not good for your child, your child will not be able to \u2018bond\u2019 with you if my brain is sending stress signals. If you can\u2019t respect bodily autonomy even when it relates to the wellbeing of this child, how can you expect me to hand them over to you after the birth?\u201d I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a more succinct, sharper way to phrase the same message. Note how the attack is targeting her capacity as a parent, not her capacity as a birth-giver; it\u2019s more relevant, and doesn\u2019t poke at an insecurity and hurt she can\u2019t control. That\u2019s my thinking, at least.", "It is really not that hard to understand.", "Gotcha, I missed that. Probably would have been important for them to discuss in advance of OP getting pregnant", "I'm almost 9 months pregnant and I have no bond with this child yet. The doctor (and my therapist) have both told me it's normal and usual, since we bond over shared experiences and I have no experiences to share with this kid yet.", "Okay idc", "Sure, OP is legally in the right but these are ppl she had a good relationship with prior and, presumably, wanted to stay amicable. Seems like something they should\u2019ve discussed no?", "Ugh you're really annoying and uninformed. I didn't say it was a study, but their experience in the field definitely has merit and trusting that isn't putting anyone \"on a pedestal\". You don't know me or the thought and research I put into my medical decisions outside of my professional care so you have no right to speak on it.", "I have been paid for favors before.", "I get your thinking and I think your theoretical response truly is the best case scenario.\n\nAlso, I largely agree with you in regards to not kicking someone for something that they cannot change and that possibly is even a cause of hurt. But, in this made up scenario I can't help but still lightly more be on the side of NTA for the pregnant woman.\n\nI'm going to try to explain my thought process here. I feel you are approaching it from the angle of primary empathy for the infertile woman in this scenario. And maybe leaving to the side that the pregnant woman is going to feel hormonal, upset and possibly even cornered, being in such a vulnerable position as carrying a child. And carrying a child for a relatively unknown person that in that moment is showing her that they are putting their fantasy and desires over her *needs*. That's very close to feeling like a human incubator.\n\nSuch situations are bound to be messy. Lashing out in such a case with an emotional response wouldn't be a calculated move to hurt someone to hurt them; it would be just that, an emotional response from someone who is feeling disregarded, objectified, unheard and who is trying to reclaim a bit of their power and identity back.\n\nThe imbalance of power (and I'm not going to get into it too much here) is such that it still tips the scales into NTA for me.\n\nAll that said, I respect you thinking about it and coming with an ideal reply that likely would de-escalate the brewing storm in a thoughtful, decisive and kind way.

It means they have a distorted view of their body, feeling like they're ugly when they actually aren't. Surgery or dieting generally doesn't help, because the problem is with their body image, not their actual body.\n\nThe condition trans people often have is called gender dysphoria. It's the distress that results from having a body that doesn't fit their gender identity. For dysphoric people, changing their body does help, and they'll feel better once their body matches their gender.\n\nEither condition could be a reason not to want to go through a pregnancy though.", "This is a take that comes from a place of privilege", "thanks im non-binary and just kinda wrapped it up into one term but that distinction is important so i appreciate you pointing it out. shoulda clarified, i can edit it to add it", "It shouldn't be a big deal, but unfortunately I've seen bigots conflate the two in an attempt to discredit trans people, that's why I always point this out.
