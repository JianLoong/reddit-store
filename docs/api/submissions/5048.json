Always stay three to four steps away from them so they can't physically touch you. Don't sit next to her and stay out of arms reach from now on whenever possible. If it's not possible, deliberately use your body to point your stomach away from her and her husband.\n\nBeing pregnant and feeling babies kicks is an experience she took away from herself. You're not obligated to let her use your body in that manner.\n\nYou should have a calm discussion and explain to them that you don't like others touching your stomach. That is a very intimate activity and makes you uncomfortable, esp when it's done without permission or consent. You want to be comfortable in your pregnancy and grow a healthy baby. Tell them they are NOT entitled to touch your stomach and to not do it again.\n\n If they can't respect that, you can ask that they wait in the waiting room during your appointments with your doctor. You have that right, even as a surrogate. They don't have to be there with you in the room with access to violate your body autonomy. They need to read up on laws of consent.

And the wife was 100% out of line, for a billion reasons. But it's kind of ridiculous to expect that the parents of the baby not feel any kicks AT ALL. Yes, it's your body so you can say no to touching but you need to give a little since it's their baby.", "This is my first surrogacy.

I'm currently pregnant and my midwives told me that if you rub your stomach a lot those babies tend to be better soothed by rubbing their backs. Same with patting or swaying, whatever you do to the belly the babies show a preference for after birth.\n\nThis is absolutely not an excuse for the mother's actions! OP is firmly NTA, just wanted to share this fun fact.", "It absolutely is a favor. Carrying someone\u2019s else\u2019s child in your body is a favor, regardless of payment.", "It's still a favor. Pregnancy and birth do serious damage to the vaginal area and your body's core. It's a huge favor to put yourself through that for someone else. The pay is a reflection of the fact you're at work 24/7 for nine months straight and a compensation for the damage and changes the pregnancy does to a women's body.", "Is it possible for her to wait outside the room and then come ask the doctor questions once you have been examined? It could fulfill the terms of the contract without putting her in touching distance. You could even give the office a heads up about her boundary crossing ways.\n\nI had to edit because I forgot my vote.

Goal here is to make the person look shallow for putting looks over pregnancy.\n\nSurrogacy is expensive and personal training doesn\u2019t pay that well.  So this means if they are a well off family able to afford surrogacy then the husband as a well paying job and then her concern over taking time off from her career for a year seems suspext.\n\nSo the combination of 24yr old Lesbian surrogate being a surrogate for a wealthy person who can have a baby but chooses not to because she is concerned for her career is unlikely to be true.", "I honestly didn\u2019t think I had to since they were around for my pregnancy with my daughter and knew then that I was uncomfortable with people touching my stomach", "You don't have to have a contract to not be touched.", "Sorry, I should have been clearer.  It does nothing to bond the baby to their biological mom rather than to the surrogate.", "It's always a VOLUNTARY sign-up. She's totally NTA for not allowing them to touch her belly if she's uncomfortable, but to put it as s favor is wrong: \n1. When she entered it knowing what she will get into (she's already had a kid) \n2. Probably getting paid/compensated for it", "To clear some things up her husband does have a well paying job. She doesn\u2019t want to take time off her career and also doesn\u2019t want to potentially hurt the baby while pregnant. Both are perfectly understandable reasons that I don\u2019t judge. Also I\u2019m not a lesbian and have no idea where that even came from lol. These are family friends I\u2019ve known for years.

Her wanting to preserve her figure is selfish.", "Understood then I\u2019m going to say ESH because I think you should have communicated that explicitly. Both parties failed to communicate in that regard. You assumed they\u2019d know your limit and they assumed they\u2019d be exempt as it\u2019s a fairly normal expectation the parents would have BUT once you made it clear that it was a hard boundary for you they needed to respect that and deal with their disappointment privately.", "Obviously, I was just curious as to whether or not she included it since it\u2019s such a firm boundary for OP and May have influenced their decision to choose another surrogate.", "Oh I see what you mean! Yeah I doubt baby can tell the difference between who is touching them. I definitely like your suggestions of recording voices to play for baby.", "She\u2019s not six figures but she does have quite a few clients. Also the husband has a well paying job and has made a name for himself in my community", "OP literally stated that she has known this family for awhile and WHILE she was pregnant with her own daughter (and they knew then that she did not want her belly touched). Now, why would this change? It is NOT OP's obligation to inform them on something they already know.

Those choices have consequences however and one of them being not able to feel the kicking unless the surrogate approves it.

Also, make sure you have an attorney to ensure any payments they owe you are made before they take the baby home from the hospital.", "NTA Your body...your choice. But if you're in the U.S. nobody understands that anymore.", "NTA. This is a perfect example of why surrogacy is kind of gross and exploitative to me. I know for many people there is no other way to have biological kids, but there are countless children in need of adoption out there. I feel like surrogacy is just one more way for rich people to exploit and use the poor for their own selfish purposes.", "NTA\n\nYou still have agency over your own body.

But also, I find it to be strange to become a surrogate and know you\u2019re not comfortable with the parents touching your stomach. \n\nWhat you\u2019re doing is very admirable but I feel like it would be expected that they would want to rub your stomach and would\u2019ve been a reason to talk to them about it before going through with it and potentially turn it down.", "NAH There\u2019s nothing wrong with them wanting to experience feeling the baby kick as this is their child. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with you not wanting to be touched. But your attitude is obnoxious. It\u2019s your body your choice, but it seems dumb to not have realized that the parents would want to feel their baby kick as a way to connect and experience the whole thing.", "ESH\n\nThis should have been discussed before you agreed to became their surrogate. You are definitely allowed to put up a boundary of people not touching you but of course the family are going to want to feel the baby.", "I'm kind of leaning N A H because I can understand her wanting to feel the baby... but it's ultimately your body, and your boundaries. You're NTA for not wanting to be touched.\n\nI've seen some snide comments about how if she's able bodied but using a surrogate, it's because she wants a perfect figure, among other shallow assumptions. Pregnancy is a huge deal. For some it goes smoothly, but in general it can absolutely ravage your body. All manner of complications that you don't typically hear about can happen.

And OP is callous and unreasonable.", "NTA - but you\u2019re being petty and vindictive for chastising the mother for choosing surrogacy when she is supposedly capable of carrying a pregnancy - that has nothing to do with the issue of her touching your stomach when you don\u2019t want her to. The couple chose surrogacy and you agreed to do it for pay, stop judging her and being mean about it. The reason for surrogacy is irrelevant here. And honestly, you sound like you are harboring ill will or resentment against the couple because of your comment that the wife is capable of carrying a pregnancy. \n\nIt is totally understandable that the mother would want to feel the baby move/kick.  It is also understandable that you may not want people touching your stomach. Because this is a paid arrangement and there is no other way for the mother to feel the baby move/kick, I would allow her to touch your stomach to feel that movement - just once, and for like a minute max. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re pregnant with your own baby and you have agreed to give it to the couple for adoption. It\u2019s their baby you are carrying.", "NTA.  It's your body. Just because you're carrying their baby, it doesn't mean they own your body and can touch you whenever you want.  You set a boundary and she violated it. I'm a mom and when I was pregnant, I didn't want anyone touching me.", "NTA - what hypocrisy; she is using a surrogate because of her desire for bodily autonomy and yelling at you for exercising your own. They paid for you to live a healthy lifestyle while carrying and providing them with their child, not to grope you.", "EHS, obvi you get to decide who touches your body where when why and how and her breaking that boundary is unacceptable no question. You're also in an impossible situation no matter how ironclad your contract is because no one really wins. She's leased your body and its abilities and trusted you with her child, and you agreed to that. You both want your cake and to eat it to, and it sounds like you're both disappointed. I hope it's a safe delivery of a healthy baby so you can cut ties with the family you've become enmeshed in.", "First, I was inclined to think E S H for not navigating this issue before proceeding with the surrogacy. I can absolutely understand a couple who'd engaged a surrogate, regardless their reasoning, expecting that they would be able to feel the baby's movements and bond with it in that way. That should have been explicit from the outset. \n\nBut, that's a secondary issue to her touching you without your consent. So, I'm saying you're NTA. But you should make certain they can't make your life dramatically worse if they decide to become irrational or vindictive. \n\nWhen you combine pregnancy with bureaucracy and contracts, you create the potential for someone to use that bureaucracy as a weapon.", "NTA - your body, you get to decide who touches you. If she wants to feel her baby move and she has no health problems/issues preventing this, she should get pregnant herself.", "NTA.

They obviously consented to getting pregnant, going to appointments with mom, and it sounds like dietary changes as well. Those had to be discussed to even draft the contract, why not discuss physical contact boundaries then too?\n\nI don't disagree with your statement on consent at all but it sounds like with surrogacy these things need to discussed A LOT before anyone signs anything. When you are selling your body's abilities as a service, in any sense, you need to come to the table with full transparency and established boundaries, or it's not informed consent for anyone involved. It sounds like they didn't talk about this aspect of the pregnancy AT ALL before deciding to create this life together.\n\n Obvi Mom is the bigger asshole for crossing op's boundaries and touching her against her will. I just have to wonder if any of these adults did have any sense or foresight and discussed it beforehand, would this be a deal breaker for the parents, had they been informed? Bodily autonomy is a far higher importance than financial, but by mixing the two I just don't think it's as cut and dry.", "Yeah I agree a little.\n\nLike on one hand, NTA to not want to be touched. It is still her body and she still has complete autonomy. No means no. And the future mother is an asshole for pushing the matter after OP already said no multiple times.\n\nBut on the other hand, it is odd to me that she'd even want to be a surrogate, knowing this bothers her this much. Not wanting complete strangers to touch her belly I understand, but obviously the parents would want to feel the baby kick, etc. I'm sure for them it's very meaningful. But oh well, I guess that's something for them to keep in mind if they have another kid via surrogacy.", "The service is not the experience of pregnancy, it\u2019s the baby.

Dietary changes and doctors visits are more than just \"carrying the baby\", they obviously have an expectation for how the pregnancy would go outside of \"birth a baby for me\". There was ample time to discuss this and in the same way mom and dad assumed it would be okay, OP assumed they paid enough attention to her other pregnancy to already know.

Or me for not taking them. I'm healthy enough to carry a kid, but that part makes it not a great idea.", "OP's comment said that they knew that she was uncomfortable with her stomach being touched. Honestly, either way, it does not matter in the slightest. OP does not have to initiate that conversation in the slightest. The family knew about this. They should have been the ones to communicate.", "If you are physically and healthily are able to carry a child, but simply don't want to because of discomfort or bodily changes, you should adopt not risk another woman's life (as low as it is, it's still a risk) to have your own biological baby.", "There are a lot of things that people will \u201cchoose\u201d to do for money if they are desperate enough. Doesn\u2019t mean that we as a civilized society should allow it.", "it\u2019s insane people are downvoting as well. just shows that they don\u2019t care about the risks of pregnancy. if you ever decide to have kiddos, i hope all goes well and safely no matter which decision you need to make! i just hope you\u2019d prioritize yourself however that may be \n\ni have a cousin that loved being a surrogate because she loves being pregnant (didn\u2019t even know that was a thing lol) so some people really don\u2019t mind on top of a sizable payout", "I think it was on both parties to establish clear communication around this issue. OP could have reasonably assumed that they\u2019d expect to touch her belly and they could have reasonably assumed that they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to but a surrogate agreement is no place for assumptions.", "Why don\u2019t these concerns about risks of pregnancy extend to the surrogate? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "I don't think you can \"reasonably\" assume that you get to touch someone's body just because your baby is in it. It should not even be an issue. The family saw that OP was uncomfortable with her belly being touched while she's pregnant, they should bring that up if it is a big deal to them. OP isn't in the wrong here at all. And then for the wife to act that way after it being brought up multiple times that OP was NOT comfortable? It's weird."]}
