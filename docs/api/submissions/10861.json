He basically invited everyone to watch by forcing everybody to listen.", "Lol NTA and I love your way of dealing with that! Just annoying him right back in a completely harmless way", "NTA, this is fantastic.", "NTA. Amazing.", "NTA - I actually think you found the perfect solution to an obnoxious passenger that wouldn't follow the rules!  Your commentary on friends was hilarious!", "NTA- so your friend is happy for this man to invade your personal space but thought you were a dick for finding a (genius) gloriously pass agg way of shutting him up and getting rid of it?\n\nYour friend is a pushover.", "NTA. Lea is though, just as much as that annoying guy, if she had aimed her comments at the guy as forcefully as she did to you he probably wouldn't have been so rude (and back up from the other people at your table would have been nice!) I find typically people who are like Lea aim their annoyance at friends because its easier and safer than aiming it at strangers, she needs to build up her confidence a bit more and stop being a pushover. I don't think she's mad at you, she's mad at the rude guy and probably a little mad at herself for not having the courage and fortitude you have, let her know you won't stand being her sound board when she is annoyed she couldn't handle a situation as well as you did. Definitely don't listen to her or you will both end up meek little mice instead of a mouse and a lion lol.", "Definitely NTA. You did great. There is no excuse for him to play audio without headphones in any section of the train much less the quiet section. \n\nThe way he responded to your request shows that he is probably a bully. I bet the other passengers were cheering you on - silently - because it's a quiet carriage.", "NTA. Listening to devices by speaker in public is super rude and obnoxious", "Haha - NTA -  he was being rude and inconsiderate in the quiet car.  He didn\u2019t deserve any consideration from you after that, including respect for his \u201cpersonal space\u201d .\n\nDoes your friend have a lot of trouble standing up for herself when people treat her badly?", "NTA\n\nThe stranger was absolutely the AH here.   Who gets into a **quiet car** and then doesn't wear headphones?  A total AH, that's who.  \n\nBecause he started the whole thing with his AH behavior, and then added to it by refusing to do anything about it when you asked nicely, you were justified in doing that to \"force\" him to move.  Presumably to a seat that's **not** in a quiet car.", "NTA and you dealt with it perfectly. He invaded YOUR space with noise. He didn't like you doing the same. He basically fucked around and found out. Not sure why Lea is on his side tbh", "NTA he invaded your personal space with his noise. If he didn't want everyone joining in he should have put his headphones in. But be careful who you do stuff like this to some people react with violence to being confronted.", "NTA. Slay \ud83d\udc85", "NTA,  and kudos with such a great way to get him to move.", "NTA\n\nYour reaction was brilliant!\n\n[Edited because apparently I can't tell the difference between ! and ?  I'm going to have to get glasses, aren't I?!?]", "I would of gotten the attending person to notice and got him kicked off. He should of gotten on a different part of the train. Your friend needs to grow a backbone because if they let people walk all over them then they are going to be sad in life.   \n\n\nNTA he was though", "NTA\n\nThe perfect reaction. And the right outcome.", "NTA. Okay, you were not being nice, but neither was he. Sounds like your friend has internalized the idea that women should always be nice and forgiving regardless of what happens which I think is bullshit.", "NTA. You\u2019re a champion, and that bloke is a wanker who got the nicest possible version of what he deserved. Can\u2019t stand these brats who won\u2019t use headphones in a shared space. (And \u201cFriends\u201d? I know it\u2019s not the point, different strokes for different folks, blah blah, but to me these selfish bozos always seem to have taste as shitty as their manners.)", "NTA\n\nAnd Lea needs to stop being such a doormat.\n\nI do wish the guards would enforce the Quiet Zones, but the assholish reaction of the guy you encountered does make me realise why they don't want to get involved; their job is bad enough already.", "NTA\n\n\nHe lacked basic manners, you just commented on the show he so *graciously* put on for EVERYONE to hear.", "NTA- Iwould have been less polite. The I pad would have left via the window.\n\nGood job!", "NTA. You asked nicely, you made every effort to be diplomatic and he refused. Rules are rules on transport. Your friend is being unreasonable.", "NTA. He was forcing an audience, you simply accepted the invitation in a hilarious way!  Love it, totally going to remember this tactic!", "NTA - *Dignified slow golf clap*. Well done.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be giving no asshole my headphones \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 just because your friend is okay with sitting and being annoyed for 4 hours doesn\u2019t mean you have to be, I think you handled it perfectly.", "NTA at all. He chose to make watching his tv show a public activity. In doing so, he opened himself up to public participation.", "This made me laugh out loud", "Lea is a bit of a pushover \ud83d\ude02 at the point she was like \u2018you could have given him your headphones\u2019 I was like babes you\u2019re having a laugh. \n\nAnd 100%, I knew involving a guard would just escalate the situation and also made me feel really childish and \u2018snitchy\u2019 after his comment \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "> \u2018you could have given him your headphones\u2019 \n\nI mean, really, *no*.\n\n>I knew involving a guard would just escalate the situation\n\nsince it wouldn't solve it, yeah", "NTA he invaded your space and the rules of the quiet carriage. How you went about sorting it was creative (and brave, not sure I would be able to do that in case it escalated). Plus you asked him to stop first. Was the best option to tell the staff? Maybe, but they're not always around", "NTA, that's fucking hilarious. Fuck that guy.", "NTA. I know whenever anyone writes \"and everyone around clapped at what I did\" it's a blatant lie. \n\nBut damn, loud iPad in the quiet carriage! Outrageous.\n\nI would have (quietly) clapped you.", "NTA I LOVE YOU LMAO\n\nYou paid extra for a quiet ride to get work done. He literally broke the \"rules\", the quiet sections are, would you believe it, MEANT TO BE QUIET.\n\nFuck it up, teach him a lesson.", "You paid extra to book your seat on the train?! In the UK?! Anyway, why not get the guard involved if you really care and the annoyed stares aren't working?", "NTA.  Masterclass OP!  He was the first to \"invade\" your space with the racket anyway", "Nta when in public headphones are polite. You were just giving the guy a taste of his own medicine.", "NTA. Lea doesn\u2019t like confrontation and she\u2019s allowed that but he invaded your personal space with his noise. Why do people feel it\u2019s okay to listen to their phones/devices/speakerphone etc out loud in public shared spaces? It\u2019s not okay.", "NTA. There ought to be a soft social norm that, if you're watching something out loud in a public space, then you are sharing the show so that anyone else can also watch with you.", "You took a very rude situation and used humor to resolve. Well done!", "NTA that was the perfect response.", "NTA. Boss move!", "NTA\n\nHe's the AH for sitting in the quiet section without headphones. It's not even an UNSPOKEN rule, it's a SPOKEN rule that you put on headphones in public to watch things.", "NTA. Nice username.", "NTA plus, if you did, \"tell on him,\" the conductor would tell him to move or turn it because you were in the quiet car. I've seen it happen before.", "NTA You're my hero.   \n\nBut your friend Lea is a coward and a pushover.", "NTA Stellar work!", "NTA! Excellent way to deal with someone so rude.", "You\u2019re my hero \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I could never have the courage to do this but that\u2019s amazing.", "NTA - He was being obnoxious, and you were obnoxious back.  *chef\u2019s kiss*", "I think you were brilliant", "NTA, and well played. I also tend to go for the quiet coach. I know a small amount of noise is unavoidable, but this guy was just a knob.", "NTA - you did just the right thing .. Lea must be annoying at times with massive passive aggressiveness", "NTA brilliant strategy.\n\nWell done.", "NTA.  That is a hilarious way to handle it", "NTA. He should have read a book if he didn\u2019t have headphones", "NTA you fought fire with fire.  Good work.  Next time, cut a few farts loose to help him leave sooner.", "NTA, I honestly hate people who watch their phone louding in trains or bus, I know it is public place - you can do whatever you want but there should some respect for people who might be working or studying...", "NTA. Well handled. He knew he was in the wrong and thought he could bully you.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou did not invade, he freely shared the video with you.", "NTA. The rules are if you want to use electronics in the quiet carriage, you must have headphones. You are also not expected to answer your phone there or make calls - it is a QUIET carriage. Your reaction to him was completely justified and hilarious - and yes, you should have \"told\" on him - he was being an entitled, selfish, inconsiderate child.", "NTA.\n\nI've often had the urge to do this on the DC Metro, but never had the guts.  There are no \"quiet cars\", but people carry on a loud conversation on speaker -- many times, both sides are saying really personal stuff that nobody on the train has any business hearing, but the person just assumes we're all going to \"not hear it\".  \n\nI've often wanted to go, \"Are you kidding?  I can't believe you said that to him\" or something else. Might get attacked, though, so I never did it.\n\nKudos to OP.  If a rider makes something public, it's public, and fair game.", "you are amazing good for you", "NTA I apologize if this sounds harsh but your friend is a freaking coward. She rather sit for FOUR HOURS listening to some &\\^&\\^hat blare FRIENDS in the train car that YOU PAID MONEY to be quite. She rather do this than have a confrontation.. Hell no, your friend needs to get a backbone.", "100% NTA.  He should not have even been doing that in a regular carriage - it\u2019s rude and insensitive to your fellow passengers.  To do it in the quiet carriage is beyond the pale. So if he refuses to follow etiquette, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with you doing the same in order to get him to follow the rules. Also, quite hilarious what you did; and brilliant.\n\nBy the way, you wouldn\u2019t have been out of line to have called the conductor either - they would have created even more of a fuss.", "NTA You are my heroine, and your friend should be applauding you! Excellent, non confrontational way to get the inconsiderate dick to move on.\n\nOther people's lack of courtesy regarding headphones, let alone in a train's quiet carriage, is one of my biggest public transport peeves.", "In the US on Amtrak Trains on the Northeast Corridor (Boston-NYC-DC) every train has a \"quiet car\" so people can rest or do work. You need to use headphones if watching a movie or listening to.music. I have seen conductors enforce this. \n\nHad I paid extra (we don't), like you did, and had I mentioned to someone in the quiet car that they were disturbing me, refused to stop, and they asked if I was going to report them, I would have accepted the challenge done exactly that.\n\nNTA. You gave him a taste of his own medicine. But he definitely was an AH, and your friend was too for saying you invaded the other passenger's personal space and not taking your side.", "NTA. In fact, a hero.", "Your friend and people like her are why he thought he'd get away with it. Well done. Next time he's on a train he MAY think twice. NTA", "Brilliant respond \n\nNta", "NTA and yes, your friend is a doormat. You came up with the least confrontational solution and it worked. I would have \u201ctold\u201d on him lol.", "NTA\n\nJust the right amount of petty .. he deserved everything you done .. his kind are the worst to travel with", "NTA: You are a true hero.", "NTA\nYou did a good job of making him go away so you could complete your work in a space that you literally paid for. Well done.", "NTA for the situation as described, but I do kind of think Y T A, as it does read like \u201chey guys, look at this funny thing I did!\u201d", "Agree! Just lmfao at op providing commentary and joining in on watching the show with that guy. Giving a stranger who\u2019s being a pain in the ass your headphones? No way, yuck. Lea needs to work on her own conflict resolution skills.. NTA", "NTA, you were right to call him out and this does seem less confrontation than \u201ctelling on him\u201d. Do the attendants respond to such complaints and do they do anything about it, or is it all based on peer pressure", "Oooo.....yes, yes!  This is an excellent way of looking at the situation.\n\nAnd, may I add, I SO admire the OP's utterly calm nerves of steel. This took guts to pull off!", "I think you have some great insight here, friend.", "Definitely would've loved to be another passenger watching this unfold", "That does sound strange. The Trainline charges you a booking fee on the day but that's for the ticket rather than the seat, maybe OP got confused?", ">And 100%, I knew involving a guard would just escalate the situation and also made me feel really childish and \u2018snitchy\u2019 after his comment \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \n\nYou're 33 mate, don't worry about 'snitching' I wish I had your balls at our age. If anything I would have bought you a drink from the trolley when it came down in pure disbelief.", "Also, love the username. My sister always says \u201cgoing for a cheeky Nando\u2019s\u201d (or insert other fast food/casual place) and I never understand what is a cheeky about it\u2026.(but then I haven\u2019t lived in the UK in 20 years and maybe it makes something different now?)"]}
