He basically invited everyone to watch by forcing everybody to listen.", "Lol NTA and I love your way of dealing with that! Just annoying him right back in a completely harmless way", "NTA, this is fantastic.", "NTA. Amazing.", "NTA - I actually think you found the perfect solution to an obnoxious passenger that wouldn't follow the rules!  Your commentary on friends was hilarious!", "NTA- so your friend is happy for this man to invade your personal space but thought you were a dick for finding a (genius) gloriously pass agg way of shutting him up and getting rid of it?\n\nYour friend is a pushover.", "NTA. Lea is though, just as much as that annoying guy, if she had aimed her comments at the guy as forcefully as she did to you he probably wouldn't have been so rude (and back up from the other people at your table would have been nice!) I find typically people who are like Lea aim their annoyance at friends because its easier and safer than aiming it at strangers, she needs to build up her confidence a bit more and stop being a pushover. I don't think she's mad at you, she's mad at the rude guy and probably a little mad at herself for not having the courage and fortitude you have, let her know you won't stand being her sound board when she is annoyed she couldn't handle a situation as well as you did. Definitely don't listen to her or you will both end up meek little mice instead of a mouse and a lion lol.", "Definitely NTA. You did great. There is no excuse for him to play audio without headphones in any section of the train much less the quiet section. \n\nThe way he responded to your request shows that he is probably a bully. I bet the other passengers were cheering you on - silently - because it's a quiet carriage.", "NTA. Listening to devices by speaker in public is super rude and obnoxious", "Haha - NTA -  he was being rude and inconsiderate in the quiet car.  He didn\u2019t deserve any consideration from you after that, including respect for his \u201cpersonal space\u201d .\n\nDoes your friend have a lot of trouble standing up for herself when people treat her badly?", "NTA\n\nThe stranger was absolutely the AH here.   Who gets into a **quiet car** and then doesn't wear headphones?  A total AH, that's who.  \n\nBecause he started the whole thing with his AH behavior, and then added to it by refusing to do anything about it when you asked nicely, you were justified in doing that to \"force\" him to move.  Presumably to a seat that's **not** in a quiet car.", "NTA and you dealt with it perfectly. He invaded YOUR space with noise. He didn't like you doing the same. He basically fucked around and found out. Not sure why Lea is on his side tbh", "NTA he invaded your personal space with his noise. If he didn't want everyone joining in he should have put his headphones in. But be careful who you do stuff like this to some people react with violence to being confronted.", "NTA. Slay \ud83d\udc85", "NTA,  and kudos with such a great way to get him to move.", "NTA\n\nYour reaction was brilliant?", "I would of gotten the attending person to notice and got him kicked off. He should of gotten on a different part of the train. Your friend needs to grow a backbone because if they let people walk all over them then they are going to be sad in life.   \n\n\nNTA he was though", "NTA\n\nThe perfect reaction. And the right outcome.", "NTA. Okay, you were not being nice, but neither was he. Sounds like your friend has internalized the idea that women should always be nice and forgiving regardless of what happens which I think is bullshit.", "NTA. You\u2019re a champion, and that bloke is a wanker who got the nicest possible version of what he deserved. Can\u2019t stand these brats who won\u2019t use headphones in a shared space. (And \u201cFriends\u201d? I know it\u2019s not the point, different strokes for different folks, blah blah, but to me these selfish bozos always seem to have taste as shitty as their manners.)", "NTA\n\nAnd Lea needs to stop being such a doormat.\n\nI do wish the guards would enforce the Quiet Zones, but the assholish reaction of the guy you encountered does make me realise why they don't want to get involved; their job is bad enough already.", "NTA\n\n\nHe lacked basic manners, you just commented on the show he so *graciously* put on for EVERYONE to hear.", "NTA- Iwould have been less polite. The I pad would have left via the window.\n\nGood job!", "NTA. You asked nicely, you made every effort to be diplomatic and he refused. Rules are rules on transport. Your friend is being unreasonable.", "NTA. He was forcing an audience, you simply accepted the invitation in a hilarious way!  Love it, totally going to remember this tactic!", "NTA - *Dignified slow golf clap*. Well done.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be giving no asshole my headphones \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 just because your friend is okay with sitting and being annoyed for 4 hours doesn\u2019t mean you have to be, I think you handled it perfectly.", "NTA at all. He chose to make watching his tv show a public activity. In doing so, he opened himself up to public participation.", "This made me laugh out loud", "Lea is a bit of a pushover \ud83d\ude02 at the point she was like \u2018you could have given him your headphones\u2019 I was like babes you\u2019re having a laugh. \n\nAnd 100%, I knew involving a guard would just escalate the situation and also made me feel really childish and \u2018snitchy\u2019 after his comment \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "> \u2018you could have given him your headphones\u2019 \n\nI mean, really, *no*.\n\n>I knew involving a guard would just escalate the situation\n\nsince it wouldn't solve it, yeah"]}
