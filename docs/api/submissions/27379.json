You informed Susan about your boundaries which she kept pushing. NTA\n\nWishing you a safe delivery, a healthy baby, and a smooth recovery!", "Susan is definitely a weirdo. I'm feeling creeped out just reading what she said.\n\nIt's probably best she's upset and now avoiding you. If you hadn't said to her that her comments were inappropriate and making you feel uncomfortable, think how much worse she could potentially get going forward?. If that's how Susan is meeting a work colleague for the first time, think what she'd be like after a few weeks lol.", "NAH\nWell done for standing up for your boundaries when she was making you uncomfortable. You did so in a polite way, so you can\u2019t be an AH in this situation. \nI also don\u2019t think there was any malice behind Susan\u2019s comments. If I had to guess, she probably didn\u2019t have a strong support system and didn\u2019t feel comfortable talking about all the gory pregnancy/birth details (and I say this 8 weeks postpartum myself) with her husband so she\u2019s reaching out to you to try and provide you with what she didn\u2019t have. It\u2019s misguided but ultimately kind, so she\u2019s not TA either.", "NTA\n\nIf you're uncomfortable you're uncomfortable. It's not a bad thing to set boundaries. That being said, this makes me curious if \"Susan\" may have had a bad experience and wants to support others. Miscarriages and still births are so much more common than people realize and many women & families just **don't talk about it** when it happens. Pure speculation, but perhaps she just wants to make sure you have someone to talk to through a stressful time. Either way, just because she wants to support you doesn't mean you should say yes to her offer. Solid NTA", "NTA. This was grossly overstepping the boundaries of polite and professional behaviour. Perhaps she was trying to make a friend or bond with you - it doesn't matter, you're not obligated to have an awkward and uncomfortable interaction just because someone has good intentions. \n\nAlso, she is allowing this to affect your work by avoiding you and taking longer to respond to your emails. You should either mention this to your supervisor or say something directly to Susan. \"Susan, is something bothering you? Since we met in the office you've been taking much longer to respond to my emails and you seem to be avoiding me.\"\n\nIn fact I'd mention it to your supervisor anyway, since Susan sounds like someone who might tell others that you are unfriendly/unkind/bullying her.\n\nAnd remember - she made this awkward, not you. Don't let anyone tell you that *you* made things awkward by asking her not to share her birth stories or offer you medical advice.", "NAH i feel like Susan was probably projecting a bit. Pregnancy can be really lonely for some women. My husband just couldn\u2019t comprehend any of what was going on with me when I was pregnant. Other moms were who helped me out. My own mom said her pregnancies were so long ago that she didn\u2019t remember anything. And all women in our office have help each other out right from leaves and day care policies and pumping facilities etc. \u201cMom to mom\u201d is a phrase we use often. My HOD had a long intimate chat with me when I first got pregnant including discussing nursing, traveling and returning to work with children - that chat is still something I look back on and i\u2019m sure that is what helped me not slip into PPD after my first. \n\nThat said, you\u2019re not the asshole for not being comfortable relying on someone you don\u2019t know well. I really don\u2019t see any assholes here. Good luck with your pregnancy.", "NTA. There might be any number of reasons for her behaviour. Perhaps she has some unresolved trauma from her own birth and is trying to resolve it in a weird and clumsy way. You're not her therapist, you're her colleague, and you acted reasonably in telling her so.", "That was completely rude of her. First, the audacity in assuming she's your friend. Second, being through something doesn't automatically make her an expert. Third, does she know this is your first child (assuming it is--you don't say in your post if it is). And fourth, why would she assume that you wouldn't want to wake your husband if your water broke (although to be fair, I don't have any kids, so maybe that would be a reasonable assumption)?\n\nThere are more classy ways to bond without being intrusive.", "\"This is the second time we've seen each other in person but here's what's going on with my vagina\" /s. She went too far imo. If she wanted to bond over motherhood, she could have just said \"if you need anything feel free to let me know.\" She didn't have to go into specifics. NTA", "She *may* have just been trying to make a female fellow mom friend. \n\nShe didn't go about it too well but it doesn't mean it was mean as creepy or mean.\n\nShe may just have been trying to show she supports her coworkers so much and earn points as the most helpful coworker. \n\nshe may have been trying to feel closer to when she had her children.\n\nshe may have a crush on you who knows I don't know what was in her head.\n\n That said if you felt she overstepped you probably did need to tell her, but there was definitely a gentler way to say I feel uncomfortable sharing these sort details with newer people in my life I am very private or something. Or she may just be afraid to get a penalty at work or maybe the boss spoke to her on it? \n\nEither way I feel like clear but kind is usually the way to go, if you can but we don't always do the best choices in the moment, so I am going with no one is an AH in this just some miscommunication and some awkward situations on both ends likely.", "NTA - I don't think Susan is the AH for trying to offer you support, but she is the AH for getting upset when you told her she was pushing your boundaries", "Even if she was just trying to make friends it\u2019s never okay to try and force someone into accepting your good willed offers for anything. Not only that but what mother about to have their first child wants to hear gloom and doom about someone else\u2019s experience? All she had to say was congratulations and if she really needed to mention herself say \u201cpregnancy was rough for me but I hope it goes better for you\u201d or something like that. \nNTA.", "NTA and I think you should let your supervisor and maybe HR know. This was wildly inappropriate as well as creepy bordering on a weird form of sexual harassment. Her response to your boundary is a red flag as well. Cover your ass sister. I don\u2019t get all off these waffling answers softballing her, as well as your mom. This lady is 100% in the wrong.", "NTA. She assumed that she was the only person you knew who has given birth. I wonder if her pregnancy was very isolating for her and again assumed that you were in the same spot. Still, she should have backed off the first time you told her you had it covered.", "You were spot on, NTA \n\nHave a super safe delivery of your little one. How exciting for you", "NTA you mentionned multiple time that you were not comfortable and she still disrespected your boundaries. I am also pregnant and I get the feeling. It's like everyone now has an opinion about the pregnancy and needs to share it without asking. Personnally I would go to HR if it comes to the point that it is impacting your work. Also the detail birth stories are the worst, it should be talked over with therapists, not with expecting mothers to \"prepare them\". In my opinion sharing personnal intimate details without expressed affirmative consent is disgusting behavior.", "NTA \"I am talking to you as your friend\" she's not your friend. She's a colleague, and barely an acquaintance at this stage. She's being weird and intrusive.", "NTA\n\n>Susan was clearly only looking to bond with me\n\nAha - so Susan was being rude. When your mum sees that, why is she calling you harsh? I seriously don't understand", "NTA\n\nSusan is creepy as hell and giving stalker vibes.  Started 3 weeks ago and at the first in person meet she's saying shit like \"I'm not speaking as your colleague, I am talking as your friend\" may want to check her basement... it puts the lotion on the skin or it gets the hose again.", "That is a tad much for your relationship level, or lack there of. You are entitled to your feelings, and you expressed them well. NTA.", "NAH You were \"happy to chat about the baby and the preparations.\"  Susan saw that and jumped right in.  She might have gone overboard, but the door was open for her to walk through it.\n\nWhy is your company not hiring a sub for you instead of off-loading all of your work on your coworkers?", "I'm torn between NTA and NAH. Susan would be wildly out of line in all jobs I've personally had but you did mention you are not in the US so _maybe_ Susan's behavior is not as egregious as it reads to me as an American.\n\nHowever you are definitely not the AH for her to stick to work-related topics. I'm pretty sure every culture in the world has a polite way to say \"mind your own business\".", "NTA. You felt uncomfortable. But I do feel like she was probably just trying to bond with another female coworker. It can be very difficult for some people to make friends at work because they don't read social boundaries well. She might have that issue. Also I don't blame her for avoiding you, she's probably embarrassed af. She probably feels like she overshared and overstepped and she did, but honestly I'd clear the air with her for the sake of your working relationship and just establish a firm boundary that you aren't looking to share your personal life with a coworker.", "No one\u2019s the asshole. I mean you could have phrased it in a different way or asked her about her experience, perhaps she experienced a miscarriage or something else traumatic where she didn\u2019t feel she had enough support, but just approached it from completely the wrong direction lol.", "Reddit is always so extreme in its responses. \n\nYou are NTA but I think your mom is right. Susan is likely not a complete psycho as people are making out, she probably wanted to make friends, had a difficult pregnancy herself and thought she was being helpful. She came off a bit weird but it doesn't seem malicious. Some people are just terribly socially unaware.", "I\u2019m actually going to lean to NAH. She wasn\u2019t trying to be malicious; many women\u2019s spouses don\u2019t want to hear the details, or they\u2019re not very supportive. \n\nDoctors don\u2019t typically warn pregnant women of atypical issues (pre-eclampsia, cholestasis, etc.) and it\u2019s often through \u201chey watch out for XYZ\u201d that it\u2019s even brought up. She may also have been trying to just check in on you as a person but going about it the wrong way\u2014**not that your husband is abusive, OP** but abuse escalates a LOT in pregnancy and giving warnings like she did is a way to gauge that.", "Susan sounds like a busybody who cannot read a room. \n\nYou were not harsh. She needed to be told to back off. How does she know you have nobody in your support system who's already given birth? \n\nNTA", "NTA. She wants permission to act unprofessionally towards you so she\u2019s giving you permission to act unprofessionally towards her. She wants to obliterate professional boundaries so she can bring \u201cthe village\u201d mentality to work. She wants solidarity in a motherhood bond with a virtual stranger. You are not obligated to enable her. \n\nGood on you for protecting your boundaries and not letting her act unprofessionally towards you. I would talk to your supervisor or personal relations person and start a paper trail. She sounds like she\u2019s gonna cause more drama in the future and it\u2019d be good to have paperwork to fall back on if you have to defend yourself.", "Nta very odd. Keep your boundaries.", "I\u2019ve actually noticed this is a pattern with previous generations and pregnancy. My best friend had a colleague tell her that her face has put on weight in her pregnancy- I was appalled for her and her mum said that the woman was just making conversation. My reply to that was that at she should find better topics of conversation. \n\nI think so many women were taught not to question the status quo even though they were insulted left right and centre. And now we\u2019re questioning it and calling it out when people are rude. \n\nOP you are NTA and your colleague needs up learn when to keep her opinions to herself. If I\u2019d have been told during my pregnancy when I was working to call someone to save walking my husband, I\u2019d have hit the roof in anger.", "As a F40 who\u2019s given birth, Susan was being DEEPLY weird and inappropriate. If anything, I\u2019d have gone further than you did and gone to HR.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nSusan overstepped.", "Not at all", "NTA, you gave her a fair and more than polite warning to back up a bit and she kept going.", "NTA but this is something you have to prepare for when you have kids: some women become weird and over-sharing when they realise you have kids. Some women lean hard into the whole \"sisterhood of motherhood\" thing and love to talk about pregnancy and child birth and think everyone who's been through it feels the same. You'll also get a new set of friends that you only know because you have kids the same age, and some will tell you in excruciating detail every gross thing their babies and kids do. I have no idea how to deal with them, I just don't respond and avoid them", "NTA you were totally fair with what you said. \n\nBut don\u2019t turn your back on this woman, reading what she said made my skin crawl", "Maybe having gone through childbirth and sharing my story in graphic detail to other moms (and them sharing theirs to me), but her offer seems pretty tame. She\u2019s right that sometimes it\u2019s easier to talk to someone who has experienced it. A lot of weird and gross stuff happens before and during childbirth, and a lot of that stuff is just not discussed. I didn\u2019t even know about the mucus plug until I was pregnant, and then didn\u2019t even know what was happening when it came out. It helped to talk to others who had been through it. \n\nNAH. It\u2019s ok that you are not comfortable receiving her help and guidance, and it\u2019s ok that she offered it.  You may feel differently after you\u2019ve gone through childbirth, but maybe you won\u2019t and that\u2019s ok too.", "Your mom is correct about the motivation (IMO) but that doesn\u2019t mean it was appropriate. NTA", "NAH It is a bit weird but technically a sweet offer. Just one you have no interest in.", "Susan thought you two were friends. To keep the peace I would text her and apologize for your harsh dismissal of her offer of help and let her know that it\u2019s appreciated, you were just caught off guard and already have your support system in place. She might not be great at making friends and wrongly thought you were her friend. Being nice to her now might save you from developing an enemy instead.\n\nNAH", "NAH \n\nSounds like she had a traumatic birth and didn't go into details, and she wanted to prereach out to you if you needed support. I don't think it was weird since she was only showing concern (but maybe that's because I had a miscarriage before).\n\nIf you felt she went past a boundary for you, that's okay as well. But you also gave people space in a professional environment to have unprofessional conversations. Essentially, you invited the conversation. To stop future instances from happening, maybe you shouldn't talk about it in the office?", "Lol, it is a bit strange. However, I do think she was trying to be nice and bond with you, she obviously went about it in the wrong way, but you cut her to the bone by saying what you said. I personally would have said, \"Thank you for offering\" and went about my day, instead of making it awkward for her. She may lack social skills, maybe have a touch of autism, maybe she is someone who likes to be needed or to help, or perhaps she maybe needed some support when she was pregnant and never got it and she thinks she's doing the right thing by offering to help you. I do think you are slightly the AH for how you responded to her. Sometimes people are weird but they are trying to be nice, and it says a lot about your personality in how you respond. At least she will know not to bother with you again.", "Nta. Report her to HR before she badmouth you", "People are weird about birthing things. Next time figure out how to set the boundary without jumping to \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 so quickly, but also nbd. \n\nCongrats!", "YTA. Even though the person is a bit forward with their intension. The person by no means was out of bounds, being rude, nor harmful. They were trying to be thoughtful and empathetic. \n\nMy wife is pregnant, and she tells me all the time \u201cI don\u2019t understand because I\u2019m not a woman\u201d and that\u2019s fair.

They dont help.", "I ride a motorcycle and it's not uncommon when someone finds out to tell me about a horrible accident they saw or someone in their family had while riding", "When my dog was attacked and had to go to the vet everyday for weeks to get her bandages changed, I could not believe how insensitive neighbors & coworkers were. So many people would bring up a story of how they witnessed a dog attack, bonus points for the stories where the dog didn't survive. The attack had been traumatic to witness for me and it was the last thing I wanted to hear about :/", "If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what is the preventable thing, and what would I need to look out for?

I try to arm myself with any information I can for the future.", "Maximum drama or bust!", "Same, especially given that she's an engineer.

You can get braxton-hicks (non labor contractions) really easily if you don't drink enough.  Always have a water bottle.  \n\nDon't go online and read horror stories or google every twinge.  You will drive yourself bonkers.\nDo ask your medical professionals as many questions as you need to, and get recommendations for vetted reading material.\n\nWhen in doubt, go to the doc/er.  They would rather see you for \"nothing\" than miss something important  (per several obstetrics nurses).\n\nWhatever you decide for feeding your kiddo is Ok! Even if you decide to breastfeed, realize that sometimes it doesn't work out the way we want it. I had to switch to formula for my second because working plus pumping did not work for me that pregnancy (where I was ok with my first).

We bought \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\" when I got pregnant. I remember two things: (1) that line \"you MAY be entitled to UP TO SIX WEEKS of maternity leave\" made me go, *aha, this book must be USian*; and (2) I told my husband to study the \"what can go wrong\" chapter so he could watch for nasty symptoms, but I wouldn't have to read it.", "I don't see how OP was *un*kind here though?\n\n'I'm good, thank you for the offer, but let's stick to work topics please' is hardly *rude.* I feel like trying to treat her with more grace would mean getting involved in Susan's business, and letting Susan get involved in hers.

Susan hasn't said, so how can anyone treat her with some grace if we don't know if its fact.\nIt'd be different if she said to OP that she experienced trauma, then of course you would have sympathy for her.\nBut even still, just because you experience trauma in life, it doesn't mean that you should bring it up in conversation meeting a work colleague for the first time.\nAnd if anything I feel more for OP, she's having to listen to a stranger telling her that she's the first point of call incase anything bad happens during  her pregnancy?. It's bizarre behaviour.\nWould you say it'd be kind, if OP suggested to Susan that she needs trauma therapy?.", "You have seen 100 people getting inappropriatly close to pregnant co-workers and telling people they know about their pregnant coworker?

The gas and giant bath tub definitely helped though.", "I had a normal birth, an emergency C-section, and then my last came out so quickly her breathing hadn't quite caught up to her.

Women who have miscarriages often offer support to other women experiencing that also. It's not considered intrusive or creepy then either. In fact, a lot of people find it comforting."]}
