You informed Susan about your boundaries which she kept pushing. NTA\n\nWishing you a safe delivery, a healthy baby, and a smooth recovery!", "Susan is definitely a weirdo. I'm feeling creeped out just reading what she said.\n\nIt's probably best she's upset and now avoiding you. If you hadn't said to her that her comments were inappropriate and making you feel uncomfortable, think how much worse she could potentially get going forward?. If that's how Susan is meeting a work colleague for the first time, think what she'd be like after a few weeks lol.", "NAH\nWell done for standing up for your boundaries when she was making you uncomfortable. You did so in a polite way, so you can\u2019t be an AH in this situation. \nI also don\u2019t think there was any malice behind Susan\u2019s comments. If I had to guess, she probably didn\u2019t have a strong support system and didn\u2019t feel comfortable talking about all the gory pregnancy/birth details (and I say this 8 weeks postpartum myself) with her husband so she\u2019s reaching out to you to try and provide you with what she didn\u2019t have. It\u2019s misguided but ultimately kind, so she\u2019s not TA either.", "NTA\n\nIf you're uncomfortable you're uncomfortable. It's not a bad thing to set boundaries. That being said, this makes me curious if \"Susan\" may have had a bad experience and wants to support others. Miscarriages and still births are so much more common than people realize and many women & families just **don't talk about it** when it happens. Pure speculation, but perhaps she just wants to make sure you have someone to talk to through a stressful time. Either way, just because she wants to support you doesn't mean you should say yes to her offer. Solid NTA", "NTA. This was grossly overstepping the boundaries of polite and professional behaviour. Perhaps she was trying to make a friend or bond with you - it doesn't matter, you're not obligated to have an awkward and uncomfortable interaction just because someone has good intentions. \n\nAlso, she is allowing this to affect your work by avoiding you and taking longer to respond to your emails. You should either mention this to your supervisor or say something directly to Susan. \"Susan, is something bothering you? Since we met in the office you've been taking much longer to respond to my emails and you seem to be avoiding me.\"\n\nIn fact I'd mention it to your supervisor anyway, since Susan sounds like someone who might tell others that you are unfriendly/unkind/bullying her.\n\nAnd remember - she made this awkward, not you. Don't let anyone tell you that *you* made things awkward by asking her not to share her birth stories or offer you medical advice.", "NAH i feel like Susan was probably projecting a bit. Pregnancy can be really lonely for some women. My husband just couldn\u2019t comprehend any of what was going on with me when I was pregnant. Other moms were who helped me out. My own mom said her pregnancies were so long ago that she didn\u2019t remember anything. And all women in our office have help each other out right from leaves and day care policies and pumping facilities etc. \u201cMom to mom\u201d is a phrase we use often. My HOD had a long intimate chat with me when I first got pregnant including discussing nursing, traveling and returning to work with children - that chat is still something I look back on and i\u2019m sure that is what helped me not slip into PPD after my first. \n\nThat said, you\u2019re not the asshole for not being comfortable relying on someone you don\u2019t know well. I really don\u2019t see any assholes here. Good luck with your pregnancy.", "NTA. There might be any number of reasons for her behaviour. Perhaps she has some unresolved trauma from her own birth and is trying to resolve it in a weird and clumsy way. You're not her therapist, you're her colleague, and you acted reasonably in telling her so.", "That was completely rude of her. First, the audacity in assuming she's your friend. Second, being through something doesn't automatically make her an expert. Third, does she know this is your first child (assuming it is--you don't say in your post if it is). And fourth, why would she assume that you wouldn't want to wake your husband if your water broke (although to be fair, I don't have any kids, so maybe that would be a reasonable assumption)?\n\nThere are more classy ways to bond without being intrusive.", "\"This is the second time we've seen each other in person but here's what's going on with my vagina\" /s. She went too far imo. If she wanted to bond over motherhood, she could have just said \"if you need anything feel free to let me know.\" She didn't have to go into specifics. NTA", "She *may* have just been trying to make a female fellow mom friend. \n\nShe didn't go about it too well but it doesn't mean it was mean as creepy or mean.\n\nShe may just have been trying to show she supports her coworkers so much and earn points as the most helpful coworker. \n\nshe may have been trying to feel closer to when she had her children.\n\nshe may have a crush on you who knows I don't know what was in her head.\n\n That said if you felt she overstepped you probably did need to tell her, but there was definitely a gentler way to say I feel uncomfortable sharing these sort details with newer people in my life I am very private or something. Or she may just be afraid to get a penalty at work or maybe the boss spoke to her on it? \n\nEither way I feel like clear but kind is usually the way to go, if you can but we don't always do the best choices in the moment, so I am going with no one is an AH in this just some miscommunication and some awkward situations on both ends likely.", "NTA - I don't think Susan is the AH for trying to offer you support, but she is the AH for getting upset when you told her she was pushing your boundaries", "Even if she was just trying to make friends it\u2019s never okay to try and force someone into accepting your good willed offers for anything. Not only that but what mother about to have their first child wants to hear gloom and doom about someone else\u2019s experience? All she had to say was congratulations and if she really needed to mention herself say \u201cpregnancy was rough for me but I hope it goes better for you\u201d or something like that. \nNTA.", "NTA and I think you should let your supervisor and maybe HR know. This was wildly inappropriate as well as creepy bordering on a weird form of sexual harassment. Her response to your boundary is a red flag as well. Cover your ass sister. I don\u2019t get all off these waffling answers softballing her, as well as your mom. This lady is 100% in the wrong.", "NTA. She assumed that she was the only person you knew who has given birth. I wonder if her pregnancy was very isolating for her and again assumed that you were in the same spot. Still, she should have backed off the first time you told her you had it covered.", "You were spot on, NTA \n\nHave a super safe delivery of your little one. How exciting for you", "NTA you mentionned multiple time that you were not comfortable and she still disrespected your boundaries. I am also pregnant and I get the feeling. It's like everyone now has an opinion about the pregnancy and needs to share it without asking. Personnally I would go to HR if it comes to the point that it is impacting your work. Also the detail birth stories are the worst, it should be talked over with therapists, not with expecting mothers to \"prepare them\". In my opinion sharing personnal intimate details without expressed affirmative consent is disgusting behavior.", "NTA \"I am talking to you as your friend\" she's not your friend. She's a colleague, and barely an acquaintance at this stage. She's being weird and intrusive.", "NTA\n\n>Susan was clearly only looking to bond with me\n\nAha - so Susan was being rude. When your mum sees that, why is she calling you harsh? I seriously don't understand", "NTA\n\nSusan is creepy as hell and giving stalker vibes.  Started 3 weeks ago and at the first in person meet she's saying shit like \"I'm not speaking as your colleague, I am talking as your friend\" may want to check her basement... it puts the lotion on the skin or it gets the hose again.", "That is a tad much for your relationship level, or lack there of. You are entitled to your feelings, and you expressed them well. NTA.", "NAH You were \"happy to chat about the baby and the preparations.\"  Susan saw that and jumped right in.  She might have gone overboard, but the door was open for her to walk through it.\n\nWhy is your company not hiring a sub for you instead of off-loading all of your work on your coworkers?", "I'm torn between NTA and NAH. Susan would be wildly out of line in all jobs I've personally had but you did mention you are not in the US so _maybe_ Susan's behavior is not as egregious as it reads to me as an American.\n\nHowever you are definitely not the AH for her to stick to work-related topics. I'm pretty sure every culture in the world has a polite way to say \"mind your own business\".", "NTA. You felt uncomfortable. But I do feel like she was probably just trying to bond with another female coworker. It can be very difficult for some people to make friends at work because they don't read social boundaries well. She might have that issue. Also I don't blame her for avoiding you, she's probably embarrassed af. She probably feels like she overshared and overstepped and she did, but honestly I'd clear the air with her for the sake of your working relationship and just establish a firm boundary that you aren't looking to share your personal life with a coworker.", "No one\u2019s the asshole. I mean you could have phrased it in a different way or asked her about her experience, perhaps she experienced a miscarriage or something else traumatic where she didn\u2019t feel she had enough support, but just approached it from completely the wrong direction lol.", "Reddit is always so extreme in its responses. \n\nYou are NTA but I think your mom is right. Susan is likely not a complete psycho as people are making out, she probably wanted to make friends, had a difficult pregnancy herself and thought she was being helpful. She came off a bit weird but it doesn't seem malicious. Some people are just terribly socially unaware.", "I\u2019m actually going to lean to NAH. She wasn\u2019t trying to be malicious; many women\u2019s spouses don\u2019t want to hear the details, or they\u2019re not very supportive. \n\nDoctors don\u2019t typically warn pregnant women of atypical issues (pre-eclampsia, cholestasis, etc.) and it\u2019s often through \u201chey watch out for XYZ\u201d that it\u2019s even brought up. She may also have been trying to just check in on you as a person but going about it the wrong way\u2014**not that your husband is abusive, OP** but abuse escalates a LOT in pregnancy and giving warnings like she did is a way to gauge that.", "Susan sounds like a busybody who cannot read a room. \n\nYou were not harsh. She needed to be told to back off. How does she know you have nobody in your support system who's already given birth? \n\nNTA", "NTA. She wants permission to act unprofessionally towards you so she\u2019s giving you permission to act unprofessionally towards her. She wants to obliterate professional boundaries so she can bring \u201cthe village\u201d mentality to work. She wants solidarity in a motherhood bond with a virtual stranger. You are not obligated to enable her. \n\nGood on you for protecting your boundaries and not letting her act unprofessionally towards you. I would talk to your supervisor or personal relations person and start a paper trail. She sounds like she\u2019s gonna cause more drama in the future and it\u2019d be good to have paperwork to fall back on if you have to defend yourself.", "Nta very odd. Keep your boundaries.", "I\u2019ve actually noticed this is a pattern with previous generations and pregnancy. My best friend had a colleague tell her that her face has put on weight in her pregnancy- I was appalled for her and her mum said that the woman was just making conversation. My reply to that was that at she should find better topics of conversation. \n\nI think so many women were taught not to question the status quo even though they were insulted left right and centre. And now we\u2019re questioning it and calling it out when people are rude. \n\nOP you are NTA and your colleague needs up learn when to keep her opinions to herself. If I\u2019d have been told during my pregnancy when I was working to call someone to save walking my husband, I\u2019d have hit the roof in anger.", "As a F40 who\u2019s given birth, Susan was being DEEPLY weird and inappropriate. If anything, I\u2019d have gone further than you did and gone to HR.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nSusan overstepped.", "Not at all", "NTA, you gave her a fair and more than polite warning to back up a bit and she kept going.", "NTA but this is something you have to prepare for when you have kids: some women become weird and over-sharing when they realise you have kids. Some women lean hard into the whole \"sisterhood of motherhood\" thing and love to talk about pregnancy and child birth and think everyone who's been through it feels the same. You'll also get a new set of friends that you only know because you have kids the same age, and some will tell you in excruciating detail every gross thing their babies and kids do. I have no idea how to deal with them, I just don't respond and avoid them", "NTA you were totally fair with what you said. \n\nBut don\u2019t turn your back on this woman, reading what she said made my skin crawl", "Maybe having gone through childbirth and sharing my story in graphic detail to other moms (and them sharing theirs to me), but her offer seems pretty tame. She\u2019s right that sometimes it\u2019s easier to talk to someone who has experienced it. A lot of weird and gross stuff happens before and during childbirth, and a lot of that stuff is just not discussed. I didn\u2019t even know about the mucus plug until I was pregnant, and then didn\u2019t even know what was happening when it came out. It helped to talk to others who had been through it. \n\nNAH. It\u2019s ok that you are not comfortable receiving her help and guidance, and it\u2019s ok that she offered it.  You may feel differently after you\u2019ve gone through childbirth, but maybe you won\u2019t and that\u2019s ok too.", "Your mom is correct about the motivation (IMO) but that doesn\u2019t mean it was appropriate. NTA", "NAH It is a bit weird but technically a sweet offer. Just one you have no interest in.", "Susan thought you two were friends. To keep the peace I would text her and apologize for your harsh dismissal of her offer of help and let her know that it\u2019s appreciated, you were just caught off guard and already have your support system in place. She might not be great at making friends and wrongly thought you were her friend. Being nice to her now might save you from developing an enemy instead.\n\nNAH", "NAH \n\nSounds like she had a traumatic birth and didn't go into details, and she wanted to prereach out to you if you needed support. I don't think it was weird since she was only showing concern (but maybe that's because I had a miscarriage before).\n\nIf you felt she went past a boundary for you, that's okay as well. But you also gave people space in a professional environment to have unprofessional conversations. Essentially, you invited the conversation. To stop future instances from happening, maybe you shouldn't talk about it in the office?", "Lol, it is a bit strange. However, I do think she was trying to be nice and bond with you, she obviously went about it in the wrong way, but you cut her to the bone by saying what you said. I personally would have said, \"Thank you for offering\" and went about my day, instead of making it awkward for her. She may lack social skills, maybe have a touch of autism, maybe she is someone who likes to be needed or to help, or perhaps she maybe needed some support when she was pregnant and never got it and she thinks she's doing the right thing by offering to help you. I do think you are slightly the AH for how you responded to her. Sometimes people are weird but they are trying to be nice, and it says a lot about your personality in how you respond. At least she will know not to bother with you again.", "Nta. Report her to HR before she badmouth you", "People are weird about birthing things. Next time figure out how to set the boundary without jumping to \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 so quickly, but also nbd. \n\nCongrats!", "YTA. Even though the person is a bit forward with their intension. The person by no means was out of bounds, being rude, nor harmful. They were trying to be thoughtful and empathetic. \n\nMy wife is pregnant, and she tells me all the time \u201cI don\u2019t understand because I\u2019m not a woman\u201d and that\u2019s fair.

It doesn't matter that it came from a good place, or that there wasn't any malice, ignoring OPs boundaries makes her an asshole no matter what.\n\nAnd then to be so upset that it's affecting her ability to work with OP? Definitely an asshole.", "I'm more getting the feeling that Susan is trying to co-opt OPs event in order to make it about her. No doubt she's told people about her 'pregnant friend at the office'\n\nMight be I'm biased because I've known many people like this who get too comfortable too fast trying to get you to share personal details. In all those cases they went on to use me as a conversation point in discussions with others\n\nYou know;  like how old people do\n\nSo I'm going with NTA, cause I feel like that w\u00e0s asshole behavior from Susan", "That\u2019s where my thoughts went at first, too. But even if that\u2019s the case she is out of reality if she thinks someone who has met her once (and therefore is not her \u201efriend\u201c by any stretch of the imagination) would feel more comfortable calling her than waking up her husband. NTA!", "I think this should be higher up! It\u2019s nice that people have compassionate interpretations of her behavior, but retaliating to someone politely setting a boundary is not right. I\u2019m surprised that I had to scroll so far to see something that addresses the email issue and your advice is perfect.", "yeah NAH", "Your water breaking indicates either a medical emergency (if it happens too early) or that it\u2019s go time. Definitely a moment to wake the other parent.", "I'm leaning towards inappropriate bonding attempts, like a love-bombing situation where someone more fragile and lonelier than OP would respond positively. It did sound very heavy-handed and no wonder OP freaked out. You have your own autonomy and life OP, stay firm to your boundaries.", "And the preposterousness to infer that even if op needs someone who's had a baby with her that she isn't already acquainted with anyone that's she's known longer", "No, that shit is too open ended and passive", "No u CockAss69420", "you are the AH for not understanding what a boundary is", "Look, mother of three here, and Susan was so far out of line it's ridiculous. I mean seriously 3wks and she is claiming to be a friend you can talk to instead of your husband \ud83e\udd2c. So NTA by anymeans.\n\nThat said, my only advice to new mothers is to remember to have a bottle of water, cordial basically whatever had helped with nausea throughout your pregnancy that you can also use to stay hydrated. I forgot a bottle the first 2 times \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd23 and my God did it help the third time. Oh, and don't worry if you forget something in the rush, my hubby forgot something all three times (ok, I was also at fault the third time). Apart from all that, just try to enjoy the moment (well as much as your contraction will allow you to).\n\nI have a couple of stories for anyone that asks directly for them but my default \"pregnancy talk\" outside of my close friends is just what I wrote in paragraph 2.", "I was in a neighbour group \"get-together where 4 women where pregnant with their first child and of course scary birth stories were told. I could see they were getting quite uncomfortable so I said I would tell my story as well.\n\nIt was like this: I woke up around 6 in the morning and felt it was starting. Had a shower and went to the hospital. At 9.30 the child was born without much hassle. \n\nThe others looked chocked that I would tell a non-scary story but I thought they deserved to hear it's not always bad. Lol", "I think it's a weird combo of wanting to be supportive, wanting to be honest, and also forgetting just *how bad* pregnancy is.\n\nTo wit, in our general media, pregnancy is shown as being a bright happy spot with barely any trauma. \"Look at the glowing mother!\" and a few pushes, and now you have a baby. We gloss over the trauma and focus on the positive. Which means you have young women who expect a similar ease.\n\nSo older women want to help prepare the younger and share their stories, making sure they're honest. But after-birth hormones are literally a gaslighting bitch and babies take over so much brain space, that we tend to forget all the pain and how bad it actually *is* that our retellings tend to be more gruesome than we expect.\n\nNot saying that people shouldn't think about how much they share and how it comes off, but I think it explains the phenomenon.", "Imagine if every time you got into a car, strangers felt comfortable coming up to you and telling you about the most gruesome accidents they had ever heard of and offered for you to call them in the middle of the night if you felt anything strange", "People are so bad at discussing anything medical sometimes, I stg. Pregnancy is the most common because it happens so often to so many people, but anything where a doctor is involved in some form, people will end up saying the rudest things without meaning to be rude.\n\nMy favorite is cancer. \"What kind of cancer do you have?\" \"Ewing Sarcoma. It's a soft tissue cancer.\" \"Oh, I know that one! My cousin died from it \ud83d\ude03\" and they think we've bonded now.", "It depends on the country.  In the US, childbirth is very dangerous and women are often unprepared/not warned about what can go wrong.  In safer countries, I have no idea.", "Yep currently pregnant with my first and heard nothing but horror stories. It\u2019s not fun.", "I had someone do this to me while I was working. I'm just trying to ring her up, visibly pretty far along, and this later middle age woman fixed me in her gaze like a snake at a bird and detailed her 4th degree tear and more. With customers behind her, me clearly very uncomfortable, and my manager showing up and clearly about ready to kick her out.\n\nLike it was super obvious her birth experience had been *very* traumatic for her, but holy shit why would you inflict that on a complete stranger?", "thankfully nobody agrees with you ....learn to take a hint", "Ok Susan", "In what way is OP an asshole? When she thanked her coworker for her concern? When she said she had a stellar support system? When stating her boundary and it being ignored she informed her coworker she'd rather stick to work topics?", "Yes, Susan is an asshole", "Susan? Is that you?", "Oh poor Susan\u2026.", "Susan might need a little grace, but her behavior is making OP uncomfortable.  That's harassment and now she's making work difficult for OP. Susan's mental state is not the primary concern here when she makes OP uncomfortable and stresses OP out about her own pregnancy.  This needs to be escalated to HR.", "Why treat Susan with some grace though?. It was the first time OP had met Susan. They're not friends, they're work colleagues. \nJust because Susan might have unresolved trauma from her own birth experience, does that mean it's appropriate to talk to OP in the manner she did?. It's definitely not.\nIf it was me, I'd be worried about giving Susan any of my work projects.", "You think? I mean I\u2019ve heard of this happen but could a bond latch so quickly? The first time seeing them?", "This was my read on it. She's obviously socially inept, likely doesn't have many close friends as a result, and felt alone during her pregnancy. (The line about not wanting to wake your husband if your water breaks definitely reads as someone who did not have a supportive partner.) So she's trying to help OP by providing support, in her mind. However, lacking close supportive relationships in her own life, she has absolutely no idea of the foundational relationship of trust that needs to exist before you can rely on someone, and no idea that trying to form this kind of relationship with a brand new colleague in a work setting is wholly unprofessional. I think OP handled it perfectly, but I don't get \"baby snatching\" vibes, just socially moronic ones.", "You are just making stuff up at this point.", "Like maybe her own mom or someone", "I always feel low key bad describing my kids' births because of how no eventful and dare I say pleasant they were? It always feels like I'm invalidating other women's suffering by saying 'oh mine wasn't too bad'", "I think a lot of people are walking around with a lot of un-processed birth trauma, and somehow THIS is the one space where they are socially allowed to unpack it, despite it being completely counter-productive for the person facing an upcoming birth of their own. We really need a better system.", "This instance happened up in Canada.\n\nI'm all for providing women with open and honest information about birth but other people's horror stories are generally not super helpful, especially unprompted.", "It's never anything helpful though!  When I was in labor I learned that when your water breaks all that liquid was cushioning you from the worst of the cramping, and it hurts a lot more afterwards.  Not a thing I knew.  Useful information to have.  When people told me their birth stories it was always something super horrible no one could have prevented or braced for.  When I talk to someone pregnant I will always say what happened (I was induced, in labor, ended up with a c-section) and ask if they had questions about any of that.  Mostly I'll try to pass on useful info about being in the hospital with a baby or having an infant at home.  Never anything that they can't use to improve their own experience. People need to pass on the helpful stuff!", "Dont feed the trolls", "It is possible to be kind while enforcing a boundary. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying, and definitely not saying it\u2019s required.", "Speaking from bias, as I said  - I've seen it a 100 times\n\nDoesn't make sense for a stranger to be trying to get that personal withal a stranger, unless their prying for info for various reasons", "I had a bad one and an easy one - i always recommend the epidural \ud83d\ude05"]}
