Elise (17), Michael (14), Andrew (10), Rachel (7), and Lily (5).\n\nI have to go on at least 2-3 business trips a month. If I'm going somewhere for one day or a weekend, I invite Elise. I do this because Elise only has 3 classes and her school allows you to do everything online, plus she's the only kid that I trust to be alone in a hotel/wander around the city (depending on the area). I've been doing this since she was 15 (although back then the rule was that she couldn't leave the hotel unsupervised) and she's gone to New York, Miami, Orlando, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, New Orleans, Seattle, Boston, and she's even gone to Hawaii and Mexico for a week during the summer.\n\nI took Michael to Vegas with us in June to see how he did and Elise said it felt like she was babysitting the entire time yet he still managed to get in trouble. He tried to sneak into casinos, tried to buy alcohol/tried to get other people to buy it for him, and didn't do any of his summer school work. I told him we'll try again when he's older but as of now he can't travel with us.\n\nElise and I are going to Europe for 3 weeks. This is the first time I've let her miss this much school but I think the experience will be great for her, plus she knows she has to do all of her schoolwork before leaving the hotel so she won't be behind when she goes back to school.\n\nMichael asked to go with us but I refused. Last time I took him anywhere he refused to do his work and broke almost every rule that I gave him. I don't trust him on another weekend trip close to our house, never mind halfway across the world for close to a month.\n\nHe accused me of playing favorites because Elise always gets to go on fun outings but it's because she's never broken my trust, she always does her homework before going out, and she doesn't go crazy with my credit card.\n\nI'm going away for a weekend again and my wife wants me to try again and see if he's responsible enough to go but a weekend trip is nothing like 3 weeks in another country. He's just not old enough for this kind of trip.\n\nMy son thinks I'm playing favorites and my wife thinks I need to give him another chance so I wanted to get an outside opinion. AITA?\n\nFor everyone saying I need to give him a second chance: I will give him another chance when he was 15, same age Elise was when she was allowed to travel with me.", "created_utc": 1667929991, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yptgpq/aita_for_only_taking_my_oldest_daughter_on_my/", "score": 312, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Michael has proven that he isn\u2019t trustworthy while you go on these business trips. That isn\u2019t favoritism - it\u2019s parenting.", "I would say NTA. You gave him a chance and he was not ready for it. Elise is being responsible and finishing her schoolwork and sounds like she is being safe and staying out of trouble. You gave your son a chance and he has proven to not be trustworthy on his own or with his sister and these are the consequences. I would give him another chance but I do not think 3 weeks in Europe is the best choice. Something closer to home but still fun for him! But that is just my opinion! I think it is very nice to bring any of your kids on your work trips with you so they can see the world as well!", "NTA. Perhaps your son can earn a second chance, but that should be on a significantly shorter trip and one with a destination that's closer to home. Taking him on a three week European trip after the way he behaved on his first trip is just asking for a complete and utter disaster to happen.", "NTA - Three weeks in Europe is an entirely different thing than a weekend trip in the US and something even your oldest didn't get to do at that age. She is older and has shown during multiple weekend and weeklong trips that she can be trusted to complete her school work and behave on the trips. Tell your other kids that at 15 they can start going on trips with you, and if they demonstrate they are responsible (and if work provides the opportunity) they will be allowed to go on longer international trips when they are seniors in high school. \n\nThat way it is clear that it is not about favorites, its about age and demonstrated maturity. It has the added bonus of limiting the number of trips where you are taking more than one kid at a time. Which means the older kid on the trip doesn't get stuck feeling like they are responsible for their younger sibling. You do have to be up front with your kids though that your job may change in the next 8-10 years so these trips are not a guarantee (which sucks, but that's just how life works sometimes).", "NTA - If he met expectations on a weekend trip it does not indicate he could manage 3 weeks. If the mantra is you play favorites, then yes,  you favor the one who can follow through on all the rules. You favor maturity which occurs at different ages.

Should you take him, make it clear it's one strike and he's out, there will not be another chance until he's a legal adult.", "NTA\n\nBut you should give your son another chance.

He is still too young to be left to his own devices in a foreign country, regardless of his behavior on that weekend trip. I tend to believe that he will be on his best behaviour for the weekend trip and get unruly once more in Europe, as in Europe you can't simply send him back. Even if I'm wrong, that is not a chance you want to take. You are traveling for work, and work you should be focusing on. If he wants to travel with you once more, he can start with local trips and wait for another opportunity for an overseas trip to come up, which it will eventually.

The fact that Michael keeps accusing you of playing favorites instead of owning his own behaviors and working to improve them proves that he hasn't matured or learned anything. I would sit down with him, reassure him that you'd love to be able to travel with him and that you're looking forward to the time when he is consistently responsible so that he can join you again. If he asks what he needs to do to show that he's matured to the level of being a trustworthy travel companion, give him examples (owning responsibility for the previous bad behaviors, doing schoolwork consistently on-time on his own, etc) but be careful not to use Elise as a comparative example in any way because that will increase the problem rather than help.", "Ok why not try again on the weekend trip? \n\nAnd maybe don't give him a credit card.\n\nhow else will he learn if never given the opportunity?\n\nalso makes one wonder how else you treat these kids besides differently besides these trips.", "You are definitely playing favorites by the sounds of it.

I'm planning on waiting until he's 15. Also, Elise has the credit card but she was told to let him use it for food. He went out and got some of the most expensive food he could find.

Yes, Michael needs to understand that responsibility and trust is required to go on these trips. \n\nI do wonder if OP is doing fun one-on-one things with the other kids.

It's his daughter, his wife probably appreciates that there's one less head in the house. Doesn't sound like his daughter enjoys babysitting either with what was said in the post so why would her mom want that around when that's all she'd be doing?", "I get it. I really do. My point was that to go over seas they have to be a certain age/maturity level bc it\u2019s not safe. If he\u2019s going by himself he needs to be mature enough and that comes with age.", "Or take him camping on the weekend, maybe have a 1 time a year each kid gets a trip with dad camping type thing.

By the time Rachel was old enough to join, the troop was under new leadership and they didn't do nearly as much. My younger 3 kids don't go to the same elementary school Michael and Elise went to and most likely won't be in the same high school even though they're better because the entry requirements changed sometime after Michael started there.

I'm just a random stranger on the internet so you can totally ignore me, but I think if I was one of the younger kids and I saw my older sister getting to go with Dad on fun trips, getting extra quality time with Dad and then when I get close to the age where I might get to do those things and he goes \"life sucks, too bad, I got a different job\" I would probably feel really hurt and resentful. \n\nAgain just a random stranger on the internet so feel free to ignore me, but may I ask why you never take your wife on any of these trips?

I don\u2019t see your actions as playing favorites either, this is just being a parent. Actions have consequences and this is a good lesson for Michael.

Make sure Michael knows you two can try again when he\u2019s a little older. (Hell, I\u2019d have tried to sneak into the casino too. Which is exactly why I shouldn\u2019t gone at that age either.)", "NTA And just want to say how awesome Elise is that she earned and deserves your trust.", "info how much alone time do your other kids get with you alone besides these trips? because it sucks to have a parent that travels all the time even if it\u2019s for work?", "NTA unless your son can prove to you he can be trusted, he shouldn't be going on trips half way across the world when he is also going to be alone even fir a few hours. I think its a good idea to try again when he's 15 fir another weekend trip because maybe he will have learned. All the Y T A comments don't know ehat they're talking about when they say favouritism, because this ain't it", "Info: does your 15 year old usually misbehave or get I trouble was it unusual behaviour?\n\nYou might want to start the younger ones on smaller trips and start building up their manners/responsibilities.\n\nI hope you are considering that this happened in Vegas.  I mean it's a place full of temptations where even adults seem to have trouble with self-control. Perhaps a place that has less ways to get in trouble etc.\n\nI wouldn't leave a 15 year old in Vegas unsupervised. If you think that he wasn't unsupervised because the 17 year old was with him. Then it makes sense the 17 year old feels like they were babysitting, if you left them in charge of the 15 year old.", "This may be controversial but YTA this is going to cause hatred between the siblings period. When things are unfair in kids eyes no matter if its valid or not it will carry into adulthood if you are willing to accept that then carry on.", "This is giving strong Lolita vibes", "Particularly since Michael is *still* younger than his older sister was when she started going on trips with OP.", "He doesn't have to spend time with him.", "I mean, that \"kid\" is old enough to sign a lease a live independently or join the military in less than a year. If you can't wrap your head around a 17 year old walking outside during the daytime in *gasp* a FOREIGN country (you know, where FOREIGNERS live!!) then maybe you're a bit of a helicopter parent?  \n\nHell, I was working as a flight attendant at 18.", "I don't know how many she's been on off the top of my head but she didn't learn my expectations while on these trips. We talked about my expectations and that getting to travel with me is a privilege that can easily be lost before she started traveling with me. Michael and I had the same talk before Vegas.", "How do I favor her? She didn't go on any trips when she was 14. Michael's 14 and already got to go on one. She doesn't need to go but I think it's good for her to get to explore different parts of the country or the world. Michael will get a second chance but not now. I want to wait until he's 15.", "So am I supposed to not take Elise to make it fair to everyone? Her being old enough and responsible enough to go on these trips doesn't mean I favor her.", "The son broke all the rules when there was supervision,  are you really arguing that without supervision he will follow them?", "Nope try again. Op said he'll give him a second chance when he's 15, the same age his daughter was when she first started going on these trios with him.", "I am going to give him another shot but not until he's 15. Elise didn't go on her first trip until she was 15. Elise gets to go because she's older and I don't have to do much to take care of her on these trips, which is simply not true for any of my other kids. \nI might leave her at home for one of the weekend trips and take Michael but she's going to Europe and I'm not stupid enough to take him to Europe after Vegas. \nShe may be getting into trouble and hiding it but I have life360 on her phone and it's always matched where she said she is, her schoolwork is always done by the time I get back to the hotel, and I've never had to deal with hotel security because of Elise, unlike Michael.", "I'm planning on waiting to take Michael until he's 15.", "I've left Elise unsupervised in Vegas multiple times, even at 15. There's plenty of things for him to do, other than trying to sneak into casinos and get drunk. They could go shopping, try out some cute restaurants, go to the arcade or pool, and watch a movie. The other kids will also get to try going on these trips when they're around 14-15 years old, just like Michael and Elise.\nEdit: to answer your question if he usually misbehaves, he can be a bit of a handful.", "Yes! Elise didn't start joining her dad until she was 15, so I think it's perfectly reasonable for OP to say that Michael can have another chance to prove himself when *he's* 15 \u2013 and if he still can't handle the responsibility, try again at 16, and so on.", "Do you ever spend time with your wife\u2019s son ?", "I agree. He of course deserves a second chance but a foreign country (or several) where he most likely doesn\u2019t speak the language? That\u2019s not the appropriate second chance.", "Yeah nta what you should do is when your son turns 15 try taking him on a trip alone and if it works out go on trips with him instead of your daughter and repeat the process if your other kids want to go too", "You already set the precedent of you favoring her by spending more time with her how often is it just you and your son have a boys weekend. Why is it you have to take her all the time not saying he deserves to go cuz him not listening in Vegas nta on that one but you always taking her on your trips makes him feel you do favor her over him.", "Thanks for answering. In this case I think you are NTA.\n\nTo clarify, I'm meant I personally would not leave any of the 15 year olds that I know unsupervised in vegas. None of the 15 year olds I know would be used to that amount of temptation and freedom.  I'm aware there are things they can do other than get in trouble. \n\nSome kids have it in their nature to seek out trouble while others just have a lack of self-control and aren't actually seekign out trouble.  They two very different types of \"handfuls\", so was just trying to establish if your son falls more into either side.\n\nI was just trying to see how much  weight to put on him vs situational.  If he is usually disrespectful of rules and boundries or getting into trouble then perhaps it's not Vegas temptations and its more a behavioural thing. If he was USUALLY a good and mature kid and Vegas overwhelmed him and he slipped up, I personally feel like thats more forgivable.\n\nEither way, I do agree that the long trip would probably not go down well and I agree he doesn't seem ready for a long trip. Also, getting into trouble overseas can be alot more dangerous, depending on where you going.\n\nHow and if he should get a 2nd chance to go with you in my opinion greatly depends on how he usually behaves and if he can learn from this experience.", "Does OP even like camping though?\n\nI know for me, having to camp twice (or 5X) a year just sounds like sheer misery.", "Why would op want to do that?", "I think its gross how you're sexualising someone's 17 year old daughter for getting worldly experience", "Why do you waste your time doing tnat?", "Yea I doubt he wants to spend time with you that's for sure", "That's why Honduran parents typically keep thier children in daycare until they turn 45.", "Yeah it sucks but that's life - my grandmother was able to take my older brother on a trip to Europe, but by the time I was old enough to go she was no longer in good enough physical health to make the trip with me.  \n\n\nI still got to go to Europe, and I still had a good relationship with my grandmother,  she found other ways to treat me. I'm sure you'll do the same with your younger kids.", "At least your honest about playing favourites. Hopefully your wife\u2019s son stops bothering you", "I do plan on traveling with my younger kids but if I'm not in the same job I won't be able to do nearly as much with them because it won't be paid for by my work.", "Damn you must hate those kids lol.", "He said in another comment that the wife doesn't want to travel with kids and they often can't get a sitter.", "Your son is accusing you of playing favorites because he's trying to get around the fact that you did try to take him on a trip and he broke multiple rules. You need to remind him, he's not invited because of his own behavior and ignore what he's trying to pull here. NTA. Tell your wife that you are not going to give him another chance until after he is 15. Your kid is trying to play you.", "YTA. There is zero need to bring your daughter on every business trip you go on. If you keep it up your son/other children with definitely resent you for it. Especially if you don\u2019t still have this job in the future and they don\u2019t get to go all these trips. \n\nAlso even though your son got caught(I kinda respect the effort) I can assure you your daughter most likely isn\u2019t the innocent girl you think she is. She most likely just hides it better.", "NTA.  He\u2019s not mature enough yet to go, and it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019d be safe given his propensity to seek out negative activities.  He\u2019s using the favoritism argument because it\u2019s the only argument he has.  He certainly can\u2019t argue that he\u2019s proven himself mature enough to go.  But I\u2019d take him on a shorter, domestic trip, both to let him prove himself and to give you a chance to teach him how to navigate in the world.  Perhaps make the arrangements for that trip now.  Also, rather than a credit card, give him a preloaded debit card and that\u2019ll be his budget for the weekend.", "NTA - a 3 week trip in an unfamiliar country with an irresponsible child would be a huge safety concern.\n\nElise is savvy in foreign countries due to the many trips she has been on and she also sounds very responsible and well behaved so would have less concerns about her safety.\n\nMichael sure deserves a 2nd chance but not this Euro trip\u2026", "I would also suggest any trips Michael gets on when he is 15 are US based. Lots of places is Europe are more laid back about alcohol so if he\u2019s going to try and drink it\u2019s less likely to be successful in the US.", "NTA. Michael doesn't seem mature enough, especially for a 3mo trip to Europe. Very valid to bring Elise, as she's never given a reason not to trust her. Ur clearly not playing favorites idk why they'd assume that", "NTA honestly I think you've already favoured Michael too much by allowing him to go on a trip at 14. I'm not saying you should have not given him a chance at 14 but he should have had to prove himself at home to earn that opportunity. It didn't sound like he did anything to prove he earned that trip to Vegas chance.", "NTA. His actions speak otherwise. If he can\u2019t handle it in Vegas, he will not be able to handle it in Europe.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. Not going to Europe is the consequence for his behavior in Vegas. Since Elise was 15 when she first started traveling, it seems a perfectly reasonable conclusion after Michael's display of immaturity that he (and your other children) should not be allowed to travel with you until age 15. Any significant breach of trust should result in a travel ban until the next birthday rolls around. Just state the rules, lay them out, and hold to them. It isn't favoritism to realize that some activities just need a higher level of maturity for basic safety and good sense.", "NTA", "NTA.  Age isn't a factor as daughter demonstrated maturity at the same age.", "NTA for this long trip, but I would try to let him prove himself on some other small trips throughout the year. People make mistakes and he was excited.", "At 14, he tried to sneak into casino, underage drinking, refusing to do agreed upon school work\u2026..He\u2019s not ready for a trip of this length. Your wife is the one playing favorites, he is younger, he has proven untrustworthy on the first trip you brought him on, where daughter filled all of the rules laid out.", "As an oldest child this is a bullshit answer. If the oldest was 15 when she started than the non-favorite answer is the others also cant until 15.", "She's 17 and clearly able to handle herself if she's been to all these places with OP and done everything that was asked of her. Americans (of which i am one) are way too hung up on keeping children tied to their parents. It is entirely reasonable for a 17 year old to walk around in a public area, in museums, by themselves. \n\nAnd her brother isn't even the same age as when she started. He will have his opportunity for just as many trips once he shows he can handle the responsibility.", "And he gets to start with a weekend trip... where he shows he is mature enough to finish his homework and not sneak into casinos and try to buy alcohol.", "Yea there is zero need to take her on every \u201cbusiness trip\u201d with you. If I was your kid I would probably dislike you for it also.", "I think the 15 rule is a pretty good rule, and it can be enforced on all of the children with all of the same rules and guidelines their older sister had to follow. NTA OP", "Exactly. And it's a very good defense against claims of favoritism.", "Don\u2019t have to be camping.  That poster brought up a valid point though.  Brother sees his sister and dad having all these opportunities to bond while he\u2019s left at home.  Does he get similar one on one time with dad?  If not, maybe that\u2019s what he\u2019s really upset about.", "I think while she\u2019s getting more opportunities to travel, it doesn\u2019t really sound like they\u2019re bonding during these trips (which yes, son probably doesn\u2019t see it this way). \n\nAlso hard to tell whether son\u2019s upset about sister being first/only pick to go on these trips in the first place or it\u2019s the countries she gets to go to or he\u2019s upset about her being trusted to be alone or how much sister seemingly gets to bond with dad. \n\nFor myself, at his age, I would\u2019ve been more jealous/annoyed that dad trusts her more and lets her go around unsupervised with a credit card than anything else. And I\u2019m being punished because she \u201ctattled first\u201d and he took her side.", "My stepdad travels a ton for work and uses his miles to take our whole family on a trip every year.  With travel not being easy during covid - not sure how you and your daughter swung that! - he\u2019s saved up so many miles that our trip this year is going to be like 8 people to Costa Rica for free.  Just an idea for your family! There\u2019s definitely ways for your kids to benefit from your current job, travel can be a hell of a perk.", "An acquaintance was upset at pictures of Michelle Obama and her daughters in Africa.  Why?  She said \"because some of us will  never have the opportunity to do so.\"  These lines of questioning remind me of that.  You clearly state you'll do the same for the others when they're old enough and can behave, as long as your job affords that opportunity.  That's the best you can do.    \n\n\nElise was stuck in the hotel all day at the beginning.  And now she's using these trips to check out colleges.  This doesn't spell crazy-fun-vacation to me.  As long as she's not lording the trips over her siblings' heads, I don't really see an issue."]}
