Elise (17), Michael (14), Andrew (10), Rachel (7), and Lily (5).\n\nI have to go on at least 2-3 business trips a month. If I'm going somewhere for one day or a weekend, I invite Elise. I do this because Elise only has 3 classes and her school allows you to do everything online, plus she's the only kid that I trust to be alone in a hotel/wander around the city (depending on the area). I've been doing this since she was 15 (although back then the rule was that she couldn't leave the hotel unsupervised) and she's gone to New York, Miami, Orlando, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, New Orleans, Seattle, Boston, and she's even gone to Hawaii and Mexico for a week during the summer.\n\nI took Michael to Vegas with us in June to see how he did and Elise said it felt like she was babysitting the entire time yet he still managed to get in trouble. He tried to sneak into casinos, tried to buy alcohol/tried to get other people to buy it for him, and didn't do any of his summer school work. I told him we'll try again when he's older but as of now he can't travel with us.\n\nElise and I are going to Europe for 3 weeks. This is the first time I've let her miss this much school but I think the experience will be great for her, plus she knows she has to do all of her schoolwork before leaving the hotel so she won't be behind when she goes back to school.\n\nMichael asked to go with us but I refused. Last time I took him anywhere he refused to do his work and broke almost every rule that I gave him. I don't trust him on another weekend trip close to our house, never mind halfway across the world for close to a month.\n\nHe accused me of playing favorites because Elise always gets to go on fun outings but it's because she's never broken my trust, she always does her homework before going out, and she doesn't go crazy with my credit card.\n\nI'm going away for a weekend again and my wife wants me to try again and see if he's responsible enough to go but a weekend trip is nothing like 3 weeks in another country. He's just not old enough for this kind of trip.\n\nMy son thinks I'm playing favorites and my wife thinks I need to give him another chance so I wanted to get an outside opinion.

Michael has proven that he isn\u2019t trustworthy while you go on these business trips. That isn\u2019t favoritism - it\u2019s parenting.", "I would say NTA. You gave him a chance and he was not ready for it. Elise is being responsible and finishing her schoolwork and sounds like she is being safe and staying out of trouble. You gave your son a chance and he has proven to not be trustworthy on his own or with his sister and these are the consequences. I would give him another chance but I do not think 3 weeks in Europe is the best choice. Something closer to home but still fun for him! But that is just my opinion! I think it is very nice to bring any of your kids on your work trips with you so they can see the world as well!", "NTA. Perhaps your son can earn a second chance, but that should be on a significantly shorter trip and one with a destination that's closer to home. Taking him on a three week European trip after the way he behaved on his first trip is just asking for a complete and utter disaster to happen.", "NTA - Three weeks in Europe is an entirely different thing than a weekend trip in the US and something even your oldest didn't get to do at that age. She is older and has shown during multiple weekend and weeklong trips that she can be trusted to complete her school work and behave on the trips. Tell your other kids that at 15 they can start going on trips with you, and if they demonstrate they are responsible (and if work provides the opportunity) they will be allowed to go on longer international trips when they are seniors in high school. \n\nThat way it is clear that it is not about favorites, its about age and demonstrated maturity. It has the added bonus of limiting the number of trips where you are taking more than one kid at a time. Which means the older kid on the trip doesn't get stuck feeling like they are responsible for their younger sibling. You do have to be up front with your kids though that your job may change in the next 8-10 years so these trips are not a guarantee (which sucks, but that's just how life works sometimes).", "NTA - If he met expectations on a weekend trip it does not indicate he could manage 3 weeks.

Should you take him, make it clear it's one strike and he's out, there will not be another chance until he's a legal adult.", "NTA\n\nBut you should give your son another chance.

He is still too young to be left to his own devices in a foreign country, regardless of his behavior on that weekend trip. I tend to believe that he will be on his best behaviour for the weekend trip and get unruly once more in Europe, as in Europe you can't simply send him back. Even if I'm wrong, that is not a chance you want to take. You are traveling for work, and work you should be focusing on. If he wants to travel with you once more, he can start with local trips and wait for another opportunity for an overseas trip to come up, which it will eventually.

The fact that Michael keeps accusing you of playing favorites instead of owning his own behaviors and working to improve them proves that he hasn't matured or learned anything. I would sit down with him, reassure him that you'd love to be able to travel with him and that you're looking forward to the time when he is consistently responsible so that he can join you again. If he asks what he needs to do to show that he's matured to the level of being a trustworthy travel companion, give him examples (owning responsibility for the previous bad behaviors, doing schoolwork consistently on-time on his own, etc) but be careful not to use Elise as a comparative example in any way because that will increase the problem rather than help.", "Ok why not try again on the weekend trip? \n\nAnd maybe don't give him a credit card.\n\nhow else will he learn if never given the opportunity?\n\nalso makes one wonder how else you treat these kids besides differently besides these trips.", "You are definitely playing favorites by the sounds of it.

I'm planning on waiting until he's 15. Also, Elise has the credit card but she was told to let him use it for food. He went out and got some of the most expensive food he could find.

It's his daughter, his wife probably appreciates that there's one less head in the house. Doesn't sound like his daughter enjoys babysitting either with what was said in the post so why would her mom want that around when that's all she'd be doing?", "I get it. I really do. My point was that to go over seas they have to be a certain age/maturity level bc it\u2019s not safe. If he\u2019s going by himself he needs to be mature enough and that comes with age.", "Or take him camping on the weekend, maybe have a 1 time a year each kid gets a trip with dad camping type thing.

By the time Rachel was old enough to join, the troop was under new leadership and they didn't do nearly as much. My younger 3 kids don't go to the same elementary school Michael and Elise went to and most likely won't be in the same high school even though they're better because the entry requirements changed sometime after Michael started there.

I'm just a random stranger on the internet so you can totally ignore me, but I think if I was one of the younger kids and I saw my older sister getting to go with Dad on fun trips, getting extra quality time with Dad and then when I get close to the age where I might get to do those things and he goes \"life sucks, too bad, I got a different job\" I would probably feel really hurt and resentful. \n\nAgain just a random stranger on the internet so feel free to ignore me, but may I ask why you never take your wife on any of these trips?

I don\u2019t see your actions as playing favorites either, this is just being a parent. Actions have consequences and this is a good lesson for Michael.
