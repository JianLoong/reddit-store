Elise (17), Michael (14), Andrew (10), Rachel (7), and Lily (5). \n\nI have to go on at least 2-3 business trips a month. If I'm going somewhere for one day or a weekend, I invite Elise. I do this because Elise only has 3 classes and her school allows you to do everything online, plus she's the only kid that I trust to be alone in a hotel/wander around the city (depending on the area). I've been doing this since she was 15 (although back then the rule was that she couldn't leave the hotel unsupervised) and she's gone to New York, Miami, Orlando, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, New Orleans, Seattle, Boston, and she's even gone to Hawaii and Mexico for a week during the summer. \n\nI took Michael to Vegas with us in June to see how he did and Elise said it felt like she was babysitting the entire time yet he still managed to get in trouble. He tried to sneak into casinos, tried to buy alcohol/tried to get other people to buy it for him, and didn't do any of his summer school work. I told him we'll try again when he's older but as of now he can't travel with us. \n\nElise and I are going to Europe for 3 weeks. This is the first time I've let her miss this much school but I think the experience will be great for her, plus she knows she has to do all of her schoolwork before leaving the hotel so she won't be behind when she goes back to school. \n\nMichael asked to go with us but I refused. Last time I took him anywhere he refused to do his work and broke almost every rule that I gave him. I don't trust him on another weekend trip close to our house, never mind halfway across the world for close to a month. \n\nHe accused me of playing favorites because Elise always gets to go on fun outings but it's because she's never broken my trust, she always does her homework before going out, and she doesn't go crazy with my credit card. \n\nI'm going away for a weekend again and my wife wants me to try again and see if he's responsible enough to go but a weekend trip is nothing like 3 weeks in another country. He's just not old enough for this kind of trip.\n\nMy son thinks I'm playing favorites and my wife thinks I need to give him another chance so I wanted to get an outside opinion.

Michael has proven that he isn\u2019t trustworthy while you go on these business trips. That isn\u2019t favoritism - it\u2019s parenting.", "I would say NTA. You gave him a chance and he was not ready for it. Elise is being responsible and finishing her schoolwork and sounds like she is being safe and staying out of trouble. You gave your son a chance and he has proven to not be trustworthy on his own or with his sister and these are the consequences. I would give him another chance but I do not think 3 weeks in Europe is the best choice. Something closer to home but still fun for him! But that is just my opinion! I think it is very nice to bring any of your kids on your work trips with you so they can see the world as well!", "NTA. Perhaps your son can earn a second chance, but that should be on a significantly shorter trip and one with a destination that's closer to home. Taking him on a three week European trip after the way he behaved on his first trip is just asking for a complete and utter disaster to happen.", "NTA - Three weeks in Europe is an entirely different thing than a weekend trip in the US and something even your oldest didn't get to do at that age. She is older and has shown during multiple weekend and weeklong trips that she can be trusted to complete her school work and behave on the trips. Tell your other kids that at 15 they can start going on trips with you, and if they demonstrate they are responsible (and if work provides the opportunity) they will be allowed to go on longer international trips when they are seniors in high school. \n\nThat way it is clear that it is not about favorites, its about age and demonstrated maturity. It has the added bonus of limiting the number of trips where you are taking more than one kid at a time. Which means the older kid on the trip doesn't get stuck feeling like they are responsible for their younger sibling. You do have to be up front with your kids though that your job may change in the next 8-10 years so these trips are not a guarantee (which sucks, but that's just how life works sometimes).", "NTA - If he met expectations on a weekend trip it does not indicate he could manage 3 weeks. If the mantra is you play favorites, then yes,  you favor the one who can follow through on all the rules. You favor maturity which occurs at different ages.  Best to you.", "NTA.\n\nThere will be time when he\u2019s older. And if he matures and shows you he can trusted. If he doesn\u2019t, he will miss out. Sounds like great incentive.", "My husband sometimes travels for work. I\u2019m a SAHM who homeschools so depending on the location we may all go. When we travel over seas it\u2019s just he and I if we can find a babysitter. The girls know to go with us they have to be 15 bc I will be with them all day. I don\u2019t want to be watching and hovering small kids while trying to navigate a foreign city where I don\u2019t speak the language. You have to be old enough and responsible enough to travel \u201cunsupervised.\u201d Full stop. Your son isn\u2019t mature enough to fit that bill. Explain to him that he has to prove he is responsible enough and mature enough to be left alone in a new city. Until then he doesn\u2019t get to go. Edited to add NTA.", "NTA - I believe your son has now learned #FAAFO (F\\*cked around and found out) that actions have consequences.  YWBTA if you take him with you on a long trip. But also remember sometimes people can mature and I'd let him know that the weekend ones he gets 1 more shot at, and if after 5 of those, he gets a longer one if available.", "NTA.\n\nAt a bare minimum, I'd wait until he's 15 before giving him another chance (it's consistent with what you did for Elise), but even then he needs to earn that right before he goes. Should you take him, make it clear it's one strike and he's out, there will not be another chance until he's a legal adult.", "NTA\n\nBut you should give your son another chance. Not 3 weeks in Europe, but smaller trips. Set him up for success with short trips.", "I'm gonna have to go against everyone else and say YTA. \n\nDid you ever think that to the other kids it looks like you are playing favorites? How much bragging about the trips does your daughter do to your son? What does she tell him when youre not around? Try looking at it from his point of view.", "It's a maybes Yes , maybes no - you do appear to be playing favoirites if you've been taking your oldest away all the time.  \n\nWhat do you do for your other kids at home - do they get weekends away etc?

It will take him time to earn your trust again and your daughter is getting some great experiences.", "NTA- and I would say to try again after he\u2019s 15 like you did with Elise.", "NTA, your daughter has proven her maturity. Your son has proven he is not mature and trustworthy to go on a weekend trip so no way on the out of the country trip. Besides, this would ruin the trip for your daughter. She will not want to keep an eye on her brother the whole time. Explain to your son that perhaps next year you will give him another chance. Use this trip to make the bond you have with your wonderful daughter even stronger.", "NTA she\u2019s in a better age range for these activities and they should be fun for her instead of her being responsible for her brother", "Nta, you onlynstarted taking the oldest at 15, she quickly earned your trust so you kept bringing her. Michael has been given a chance recently enough that it's unlikely he will suddenly do better to warrant a 3 week trip where he's missing school. \n\nHowever, I don't disagree with your wife that giving him another chance on a weekend or single day trip where he wouldn't be missing much school is a fair request. He can't prove he learned from his mistakens if he's no given the chance to show you.", "Your son needs to prove himself when he thinks no one is watching/he isn't being evaluated. Him following the rules knowing there's a 3 week European trip that hangs in the balance tells you nothing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You didn't take Elise to Europe at 14 either. Tie it to age and responsible behaviour, it's not that hard to understand. If he can show you he's responsible on multiple shorter trips then one day he'll get the long trip too.", "Nta, safety first and if you try it again it would be way safer in a country you already know, and for any replies I may get saying 'oh, well, op doesn't know that city all too well either', you still are more aware of things happening in your own country than a foreign land, some countries its acceptable for a mother to leave her infant outside in a stroller while shopping, in the United States if you do this not only are you a bad and irresponsible parent but cps/dcf will come and take your children and you will end up in jail, something we could consider normal here could get you killed in another country, given how he's acted previously it would not be a safe or a wise choice to take him this long and this far when he hasn't proven himself just explain that to him yeah he'll be mad but if he can prove himself he may have this opportunity again sometime in the future. With that being said OP if you want to show your son and s/o this that is fine by me or just have them watch the movie taken with Liam Neeson same basic concept", "NTA. He is old enough to understand how to act and couldn't listen.", "NTA. It\u2019s valid you don\u2019t want to invite your son on this trip after his previous behavior. He has to deal with the consequences of his actions and behavior.", "NTA. Also, you CAN take your son on this weekend trip, but not to Europe. He is still too young to be left to his own devices in a foreign country, regardless of his behavior on that weekend trip. I tend to believe that he will be on his best behaviour for the weekend trip and get unruly once more in Europe, as in Europe you can't simply send him back. Even if I'm wrong, that is not a chance you want to take. You are traveling for work, and work you should be focusing on. If he wants to travel with you once more, he can start with local trips and wait for another opportunity for an overseas trip to come up, which it will eventually. And by that time you will have ample time to judge his maturity. I won't even call it \"earning back trust\" as much as lack of maturity.", "Nta", "Michael needs a practice run (second chance) somewhere close to home. I do think he deserves a second chance but his behavior hasn't earned him a second chance for 3 weeks in Europe.", "NTA. The fact that Michael keeps accusing you of playing favorites instead of owning his own behaviors and working to improve them proves that he hasn't matured or learned anything. I would sit down with him, reassure him that you'd love to be able to travel with him and that you're looking forward to the time when he is consistently responsible so that he can join you again. If he asks what he needs to do to show that he's matured to the level of being a trustworthy travel companion, give him examples (owning responsibility for the previous bad behaviors, doing schoolwork consistently on-time on his own, etc) but be careful not to use Elise as a comparative example in any way because that will increase the problem rather than help.", "Ok why not try again on the weekend trip? \n\nAnd maybe don't give him a credit card.\n\nhow else will he learn if never given the opportunity?\n\nalso makes one wonder how else you treat these kids besides differently besides these trips.", "You are definitely playing favorites by the sounds of it. Do you do other one on one things with the other kids? Maybe Michael is acting out because he is the stereotypical forgotten middle child? Or maybe you\u2019re a narcissist who has a golden child and a scapegoat? I don\u2019t know how to judge this one because it sounds like complicated family dynamics and not enough information to judge. I\u2019d suggest family counseling since it sounds like at the very least your son needs it", "YTA.  Another parent playing favorite.", "What about your wife? It's odd that you take a 17 year old girl with you on business trips. Maybe you need to step back and take a good look at your relationship with your daughter.", "Perhaps try a different dynamic next time you take you son. You started by taking your daughter by herself with you on these trips, and you did not give your son the same opportunity you gave her, since you took them both the one time you tried. It is understandable that your son feels you are playing favorites.\nYTA, but a soft YTA.", "That's why my wife and kids don't go on these trips. She doesn't want to have to be away from home with them without me.", "I do want to try again but he's definitely not going to Europe. I'm thinking his next trip will be a more boring city with not as many ways to get himself into trouble.", "I will but I want to wait until he's 15 before trying again.", "They don't because they're younger and can't be left alone all day like she can. I always have her get souvenirs for everyone.", "It sounds like Elise is able to complete her classes remotely while traveling. Op says she always does her homework before going out. \n\nAlso many high schoolers complete language exchanges and stay alone with a family abroad", "Honestly the daughter isn't the issue, she has demonstrated multiple times to be mature and respectful. The issue is when given a chance, the son decided to go off and do actions that could have gotten him in a lot of legal trouble.\n\nWhy does this bird go quack, should I put it in with the chickens? You comparing the two makes about as much sense. This is 100% the son being not trust able yet.  Try again later when he has matured a bit.", "she is 17, plenty old enough to be allowed out alone.", "She doesn't need to but I think it's good for her to see new places. Now that she's a senior in high school, she likes to use these trips as an excuse to tour colleges in the area. I think spending 3 weeks in Europe would be great for her and that she'd learn a lot. I'm still not entirely sure how much freedom I want to give her but I do want her to be able to explore, try new foods, and learn about different cultures.", "We will try again on a weekend trip, just not now. I'm planning on waiting until he's 15. Also, Elise has the credit card but she was told to let him use it for food. He went out and got some of the most expensive food he could find. He also decided to get room service and charge it to the room, as well as go shopping at the gift shop and charge it to the room. I had to pay for all of this.", "I do spend time with my other kids but I definitely spend the most time with Elise because of these trips.", "I agree. I'm sure Elise is a great kid and behaves appropriately, but she's getting to go to all these places while the other 4 kids and mom are sitting at home. Yes, Michael needs to understand that responsibility and trust is required to go on these trips. \n\nI do wonder if OP is doing fun one-on-one things with the other kids. If he's traveling so much I wonder when he has time. And taking only 1 kid to Europe for 3 weeks while mom is at home with the other 4? I don't know it just seems really odd.", "How am I playing favorites? Elise wasn't allowed to go on any trips when she was his age. He's already gone on one and he's proven to be very untrustworthy on these trips.", "She doesn't go on these trips unless we can find childcare for our other kids. Why are you making it sound like I'm taking a random 17 year old on these trips? It's my daughter. It's good for her to be able to see different parts of the country or the world.", "This comment is what's odd lmfao, how did you read that and think this is negative to any relationship other than him and his eldest son? It's his daughter, his wife probably appreciates that there's one less head in the house. Doesn't sound like his daughter enjoys babysitting either with what was said in the post so why would her mom want that around when that's all she'd be doing?", "I get it. I really do. My point was that to go over seas they have to be a certain age/maturity level bc it\u2019s not safe. If he\u2019s going by himself he needs to be mature enough and that comes with age.", "Or take him camping on the weekend, maybe have a 1 time a year each kid gets a trip with dad camping type thing.  That way it feels like everyone gets 1 on 1 time with you. \n\nBTW I feel your doing an awesome job with this!", "Can you take him for something else? A monthly lunch? This sounds like a kid who is hurting.", "So you never spend time with them and take them out - even to the park, or cinema or something?  No one says they are left alone but surely you treat them to something?\n\n\nIf that is indeed the case?  Your kids will resent their sister - and you - growing up.  Regardless of age she gets the special treatment and all the holidays and they get a souveneir.\n\nPlease tell me you spend the time with them too....", "Yeah, I removed that from my comment once I realized he said \"She's not allowed to go out until she does her homework\". I misread it that she had to do 3 weeks of homework before the trip.", "I would say depending on the country.", "I do think you are a bit biased here though because you aren't giving Michael the opportunity to even prove himself again on a weekend trip close to your house. I definitely agree that he shouldn't be going to Europe for 3 weeks though.\n\nMaybe I'm just old fashioned, but I don't think your daughter needs to go on every business trip you go on. I can see why your son would feel like you're playing favorites, even though he doesn't know how to behave and has shown you how he isn't responsible. I think he's more jealous than anything.", "I do spend time with my other kids. I don't know how it seems odd. My younger 3 can't miss school because they don't have everything online, Michael has proven to be untrustworthy on previous trips, and it's not fair to make Elise skip these trips just because her siblings can't go.", "YTA. I think it's creepy the way you treat your daughter as a surrogate wife.", "I agree with you 100%", "I do spend time with him. It could also be a kid that wants an excuse to miss 3 weeks of school.", "I do spend time with my other kids. They don't get weekends away like you asked about in your previous comment.", "So far, OP has taken her to various places in the US. Granted, I'm an old fart, but when I was 16, I ran around parts of the US and Canada unsupervised. It wasn't particularly dangerous.\n\nNow he is taking her to Europe. With the exception of Ukraine and Russia (and I doubt OP will take her to a war zone), all european countries are safer than the US.", "And I said in the post how much freedom she gets depends on the area.", "Idk about playing favorites.

That sounds like favoring the son.", "I am going to try another weekend trip with him, just not right now. Elise doesn't go on every trip. I usually don't let her go if she has to miss more than one day of school (summer school doesn't count since it's completely online anyway and she can do it from anywhere) but I try to take her as much as possible because it's good for her to travel and see the country/world.", "I think you forgot the whole \"/s\" here bud", "How do you think I'm treating my daughter as a surrogate wife by allowing her to travel?", "Yeah, I think as long as it's Europe, she should be ok.", "Yes, I read that. I meant if you went on a business trip to Honduras, I wouldn't feel comfortable letting my 17 year old daughter walk the streets alone.", "What about your other 4 kids? Will they get the same opportunity to do all this traveling like Elise does? What happens if you retire or change jobs with less travel before the youngest can go on these trips?", "Why are your kids in summer school?", "I feel like you set Michael up to fail by taking him to Las Vegas on his first trip. I go to Vegas often, and there really isn't much for a teen there except things that will get him in trouble.", "If I'm in the same job and keep traveling, they will get to go on these trips. If I'm not, that sucks but that's life. It's not fair to make the older kids miss out on certain experiences just because their younger siblings might not get to have the same ones when they're the same age.", "Because kids forget a lot of what they learn in the summer and their education is very important. It's only 3 hours per day, they can do it whenever they want (all instruction is pre recorded), and they can break it up into chunks. It isn't the end of the world.", "Elise has gone there multiple times, even at 15 years old, and has managed to never get in trouble. Hotels have arcades, they can go shopping, they can watch a movie or facetime friends or go to the pool or look for a good place to eat.", "> If I'm not, that sucks but that's life. It's not fair to make the older kids miss out on certain experiences just because their younger siblings might not get to have the same ones when they're the same age.\n\nRemember this if you do not have as close as relationship with your younger kids as you do with Elise.", "I can't make my oldest kids miss out on things because my younger kids might not get to do those things. Elise was in a girl scout troop that went camping, was very involved in the community, and went on fun outings. By the time Rachel was old enough to join, the troop was under new leadership and they didn't do nearly as much. My younger 3 kids don't go to the same elementary school Michael and Elise went to and most likely won't be in the same high school even though they're better because the entry requirements changed sometime after Michael started there. It sucks but it's life. Am I supposed to pull Elise and Michael from their school to make it fair? Was I supposed to pull Elise from girl scouts because her younger sister's troop wasn't going to do the same things she did?", "I wasn't talking about school and scouting. I'm specifically talking about the way you keep extoling the virtues of Elise getting all these wonderful experiences while your other kids and your wife are at home. I can understand why you would not take Michael to Europe because of his actions and behavior in Vegas. I'm just a random stranger on the internet so you can totally ignore me, but I think if I was one of the younger kids and I saw my older sister getting to go with Dad on fun trips, getting extra quality time with Dad and then when I get close to the age where I might get to do those things and he goes \"life sucks, too bad, I got a different job\" I would probably feel really hurt and resentful. \n\nAgain just a random stranger on the internet so feel free to ignore me, but may I ask why you never take your wife on any of these trips? Maybe she has already traveled to these places or it'd difficult to get someone to watch the kids.  Three weeks in Europe with my husband, even if he was working most of the time, would be a lovely break."]}
