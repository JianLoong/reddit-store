I was adopted and I can say that it would be devastating to me if I met my adopted parents and they agreed to meet to only be rejected by them a second time in life. \n\nThe initial rejection you live with growing up knowing your bio parents didn\u2019t want you is life king trauma many adoptees have to deal with.\n\nSo I think the mother is doing the right thing in the long run by not reconnecting with the daughter until she knows she wants it and is in it 100% for her daughter.", "But why continuously be upset about it and hold it over my head?", "Because she\u2019s had other traumas and she still tries to victimize herself by talking about them", "I have four other kids besides her. I raised three of them", "No, they aren\u2019t disappointed in me because they don\u2019t care about her", "Well, she told OP. She\u2019s not telling OP anything. Which we all universally applaud.", "Why would she? What have you ever done to be worthy of that?", "You don\u2019t even want a relationship with her so why in the absolute fuck would you have a relationship with her children", "That's really smart of her.", "Good.", "Yeah, no shit.", "Good!", "you dont even have a relationship with her and refuse to talk to her ?? what", "That's her right. For her children to be your grandchildren, you would have had to have been a mother to her. You weren't. No relationship with her children is the normal and natural consequence of your actions.", "The past is the best indicator of future actions based on your past with just ignoring her when she desperately wanted you to be a mother to now having no remorse over doing that the probability is pretty high you'd do that to her kids. She's being a good mom protecting them from you and the trauma you would bring if all of a sudden you decide to ignore them like you did to her.", "Good. Sounds like that is for the best. You don\u2019t deserve to have a relationship with them if this is the way you are acting.", "Yep. And that it was to older family members a few months into the kid's life and not adopted away at birth. Foster placement for sure.", "I agree. It really is.\n\nA lot of the time, I have to wonder if people siding with the parents who do stuff like this have either never been a parent or are shitty parents themselves and don\u2019t get how awful this is.", "Because it was probably traumatic? Have you apologized at all?", "Because you\u2019ve literally done nothing to fix it and it\u2019s over her head no matter how much you think it shouldn\u2019t be", "Because you fucking suck and deserve it.", "Because you have chosen to rug sweep the fact that you chose to not have a relationship with your daughter and continue to do so.  She deserves better.", "Because it greatly negatively impacted her life and you still show no remorse or take accountability?", "You should just let go of it.", "Because it's what you deserve.", "Sounds like she\u2019s not trying to, she is a victim", "\"She tries to victimise herself.\" I can't think of any other word to describe her then \"victim\". You're a shit mother. I hope she never tries to go to you again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis can't possibly be real. YTA.", "\u2026. She is a victim- you do see that right? She\u2019s not victimizing herself she\u2019s just a victim. You are victimizing yourself in this situation- these are two distinctly different things.\n\nAlso that may be the manner in which she\u2019s dealing with these traumas. Healing isn\u2019t linear\n\nAlso I read some of your other comments- the reason you want a relationship now is because you want to see your grand children. You are owed exactly nothing just because you birthed her. You didn\u2019t raise her, wanted nothing to do with her growing up when she tried to form a relationship with you, and don\u2019t accept how you messed up. I hope she keeps those children away from you", "God I hope this is bait because nobody can be this fucking obtuse and awful. YTA.", "Us \"victims\" tend to view stuff like that as something like \"processing our feelings and experiences.\" It's part of being able to move on in a healthier way.", "You see how that's worse, right?", "I feel like you\u2019re intentionally missing the point. Should she be proud that you managed to raise everyone but her?", "\"2 out of 3 ain't bad\" your mental gymnastics is Olympics level", "She probably grew up wondering why you were able to be there for her siblings, and not her. Think about how deeply unsettling that could be for her.", "So out of 5 kids you raised 3? That's not very good odds. I'm surprised she was willing to have any contact with you especially after you say you essentially ghosted her as a kid. Also in comments you sound like you think you are entitled to be called grandma and have a relationship with her kids but that is never a given. You aren't legally or morally entitled to such a relationship.", "3 out of 5? That's not so bad. You're right. Your daughter should get over it. Just kidding. YtA", "That makes it even worse. You raised three and ignored her......", "Would you like a medal? That's what you do when you have kids. Congratulations, you did the bare minimum with 2/3 kids. You need some mental help.", "Who raised the other one that you didn\u2019t? And why were the children removed from your custody?", "Oh, so they're proud of you, and your shitty behavior. Makes sense. You're immature and quite frankly, I hope you find yourself in need of assistance when you get older and she tells you that you reap what you sow. I see you as being on the news in a few years, in a story about a woman whose absence no one noticed until there was a stench coming from her home", "Oh so the whole family is awful got it.", "You really don\u2019t see how completely messed up this is? Every comment gets worse and worse! The best thing you can do for that poor girl is give a genuine apology and explanation, but based on your comments I\u2019d venture to guess that will never happen; so stay away from her. Stay completely out of her life. Leave this poor girl alone and let her heal.", "So, neither you nor her grandparents love your daughter, but you\u2019re upset that you\u2019re being denied the opportunity to love your grandchildren. Unbelievable. She has no reasons to believe you\u2019re fit to be anywhere near children. You abandoned her, and can\u2019t even manage to understand why that hurt her.", "Everything you've said in your comments just makes you sound unironically evil. I hope your other children ice you out of their lives like your daughter has. YTA.", "It you don\u2019t care about her now, she\u2019s not living up in the past.", "Well that says an awful lot about them also in my opinion.", "I see where you got your shit attitude about raising your daughter. Your parents raise you well /s. You literally remind of this woman in a rehab facility I worked in. She\u2019s had fourteen kids, 11 of them in one rehab facility or another, but fuck if she isn\u2019t proud of the three she raised herself. She\u2019s just like you. Doesn\u2019t give a shit about the others she\u2019s abandoned.", "I\u2019m her mother? I deserve to see my grandchildren", "I see some nightmarish attitudes about kids on this website. My best guess is a lot of it comes from people who were treated badly and never examined what was wrong about their upbringing.", "No, i don\u2019t feel like I have anything to apologize for", "How is it bad that I raised some of my children?", "But 60% is passing! She\u2019s graduated motherhood! /s", "She and her sister were raised by their grandparents.", "Doesn\u2019t seem like you are, actually. You might as well have been a surrogate and you don\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d anything if you won\u2019t give any peace of mind to your former daughter", "You deserve as much as you did for your child :) so nothing at all", "\u201cI\u2019m her mother?\u201d\n\nCrazy cause you certainly haven\u2019t acted like one. Cause if you did you\u2019d see why not having you around hurt her and you\u2019d care. But clearly you\u2019re more interested in being a victim then actually trying to salvage your relationship with your daughter. Why would she give an absent parent (that clearly doesn\u2019t actually care about how they\u2019ve treated their child) the ability to be absent in her kids lives? YTA", "You\u2019re her mother? You were absent her whole childhood. She owes you nothing", "No, you are not. You didn't care for her in the past, you don't care for her now. You weren't there for her in the past, you are refusing to make ammends now. You are not entitled to ANYTHING from her. You obviously hurt her and she is being not only a good mother, but a good person in sparing her children from exposure to a person like you.", "It really doesn't sound like you deserve a relationship with either of them. You also don't sound like you were a mother to her.", "Nope. Ya don\u2019t. You admitted outright that you were never a mother to her. Why should she let what is essentially a stranger (you) see her kids? \n\nYou ignored her, now she\u2019s ignoring you. See how that works? \n\nYTA.", "You're the egg donor. That's it. You are not, not have you ever been a \"mother\" to her. I speak for real mothers everywhere when I say you have no business letting that word anywhere near your lips. YTA.", "You are not a mother, you are an egg donor. And of course YTA.\n\nThe difference between kids and parents is kids get to be loved just because they exist, parents need to earn their kid's love. You are not a mother, you dont have grandchildren.", "You are not her \u201cmother.\u201d You have made it clear that you never were and have no intention to ever be. You don\u2019t get to skip out on motherhood and expect to get to play grandma to the children whose mother you traumatized.", "Maybe next time start by seeing you're child. Crying about how you can't see your grandkids when you abandoned your child.", "No you the only thing you deserve is for Karma to bite you in your ass. YTA", "LMFAO just because you gave birth to her does NOT mean you\u2019re her mother. You\u2019ve done NOTHING for her. You don\u2019t deserve SHIT. How about YOU get over yourself. You will never see your grandchildren thank God.", "More like, incubator.\n\nYou are not her mother", "Based on what?", "No, you don\u2019t. You deserve nothing. You\u2019ve done nothing to acknowledge or make amends for your absence in your daughter\u2019s life. You\u2019ve said here you see no point in discussing it. It\u2019s all about *you.* You don\u2019t give a shit about your daughter, so why on earth would she trust you to be in her children\u2019s lives? You actively ignored her attempts to form a relationship with you in the past; you don\u2019t get to pick and choose now and demand a relationship with your grandchildren while still doing nothing to form a healthy relationship with your daughter.", "You deserve absolutely nothing.\n\nYou have 0 rights here and for the sake of those babies I hope she blocks you so far from her life she completely forgets you exist.", "You were her incubator. Nothing you have said indicates that you were ever any sort of mother.   I wouldn\u2019t allow someone like that to be around my children either.  YTA", "You didn\u2019t even bother to see your child! And you want to be welcomed with open arms for the grandkids? As a mother I can\u2019t even wrap my head around your disgusting behavior and unearned entitlement. It\u2019s not the past\u2026it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s WHOLE LIFE. For fucks sake! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been this disgusted in years. You truly are a garbage person if you don\u2019t think you\u2019re the problem here. \n\nGet help. You must be delusional. \n\nAlso, YTA. A massive, flaming, asshole.", "U ain\u2019t no mother. U lost that title at best when she was 9 months old", "No. You're not her mother. You are her egg donor.", "Pucky. You deserve nothing - you abdicated the position of \"mother\" a very long time ago, and laying claim to it now is simply offensive. Your daughter is healthier and happier without you, and so will her children be.", "You do not deserve anything. You haven't been a parent to her and you have been unkind.\n\nYou have to earn her trust in order to see the children and you don't seem interested in doing that.", "No you don\u2019t. You have to have been an actual mother to get to be a grandmother. She doesn\u2019t owe you anything and it would seem they\u2019re all better off keeping their distance", "No, you gave up that right when you abandoned her as a child and again as an adult.", "You aren't a proper mother. I'm glad she's keeping you away from the grandchildren. They don't need a shitty person in their lives.", "No, you are not her mother. You're an egg donor and surrogate, nothing more. You did none of the parenting to this day, so you're not her parent. Therefore her kids aren't your grandchildren.\n\nAs for her stop talking to you, good for her. She did stop living in the past, she moved on from you.", "You gave birth to her and that\u2019s it", "That would make sense if so.\n\nAnd I was abused as a kid by my parents all the way into adulthood by my ex-husband, and I am raising multiple beautiful children of my own. My parents taught me how *not* to parent, and when I was pregnant with my first, I swore to myself I would never treat my kids the way I was treated, and I\u2019m a way better parent than mine ever were growing up.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that some people have such an awful view of children on here. Children are a blessing, and the way they are raised and how they behave says a lot less about them and a lot more about how they\u2019re being parented.", "Then you\u2019re a shit parent and she has every right to be upset.", "You can\u2019t be serious", "You can't be serious?", "Mother of the year right here", "This. Right here. This is your problem.", "You may not feel like you need to apologize or fix anything but you need to let that poor kid rant and let the feelings out. You were shit. You are shit. You are the parent that abandoned a child. Good God have some empathy.", "That's why she doesn't (and shouldn't) talk to you. YTA\n\nYou literally ignoring her for her whole life and not listening when she talks to you about how she feels and how that's impacted her are why she shouldn't even bother. In your mind you did nothing wrong and in hers (and reality) you neglected your duties as a parent. Was it the right decision, was she cared for in ways you weren't able to provide at the time? Maybe yes. But still doesn't change the fact you've put 0 effort into building a relationship with your daughter. You're coming across as extremely self absorbed.", "And t\u0125is is why she brings it up, because she keeps wanting there to be a good mother somewhere in you. Someone who will take responsibility for her actions and try to be better. You are not and everytime she talks to you it is painful to have her belief/hope that you can be a decent human being is squashed.", "Then you're unable to see when you are behaving appallingly. Why TF would she allow her kids (NOT YOUR GRANDCHILDREN!) anywhere near someone like that. \n\nYou did none of the work and want all the pluses. You were an egg donor. You have no rights to her, her kids or their life. \n\nIf you really care about them, leave them alone. They will be better off without a selfish, ignorant, narcissistic, crappy \"human being\" in their life.", "Yikes", "You do. You abandoned her. All you have ti say is you're sorry for not being azure enough to he around when she was growing up and how you're sorry you're still unable to behave like a mature adult", "Wow. Nothing to apologize for? Please get a sense of responsibility. Your behaviour is horrid.", "Tell me you\u2019re a druggie without telling me you\u2019re a druggie", "So you effectively abandoned her, where never there for her in any way yet don\u2019t feel there\u2019s any apology required? And you wonder why she won\u2019t let you have anything to do with her kids. YTA in ways I can\u2019t even express", "You should be sterilized. YTA. Goes without saying.", "Because to her she's the one left out. She's the one you couldn't be bothered to raise. You were apparently able to keep your shit together for three of them, but not for her. That's a heavy rejection she has to deal with.", "Because you actively refused to have a relationship with her, yet managed to be a (supposedly) decent and present parent to *three other kids.* That\u2019s an extra slap in the face to your daughter, because you showed you *could* be a parent. Just explicitly and deliberately not to her.", "You do realise that you\u2019re meant to have raised all of them right? It seems there\u2019s another child you failed to raise? Where is that child? Why didn\u2019t you raise that child? Do you expect them to just get over it too? Conveniently glossing over that aspect\u2026", "Because you \u201cchose\u201d them, and not her", "From your daughter's perspective, it probably seems like she's the one who was never good enough for your love or attention. \n\nWhy are you even in your daughter's life if you care so little about her? It would probably be easier on both of you if you admit that you're not a real mother to her, never intended or tried to be her mother, and will not be a mother to her at any point in the future. You are nothing but a known DNA donor.\n\nAt least with it out in the open, she has a chance to process the truth and move on. You seem to be stringing her along right now.", "Why were they removed from you?", "She has a new baby that I know hardly anything about. I\u2019ve never even seen a picture of the kid", "She also doesn\u2019t really put forth an effort to have a relationship with my other kids", "While I didn\u2019t raise the other child, I have attempted to have a relationship with her", "Because I walked out on them", "It will soon be in the past, get over it.", "You don\u2019t know or want to know anything about your daughter why would you need to know about her kids?", "Because all you were was a uterus doner. You are not entitled to be a part of your childs life. Especially when you didn't even raise her. Go to hell.", "So? She wasn't raised with them. She has no relationship with them, thanks to you. You are the parent in the situation. You don't get to place the onus for maintaining a happy family dynamic on an abandoned child. They are not equipped to be the bridge builder when their very foundation is based on insecurity.", "Why fucking would she when you made it clear she isn't really part of your family?", "Why would she? They were raised by their parents and she was left to the grandparents.\n\nYou seem to have a real issue with empathy, that is a failing and you should seek therapy.", "And you\u2019re wondering if you\u2019re the ass? Seems obvious doesn\u2019t it?"]}
