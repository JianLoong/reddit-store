They say a fight over names is not a good reason to exclude a family member.\n\nYour parents' response to this tells me that they enable Hannah and are deep in denial about how unhealthy her behaviour is, because this isn't just a \"fight over names\". The issue is her entitlement, lack of respect for people and an extreme need for control. \n\nThis is an obsession and Hannah needs to help to deal with that.

Your parents are giving your sister too much validity by framing the situation like this.\n\nFirstly your sister isn't the parent of this child, so she doesn't get a say in baby's name.\n\nSecondly her obsession is unhealthy, and causing her to harass people, including you. Heck, she's even started to develop stalker behaviour in her obsession with gatekeeping the \"proper\" way to name babies!

She was my Girl Scout troop leader when I was like 10 lol", "Pretty sure that's just on the show and not in anything Asimov actually wrote himself.", "I definitely wouldn't expect a 10 year old to be at all interested in a dense sci fi book so completely fair. \n\nI would highly recommend them if you're into sci fi. There's also the TV series that's just come out that I enjoy despite it not being much like the books.", "they sound like rich white people names. when i was a kid i lived in a poor neighborhood and desperately wanted to live in the adjacent rich neighborhood.  i would make up stories in my head where the girls where named with super waspy rich-girl names, like your list above, b/c i associated it with having all the things i wanted.   My name was fine, but it wasn't my name that bothered me.  Is she having some kind of class-conscious crisis here or is she just insane? YWBTA if you let her come to the shower.\n\nETA: If Lyra had starred in my stories she would have been a ballerina with a perfect wispy bun and a rich dad living in the fancy neighborhood. Ie, still an object of envy, but a little \"edgy\".", "NTA, is Hannah autistic like what a weird thing to be obsessed with. I\u2019d go no contact. Life\u2019s too short.", "Hannah needs a goddamn hobby.", "NTA. Your family is so concerned over her getting her feelings hurt but don\u2019t seem to care about the excessive stress she\u2019s putting on you and the baby.  I\u2019d tell your family that her harassment over the name put a strain on you and having her there would be put you both in danger.", "Nta. Sounds like your sister needs to go to therapy over this obsession", "Should also put those parents on the disinivited list. It's definitely their fault that Hannah is the way she is.", "Thank you so much!!! You are amazing and made me smile.", "Depending on the story, it could still work, character has to really roll with it though.", "I kinda wish she\u2019d had a 4th to name Dark.", "Crap I think youre right! its been years since I read it. Must have been getting it muddled up with the show. They are very different.", "Love sci fi. I\u2019d rather read it, honestly. Thanks!!", "Ask your parents why there is any sort of a fight over YOUR BABYS NAME.\n\nPlease don't invite that b\\*\\*\\*h", "NTA\n\nYou're not excluding her over a fight and names. You're excluding her because her \"hobby\" of berating people about names makes her deeply unpleasant to be around.", "I have three kids, 2 boys and a girl. My sons names aren't the ones I had picked out as a kid and my daughter is but I didn't want her name to be that, I had wanted something else but hubby and our boys out voted me \ud83e\udd23.\n\nIf I was related to Hannah, I would have been LC for quite a while and as soon as she went off about the decoy name it would be NC. The forced opinions on names is bad enough but the fact she went snooping is a big no for me personally (childhood trauma).", "Me in my early 20s once was resolved on naming my son Arthas, as in Arthas Menethil the paladin-turned-lich-king.", "NTA  Lyra is a beautiful name, I've always liked it.  It's also a constellation.", "Nta forget the keep the peace family members, you gave her boundaries and shes jumping rope with them.\nHave a sit down tell her since she cant respect boundaries the future kids name is not up for debate and she will not be coming to the shower. Perhaps she suffered trauma from her own name kids are mean and has made it her mission to save other kids who knows.", "NTA. Name choice is up to you and your partner, no one else. Hannah doesn't get any say. Her liking or disliking a name is also irrelevant, it's not her kid. Your choice is a good name. \n\nYou set a rule with a consequence. She broke the rule. Stick to the consequence. \n\nBtw, what fake name did she think you'd chosen? Just wondering if it was also a nice name with no reason to dislike it or not, or whether you went for something super odd you knew would get a major reaction.", "Yes, that's what we think of first.", "If I had a girl I would have definitely used it!  We always liked space themed names, our boy has a total sci-fi name!"]}
