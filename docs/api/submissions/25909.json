My siblings are Dylan (32m), Evie (29f) and Hannah (27f). This post is about Hannah. I'm the first of us to have children and Hannah, while not a mom, is obsessed with names. She has joined forums to give advice on naming kids, anyone asks her opinion on a name and she goes into overdrive and depending on the name will insult the name, the person who wears the name or likes the name and imply that the name should be criminal or she will tell the person how amazing it is and will set the child up for success and be praised by everyone they ever meet. I'm not sure she has a middle ground.\n\nOnce Hannah learned I was pregnant she asked my husband and I about names we liked and whether we wanted her help. I said a very firm no and told her no name will be shared until baby is born and the name is official. Hannah suggested very strongly that this would be a terrible idea. I told her we did not want people interjecting or interfering in the name choice.\n\nThe name my husband and I chose for our daughter is a name Hannah insulted heavily on more than one occasion. The name is Lyra. Dylan's girlfriend mentioned how sweet she thought the name was and how it reminded her of the character Lyra from His Dark Materials. My sister told Dylan's girlfriend that she should learn proper naming procedure and had to be shut down by Dylan because she was going overboard. Dylan's girlfriend isn't even pregnant and there has been zero talk of kids so far so it was Hannah being way too over the top.\n\nHannah pressured to find more info on the name. She pestered me non-stop and accused me of picking a name that will set my child up for a lifetime of shame. I told her she was too extreme and she responded that I could very well tell her the name and let her decide for herself. I told her to drop it and if she keeps pushing or if she tries to find out the name in other ways, she can forget about being invited to my baby shower and she can forget about being invited to meet the baby without a very sincere apology and I will need proof of her understanding.\n\nMy husband and I decided to set up a fake name for her to find if she did go snooping and sure enough, she did. She went ballistic over the name choice and I told her she had done what I told her not to do and that she was warned. My sister said not inviting her would be an asshole move. My parents also think I should still invite her and that I'm blowing this out of proportion.

I can't believe no one has ever told her off well enough to put her in her (silent) place. She has no business ranting at strangers.

Your sister sounds exhausting and violated the boundary you set for her.  Boundaries have consequences.  Stick to it!  Lyra is a gorgeous name!", "Absolutely NTA .... sounds like your sister has some kind of undiagnosed mental health disorder. I'm exhausted just by reading your post, can't imagine what it's like having to deal with her....", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't want Hannah anywhere near me after this. It's one thing for her to give advice about naming a child, but quite another to lose her shit like this over something that is not her business *at all*.\n\n>My parents also think I should still invite her and that I'm blowing this out of proportion. They say a fight over names is not a good reason to exclude a family member.\n\nYour parents' response to this tells me that they enable Hannah and are deep in denial about how unhealthy her behaviour is, because this isn't just a \"fight over names\". The issue is her entitlement, lack of respect for people and an extreme need for control. \n\nThis is an obsession and Hannah needs to help to deal with that. Until she seeks that help, you are well within your rights to not only follow through with not inviting her to the baby shower, but also go low/no contact with her generally.", "NTA. She\u2019s a boundary stomper, and although there\u2019s no cure, consistency is key to managing the impact on you. I would imagine that your siblings and parents want you to roll over because it will make their lives easier (in the short term) but this is your pregnancy, your baby and baby shower. So do what needs to be done to minimise her BS around you.\n\nI\u2019d be fascinated to know why she\u2019s so fixated on this topic and, why Lyra is such a misstep (in her mind- I love it myself)\u2026but I wouldn\u2019t go fishing as it will just give her an \u2018in\u2019 to start in again", "Does anyone know why she's so psychotic about this? Like good gods... Maybe she hates her name?\n\nNta and the wouldn't invite her either. She's unhinged.", "Absolutely NTA. I would seriously consider going LC with sis for the sake of the baby, if this is how she is with names, I don't want to begin to imagine how she'll treat the poor kid.", "Your family is doing your sister a disservice by not acknowledging that your sister has a problem. Has she been assessed for OCD? It can manifest itself in a lot of ways.", "While you're not sure if she has a middle ground it actually seems like she's not even on stable ground ... this behaviour has red flags whirring in the breeze. Why aren't your parents parenting and getting her professional help? NTA and wishing you, hubby and Bump so much love & laughter", "Absolutely NTA. If your family tries to pressure you again, simply tell them your sister's obsessive behavior is causing unhealthy stress during the pregnancy.", "NTA WTF is wrong with Hannah? How many crystals does she have hanging around her house?", "NTA. Beautiful name. Boundaries are set for a reason. This is you and your husband\u2019s child, not your sister. Your sister seems very unreasonable and controlling.", "NTA. Hannah is being disrespectful as hell. She\u2019s overstepping her boundaries. It also seems like she might be jealous that you\u2019re having kids before her.", "NTA. \n\nI have to say you have picked a beautiful name for your daughter. \n\nYour sister sounds very intense and not respectful of boundaries.  \n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't invite her and consider going low-contact for a while.", "Clearly NTA. Why she thinks she gets a say is beyond. No matter the outcome I wouldn\u2019t leave her alone with an impressionable child. No telling what she\u2019s going to tell them.", "NTA. She's insufferable. Don't give her another opportunity to make everything about her.", "My other siblings are on my side in this. It's just my parents siding with Hannah.\n\nLyra isn't classic or old fashioned enough. The name is weird. It's a constellation which means not suited for a name. She considers it made up in terms of naming. I have heard all about what she hates about Lyra.", "She doesn't hate her name but she does hate the names of me and our other siblings.", "She has not been assessed for OCD.", "Totally i agree with you and i think same too dude.........", "That's a her problem. Also so egotistical of her. Do not invite her. Period.\n\nAlso keep her away from your kids. Imagine your kids growing up hearing auntie say she thinks their names are awful."]}
