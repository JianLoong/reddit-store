They say a fight over names is not a good reason to exclude a family member.\n\nYour parents' response to this tells me that they enable Hannah and are deep in denial about how unhealthy her behaviour is, because this isn't just a \"fight over names\". The issue is her entitlement, lack of respect for people and an extreme need for control. \n\nThis is an obsession and Hannah needs to help to deal with that.

Your parents are giving your sister too much validity by framing the situation like this.\n\nFirstly your sister isn't the parent of this child, so she doesn't get a say in baby's name.\n\nSecondly her obsession is unhealthy, and causing her to harass people, including you. Heck, she's even started to develop stalker behaviour in her obsession with gatekeeping the \"proper\" way to name babies!

You can have a lovely baby shower with out her or a ruined one with all her insults and prejudices and what not about the name. The name of your kid is none of her business. She should stop harassing others with her opinion.\n\nLyra is a lovely name.", "It's not a fight over a name. It's the complete lack of respect. I would not invite anyone to anywhere who insults my daughter before even born. Your sister can do one. Good riddance.", "NTA, but I'm curious,  what was the fake name you planted? (Lyra is beautiful btw!)\n\nI would have done something absolutely off the wall ridiculous like Skippy Bojangles or something so that when she came to me like *what the fuck is wrong with you* it would be even funnier to be like, whatever do you mean? It's a family name lmao \ud83e\udd23", "NTA - \"proper naming procedure\"?!    What on earth is wrong with your sister?  \n\nAs far as anyone knows, the only procedure is for the parents to agree on a name.  \n\nHas anyone actually told Hannah that she's an absolute bullying idiot?", "Nope.  You told her there would be consequences if she did this and she went and did it.   Tell your parents that it beyond a name.  It\u2019s her blatant and outright disrespect. You don\u2019t need that.", "I would invite her then print off a big banner that says \u201cWELCOME BABY LUCIFER\u201d at the shower, or something along those lines. Tell her to mind her own fucking business.", "NTA - a fight over names is a silly reason to get disinvited. So why didn't the sister shut up about names because she was warned about the consequences.", "Nta this person sounds positively unhinged and the name you chose is really pretty.", "It\u2019s not about the name. It\u2019s about her not respecting boundaries.", "Proper naming procedure\u2026 TIL   /s", "NTA.  Invite her with with specifications that she is under a gag order and is not to say one word about the name or the baby.  She is an absolute AH and truly not worthy to be called an aunt.", "Your sister sounds like she needs serious mental help. That kind of behaviour is completely bizarre NTA", "100%, being that obsessed over a child\u2019s name is a little bit weird", "I love the book character and I have been in love with the name for more than a decade. OP has picked a great name.", "thank you for this! it has been amazing!!", "That. Is. AWESOME.\n\n(Sorry I don't have enough coins for more than Silver, used up everything, but you are worth it !)", "oh my god you're so cool thank you", "Sounds like somebody on the autism spectrum to me.", "The fake name was Thea.", "Hey now! Don't go insulting our Crystal's! They have nothing to do with the rock head egotistical, selfish,  prideful crazy sister! Our Crystal's aline with light not chaos!", "What does crystals have to do with anything?", "Thea was the fake name.", "I'm just sorry that \"Hannah\" wouldn't work for you as a top pick, lol.  And congrats!", "And it's none of Hanna's freaking business what ops child is named. \n\nNTA op tell your sister to go seek treatment for her obsessions", "Wow. So basically she's a snob who just arbitrarily decides.\n\nI'd love it if you pointed out to her that multiple British Kings were called Edward. Not sure how much more classic you can make a name than hve it be literally royal.", "But these are all just her opinions. She can share her opinion once asked, but she has no authority to force them on anybody. A name is not 'bad' just because she says so. And personally, I think her opinions are ridiculous.\n\nAnd a name isn't a guarantee for success or failure. If a person grows up and has problems, they still can change the name legally or just use a screen name like many artists.", "She just seems like she would be into all the 'woo' of crystals and astrology and whatnot if she's so concerned about names.", "Awww see that's even cute. Your sister needs to understand that she can have opinions, not control.", "I think she'll call them by her preceded name instead of the ones the children's parents have chosen.", "She hates Jamie for being unisex, what she considers cutesy and a nickname, not a formal name. Unisex would be her biggest pet peeve for it, I think, though \"nickname\" and it are pretty close on the reason list.", "I think Winifred was a wonderful [character in the Angel TV series](https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Winifred_Burkle).", "She actually likes Edward lol. It's one of the two exceptions I can think of (Michael being the other) that technically are last names sorta but she seems to let them slide.", "No, not with the rules that the op says.  She\u2019s more likely trying to be elitist and classist.   Did you see the requirements this sister has?  \n\nThis is not a new age thing.  (I am a pagan/Buddhist btw).  You just chose to use a negative stereotype.", "Yes, I love Thea too. Hannah hates it though.", "Oh god. Yeah like that one redditor that found out her in laws were calling her kid by a totally different name because they were angry that she and hubby didn't go with sine weird family tradition of naming their kid Peter or something like that.", "That was a good (crazy) story!!", "I don't know how to react to the entitlement, the lying, their my way or highway mindset, the crazy fact that they think this is proper and normal, etc", "If biblical names are ok for her, then why is Noah not ok for her?\n\nMy logic module isn't able to compute your sister's so called 'logic' on names...", "I love that she likes biblical era names but has an issue with Noah. Her arbitrary rules are so odd. Lyra is a beautiful name though!", "Debbrets will have names like Octavia\u2026so that may not meet with Hannah\u2019s approval", "Noah should be a nickname for something in her mind."]}
