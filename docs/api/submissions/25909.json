Your sister sounds exhausting and violated the boundary you set for her.  Boundaries have consequences.  Stick to it!

I'm exhausted just by reading your post, can't imagine what it's like having to deal with her....", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't want Hannah anywhere near me after this. It's one thing for her to give advice about naming a child, but quite another to lose her shit like this over something that is not her business *at all*.\n\n>My parents also think I should still invite her and that I'm blowing this out of proportion. They say a fight over names is not a good reason to exclude a family member.\n\nYour parents' response to this tells me that they enable Hannah and are deep in denial about how unhealthy her behaviour is, because this isn't just a \"fight over names\". The issue is her entitlement, lack of respect for people and an extreme need for control. \n\nThis is an obsession and Hannah needs to help to deal with that. Until she seeks that help, you are well within your rights to not only follow through with not inviting her to the baby shower, but also go low/no contact with her generally.", "NTA. She\u2019s a boundary stomper, and although there\u2019s no cure, consistency is key to managing the impact on you. I would imagine that your siblings and parents want you to roll over because it will make their lives easier (in the short term) but this is your pregnancy, your baby and baby shower. So do what needs to be done to minimise her BS around you.\n\nI\u2019d be fascinated to know why she\u2019s so fixated on this topic and, why Lyra is such a misstep (in her mind- I love it myself)\u2026but I wouldn\u2019t go fishing as it will just give her an \u2018in\u2019 to start in again", "Does anyone know why she's so psychotic about this? Like good gods... Maybe she hates her name?\n\nNta and the wouldn't invite her either. She's unhinged.", "Absolutely NTA. I would seriously consider going LC with sis for the sake of the baby, if this is how she is with names, I don't want to begin to imagine how she'll treat the poor kid.", "Your family is doing your sister a disservice by not acknowledging that your sister has a problem. Has she been assessed for OCD? It can manifest itself in a lot of ways.", "While you're not sure if she has a middle ground it actually seems like she's not even on stable ground ... this behaviour has red flags whirring in the breeze.

It also seems like she might be jealous that you\u2019re having kids before her.", "NTA. \n\nI have to say you have picked a beautiful name for your daughter. \n\nYour sister sounds very intense and not respectful of boundaries.  \n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't invite her and consider going low-contact for a while.", "Clearly NTA. Why she thinks she gets a say is beyond. No matter the outcome I wouldn\u2019t leave her alone with an impressionable child. No telling what she\u2019s going to tell them.", "NTA. She's insufferable. Don't give her another opportunity to make everything about her.", "My other siblings are on my side in this. It's just my parents siding with Hannah.\n\nLyra isn't classic or old fashioned enough. The name is weird. It's a constellation which means not suited for a name. She considers it made up in terms of naming.

She sounds obnoxious, opinionated and obviously not true to her word. Don't invite her and go nc or lc. Say to your parents and sister the same as was suggested in another comment, it is causing you stress, not good for the baby.  If they still object, say you will be going nc or lc with them too if your sisters invitation is more important to them than your well being and that of the baby.

Your sister needa some therapy.

It's a fight over your sister's behavior.", "NTA, who died and made her the name police? You are allowed to name your child whatever you like and if she\u2019s being that intrusive and obsessive I would be putting some boundaries up as well. Your sister however should be prepared for a lot of people to do the same thing because she sounds like a pain in the ass and no one wants someone judging their baby names. Go live if your life and your sister will figure it out when no I\u2019m wants to communicate with her or share anything important with her.", "NTA. \n\nAnd I think it\u2019s the right choice to wait until baby is born.

Have your baby shower and enjoy it.  Names don\u2019t make a person it\u2019s their heart and what they put out into the world that people appreciate.  Maybe someone should tell her that and she could get off her name kick And work on herself.", "Seems like your sister was jealous of the rest of you and fed that jealousy into hatred of your names.

They say a fight over names is not a good reason to exclude a family member.\n\nThis isn't a fight over names. A fight implies it's a one-time blow-up, or a disagreement between equals. But that isn't what's going on. Your parents are giving your sister too much validity by framing the situation like this.\n\nFirstly your sister isn't the parent of this child, so she doesn't get a say in baby's name.\n\nSecondly her obsession is unhealthy, and causing her to harass people, including you. Heck, she's even started to develop stalker behaviour in her obsession with gatekeeping the \"proper\" way to name babies! This is not healthy on so many fronts.\n\nPush back on your parents, and point out that this isn't a fight. It's you not wanting to put up with constant harassment over a decision that has nothing to do with your sister.", "NTA\n\nActions have consequences.

You have a power queen on your hands :)", "Sounds like a form of ocd.\n\u201cShe should get used to not being around me, or my children because we\u2019re out as long as she is undiagnosed, untreated.

It's a great name, and (I say this with the utmost respect and delicacy), have you ever considered *why* your sister is like this? Is there a reason for this obsession bc it's definitely not normal, has she been to therapy about it or anything? I mean, I get really being passionate about certain things like names but this is a level that I haven't seen before.
