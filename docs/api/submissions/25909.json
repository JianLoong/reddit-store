They say a fight over names is not a good reason to exclude a family member.\n\nYour parents' response to this tells me that they enable Hannah and are deep in denial about how unhealthy her behaviour is, because this isn't just a \"fight over names\". The issue is her entitlement, lack of respect for people and an extreme need for control. \n\nThis is an obsession and Hannah needs to help to deal with that.

Your parents are giving your sister too much validity by framing the situation like this.\n\nFirstly your sister isn't the parent of this child, so she doesn't get a say in baby's name.\n\nSecondly her obsession is unhealthy, and causing her to harass people, including you. Heck, she's even started to develop stalker behaviour in her obsession with gatekeeping the \"proper\" way to name babies!
