If you failed to inform her of their practices and your standard response, you are responsible for not informing your wife.  You expect her to magically be informed about certain bad business practices.  That is not how knowledge works.  You are also quite derogatory towards her, calling her childish, a stupid chump, and \"she's had to fight to get out of contracts before that she had no business signing.\"  How would your wife, an adult, have no business signing a contract?  Not everyone reads people well or understands poor business practices that exist.

I'm picking up on some serious resentment towards your wife. You said she makes good money, and it's her car. If you had concerns about something like this happening, you could've talked to her prior to her taking it in. After all, you repeatedly mention her naivity and her seemingly getting 'suckered by shady businesspeople' before. I'm surprised you didn't try to intervene and belittle her BEFORE she took her car in: seems to me that you have no problem calling her a 'stupid chump' and ridiculing her decision making AFTER she came home.

She's right, you are being a jerk.", "Your wife took the car where you told her to and got scammed by a scam you knew about and didn't warn her about a head of time.

I also added that ***they have every incentive to lie*** because they want to maximize profits\n\nThis is actually not true. Mechanics live and die by reputation. Your car air filter does need changed regularly, at least every 15-20k miles. Rotating your tires does extend their life.\n\nDo you need that done right then right there? Maybe, maybe not. But it doesn't sound like you know all that much about your vehicle or regular maintenance, so I can't imagine you are doing that at home.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You are condescending in the way you speak to your wife and in the way you speak of her. People who come from completely different backgrounds have completely different \u201ccommon sense\u201d and completely different talents and understandings and capabilities. There are plenty of engineers who don't handle in person sales well, plenty of lawyers who can't change a tire, plenty of doctors who don't have good financial knowledge, and on and on and on. The purpose of partners is to balance each other out, share knowledge, work together, RESPECT each other, not for one partner to be well-rounded and excel in all things and the other to act like a disrespectful harpy over $500 when she isn\u2019t perfect.\n\nSo she lacks some street smarts - so what? She's academically sharp and a high earner street and thinks the best of people - if she had street smarts in addition to her impressive qualities, I have to wonder what the hell does she need you for? If you are so good at this and knew your wife might struggle, why didn't you warn her? Why didn't you take the car in for her? A good husband would have. A shit husband leaves her to own devices, makes her feel shitty afterwards and then comes on the internet to complain about her", "I'm sorry.. wait.. so you're saying that you only ever get an oil change and never nothing else and you've never done any maintenance yourself?\n\nI'm sorry but depending on the kind of vehicle you drive there very may well be hidden issues you aren't aware of. \n\nFor example the truck I drive the fuel filter was filthy leading to poor gas milage.

You call her names (and actually called her stupid of all things!), you talk down to her, and you have an incredibly aggressive tone for a disagreement that doesn't at all matter. It's her car; if she wants to be a responsible car owner, she is allowed. She is an adult who can make her own decisions about her car maintenance without being *berated* by her partner. Seriously, why do you think it's OK to talk to her like this? Even if you were right, which you seem convinced is the only possible option, there is no reason to try and impose your opinion on her in the first place, let alone do it by putting her down. You say you're tired of her childishness? Of the two of you, which is acting like the playground bully? Unbelievable. Grow up. YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou called your wife a \"stupid chump\". How on earth wouldn't you be TA?", "YTA. Did she pay for something she didn't need? Maybe, although if you never rotate your tires, you might be buying tires a little more often than you need to.

You\u2019re allowed to voice your concerns and she is allowed to disagree with you. You don\u2019t need to agree on everything. \n\nAlso pretty sure tires need to be rotated occasionally and filters/fluids need to be changed occasionally. 10 years isn\u2019t very long and depending how much you drive and how many cars you\u2019ve had and whether or not you bought new/used you may not have run into these kinds of issues if you\u2019re always forgoing more than just the bare minimum maintenance on your car. \n\n>No matter how many times I give my wife **the facts**\u2026\n\nAll I have here is anecdotal evidence about your experience with your cars.

That's not unreasonable, and there are mechanics out there who operate with integrity.  They're just very unlikely to be the same guys who do services at cut-rate prices and don't require appointments.  If you insist on using these shady guys, then you should be handling the maintenance yourself.  If you want your wife to handle the maintenance for her vehicle, then you should encourage her to find a shop with a good reputation and expect to pay a bit more for service because those guys are going to be turning a profit on every service they do instead of relying on the unnecessary upsell.  \n\nBut YTA because there was no reason to resort to name calling or insulting your wife like that.
