At the stop light I noticed that there was an elderly man passed out on the street surrounded by 2 elderly women. I rolled down the window and asked whether they\u2019re okay, they said they\u2019re fine. However the man looked absolutely shattered and unconscious. I told my boyfriend to stop so I could get out and help give cpr or first aid if needed (I\u2019m a registered nurse). He absolutely refused and started yelling at me that he\u2019s fine. I told him what if he had a heart attack or can\u2019t breathe and needed help?. He said he\u2019s probably drunk and that he\u2019s fine cause he\u2019s with the 2 elderly women (who look in their 80s). I said let me get out, he refused and started speeding instead. I asked him to park and stop to let me out and he wouldn\u2019t. \n\nWhen we got home I started arguing with him that he\u2019s being inconsiderate and I wasn\u2019t convinced that the man was okay. I asked him why he wouldn\u2019t let me out and he said that we would just be wasting time and he wanted to go home. He then said there was no parking anyways (which was a lie because we were near residential areas). I called him a fucking asshole and left his home. \n\nWhen I got home he started bombarding my phone calling me names. I told him that I\u2019m thinking to break up with him over his little to non existent empathy and I turned off my phone. Today I got bombarded with messages from his parents about why I was wrong to yell and threatening him and that he\u2019s very upset right now. He still hasn\u2019t apologised to me. I told my friends as well and they all said they get my point of view but I was too harsh to him.

Also tho, wow. To keep going when you are demanding he let you out. I could never. That's scary to me, and absolutely nothing I'd want in any relationship of mine. That makes it impossible for me to trust them.\n\nAlso, anytime the family gets involved in messaging you on their behalf, in fights like this....well, it's never good. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "> we would just be wasting time and he wanted to go home.\n\nReading the title I really thought it was gonna be a \"it was probably a trap and you need to be safe\" thing.

Anything can be a ploy. You can't go jumping out into the night ESPECIALLY as a woman and especially in a city. JFC y'all", "NTA- once you asked to get out and he refused, it literally became kidnap. He owes you an apology, but know he thinks it\u2019s ok to decide things for you, even if that\u2019s not what you want.", "NTA. Regardless of the circumstances, the fact he thinks it's fine to respond to a request to get out of the car by SPEEDING UP is fucking appalling.\n\nThe fact his PARENTS are jumping up your ass about something that does not involve them is also absurdly out of line.\n\nHonestly, dump him.  His lack of compassion is certainly a solid reason, but the breathtaking disrespect with which he's treated you throughout this is a HUGE deal.", "NTA but your bf is a total AH. Break up with him, if their all willing to bombard you and gaslight you into thinking your in the wrong, then their not worth it. Calling you names is completely uncalled for and getting his parents involved is just pathetic. Might be harsh to say, but I think its true. Best to you", "You're NTA. Run now, run fast from this guy. Not just for that incident,  but from the bombarding on your phone and most of all involving his mommy and daddy to harass you.

That's definitely \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Can we as women stop dating men like this? Obviously you're not the asshole", "Definitely NTA. Just the fact you asked to be let out of the car and he refused is very scary. This is controlling behavior and a huge red flag. Please do not stay in a relationship with this person even if they apologize. The lack of empathy and being willing to leave someone lying in the street just because he wanted to go home is a horrible sign as well. This guy is just plain bad news.", "He\u2019s telling and showing you who he is. Run. My husband was telling me about helping an elderly man get gas the other day. Keep in mind my husband had about 4 hrs sleep over the past few days. As he\u2019s telling me the story it dawned on him that the elderly man said he was going to a basketball game for his 12 yo son. He had dementia. My husband is still upset over missing that. You deserve better OP. Run.", "NTA. Sounds like there's a giant disconnect in values here and I don't understand what his actual issue was, someone needed help and it was within your wheelhouse to provide that out and he gets mad at you and salty.

Him not letting you out is a huge red flag to me.", "Update and I hope you dumped his sorry parent calling ass and better friends that won\u2019t kiss his ass", "Nta. \n\nThat is some red flags and his reactions are bigger ones. \n\nI say drop him like a bad habit, nothing good can come from someone that holds you hostage from providing help to a person in need cause they wanted to get home.", "NTA.

When you went into medicine you made an oath to help those in need. Stopping for 2 minutes to make sure an elderly man is alright doesn\u2019t cost him much. He\u2019s the AH for making you act against your beliefs and not allowing you to help someone in need. If it were a question of safety, then maybe not stopping was the right choice, but he clearly said he didn\u2019t want to stop as it was a waste of time", "Not only that he didn't let you help him, but also he behaves in  such childhis manner by bombarding your phonecwith texts and getting his parents involved in the matter between you two. It's a perfectly good reason to break up with someone.", "So, your boyfriend wouldn\u2019t let you provide help to an elderly man, sped away from the scene, called you names, and when you didn\u2019t reply, he got his mommy and daddy to give you a talking to. \n\nAre these the actions of an adult man that you want to be in a relationship with? Are you proud of how he acted during what could have been an emergency? Are you satisfied with how he talked to you after? \n\nThe truth is, your bf got scared. And he ran. And to over this act of cowardice, he decided to puff himself up by tearing you down. Real man of character you got there. \n\nNTA. You know what to do.", "Ironically driving is the perfect metaphor for the state of your relationship. He is in control, you are a passenger at his whim and mercy. There was no discussion, no understanding, no compromise, it was his way, his way, his way or the highway.\n\nYour will was to get out and help and he sped up to physically stop you from enacting your free will, whats next? holding you back physically in a future argument? , using force to get you to comply and obey?\n\nAnd when the physical didnt work, he has turned to the verbal and emotional, bringing in third parties and pressuring you to obey and comply to his will.\n\nWhat about future decisions, Careers, Marriage, Children?\n\nNTA - think about your future, are you a passenger or a co-pilot?", "NTA, I could understand if it was a really bad part of town and it looked like a setup for a mugging or something.

He could have stopped for 5 minutes and if that was the case then you\u2019d be on your way. \n\nIt\u2019s not like he had anything urgent to go to, he was simply driving home. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re over reacting by being angry, his family blowing up on you for this is.", "NTA.

You don't want this to be your future.", "ESH you can\u2019t tell other people how to be, you have to decide if who they already are is who you want to be with. Selfless service is a huge commonality that my husband and I share. You don\u2019t teach people how to love, you decide if their way of loving is fit for your way.", "ESH you're a bleeding heart and are in a relationship with someone who isn't. You two stopped or slowed long enough to ask if they needed help but were told they didn't. You don't know if the man was unconscious and if he could speak then he has every ability to refuse help. I'm not sure what more you were expecting to do. Your boyfriend is completely an asshole for refusing to let you out of the vehicle just because he wanted to go home. That's extremely toxic and the fact that he doesn't want to help others speaks a lot. You know this relationship won't work so just end it. Don't play stupid games threatening such when it's just hurting all involved", "NTA", "Had too many subclauses and brackets in what I was going to type.\n\nNTA. \n\nLack of moral fiber.

He saw someone that might have needed help and decided not to help. That's actually okay.\n\nBut he also decided that you didn't get to help. He doesn't get to decide for you. Then he took actions (refusing to pull over and speeding up) that actually prevented you from helping. That is not okay at all. He decided he knew better than you and didn't respect you at all.\n\nAnd when asked why he did this his reply was he just wanted to go home. To be honest if his reason was he was worried about your safety or something it might be a bit more sympathetic even though it still wouldn't be right.\n\nThen when you leave his home he bombard you with messages.

Get away from him.", "He does rum to Mom and Daddy to snitch on you? NTA", "NTA. He got his parents involved to yell at you for him, and that tells you everything you need to know. Also, from personal experience I will tell you that this lack of empathy and type of behavior is a major red flag. When you asked him to stop and he started yelling at you vs stopping\u2026 that\u2019s not something you should disregard. That\u2019s not okay. Yelling is not an okay reaction. Holding you in a moving car after you asked to stop is not okay. \n\nYelling back and using ending a relationship as a threat (vs bringing up that this is an incompatibility you\u2019re not able to live with, which is fine) isn\u2019t great either from a communication standpoint, but it\u2019s rough when someone escalates something to that point. You weren\u2019t left with another option here. Someone was holding you in a car against your will, and showing a complete disregard for human life.", "ESH.
