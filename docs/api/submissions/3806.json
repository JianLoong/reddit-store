Then RE2 remake came out which was my favorite game as a kid and I loved it. It was so fun and reminded me why I loved to play video games. So I bought a PS4 and subsequently a PS5. The last system I owned was an original PlayStation. \n\nSince then I\u2019ll get like one game a year and play it thru. My wife (37F) says I tricked her cause I never played video games and when I get one now, I have to finish it. That\u2019s just my personality, she knows that. \n\nThe last game I played this year was HZD forbidden west which came out in like February \u201822. So I hadn\u2019t played anything for 9 months. GoW Ragnarok came out and I was so stoked. I loved the 2018 one. So during thanksgiving break I admit I played a lot. Like 59 hours. I still cooked all the dinners (including a 20lb turkey for our guests) and woke up with our toddler (2F) when it was my turn. I played a lot during her naps and after she went to bed. I didn\u2019t get much sleep but if I went to bed at 3am, I still woke up with her at 6am. \n\nI admit I played GoW a lot. But I rarely ever play video games and when I get one that I really like I want to enjoy it and play in peace without my wife giving me the side-eye. She was all upset saying I\u2019m just so focused on my game; however I\u2019m always focused on everything. That\u2019s my personality. That got me a great job and I support our family.

My husband is very similar with video games. Gets super focused and it's pretty much all he does (outside of work and parenting/household chores) for a couple weeks. But the other 50 weeks of the year he is always around and always focused on me. It balances. A marriage isn't based over a weekend, or a month or a year. It's over a lifetime together.

You are just assuming things here. It's a high priority but that doesn't mean his main or only focus. He wouldn't be getting up and doing stuff with family and his daughter, and cooking thanksgiving dinner if his main focus was the game. Also sometimes it's fine to be really into something. To say his main focus is that sounds inaccurate though. To me that implies that he almost wouldn't care what they are doing. I'm pretty sure if she yelled OP's name or anything happened he would put the game down immediately. Why? Because it's a priority and something he's very into, but NOT his \"main focus\".", "why assume that he isn't already though? The fact he already gets up and does what he says he will, when he says he's going to makes me lean toward the idea he knows what's important. Idky but some people just really hate video games. Maybe it's because it's so easy to do? Half of the comments in this thread demonizing gaming and gamers, apply to almost any hobby.

I am currently playing a game on ps5 that platinum in the game does not cover a few of the different game modes as they have different trophy sections altogether, or any difficulty challenges. So I can platinum the game without 100% completing. He also said he won\u2019t stop playing a game until he finishes it, not that he stops WHEN he finishes it.

We need more info to demonize this. Everyone's saying the wife doesn't get this, but all we know is they supposedly split parenting alone time as evenly as possible, and according to op he does his part.

If it was every night that'd be a problem, but that's just a normal staple of gaming over the holidays IMO. You spend a lot of your day with family and believe it or not that shit is stressful sometimes. It's nice when everyone goes home or lays down to nap or sleep and you can just go in your room and do your thing guilt-free for a few hours. I'm also introverted personally so it is how I unwind.

And thanksgiving break is normally 4-5 days let\u2019s say thanksgiving was a day he played very little and then 4 other days that\u2019s like 14 hours a day playing a stupid game he said he did tend to the children and sleep which means he wasn\u2019t paying much attention to his wife.

Also \"just picked gaming back up\" is a bit of an exaggeration. If nothing else the first game he mentioned GoW came out in 2018, and he mentioned 2 consoles, a ps4 and ps5.
