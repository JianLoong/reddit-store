Then RE2 remake came out which was my favorite game as a kid and I loved it. It was so fun and reminded me why I loved to play video games. So I bought a PS4 and subsequently a PS5. The last system I owned was an original PlayStation. \n\nSince then I\u2019ll get like one game a year and play it thru. My wife (37F) says I tricked her cause I never played video games and when I get one now, I have to finish it. That\u2019s just my personality, she knows that. \n\nThe last game I played this year was HZD forbidden west which came out in like February \u201822. So I hadn\u2019t played anything for 9 months. GoW Ragnarok came out and I was so stoked. I loved the 2018 one. So during thanksgiving break I admit I played a lot. Like 59 hours. I still cooked all the dinners (including a 20lb turkey for our guests) and woke up with our toddler (2F) when it was my turn. I played a lot during her naps and after she went to bed. I didn\u2019t get much sleep but if I went to bed at 3am, I still woke up with her at 6am. \n\nI admit I played GoW a lot. But I rarely ever play video games and when I get one that I really like I want to enjoy it and play in peace without my wife giving me the side-eye. She was all upset saying I\u2019m just so focused on my game; however I\u2019m always focused on everything. That\u2019s my personality. That got me a great job and I support our family.

My husband is very similar with video games. Gets super focused and it's pretty much all he does (outside of work and parenting/household chores) for a couple weeks. But the other 50 weeks of the year he is always around and always focused on me. It balances. A marriage isn't based over a weekend, or a month or a year. It's over a lifetime together.

Watch her sleep??", "And what does your wife, who you said doesn't agree, say?\n\nYou say you played while you would be scrolling reddit, what does she say?\n\nAlso you didn't actually answer the question of how much time did you spend with your wife?", "My husband is a huge gamer. He plays for a few hours every day. I told him that I'm fine with it, as long a singer some time too. I'm 100% an introvert and like to be alone quite a bit. \nSo we made a deal. 2-3 nights a week, we hang out together after our son goes to sleep. Usually end up just watching TV together. The other weekdays, we each do our own thing, so he can play games and I can get my alone time. \nOn weekends, he will spend time with me until I'm tired (usually 9pm) and then he goes and plays his games until who knows when. \n\nThere have been times where I've felt a bit neglected by my husband because he would play video games from the second he got home until well after I fell asleep. And it sucks, feeling like you don't deserve as much attention as a video game. Doesn't me he did it on purpose, just like you didn't purposely mean to make your wife feel the way she does.\n \nBut she has expressed her needs to you, and you two need to sit down and have a conversation about compromises. \n\nP.S. the game isn't going anywhere. It will still be there if you take a day off and spend the night with your wife.\nNow, if you want a full 10 days to play without spending a night with her or worrying about the kid (much like a vacation) then communicate that with her and find some sort of solution to where you can have a staycation or something. \n\n99% of problems are caused by lack of or improper communication between people.", "So you never go on vacations, the video games are your vacations?", "NTA... On the other hand you should try to spread your gaming out into more days.", "Unfortunately we don't get to do that. We should, but we don't.", "Someone else mentioned here, 14.5 hours per day over Thanksgiving. Now that's not just a case of \"she doesn't get attention on demand.\"\n\nThis guy hasn't gamed in a while and it seems like he struggles a bit with balancing that out. I also game and so does my boyfriend but we both expect to do things like watch our show at dinner, visit each other if we're gaming, help out with things, hang out if one is lonely. It doesn't sound like OP is doing that.", "Thanks man! God damn. Exactly", "I was joking\u2026", "This is gold.\n\nI think most commenters are taking this far more seriously than OP.", "Then I\u2019ll add cooking to yours!", "Everything I listed is what I have done when preparing for guests to have a meal in my house. That used to be anything from 2 other people to 12 or more.\n\nI don\u2019t run a restaurant. Nor do loads of people who do exactly what I listed.", "Pretty sure he meant that he would only stop playing a game once he finishes it.\n\nNot, stopping once he is done.", "But it's clearly a choice not a compulsion. He says he still makes time for all his other responsibilities.", "I don\u2019t disagree with that. Not all personality traits are positive. But we both married each other knowing our personalities. So it\u2019s about accepting these and being ok with them is my point.", "Yeah maybe", "OP slept 3 hours a night so he could get in more gaming time, not exactly super healthy. Not exactly binge-drinking, but not \"just good time management\" either", "OP, studies have shown that marriages fail when partners don't go to bed together very often. Going to bed alone, having a partner who holes up away from you and visibly wants nothing to do with you for days on end, only coming out when forced and letting you know that your needs mean nothing to him until this game is done and you're bothering him for even asking, it's really lonely and hurtful", "That's my thought. When the babies are asleep is the ideal time to do the things. Also!....who is to say the gaming hours aren't broken up? I play switch on my 4 hrs (between 2 trips) and when I get home after a long day (FT work and school. It's reckless but I made time", "Because he knows he's been ignoring her", "Not by myself. In the past year I went on one personal trip (my dad\u2019s funeral- my baby was too young so my wife stayed home with her, and a work trip). I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the point though. She has interests and spends time away from me/our toddler and so do I.", "That's not correct at all. 59 hours over 10 days comes out to  4hrs a day\n\nHow did you get 14.5?", "I understand and I think I do need more information from op. I may be a little bit biased because I seen it and experienced it. It didn't matter if I spent the whole week giving her attention, going on dates helping her out and handling my responsibilities. The one day I choose to sit down and play the game most of the day is the same day she decides to have a problem with me playing the game and wants to do something.", "It's crazy how when a man is playing at his partner complains about him playing the game everybody automatically assume you are not handling responsibility or giving her enough attention. Nobody ever takes a second to stop and think on the other side that there are so many people who have such an issue with their partners playing the game for no other reason than they just don't like it.\n\nMy ex will tell everybody I chose playing the game over her. Completely ignore the fact that she cut off all her friends, refuse to pick up a hobby and does not work. So automatically she expects me to give her attention for all my free time and be her entertainment. But how do you win when your partner wants to go to sleep at 6:00 p.m. and wants you to join her to go to sleep as well but you not tired and want to stay up and play the game? That turns into a argument that should have never happened to begin with", "Nope. Not 100% But it can\u2019t be 0 either. \n\nYou need to share your time between things you want, spending time with wife and taking over responsibilities so that she gets HER \u201cme time.\u201d\n\nHow about for every hour you game, you spend 1 hour with wife and take 1 hour with baby?", "Of course you were \ud83d\ude44", "\ud83c\udf45\ud83c\udf45\ud83c\udf45 - sarcastic btw\n\nagreed. Absolutely entertaining reading some of these assumptive comments.", "The two of you obviously get along great and your interactions are kind of heart warming. All the Y T A's on here are dumb. Neither one of you seem like AH. \n\nAlso, sometimes people don't 'get' the game thing. Find her a game that locks her in and the lightbulb will go off and she'll be right there with you. My wife crushes XCOM.", "\n>and when I get one now, I have to finish it.\n\nSo I took it as that once he has 100% in the game he stops playing, but in the comment he said he was still playing. \n\nObv you have saves in the game so you can technically stop unless there is like an achievement for playing the game without saves which uhm there probably is and I would have no clue how long Ragnarok takes since I never played it. But I don't think that's what he meant.", "You said yourself that you didn't get back into video games until after your relationship with your wife started. Unless you also hyperfocus on other hobbies, it seems like your wife married you without knowing about this \"personality trait\" in regards to video games.", "Oh ok. Sorry read your comment wrong. I get what you\u2019re saying now lol", "I agree. I find that I purposefully stay up later just so I have a minute to catch my breath and hear myself think. My husband and I aren\u2019t gamers (as adults) and we literally just talked about buying a system so we could \u201cescape\u201d after a hellish day or have something that brings us joy that is convenient. \n\nCurrently our hobby is playing ping pong in the garage and smoking a joint (legal where we live) after kiddo is fast asleep, but that\u2019s not sustainable. Life\u2019s hard, you need to find joy when/where you can.", "There are interests, and then there are interests that take every spare moment and leave no time for your spouse. Having time for yourself and your interests is healthy. Having those interests take over every spare minute for over a week is AH behaviour. If you want to spend this much time playing a video game you need to frame it as a vacation much like the one she went on with her mom. Possibly even get an air bnb or go to a hotel near by. If you don't, she has every right to expect you to be a present and attentive husband.", "Youre the asshole lol cant you fuckin tell the two if them are just having laugh...lighten the fuck up", "Of course he was joking. He would never actually do that. We have 4 pets and he's great with them all.", "I know it maybe hard to believe but couples do have this type of relationships where the roast and make jokes like this to each other. Honestly, it\u2019s not that abnormal.", "Lol I tried with It Takes Two cause my brother plays that with his wife but she\u2019s just not interested in video games. And honestly, before my favorite game as a kid was remade I thought I was done with gaming \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I read it as \u201cI won\u2019t stop playing this game, until I 100% it.\u201d Not \u201cat 100%, I stop playing the game.\u201d Like rereading a book, vs. finishing the book and not touching it again. Subtle, but big difference.\n\nI\u2019m also not too familiar with Ragnarok, but from my understanding of GOW, they\u2019re a pretty sizable singleplayer game, wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s 60+ hours.", "All good bro. I get it", "Agreed 100%", "Ok but there\u2019s not one person alive that doesn\u2019t have AH behavior. Right? No one is perfect.", "And I say this as a wife of a gamer and a huge reader myself. I can dissappear into books for weeks on end and my husband can do the same with video games. We have both had to find a balance with our activities and our relationship. This includes communicating \"hey I have a new series/game coming out and I'm thinking of getting a hotel room for a few days so I can focus on it. Would there be a good time in the next couple months for that to happen?\"", "I don\u2019t understand where you get \u201cleave no time for your spouse\u201d from \u201cI play a couple games a year and I spent 60 hours over 10 days on console\u201d", "Abnormal? Not at all. Appropriate to play out in front of random strangers? Nope.", "Correct. But, when we find those behaviours, it is our job to work to improve ourselves. In your case by either better communicating your needs and clearing a time and place for your \"game vacation\" or finding a better balance and spreading the game out over a longer period of time. Or are you ok with your wife feeling this way every time you get a new game?", "Sure. But you came to this forum for a vote on whether you're TA. And now you seem to be admitting it's AH behavior, but you just want the internet to tell your wife to get over it???", "Isn't that a bit much though? Physically leaving the comfort of your home when it's something that rarely occurs and yet he's made clear that he is a responsible parent and attentive the other 9 or 10 months out of the year?", "I mean you can\u2019t take everything so literal. I know it can be hard to tell sarcasm on Reddit, but once it\u2019s explained you should be able to relax. Even OP\u2019s wife commented.", "Calm down. It\u2019s not a very serious issue. I compromised to not play as much in a future game but was still irritated that I had to so she recommended I put it in Reddit to see the responses. And I started reading comments of ppl agreeing with me so she created an account to find the responses too. What\u2019s so weird about that?", "I have to disagree. I was married and divorced before and I don\u2019t think ppl change much. Wanting someone to change is a recipe for disaster- hence my divorce. Finding someone that you can accept their faults for what they are works. My wife and I both have faults and we accept/deal with them", "Yes that\u2019s right."]}
