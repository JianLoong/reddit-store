My partner and I were both on the same page that if it ever got to be too stressful we\u2019d say screw it, we\u2019re going to the courthouse. But like\u2026 otherwise it\u2019s just a big party for the people we love. Thinking about how OP doesn\u2019t want his SIL there because of how sick she looks is just depressing. I don\u2019t know their family dynamics but I\u2019m gonna assume if things are otherwise good between them she\u2019d love to be there.", "Agreed, it sounds suspiciously like an AITA a few weeks ago", "Tbh, their reasoning is BS and they would be AHs even if they were paying for everything.", "I\u2019d like to believe I\u2019ll win the lottery, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen.", "Come to think about it, it would be pretty cool, but I don't have time to think of something of putting and change my reply. Lol so just put something you don't like in place of my friend and his/her aligator.", "Because if he paid for 80% of the wedding, he definitely can't afford his own ticket... ya know.... what a favor by OP, how gracious \ud83d\udc4f \n\nOp YTA and a groomzilla \n\nCan't wait to see this on the bridezilla/groomzilla page in 2 days", "Can we talk about how op uses | instead of I, like some sort of serial killer.", "There is something about weddings, that cause people to lose their minds.", "|'m pretty sure man also knows where the capital i is, because the last sentence of the first paragraph starts with It's.", "The post hurts my soul. I would think a homosexual man would understand being marginalized and outcast, but alas we're all humans - irrational beings running around pretending to be rational.\n\nOP isn't an asshole, but an insufferable fool. Lots of 'assholes' in this sub and OP is not one of them. I hope he finds maturity and empathy before his wedding.", "So you can exclude your SIL, but invite family members who would mock someone for their illness? Your priorities are clear.", "Here's a thought - maybe you should prioritize inviting your brother - the guy who paid for 80% of your wedding - over inviting a bunch of ignorant AHs who are vulgar/ignorant enough to make fun of a chronically ill/possibly terminally ill woman. But that would make too much sense, and it would show a certain amount of empathy that you obviously lack. If your future husband agrees with your decision to not invite your SIL to your wedding, then  I think that the two of you deserve each other. \n\nI hope that your future in-laws treat you with the same disdain and disrespect that they are showing your SIL.", "A reasonable interpretation though, since it\u2019s hard to believe you wouldn\u2019t let someone paying for 80% of your wedding to bring whoever the f they want", "If you go to the profile and then hit comments you can see all of OP\u2019s comments easily \u263a\ufe0f", "Yeah, it doesn't click well with me either...", "I feel honoured \ud83d\ude47\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I was going to vote YTA for that alone.", "It's a trick. They tell narcissists to try to use 'I' less.", "I think he and his fianc\u00e9 and his new in-laws are perfect for each other.\n\nTrash meet trash.", "\"I think you should.... oh wait sorry, let me remember what my therapist said and try again. Longbar think you should...\""]}
