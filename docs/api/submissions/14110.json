Your brother actually payed for your wedding and you don't want to include his wife??? WTF. LOL, sorry, but if you are really afraid that your friends and family will make it so uncomfortable for her, you have shitty friends and you know what they says: Show me your friends and you show me yourself.

Seriously, you deserve each other.", " YTA.\nYour behaviour is totally selfish and entitled.  Isn\u2019t the real reason your not inviting her to the wedding is to improve your wedding photos so you won\u2019t have an ill person in them.\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if your brother decides to cancel everything he has paid for and just loose the deposit this point.", "You don\u2019t sound judgemental at all\u2026/s \n\nYTA", "YTA for not wanting Rose at your wedding, accepting his money and having the gall of calling Jon selfish. YTA as well for using | instead of I throughout your post. What is that about?!", "YTA \n\nSILs like you are the bane of many women's existence. Selfish in law spotted yet again.", "Dude!  If you are really that selfish, self centred and uncompassionate, how on earth do you expect your marriage to last?  Please take a long look at yourself and consider a little self reflection.", "Yta.

Not Even fart to your general direction.", "Wow, thank you. You just gave me the most cut and dried example of YTA I've seen on here. Just wow. You're brother that's supporting a possible dying wife, paided for 80% of your wedding, and you dont want her there, because she might steal your day. If I was your brother I'd contest any payments I made for you're wedding, and then completely write you out of my life.", "I don\u2019t believe it any of it. I cannot believe that there is people as cruel, shallow and selfish than your fianc\u00e9 and you.", "You are SUCH the asshole. \n\n| can\u2019t believe you even have to ask.

How do you type all this and think \"maybe I'm being reasonable\"?", "YTA big time. Discriminating against someone so other people don\u2019t discriminate against them is bullshit. And I suspect it\u2019s more about your discomfort anyway. Have you even considered how she would feel about being excluded from an event because of something she can\u2019t control?

If I were him I'd pull out the money and tell you fu## off.", "I think the concept of \u201cmy big day\u201d should die a fiery death.

Why are you not paying for your own? Would you be ok leaving your sick spouse out of family events to satisfy someones ego?", "YTA.. period.", "I was expecting OP to say he didn\u2019t want to invite her because it could be detrimental to her health to travel such a long distance, so I was kind of floored when he said it was because her illness made him uncomfortable. That\u2019s quite a selfish mindset", "You forgot about his selfish brother paying 80% of his wedding.\n\nI really think OP is an unreliable narrator. Nobody is that level of AH and write with that commitment to show that he absolutely is.", "I take it you haven't read the post of the mom who got mad at her daughter (bride) for uninviting her son (bride's older bro) to the wedding. Son groped bride's friends during the engagement party.", "Right, we are willing to buy his ticket, when he paid for 80% of your wedding. Lol  There is no way this is a real story. His brother can bring a 10 ft tall drag queen walking an alligator with a pink dress on and be welcomed because he paid for the damn thing", "Proper use of that reaction meme. Tipping my hat to you!", "Give him back his money anyway because if you truly don't want his wife there then you don't need his money.

You\u2019re an asshole inside and out", "Who TF would do that? Are all your guests bully 8th-graders?", "Don't try to change things now that you've been called out for your & your fiance's bad behavior. You are only worried that she'll steal the spotlight like a true groomzilla.", "What kind of asshole friends do you have that they would make fun of a sick woman? But based on the post you made, you are the company you keep and you sir are an asshole.\nYTA", "I think he thinks that something like that is like a cool personal signature, and not the irritating absurdity it is.", "Even if that would be the case, whether or not to go is a choice the wife of jon has to make, not groomzilla.", "Nah, surely it is. \u2018In sickness and in health - just kidding, if you get sick you\u2019re on your own, ya gross loser!\u2019\n\nYTA OP and please let this not be real\u2026", "She could be dying and you're only concern is attention on your wedding and appeasing your fiance's awful family?

It's clear that neither of you are actually ready for marriage. YTA", "With your complete lack of empathy and understanding I can see why your brother doesn\u2019t tell you anything. And why he moved faaaar away from you", "Because it's painful & *their* business, not yours. If they want you to know, then they'll tell you. \n\nYTA, rude, tacky, & ungrateful for trying to guilt & demand that he attend your wedding in a completely different state without his sick wife! It was already tacky to invite one person in a married couple & not their spouse (since you don't have issues with her. You just don't like that she's sick & you can't know about it.) \n\nHe's paid 80% of your wedding & this is your thanks. If you're truly going to keep with not inviting her & playing the victim, then give him back his money & pay for your own wedding.

Either disinvite the terrible people who would make fun of her & invite her like you should have from the beginning, or give back the money & pay for everything yourself while not guilting your brother for making the *correct* choice by staying with his wife & not attending his ungrateful/awful brother's wedding. Shame on all of you!", "I heard they spend their holidays at the ER, pointing and laughing."]}
