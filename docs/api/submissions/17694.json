It's close to my house and if I leave at 7AM then I'm back at 8:10AM. I need to workout even though I absolutely hate it. \n\nRecently I took in my 7yo nephew \"Dorian\" after my brother and his girlfriend passed away of an OD. I have my two younger sons (Luke -16) and (Matthew - 19) living with me. They understand that they have to help out with Dorian. \n\nI told Luke that I need him to get Dorian ready for school during the time that I am at the gym. That means waking him up, getting him dressed and feeding him. Then I come home, shower and walk Dorian to school. It's quite simple yet Luke keeps screwing things up.\n\nFor example, Dorian almost went to school with no underwear and another time in crocs. There times when he didn't brush his teeth or eat. It really pisses me off. I asked Luke if he was purposely fucking up thinking that I'd give up my workouts so he does not get mildly inconvenient. He said no. I said get it right or I will just ground your ass. \n\nHe started arguing with me about why I can't do this stuff and I explained that I'm too busy during the day working and I'm not breaking my back when Luke can help out. I said that come summer time Matt is going to be doing what you're doing PLUS taking Dorian to camp. Matt already helps out with Dorian's nighttime routine of giving him a bath and putting him to bed a few times a week. \n\nI said that if Daddy can't workout, then Daddy will be Crabby Daddy and he will ground you so fast that it will make your head spin.", "created_utc": 1684536260, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ma8q4/aita_for_grounding_my_son_because_i_cant_work_out/", "score": 801, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Go to the gym a little earlier so that YOU can be home to supervise breakfast, and have grab and go options in case Dorian needs to eat on the way to school.  \n\nYou're quick to chastise Luke, but YOU, the adult and actual parent/guardian here, haven't taken any of the very easy steps to resolve this problem either.  Maybe you should ground yourself until your family is into a better routine, and then you can have your gym time again.", "Crabby daddy needs to get his priorities straight and stop offloading all the work he should be doing onto his kids.\n\nYta", "YTA, so you make kids parent other kids because you want to go to gym.\n\n Do you know how insane you sound?", "YTA. He's 16... he has to get himself ready for school in the morning too. And he's a teenager with a teenage brain. He doesn't have the presence of mind an adult has. You are expecting a lot of him. Can't you work out in the evening? Or, if it absolutely has to be the morning, maybe earlier?", "YTA....you took in a young kid. That means as a parent YOU have to change your routine. You don't make your kids be the parent.", ">I said that if Daddy can't workout, then Daddy will be Crabby Daddy and he will ground you so fast that it will make your head spin.\n\nYTA Daddy needs to be a parent and he can work out after he gets off work. It's not your son's responsibility to parent a child you brought into your home. It's your responsibility to get your minor children ready in the morning.", "Yta \nIt a 16yo should not out of the blue be in charge of another childs morning routine - especially a child whos emotional needs are going to complex after losing two parents. Children often act out under such circumstances. \n\nYou took in the child not your teens. Matt is an adult so this is slightly different but even then he did not take in a child. \nI feel for you that you had to take the child in due to tragic circumstances but that was still your choice.\n\nWhile its appropriate for them to be helping with chores and perhaps small things like getting breakfast ready or helping cooking and cleaning they should not be taking charge of the entire morning or evening routine.\nIf he has said hes not messing up on purpose hes likely not lying. Getting a 7yo to do what you want is hard enough when their whole life hasnt recently changed. Many children regress after the loss of a parent... especially both so its not as simple as helping a kid get dressed. \n\nAnd then having the other child do the night time routine?! What exactly are you doing? \"Not breaking your back\" by using your kids. Sorry but yta bigtime in my opinion. \n\nParentification is psychological abuse and youre on your way there \n\nGet up earlier and work out outside the gym some days. Be a parent.", "YTA. Dorian is not your sons' responsibility. You took him in, you need to fix your schedule to make it work. You are the adult. It's your job to care for the 7yo. \n\n\"Helping out\" doesn't involve all morning care and giving him a bath and putting him to bed! Way to push off responsibility.", "YTA maybe Luke is getting it wrong because Luke is not an adult and should not be parentified so \"crabby daddy\" can have a workout.\n\nYOU took in the child. YOU solely are responsible for him, not a pair of teens. They should not be responsible for his care, that is YOUR JOB. Crabby daddy needs to move his workout to a more convenient time. \n\nA teen boy isn't going to look at crocs and think \"That's not the right shoes for school.\" He's going to go \"Wearing shoes. Good. He's sorted.\"\n\n>Matt already helps out with Dorian's nighttime routine of giving him a bath and putting him to bed a few times a week. \n\nSo far, you walk Dorian to school is all you've indicated you do.

That means you need to commit to taking care of him, not pawn that responsibility off on your sons.

You need to *work around* the new responsibilities you agreed to take on, not expect all three of these boys to fit into your time schedule.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have the time and commitment that Dorian needs, then were you really the best option for a caretaker he had?", ">I said that if Daddy can't workout, then Daddy will be Crabby Daddy and he will ground you so fast that it will make your head spin. \n\nI hope your gym membership is revoked. \n\nYTA", "YTA- your children are NOT built in babysitters/parents.

You are still obliged to allow Luke to enjoy the last few years of childhood. You are obliged to be around for Dorian, to talk to him about how school is going, help him with establishing routines, to help him with through his grief, to help him become a good, balanced adult. That requires YOUR TIME spent one on one with him. You also owe Luke and Matthew one on one time to talk about how school/college/work is going, help them deal with their grief, to help them become good, balanced adults. It's literally your job as parent to make time to make that work.\n\nLuke is not Dorian's parent or guardian. That's your job now. This has shown that you have got some serious gaps in how good a parent you're being. I'm sorry, that's always an embarrassing thing to find out, but now you know. So now you can start being a better parent, to all of them.", "YTA stop parentifying your children. Getting a small child, who's likely traumatized and struggling ready for school is a lot of work. That's a parents job not siblings. Find a different gym time. That's pure selfishness.", "YTA. Google 'parentification' because you're on a slippery slope.\n\nUltimately you chose to take Dorian in - admirable - and that means YOU are responsible for his care. Not your sons.

It's not your son's job to manage your moods. I can appreciate that taking your nephew in has no doubt presented all kinds of challenges. But it's not Luke's job. He's 16, for crying out loud!

Because you\u2019re being a real Crabby Asshole.", "You forgot to include the part where Luke agreed to help so you could retain your workout schedule.\n\nUnless he didn't?
