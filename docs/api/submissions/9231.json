If you can\u2019t do that and agree on appropriate arrangements when your kid is over, then you shouldn\u2019t be with this person. \n\nIf you can do that and he shows he values you and your child, then that\u2019s a good sign. But that also requires action and maintained behaviour - not just words or trying or stopping after you stop complaining. \n\nIt\u2019s easier to make yourself believe someone\u2019s just dense or oblivious than acknowledging they just don\u2019t respect you enough to bother listening or taking any action that\u2019s inconvenient to them.", "Having them in his \"chillroom\" will also protect his poster from harm if your child or visiting children become rowdy and accidentally harm the poster.  If he cares so much about them he should protect them from visitors & children.\n\nDo you both co-own the home or is it yours or his?", "Explain what?", "We have some movie posters as well. And some comic books. Our house is decorated in midcentury nerd. But I wouldn\u2019t dream of putting up anything that would give a child nightmares, and that\u2019s where OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is utterly failing. I would be reconsidering the entire relationship.", "Framed is the operative word here.", "Then NTA. Have your fianc\u00e9 put them up when she\u2019s not there.", "It's my father's property he rents to us with an option to buy later on down the road if things work out well. \n\nI lived here for about 4 yrs by myself w/ my daughter or with roommates before we met.", "IT's ok Jessie, Jason won't come out of the poster and kill you I promise he only kills naughty kids and it's fake I promise wait no don't cry don't cry to mom please-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust take the damn posters down what if lil Jessie stays at moms and accidentally ruins a poster because theyre in the LIVING room..?", "Agreed, the horror movie stuff needs to go if there's a kid around. \n\nFortunately my four year old isn't going to be traumitized by my framed Chuck poster, so I get to keep my nerdy shit around. I did have to find another space for my Funko Deathclaw figure though, since that freaked her out for awhile.", "Okay thanks Tony Snark.\n\nYour comment, the one I replied to, says \n\n>But paper movie posters on a wall is a non-starter\n\nYou didn't add any conditions on that, it seemed pretty absolute, so I thought I'd add a little something as a counter-point.", "How much is really your space? If most of the house has his hobbies in it, seems a far bit skewed. He's got a chill room, gym, his things in the living room. So your left with what? The kitchen?\n\nYou got a adult teenager as your partner. And he's claimed most of the house. He is jeopardizing your custody at this point. Community spaces must be child friendly. One day your daughter will have a phone and show her dad exactly how he lives and decorates.", "I\u2019m agreeing with you!\n\n\nBut I will gladly accept the Tony Snark monicker.", "Oh.\n\nWell, apologies for my sarcasm then, though it appears to have turned out well."]}
