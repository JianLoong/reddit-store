I am a 19F dating a 29M.

Prior to the test we had a conversation that discussed our trauma and we both cried for a couple minutes. He got up to go use the bathroom. I waited for him for a couple minutes. When I did not see him come back I ended up going to the restroom and he wasn't there. He was talking to his roommates which is fine but kind of annoyed me since we had a heart to heart and he just walked off. He also promised that was all he was going to do.\n\nMy puppy needed to go outside. He was in the living room drinking. It was odd to me that one minute me and him could be having an important conversation and the next he could be drinking. I asked him to help me walk the puppy and he agreed. I walked outside and took the puppy and waited for him. He did not come out. It was about 15 minutes when I started heading inside that he decided to come outside to go smoke. I was getting really frustrated with him.\n\nAfter He finished his cigarette we walked back into the house and he started to immediately go back to talking to them and getting high. I reminded him that I need to sleep tonight because I need to go into work early tomorrow. He nodded and I started to head back to the bedroom. He wasn't following. He put the puppy down so that the roommates could pet her. Now, here is where I agree, I messed up, I didn't notice it but I apparently stormed into the room and whispered to him that I need sleep. He loudly started responding with, \"you are whispering now you have to tell them what you are saying or they will be concerned. I said I need to put this jacket up and go to sleep, didn't I?\" The roommates agreed that he said that. I got embarrassed and left the room and waited for him in our room. He said that was a narcissistic test and I had failed it. I reminded him that he promised me that we would sleep early and that when he left we were to continue talking but he said I lost the trust of his roommates. I know I should not have put him on the spot like that but things kept adding on and on.\n\nI never thought I was a narcissistic person. If I am, I want to genuinely get help for it. I do not have jealousy of his roommates. I was a little agitated. He was shirtless in front of them but nothing else. The only reason I was so upset was because he kept promising me things and we ended up not having time for. I have not been feeling well and really was looking forward to going to sleep early. I got no sleep because we just argued all night over the stupid test I believe was meant for me to fail. He purposely upset me and then used it against me. Should I have handled it better? Yes but I do not think what he did was fair to me.
