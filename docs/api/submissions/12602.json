I adored her, but plans had to be remade and I got pissed.

It\u2019s a great chance for both you and your in laws to have conversations with him about how we can be flexible and in dealing with disappointment. \n\nAlso. This is probably him just acting out on not having full attention of the adults anymore. He\u2019s jealous and doesn\u2019t know how to place that. As the adults in his life, it will be important in the upcoming days to show how he is important to y\u2019all and spend some quality time with him as you can. I know he\u2019s not your child.

Johnny is very clearly struggling with feeling a lack of care, which sounds like he was depending on you emotionally. That's not innately a bad thing but it does mean his parents should be providing him more emotional support to help transition to no longer being your \"most important kid\"", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re exhausted, understandably. Things happen and we need to adjust.

You have a lot on your plate taking care of your baby and your nephew, and it's okay to need rest sometimes. It's understandable that Johnny was disappointed when you rescheduled the park outing, but it's important for him to understand that sometimes things don't go as planned.\r  \n\r  \nIt's okay to take care of yourself too. Being a new mom can be exhausting, and it's important to prioritize your own well-being so that you can take care of others. It's also important to communicate with Johnny and let him know that you care about him too and will make it up to him.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, it doesn't seem like you're being the asshole in this situation. It's important to balance your own needs with the needs of others, and sometimes that means making adjustments to plans.", "NTA.\n\nTen years is old enough to understand that schedules sometimes have to be altered.\n\nLike every other relative who appears on this site, he's selfish and tyrannical.

Johnny is 10 years, not 10 months, meaning he's acting out due to jealousy. Never let \"I hate you\" go unanswered; it's the epitome of an attempt at emotional manipulation. Retort with something an emotionally healthy 10 year old would hate to hear: that he's acting like a baby. I also like to make a child use their common sense: the baby is helpless so if he would help that would be more time you could spend with him. You may want to say through his bedroom door that you can talk when he comes out but otherwise leave him in there.\n\nI remember I was only a teen and a cousin's toddler was acting up. I got on my knees, held the kid by both shoulders, looked in her eyes and asked her to tell me how I can make her feel happy. She stopped crying immediately and at 3ish years old said \"mommy won't listen to me\". \n\nThese anti-brat tips will help you with your own baby!

He should be expected to apologize - this is too big a reaction for missing a park date.\n\nOp has nothing to feel bad about. Sometimes people get sick or busy and they can't stick to a plan. As long as it's not a chronic thing it's no big deal. If it is a chronic thing then she's not the best choice of babysitter and the parents should find someone else.", "He's probably close to OP and jealous and worried she'll forget him now that the baby is here.

What a ridiculous comment.", "10 is old enough to learn that circumstances change and the plans made yesterday can't be followed through today for reasons outside anyone's control. \n\nWould he have still been accusing you of lying if you couldn't go because the weather turned nasty unexpectedly? \n\nYou didn't plan on the baby having a rough night or getting no sleep.

But you should learn now that the word maybe is a parent's best friend. \"Maybe we can go . . . if you help with chores/if the baby sleeps better tonight/if the weather is good enough.\" Of course, I had a child who always confused maybe and definitely, so that may not be the best advice.", "NTA. Your nephew seems spoiled and demanding. Don't feed into it. If his parents haven't explained and examples empathy to him at this point they need to start. It would have been nice to go to the park to get you and the baby out of the house but what good would you have been exhausted like that. Too many things require your sharp attention when dealing with kids in a public setting and a lack of sleep would have inhibited your awareness, reflexes, etc.", "Fair, but it\u2019s those people who probably aren\u2019t raising their kids to regulate their emotions either.", "YTA . . . simply because you're making an effort to have the internet call a disappointed 10 year old an A H.\n\nAll you had to do is apologize and take your nephew to a park at a later time.
