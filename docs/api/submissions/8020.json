She needed to go the grocery store so I offered to drive. My niece came with us. \n\nI honestly don't know the whole timeline here because she started yelling right away but MAYBE we are talking 5-7 minutes. I wanted to park as close as I could to the front door because I hate to walk very far to get in a store. For whatever reason the parking lot was packed so it took a little while of driving to find a good spot. A few minutes into it my niece started saying she wasn't feeling well. I told her just a few minutes. My sister started screaming \"oh my god just park, just park\" I told her my reasoning and she said \"I don't give a fuck, just park.\" I told her that was nice language in front of her kid and at that exact moment my niece threw up all over the back seat of my car. My sister asked \"are you happy?\" and I responded with \"yeah you are paying for that to be detailed\" and then we got in this huge screaming match and she eventually she went in the store without even offering to help me clean out most of the mess on the spot. She got her husband to pick her and my niece up and I haven't seen her. \n\nWe have been exchanging angry texts all day long and I think I should hold firm that she needs to have my car fully detailed. \n\nI guess while I'm holding firm, am I the asshole?\n\n\nedit: can people please read the question I'm asking?", "created_utc": 1674430722, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ixwb5/aita_for_insisting_my_sister_pay_for_my_car_to_be/", "score": 299, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't wait for them to puke, them blame it on them. This is not how it works.", "INFO\n\nWhy not just drop them at the door before you spend all that time circling?", "YTA.\n\nSo you spent 5-7 minutes circling a parking lot after a child said she wasn't feeling well and the mother told you to park, because you're too lazy to walk an extra hundred feet to the store?\n\nWhat exactly did you think was going to happen?", "Motion sickness is a thing.  There are so many ways you could have avoided this. Five to seven MINUTES circling for a parking space?! Thank the gods you don\u2019t know me to offer any favors my way.

Were you deliberately winding up your sister and niece?", "YTA and I might be biased cause I can\u2019t stand when people drive all over trying to get that closer spot. If you don\u2019t have a disability then the walk is likely good for you. Plus your sister told you to park, your niece told you she was unwell, and still you wanted to circle to avoid an extra minute of walking?!", "YTA. You did that to yourself. Circling the lot takes longer than just parking and walking.", "Yta your niece was sick but you kept going. Just walk the extra few meters it won\u2019t kill you", "YTA, you had every opportunity not to be, but look at you go. It\u2019s all about you isn\u2019t it? YIKES", "YTA, I used to get severe motion sickness as a child and I still do to this day however I can take preventative measures to stop it/alleviate it.

You sound exhausting, lazy and lacking in common sense.", "YTA. It's really hard to control nausea, the kid warned you, you asked her to... hold it??? I'm almost 30 and I can barely hold it if I'm car sick, and even then it's a 50/50 chance if I don't get out of the car then. You should have dropped the kid and your sister off.", "YTA.

You were cussed at to park, you kept driving. You decide to criticize your sister's language while you kept driving.

This story made my stomach churn.", "YTA. Your niece told you she was getting sick and your sister told you to park. You ignored both of them to find a closer parking spot making it your own fault she puked in your car", "First I had everybody sucks here as my judgement, but then I recognized that you conveniently left out the age of your niece. \n\nI'll go with YTA. \n\nTelling her that she had to pay for the cleaner while her daughter is literally covered in puke is such an asshole move. I can't believe that you feel justified here. \n\nYou obviously care more about a parking spot and money than to just give a damn about the people around you.", "INFO: Why?\n\nAre you disabled in a way that impacts your ability to walk?

I\u2019m disabled, struggle to walk even from handicapped spots sometimes and if my nephew told me he was going to get sick I\u2019d immediately park, no matter how far it is, and get him what he needs.

That you put your comfort over her health.", "YTA - this is so dumb, so so very dumb", "YTA. i might even blacklisted you from any event i host for what you did.", "I would have strangled you long before the kid puked. In a non lethal melodramatic style ofc but WTF\n\nYTA", "YTA it\u2019s your fault your niece threw up", "YTA\n\nToo lazy to walk a few extra feet so you circled around making your niece sick and then ignored your sister when she asked you to just park the damn car and also ignored your niece when she TOLD you she was feeling sick.    \nIt's your fault.

Just the fact that your niece was so sick she threw up and you didn't care even a little bit about the child's distress is enough to make you the asshole.\n\nEverything about your post just screams people of Walmart tbh.", "YTA \nAt the very least you could have offered to drop them off. But you insisted on circling so you didn\u2019t have to walk, you need to deal with the consequences of that. Including paying to get your own car cleaned.", "YTA. you wasted way more time finding a \u201cgood spot\u201d than just walking your ass from whatever spot you got in the back. And to top it off, you got puke in your car. If i were your sister i absolutely would not pay.", "YTA.\n\nYour niece told you that she wasn't feeling well. She got sick because of you.", "Yeah, YTA. Your sister told you her daughter wasn\u2019t feeling well, yet you continued driving looking for a closer spot because you\u2019re lazy. \n\nIt sucks that your car got thrown up in, but to demand a full detail? That\u2019s ridiculous. Puke happens. Unless your niece is Linda Blair, I doubt she threw up all over the car. Clean the area of puke and move on.", "YTA", "YTA.  Your sister didn\u2019t need to scream and curse at you.  But it\u2019s utterly obnoxious to drive around in circles because you don\u2019t feel like walking.

You had many options here. Let them out at the front and meet them inside to start with, park in the first available spot, or at least have stopped when niece said she wasn't well. Your stubbornness at insisting on a close spot in a busy lot made her sick, you likely know she gets carsick already, so while it would be nice of sister to help pay to clean it, it's all on you.", "YTA. Actions have consequences, and the consequences of your actions is vomit in the backseat.  You had the option to stop, and you chose to obsess over a parking space.  So this was the result.", "In 5-7 minutes you could have been parked and been inside, quite frankly you have throw up in your car because you wanted to be lazy by finding close parking", "Yta. You \"despise\" walking and made your niece suffer because of it. As someone who gets car/motion sick, circling a parking lot would be miserable. If you would have just parked, or even let them out, you wouldn't have needed to post this.", "YTA. You should have let her out if you didnt want vomit all over your car.", "YTA\n\n1. You people who obsess over particular parking spots drive everyone else in the lot insane.  Is walking that bad for you? Do you have a disability.?\n\n2. Your niece stated she wasn't feeling well and your solution was to continue to obsess over parking.", "YTA. She told you to park. You refused. You were told she was getting sick. You brought this on yourself. Hope the parking spot was worth it! :)", "Totally YTA. No mention of any concern for your niece or how you probably made her feel even worse by arguing. Kids always blame themselves. You are acting like an entitled child.", "YTA. Take the advice given here and change your attitude. You\u2019re inconveniencing everyone, including yourself, just to avoid the slightest bit of physical activity. Yikes!", "YTA. Pay for your own detailing.", "eh.\n\ngoing with YTA. here. she asked u multiple times to park. she obviously wasn't feeling good. just park man.\n\nregardless of who is the ahole, u don't need to pay to get ur car literally detailed, give me a break. That's like a once every 2 years $150 thing u do.

The reason you should pay is because your actions are what caused her to get sick.\n\nAlso on a side note, You spent 6 minutes looking for parking, had to parked further away and walked a *tiny* bit extra you would have spent less time overall.
