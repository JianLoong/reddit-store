She has a coworker who she's known for about 3 months. They're on good terms but she's never met his wife, I've never met him etc. So they are very much friends at just work.\n\nUnfortunately his father passed away and he had to go back to his home country today. His wife is 5 months pregnant and scared of being alone. My wife knew his dad was sick and told him yesterday that she's happy to help in any way including having her stay at ours for a couple of days. \n\nHis father passed away this morning and he called her asking if his wife can come over tonight to stay for a week. My wife was a bit taken aback because she had honestly not expected it. Anyway, she asked me and I said no. We don't know who this person is, what she's like, she's 5 months pregnant we might have to take her to the doc and to hospital and be responsible if something happens. It was just weird to me and I said I wouldn't be comfortable. My wife said that I'm an uncaring asshole and that we should be helping them. Anyway, she said no to her coworker but said she can go check in on his wife from time to time.\n\nSo am I the asshole for saying no?", "created_utc": 1697244729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177dhy4/aita_for_saying_my_wifes_colleagues_wife_cant/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She said to coworker that she's happy to help in any way including having wife stay for a couple of days. Then when coworker takes her up on the offer, it's surprised pikachu and \"my husband says no\". Pretty messed up.", "NTA. I wouldn't be comfortable with that either. And shame on your wife for offering without consulting you first.", "NTA, but why is your wife offering something she wasn't expecting to have to follow-through on and did not discuss with you first?", "NTA.\n\nYour wife definitely should have clarified boundaries when indicating what sort of help she could offer is the coworker left pregnant wife alone to go to the funeral, etc. And your wife should have checked with you before offering your home as a place to stay for any length of time.\n\nIt's concerning to me that the coworker and his 5 months pregnant wife have zero or very little support system in place. I can understand that they may be relatively new immigrants to your country, I can understand that they may not have met many people yet, etc. But unless they are from a teeny tiny country and/or have moved to a teeny tiny isolated area, there could very well be folks of a similar background if they would be most comfortable in a culturally homogenous setting. Or they could participate in various social gatherings to meet new people, etc. Assuming the wife is staying at home most of the time for a while after baby is born, she will need more support than just husband (whether or not he has parental leave). It is not your responsibility as a couple or your wife's responsibility as a friend to become the de facto support system for everything. I would frame a discussion with your wife around that issue, indicating that you totally understand her desire to help this couple but clearly they need more help than either or both of you can provide.", "NTA.  She's going to be a mother, responsible for another human being and she's afraid of being alone? Time for her to learn how to be brave. You're not a babysitter...or a mommy-sitter.", "NTA. Your wife shouldn't have offered to have this woman stay without clearing it with you first, and her coworker's request is weird, I can't imagine that his wife would feel more comfortable staying with total strangers than staying alone. Either way, she's an adult, she can look after herself for a week.", "NTA. My husband and I are also both in early thirties with an 18 month old and I asked him his opinion on what we\u2019d do. Personally we\u2019d probably take her in. HOWEVER you\u2019re 100% NTA for not be comfortable in taking her in you\u2019re in the right to not let in someone you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s your house and you deserve to be comfortable in your house and that includes not letting someone else intrude on that.", "NTA\n\nyou don't know who this woman is, what she is like.\n\nYou would become responsible for her wellbeing should something happen.\n\nYour Wife is an AH for offering without even consulting you.", "NAH. Coworker asked for help and you refused. There\u2019s also cultural issues at play. I\u2019m assume you\u2019re in US. It\u2019s also entirely possible that the coworker has no other support system outside of work friendships in the city. \n\nThere\u2019s no harm in helping someone you have no deep relationships with but you\u2019re not obligated to help them out", "nta - Your wife's coworkers wife is not your problem. Your personal space and comfort are important. Plus you have a kid. Don't let a stranger live in your home with you. It will be a really bad time and open doors to all kinds of trouble. Your wife should go stay with her if she doesn't want her to be alone that badly.", "NTA. Your wife has barely had the time to get to know this man, she certainly doesn't know his wife, and you're *uncaring* for not wanting a literal stranger to stay with you guys? Your wife was even taken aback by the request, so what's the deal?\n\nWhat, are you supposed to pack her up in the car whenever you go out, or will you leave this stranger in your home alone? That's insane lol\n\nIf your wife wants to go over to check on this woman like she's a pet left alone for the week, good for her, but you're being a reasonable, rational human here, don't worry about it.", "A work colleague she's known for 3 months that she does not see outside of work asks if his pregnant wife can stay with her & OP for a week because the wife is scared of being alone and he has to go on a trip for a funeral?\n\nThis is such a weird frigging scenario I kind of think this is one of the BS posts filling this subreddit lately.\n\n1. Pregnant women can fly in airplanes.  Why doesn't she just go with?\n2. Do they have no real friends or family?\n3. An adult soon-to-be mom can't stay by herself for a week? Wtaf. I'm feeling bad for the imaginary kid.  Maybe he can grow up to be an imaginary author writing Gothic horror centered around crazy mother figures.\n\nIn any event, if real, these people are so effing strange you definitely don't want one of them living with you for a week.\n\nAnd, if real, I'd suggest OP's wife back way the hell off this guy at work.  Does OP's wife always have shitty boundaries?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI hope your wife learned a lesson from this. Don't make offers you aren't able to keep, especially when you are promising something for someone else (you, in the case) to do. Being voluntold is annoying and good for you for not being railroaded.", "NTA- Your wife failed to communicate with you PRIOR to offering your home. Also, I wouldn't take anyone that says YTA for not hosting a stranger seriously.", "Nta your wife can\u2019t just be inviting strangers into your home with your child living there. Ask her if she would be okay if you did this. Pregnant or not you do not know this woman and you should let your child be around a stranger for a whole week", "You:  NTA  \nYour Wife:  TA", "NTA. If your wife cares that much then she can go stay with her", "nta. it's she's so worried, your wife can go to their place for a week.", "NAH. Your wife should have checked with you before making the promises. I\u2019d be incredibly uncomfortable with a stranger staying for a week too.\n\nA 5 month pregnant woman should be super capable of looking after herself, your wife going and checking in is quite enough.\n\nLesson for the future.", "Ummm, any people here who were scared to be home alone overnight when 5 mos pregnant?  \n\nClearly, if the wife has a high risk pregnancy and is on bedrest of some such, she needs to have some sort of caregiver staying with her during her husband's absence.\n\nBut if this is a normal pregnancy, I find this quite strange.  I'm not the bravest person on earth, but it didn't phase me when my husband went on business trips during my pregnancies.  Is this unusual?  \n\nThis situation makes me think that the unknown pregnant woman might have some emotional issues that would further complicate the situation of having a total stranger living in OP's house.  In the same house as their toddler.  So no.  Absolutely not.\n\nNTA", "NTA you don't even know her. How weird and uncomfortable that he even asked.", "Your wife messed up on multiple levels. First was not asking you before she offered your house. Second was telling her coworker his wife could stay for a couple days. Third was blaming you instead of admitting she wrongly made an offer that you were in the dark about. Your wife needs to do a whole lot better in treating you like an equal partner. She\u2019s pissed off 3 people with this. She should just go stay at that woman\u2019s house til the coworker returns. NTA", "Seriously WTF is wrong with spouses who let people stay in their marital home without asking their husband or wife.\nThen they try and call out their spouse for apparently being uncaring. \nWell sweetheart if you asked you'd know the answer, but you think you have a right to invite a stranger into our home with out asking.\n\nI'll tell you what let me go shopping and invite a complete stranger to stay and see how you like it.", "YTA\n\nIts a week - not a lifetime!!\n\n>My wife said that I'm an uncaring asshole and that we should be helping them\n\nAnd shes right.", "YTA.  Yeah, you don't know her but your wife sounds like a caring and decent person who wants to help her colleague out.  It's a week.  She's scared and pregnant.  Surely you can find it within yourself to show compassion to someone in her position.", "What about just being kind to a person in need, and forgetting about all the YTA/NTA business? You could just help someone out, and in a week they'd be gone.", "YTA for god sake\u2019s have a heart. His wife needs to feel secure while he\u2019s gone. What is she gonna do to you?", "You\u2019re not an asshole for saying no but your reasons are bonkers. She\u2019s pregnant not a child herself. Having someone stay as a guest doesn\u2019t make them stop being an adult responsible for themselves. It\u2019s still your space though so you get to decide what you\u2019re comfortable with.
