I can understand that they may be relatively new immigrants to your country, I can understand that they may not have met many people yet, etc. But unless they are from a teeny tiny country and/or have moved to a teeny tiny isolated area, there could very well be folks of a similar background if they would be most comfortable in a culturally homogenous setting. Or they could participate in various social gatherings to meet new people, etc. Assuming the wife is staying at home most of the time for a while after baby is born, she will need more support than just husband (whether or not he has parental leave). It is not your responsibility as a couple or your wife's responsibility as a friend to become the de facto support system for everything.

I lived away from my country. It is incredible, when you live so far from family and everything you know, how te littlest of acts come across as the most helpful. \n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine the horror of being 5 months pregnant in a place where I know none and having the only person I know (husband) leaving on a family emergency. There are so many things that can go wrong. So many things you might need help with. Simple mundane things, like grocery shopping can be difficult when you live abroad, never mind 5 m/o pregnant. \n\nThis person is in an impossible situation. 100% not ideal either to depend on other people\u2019s generosity to go about her regular day. \n\nYou didn\u2019t sign up for that, I understand. It is not your responsibility, I get it. But having been in a situation in which I needed help being away from home, I hope she finds the person who can help her.

Your wife\u2019s offer was taken as genuine and then she retracted it.\n\n\nI have no idea why she offered this help rather than checking on the wife from the beginning. Bringing a pregnant lady who neither of you knows into your home sounds uncomfortable socially and she wouldn\u2019t feel at home either most likely. Also she should have asked you before offering to have a house guest. I don\u2019t know if the wife is medically risky with her pregnancy or if she is just nervous as it\u2019s her first but bringing someone you don\u2019t know into your home with a promise of looking after them while their husband is abroad dealing with a funeral means your wife would be responsible for getting her to medical help if she needed it and if the situation got bad, since both of you are basically strangers to her, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to support her at the hospital- a family member or friend who knows her would be more support.\n\n\nI think you need to talk to your wife about her offering help to people which she isn\u2019t able or willing to actually give. Set down what things need both of you on board before help is offered, like no long stay guests (more than a couple of nights) without us both agreeing. And she owes her colleague an apology for offering then retracting help in his hour of need. She should definitely go check on the wife and bring some meals or groceries or something since she\u2019s committed to doing that.

And do some self-reflecting.", "so, this coworker's wife is scared of being alone in their home for a week but she isn't scared of going to a house she's never been to, to stay with people she never met? \n\nNTA - I can totally understand not wanting to have complete strangers in your home. also, if that woman is about to be a parent, she might as well start learning how to take care of herself first, because soon she will have to take care of a timy new human which is way more scary than staying alone for a few days...", "NTA. You don\u2019t know enough about these folks to be comfortable and I don\u2019t blame you.", "NTA as your wife should not have offered for her colleague\u2019s wife to stay without clearing it with you. Wife\u2019s a major asshole to make an offer and then being pikachu face that they wanted to take her up on it.", "NTA just because your wife should have asked you before extending an invitation for anybody to stay at your home.", "NTA. Your wife should not have offered before speaking with you, and she should not be making offers that she doesn\u2019t intend to make good on.", ">Your wife definitely should have clarified boundaries when indicating what sort of help she could offer\n\nShe did. She clarified and offered exactly this. OP is NTA but the wife *did* clarify and then was shocked when she was asked to do *exactly what she offered.*", "Probably wanting to show herself as always helpful, not expecting that she could have to do something when somebody takes her up on that.", "Do you really have a life outside Reddit?\n\nAll your questions have very possible answers:\n\n1. Yes and not, after certain week airlines refuse to board pregnant women due to risk of starting labor. This may not be the case here as she is only 5months but it can also be contraindicated by the doctors if the pregnancy is consider risk and if flight is to long\n\n2. Maybe they are new in town..... is quite hard to build a support group when you arrive to a new city and dont know anybody and work full time.\n\n3. She most probably has a risk pregnancy and is the reason why she couldnt travel, staying alone can be dangerous in case something happens that she need to go to hospital but is alone.\n\nOf course none of that is OP business and if he doesn't feel confortable having an stranger at home , that is ok, but it doesn't mean that the wife or the co-worker are AH.\n\nBy the way, outside of USA is quite common for people to help strangers. There is even a platform in EU where people offer their sofa or guest room to travelers that are on low budget, for freee.", "That was my thought as well. This is a weird request from the coworker. What grown woman is afraid to stay in her own home by herself?", "This isn\u2019t a time of need for the wife. She\u2019s a grown woman. She doesn\u2019t want to stay home alone, but she certainly can. Definitely NTA", "Wife should go to their house and be with the wife if she cares so much", "She said a 'couple of days' not 'a week'. There's a big difference. Either way she should have checked with OP before offering anything.", "And in the U.S., putting a woman with a medically complicated pregnancy in the care of strangers is weird.  Putting any pregnant woman in the care of strangers is weird. No one would take on that liability here.  Putting up healthy travelers visiting your country, maybe; but probably for cash, and there would be some sort of umbrella organization you'd be connecting through for liability purposes.\n\nPossibly, the co-worker does not understand U.S. culture yet.  But OP's wife does, so..  she's the A-h.\n\nAlso, where'd they move from? Siberia?  If they're new immigrants to the U.S., there are organizations they'd have been alerted to during the immigration process.  If they are from out of town, they have people they know in the U.S.  Send the wife there.  \n\nDo they have a local church?  This would be a less odd request of your congregation.\n\nBut, outside of church or local immigrant community organizations, this is a highly unusual ask for someone who isn't a trusted friend or a family member.", "I can understand installing better window security and door locks. \n\nSelf-defense course and a handgun training course with regular time at the range are options, too.  If everyone is comfortable with those ideas.\n\n But we don't need babysitters.", "Yes.  Not only sending pregnant wife off to be with strangers, but one is (and I am making an assumption here) an unknown man.  This doesn't sound real at all.", "That\u2019s fascinating- I have noticed people using those words very differently. I always heard when I grew up couple = 2, several = 2, few = 3 generally but maybe 4 or 5.", "OP\u2019s wife is not even a well meaning one. She offered to let her coworker\u2019s wife stay with them and was shocked when the time came they took her up on the offer. The wife had no intention of actually helping them and is using OP to be the bad guy", ">. There's a big difference.\n\nNo. There is not.\n\nYes she should have checked with OP not disagreeing with that.", "Not necessarily, depending on their situation and schedules her being gone for a night or whatever could mean either they need some sort of child care of their own, or OP needs to take time off work.", "That's a great point I didn't pick up on!"]}
