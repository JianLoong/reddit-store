[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gqspa/aita_for_asking_my_sister_wtf_she_expected_to/)\n\nIf you were hoping for more fuckery you will be sorely disappointed. My father and husband had a talk with several of the miscreants that would be attending the wedding and put the fear of, if not God, then at least them into the children. \n\nWe found someone to sing The Rose and my husband stepped in as a groomsman. As I commented I did apologize to my sister for my insensitive snort and comment and I was her matron of honor. We also got a couple of girls to fill in for the missing bridesmaids. \n\nThe wedding went off beautifully and when everything was said and done the only real consequences are one divorce that was probably going to happen anyway, one arrest that will be plead to a misdemeanor most likely, and one pair of underwear, one sock and a pair of jeans. \n\nSorry to disappoint but nothing much of note happened at the wedding or reception.", "created_utc": 1691682007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15nfv7d/update_the_story_of_my_sisters_shit_show/", "score": 257, "replies": ["RIP to the sock, undies and jeans.

Happy it all worked out.", "Oh yes, we recall :)", "Thanks so much for the update! I wish more posts had them", "In the very least, sounds like the MOH got thrown out of the sister's life, given that OP was matron of honour instead.", "Hey glad to hear it worked out for the happy couple. Your OP and your [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gqspa/aita_for_asking_my_sister_wtf_she_expected_to/jumii3f) had me laughing pretty good.\n\nYou tapdanced around it hilariously, but I gotta ask: how did your dad do with giving away his daughter to the man that shit himself in the limo? Bet he took it like a champ. Also, did player #3 from La Tour Eiffel remain a groomsman?", "Darn. I was hoping for more fuckery", "Thxs Op, I really needed the laugh.", "I think your sister got lucky you only snorted I'd have been crying with laughter, which to be fair probably wouldn't have helped either.\n\nI'm amazed at the number of people mad at you in the original post. You did not need to hire a psychic to see the party was going to end in tears, have these people never met any fellow humans?\n\nI'm glad your sister's wedding went well and I hope she's learned a valuable lesson. On the off chance she hasn't could you let us know how their first wedding anniversary goes?", "> The only consequences are one divorce\n\nCool cool cool, no big.", "Thanks for the laugh.", "It can be that story they tell their teens later on scare them straight."]}
