However, it's time to stop doing all of the emotional labor in this relationship. You shouldn't be assigning him jobs.

In my (and many other girlfriend's) experience, it almost seems to take a FLIPPING THE F- OUT to wake some of these men up to how at the end of our rope we are.

Ex: dropping hints about being interested in them), I think some of them really are so dang oblivious to the emotional toll this stuff takes.

And I hope you realize that you deserve better. A partner who has your back, not another child to take care of.", "Why are you still \"gently\" reminding him? He's a grown man, he doesn't need reminders like a child. He is using weaponized incompetence to get away with less. NTA", "NTA. Hope you're feeling better soon.

There is a lot of pent up frustration in your post and we all need to vent sometimes but you need to sit down and think long and hard about a couple of things:  \n\n\n1. Is it possible that you hold your SO to very specific standards and the 'instructions' you give come off as a bit...rigid? As in, can the things you ask him to do be done in more than one way?\n2. Are some of the things you ask of them that important/urgent? Can you delegate?\n3. Do you maybe gaslight and diminish his contributions too? Yes, being a SHM is hard and stressful but so is being the main breadwinner. You say 'they're hardly doing anything at work' - how can you be so sure?  \n\n\nHave you tried sitting down and explaining how you feel? Maybe some couples counseling would do you good before resentment kicks in and buries what little respect and love you have for your partner (if any at all). Good luck!", "Going with NAH. Sounds like you both need a discussion about shared responsibilities and trading off with the kids sometime to give you a break.\n\nAlso, maybe you two plan a weekend or something for a date together and arrange for the kids to be taken care for a bit.

If wash my hair and don't use conditioner, it will tangle and clump immediately and ive had to have tangles cut out.
