I\u2019ll then get up and find out that my roommate has been switching the ac off while I\u2019m sleeping. This really upsets me because it\u2019s been making me really dehydrated and tired to begin with from not sleeping well and it\u2019s been impacting my work.\n\nShe\u2019s unemployed right now so I thought she might\u2019ve been hung up about the power bill. When I finally talked to her about it I explained that I\u2019m already very sensitive to heat to begin with and that because we\u2019re fortunate enough to have ac I want to enjoy it when I get home especially after a long day at work, and that the heat is causing problems for me. I even offered to foot some of her share of the power bill if she was really that concerned about it. But then she said that she turns it off because the apartment gets too cold (I should add that our AC is set at 70 and has never been moved lower than that). \n\nI told her that she should just use some blankets or put a sweater on if it was really bothering her, because the heat is unbearable. She then countered by saying that because she\u2019s in recovery from anorexia she\u2019s really sensitive to cold and that I\u2019m not prioritizing her needs. I then responded by saying, \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to your situation, but that is your problem and not mine, and it is starting to have a negative impact on me and we need to find some middle ground here, because I can\u2019t take off my skin when it gets too hot.\u201d She then got extremely upset and angry and told me that I was being ableist and insensitive.

Your heat sensitivity is your problem, not hers. Once you made that argument, you lost all footing in an otherwise straightforward case. Yes, she can use blankets while you can not take off skin. But that's your problem, not hers.", "NTA \n\nAs you said, you can't get more than naked. She can put on more clothes and blankets and close vents in her bedroom. And 70 isn't unreasonable. Maybe bump it up to 72, but turning it off completely is ridiculous.", "Can she get an electric blanket or something if layering isn\u2019t working?", "I can see both points of view but I live in the same sort of situation and as you say, it's easier to wear layers for warmth than it is to make yours cooler. 70 seems warm to me but maybe see if she would be willing to leave it on at 72. I didn't see anything ableist in what you said so it makes me think she is trying to guilt you into catering to her.", "NTA but 70 is a really low AC temp. Could you compromise on the temp, add a fan in your room, and block the vents to her room?", "ESH. There are more solutions than keep it at 70 or turn it off. They make magnets to block vents so the AC isn't blowing directly on her. You can increase the temperature - some people are saying 70 is perfectly reasonable, whereas I would be cold (and I definitely don't have an eating disorder). There's no magic \"right\" number. \n\nI don't know why I see this argument with ac more than heating, but so many people seem to forget temperature is a gradient and you can probably find one where neither of you is miserable.", "Info\n\nIs there an air vent in her bedroom where she sleeps at night and is feeling too cold? \n\nCan she close the vent or block it with something as a compromise? Like tape it shut if it's on the wall or put a heavy book on top of it if it's on the floor?", "I mean you being sensitive to heat is also your problem but yeah, she can buy a space heater.", "You each have a  problem. Neither of you should feel uncomfortable in your own home. You\u2019re correct in suggesting you both work together to find a mutually agreeable solution. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She can\u2019t expect you to cater to her own wants and completely ignore yours. Suggest to her that she closes her vent in her bedroom and see how that goes.", "Why would you prioritize her? She\u2019s not your parent or your child. NTA", "So her inability to keep warm isn't your problem but your inability to stay cool is hers...?", "70f is pretty reasonable, but coming from someone who gets hot at night, that can still be a bit cold, could you compromise at 75?", "Just want to clarify something, as I\u2019m English and have very limited experience with ACs. Can\u2019t you set different rooms to different temperatures or have it off in one room and on in another? \n\nIf not can\u2019t you look into getting a system that does to solve the issue? \n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are in the wrong necessarily. You BOTH have valid reasons for wanting to be comfortable. However, you are being insensitive by saying, \u2018yeah I know you have an issue but it\u2019s affecting me negatively so you should cater to me\u2019. Can\u2019t she say the same to you?", "Nta 72 is where my thermostat lives in the winter. Bring her home a cheeseburger and fries get her some meat on her bones.", "NTA, and please do not listen to people saying 70 is an unreasonable AC temp. I keep my own house at 72 while I'm there, but that's 100% out of cost considerations and not comfort. I have a separate window AC that cools my bedroom down to 63 for sleep. This may be a good compromise solution as well.", "NTA. Ask her how she'd like it if you turned the heat off in the winter.", "ESH.   \n\n\nYou did the right thing by offering to find a middle ground.\n\n  \nI suggest putting the A/C on 73 and getting a floor fan for your bedroom.   \n\n\nIf your roommate is cold, she is capable of dressing more warmly. \n\nI am a skinny broad who wears a sweater in my house during the summer. I also bring a sweater with me when I go out to run errands.", "NTA. You were understanding of her situation and tried to find a middle ground. It would be different if you just went nuclear on her but you didn\u2019t and well don\u2019t for that, you handled it well I would say!", "NTA.\n\nYou should not have to compromise your health to accommodate her.\n\nI would start looking for alternative accommodation. She won't compromise and you probably need to relocate to somewhere you can be comfortable.", "NTA. You were right when you said that she can add layers, but you can\u2019t take off your skin. She can even get a heated blanket. This isn\u2019t your problem. I\u2019d be pissed too.", "NTA.. Men have to deal with the same thing in the work environment in relation to women because we have a defacto dress code, they do not. In both cases the question is thus.  Who is it easier for to correct their situation?  Is it easier to put on additional layers, or to strip them off?  Well.. we know at work if I stripped off my business attire down to my boxer briefs and T, that would not fly, so the girls who go au natural except a sun dress probably ought to bring their panties and a sweater.  Since you aren't likely to be stripping your skin off any time soon, it stands to reason that the AC stays on.. perhaps at 72-74 to be accommodating, and your roommate gets a blanket.\n\n\n\n\nYour heat exhaustion is directly impacted by the situation, I am not even sure how this other person is trying to relate an eating disorder to temp, except that their refusal to consume calories is running their BP and energy level low, which again  is far easier to fix by eating appropriately than overheating by wishes and prayers for her eating disorder..", "NAH. Being cold is a much easier fix than being hot. Waking up shivering sucks but waking up sweaty is downright awful.", "NTA\n\n21 c ( 70 f ) is way to hot for me, she should really get a winter jacket or something.", "ESH bc your sensitivity to heat also isn't her problem \n\nAnd her sensitivity to cold isn't your problem. Come up with a compromise", "NTA\n\nI agree with you that she can wear a sweater or use a blanket while you can't take your skin off. \n\nI think 70F is a pretty reasonable temperature for night time.", "NTA but find a new roommate. The two of you are not compatible. \n\nI am not anorexic but I couldn't live with you either. I set the temp at 70 in winter when I am wearing long pants and 2 sweaters. In summer when I am wearing shorts and I light cotton top I would freeze at 70. As a short term solution I could add layers of clothing but would not want to have to change my clothes every time I go out the door. I want to enjoy the summer heat (not 90 but maybe 80).", "NTA.  I think you handled it really well and offered a compromise.  You weren't ableist at all.  Nor did you disrespect her eating disorder.", "NTA.\n\nShe can use a blanket. There's nothing you can do to get cooler.", "NTA but i dont see a solution with both happy.", "NTA. She can get a space heater or put on more clothes. Or since you seem willing to compromise, she can turn the thermostat to a warmer temp but not turn it off entirely.", "NTA, and she can put on more clothes. I will say that there should be some compromise here that you did not offer. If I lived with you and you wanted the AC set as low as 70, I\u2019d ask to turn it up higher. AC this low is super uncomfortable to me, and gives me headaches. When I worked full time in office buildings, even with layers, a space heater, and breaks outside, by the time I left at the end of the day during warm months, my head hurt badly, and I physically felt like crap. It is near impossible for me to be comfortable for more than a few minutes in 70 degree air conditioning, even with extra clothing. I don\u2019t know what it is, but having cold air blasting through a space (vs just being a pleasant 70 degrees outside), is brutal. I don\u2019t have an eating disorder and am far from the only person who has this issue with AC. 73 is likely still a comfortable indoor temp, especially if you use lighter bed sheets. This is where my boyfriend and I compromise to when I\u2019m at his house, and when he is at mine (otherwise I\u2019m at about 75-77). He\u2019ll switch to shorts and a lighter shirt, and I put on long pants and a sweatshirt. Turning the AC off and leaving you in a bad spot is not okay, but asking her to be the one making the full compromise by bundling up, is also not okay. The AC needs to be set higher than 70.", "NTA: Like you said. She can always put on more blankets. You can hardly take more cloth of.", "NTA. \n\nHeat and cold are two different beasts for finding solutions for. \n\nYou can wear warmer clothing much easier than you can shed your skin to get cooler. \n\nShe can also block her vents. No need to shut the air off entirely. Plus, it directly effects the quality of your sleep.", "I mean on one hand 70 is a pretty significant ac temperature, but also yeah its not fair she turns it off. Yes she can use a blanket if it's too cold but also you could shift on the temp some. Or you can keep maybe 70 at sleeping hours when blankets are more easily used and switch to 73 or something during the day.\n\nI'm gonna say EAH because you both need to find middle grounds.", "\u201cableist\u201d whoever came up with that term should be sent to Siberia", "NTA\n\nAs I say always it is always easier to warm up then it is to cool down.", "NTA, look out for yourself. Who's gonna look out for you if you have to be looking out for the needy roommate.", "NTA.  That word... does not mean what she thinks it means.  If she asked you not to talk about dieting or weight issues, then fine, you should support her in that.  If you wanted the thermostat to be at 60 and she was so cold she hurt then you should accommodate that.  But 70 is in a very reasonable range.  And removing from an eating disorder does not prevent you from putting on a sweater.  \n\nIs there any way to block the AC from getting into her space?  Can you block the vent in her room or close a door?  There are magnet things you can buy to close off vents that don't have a closing lever.", "of course you are NTA. she is. Her problem is easily fixed, as you correctly pointed out, by wearing a sweater. yours cannot be, and 70 degrees is a reasonable temperature. I'm sorry you live with such a twit.", "NTA. \n\nIts 90 degrees.  She can put on a damn sweater", "Being too cold is a lot easier to deal with than the heat. Why don't she just wear more layers or blankets. I have a condition where my body can't regulate temperature, so I am very sympathetic when it comes to being too hot. NTA", "Unlike the other posts about temperature, I feel you were being really reasonable. She's very cold and you are very hot, it happens \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f the difference is that you were seeking any sort of compromise and she was refusing to even collaborate. \nI hate the idea that its easy to get hot and hard to cool down, if she is anorexic its not as simple as throwing on more clothes. The whole point of layers is to TRAP the body heat a person already produces. Someone with anorexia has poorer circulation and lower body fat which inberently affects the amount of heat she can produce. So I definitely think that shouldn't be ignored right off the bat as someone who runs cold. \n\nBut you weren't trying to ignore it, and you have needs to. If it's only on when you get home then she has all day to be warm is she wants, you don't get that option. A fair compromise miguht be to buy her a heating blanket that she can bring around the house while the A.C. is on, so you can have your cold and she can still be warm. She could also close the door to her room at night and cover the vents/holes in the door to trap the heat in. There are also sweatshirts and hoodies and vests they sell that are portable and have heating packs, i bought one for ny father once. Or get recgargeable heat packs and sew them ingo a sweater if you're on a budget. Either way, there are options between A.C. and No A.C. \n\nThere is no reason you shouldn't be able to use your own A.C. there are a CRAP ton of applicable solutions.", "I'll go with NTA, as your request is reasonable, but how you chose to communicate does not help either.\nIf you say- being cold is your problem, not mine you put yourself for the counter argument- your sensitivity to heat is your problem, not mine. \nShe can put more layers, but honestly, after what you said, I would not if I was her. Why does she need to make any effort towards you when your argument was ' your problems are not my business?'", "NTA. She needs to cover up. This is obvious. No matter how many clothes you take off, you'll still be hot. She can put on layers.", "NTA I would cover the vent in her room and maybe buy her a robe so she can be covered but comfy", "I\u2019ll say NTA. I grew up in -0 temps. Later I moved to where temps reach over 100 degrees. It\u2019s much easier to bundle up to stay warm than it is to remove layers and cool down. There\u2019s only so much removing you can do.", "Nta. She's being self centered.", "NTA. You were sensitive to her situation but you were also realistic. You can't physically do anything to make yourself cooler but she can take action to make herself warmer. \n\nI think you were being reasonable.", "nta--- she could literally put a jumper on, trying to be awkward for the sake of it", "NTA - I would say between 70 and 75 is normal and reasonable. A few things that might change my mind is like if you insist on hearing to 78 in the winter then I might think it\u2019s unreasonable to cool to 70 in the summer and you should kick in more for utilities. I would say maybe consider changing to 72.", "NTA - 70 isn't even cold. You can always put more layers on/get heaters but you were right in saying that you cant take off your skin once its too hot.", "70 is pretty cold to have AC set. Perhaps you could maintain your apartment at 75, and keep both of you happy?\n\nThe cure for your \"coming home sweaty and exhausted\" is a shower - not to dry yourself with harsh air conditioning.\n\n(And yeah, if she want to be significantly warmer than you do, she should wear a sweater, or cuddle under a blanket.

The malnutrition affects their temperature regulation, and if they are at a lower weight there is not as much insulation. Eating disorders aren't as \"easy to fix\" as you are indicating, though, nor is it simply a \"refusal to consume calories\". It can take years to recover and get to a \"normal\" place, and that's if you're actively working on it. \n\nThat said, heat intolerance is a very real problem as well. OP having the AC at 70 might already be the compromise temperature. It seems cold for people who are able to regulate their temperature or for people who run cold, but there are people who just can't tolerate 72-75. \n\nOP, NTA.", "I had to check, but that would be too hot.", "As OP said you can't take your skin off when you're too hot, you can add another layer when you're too cold. Also OP is suggesting a middle ground NTA", "She doesn\u2019t have a sensitivity to heat needing ac in 90 weather when its probably humid af is normal not sensitive wtf \ud83e\udd23", "73 is nowhere near a comfortable sleep temp. People are often shocked by this, but if you're sleeping above 70, you're impacting the quality of your sleep.", "Yes. This. Take a cool shower when home from the gym, sleep and the. Use AC at night. Saves on electricity too.", "OP: \"we need to find some middle ground here\"", "70 is perfect blanket weather", "Depends.  Thermostats are all different.", "How is hta just because his body likes it at 70 whereas yours likes it at 75. I must be a huge a hole since I keep mine at 67 :)", "So what do you suggest she should do? Remove her skin?", "I keep my house at 18\u00b0C (just shy of 65 on the Fahrenheit scale) as that's what I find comfortable. See how that works? It is easier for a colder person to get warm, then the other way around. At 75 (24\u00b0C)... I'd never set foot in your house - if I did, I wouldn't stick around very long... Method to your madness, perhaps? Haha.", "70 is room temperature in many countries.", "Lol. No.", "What is comfortable for you is irrelevant. The roommate can add layers (even heated blankets exist). But OP can\u2019t remove her skin. That\u2019s all there is to it.", "But the OP nailed it, being cold means you can put layers on, being hot you can't!! I say this as someone with a circulation problem which means I can be extremely cold, so I put more on!!\n\nAlso had anorixic parent who would put layers on when cold instead of people suffering.", "This is exactly my thoughts.\n\nOP did say to their flatmate that they need to compromise. But telling them their anorexia isn\u2019t their problem doesn\u2019t seem a very nice way to put it, considering it\u2019s probably a sensitive issue. I have a feeling the flatmate perhaps didn\u2019t realise OP is trying to compromise because of this.", "OP can\u2019t take off any more layers of clothes when she\u2019s naked. It\u2019s on the roommate to put some blankets on.", "> We need to find some middle ground here\n\nOP literally told her that she\u2019s ready to compromise. The roommate just wants things her way.", "No, heat above 70 at night is completely unreasonable. If she's actually cold at night, she can get thicket blankets or pajamas.", "Waves hands in the air\n\nI use an electric blanket all year round. It's currently 77 outside and 72 inside and the max level is 20, I have it at 18 right now. \n\nNTA OP, NTA it's hot out for normal people and us freeze babies can put layers on. Or in my case an electric blanket.", "That escalated quickly\u2026", "Do you live in a sieve?", "At 50 I would be wearing a parka and toque around the house. Plus thermal longjohns.", "Not necessarily all under one thermostat. You can have what's called zone dampers inside of your air ducts so it stops airflow to one section of the homestead, this using more than one thermostat. You'd also have a zone panel to control airflow to each zone and when one thermostat calls the zone panel would get the single from it. It's almost like closing off a vent to a room to stop airflow. However, you can't have one section (or zone) have heat and one have AC at the same time. Wouldn't work; hot air would be trying to flow while the furnace is on, AC would be calling and trying to make cold air flow, you get the idea. If they have a ductless invertor system with more than one head unit however, those can make AC in one room, heat in the other.", "Fortunately though.. this one has a directly relatable example that does have to do with the male/female relations issues.", "Thanks for the information, when I mentioned BP I surmised something to this effect but was too lazy to look it up to confirm.  I would submit that it is easier for someone with an eating disorder to get comfortable in a cold room than it is with someone who is prone to overheating in a hot room.  One person can do more to change their situation than the other.\n\n\n\n\nI think that I can speak from a position of knowledge on overheating considering that I have been placed on medication that makes me prone to it.  Literally, if I  am not perfectly hydrated and I get hot, my body will pull blood to the surface and evaporate the water out so that I can sweat while robbing my organs of blood.  (if you wanted to know.. feels fucking great... )  I typically run my house at about 73-74, but allow it to get up to 80 sometimes  even with my issues.  72-75 is a reasonable ask for the person who's got regulatory issues toward the cold end of the spectrum.", "Which is why I said ESH. There are ways to cool off also without it being super cold.", "He has a sensitivity to heat. She has a sensitivity to cold, and also, being cold is uncomfortable too. He can always put a fan in his room if he is that hot when he sleeps.", "Not \u201clol. No\u201d. \n\nThis is an ESH situation. 70 degrees is too low. Turning the AC off is also unreasonable. The correct compromise is a higher AC temp, like 73-74, one person wears more clothes and uses heavier bedding, and the other wears fewer clothes and switches to very light bedding. If OP needs the temp lower in her room, than she needs a window/portable unit. She cannot make the whole place a temp that is too low for her roommate (and would be too low for a lot of us; even without eating disorders). It\u2019s totally unfair that only the cold, uncomfortable party has to make changes/accommodations.", "Haha yeah, I\u2019m not replying to comments bc I want to genuinely consider everyone\u2019s takes but I think there is an assumption being made that I\u2019m not willing to compromise - I am! I literally offered it to her. She doesn\u2019t want the ac on at all to begin with."]}
