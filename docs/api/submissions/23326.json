The apartment will stay cool enough for me to fall asleep but then later on I\u2019ll wake up in the middle of the night completely drenched in sweat. I\u2019ll then get up and find out that my roommate has been switching the ac off while I\u2019m sleeping. This really upsets me because it\u2019s been making me really dehydrated and tired to begin with from not sleeping well and it\u2019s been impacting my work.\n\nShe\u2019s unemployed right now so I thought she might\u2019ve been hung up about the power bill. When I finally talked to her about it I explained that I\u2019m already very sensitive to heat to begin with and that because we\u2019re fortunate enough to have ac I want to enjoy it when I get home especially after a long day at work, and that the heat is causing problems for me. I even offered to foot some of her share of the power bill if she was really that concerned about it. But then she said that she turns it off because the apartment gets too cold (I should add that our AC is set at 70 and has never been moved lower than that). \n\nI told her that she should just use some blankets or put a sweater on if it was really bothering her, because the heat is unbearable. She then countered by saying that because she\u2019s in recovery from anorexia she\u2019s really sensitive to cold and that I\u2019m not prioritizing her needs. I then responded by saying, \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to your situation, but that is your problem and not mine, and it is starting to have a negative impact on me and we need to find some middle ground here, because I can\u2019t take off my skin when it gets too hot.\u201d She then got extremely upset and angry and told me that I was being ableist and insensitive. I\u2019m kind of bothered by this because I\u2019ve also had struggles with eating disorders in the past. So am I the asshole here?\n\n(Additional info from a comment I made so it doesn\u2019t get buried: I see a lot of people making the assumption that I\u2019m completely unwilling to compromise with her or that I\u2019m set on having it at 70. During our talk I offered to adjust the temperature but she wants it COMPLETELY off. Not adjusted. Off all the way.

Your heat sensitivity is your problem, not hers. Once you made that argument, you lost all footing in an otherwise straightforward case. Yes, she can use blankets while you can not take off skin. But that's your problem, not hers.", "NTA \n\nAs you said, you can't get more than naked. She can put on more clothes and blankets and close vents in her bedroom. And 70 isn't unreasonable. Maybe bump it up to 72, but turning it off completely is ridiculous.", "Can she get an electric blanket or something if layering isn\u2019t working?", "I can see both points of view but I live in the same sort of situation and as you say, it's easier to wear layers for warmth than it is to make yours cooler. 70 seems warm to me but maybe see if she would be willing to leave it on at 72. I didn't see anything ableist in what you said so it makes me think she is trying to guilt you into catering to her.", "NTA but 70 is a really low AC temp. Could you compromise on the temp, add a fan in your room, and block the vents to her room?", "ESH. There are more solutions than keep it at 70 or turn it off. They make magnets to block vents so the AC isn't blowing directly on her. You can increase the temperature - some people are saying 70 is perfectly reasonable, whereas I would be cold (and I definitely don't have an eating disorder). There's no magic \"right\" number. \n\nI don't know why I see this argument with ac more than heating, but so many people seem to forget temperature is a gradient and you can probably find one where neither of you is miserable.", "Info\n\nIs there an air vent in her bedroom where she sleeps at night and is feeling too cold? \n\nCan she close the vent or block it with something as a compromise? Like tape it shut if it's on the wall or put a heavy book on top of it if it's on the floor?", "I mean you being sensitive to heat is also your problem but yeah, she can buy a space heater.", "You each have a  problem. Neither of you should feel uncomfortable in your own home. You\u2019re correct in suggesting you both work together to find a mutually agreeable solution. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She can\u2019t expect you to cater to her own wants and completely ignore yours. Suggest to her that she closes her vent in her bedroom and see how that goes.", "Why would you prioritize her? She\u2019s not your parent or your child. NTA", "So her inability to keep warm isn't your problem but your inability to stay cool is hers...?", "70f is pretty reasonable, but coming from someone who gets hot at night, that can still be a bit cold, could you compromise at 75?", "Just want to clarify something, as I\u2019m English and have very limited experience with ACs. Can\u2019t you set different rooms to different temperatures or have it off in one room and on in another? \n\nIf not can\u2019t you look into getting a system that does to solve the issue? \n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are in the wrong necessarily. You BOTH have valid reasons for wanting to be comfortable. However, you are being insensitive by saying, \u2018yeah I know you have an issue but it\u2019s affecting me negatively so you should cater to me\u2019. Can\u2019t she say the same to you?", "Nta 72 is where my thermostat lives in the winter. Bring her home a cheeseburger and fries get her some meat on her bones.", "NTA, and please do not listen to people saying 70 is an unreasonable AC temp. I keep my own house at 72 while I'm there, but that's 100% out of cost considerations and not comfort. I have a separate window AC that cools my bedroom down to 63 for sleep. This may be a good compromise solution as well.", "NTA. Ask her how she'd like it if you turned the heat off in the winter.", "ESH.   \n\n\nYou did the right thing by offering to find a middle ground.\n\n  \nI suggest putting the A/C on 73 and getting a floor fan for your bedroom.   \n\n\nIf your roommate is cold, she is capable of dressing more warmly. \n\nI am a skinny broad who wears a sweater in my house during the summer. I also bring a sweater with me when I go out to run errands.", "NTA. You were understanding of her situation and tried to find a middle ground. It would be different if you just went nuclear on her but you didn\u2019t and well don\u2019t for that, you handled it well I would say!", "NTA.\n\nYou should not have to compromise your health to accommodate her.\n\nI would start looking for alternative accommodation. She won't compromise and you probably need to relocate to somewhere you can be comfortable.", "NTA. You were right when you said that she can add layers, but you can\u2019t take off your skin. She can even get a heated blanket. This isn\u2019t your problem. I\u2019d be pissed too.", "NTA.. Men have to deal with the same thing in the work environment in relation to women because we have a defacto dress code, they do not. In both cases the question is thus.  Who is it easier for to correct their situation?  Is it easier to put on additional layers, or to strip them off?  Well.. we know at work if I stripped off my business attire down to my boxer briefs and T, that would not fly, so the girls who go au natural except a sun dress probably ought to bring their panties and a sweater.  Since you aren't likely to be stripping your skin off any time soon, it stands to reason that the AC stays on.. perhaps at 72-74 to be accommodating, and your roommate gets a blanket.\n\n\n\n\nYour heat exhaustion is directly impacted by the situation, I am not even sure how this other person is trying to relate an eating disorder to temp, except that their refusal to consume calories is running their BP and energy level low, which again  is far easier to fix by eating appropriately than overheating by wishes and prayers for her eating disorder..", "NAH. Being cold is a much easier fix than being hot. Waking up shivering sucks but waking up sweaty is downright awful.", "NTA\n\n21 c ( 70 f ) is way to hot for me, she should really get a winter jacket or something.", "ESH bc your sensitivity to heat also isn't her problem \n\nAnd her sensitivity to cold isn't your problem. Come up with a compromise", "NTA\n\nI agree with you that she can wear a sweater or use a blanket while you can't take your skin off. \n\nI think 70F is a pretty reasonable temperature for night time.", "NTA but find a new roommate. The two of you are not compatible. \n\nI am not anorexic but I couldn't live with you either. I set the temp at 70 in winter when I am wearing long pants and 2 sweaters. In summer when I am wearing shorts and I light cotton top I would freeze at 70. As a short term solution I could add layers of clothing but would not want to have to change my clothes every time I go out the door. I want to enjoy the summer heat (not 90 but maybe 80).", "NTA.  I think you handled it really well and offered a compromise.  You weren't ableist at all.  Nor did you disrespect her eating disorder.", "NTA.\n\nShe can use a blanket. There's nothing you can do to get cooler.", "NTA but i dont see a solution with both happy.", "NTA. She can get a space heater or put on more clothes. Or since you seem willing to compromise, she can turn the thermostat to a warmer temp but not turn it off entirely.", "NTA (but leaning towards ESH), and she can put on more clothes. I will say that there should be some compromise here that you did not offer. If I lived with you and you wanted the AC set as low as 70, I\u2019d ask to turn it up higher. AC this low is super uncomfortable to me, and gives me headaches. When I worked full time in office buildings, even with layers, a space heater, and breaks outside, by the time I left at the end of the day during warm months, my head hurt badly, and I physically felt like crap. It is near impossible for me to be comfortable for more than a few minutes in 70 degree air conditioning, even with extra clothing. I don\u2019t know what it is, but having cold air blasting through a space (vs just being a pleasant 70 degrees outside), is brutal. I don\u2019t have an eating disorder and am far from the only person who has this issue with AC. 73 is likely still a comfortable indoor temp, especially if you use lighter bed sheets. This is where my boyfriend and I compromise to when I\u2019m at his house, and when he is at mine (otherwise I\u2019m at about 75-77). He\u2019ll switch to shorts and a lighter shirt, and I put on long pants and a sweatshirt. Turning the AC off and leaving you in a bad spot is not okay, but asking her to be the one making the full compromise by bundling up, is also not okay. The AC needs to be set higher than 70. If 73 is too high for you to sleep in, then you need to get a window/portable AC unit for your room. It\u2019s not okay to make the whole place uncomfortable for your roommate, in order to meet your sleeping needs.", "NTA: Like you said. She can always put on more blankets. You can hardly take more cloth of.", "NTA. \n\nHeat and cold are two different beasts for finding solutions for. \n\nYou can wear warmer clothing much easier than you can shed your skin to get cooler. \n\nShe can also block her vents. No need to shut the air off entirely. Plus, it directly effects the quality of your sleep.", "I mean on one hand 70 is a pretty significant ac temperature, but also yeah its not fair she turns it off. Yes she can use a blanket if it's too cold but also you could shift on the temp some. Or you can keep maybe 70 at sleeping hours when blankets are more easily used and switch to 73 or something during the day.\n\nI'm gonna say EAH because you both need to find middle grounds.", "\u201cableist\u201d whoever came up with that term should be sent to Siberia", "NTA\n\nAs I say always it is always easier to warm up then it is to cool down.", "NTA, look out for yourself. Who's gonna look out for you if you have to be looking out for the needy roommate.", "NTA.  That word... does not mean what she thinks it means.  If she asked you not to talk about dieting or weight issues, then fine, you should support her in that.  If you wanted the thermostat to be at 60 and she was so cold she hurt then you should accommodate that.  But 70 is in a very reasonable range.  And removing from an eating disorder does not prevent you from putting on a sweater.  \n\nIs there any way to block the AC from getting into her space?  Can you block the vent in her room or close a door?  There are magnet things you can buy to close off vents that don't have a closing lever.", "of course you are NTA. she is. Her problem is easily fixed, as you correctly pointed out, by wearing a sweater. yours cannot be, and 70 degrees is a reasonable temperature. I'm sorry you live with such a twit.", "NTA. \n\nIts 90 degrees.  She can put on a damn sweater", "Being too cold is a lot easier to deal with than the heat. Why don't she just wear more layers or blankets. I have a condition where my body can't regulate temperature, so I am very sympathetic when it comes to being too hot. NTA", "Unlike the other posts about temperature, I feel you were being really reasonable. She's very cold and you are very hot, it happens \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f the difference is that you were seeking any sort of compromise and she was refusing to even collaborate. \nI hate the idea that its easy to get hot and hard to cool down, if she is anorexic its not as simple as throwing on more clothes. The whole point of layers is to TRAP the body heat a person already produces. Someone with anorexia has poorer circulation and lower body fat which inberently affects the amount of heat she can produce. So I definitely think that shouldn't be ignored right off the bat as someone who runs cold. \n\nBut you weren't trying to ignore it, and you have needs to. If it's only on when you get home then she has all day to be warm is she wants, you don't get that option. A fair compromise miguht be to buy her a heating blanket that she can bring around the house while the A.C. is on, so you can have your cold and she can still be warm. She could also close the door to her room at night and cover the vents/holes in the door to trap the heat in. There are also sweatshirts and hoodies and vests they sell that are portable and have heating packs, i bought one for ny father once. Or get recgargeable heat packs and sew them ingo a sweater if you're on a budget. Either way, there are options between A.C. and No A.C. \n\nThere is no reason you shouldn't be able to use your own A.C. there are a CRAP ton of applicable solutions.", "I'll go with NTA, as your request is reasonable, but how you chose to communicate does not help either.\nIf you say- being cold is your problem, not mine you put yourself for the counter argument- your sensitivity to heat is your problem, not mine. \nShe can put more layers, but honestly, after what you said, I would not if I was her. Why does she need to make any effort towards you when your argument was ' your problems are not my business?'", "NTA. She needs to cover up. This is obvious. No matter how many clothes you take off, you'll still be hot. She can put on layers.", "NTA I would cover the vent in her room and maybe buy her a robe so she can be covered but comfy", "I\u2019ll say NTA. I grew up in -0 temps. Later I moved to where temps reach over 100 degrees. It\u2019s much easier to bundle up to stay warm than it is to remove layers and cool down. There\u2019s only so much removing you can do.", "Nta. She's being self centered.", "NTA. You were sensitive to her situation but you were also realistic. You can't physically do anything to make yourself cooler but she can take action to make herself warmer. \n\nI think you were being reasonable.", "nta--- she could literally put a jumper on, trying to be awkward for the sake of it", "NTA - I would say between 70 and 75 is normal and reasonable. A few things that might change my mind is like if you insist on hearing to 78 in the winter then I might think it\u2019s unreasonable to cool to 70 in the summer and you should kick in more for utilities. I would say maybe consider changing to 72.", "NTA - 70 isn't even cold. You can always put more layers on/get heaters but you were right in saying that you cant take off your skin once its too hot.", "70 is pretty cold to have AC set. Perhaps you could maintain your apartment at 75, and keep both of you happy?\n\nThe cure for your \"coming home sweaty and exhausted\" is a shower - not to dry yourself with harsh air conditioning.\n\n(And yeah, if she want to be significantly warmer than you do, she should wear a sweater, or cuddle under a blanket.

It took a while of us changing the temp to realize what was happening and we ended up all sitting together in the room and quickly came up with a solution. First, we bought two fans to help circulate the air and pointed one at the \u201chottest\u201d person\u2019s desk so they could have something to help the heat. We bought a humidifier so the fans wouldn\u2019t dehydrate all of us. And I got a plug-in hand warmer because that\u2019s where my majority heat loss related issues happened (my hands would be unable to bend from circulation issues); and I could hold it under a blanket and trap the heat inside for the night before turning it off in morning. I got a heat pad that I used on my stomach or back during the day too. (A hot water bottle was a temporary solution at one point too lol) \n\nWhen we moved and got separate rooms; the \u201chot\u201d roommate opened their AC vent, and kept fans in their room along with the humidifier. I closed my AC vent, and still used my hand warmer and heat pad. My roommates would offer to make me a warm drink if I was too cold to come out from the lil warmth bubble I made lol. \n\nThe AC isn\u2019t the end all of the situation solutions. And blankets alone or extra layers wont do much for an ED related issue. \n\nCold showers, ice packs, fans, cold drinks, close blinds in your room, cold wash rags on wrists, replace blankets with linens.

Source: I used to live in a van and I KNOW THINGS about regulating my body temp in extreme weather. \n\n**For OP:**\n\n\u2022get a cotton t-shirt soaking wet and wring it out completely, then put it on before bed. You can even stick it in the fridge or freezer for extra \u201coomph\u201d, just make sure it\u2019s really wrung out to the point where it\u2019s damp, not *wet*, or it\u2019ll freeze. You can even stash one in the fridge to change into in the middle of the night, if ya want. If it dries out and you get too hot again, re-soak and re-wrong the shirt, put it back on and go back to bed. You could also do this with a sheet or a pillowcase, but it\u2019s more of a pain with bigger items like that. \n\n\u2022Get a large camping cooler and a box fan, the window-sized kind. Fill the cooler with ice (I used $1.50 bags of ice from the gas station and a power converter hooked to my van\u2019s battery. Cheapest power bill ever.) Set the box fan on top of the open cooler. It will disperse the cold air into the room, and the fan drawing heat AWAY from the ice will keep it from melting at least throughout the night. **This is also one I highly recommend for pet owners without decent AC who are worried about keeping their pets cool while they\u2019re at work**. \n\n\u2022Ice packs. Tuck them into the underside of your pillowcase, then if you over heat, take them out and flip the pillowcase around. Just try to avoid the flimsy jelly ones that could puncture and mess up your bedding\u2014there are a lot of different kinds of ice packs out there. \n\n\u2022If you have the means, I used to work at the purple mattress store and got a DAMN good deal on a purple mattress and pillow. Haven\u2019t overheated in my sleep since and I will never ever spend money on memory foam again. Game-changer. They also take Affirm. \n\n**For OP\u2019s roommate:**\n\n\u2022Being homeless in the PNW for over a year, I can confirm that when you can feel the cold in your bones, it\u2019s pretty miserable no matter how many sweaters you wear. Ya know what actually warms those bones? **A hot bath or shower.** Literally, what I wouldn\u2019t have given for a two-minute rinse in a hot shower some of those nights. When we were camping out near a hot spring, I slept like a baby. \n\n\u2022Slippers, slippers, slippers, slippers, slippers. Socks won\u2019t cut it. You have no idea how much keeping your feet warm can help. I\u2019ve heard that even if the rets of your body is cold, keeping your and and feet warm can help because it makes it easier for your blood to circulate to the rest of your body. \n\n\u2022Flannel sheets and fleece blankets trap in warmth like nobody\u2019s business. Flannel pajamas, too. I fuckin LOVE flannel, not just as a formerly homeless person, but as someone who grew up in the Midwest near Canada, where the scientific term for our average winter weather is \u201ccold as balls\u201d. \n\n\u2022Sleep with a hat. You lose SO MUCH heat through the crown of your head, for the same reasons why you lose heat at your other extremities.

I've literally gotten freezing cold with the AC at like 74f at times, it all depends on the environment around you.", "Weird, it's the opposite for me and my husband, he's always too cold and I'm too hot.", "Do you want tornadoes? Because that\u2019s how you get tornadoes.", "The \u201cjust wear a sweater\u201d doesn\u2019t work for me.", "She could literally just open a window in her room and shut the door if it's summer time lmao or shut the vent in her bedroom, like theres super easy fixes for this. She just wants her way and doesn't care about OP.", "I live in northern Queensland in Australia and we set our ac to 24c (about 75f) overnight - any lower and it's too cold  haha. We also have our work ac set at 25c during the day and I have a cardigan and a blanket that I keep at work because it blows directly at my desk and it's freezing.  Even though the temp outside is frequently 25c and is absolutely beautiful, but feels much warmer due to very high humidity.", "Oh, I remember a holiday in the Lake district many years ago. All I can say, stunningly beautiful scenery, and thankfully the rain is warm in the summer. The youth hostel was closed during the day and so we just went walking the mountains in the rain and I could literally pour water out of my shoes after about 30 minutes. We still enjoyed ourselves. I think one day in the ten days we were there was no rain.\n\nWe have had everything between 35 and 10 during the day in the last four weeks ( Germany). Currently on holiday in Bavaria and it's just around 15 and rain all week. Apparently last week they had 37 here for a week....", "Wierdly enough, me too! I was roomates with a few friends and one of them had a sister staying with us who also had Raynauds. She would crank the thermostat to 80 fariegnheight and the most she would compromise to was 72 f in the SUMMER. My poor friends were dying, and she walked around the house naled constantly despite us asking her to stop. Like girl, I understand needing warmth, but I don't feel bad for you being cold because you're NAKED. \n\nEventually we overpowered her and just locked the thermostat at a reasonable temp for everybody.", "Ahh you enjoying our record breaking heat right now too. 76 feels cold to us lol"]}
