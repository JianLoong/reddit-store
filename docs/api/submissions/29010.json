You're not responsible for punishing her daughter. \n\nBut for future reference, if you're not there to watch someone open presents, hiding part of their gift is a bad idea. One time one of my family members taped a gift card to the bottom of a box with another present inside, and since I didn't see it, it would have gotten recycled if my dad hadn't been like: \"Is that.... \\*all\\* that was in there?\" until it occurred to me he was implying there had been 2 items inside.

Maybe she should raise her kids better? One is unappreciative and passes off gifts without even looking at it, and the other basically stole the gift card", "NTA - I'm not really sure why it's even an issue if the gift was worn, if the socks were opened, if the recipient gave the socks away as based on OP's post is was given in the spirit of a gag gift, as in they knew M wouldn't like the socks, but the expectation was that they would find the gift card or in a follow up call as above they would reveal it. I think the real question here is why anyone expects OP to pay for another card. If I accidentally throw away a gift card or money I don't expect the gift giver to replace it. In this case a younger sister found the card, knew it was not for her but spent it anyway. The issue is between the sisters and the aunt. IMHO the aunt should replace the card and take it out of the sister's allowance, or future gifts if they don't have one. Make the sister repay it by chores, whatever the case maybe. While this situation has the potential to sour the relationship between sisters, I think an honest apology from S stating that she took it, she knew it wasn't hers, but the temptation was too much, etc. And then an attempt to repay is what is needed here and will go a long way to making amends. As an individual with a sister one year older, and a brother one-year younger siblings fight, and then you make up. Either way, this sounds like a conflict in house and not OP's problem to solve.", "NTA. You gave M a gift. M gave the gift to S. The gift card now belongs to S to do with whatever she likes. Plus..

If your not used to getting stuff in socks you wouldnt think to check, and no I do not expect someone to feel up socks.\n\nHowever\n\nIt's not your fault M sister decided to use a 250$ gift card without saying a word. She found it in socks given to M, she was rather sneaky spending it silently. I'd find it weird if i got 250$ GC in a sock that was given to a sibling who then gave it to me for no reason. Like if it was also around M sister birthday then Maybe i could see it, but like this? No. \n\nNTA", "WHO COMPLAINS ABOUT A $50 GIFT CARD?!?! \n\nI would be ecstatic for any type of gift card, let alone $50!  This whole story makes me wonder what type of world we live in.

What happened to being thankful for the thought of it all? And my family wonders why I don't like Christmas. I'd rather have no gifts than to worry about the backlash of gift giving. \n\nNTA - Let the 16 year old get a job and figure out how many hours it takes to make $300 for her to spend on cosmetics.", "NTA  Sister knew full well that she was spending her sister's special gift.

I agree, the issue is your younger cousin taking the gift card, she basically lied and stole it (unless she thought her sister meant to give it to her, but then I think she would have mentioned something and the situation would have been rectified). Originally I was thinking she would accidentally have thrown it away. It was a fun cheeky joke, but maybe not the smartest to hide such a large amount of money. But at the same time, asking you to replace it is soooo out of line. I\u2019m sorry! They should be greatful you were so generous in the first place!

More importantly, by 13, S should know that the giftcard in the sock was clearly not intended for her, or to at least check with M that M knew it was there and was ok with giving it to her. S didn't and chose to steal from her sister. Your aunt also should be more aware of what her minor children are doing. How does a sudden $250 gift card not render notice? That is a lot of money for a teen, esp a young teen. Yet, mom wasn't suspicous. S should be the one that has to make that right to M, and their mother should be the one overseeing this. A good option would be for your aunt to get a replacement card, then have S apologize to M, give her the card, and work (odd jobs, babysitting, paper route etc) to pay their mom back for the cost of replacing the card.

The little sister knew full well the money was not for her, yet she kept silent and spent it anyway. She should pay it back. \n\nAlso, the mum wasn't paying any attention, was she?

But my cousin who lives two states over keeps a selection of generic cards and gift cards on hand because their expectations are different.", "ESH, except for maybe sweet 16 cousin.\n\nMy problem with OP is that she KNEW her cousin didn't like clothing for a gift. Even if a gift card is \"noticable\" in a sock, cousin may not have noticed because she is focused on the thing she detests. It wasn't a smart move on OP's part, and I feel like she is overall to blame for the situation, especially since she didn't try to quickly follow up making sure her cousin (who again she knew hated getting clothing as a gift) actually got the card and it didn't end up in the trash. While I usually don't care about how other people spend their money, OP was willing to risk essentially wasting that money because it would just be gone, thrown away. And for what? A bad joke? That's an expensive \"joke\"/pair of socks. \n\nThe younger cousin is an AH because instead of double checking if her sister meant to give her a gift card from a regifted pair of socks (she knew her sis just had her birthday and that is where the socks came from) she went and spent the money. The sister is rude and selfish. \n\nThe Aunt I don't think had a bad solution: Can you please give cousin the money back and not worry about younger cousin's birthday? However, if OP can't afford it, then she can't afford it. That isn't exactly her fault. The best (and honestly only real/ true solution) is to make the younger cousin pay her older sister back. The Aunt is an AH for trying to manipulate and guilt OP into forking out money she didn't have. OP doesn't have to do anything. She didn't have to give her cousin anything. It isn't OP's fault that younger cousin made an AH move. Aunt needs to parent her kids instead of passing the buck to someone else. \n\nOr could younger cousin return what she bought and get the money back? I don't know exactly how that works with skin care/ makeup. \n\nI don't find the older cousin to be that much of an AH because everyone has preferences when it comes to gifts. I don't mind clothes for gifts and actually love getting fuzzy socks. She has made it clear what she likes, and honestly I don't blame her for regifting something she isn't going to use or she doesn't like. People do it all the time. And honestly, if it was something I didn't care for, I probably wouldn't look much further than the one obvious gift card and the pair of socks. If I were her, I would be annoyed at OP for the stupid prank and furious that my sister just callously took my gift. \n\nI have a feeling the sisters don't think much of each other/ don't get along. I would never do that to my sister or even my brother that I never got along with. But if I had, you'd bet my parents would make me pay my sibling back.", "NTA. Sister shouldn\u2019t have spent the money, knowing it wasn\u2019t for her, mom should teach said daughter a lesson. She can do chores and earn the money to pay back her sister. \n\nThis is not your problem", "Now I\u2019m thinking about how I stole 20 bucks from my sister like a decade ago when I was a teen and got grounded for weeks. 20 dollars got you MUCH further back then than it does now, but It wasn\u2019t about the amount of money it was the entitlement of me thinking I could just take whatever I wanted. My sister started working in fast food at like 14 and did detasseling for a whole summer. Saved her money while I was a big spender. I\u2019ve got around 8,000 usd in savings now but that was from saving about 50-100 dollars almost every week for 3 years. I lived at home and had no other expenses. I spent very little because of that.\n\n250 dollars is a LARGE chunk of money. Especially for a 13yr old. That\u2019s enough money to \u201cmake or break me\u201d after all of my living expenses are paid. I\u2019m lucky if I have 80 dollars left after all of my bills, rent, and household expenses/groceries are paid for. Like WHATTHEHECK. Nta at all. Aunt should pull a freaking tom nook and make her do household tasks for like 50 cents per task until she\u2019s paid her debt, and the aunt should be the one to replace the card. S can decide if she wants to do a certain amount of chores per week and decide the time frame. She gets to decide the duration of the punishment. I do feel there are many ways that SMALLER children are actually held to a higher standard than a lot of adults. 13 is old enough for S to know what she did is not acceptable behavior. The sense of her feeling entitled to that money is what I find troubling. It was dishonest and unfair. There is no 13yr old who needs that much money. 250 dollars could cover a moderate sized vet bill for my dog.
