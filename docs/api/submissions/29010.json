The problem here is not that you played a stupid joke, it's that the younger sister, knowing the money was intended for her older sister, spent it.\n\nThat problem is your aunt's to handle; you have no responsibility.  If it fucks up their relationship, which I'm sure it will, the discipline lies in her hands, not yours.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt needs to deal with it herself. Her daughter spent the card. It's his responsibility to replace it and punish the one who spent it. \n\nIt's ludicrous that she expects you to buy another $250 gift card so she doesn't have to parent her kids.", "NTA\n\nExpecting you to cover that gift card is insane.", "NTA\n\nYour Aunt should replace it, and make S pay it back", "NTA... The aunt and her two girls need to have a family meeting (or whatever else one would call it) and discuss the events that led to the situation:\n1. M did not open her gifts properly\n2. Little sister was selfish and sneaky - she owed it to the birthday girl to tell her about the gift card\n3. Aunt is clueless how to handle the situation and the girls have this behaviour as role model behaviour\nSo they need to sort this at their end, even though your gift was the catalyst.", "NTA - the AH who spent the money should be one to replace it.", "Wow, NTA - your aunt is ridiculous. If the girls' relationship is damaged that's on the crappy little sister's head for being a sneak. She knew what she was doing. Not your fault in any way and not your responsibility to fix.", "NTA. Your aunt can replace the gift card, and take it out of S's allowance", "NTA, you are under no obligation to replace a gift card just because someone didn't check the socks before giving them away. S was given the socks and the gift card, so it was now hers to use. If your aunt is so concerned about the girls' relationship, she should replace the gift card. Demanding more from someone who already gave their gift is extremely rude.", "Definitely NTA. I seriously doubt anyone here is going to feel like you are. \n\nNTA for not giving them another gift card and NTA for giving the gift in the first place. \n\nIf someone told me I need to give someone $250 or else they don\u2019t get along, they\u2019d be getting a middle finger as an answer, and they got all sorts of other issues I got nothing to do with. \n\nAnd don\u2019t feel bad your gift led to this. I\u2019ve once given a digital picture frame to a couple and there was a big disagreement about it. I felt bad, but it was ultimately not my fault. How could I, or you for that matter have known?\n\nImagine it was a pair of shoes or a blanket that led to a fight in between the sisters. That\u2019s not on you, and it\u2019s not your job to sort it out. \n\nI\u2019d say the most you can do if you feel like it is give S the $50 card you were likely going to give her, and she can use it as part of the down payment for what she owes her sister. But once again, that\u2019s not on you. Honestly, it may be the right move not to give anything until you get an apology for the mom calling you that. \n\nLastly, don\u2019t for a second feel like the way you gifted it was the issue. Hiding it like that is kinda cute, and whatever happened after that was on the sisters.", "NTA.  A 13 year old spending up big at Sephora should have been the giveaway something was awry here.  The only AH is Sally - she should have handed over the card when she found it, but she didn't - she couldn't possibly believe for a minute that her 16 year old sister would give her a $250 gift card - it was obviously meant for the one who was given the socks.  The family can sort their own crap out here - it is not your responsibility.", "NTA - S stole from her sister and deserves to be held accountable", "It is ridiculous for your aunt to try to make you replace it like you were at fault.

She's not entitled to a do-over for what she gave away.", "NTA. If your cousin wasn't such a spoiled little turd, she would have found the gift card. It's wrong to give someone else a gift that was gotten for you in the first place, within a certain time limit. \n\nMaybe it's because I grew up dirt poor but, in my family, I was taught to be grateful for the things that others gave to me, even if I wasn't particularly fond of the gift - someone went out of their way to buy you something and give it to you while expecting nothing in return when they didn't have to do so.", "NTA\n\nAgree with top comments about aunt not doing her parenting job, but that's not your responsibility.\n\nI would point out to aunt that if S has any of those other gift cards aunt thought she had, then S can give those to M.... and any other gift cards she gets (or cash) until she returns to M the amount she needs to pay back.

M needs to learn a thing or two about gratitude (and I hope this little lesson teaches her something).

Sally should have immediately told her \"Hey, I found a gift card in the socks, do you want it?\" If Mary said no without asking what it was for or how much, then I would say she would be out of luck. But Mary literally never knew at any point it was in there and Sally 100 percent should have informed her.", "Exactly.  Far too much entitlement these days and not being grateful. Poor or not, someone takes the time to give you a gift and spend hard earn money on you, you should be grateful.  It\u2019s a gift a gesture.  It\u2019s the thought that counts. \n\nWho couldn\u2019t use a cute pair of socks?  Had she been kind about it and not just flippantly thrown them \u201caway\u201d she would have probably noticed. \n\nWith that said, the sister gave little sis the socks and since the gift card is in there it\u2019s hers. \nLike possession is 9/10th of the law. \n\nThe mum needs to sit the children down and explain to the older one why this happened. It was given to the little one as a gift!  She gladly accepted.  To bad you lose.  Sometime lessons in life are tough to learn. \n\nEveryone claiming the little one stole didn\u2019t, it was gifted to her after the bigger one didn\u2019t want it. Legally it\u2019s hers. \n\nSure, she could have given it back but that is not how life works. \n\nBe grateful for what you have and are given, you may not like it but there are better ways to handle it.\n\nThis is an important life lesson and I hope they all learn something for it. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s generational.", "What was she supposed to do, keep socks she would never wear? I\u2019d rather someone have a gift\nthey\u2019d use", "Nah she was being super entitled. Its socks not a whole outfit. She already got 50$ you can wear the socks once to show appreciation", "If Mary had been a bit more annoyed about getting socks, she might have simply tossed them in the trash. In that case, nobody would get the benefit.\n\nMy thought is that if Mary had handled the socks at all before giving them away, the presence of something in them would have been immediately obvious.\n\nFrom the posted narrative, we don't have any reason to think that Sally thought that Mary did *not* notice the card.
