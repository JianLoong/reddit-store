That sounds at best stupid and at worst intentional (like you were tryingtoteach her a lessonor something), so you are a little bit TA for that.\n\nHowever, you are not TA for not replacing it. S spent that money and needs to pay it back. If their mom wants to make that happen by her not giving S anything for her birthday and instead replacing the card, that's a great consequence.

You're not responsible for punishing her daughter. \n\nBut for future reference, if you're not there to watch someone open presents, hiding part of their gift is a bad idea. One time one of my family members taped a gift card to the bottom of a box with another present inside, and since I didn't see it, it would have gotten recycled if my dad hadn't been like: \"Is that.... \\*all\\* that was in there?\" until it occurred to me he was implying there had been 2 items inside.

Maybe she should raise her kids better? One is unappreciative and passes off gifts without even looking at it, and the other basically stole the gift card", "NTA - I'm not really sure why it's even an issue if the gift was worn, if the socks were opened, if the recipient gave the socks away as based on OP's post is was given in the spirit of a gag gift, as in they knew M wouldn't like the socks, but the expectation was that they would find the gift card or in a follow up call as above they would reveal it. I think the real question here is why anyone expects OP to pay for another card. If I accidentally throw away a gift card or money I don't expect the gift giver to replace it. In this case a younger sister found the card, knew it was not for her but spent it anyway. The issue is between the sisters and the aunt. IMHO the aunt should replace the card and take it out of the sister's allowance, or future gifts if they don't have one. Make the sister repay it by chores, whatever the case maybe. While this situation has the potential to sour the relationship between sisters, I think an honest apology from S stating that she took it, she knew it wasn't hers, but the temptation was too much, etc. And then an attempt to repay is what is needed here and will go a long way to making amends. As an individual with a sister one year older, and a brother one-year younger siblings fight, and then you make up. Either way, this sounds like a conflict in house and not OP's problem to solve.", "NTA. You gave M a gift. M gave the gift to S. The gift card now belongs to S to do with whatever she likes. Plus.. M didn't even thank you for the gift she received.

I went through a lot of socks growing up because I played outside more often than not and the creek in our backyard was my favorite place, not to mention that I also wore my socks all of the time and wore shoes as often as possible. I would have preferred Pokemon cards but, my parents were smarter than that and had family members get me things that I actually needed.\n\nI'm grateful nowadays because a lot of the clothes that I didn't want actually turned out to be the most comfortable and I ended up wearing them until they were threads.", "I never said anything about the quality of the gift.

Giving away is done so that you do not clutter own space by something you do not need and so that someone who likes the item can have use of it.\n\nIf you give someone socks they do not like, it is entitled to demand that they keep it in their drawer or use them. Accept smile and thanks, do not demand that people actually wear it.", "How old are y\u2019all? You really think she needed to call her uncle to ask if she can give her sister her socks?

This all happened because when you give prank gifts you should be there to see the reaction, if he was there he could have pointed out the gift card, it doesn\u2019t have to be a thing on how spoiled she is for not being sufficiently appreciative of a joke gift of socks.
