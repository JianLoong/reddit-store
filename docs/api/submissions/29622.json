I'll call her May. May and I have a hot/cold type relationship, but she's still my sister and I love her so of course I accepted, but let her know I get squeamish & may need to stay 'above the waist'. May acted like she totally understood this at the time. Still, she would send me home birth videos, as that was also her goal. I told her I can't watch them because it disturbs me; I don't have kids or plan to have them so I've never really felt the need to desensitive myself to this stuff. She wasn't deterred and at one point told me to grow up, childbirth is natural.\n\nThe time comes, it's just me, our mom and her team of midwives present. I'm holding one leg and our mom's holding the other. I'm HELLA uncomfortable but trying my best to support, encouraging May and telling her she's doing amazing, etc. But it gets the best of me, I feel like I'm about 2 seconds from hurling, and I excuse myself. I do come back into the bedroom but keep a bit of distance and cheer her on that way. Obviously she's busy pushing and we don't address me stepping away.\n\nMay's 2 weeks post-partum. Me, our mom, 2 of our cousins and 2 aunts are visiting. All women with kids, excited to hear her birth story, May's happy to oblige. Then she gets to the part where she mentions that I 'dropped her leg and left' while she was pushing. Mind you she never brought this up to me. But in front of our family she was acting incredibly let down by me and what happened. May and one of our cousins was insinuating I was childish for not being able to tolerate it, like 'imagine if she actually had to be the one going through it' and I was like.. yeah, I'm child-free for a reason? Their reaction made me feel really uncomfortable. May asks why couldn't you have just looked at the wall or something, and I finally just told her the reason I stepped into the other room was because she started pooping, I smelled it and saw it and just immediately felt like I was going to barf in an already intense situation. I said I would've felt like a bigger asshat if I threw up on her in that moment than if I just left to compose myself.\n\nMay got embarrassed by me saying this and EXTREMELY mad. I understand but I didn't say it in a mean way or to embarrass her - I just felt targeted and invalidated for having a human reaction, and like I had to explain/defend myself. After May's blow-up one of my cousin's said I shouldn't have told her she pooped. Another told me she understood I wasn't trying to be a bitch and that my sister's hormonal, she'll get over it. I promptly left (this was three days ago) and haven't talked to May since. Our mom has asked me to apologize. I told her I'll apologize when May apologizes for putting me on blast and mocking me. At this point, I'm fine not talking to her because I want peace and I feel like this might be something she throws in my face.

Also your sister needs to get over herself and it the baby was born safe and well you dropping her leg didn't change that! She was digging you out when you had supported her and it was unfair", "NTA. If your sister felt some type of way over you leaving the room, she should have shared that with YOU and not shame you in front of others when she never even spoke with you about it. She put YOU in the hot seat to have to defend yourself out of nowhere, and you being honest about what happened is why she ended up embarrassed. Quite frankly she deserved to get embarrassed for being needlessly rude to someone trying to support her. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yo whaaaaaaaaaat???? \n\nEntirely NTA!! \n\nAs a birthing person and parent of about to be 4, they had the utter GALL to tell you that childbirth was natural, but when you mention somethjnf that happened *thats absolutely natural and common during childbirth* they have an issue???\n\n Like, OBs will literally tell you that pooping during childbirth/pushing is *completely normal*. Why? Because the same muscles you use to push out a poop are the same muscles you use to push out a kid! Some women even say that when the head comes out it can feel like a bowel movement! Your sister needs to nut up or shut up. She doesn't get to be rude and put you on blast and kick you for, what, weeks? Because you have a squeamish stomach and can't handle childbirth which looks eerily similar to a horror movie, I get it, and then get mad when you inform her that she did something *common and natural to happen* during the same childbirth she mocked you and put you on blast for. Absolutely not. Your sister is the AH here, I don't give a damn if it's her hormones, that's not an excuse to be a shitty person to someone who tried their absolute best to be supportive and help you how you wanted them to. Maybe she should have asked her team of midwives more questions about childbirth before mocking you too, since again, it's super common. \n\nSide note: sometimes contractions can even feel like really bad gas or constipation, ironically enough, because *same muscles*.\n\nEdit: You shouldn't be made to apologize for pointing out something happened that was extremely likely to happen anyways and was \"completely natural\", to use your sisters phrase. If your sister was so well informed on childbirth prior to giving birth, she might have known how common it is and understood rather than mock you for stepping out. I knew how common and likely it was with my first kid at like 6 months along.", "It\u2019s still not clear to my why it\u2019s so important to your sister you watch intently as she tore her vag apart while she shat herself. Is this some fetish she can\u2019t confess to? NTA.", "NTA. They wouldn\u2019t let up and you snapped.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, this thing that your whole family must be with you holding your legs while you scream to push a baby out and probably also shit yourself in the process is extremely cringe and vaguely unsettling. No, the world doesn't have to suffer because you're suffering. And giving birth is not some passively accepted duty, you bring it on yourself and the blame stays among the two that conceived the kid. You're not more special for it and everyone is entitled to just not wanting to deal with a single thing related to childbirth.", "Nta\n\nYou're exactly right, it would have been much worse to vomit on her while she was giving birth than it was to excuse yourself. \n\nI don't think you have anything to apologize for. I know you couldn't pay me to be in a room with someone who was giving birth. No thanks. I too am child free and everything to do with birth seems horrifying to me, so you're stronger than I am for making it as far as you did. \n\nThe hormones are legit raging so maybe give her some space and see if she comes around. I don't think you did anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nNumber one rule of supporting someone going through a Medical Moment: don\u2019t become a patient yourself. You did what you needed to do to keep the professionals focused on May rather than your own emotions (and fluids).\n\nDespite ample forewarning of how exposing you to birth was likely to go, she can still be disappointed with how things turned out; life isn\u2019t always what we hope for. However, she should have brought it up with you separately. The way she handled it made it clear her purpose was to shame you, not to resolve lingering feelings. By that point, she backed you into a corner, and while you might not have been the most tactful, I can\u2019t fault you for explaining your actions.", "NTA\n\nYour sister tried to throw you under the bus and you rightfully brought her down with you. She should definitely apologize to you for trying to make you look bad. Also, why is she upset about the pooping thing? From what I hear, it's actually quite common for this to happen during birth (I don't have a child but I watch medical stuff).", "NTA, I\u2019m also just heavily confused as to why your sister was expecting you to gaze at her in some kind of awe potentially ripping herself in half, screaming and shitting.\n\nI feel like there\u2019s so many questions to be asked\u2026. A lot of women poop while giving birth \u2014 Did SHE watch the birth videos? \n\nIf you don\u2019t find it beautiful, You just don\u2019t. No shame for that.", "NTA This is why one must communicate and make sure you don\u2019t have any misunderstandings before essentially gossiping.", "NTA\n\nThere's a reason why my sister never asked me to be present during birth for her 2 kids, nor my niece for when she gave birth (I'm the god mother for her daughter, decided even before birth). Because as much as I can handle gore and stuff, 100% I'd pass out.\n\nIt's normal that a poop happens, and your sister probably shouldn't have insisted on you being there, knowing you're squeamish. Being an overthinker, I can't help but wonder if she did just so that she'd get some ammo that she could use to embarrass you with, or put you on blast as a \"unsupportive sister\". Again, I'm most likely overthinking it, but I've known people like that.\n\nYou didn't do it to be mean, and the \"evil\" side of me thinks that your sister had it coming, she was going after you, even while knowing about your squeamishness, so it does kind of feel targeted (also kinda a little like bullying). Yes she's hormonal and all, but not everything can be explained away with that.", "Why the fuck does she need two people for support if it's such an easy \"natural\" thing to do? She should be able to easily do it herself, so it's pretty rediculous for her not to accept, that you don't want to be live in a Horror movie-splatter scene. \n\nWhy is she mad that you said, she pooped, if it's so normal?\n\nShe expects support and kindness from all others and has none to give to others herself.\n\nNTA.", "NTA she  to Bullied you into helping her Delivery and then tried to shame you in Front of the whole Family. You have the right to make your own decissions and to protected yourself from her harming you", "I shouldn\u2019t be laughing. But alas.

You\u2019re NTA but don\u2019t put yourself in positions that make you sick/uncomfortable, if you can help it.)", "dont push for anwsers  you dont want to get. birth is nothing wonderful. its a dirty, bloody, smelly mess full with excrements and stuff. thats how it really is. nobody talks about that. nobody should care about that as it is a natural thing. but also noone is forced to stay unless its the midwive/doc/women giving birth. \n\nNTA", "So, she\u2019d have preferred you to stay there and barf?? NTA", "Tell her to grow up, pooping is natural. NTA", "NTA, people don\u2019t get mad at men who pass out or step out cause they can\u2019t handle it like this.

Why wasn\u2019t HE doing any of the helping/encouraging/holding?  And does May hold him to the same standards she holds OP?\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext time, don't be there when she gives birth. thiis is ridiculous. She sure knows hoew to manipulate and guilt you.", "There is a reason. Midwives,duulas, and maternity doctors exist.. overseeing a safe child birth takes experience and a strong stomach. It's more thelan reasonable  to ask family to be nearby for support. But it was unfair for her to force you into a position you were not prepared or able to be present for.\nLet her cool down and give her a chance to rethink where she actually stands in this argument.

But give time to your sister to process everything. You dont need to apologize. You only told the true.", "I have 2 kids and I've never watched a single birth video. My husband watched them.

Not everyone wants to \u201cshare the miracle of birth\u201d\u2026.", "NTA. She thought it was fine and dandy to embarrass YOU and put you on blast, but then it's not okay for you to \"embarrass\" her and defend yourself? I don't think so. \n\nYou told her multiple times ahead of time you'd probably have to step away. You didn't just suddenly disappear without warning.", "NTA but I find this a super weird story because\n\n1) I feel like a team of midwives would have advised against having the sister there and would have suggested she leave when they saw her discomfort and \n\n2) I've never heard of a woman having a home birth and giving birth on her back.  People usually have home births in part to avoid that position.", "I would just keep saying, did you want me to throw up on your new baby?

While childbirth is natural, so is pooing whilst you do, it's just the midwives and doctors are very discrete about it and don't say anything. Anyway I've got kids and my sister is like you, childfree and has no desire to see anyone give birth, and I wouldn't want her in there because she would have a similar reaction to you.", "NTA- I literally just had my second baby a week ago. I can\u2019t imagine pressuring someone to be there who was that uncomfortable with it and then mocking them for stepping away. It\u2019s not like it should have been a surprise that you needed a breather. Lots of support people faint, what if that had happened?

It is by no means shameful or disrespectful to be made uncomfortable by this.\nAdd to the fact you are essentially staring at your sisters private parts and this whole thing is just weird!", "I'm confused by all the N T As. You knew you couldn't handle seeing a live birth, but still agreed to go through with it, then stepped out during a crucial part of the birthing process and later embarrassed your sister in front of family, when she voiced her disappointment. What the hell?!\n\nESH, mostly you for agreeing to be present at all, your sister for insisting you be there, when she knew you were uncomfortable with it.", " NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Childbirth isn't magical, beautiful or serene. It's fucking disgusting and full-on.

You say you \u201cfelt targeted and invalidated for having a human reaction\u201d, yet you 100% did the same to her! May obviously assumed you could handle it, because you agreed to do it. You couldn\u2019t handle it and when she called you out on it, you divulged information you had no right to make public about her birth. And you could have defended yourself without disclosing any info of the birth.

You owe her an apology.", "YTA. She asked for your support and you literally let her down. Pooping in childbirth is normal. You would have known that if you prepared.

I don't think you should've agreed to be there if you couldn't handle it.

I've heard and know too many things.", "ESH - two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. Sure, she didn\u2019t respect your boundaries and tried to put you on blast. But why would you tell her that she pooped, especially in front of other people? Even though it\u2019s a natural part of childbirth, everybody knows that women feel shameful about it, and you even added that it smelled bad ? Everybody knows that poop smell bad you don\u2019t have to insist on it.\nAlso it was very nice of you to try to be there for your sister but I think you should have just refused to be in the room since you knew that it would be difficult for you, it\u2019s okay to say no", "YTA for saying yes in the first place. If you knew you couldn't hack it you should have been upfront and said no. Bailing in the middle of one of the most difficult things she'll ever do is not a good look, and spilling about the poop was also unnecessary, you could have just said it was all too much for you.", "NTA; you were forced into saying so. Can\u2019t blame her for being mad you dropped the leg though; that affected her ability to push. Being present is one thing, but knowing you\u2019re squeamish, you should have not agreed to hold the leg.

Jk, entirely NTA and this is weird af that she is insulted why you didn\u2019t want to watch her vag and rectum do their thing.", "NAH \n\nShe\u2019s reeling from childbirth which, even when it goes well, is its own sort of trauma. \n\nYou did the right thing. \n\nThat said I think you also needed to insist you not be there in that capacity at all. When you\u2019re there, midwives are gonna ask you to grab a leg. You didn\u2019t know that- I wish you\u2019d researched what might be asked of you.", "YTA, you know you left because you couldn't handle it, which is fair enough, its a rough process and new to you, but it's also OK for her to feel a little let down and to say that to you without you embarrassing her about her labour.", "YTA. You should be able to tolerate mild ribbing without sharing private and embarrassing medical info.", "I'm conflicted because it seems that the best thing would've been for you not to be there in the first place. I understand why you initially accepted, but once you realized that your sister doesn't respect your boundaries about this, there should've been a talk between the two of you where the two of you set clear expectations of what you would and would not do, or even for you to make it clear that you will not be able to be part of it after all. \n\nGenerally, I'm on your side, and it's extremely disrespectful of them to talk to you that way for a completely normal reaction to childbirth. \n\nHowever, bringing up the poop is where the issue is, because your sister probably doesn't even know she did that and it's also irrelevant to the birth story and will now taint hers and the rest of the family's idea of it. \n\nYTA for telling them about it, so I'd make an apology to your sister about that, but tell her that the way she has been treating you during this time is unacceptable and that you will be less supportive of her in the future if she keeps disrespecting your boundaries. You're not TA for walking out.", "ESH, but your sister way more than you. You didn't have to say that she pooped, and I understand why she felt embarrassed. You could just have said that you felt nauseaus and had to take a break.

He still likes to through it my way when the topic comes up \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  I now know what i have to look for the next time XD", "I was very well informed and unfortunately had both my sons flat on my back", "I read it that the while the sister may have known it was common to poop she maybe didn't know she pooped (midwives did take care of it and not mention but that didn't stop op from seeing it while holding sisters leg) and was embarrassed by the way op brought it up.  Which yeah it's a bodily function that is gross even if it is natural especially in childbirth but it can still be embarrassing to know that everyone saw you do it.   The issue wasn't that she pooped its that it was put in her face that she did even though she was the one pushing op as to why they couldn't handle seeing childbirth", "Yea I just had a baby in August and I didn't even want to be there! They asked if I wanted to feel the head and I yelled no! My husband had to be cajoled into cutting the cord. We love the baby and we're very excited about her but that's a day we could both have done without.", "I'm cf but I would imagine that if you could skip pregnancy and childbirth and just be handed a baby, at least 90% would take that deal. \n\nLike I seriously doubt anyone would want to go through pregnancy if it wasn't the only way to get a baby to exist. I get it's natural, but that doesn't mean natural stuff isn't gross or horrifying. My period is natural but I think it's gross and I'm not gonna force friends and family to look at bloody pads or stained underwear", "Same, mom of 4, wouldn't \"force\" or guilt anyone to be in there at that time.\n\nAnd if anything would expect birth to turn others off of having kids ever.... I know my pregnancy/birthing stories have helped people get out of baby fever.....", "I pushed back against the lady who ran the birthing class who said I had to watch the childbirth video.  I wasn't going to be able to see what was going on when I had the baby, I don't see what watching someone else do it is gonna help.  I was gonna have the cheap seat. \n\nYea, I wanted a kid, but seeing that video was pretty much the most de motivating part of the entire process.", "Two of the people at my birth became childfree because of what they saw.  One had wanted to be a mom her entire life and suddenly was like nope.  The other was actively trying and stopped and made her husband wear condoms after that.", "I have 2 kids, born vaginally unmedicated.  It was a means to an end. There was very little about it that was \"beautiful\".  The process got the infants out of me. Job done.  I applaud those who see it as a wonderful experience and celebrate how happy it makes them. Me?  Nope.  It got'em out and we started our lives together.", "Sister was not abandoned, she had her mom and a team of midwives with her. Like OP said, it was better for her to leave and compose herself quickly rather than stay and risk puking. Imagine welcoming your nibling into the world by throwing up on their head as they came out of their mom's vagina.", "Op told her sister before hand that while she wanted to support her that she may not be able to handle everything. Her Mom was still there so it\u2019s not as if she was left alone and in reality if a doctor or nurse sees a support person looking pale, like they may faint or vomit they will be ran out so that way they can focus on mom. So op did the best thing possible and took a minute and then came back to support her the best she could.", "3 hours and 17 minutes of pushing without an epidural and 37 stitches inside and outside. The threat of a c-section was enough to finally get her out \ud83d\ude02", "I'm so sorry you went through that! That sounds like hell.", "The sister acted like it wasn't even a conceivable possibility when OP mentioned it, which is where I have an issue.  Even though again, team of midwives, knowledgeable about home births, and had sent OP videos of childbirth to watch, some of which probably had women doing exactly that, there's no way she didn't know it was a possibility or common. \n\nSister spent how many months ribbing, mocking, and full out bullying OP about being squeamish about childbirth? Using the phrase, \"get over it\" because it's \"completely natural\" and then jumped OP during a visit, allowed others there to mock, bully, berate, and rib at OP, when OP's reaction was natural and valid because OP *didn't* know that was a possibility during childbirth, since they choose to be child free. \n\nAlso it never says anywhere that this happened during a dinner, or in front of the entire family. So that's a moot point. It was a 2 week post partum visit, in front of 3 women who had kids themselves, and was started by the sister jumping OP, and when OP rightfully defended themselves and explained *why* they left to compose themselves, after 4 people backed them into a corner, then it's a problem?", "But people poop during birth. Like a lot. Like most people. So how is it embarrassing to say that someone pooped and you needed to leave vs someone gushed fluids and it was a lot so you needed to leave. Both things happen during birth.", "raw beef shouldnt smell strongly (i know that it's prepared different in the US but surely it doesn't smell more than a light meat smell?)", "Yeah amniotic fluid smells so bad. I remember smelling mine and wanted to hurl!", "I know a lot of midwives, and yeah they all hate it too. You apparently never get used to it, you just no longer feel sick around it. Still smells gross though.", "My water broke at home in bed and I gathered the sheets to toss in the wash before I went to the hospital. Gave them a sniff (because: curiosity) and they just smelled like salt water? Nothing gross at all.\n\nSometimes before birth the baby poops and the meconium can get into the amniotic fluid; perhaps that was it. But that usually indicates an emergency birth I think. Someone with actual Dr or nursing experience can correct or expound on this!", "Well I don't know how I could have avoided it as I was the one with the human being exiting me... but generally yes you are correct.\n\nHaving said that though, we have been lying for a long time about the realities of pregancy/birth/early parenthood so many don't realise just how gory it all is.", "Mulled wine? In October? You rebel...", "Mine started at around 6pm the day before, we went to the hospital at like 6am-7am the morning after. I definitely remember being really upset that my favorite sweatpants got ruined by blood. I ended up throwing a steel toe shoe at my poor hubs because he wouldn't wake up \ud83d\ude05 never fails to remind me I missed the first 3 times though.", "I had a nurse offer me a mirror to watch as I pushed my baby out. Oh hell no, I don't want to see my vag being shredded. No thanks.", "This reminds of the professor for my child development psychology class in university who just played a birthing video with zero warning or build up as part of a mandatory lecture. Like one second it was a completely normal text slide and the next footage of crowning baby on a movie theatre size screen. Horrifying.", "My husband and I watched a video of a woman pushing her baby out on YouTube when I was 8 months pregnant. I deeply regretted it lol. I mean, I watched it in sex ed classes but it had been ages and I'd forgotten. And witnessing it in real life is way more intense.", "Wow! Hopefully you are now okay!", "Like I said in my original comment, I'm on OP's side for leaving during the birth. I'm on OPs side for defening herself, and I agree everyone was being rude as hell to OP, The only thing I said is that she probably shouldn't have mentioned the poop in front of everyone. And no where does the sister act like she didn't know she *could* poop during the birth. It just says she was extremely embarrassed when OP mentioned it, which makes sense, even if she had known about it. No one wants to think about that part because it is (as OP already pointed out) gross, regardless of whether it's normal or not.\n\nAnd for the last point, I had just misremembered, and I've changed the comment now to say visit instead of dinner.", "[deleted]", "The really fresh, straight from the farm beef smells really strong if all you are used to is the supermarket stuff. Some of my family loves it, but to me it's utterly nauseating.", "Mine had meconium in it. It was unpleasant :/", "You\u2019re replying to a bot comment. They copied half of one that was posted further down.", "Germany \u2728", "I didn't catch a wink of sleep that night, water broke at 7am and she was there at 9am. But that one sentence is something that he's never gonna let me live down \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I'd just got into bed and snuggled down when I felt my waters go. I shook Mr Batty, who was already fast asleep, and asked him to get me a bath towel. He got up, got me a bath towel, got back into bed and settled down again...", "But, my point is that mentioning \"you pooped and I couldn't handle it\" was literally OP's defense in the entire matter. Whether it embarrassed the sister or not, that's the entire defense, so it had to be mentioned, and because it was everyone being rude and coming for OP for the same reasons because sister mentioned it, so it got mentioned in front of everyone.", "If it's such a sensitive time how about she keeps it to herself until she's less sensitive then?\nShe was publicly giving her sister shit for leaving the room. She made her sister part of her birth experience, she didn't have to be there, didn't even sound like she wanted to be there that much. \nDon't want people to talk about the fact that you pooped don't invite them to witness it. \nSimple. \nI'm not sure why people are turning such a horror show into a spectator sport or group activity anyways. \nWant to keep it private limit who is in the room. \n\nNot to mention that it just further sanitizes the entire thing. It's not magical and sacred. It's feral and wild and primal. Women would likely be better off just normalizing the poop instead of starting a family feud over it. Not like the baby isn't going to literally shit all over everything for years now anyways.", "I know what you mean. It\u2019s not a STINKY or rotting smell or anything, it\u2019s just a really heavy iron kind of smell. It\u2019s not actively bad but I don\u2019t enjoy it.", "i buy from a farm regularly as I travel regionally for work once a month. And when I visit family in Europe it's all basically fresh from the next village and doesn't stink...  \n\n\nonly the cheap supermarket stuff here USED to stink pre maybe 2005 before they get even more tough on the meat handling.  \n\n\n(Im from Aus in case we're from the same place, and I am frequently referred to as a \"sniffer dog\" by everyone and lots of smells make me gag hahhaha but happy to hear your counterviews if you're from Aus too!)", "Username checks out", "Ah, in which case, I'm jealous.", "The perfection of this reply", "NTA\n\nIt really bothers me to think that your entire family is standing there supporting your legs as you scream to get the baby out and possibly end up kicking yourself in the process.", "Of the mulled juice or the country?! The mulled juice is fabulous, I highly recommend", "The mulled juice (what's in non alcoholic mulled wine? Am seriously tempted to give it a try - my daughter can't drink wine)\n\nHave never been to Germany, so I don't know whether to be jealous or not...!", "Let me retrieve the packet and translate.\n\nSo, we have:\nApple juice, elderberry juice, sour cherry juice, grape juice concentrate, mulled wine \u201cjuice\u201d (cloves, rose hips, apple pieces, hibiscus flower, star anise, lemon peel, orange peel, redbush tea, Ceylon cinnamon, bourbon vanilla, currants).\n\nI bet if you had the spice mix or perhaps the whole spices to steep/cook in, and stirred it up with some juice it would be very good! \n\nTheir Christmas cookies are good. And the economy. But otherwise I\u2019m still unsure about it as a country. I miss spicy food"]}
