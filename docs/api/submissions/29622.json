I'll call her May. May and I have a hot/cold type relationship, but she's still my sister and I love her so of course I accepted, but let her know I get squeamish & may need to stay 'above the waist'. May acted like she totally understood this at the time. Still, she would send me home birth videos, as that was also her goal. I told her I can't watch them because it disturbs me; I don't have kids or plan to have them so I've never really felt the need to desensitive myself to this stuff. She wasn't deterred and at one point told me to grow up, childbirth is natural.\n\nThe time comes, it's just me, our mom and her team of midwives present. I'm holding one leg and our mom's holding the other. I'm HELLA uncomfortable but trying my best to support, encouraging May and telling her she's doing amazing, etc. But it gets the best of me, I feel like I'm about 2 seconds from hurling, and I excuse myself. I do come back into the bedroom but keep a bit of distance and cheer her on that way. Obviously she's busy pushing and we don't address me stepping away.\n\nMay's 2 weeks post-partum. Me, our mom, 2 of our cousins and 2 aunts are visiting. All women with kids, excited to hear her birth story, May's happy to oblige. Then she gets to the part where she mentions that I 'dropped her leg and left' while she was pushing. Mind you she never brought this up to me. But in front of our family she was acting incredibly let down by me and what happened. May and one of our cousins was insinuating I was childish for not being able to tolerate it, like 'imagine if she actually had to be the one going through it' and I was like.. yeah, I'm child-free for a reason? Their reaction made me feel really uncomfortable. May asks why couldn't you have just looked at the wall or something, and I finally just told her the reason I stepped into the other room was because she started pooping, I smelled it and saw it and just immediately felt like I was going to barf in an already intense situation. I said I would've felt like a bigger asshat if I threw up on her in that moment than if I just left to compose myself.\n\nMay got embarrassed by me saying this and EXTREMELY mad. I understand but I didn't say it in a mean way or to embarrass her - I just felt targeted and invalidated for having a human reaction, and like I had to explain/defend myself. After May's blow-up one of my cousin's said I shouldn't have told her she pooped. Another told me she understood I wasn't trying to be a bitch and that my sister's hormonal, she'll get over it. I promptly left (this was three days ago) and haven't talked to May since. Our mom has asked me to apologize. I told her I'll apologize when May apologizes for putting me on blast and mocking me.

Also your sister needs to get over herself and it the baby was born safe and well you dropping her leg didn't change that! She was digging you out when you had supported her and it was unfair", "NTA. If your sister felt some type of way over you leaving the room, she should have shared that with YOU and not shame you in front of others when she never even spoke with you about it. She put YOU in the hot seat to have to defend yourself out of nowhere, and you being honest about what happened is why she ended up embarrassed. Quite frankly she deserved to get embarrassed for being needlessly rude to someone trying to support her. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yo whaaaaaaaaaat???? \n\nEntirely NTA!! \n\nAs a birthing person and parent of about to be 4, they had the utter GALL to tell you that childbirth was natural, but when you mention somethjnf that happened *thats absolutely natural and common during childbirth* they have an issue???\n\n Like, OBs will literally tell you that pooping during childbirth/pushing is *completely normal*. Why? Because the same muscles you use to push out a poop are the same muscles you use to push out a kid! Some women even say that when the head comes out it can feel like a bowel movement! Your sister needs to nut up or shut up. She doesn't get to be rude and put you on blast and kick you for, what, weeks? Because you have a squeamish stomach and can't handle childbirth which looks eerily similar to a horror movie, I get it, and then get mad when you inform her that she did something *common and natural to happen* during the same childbirth she mocked you and put you on blast for. Absolutely not. Your sister is the AH here, I don't give a damn if it's her hormones, that's not an excuse to be a shitty person to someone who tried their absolute best to be supportive and help you how you wanted them to. Maybe she should have asked her team of midwives more questions about childbirth before mocking you too, since again, it's super common. \n\nSide note: sometimes contractions can even feel like really bad gas or constipation, ironically enough, because *same muscles*.\n\nEdit: You shouldn't be made to apologize for pointing out something happened that was extremely likely to happen anyways and was \"completely natural\", to use your sisters phrase. If your sister was so well informed on childbirth prior to giving birth, she might have known how common it is and understood rather than mock you for stepping out. I knew how common and likely it was with my first kid at like 6 months along.", "It\u2019s still not clear to my why it\u2019s so important to your sister you watch intently as she tore her vag apart while she shat herself. Is this some fetish she can\u2019t confess to? NTA.", "NTA. They wouldn\u2019t let up and you snapped.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, this thing that your whole family must be with you holding your legs while you scream to push a baby out and probably also shit yourself in the process is extremely cringe and vaguely unsettling. No, the world doesn't have to suffer because you're suffering. And giving birth is not some passively accepted duty, you bring it on yourself and the blame stays among the two that conceived the kid. You're not more special for it and everyone is entitled to just not wanting to deal with a single thing related to childbirth.", "Nta\n\nYou're exactly right, it would have been much worse to vomit on her while she was giving birth than it was to excuse yourself. \n\nI don't think you have anything to apologize for. I know you couldn't pay me to be in a room with someone who was giving birth. No thanks. I too am child free and everything to do with birth seems horrifying to me, so you're stronger than I am for making it as far as you did. \n\nThe hormones are legit raging so maybe give her some space and see if she comes around. I don't think you did anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nNumber one rule of supporting someone going through a Medical Moment: don\u2019t become a patient yourself. You did what you needed to do to keep the professionals focused on May rather than your own emotions (and fluids).\n\nDespite ample forewarning of how exposing you to birth was likely to go, she can still be disappointed with how things turned out; life isn\u2019t always what we hope for. However, she should have brought it up with you separately. The way she handled it made it clear her purpose was to shame you, not to resolve lingering feelings. By that point, she backed you into a corner, and while you might not have been the most tactful, I can\u2019t fault you for explaining your actions.", "NTA\n\nYour sister tried to throw you under the bus and you rightfully brought her down with you. She should definitely apologize to you for trying to make you look bad. Also, why is she upset about the pooping thing? From what I hear, it's actually quite common for this to happen during birth (I don't have a child but I watch medical stuff).", "NTA, I\u2019m also just heavily confused as to why your sister was expecting you to gaze at her in some kind of awe potentially ripping herself in half, screaming and shitting.\n\nI feel like there\u2019s so many questions to be asked\u2026. A lot of women poop while giving birth \u2014 Did SHE watch the birth videos? \n\nIf you don\u2019t find it beautiful, You just don\u2019t. No shame for that.", "NTA This is why one must communicate and make sure you don\u2019t have any misunderstandings before essentially gossiping.", "NTA\n\nThere's a reason why my sister never asked me to be present during birth for her 2 kids, nor my niece for when she gave birth (I'm the god mother for her daughter, decided even before birth). Because as much as I can handle gore and stuff, 100% I'd pass out.\n\nIt's normal that a poop happens, and your sister probably shouldn't have insisted on you being there, knowing you're squeamish. Being an overthinker, I can't help but wonder if she did just so that she'd get some ammo that she could use to embarrass you with, or put you on blast as a \"unsupportive sister\". Again, I'm most likely overthinking it, but I've known people like that.\n\nYou didn't do it to be mean, and the \"evil\" side of me thinks that your sister had it coming, she was going after you, even while knowing about your squeamishness, so it does kind of feel targeted (also kinda a little like bullying). Yes she's hormonal and all, but not everything can be explained away with that.", "Why the fuck does she need two people for support if it's such an easy \"natural\" thing to do? She should be able to easily do it herself, so it's pretty rediculous for her not to accept, that you don't want to be live in a Horror movie-splatter scene. \n\nWhy is she mad that you said, she pooped, if it's so normal?\n\nShe expects support and kindness from all others and has none to give to others herself.\n\nNTA.", "NTA she  to Bullied you into helping her Delivery and then tried to shame you in Front of the whole Family. You have the right to make your own decissions and to protected yourself from her harming you", "I shouldn\u2019t be laughing. But alas. (You probably should have avoided the whole \u201cbeing an active participant in the birth process\u201d thing. You\u2019re NTA but don\u2019t put yourself in positions that make you sick/uncomfortable, if you can help it.)", "dont push for answers  you dont want to get. birth is nothing wonderful. its a dirty, bloody, smelly mess full with excrements and stuff. thats how it really is. nobody talks about that. nobody should care about that as it is a natural thing. but also noone is forced to stay unless its the midwive/doc/women giving birth.\n\nNTA", "So, she\u2019d have preferred you to stay there and barf?? NTA", "Tell her to grow up, pooping is natural. NTA", "NTA, people don\u2019t get mad at men who pass out or step out cause they can\u2019t handle it like this. Why is OP when she\u2019s a woman?", "NTA - I got sick by just reading this story", "Where was the baby\u2019s father during all this?  Why wasn\u2019t HE doing any of the helping/encouraging/holding?  And does May hold him to the same standards she holds OP?\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext time, don't be there when she gives birth. thiis is ridiculous. She sure knows hoew to manipulate and guilt you.", "There is a reason. Midwives,duulas, and maternity doctors exist.. overseeing a safe child birth takes experience and a strong stomach. It's more thelan reasonable  to ask family to be nearby for support. But it was unfair for her to force you into a position you were not prepared or able to be present for.\nLet her cool down and give her a chance to rethink where she actually stands in this argument. And tell everyone else trying jump your throat over this incident to back the hell off.\nN.T.A", "Your sister sounds controlling, who in their right mind browbeats someone into watching them give birth?", "Natural does not equal pleasant or even neutral. So many natural processes are gross, and your sister clearly agrees because she got all embarrassed about pooping while giving birth.\n\nNTA and I think a lesson for the future is to avoid a situation like this all together.", "NTA", "NTA...you just defended yourself. But give time to your sister to process everything. You dont need to apologize. You only told the true.", "I have 2 kids and I've never watched a single birth video. My husband watched them. All I asked was that he avoided watching our daughter coming out of the birth canal and just let the midwife do her job. NTA", "Sis needs to stop.   Not everyone wants to \u201cshare the miracle of birth\u201d\u2026.", "NTA. She thought it was fine and dandy to embarrass YOU and put you on blast, but then it's not okay for you to \"embarrass\" her and defend yourself? I don't think so. \n\nYou told her multiple times ahead of time you'd probably have to step away. You didn't just suddenly disappear without warning.", "NTA but I find this a super weird story because\n\n1) I feel like a team of midwives would have advised against having the sister there and would have suggested she leave when they saw her discomfort and \n\n2) I've never heard of a woman having a home birth and giving birth on her back.  People usually have home births in part to avoid that position.", "I would just keep saying, did you want me to throw up on your new baby?

You told her that you were uncomfortable with the situation.", "Nta!

While childbirth is natural, so is pooing whilst you do, it's just the midwives and doctors are very discrete about it and don't say anything. Anyway I've got kids and my sister is like you, childfree and has no desire to see anyone give birth, and I wouldn't want her in there because she would have a similar reaction to you.", "NTA- I literally just had my second baby a week ago. I can\u2019t imagine pressuring someone to be there who was that uncomfortable with it and then mocking them for stepping away. It\u2019s not like it should have been a surprise that you needed a breather. Lots of support people faint, what if that had happened? I went through it and I don\u2019t know if I could be a support person and not need a moment to compose myself.", "NTA. \n\nImagine the story if you hadn\u2019t left. \n\n\u201cAnd then she vomited all over my belly and it ran down onto the baby\u2019s head.

It is by no means shameful or disrespectful to be made uncomfortable by this.\nAdd to the fact you are essentially staring at your sisters private parts and this whole thing is just weird!", "I'm confused by all the N T As. You knew you couldn't handle seeing a live birth, but still agreed to go through with it, then stepped out during a crucial part of the birthing process and later embarrassed your sister in front of family, when she voiced her disappointment. What the hell?!\n\nESH, mostly you for agreeing to be present at all, your sister for insisting you be there, when she knew you were uncomfortable with it.", " NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Childbirth isn't magical, beautiful or serene. It's fucking disgusting and full-on. The unfiltered oxytocin going through mum is what makes her forget the gore, it's not that pretty for anyone else witnessing and her reaction to you feeling ill makes me question if she's mature enough to be a parent in the first place.", "NTA, even dads (who are supposedly also prepared for this or MUST be there) faint, faint!!! lol, birthing is a HUGE messy and sometimes traumatizing experience, so it\u2019s normal not be prepared for it, like ever, my mom had all 4 of us as natural births and every time she arrived to the hospital she felt it was like the first time so don\u2019t worry.", "Don\u2019t start none, won\u2019t be none.

You say you \u201cfelt targeted and invalidated for having a human reaction\u201d, yet you 100% did the same to her! May obviously assumed you could handle it, because you agreed to do it. You couldn\u2019t handle it and when she called you out on it, you divulged information you had no right to make public about her birth. And you could have defended yourself without disclosing any info of the birth. You could have just said it was more than you expected, it was really intense, it was your first time etc. You built up expectations, couldn\u2019t hack it and when called out, you lashed out. You owe her an apology.", "YTA. She asked for your support and you literally let her down. Pooping in childbirth is normal. You would have known that if you prepared. YTA for not taking her request seriously and evaluating if you could/could not do it. And then you shamed her. You sound petty and selfish.", "YTA. I don't think you should've agreed to be there if you couldn't handle it.

You could've asked someone else to hold it.\n\nI don't have any children. I don't even like watching birth scenes on television. I would also never volunteer to be with anyone giving birth. I've heard and know too many things.", "ESH - two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. Sure, she didn\u2019t respect your boundaries and tried to put you on blast. But why would you tell her that she pooped, especially in front of other people? Even though it\u2019s a natural part of childbirth, everybody knows that women feel shameful about it, and you even added that it smelled bad ? Everybody knows that poop smell bad you don\u2019t have to insist on it.\nAlso it was very nice of you to try to be there for your sister but I think you should have just refused to be in the room since you knew that it would be difficult for you, it\u2019s okay to say no", "YTA for saying yes in the first place. If you knew you couldn't hack it you should have been upfront and said no. Bailing in the middle of one of the most difficult things she'll ever do is not a good look, and spilling about the poop was also unnecessary, you could have just said it was all too much for you.", "NTA; you were forced into saying so. Can\u2019t blame her for being mad you dropped the leg though; that affected her ability to push. Being present is one thing, but knowing you\u2019re squeamish, you should have not agreed to hold the leg. Seems strange that the midwives put her on her back but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA. \n\n\nHA! Jk, entirely NTA and this is weird af that she is insulted why you didn\u2019t want to watch her vag and rectum do their thing.", "NAH \n\nShe\u2019s reeling from childbirth which, even when it goes well, is its own sort of trauma. \n\nYou did the right thing. \n\nThat said I think you also needed to insist you not be there in that capacity at all. When you\u2019re there, midwives are gonna ask you to grab a leg. You didn\u2019t know that- I wish you\u2019d researched what might be asked of you.", "YTA, you know you left because you couldn't handle it, which is fair enough, its a rough process and new to you, but it's also OK for her to feel a little let down and to say that to you without you embarrassing her about her labour.", "YTA. You should be able to tolerate mild ribbing without sharing private and embarrassing medical info.", "I'm conflicted because it seems that the best thing would've been for you not to be there in the first place. I understand why you initially accepted, but once you realized that your sister doesn't respect your boundaries about this, there should've been a talk between the two of you where the two of you set clear expectations of what you would and would not do, or even for you to make it clear that you will not be able to be part of it after all. \n\nGenerally, I'm on your side, and it's extremely disrespectful of them to talk to you that way for a completely normal reaction to childbirth. \n\nHowever, bringing up the poop is where the issue is, because your sister probably doesn't even know she did that and it's also irrelevant to the birth story and will now taint hers and the rest of the family's idea of it. \n\nYTA for telling them about it, so I'd make an apology to your sister about that, but tell her that the way she has been treating you during this time is unacceptable and that you will be less supportive of her in the future if she keeps disrespecting your boundaries. You're not TA for walking out.", "ESH, but your sister way more than you. You didn't have to say that she pooped, and I understand why she felt embarrassed. You could just have said that you felt nauseaus and had to take a break.

N.T.A. N-FREAKING-T-A. I can sit though surgical procedures and births, have vomit, urine, and fecal matter ALL over me, and I'm fine with that. But that's the thing: I'm fine with it. Absolutely no one has the right to try to force you into situations in which you are uncomfortable, especially, like your sister, when they expect you to take an ACTIVE ROLE.\n\nYou were very clear from the beginning that you were uncomfortable, and your sister massively overstepped boundaries by having you \"below the waist\" at any point. In fact, I'm actually pretty impressed at how you handled the situation. It's INCREDIBLY common for people to freak out, vomit, or even pass out in these types of situations- it's a normal response to a stressful environment (and nothing anyone can be blamed for btw). The fact that you were mentally present and could tell you had reached the end of your tolerance and calmly removed yourself from the situation is the best thing you could do. Birthing, done anywhere, is a medical procedure, and the last thing anyone pushing a ~7lb melon out of their birth canal would need is someone (even in the background) vomiting or passing out. Best case scenario, attention is split between mom and the person who went down. Worst case, you get injured, mom gets injured, movement around mom is impaired, and everything just goes sideways.\n\nI absolutely hate that people find it acceptable to mock or \"call out\" people on listening to their bodies and taking appropriate action. She KNEW going in that you were uncomfortable, so she had no reason to believe that you would be able to tolerate HOLDING THE LEG OF A BIRTHING WOMAN throughout her labor. Your body told you you were done. You listened. End of story. There's no shame here- in fact, I find it highly ironic that your sister is so upset that you brought up that she passed stool while giving birth, which is both normal and common, when she is attempting to shame you for NOT allowing yourself to contribute to the drama of the delivery. \n\nOne way you might be able to get your point across is that \"natural\" doesn't mean \"fun\" or \"beautiful\" or \"you have to enjoy it\". Yes, birth is a beautiful thing, but that does NOT mean you have to watch it happen. Decomposition is natural.  Most people you talk to will agree that although it is \"natural\", some natural things are best appreciated from a distance. Birth happens to be one of those things for you.\n\nSo again NTA.

No shame or guilt bc he\u2019s always been clean how squeamish he is. I did in-fact poop told the dr to pls remove it bc I couldn\u2019t push knowing that it was there (mental thing about the baby fall into it) she did and we kept pushing.

She is feeling tender and maybe is letting out that she felt abandoned in the moment. Most people feel embarrassed and ashamed about having a BM in labor.

(You popped out a grape, she popped out a watermelon - it's not the same, I would tell her).", "That's... *unfortunately*, not realistic. At least in this scenario. Asking me to hold my barf until I can secure back-up when hit with a wave of nausea is as ridiculous as me asking my sis to hold her shit while pushing lol for the record, I didn't like, throw her leg onto the bed though. I suddenly became really nauseous and was about to puke, lowered her leg and left the room. A midwife stepped in at that point. A solidly better outcome than barfing on her, I think :/", "I don't know how me having to leave because I was about to vomit is targeting and invalidating her having a human reaction. Unless there's something else I said that makes you think this? I mean, maybe it's my bad for not giving more details, but also that there's a word limit so I was trying to keep things within guidelines lol I don't think it's abnormal to poop giving birth. I think some folks are reading this and assuming I'm just generally triggered by poop and/or had no idea it was a possibility but that's not the case. That was just what set me off during an already intense, messy, smelly moment. Birth is all of those things, it's natural and nothing to be ashamed over seeing as it's how we all got here to begin with.. but barfing is also natural, which I would've done if I hadn't excused myself. So me and sis are in the same boat when it comes to that. Supportive husbands throw up or pass out witnessing birth all the time, it doesn't mean they didn't meet expectations. I was there for her for the entirety of her labor and did all I could to support her emotionally/mentally and physically helping her, I don't think me getting ill nullifies that.\n\nI honestly do appreciate everyone sharing their perspective, because reading through critical messages still help me to see how emotions and peoples embarrassment over this particular issue about childbirth factors into how they perceive not just the comment I made, but like.. the *entirety* of the experience. Me getting sick in that one moment seems to be the deciding factor in whether or not I should've been present at all to some even outside of what I said :/ I get it, it's sensitive and although I **didn't** respond trying to humiliate my sister, the fact that I said it in front of other people *did* make her feel shame. Apparently she didn't even know she pooped which added to it. But she also made *me* feel ashamed over something I could not control which put me on the defense. I'm not some inflammatory and mean-spirited person who would've ever said that unprompted to embarrass her. I wish it didn't happen at all, but having given this a lot of thought and considering the boundaries I want to set, I'm not going to be apologizing for what I said with no ill intent or let our mom guilt me. I haven't spoken to my sister yet, but I laid down the law with our mom and thankfully she's moved along understanding my stance. I'm a non-confrontational person so I'm not gonna fight about this, I know May is tired and super hormonal and she can reach out when she's ready.", "I saw my niece's birth and that was the very moment I finalized my decision to NEVER have children. It was horrifying and I almost blacked out, then had to hear about \"sewing it back up\" and \"being gentle around the stitches\" when she wiped. NO THANK YOU.", "Same reason for everything over here, \"muh family\", if not \"muh tradition\".", "I've given birth. I know how full on it is. Sometimes the partner you choose (or are stuck with) cannot handle the full reality.\n\nShe chose to humiliate her sister instead of having a private word and I wonder if she did anything to vet how her sister would cope with it in the first place. Especially since OP told her sister she couldn't watch the birth videos. Also I dont know why her sister had to be holding her fucking leg. One. women shouldn't birth on their backs anyway and two. why did she need to be at gross end? My husband was my birth partner but I know it should have been my mum (thanks covid) because he's squeamish and has hospital trauma.", "Yeah I\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t normal for you to need to vomit, but with 20/20 hindsight, you could\u2019ve just said that the whole thing made you sick without detailing exactly which part of it made you sick. That would\u2019ve been the kinder way to phrase it. I\u2019m sure they also could\u2019ve been nicer to you about it too.", "Op, your response was normal. You had already told her that you may have to stay above the waist. You did nothing wrong during the birth, and you did nothing wrong during that conversation. I believe you when u said that it just came out trying to defend yourself. I don't sense any meaness or malice coming from you.\n\nI'm sorry you were ganged up on\n It was very unfair to you. I agree that you do not owe your sister an apology. They put you on the spot, not the other way around. \n\nNTA", "You targeted her and invalidated her human reaction of pooping during birth. Just because you felt embarrassed about being called out for having to leave the room and go puke, you disclosed something in public about her birth she didn\u2019t even know herself. You can\u2019t see how that is extremely hurtful, in a time where hormones are in overdrive and she\u2019s probably dead tired and having little to no sleep? You don\u2019t understand why you should apologize? That\u2019s really shitty of you. No pun intended.", "I\u2019ll go into a maternity ward and say fuck you to every baby in there. I\u2019ll double up and go slap the moms in the face too for having such fuck you-able babies.", "Can you just reply to the maturity question? \n\nI don\u2019t know why she was holding her leg, maybe applying counter pressure or maybe she was on her side, im not judging her birthing positions. \n\nE S H is the sane answer. If you can\u2019t watch birth videos then say no. If someone says they can\u2019t watch the birth videos then choose a different partner. If someone calls you out on ducking out when a necessity part of the birth support team then just respond like a human and say it\u2019s full on and you felt nauseous. Zero need to humiliate the woman who gave birth.", "In hindsight, yes, though the best outcome for this would have came if my sister had just spoken to me one on one about feeling upset. I wouldn\u2019t have had to explain myself in a split second and embarrass her in doing so, perhaps in a clumsy way while feeling attacked. I got no joy out of that being what happened and it wasn\u2019t my intention. I can definitely admit I wasn\u2019t thinking about her feelings, that only came after.. I was thinking about mine and having to deal with family members judging me because of my sisters portrayal.", "How? It seems like you've just grabbed onto terms I used and are trying to apply it to your opposing argument. How did I target or invalidate her human reaction? There's nothing I've said here that \"invalidated\" her shitting. Invalidating was her acting like I was childish and inconsiderate to step away when ill, as if my reaction could have been controlled when it could not. I've also not invalidated her emotion to me mentioning it. In my original post I already said that I understand it. I made this post because I realized I spoke out defensively and wanted to ask people outside of my circle if I was an asshole. As it'd turn out the family members who heard this have also assured me they know I had no ill intent and have chalked this up to it being an emotional time.\n\nI just had a conversation with a friend who reminded me of something I often say, which is that intent matters. My intent was **not** to hurt or humiliate her, the words ONLY left my mouth to defend myself when I was being unfairly criticized and set up to be judged by my family. I don't know what May's intent was because I'm not in her head, but I'll admit it feels harder to give her the benefit of the doubt when she waited until she had our family present to air her grievances. If she apologized then I'll accept it, no hard feelings and move on like nothing happened, and I'm sure she probably will because I'm her only sister and free baby sitter once our mom flies back out of state lol\n\nUltimately, we **both** said something that hurt the other that did not need to be said in this context. Her feelings, hormonal or not, aren't more important than mine, nor do I believe mine more important than hers. The reason I am not apologizing is because I know that I did nothing wrong in getting sick momentarily while supporting her for many hours, and I only publicly shared the reason why (which is why she's hurt) because she chose to shame me for an insignificant moment, instead of talking about it privately with ME like a normal person.", "I would totally go for that deal of just being handed a baby, not because childbirth is gross but because then I wouldn't be risking my life to get a baby. Pregnancy and childbirth is dangerous!", "Home birth and midwife birth are not the same thing", "It's on the person giving birth to choose people who can handle the birth. OP told her sister she couldn't because she couldn't watch the videos so sister skipped into birth on wishful thinking because what? Her gaping vagina is more magical than a video of it? Immature.\n\nThen when reality played out as easily predicted OPs sister sat on her feelings about it until she could humiliate her sister rather than accepting any of the responsibility for her own poor decision making. Very immature.\n\nBirthing partners often cop a lot of flack when they are going to be the co-parent and rightly so. You need to get used to gore if you're going to parent, it's mostly body fluids. But to ask a child free by choice person who has told you that they are squeamish to not only be your birth partner but get upset when they're unable to cope especially when they're down the business end? Nah dawg you brought that on yourself.\n\nEta. She also did say why she left, because she felt nauseous and guess what? Saying someone pooped during birth shouldn't be embarrassing or surprising.", "I get it. I also get how it\u2019s super annoying to have your family characterize you as somehow not grown up enough to handle it. As if everyone needs to be totally fine with seeing that. \n\nFor the record, when I gave birth the *last* thing I wanted was someone in the room who wasn\u2019t 100% ok with seeing everything. Like why would I want to force someone to see me like that?", "Yeah pregnancy is a means to an end for many women. Of course there are many different experiences but it\u2019s not required to feel reverent towards childbirth. In fact, childbirth was generally feared until the 20th century due to maternal and baby mortality, and due to the ways it messed up women\u2019s bodies before modern medicine (and I have friends who still have issues from their pregnancy/ births.)", "I still bet it's bullshit what you're claiming. Surely not even taking into account that high risk pregnancies go with doctors.", "No, they both have responsibility here. You can\u2019t possibly argue that someone who enters that room would be expecting not to see anything, so why not just say no? I\u2019m assuming she agreed. Childfree doesn\u2019t mean unable to help birth a child, that\u2019s a stretch.", "Midwives and doulas work alongside doctors in the US", "I'm assuming that she was pressured into it by both her mother and sister. I also wonder how much of the 'childfree' attitude they were hoping to change with this farce. When the childfree and the squeamishness are taken together it's easy to see why OP might not want to see a birth.\n\nI don't agree that it's not the birthing person's full responsibility. But whatever. OP has learned a valuable lesson about her sister hasn't she?", "Been around a butchered  cow?   Ugh. The heave smell of the blood is something I just can\u2019t deal with.", "So you were reading this thread in horrified fascination like watching a train wreck? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Ehh, NTA but you must have known she would've noticed her support running off in the middle of labour, and it probably felt pretty shitty (no pun intended) so I'm gonna say while you haven't done anything wrong, all of this probably would've been avoided if you'd just said to her in a quiet moment after the delivery \"hey, I'm sorry for running out like that, I just was overwhelmed by the whole thing\" or something to that effect.", "ESH, your sister sounds controlling but you also should\u2019ve just put your foot down and said no to her request if you knew you wouldn\u2019t want to be there.", "Literally everybody who has given birth or assisted at a birth knows about the pooping, lol. It happens to literally everyone. Everybody else in the room already knew she pooped during the delivery and she was being a poop to you for ?mom-clout? So you just told everyone how it really was. If the cousin keeps giving you trouble remind her that she pooped too and you\u2019ll tell everyone if she doesn\u2019t shut up.", "Sometimes mums choose or want to push on their back, even at home. Sometimes we start on all-fours or standing up or on their side, but for whatever reason, it doesn\u2019t feel good and they switch to lying on their back. My guess is it has something to do with how baby is coming out.", "\"You knew you couldn't handle seeing a live birth, but still agreed to go through with it\" - I never said this, nor felt it. Finding birth disturbing doesn't mean I cannot handle seeing it. I did handle seeing it, I don't think it makes sense to discount that due to missing like 90 seconds of the labor. You saying I \"stepped out during a crucial part of the birthing process\" makes it sound like I left to take a cigarette break and came back 20 minutes later.. I was about to vomit, left, collected myself and returned by her side within moments, just not holding her leg. Being disappointed by that is as senseless as if I said I was disappointed she shit herself.. neither one of us could control it. Surprise, shitting and barfing are both bodily functions we don't get to tell to fuck off and come back later because the moment isn't right. Didn't change the fact I gave her my full attention and support.\n\nUltimately, although it was not my intent, in defending myself I had to share something that caused her embarrassment. I didn't randomly just share an unsavory tidbit about her birth story, in hopes of humiliating her to retaliate for her making me out to be a bad guy; I was being unfairly portrayed over things I couldn't help, and explained the honest reality of what happened.  If she just came to me privately and didn't blast me in front of family members then neither of us would've been put in an uncomfortable situation.", "Sorry you're so misinformed, but the facts don't agree with you.", "I\u2019ve done more in the hospital yes, but I\u2019ve attended home births as well (as a doula WITH a midwife, not as an RN-that would be practicing midwifery without a license!) I mean, yes, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not an ideal position to birth in, but it is a position that many women just find themselves in.", "hahaha this is totally how I'm going to be", "I just had very quick deliveries. My 3rd delivery that didn't tear me was 2.5 hours from hormone drip anx breaking my waters to holding my baby. \n\nAlso you can do everything \"right\" and things still go wrong", "My daughter's head smelled like whatever she came out like for the first couple hours. I kept sniffing her head because I loved the smell. I wanted to cry when they had my husband give her a bath and wash the smell off.\nMy son was taken to the CICU shortly after birth and I didn't get to hold him until after he was bathed, so I never got that experience with him.", "What I'm talking about is stuff that you start doing around 6 months pregnant. Everyone I've ever talked to who had a bad tear was never provided this info and coaching through pregnancy unfortunately. \n\nBut yes I'm sure there are still situations where nothing could change it.", "I have a uterus and am happy that I will never have to go through this either! High fives all around!", "I\u2019ve had three kids, am done and didn\u2019t really want to be at those three either lol. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ll probably never have to go to another one!
