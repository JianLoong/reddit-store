When the other 2 girls have a play date scheduled, during the school day they brag and advertise their play date to my daughter knowing full well that she is not invited and rubbing it in that she is excluded. My daughter says that she can tell they do this to intentionally hurt her. They also ignore my daughter leading up to and on the day of the play date causing my daughter to become very hurt and anxious and left out. This happens every time they have a play date and my daughter is so upset by this exclusion, she wants to leave the school. \n\nThe mentioned to the mum of one of the girls (who I *thought* was a good friend, she\u2019s a single mum with a complex home life and we help her out A LOT with her kids) that my daughter feels upset when the friends tell her about a play date that she is not invited to. I asked if she could ask her daughter to be discreet about her play dates with the other child and not talk about it in front of my child. \n\nI also said that I don\u2019t expect my daughter to be invited to the play date as everyone is entitled to these things without feeling pressured to invite others. We also arrange play dates 1:1 at other times so the issue is not about not being invited. \n\nI said that if my daughter is not invited to the play date to please ask the girls not to involve my daughter by discussing it or brag about it to my daughter.\n\nWell, this did not go down well. The mother absolutely went off at me and accused me of asking her to lie to a child, and asking her to ask her child to lie to a friend. I was gobsmacked as this is not at all what I asked. \n\nAITA for asking her and her daughter to be discreet around my daughter when they have arranged a play date with another particular child?\n\nEdit: hi everyone, thank you to everyone who responded and offered their advice and own experiences. I really appreciate the support. I\u2019ve been quite upset about this and have been questioning whether I was in the wrong. A lot of people have made some really good suggestions and I wanted to give some more info/detail.\n\n1. My daughter is autistic and has ADHD and learning disorders. She has a really hard time at school already and this mean girl behaviour just makes it that much harder. Social situations are actually the hardest part for her and she really struggles with understanding friendships, what good friendships are, and the not so good ones. She takes people on face value, so if someone is being nice to her they are her friend. If a friend is mean to her, she doesn\u2019t know why and blames herself, or tries to find something wrong with her and why they don\u2019t like her anymore. It\u2019s torment for her. \n\nWe do everything we can to help her understand that these girls aren\u2019t friends if they treat her this way and if she doesn\u2019t feel happy when she is with them, but unfortunately for her, she is so desperate to be included and to have their approval, she gets pulled in and then spat out every time. \n\n2. We are working with a speech therapist and OT to help her understand her neurodivergence, how the world, people, things may seem different for her and how to recognise when she needs to walk away, and how to stand up for herself. It\u2019s very hard for her because she is worried about retaliation from these girls. They also alienate her from the good friendships she does have, those girls we encourage her to seek out when she is having a hard time. These nasty girls are finding ways to drive a wedge between my daughter and these genuine friends. It\u2019s really heartbreaking for us and my daughter.\n\n3. The hardest part of this is she believes she had/has genuinely good friendships with them 1:1. It\u2019s when they get in a group they gang up on her. Actually, she doesn\u2019t even need to be part of the group and they gossip and gang up on her and she find out about it from others.\n\n4. I totally agree with comments Re the mother - she\u2019s dealing with a lot of shit at the moment in her own life but I have realised she\u2019s not a friend. I\u2019m actually really surprised by her reaction because 2 of her kids are autistic and our family have been really empathetic and supportive of her and her kids. To the point where we have had them here at 7am on a school day to take them to school to help with their anxiety about going to school. \n\nI found out today that she reported me to the school for \u201cconfronting her\u201d about this play date thing. I\u2019m totally shocked by this because there was no confrontation at all. I think that I triggered a pressure cooker situation without realising it. My husband stands by me and says my friendship is not worth her bullshit. She\u2019s been using me and it\u2019s not a safe friendship.\n\n5. The mother has been talking shit about me behind my back. She came I to our school a year ago (we\u2019ve been at the school for 3.5yrs) and has been bad mouthing me to our parent group. I\u2019m really hurt by that because these are people who I have built friendships with and she is telling them lies about me that are totally untrue (ie she is telling people I told her to lie etc)\n\n6. We have raised a bullying allegation against these girls and the school is *finally* taking it seriously after trying for 2 years to get them to do something about it. Who knows where it will lead but we are actively looking for another school for our daughter because we feel that the school has done nothing but to enable these girls.\n\n7. We have our daughter enrolled in gymnastics and soccer/football so she does that 3 afternoons a week and then therapy 1 x week. Due to the strain school puts on her, we have to be careful about overloading her after school. She\u2019s already hit her limit before she leaves school because she puts so much energy into managing her feelings around schoolyard nastiness. \n\nThanks everyone - I really needed to hear that I\u2019m not the AH here \ud83d\udc9c", "created_utc": 1686308517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1452695/aita_for_asking_friend_and_her_daughter_to_be/", "score": 626, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's understandable that your daughter feels hurt and excluded when her friends constantly talk about their play dates in front of her.

Hope your kiddo can find better friends", "NTA- Those girls aren't, and never were friends. I would find a way to explain to your daughter that she's done nothing wrong, that they are in the wrong. Though she's going to be hurt, you need to explain that they aren't her friends, and that it is OK to find new ones.

The other two would be thick as thieves, making friendship bracelets and writing letters in secret codes just to make the third girl feel left out, and then being put through the same misery when it was our turn to be the third girl. Don\u2019t let your daughter play the perpetual third girl. She\u2019ll never win.

That\u2019s a perfectly reasonable request. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s dealing with that.", "NTA\n\nPart of growing up is accepting you arent involved in everyones plans or events. Its an important lesson. That said rubbing in other peoples faces that you have plans can be infuriating and it sounds like minor bullying. \n\nAsking the other parent to get their kid to be accommodating is fine but I don't see why you didn't tell your daughter to first of all look to make more friends? Seems like this would be a way to solve the conflict without talking to the other parents. Maybe your daughter will make good friends with other people who don't bully her in the same way. \n\nRealistically the mother has very little control over how her kids act when she isn't around. I think her response is quite extreme and blown out of proportion. You wanted them to have a chat with their child saying \"dont boast about yourself or bask in the emotions of others turmoil.\" (Or words more appropriate for 9 year olds)", "Nta, But stop setting up play dates between your daughter and these girls immediately.

Kids are starting to realize that they sometimes have or do things that other kids don't and that having or doing certain things make them \"special\" - and being special gives them power. It usually starts with toys - \"this is my toy and you have to do xyz for me if you want to play with it\"! But it usually does eventually translate into friendships and cliquey behavior. \n\nHowever, it is the parents' responsibility to do exactly what you are asking - to teach their child kindness. Unfortunately it might be hard for this mother who is struggling to provide a stable home life for her daughter to take away any opportunity for her daughter to feel special or superior. There are probably a lot of things that she can't give her daughter, but she can make her feel special about special playdates. \n\nI don't have much practical advice for you.

I think you told your friend both too much and too little. The issue is one that has a mix of good and bad and I think you have to present the issue very narrowly, and be clear as to what you want done differently.\n\nFirst of all I don't know what you mean by \"be discreet\". It's vague.\n\n\"not to involve my daughter by discussing it\" is far too broad and should not have been voiced.\n\n\"or brag about it to my daughter\" frankly I don't see anything wrong with this behavior at all, and again was far too broad. The friends were happy. They had fun. It's a healthy thing. It's hard for me to see what, specifically, was unreasonable that the girls should learn to do differently. It makes me wonder if perhaps it might not be better if your daughter developed a sincere interest in how her friends' own play dates went.\n\nI don't doubt your daughter is being bullied, but feelings and facts are different. If you could not describe the problem with more precision, then I think you should have involved your friend more with the solution to its effects.", "NAH \n\nI don\u2019t think it was wrong if you to ask, but as parents we have to also teach our kids that they won\u2019t be invited to everything and that is ok.

Maybe they overreacted, but if they calmly said no- I\u2019d understand. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t tell my kid to lie, maybe I\u2019d suggest they be less obvious because at 9- they know better, but I\u2019d also tell them that this kind of ostracizing behavior will catch up to them and have natural consequences further down the line. \n\nEncourage your daughter to play with other kids, find other mom groups and other kids.

The original mean girls drove a wedge between my daughter and the girl in question this year - but it has now blown up to a point where I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any resolution to this. So yes, I am the AH for trying to resolve the issues in the friendship but I now see that my efforts are wasted on these people.", "Btw I'm autistic and I remember struggling with girl politics in elementary/middle.

The mom and the daughter are not your friends. Your daughter is having a hard time understanding this of course.  But I'm confused about why you extended yourself to help the mother so much. The mom is where the daughter learned this behavior.\n\nPlease let them go and help your daughter do the same.", "NTA but I\u2019d be sorting that mom right out. All free help and support finished and report her to the school and her bullying kids", "If possible, i would pull your daughter out of school until you can relocate her.

My mom eventually moved me to another school but the damage had been done and i went from having loads of \"friends\" to pretty much being a loner after 5th grade until end of high school.", "I'm confused by this whole situation. She has two *very good friends*... who bully and taunt your daughter regularly? How are they her good friends? Also, why is there never a playdate with all 3 at the same time?\n\nAnd based on your edit, you've been raising bullying allegations against the girls for TWO YEARS, but still subject her to playdates with them? Why??", "NTA at all. \nI know you are already sorting so this in unnecessary from me but honestly I was so affected by the story. \nI am an autistic woman - I wasn\u2019t diagnosed till I was 30. \nWhen I was a child I went to a VERY small private school, I mean 6 people in my entire class small. Less than 50 in the whole school. \n\n3 boys and 3girls - I was the youngest girl but in a quirk of fate by far the tallest! I was 5ft 6 aged 10. I looked a lot older than the other two girls but in reality I was almost 9months younger and socially younger due to autism and I think just naturally tbh. I was very desperate to be friends with the other two girls and 1 on 1 they could be perfectly nice to me but together they were AWFUL- they would destroy homework and hide bags, exclude me from playing with anyone, pour milk on me, steal my things, were rude horrid nasty little girls who made me so miserable. And how they treated me as children really affects me as an almost 40year old adult which I know sounds pathetic. \nBut I struggled to learn how to make friends, would accept any toxicity just to keep a friend, even now I have so much anxiety over being liked and accepted it can make me feel sick. I go into every situation expecting people to dislike me and that\u2019s not healthy. But it\u2019s somewhat ingrained now. I have mental workarounds. \n\nThe reason I say all this is not to terrify you- if you met me you probably would think I\u2019m a friendly happy woman with a husband, friends , hobbies because I am. But it took some time to get here. \nSo if you can extricate your daughter from the cesspool of those little girls now - do so immediately. \nShe will be happier in the long run I promise you! \n\nI wish you and your daughter nothing but the best", "NTA - I feel for your daughter, I have Adhd and I\u2019m autistic as well and school days were absolute hell because of what you\u2019re describing. Thankfully the really mean girls mostly left me alone, but the times I would get exposed to their dynamics due to the one friend I had who was in that group of friends it was some absolute booty and not fun. I used to beg to skip birthday parties and stuff because of how on the outside I felt and how often I was excluded. I had such conflicting feelings about my friends growing up because they treated me pretty poorly as a group, but one on one was always great. It was the worst in middle school, very isolating experience.\n\nI don\u2019t want to scare you about what your daughter may experience, just tell you that her feelings are understood and so are her experiences. It\u2019s a really hard age, it\u2019s hard to be autistic, it\u2019s hard to have adhd. Every little thing is so exhausting, anxiety and depression are expected, it\u2019s like having a brain that is so amazing, but such a struggle. You are doing the right thing by fighting for her, she deserves an advocate and as her parents y\u2019all are doing a great job. Thank you for offering the support she needs, not all of us get it growing up and I love seeing when parents really do their jobs and step up for their kids.\n\nYou are doing amazing, so NTA in any way. Your friend is struggling, but she is being so unkind to you and your family. You deserve better.", "NTA \nI know this isn\u2019t an advice sub, but as a mom who has had this challenge - our daughter has had a lot of success with processing her feelings and learning how to handle it for herself through several different kids\u2019s book. \n\n\nWe really like the Friends series by Shannon Hale (fiction, graphic novel) and the American Girl Series about friendship (non-fiction, illustrated and anecdotal). These gave out kiddo some great language and some solace knowing that she\u2019s not isolated in her experience.", "NTA. \n\nAs a young adult who has ADHD and is looking into if I\u2019m autistic as well, I wish my mom would have helped me navigate my neurodivergence like you are doing with your daughter. I just want to say I think you\u2019re doing a great job with your daughter. Having adhd is really hard for me and has really strained my friendships throughout the years so I\u2019m glad you\u2019re there to help her.", "NTA.  You were simply suggesting that the mother teach manners to her child.  I knew by the age of 9 that it wasn't cool to brag out going to parties in front of people who weren't invited.", "NTA. I deeply empathise with your daughter, had some similar experiences, albeit a bit older. Can confirm those girls are not her friends, and the sooner she can disconnect from them the better - it really messed up my ability to form friendships. She is lucky that she has such a good relationship with you (ie. She feels able to talk to you, you are on her side and steering her right)", "NTA\n\nIt is basic manners to not sit there chatting about events when someone isn't invited. I'm not saying people should lie or jump through a bunch of hoops to conceal it, but if you have three people at a table you should talk about something *all three of them* can engage with.\n\nThe two friends are junior AHs in the making. It is a parent's job to teach them better.", "My mom always taught me you don't discuss plans in front of people not invited. Like two friends in our friend group have kids close in age, they got really close during the pandmic and have started to hang out without the core group.   They don't hide it, they just don't rub our faces in it, either. nta", "Very NTA, and I'm sorry your daughter is going through this. When my daughter had some mean friends around the same age, I told her that when people we care about hurt us again and again, eventually our hearts learn that they are not safe places to put our trust, and we stop caring what they think of us. We can still appreciate what's good in them, but they lose the power to hurt us. I think telling her that helped her reach the \"actually I really don't want to be friends with them at all\" stage faster. Good luck, sending hugs!", "NTA. Stop helping that mother. And go to the parents group and TELL them her daughter is a bully.", "Gotta love when parents compete over play dates like it's the Olympics. NTA for wanting peace and quiet, OP.", "Esh if they don\u2019t consider your daughter their friend and your daughter continues to try to be around them that\u2019s a form of harassment as well. Just bc she\u2019s autistic doesn\u2019t mean she can force herself into groups and you need to react to that as well. Is it even bullying if it\u2019s trying to live your life away from someone", "NTA for confronting the mom. I also have ADHD and autism. My only concern comes from the edit because I\u2019m confused on the timeline. \n\nYou said you\u2019ve been trying for the school to take bullying allegations seriously for 2 years, but the other mom only came to the school a year ago. I think this is just me misreading something, but either way my concern is: \n\nYour daughter has been desperately trying to find friendship in these girls for 2 years while they bully her to the point that school intervention is necessary.. and was still allowed on playdates with the girls? \n\nI understand children need autonomy but, as someone who also missed social cues and misunderstands, sometimes adult intervention is needed to prevent such hurt. Because she\u2019s been holding onto hope and these \u201cfriendships\u201d for two years it\u2019s going to be so much more crushing than if someone were to just stop the play dates in the first place, especially because it sounds like your daughter does have other friends.", "Three is also a very bad number, especially for a group of girls this age.

The issue is one that has a mix of good and bad and I think you have to present the issue very narrowly, and be clear as to what you want done differently.", "[removed]", "NTA - This is pretty classic behavior for that age.", "There is a serious problem with the \"best friend\" stereotype. You don't *need* to have just one person who is your closest friend ever, who you share everything with, etc... It is perfectly fine to have five people who you are close to, and each relationship can be close in different ways. It doesn't have to be *all* or *nothing*.\n\nI'm not saying it is wrong to be super close with exactly one friend, but it should be personal, not just an attempt to follow a particular narrative of female friendship.", "Oh I can totally confirm three girls is a bad number. \nEspecially if one is a meanie.\n\nI grew up on a street where there were three girls all the same age, myself being one of the three. \nWe went to elementary school and junior high together.\n\nOne of the girls took great pleasure in pitting myself and the third girl against each other\u2026\n\nI learned a lot of hard unpleasant lessons because of her.\n\nMostly about how cruel, dishonest and conniving some people are apparently born to be. \n\nNot a learned behavior.

If you have the means to find her a different school that has a more nurturing culture and smaller classrooms, do it.  In my experience public schools can be really shark-infested waters - too many kids, too few teachers.  I don't know where you live, but I also found a like-minded mother and we started a Girl Scout troop.  That gave us the opportunity to be around the kids and get an idea what was going on.  If you have the time to do that, I found it to be really helpful to my daughter.  Interestingly, the other mother had a neurodivergent child.  \n\nWe ultimately kept our youngest in public school and constantly talked about good friends, etc.  ad nauseum and it did finally get through to her in middle school.

She takes people on face value, so if someone is being nice to her they are her friend.

I was medicated around 7yo and it has made a huge difference in my ability to navigate social situations (when compared to my brother who is very similar to me, but was medicated in 8th grade).

Just like all brain meds, it can take a lot of tweaking, but afterwards your daughter should have a much easier time keeping control of her thoughts and actions (she will also likely be better at introspection and have a good amount of emotional intelligence since the ADHD med process contains a lot of stuff similar to traditional therapy).\n\nI wish you and your daughter all the best, especially as a woman who grew up with pretty severe ADHD and went through the situations you describe. \n\nIf you (or anyone else who stumbles upon this) have any questions regarding medicating for ADHD and what it actually feels like from the child's perspective (I remember it surprisingly well), I am happy to answer anything here or privately.", "Sorry, to clarify, there\u2019s Mean Girl A (ringleader) and Mean Girl B who have been tormenting my daughter for 2.5 years.
