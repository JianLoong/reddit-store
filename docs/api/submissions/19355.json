When the other 2 girls have a play date scheduled, during the school day they brag and advertise their play date to my daughter knowing full well that she is not invited and rubbing it in that she is excluded. My daughter says that she can tell they do this to intentionally hurt her. They also ignore my daughter leading up to and on the day of the play date causing my daughter to become very hurt and anxious and left out. This happens every time they have a play date and my daughter is so upset by this exclusion, she wants to leave the school. \n\nThe mentioned to the mum of one of the girls (who I *thought* was a good friend, she\u2019s a single mum with a complex home life and we help her out A LOT with her kids) that my daughter feels upset when the friends tell her about a play date that she is not invited to. I asked if she could ask her daughter to be discreet about her play dates with the other child and not talk about it in front of my child. \n\nI also said that I don\u2019t expect my daughter to be invited to the play date as everyone is entitled to these things without feeling pressured to invite others. We also arrange play dates 1:1 at other times so the issue is not about not being invited. \n\nI said that if my daughter is not invited to the play date to please ask the girls not to involve my daughter by discussing it or brag about it to my daughter.\n\nWell, this did not go down well. The mother absolutely went off at me and accused me of asking her to lie to a child, and asking her to ask her child to lie to a friend. I was gobsmacked as this is not at all what I asked. \n\nAITA for asking her and her daughter to be discreet around my daughter when they have arranged a play date with another particular child?\n\nEdit: hi everyone, thank you to everyone who responded and offered their advice and own experiences. I really appreciate the support. I\u2019ve been quite upset about this and have been questioning whether I was in the wrong. A lot of people have made some really good suggestions and I wanted to give some more info/detail.\n\n1. My daughter is autistic and has ADHD and learning disorders. She has a really hard time at school already and this mean girl behaviour just makes it that much harder. Social situations are actually the hardest part for her and she really struggles with understanding friendships, what good friendships are, and the not so good ones. She takes people on face value, so if someone is being nice to her they are her friend. If a friend is mean to her, she doesn\u2019t know why and blames herself, or tries to find something wrong with her and why they don\u2019t like her anymore. It\u2019s torment for her. \n\nWe do everything we can to help her understand that these girls aren\u2019t friends if they treat her this way and if she doesn\u2019t feel happy when she is with them, but unfortunately for her, she is so desperate to be included and to have their approval, she gets pulled in and then spat out every time. \n\n2. We are working with a speech therapist and OT to help her understand her neurodivergence, how the world, people, things may seem different for her and how to recognise when she needs to walk away, and how to stand up for herself. It\u2019s very hard for her because she is worried about retaliation from these girls. They also alienate her from the good friendships she does have, those girls we encourage her to seek out when she is having a hard time. These nasty girls are finding ways to drive a wedge between my daughter and these genuine friends. It\u2019s really heartbreaking for us and my daughter.\n\n3. The hardest part of this is she believes she had/has genuinely good friendships with them 1:1. It\u2019s when they get in a group they gang up on her. Actually, she doesn\u2019t even need to be part of the group and they gossip and gang up on her and she find out about it from others.\n\n4. I totally agree with comments Re the mother - she\u2019s dealing with a lot of shit at the moment in her own life but I have realised she\u2019s not a friend. I\u2019m actually really surprised by her reaction because 2 of her kids are autistic and our family have been really empathetic and supportive of her and her kids. To the point where we have had them here at 7am on a school day to take them to school to help with their anxiety about going to school. \n\nI found out today that she reported me to the school for \u201cconfronting her\u201d about this play date thing. I\u2019m totally shocked by this because there was no confrontation at all. I think that I triggered a pressure cooker situation without realising it. My husband stands by me and says my friendship is not worth her bullshit. She\u2019s been using me and it\u2019s not a safe friendship.\n\n5. The mother has been talking shit about me behind my back. She came I to our school a year ago (we\u2019ve been at the school for 3.5yrs) and has been bad mouthing me to our parent group. I\u2019m really hurt by that because these are people who I have built friendships with and she is telling them lies about me that are totally untrue (ie she is telling people I told her to lie etc)\n\n6. We have raised a bullying allegation against these girls and the school is *finally* taking it seriously after trying for 2 years to get them to do something about it. Who knows where it will lead but we are actively looking for another school for our daughter because we feel that the school has done nothing but to enable these girls.\n\nThanks everyone - I really needed to hear that I\u2019m not the AH here \ud83d\udc9c", "created_utc": 1686308517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1452695/aita_for_asking_friend_and_her_daughter_to_be/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter doesn\u2019t have 2 very good friends. She had 2 people at school that intentionally make her feel bad. Encourage her to find new friends.", "NTA - they're not her friends, they're bullying her. Maybe your daughter should find better friends who won't make her feel miserable all the time.\n\nAnd I think you should stop helping the mother if she's ok with her kid bullying a friend, because at the end of the day, your kid have to come first. Single mom can find help somewhere else.", "NTA - Not the Asshole\r  \n\r  \nIn this situation, you're not asking for anything unreasonable. It's understandable that your daughter feels hurt and excluded when her friends constantly talk about their play dates in front of her. By asking the mother to be discreet or not discuss the play dates in front of your daughter, you're simply trying to protect her feelings and prevent her from feeling left out.\r  \n\r  \nYou made it clear that you don't expect your daughter to be invited to every play date, and you even arrange separate play dates for her. You're not asking for any special treatment or for the other child to lie, but rather for some consideration and sensitivity toward your daughter's feelings.\r  \n\r  \nThe mother's extreme reaction and accusation of asking her to lie seem disproportionate to your reasonable request. It's important to communicate openly and find a solution that respects everyone's emotions and avoids unnecessary hurt.", "NTA but please maybe consider helping your your daughter find some new friends these little girls just sound like little bullies", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, but these are not good friends. There\u2019s lying and then there\u2019s *not bullying*. Obviously the girl\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t see a distinction between the two.", "Nope.\n\nYour daughter needs better friends.\n\nAnd whoever this lady is, needs to get her own shit together, because you \"helping\" ain't working.\n\nDrop that like a bad habit. Move on.", "NTA but  hear me out, the answer is not to ask other people to stop talking about their play dates. It\u2019s clear that those girls are not your daughters friends. You need to teach your daughter that when people act toxic you cut them out. Roll her eyes and say she never wanted to be apart of their play date anyways. Find new friends before trying to go to a whole new school.", "NTA those girls aren't actually her friend. My poor baby sister had a group of friends like that and when they got to middle school she came home crying nearly every day.", "NTA. These don't seem like good friends. They're old enough to know not to brag in front of your kid. If anything they should be asking to include your daughter if they were good friends.

The other girls are being mean. It sounds like they're talking about it intentionally to get under her skin. That's just cruel. Nobody likes being purposefully left out. Hope your kiddo can find better friends", "NTA- Those girls aren't, and never were friends. I would find a way to explain to your daughter that she's done nothing wrong, that they are in the wrong. Though she's going to be hurt, you need to explain that they aren't her friends, and that it is OK to find new ones. Tell her to just start ignoring the girl's, because she is better than them.\n\nMy petty side would come out, though. I would stop helping that mother out altogether.", "NTA. It sounds like your daughter\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d and not very compatible with her, and the parents aren\u2019t very compatible with you.

The other two would be thick as thieves, making friendship bracelets and writing letters in secret codes just to make the third girl feel left out, and then being put through the same misery when it was our turn to be the third girl. Don\u2019t let your daughter play the perpetual third girl. She\u2019ll never win. If the other mom is doing nothing to recognize or help with the fact there\u2019s a problem, even when you put it so kindly, then she\u2019s content to let your daughter go on being mistreated. \n\nNTA", "NTA  \n\n\nBut maybe your daughter should learn a lesson about what real friendship is. I know they are just kids, but she shouldn't think it's a normal for friends to exclude and make fun of each other.", "NTA you are just asking the girls to not be mean to your daughter at school, ultimately. That\u2019s a perfectly reasonable request. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s dealing with that.", "NTA\n\nPart of growing up is accepting you arent involved in everyones plans or events. Its an important lesson. That said rubbing in other peoples faces that you have plans can be infuriating and it sounds like minor bullying. \n\nAsking the other parent to get their kid to be accommodating is fine but I don't see why you didn't tell your daughter to first of all look to make more friends? Seems like this would be a way to solve the conflict without talking to the other parents. Maybe your daughter will make good friends with other people who don't bully her in the same way. \n\nRealistically the mother has very little control over how her kids act when she isn't around. I think her response is quite extreme and blown out of proportion. You wanted them to have a chat with their child saying \"dont boast about yourself or bask in the emotions of others turmoil.\" (Or words more appropriate for 9 year olds)", "Nta, But stop setting up play dates between your daughter and these girls immediately. Not only are these girls not actually your daughter's friends, but their parents have shown that they're not your friends and they don't care.", "NTA: they were never friends to begin with, Op have a Talk with your sister that she done nothing wrong and it\u2019s going to be okay because she is going to find real friends", "NTA - This is pretty classic behavior for that age. Kids are starting to realize that they sometimes have or do things that other kids don't and that having or doing certain things make them \"special\" - and being special gives them power. It usually starts with toys - \"this is my toy and you have to do xyz for me if you want to play with it\"! But it usually does eventually translate into friendships and cliquey behavior. \n\nHowever, it is the parents' responsibility to do exactly what you are asking - to teach their child kindness. Unfortunately it might be hard for this mother who is struggling to provide a stable home life for her daughter to take away any opportunity for her daughter to feel special or superior. There are probably a lot of things that she can't give her daughter, but she can make her feel special about special playdates. \n\nI don't have much practical advice for you. But trying to help your daughter expand her circle of friends would probably help. As would helping her develop hobbies that she can do on her own outside of school that she is excited about so that she has something to look forward to doing after school on days she doesn't have a play date scheduled.", "NTA - obvious trash is obvious", "I think you should encourage your daughter to join \u2018out of school\u2019 clubs/hobbies, and help her to make new friends. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you should cut her off from her friend group, but new friends will help her to see how unnecessary the current girl group dynamic is and give her the option to make her own choices.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but maybe she doesn't know what the word \"discreet\"means?", "NTA, stop helping her. her problems are hers to solve, especially if she won't do the bare minimum to help you and your daughter.", "Your daughter does not have two good friends, she has two bullies.

These girls are being \"mean girls\". I would suggest you help your daughter see the difference and encourage her to drop them and try to help her establish new friendships with other kids.

I think you told your friend both too much and too little. The issue is one that has a mix of good and bad and I think you have to present the issue very narrowly, and be clear as to what you want done differently.\n\nFirst of all I don't know what you mean by \"be discreet\". It's vague.\n\n\"not to involve my daughter by discussing it\" is far too broad and should not have been voiced.\n\n\"or brag about it to my daughter\" frankly I don't see anything wrong with this behavior at all, and again was far too broad. The friends were happy. They had fun. It's a healthy thing. It's hard for me to see what, specifically, was unreasonable that the girls should learn to do differently. It makes me wonder if perhaps it might not be better if your daughter developed a sincere interest in how her friends' own play dates went.\n\nI don't doubt your daughter is being bullied, but feelings and facts are different. If you could not describe the problem with more precision, then I think you should have involved your friend more with the solution to its effects.", "NAH \n\nI don\u2019t think it was wrong if you to ask, but as parents we have to also teach our kids that they won\u2019t be invited to everything and that is ok. And that it is ok to be upset by this. \n\nI don\u2019t think they\u2019re wrong for their not wanting to, either. Maybe they overreacted, but if they calmly said no- I\u2019d understand. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t tell my kid to lie, maybe I\u2019d suggest they be less obvious because at 9- they know better, but I\u2019d also tell them that this kind of ostracizing behavior will catch up to them and have natural consequences further down the line. \n\nEncourage your daughter to play with other kids, find other mom groups and other kids.
