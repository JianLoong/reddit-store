When our relationship is good it's really good! \n\nAnyways, it's just under a year to the wedding and I have started planning my dress and the bridal parties outfits. \n\nMy mum(MOB) also said she wanted to start planning hers. She started showing me full length white dresses. I explained to her that I did not want any resemblance of white for outfits for anyone going to the wedding. \n\nShe went ahead and ordered all white long dresses and has fallen in love with the colour. I told her she would look beautiful but for my wedding day I want to be the only one. \n\nShe had turned the victim and has now said my wedding will look horrendous for her not being allowed to wear white. She has accused me of me not wanting her to feel beautiful and that the day always has to be about me. \n\nWhat do I do?\n\nEDIT- I am in my early 20's. I have only reconnected my relationship with my father over the last year(After 10 ish years).

Please confirm that you won't be wearing a white dress.\". Do not engage with her in any other way. Don't argue or bargain or try to present reason because she won't listen. Don't address any comments she makes.  \n\n\nEventually she'll either be forced to say \"fine I'm not coming\" or \"fine I won't wear a white dress\". I know this because I've just gone through this exact thing myself a few months ago with my FMIL. Good luck!", "NTA, if she thinks she only feels beautiful in that dress, why doesn't she wear it all the time? Set up someone that has your back to watch for her arrival at the wedding and have them turn her away if she shows in the dress.", "Tell her she is uninvited. And that the staff will not allow her in if she is wearing white. \n\nSee what's more important to her. A dress or you.", "NTA. If your committed to wearing white yourself, uninvite her. If you\u2019re open to wearing another color, fight fire with fire and organize all your guests to wear white while you wear royal purple or something?", "NTA - have security in place with standing orders to bar anyone other than the bride wearing white.  Let her know this in advance so the choice to miss the wedding is clearly known in advance and she must make it with malice aforethought.", "NTA: She acts like a child... not even child. Completly detaced from reality.\n\nThat is like the biggest dresscode rule there is. No one wears white at a wedding (in cultures where white is the color).\n\nTell her to change ot not come at all. It doesn't sound like you guys have that great of a relationship.", "NTA. Uninvite her. Tell her you are no longer going to give into her playing the victim.

It's not about her feeling beautiful, it's about you.

She is trying to detract attention from you at your own wedding.\n\nThe good part is that it sounds as though she is willing to comply with your direction that she not wear a white dress. Can you rely on that? Seems questionable.\n\nDoes she have a husband, partner, sister, or close friend that you can enlist for support? And I mean literally get someone to pack a different dress for her so that she can be prevented from wearing the white dress if she backs out on the agreement.\n\nAnother possibility, of course, is just to keep her away from the wedding, but that' a bit extreme.", "You have a few options:\n\n1. Prevent her coming to the wedding if she insists on wearing white\n2. Have a bridesmaid with a well-placed glass of red wine \"trip\" near her while everyone's getting dressed\n3. Let it go\n4. Wear [\"blush\"](https://www.theknot.com/content/blush-pink-wedding-dresses)\n\nYour mother is a narcissist. You've gotten used to dealing with it. But getting a dress nearly a year in advance, and informing you it WILL be white is nasty, narcissist behavior.\n\nEverybody knows just what your mom is, right? When she shows up in white, they will roll their eyes and be internally disgusted by her shenanigans, especially when she plays the victim (which she will, telling you that everyone is criticizing her, and detracting from your day).\n\nDon't give her the attention she craves. Let her do what she will do. Then tell the photographer that you'd like her dress to be colored yellow/pink/blue/whatever when she edits the photographs (and don't tell your mom - let her have 1 photo in her white dress if she insists).\n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with her.

Since Mom's a bit confused these days, I thought I'd take this opportunity to remind everyone attending that you can wear any color you like except white, cream or ivory.

You know some people have different kind of problems, and those people could be our parents. If you can help her, then good. If you exhaust yourself, then you need to take care of yourself.

On the plus side, if she does show up in white, most people will think she looks ridiculous and mock her behind her back forever.  That may be some consolation.  One of my aunts showed up to her son\u2019s wedding, not only in white, but her literal wedding dress.  We all still talk about it, not in a good way, and it has been over 20 years.  And yes, her sisters tried to reason with her, but she doubled down.  I love her but she is a pretty entitled person who thinks if she wants to do something then she is entitled to do it.

Maybe offer to go dress shopping with her where you guys can find a dress you both love and she feels beautiful in. Explain to her also it may be embarrassing for her to show up to your wedding in a white dress as everyone would be talking about it as it is a commonly known \u201cno no\u201d and you don\u2019t want any drama or anything to be taken from your day. Let her know you love her and the last thing you want is something like this get in between is going to be such a special day to share together but your feelings are firm on the topic and you hope she understands your position.\n\nI know a lot of these comments are saying uninvite her etc. and I understand the thought and direction but this is your mom and I know you love her. She sounds like she has some narcissistic traits so pointing out the embarrassment it may cause her may detere her from wanting to wear it. Does she have someone whose opinion she really values?

If she likes white so much I\u2019m sure a pale blue will probably look really nice, and if you want to maybe grease the wheels, offer to let her wear a white shawl over her shoulders at the reception after the ceremony, where it\u2019ll be less of an obvious distraction, since people will be mingling and such by then. Load her up with some silver (faux silver) jewelry and sapphire (faux sapphire) gems (or aquamarine, I\u2019m partial to them as they\u2019re my birthstone), and you\u2019ll have a mother still decked out in pretty much the closest non-white colour to white, with a few concessions like the shawl to hopefully win her over.", "NTA.

Let Everyone wear white. Buy all white bridesmaids and groomsman outfits, call the guests and ask them all to wear white if they can....and you and the groom pick a non-traditional color for only the two of you. I saw a picture of this recently and it was gorgeous. \n\nDo not tell your mother about this or share anything with her from now on. That is, no going to wedding dress or bridesmaid fittings. Cut her off from knowing anything about the wedding at all. Invite only, no sharing of the arrangements. She wants to be a deliberate AH, then she can be.
