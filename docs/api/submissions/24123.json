We are going to live in a basement apartment, while my grandparents live on the first floor.   \nOur decision to move in has not been met with support from my uncle and his wife, who lived in the basement apartment until cca. 5 years ago when they moved to their own newly built house. My grandparents offered my uncle to stay and make a home for his family in the same house however, he ultimately decided to move out and build a new house elsewhere. He admittedly regrets this decision very much.  \nNow, after 5 years, I am moving in to save money from not paying rent to be hopefully someday able to buy my own home. I am not claiming ownership of the house in any way (it belongs to my grandparents) and my grandparents are very happy about my decision because they won't be alone in the big house.  \nMy uncle is still paying for the\u00a0 TVs and the internet in the house, which he mention when I first told him about my decision. Now that I am moving in, I saw no reason for him to keep paying, so I offered to pay instead of him (also for my grandparents TV and internet, as a way of thanking them, as I do not need to pay rent). \n\nI suggested he transfers the TV and internet package to my name which he declined. He wants to keep the packacge to his name and send me the bills to pay for him instead. His reasoning is that he still wants to use the function to watch TV from a computer (he has a TV package in his new house but apparently it does not provide that function). He also just extended the contract with the TV provider (without my knowledge) so he can't (and doesn't want to) cancel it. I would have agreed to this option as a way of having a shared account, but he didn't want to share the password for his user profile, stating that there is no reason for me to have it. Note that he doesn't even live in the house anymore but still visits often to park the car because the house is in a very central location.  \nHe has been very hostile about the whole \"me moving in\" situation and at this point I do not want to have anything to do with him and pay my internet bills through him. I would want to have my own contract written to my name. We had a fight about it and now my whole family is mad at me.

DO NOT give him the password.  Ever.  Keep your account to just you and your grandparents.\n\nOr, let him keep paying for your grandparents and just call to get a separate account set up for the basement apartment.  \n\nEither way, do not start giving your uncle money.  It's super sketchy that he's trying to demand you do things this way.  My guess would be that he's watching _certain things_ on his computer that he doesn't want his wife and kids finding out about and knows his parents don't look at the bill or account/watch history.\n\nBtw, he's also lying.  All streaming services can be watched via computer.  Most don't even have an extra fee unless you want to watch on multiple devices at once.  So there is no way that he can't watch something via his own account that he has access to via your grandparents account.  At most there might be a minimal added cost to add a service onto his home account, but that would still be less than paying for a full package for your grandparents.  So again...he's doing something sketchy.", "NTA - It seems scammy to me but I am not sure how.  Like he pays the property taxes plus has utilities in his name and can come back later and try to claim ownership (depends on state laws/etc and is farfetched but it's just weird).  Or he needs proof of residency at that address for something.", "NTA. FYI - if he no longer lives in the home, the cable company should be willing to cancel the contract, especially if he has moved a minimum distance away. He can\u2019t.. block you from calling the cable company and doing that.", "NTA. Kindly rescind your offer to pay and embrace the wonderful hospitality that he is offering to all members of that house.\n\nWhenever he comes back about you freeloading, remind him that you need offered a solution and HE refused.", "NTA\n\nStop fighting. You tried to reason with him, and now you have no other choices.\n\nGo look up tenant contracts online and print one out for your grandparents to sign. Go in person to your internet/cable store and explain that a non tenant still has a contract with them at that address, but you want your own contract, as you are the new tenant. Present the contract, any mail you get there, any evidence of other utilities if you are getting any bills. Even a cell phone bill mailed to your new address would help. Supply them with uncles address if you have it.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHis is easy: REFUSE to pay, but say you will take over paying as soon as the bills are transfered AND you have your own account. As long as uncle is using them, HE needs to pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n OR: Stop discussing it, go for your own contracts - disconnect his - and let him keep his as long as he is willing to pay for them. No impact on you, you can just make new contracts for YOUR internet and YOUR TV, and ignore his.", "Talk to your grandparents first, and if they agree w/you to switch, talk to the provider.", "\"I'm not comfortable doing that. I can either get my own account in addition to yours, or you can transfer your account to me. Thank you!\"\n\nRinse and repeat as needed.", "Uncle is using the internet and cable services in his name as a proof of continued residency. Since you are not paying any rent to your grandparents or other utilities you have no documentary proof of residency.  \n\nPlease get the services at least to the basement apartment in your name. You could also offer to pay for the water and electricity either completely or at least for the basement apartment. \n\nDo not listen to the flying monkey circus. Just stick to your guns. Since you live there and Uncle doesn't, what he wishes for doesn't matter.
