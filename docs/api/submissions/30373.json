Her fianc\u00e9e has a large family and she's getting a lot of pressure from his mom to invite a tonne of people. She's going for a more expensive venue with a smaller guest list. \n\nAs a result, she isn't inviting a lot of people's partners, including the best man's (groom's *twin* brother) boyfriend, and my (MoH) partner with whom I cohabitate. \n\nInitially, I was told I would get a +1 to invite my best friend and old college roommate who lives overseas in the UK (she spent Christmas with us while she couldn't travel due to COVID and her parents being healthcare workers, so she's close with the family). Since I moved in with my partner and my friend moved back to England, though, my +1 has been rescinded and he has not been invited. Since people have RSVPed 'no', I thought he might end up invited, but he hasn't been. She's met him many times and even stayed in our home with us.\n\nMy mom (totally without my knowledge) even offered to pay for my partner to be at the wedding, because my parents wanted him there. After this, my sister got in touch saying he couldn't come at all. She cited expense (even though mom said she'd help with it), it being a 'slippery slope', and not wanting me to spend the whole day with him so I could focus on her as reasons. \n\nShe stated that if she invited my partner, she'd have to invite the best man's partner. I told her, in that case, I understand the best man's frustration with his other half not being there. I told her that this choice is just going to result in people being upset and she might just have to stomach that.\n\nShe keeps saying she's scared I'm going to hate her and that I'm adding to the people making her feel bad about her choices, despite the fact that she brought it up. She stated that she thinks everyone is turning against her and she seems to want me to take her side and be ok with it, but I kind of just can't? I genuinely think she's wrong to not invite long-term partners of immediate family. She keeps asking me if I'm going to hate her forever and I say no, I disagree but I'm not some grudge-bearing kid, but she won't let it go. It's like she wants me to tell her I agree with her decision. \n\nMy partner is my best friend in the whole world, we have a dog and a whole life together. If anyone else did this, I just wouldn't go to the wedding. But it's my sister and I'm the MoH, so I'm going to have to go, but I'm kind of mad at her.\n\nI don't want to go on about it or bring it up again, I just won't take her side here. She's making me feel really bad, like I'm victimising her by being upset or something? Am I making it about me? Should I just drop it and support her choice?\n\nTL;DR: my sister hasn't invited s/os in immediate family to her wedding (including my and the best man's partners) and she seems to want me to take her side (I'm MOH). I'm worried I'm making it about me, but I think her priorities are out of whack and I'm not going to lie and tell her she's in the right.", "created_utc": 1699183141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17o9rd3/aita_for_not_taking_my_sisters_side_about_her/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Personally I wouldn\u2019t go to any wedding my wife wasn\u2019t welcome at - I\u2019d go alone if it were inconvenient for her to go or something, but not if she was unwelcome. It makes it worse in this instance that it\u2019s clearly not about cost or numbers. You\u2019re most definitely under no obligation to tell her you think her decisions are good, especially because she\u2019s resorting to emotional blackmail to get you to say you agree. \n\nYour sister seems to be having a \u201cleopards ate my face\u201d moment - she seems to have planned under a \u201cyou don\u2019t owe anyone anything\u201d philosophy and is shocked that people are deciding they don\u2019t owe her attendance at her wedding, or sugar-coating their disagreement, etc.", "I want to say NAH, except perhaps for your sister, just a little bit.

That's your right, and she can't make you be on her side.", "NTA. Your sister has made some decisions about her wedding -- that's her right. It's not her right to have everyone agree with her  She not only wants to exclude long-term Partners but she wants people to be happy about it. She gets to make her own decisions but she doesn't get. to fault other people for having their own feelings about it. She acts like this is a surprise to her, that the maid of honor and best man would expect to have their long-term ( in fact to live in) Partners at the wedding. Just how tiny of a wedding is she planning that the maid of honor and best man's Partners don't make the cut?", "NTA.  The bride and groom are within their rights to invite who they want, but you don't have to agree with it.  IMO the wedding party should always have a plus one if they have a partner, especially when they live together though!", "NTA:  I think you portrayed the situation and your stance fairly.

Im sorry this may trigger some people but this whole situation sounds messed up.  1.  You have every right to disagree with your sister and have all your feelings about it.  2.  You are still moh and fulfilling that position.  3.  You are attending the wedding though it probably feels a bit bitter.  4. Yes its your sisters wedding so she can determine the rules and you have graciously decided to overlook the snub and participate.  5.  I cant imagine leaving out grooms twin and bestman\u2019s partner let alone my sisters partner.  6.  Mom offered to pay for your partner and she refused (whats up with that?)\n\nI don\u2019t know what has happened to the concept of marriage ceremonies but what happened to weddings being an event about love and commitment and sharing it with those who are important and their important others.  It doesn\u2019t have to be a massive event but it needs to be something that celebrates. Your sister has every right in the world to plan and create the dream she envisions.  She does not have the right to tell you how to think or feel or push you to agree to something that doesn\u2019t feel right to you.  You have every right to feel angry as long as you\u2019re not bullying her about it, and i don\u2019t think you are or hope not.   \n\nThere is one thing that really is concerning \u2026.  You said she stated that if she invites your partner then she\u2019ll have to invite the best man\u2019s partner aka her grooms twin\u2026. There is something really off there.  What happened?   Something has happened between them. Do they not like one another?  Has she or he done something that set the other one off or made them dislike one another?  This is a part of the mystery.  \n\nAlso you said she said\u2026 if your partner is there you wont be focusing on her.  Somethings off. You know your sister. Is she that shallow that she\u2019d not invite partners so focus could be on her or has she decided in a wiry web of weirdness that not inviting partners would be the beat deception to not have best man\u2019s aka groom\u2019s twin at the wedding.   \n\nHave a heart to heart with your sister and give her your unconditional love and support until you find out whats really going on.

You're way nicer than I am, I definitely would give it a miss just because of all the unnecessary drama", "NTA. \n\nWhat if the tables were turned? What if your boyfriend proposed to you tomorrow and you started to plan a wedding and invited your sister as MOH but told her , her fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t included. How would she feel?", "NAH. Is your sister and fianc\u00e9e inviting plus ones from his side? If not, then it is what it is. This is how she wants her day and it is their wedding so they can decide this. If they are allowing plus ones or the guest list is heavily waited from her fianc\u00e9es side, then I think your sister needs to reassess who is attending. That said, still their wedding, their choice.", "[deleted]", "I don\u2019t know", "Yta her wedding her choice. You are an ass for making her feel bad. Weddings are stressful enough.  Now you are adding more stress by being such an insecure jerk.  Why are so many people afraid to attend weddings solo? Just immature and selfish.", "YTA.\n\nGrow up and attend a family event on your own. Spend time reconnecting with relatives. \n\nLeave the poor bride alone. This kind of added stress hard to forgive.", "As a current MOH, YTA. And here\u2019s why: \n\nYou may not agree with your sister\u2019s decision to not invite your partner. But regardless of who brought it up, you should really be helping to reassure her and do your best to help make sure the wedding is what she envisioned. If you can\u2019t openly agree with her decisions, you definitely don\u2019t need to openly tell her you disagree. And you certainly shouldn\u2019t be piling on when others are being disparaging about her choices. Weddings are stressful enough. \n\nMy partner is currently not invited to my best friend\u2019s wedding and that is fine with me. It\u2019s not because the bride doesn\u2019t like her. In fact, both the bride and the groom LOVE her. But they do not like a bridesmaid bf (for solid reason) and would much rather eliminate any argument she might have for bringing him in order to create less drama. And as the MOH, not only do I support it, but I am openly volunteering to help with that discussion if needed. \n\nYou need to stop thinking about just you and start maybe trying to help your sister navigate the best way forward to have the wedding that she wants.", "NTA for not taking your sisters side. But Y T A for still going to the wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is easy: Since the bride has revoked your partners invitation, drop out as a MOH. and dont go to the wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But it's my sister and I'm the MoH, so I'm going to have to go, but I'm kind of mad at her.\" .. So **you are an AH to your partner, and allow your family to disrespect him. You are a shitty partner, and fail your SO. He can do better.**", "YTA. Sorry, but it is her wedding and her decisson. And you say yourself she is under a lot of pressure to invite more people. So I think, she made a decission and want to stick to it. Because if she change one thing, all of them want to change things. You can ask her, if she would be willing to have some kind of waiting list - if people can't make it but the dinner is already payed, that people of the waiting list (partners from you and the best man for example) can fill in. But if she says no, accept it.  You are her maid of honor and even if you don't think it is fair, she needs you to hold her back free and not add more drama to what is already alot of pressure from family and friends", "YTA\n\nShe told you her vision. You don\u2019t have to agree. \n\nYou can choose to not attend this wedding. Or \u2026 You can go to support your sister on her wedding day without your partner. You cannot dictate how your sister\u2019s wedding day will work best for you. \n\nContinuing to talk about it serves no purpose. Your sister is not asking for your opinion or advice.

Both of your feelings are valid and she shouldn\u2019t expect you to lie to her face and say everything is wonderful.", "Based on this information it appears it is a numbers problem. Could be based on venue size or budget. \n\nIt appears the numbers got out of control because of fianc\u00e9\u2019s large family & pressure from MIL. Your sister\u2019s solution (which is not a bad solution) to stop the chaos & control her budget was to host an intimate event with a limited amount of people. Once she changes her vision to accommodate other people it\u2019s no longer her wedding plan. To allow one person, you have to allow another, then another, then another\u2026 \n\nInstead of arguing your position, ask her what exactly is her vision. This is really not about you or your partner. No one should ever feel badly about attending a wedding alone. Especially if they are in the wedding party. It\u2019s not personal \u2026 it\u2019s just an event that\u2019s about the vision of 2 people. It\u2019s a celebration for those people. Everyone gets the choice of whether or not they want to celebrate with them.", "Weddings are not about other people\u2019s romantic relationships. Just like weddings are not about other people\u2019s children. Just like weddings are not about other people\u2019s lives. No one is forced to attend a wedding.\n\nPeople can have whatever vision they want to have. Couples can choose to get married without anyone there. Get married by Elvis surrounded by strangers. Underwater surrounded by dolphins.", "I love this \u201cthe more, the merrier\u201d mindset. Anytime I\u2019ve ever hosted, I\u2019ve always made it clear that all are welcome for any holiday. I truly don\u2019t care how last minute it is, we will make space and share all we have. I\u2019ve been made to feel welcome at so many events where I knew no one. I just don\u2019t like what this selfish me me me culture has produced. People becoming so stressed out over a few hours on one single day of their life. Googling how many hours does the average person live: 700,800 hours. Perspective people.", "Oh fuck me. The IG photos. How dare I not take that into consideration.", "I\u2019ve seen some incredible instagram photos from Indian weddings. So many people celebrating. The colors are incredible and everyone is having a great time. That\u2019s how you do a wedding.", "You sound like a sullen teenager. Do you go to my kid's high school or smthg?", "Given the cancellations, she clearly can afford to. Also, she should\u2019ve planned better and not invited people whose long-term partners she couldn\u2019t afford to invite in the first place.", "Like other than OP\u2019s mother who\u2019s offering to pay for 1 person\u2026 I have yet to hear anything about anybody pitching in any money to afford these additional people. \n\nIf sister decided to just have a small court house ceremony with a few witnesses because they can\u2019t afford it, would we be giving her a hard time??", "I get that it is easier less stressful to do it that way", "Then she can gives the grooms mum her 10k back and finance it herself.", "Idk, marriage or something probably?", "I can understand how you feel that way. I do, however, know my relationship well enough to politely disagree.", "Yeah you're right. I think I'm just nervous it'll be a huge problem, but I do owe her that much.", "Oh totally. Hence why I said I haven't brought it up. She is the one bringing it up trying to say I hate her now. All I'm saying is that I won't back her up when other people complain. I think she could have gone about it better, but I'm not going to argue for him coming because then I would absolutely be an asshole.", "How dare people care more about their loved ones' feelings than their social media presence and status?", "Fianc\u00e9e's mother has offered to pay for any extras and has already chipped in \u00a310k but an uncle pulled out after his family wasn't invited and then a few more people declined after that. It's in pursuit of a small wedding. That's the bit I don't support, aesthetic over family.", "And sister is right, giving in for one paid demand would cascade into a whole slew of extra unpaid demands. She can't win here.", "Then everyone will be lets pay for x person and then family would be more upset cause partners or friends are invited instead of them. I feel bad for the bride", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she accepted the 10k\u2026 it sounds like it was offered.", "Does she have an issues with the best man\u2019s partner? (And if so, is it because it\u2019s a same sex partnership). I think your sister is not being honest as to what the issue is with inviting your partner, given it\u2019s not money, and other people have RSVPed no, so there are presumably now spaces. Her math ain\u2019t mathing, and it bring her wedding is not actually a valid reason for her to disrespect other people relationships. \nIf she\u2019s vain* to her MIL at the expense of her own family, that\u2019s her decision but she doesn\u2019t get to demand the people being casually disregarded tell her they are ok with her choices. \n\nI\u2019d also ask her how she will feel if it was her soon to be husband not being invited to events you plan, because you decided other people were more important than her partner. If she\u2019s not ok with the shoe being in the other foot, she can get off her high horse. \n\nYou can also tell her you will go to the ceremony and stay for photos but then you are going home to your partner and not stay for the reception. You are helping her cut costs!", "There\u2019s plenty of time before this wedding. If your sister is getting a lot of pushback from other people perhaps you should encourage her to sit down with fianc\u00e9, you & rest of wedding party to all get on the same page.\n\nPlanning a wedding it pretty stressful. It\u2019s always helpful to, at the very least, have the people who have agreed to support the couple on that day be on the same side with them.", "You need to include this in your post. The grooms mother is helping to finance this wedding.", "Oh no I mean I totally understood when it was a numbers and money thing. It got to me when she had people decline and still couldn't make the space for him. \n\nI get that she's in a difficult position, but I'm still upset about the outcome.", "And even if they are paying\u2026 she should not have to invite everyone just because the groom\u2019s mother knows people. \n\nI see why she just cut out the entire +1 thing. The family on both sides sounds just over the top.", "This whole thing sounds like a shit show tbh.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/eKTe1KZwJX\n\nShe's \"chipped in\" 10k", "Which is fine, really. You wanting your SO here is understandable, but she is in a lose-lose situation no matter what she does, and probably regrets the whole wedding ten times over...", "Listen\u2026 I get it. I truly do. I totally understand why you are upset. \n\nBut you have not listed a single person who has supported your sister or come to her aid to help her navigate all these demands. And yes, having money will help. \n\nBut I truly think your sister keeps \u201craising the issue\u201d because she feels alone. And people *are* upset with her. As the MOH and her sister, could you at least *try* to have her back with this. You don\u2019t have to agree but like\u2026 give her a break lol", "Yeah, she talked about wanting to elope. Which is why I wasn't planning on saying anything until she brought it up. My partner and I have been talking about marriage lately and decided we're going courthouse and backyard party because of all of it.", "I have! I wasn't going to say anything until she did. I'm not telling her she sucks I'm just also not supporting it aloud. \n\nI've planned and paid for her bachelorette, I'm hand-painting her wedding favours, I'm helping her a lot.", "To me that sounds more fun, to be honest. And you can avoid all the \"why does x person get a plus one when aunt Becky isn't invited\" drama.\n\nCan't you guys just compromise? Like giving your partner a role? At least she could say that your partner is invited because xyz is their responsibility. If your partner is also okay with it, of course.\n\nBelieve me, I understand why you want your partner there, I would want that too. I think the real AHs here are the in-laws, not you or your sister.", "I\u2019m just going to ask, is anybody openly supporting her decision?? \n\nBecause sitting there idly by like \u201cI told you so,\u201d also isnt helping either.", "Yeah I never thought she was the AH. She's obviously under pressure but I think the pressure has resulted from her making a choice that was inevitably going to upset people. I don't necessarily think she's entitled to people being happy about it. \n\nThat's a nice idea though he has helped her design the menu and drinks pairings already.", "No, but there's not really any way to control that? She made a decision that was bound to upset people. I don't know if it's my responsibility to swallow my feelings just because she's made a choice people aren't happy about. I understand with very extended family somewhat, but her sister and the grooms brother's partners? Idk if I can get behind that."]}
