Amy is 18 now, Jack is 12. I am the stay-at-home homeschool dad, as my wife works and I've been early retired due to injury for over a decade now.\n\nThe other day, my daughter was on a walk with my wife (Jack and I were at home), where she admitted to my wife that she had regrets about being homeschooled and often felt lonely. She even said she had imaginary friends while being homeschooled, a condition called \"maladaptive daydreaming.\"\n\nWhen my wife told me what Amy said, I went to talk to her about it. I told her I was sorry to hear that she felt lonely, but also mentioned (briefly, with all good intentions) that she should have told us this when she was being homeschooled. She didn't really have an answer, other than saying something about that she felt she had to \"deal with the solitude\" and followed us in believing homeschooling was best for her...basically putting the blame back on us.\n\nI'll fast forward here, but she went on to insist that we were \"ruining\" Jack because we don't \"take him anywhere, get him involved anything, he doesn't have friends, he's never had friends, he's just with you all day.\" (Despite that not being true\u2013\u2013I frequently take Jack out to the movies/park/library/arcade during the week and he has two tutors he sees several times a week.)\n\nConversation eventually became an argument and Amy is convinced we are the worst parents in the world via homeschooling. Neither of our children has said anything about feeling lonely/joining groups and seem very happy...we figured they were content.

You take him to the movies, the park, the library, and the arcade, but it doesn't sound like you're letting him hang out with other kids. You should have gotten both your kids involved in extracurricular activities, like sports or clubs. You were the ones who chose to isolate your kids; it's one thing to homeschool them, but you should have encouraged them to socialize with other kids. Now you're blaming your daughter's loneliness on her? That's just lazy parenting right there. You and your wife are both selfish assholes who've failed your children. You were happy to isolate them from everyone else and now they're going to have a much harder time forming lives for themselves outside your home. But I bet you don't want that; you want to keep them as isolated as possible so that you can continue controlling them.", "YTA. \n\nPart of proper homeschooling is ensuring that your children have peer socialization WITHOUT you. You mentioned all of the places you take your son but did not mention any activities or teams he does without being with you. You mentioned tutors, which is not peer socialization. \n\nIt was not your daughter's responsibility to ensure she was getting what she needed, it was your responsibility to do so.", "\"...basically putting the blame back on us.\"  \n\n\nBut the blame BELONGS on you, and I say this as a homeschooling parent myself.   She was 12 years old when you started homeschooling her.   Twelve-year-olds don't have the power to choose their own education, and often don't have the communication skills or emotional maturity to do things like maturely tell their parents they are lonely.  That's why they're kids.   It's literally your job as a parent to check in, to find these things out, and to fix the situation.    \n\n\nYTA, and not because your daughter was lonely and you didn't know (though that is a problem).  You're the asshole because you attacked your daughter and tried to put the responsibility on her when she told you how she feels.    \n\n\nI'm sorry, told your wife--clearly, she knew how you would react.", "YTA. Give Jack a chance to hangout with kids his age. Damn. Who wants to be with their dad all day?", "YTA\n\nThe blame *is* on you, as the parents.  It absolutely is.\n\nEven now that she's pointing it out, you're still not seeing it, not really.\n\nTwo tutors and solo trips with dad are *great,* but they are very much not a social group of peers.  That's what she's trying to tell you.", "YTA. Have you ever asked Amy how she felt about home schooling? Yes of course she\u2019s going to try to convince herself homeschooling is good for her since your her parent and that\u2019s who she looks up to. Also Jack seeing his tutors is not a social life.", "YTA. \n\nI homeschool my youngest two (14 and 13). As parents, my partner and I made the decision to homeschool from the very beginning. That means the outcomes, unintended and intended, are on us.  We're responsible if (when: no one is a perfect parent) we screw it up. We're responsible for checking in with our kids to make sure that what is happening is still working for them. We're also responsible for fostering a relationship with our kids that means that when things aren't working, they feel comfortable with telling us. And we're responsible for making changes that make sure our kids' needs are being met.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter didn't feel like she could tell you when things stopped working for her. How do we know this? *Because she didn't tell you when things stopped working for her.* If she HAD felt comfortable telling you this back then, she would have.\n\nCombined with your response to her...well. You proved her point. \n\nYour daughter is right. You made assumptions about her feelings and opinions and you were wrong - don't make the same mistakes with your son. You need to be *offering* and *facilitating* opportunities for him to be making friends and interacting with other people, not just sitting back and waiting for him to say something. \n\nIt's hard to hear that our kids are not satisfied with - or are even upset by - how they have been parented and the choices we've made. My oldest is in her early 20s and yeah, some of our conversations have been eyeopening. Her experiences of things has been really different to mine at times. She's not had some of the context for somethings, and I've missed some big clues at others. But I'm also the parent and the adult, so I'm the one that gets to keep being responsible for handling things appropriately. \n\nAnd one last thing. It is really, really shitty to try and pathologise your daughter's response to massive loneliness by suggesting her coping mechanism is \"maladaptive daydreaming\". You've known about her imaginary friends for a metaphorical 5 seconds, no way has there been any kind of formal diagnosis. You're slapping that terminology in there as a way of distancing yourself from any kind of responsibility for her feelings and coping mechanisms, and it is both obvious and just all around shitty. Don't do it. Be better than that.", "Info: how many kids their own ages do your children socialize with on a regular basis? How many friends do they have outside of your family? I see no mention of that which is really, really concerning.", "YTA - she was a child. It\u2019s not her responsibility to tell you she wasn\u2019t okay okay when I doubt she had the words for that until recently. It was your job as her parent to check and make sure that she was okay.  It\u2019s not her fault you didn\u2019t do that, the blame IS on you.", "YTA. It's not your kids' job to tell you their social needs (which they don't even understand), it's your job to anticipate and try to fulfill them. And she's right about her little brother -- absolutely nothing in the few activities you list seems to bring him into regular contact with any kids his own age. Enroll him in some after-school activities like sports or music or scouts so he can have some friends. Don't repeat your mistake.", "YTA. I know people at my place of work who homeschool their children. Even though those kids are homeschooled, they still get them out and do extracurricular activities with kids their own age. Spending time with you and your wife is great and all, but your kids aren\u2019t going to develop the social skills that are going to be critical for them later in life if they don\u2019t interact with children their own age at the appropriate times. And just because your kids *seem* fine, they\u2019re kids. They don\u2019t have the understanding to know they should be meeting other kids. You\u2019re the parent, you *should* know better. You unfortunately did your daughter a disservice, and your son is well on his way to being paid that same disservice.", "YTA especially since you admit that the younger child only socializes with you and tutors. You literally proved her right. Take what you can learn from her now, to do better for your son. And do NOT minimize your role. \n\n>followed us in believing homeschooling was best for her...basically putting the blame back on us. \n\nShe obeyed, and you blame her???\n\nSwallow that ego, and learn from her. You have a choice to do better with your son. Kids have no choice in their upbringing. If you choose not to learn from this, you are willfully doing wrong.", "YTA. And your son is going to tell you the same thing eventually. You're robbing them of normal childhood experiences and that will always make you the asshole. But what moreso makes you one is that you came here for an 'unbiased opinion \" and you're arguing and scoffing at those opinions because, much like you did with your daughter, you'd rather think you're right than actually listening to anyone who tells you something you don't want to hear.", "I would say YTA.\n\nChildren won't know any better than they are taught. And, you cannot miss what you never had. It is not surprising your daughter never mentioned feeling lonely. Read back how you responded when she did - you got defensive. \n\nSocialising is important for children. Specifically with others their age. Where could they consistently meet others right now? Simple day trips won't do.\n\nHow about sports? Other hobby clubs? Have you and your wife thought about any 'after school activities'?\n\nMy point is, these children are going to have a very rough time when they go to college or into the workplace. Homeschooling can teach them the same materials as a school would, but they are still missing a large amount of knowledge and skills. \n\nHelp them, especially your youngest, now you still have time.", "YTA\n\nYou are putting adult perspectives onto a child.  She didn't know any different.  She likely thought it was normal to be lonely.  She was a kid.  How did she know what was out there if you sheltered her so that she had no idea what was going on in the outside world?\n\nShe is spot on correct with what you are doing to Jack.  It is another repeat of what you did to her.  Now that she is 18 she can take Jack places and socialise him if you let her.\n\nBut most homeschoolers that I know are very social.  They meet in groups for the socialisation each week.  But also have their kids participate in other activities to meet other kids like scouts or sports.\n\nI wonder if your wife didn't say or do anything to help her children because you are so controlling and wouldn't have allowed it.", "YTA in that you\u2019re pinning something on her and not listening. She wanted to please you and chose to suck it up bc of your commitment to homeschooling.\n\nShe\u2019s also communicating to you how not to repeat the same mistakes. There are plenty of opportunities for homeschooled kids to participate in group activities and get socialization. Put in the effort - when you homeschool you\u2019re responsible for more than just the three R\u2019s.", "YTA. You and your wife are both assholes. Homeschooling doesn't mean you should isolate your kids. And you did isolate them. You didn't encourage them to interact with other kids their own age. You didn't get them involved in any activities with other kids. Now you say it's your daughter's fault for being lonely, but it's not like you ever bothered to ask her how she felt about this whole situation. You and your wife are not good parents. Both your son and daughter should have their own friends. But you're selfish; you made their whole lives revolve around you because you can't stand the idea of them having their own lives and relationships with other people. It's going to be more difficult for them now to make friends and form real connections, and I think you want it to be more difficult for them so that they'll always be dependent on you. You're so selfish.", "YTA \n\nThere is nothing wrong with homeschooling your children, but they should have been enrolled jn community activities to help them develop social skills.", "YTA for not picking this up and entirely expect your children to take responsibility for this. Remember, you are the parent.", "YTA. Not only are you wrong in completely isolating your son from kids his own age and denying him the socialization skills he desperately needs, but you are being dismissive to your daughter when she is being honest about her own life experiences in an effort to help her little brother. She isn\u2019t saying you are the worst parents ever, and by the way, congrats on the passive aggressive response. She is trying to tell you mistakes were made and it\u2019s not too late to fix things for your son. Be a good parent and actually listen to your child.", "YTA, from your reaction I see why she didn't tell anything, she wanted to keep peace and you are depriving your kids for what is essential for them, being among their peers and propper education. Because kids don't learn just from teachers but from peers. They need to see other people habits and beliefs to grow and mature healthily. Maybe try to listen to your daughter who is trying to be brave to save her brother's teenage years even if it means your rage outburst.", "YTA. You\u2019re manipulative and punishing as well. Your daughter told you how she felt, all you had to say is I\u2019m sorry. She has insights you don\u2019t. And how on earth can you expect a child to tell you how she felt then when this is how you treat her today? \n\nHer loneliness IS YOUR FAULT. That\u2019s not an indictment on homeschooling but it is one on your version of it. You should be apologizing and listening to her so you dont repeat the same mistakes with another child. \n\nAll you\u2019ve done is taught her it\u2019s wrong to be honest with mom and dad because they scream and punish if they don\u2019t like what they hear", "Based on your replies to the comments, I can see why your daughter didn\u2019t feel she could express her feelings. It\u2019s possible she thought the way she was feeling was wrong and was struggling with that all these years. \n\nYTA but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready to accept that.", "YTA\n\n\nHumans have social needs. A 12 year old without friends? A teenager with imagined friends? Both severely unhealthy. \n\n\nI honestly would bet that your daughters resentment isn't even fully developt yet. Somewhere in her 20s she will realise the full scope of consequences she will have to deal with for years to come and that she wont be able to get back what you took from her. It is honestly very kind that she tries to save her brother from this.\n\n\n\nA lot of people have childhood friends for their entire life. \n\n\nSocialisation with people your age is sooo important. She will struggle to built connections. \n\n\nThat your kids don't visit a music groups, do a team sport or anything sounds so extrem lazy and semfish of you. You say that your 12 year old gets out enough by being with you kind of says all. You don't care. As long as it stays easy for you, you very literally don't care.", "INFO: Why did you suddenly switch to homeschool for your daughter? And has your son been homeschooled his whole life?", "Get your kids into after school sports teams and clubs while you can. That way they will be able to socialise with kids THEIR AGE. WITHOUT YOU.

The lack of socialization has stunted the children and they don\u2019t know how to effectively communicate and express their needs outside of the home. \n\nWhen they get to college, it all goes sideways. Some are so quiet you\u2019re worried something is desperately wrong. Some don\u2019t know when to stop answering the teacher\u2019s rhetorical questions or give someone else a turn. Some go wild (guzzle alcohol instead of sip and get poisoned right off the bat) if you do include them. \n\nIt\u2019s much harder for homeschooled kids to make friends. They didn\u2019t have the same struggles, joys,  and rites of passage as their peers. There\u2019s a real feeling of \u201cother\u201d and most kids pick up on that.", "YTA", "Your post and subsequent comments to others here shows you are unwilling to see for what it is. Your argument is that she could've expressed all this before but didn't-- is she not expressing it NOW and it is clear she is unhappy? What's the point of arguing about the could haves or what appears then when you now know what is? Is it because you're afraid of facing the fact that you made the wrong decision for her (for her) as a parent, and it's too much to handle so you deflect her truth now? Blame her for accepting her circumstances then?\n \nJust because \"she's a teen and capable of expressing herself\" doesn't mean much when she is/was still a child. She was 12 when this homeschooling started! As children, we look up to our parents and believe they are guiding us on the right path -- she even expressed now that she thought this was \"supposed\" to be the way. Have you tried placing yourself in her shoes?  Imagine yourself as a child and people you really look up to told you something is the way... would you not believe them? You didn't have a reason not to believe them and didn't have more experiences outside that bubble to reason otherwise. \nYour son is/was even younger, ofc he wouldn't question any of this. He is being conditioned to believe this is it and this is the best. Perhaps when he gets older like his sis, he'd feel the same.\n\nYour daughter's concern for her brother is valid because it is based on her own experiences. You should be able to understand that, and good for her for trying to look after his best interests. Now that doesn't mean you aren't and weren't trying to. I'm sure you are also doing the best you feel is the best. I'm sure you strive to be the best parent. There's no one size fits all when it comes to parenting or life, and it's always a continually learning experience. In this case, your daughter is expressing that homeschooling no longer works for her, and it has taken away from her-- please listen.\n\nYour son interacting with tutors for tutoring isn't the same as having a social life outside this bubble. You taking him out and him being happy to spend time with you is also different from him having interactions outside this bubble. \n\nWe all have different life choices and hence experiences, so I'm not going to project to you what I believe is best. But considering you are keeping them in a bubble \ud83e\udee7 , how do you think life would be for them when they step out much later? How do you believe humans learn? Is it not by life experiences? \n\n\nYour daughter is now making her own choice, with reason. \nI know you're doing your best, but blaming her for a decision you made and put upon her also isn't it. \n\nI hope you can expose your son more of life outside said bubble and what has been conditioned, and give him opportunities to decide for himself and not take that away like you did with your daughter. \n\nA human can only thrive so much under a controlled environment. That controlled environment also cannot sustain forever.. \n\n\nAlso, if it isn't clear, YTA here. Not because of a decision already made which turned out to be a mistake for your child, but for unwilling to turn this around and listen. YTA for shifting blame on something you decided on. You don't have to be berated for a mistake, just focus on the present and solving what's at hand. Accept what didn't work and progress together... \nFoster a healthy environment where there is open communication and no finger pointing. I'm sure you wouldn't want to strain your relationship with your child, or cause her to feel she cannot be honest with you.", "So you argue with her, and think when she was smaller she should have been able to defend herself better from you while smaller and younger?\n\nYTA. I love how you try to gaslight us too  with your little diagnosis there.\n\nYou are quite the manipulator.", "YTA- I think you have your answer about why she didn\u2019t tell you she was lonely.

Additionally, in what world is it a child\u2019s responsibility to tell you how your actions are affecting them? They are children and wouldn\u2019t have known better.

You are definitely handicapping you son if he has no friends. Social development is critical to success in life. This needs to be addressed immediately.", "YTA\n\nIm going to make this as short as possible.\n\nShe gave you an honest opinion on your parenting. You just give an insensitive half-arsed response.

And I was the one who did the research on the highschools in my area, and presented it to her.

Amy is 18 now, Jack is 12. I am the stay-at-home homeschool dad, as my wife works and I've been early retired due to injury for over a decade now.\n\nThe other day, my daughter was on a walk with my wife (Jack and I were at home), of which I found out from my wife that they were talking, and Amy admitted she had some regrets about being homeschooled and felt lonely. She even admitted she had imaginary friends during the six years she was homeschooled, a condition called \"maladaptive daydreaming.\"\n\nWhen my wife told me what Amy said, I had a small talk with her about what I heard, that she felt lonely in the past. I told her I was sorry to hear that, but also mentioned (very quickly, innocently) that she should have told us when she was being homeschooled. She didn't really have an answer, other than mumbling something about she felt she had to \"deal with the solitude\" and followed us in believing homeschooling was best for her...basically putting the blame back on us. \n\nI'll fast forward here, but our discussion getting kind of heated as she insisted we were \"ruining\" Jack because we don't \"take him anywhere, get him involved anything, he doesn't have friends, he's never had friends, he's just with you all day.\" (Despite that not being true\u2013\u2013I frequently take Jack out to the movies/park/library/arcade during the week and he has two tutors he sees several times a week.)\n\nConversation eventually became an argument and Amy is convinced we are the worst parents in the world via homeschooling. Neither of our children has said anything about feeling lonely/joining groups and seem very happy...we figured they were content. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A massive part of home educating is for you to ensure that your children are still getting interaction within your own peer group. That's not on your kids to tell you, that's for you to pre empt. Surely you just know that for a 12 year old boy,going to the park with you or going to see a film with you isn't the same as going to the movies with a group of friends? And two tutors a week definitely doesn't make up for the lack of social skills he is missing out on. I'm sorry but I think you have failed on their education by not ensuring that they have also had \"lessons\" on how to interact with their peers,how to make friends, how to deal with peer group conflicts etc. That is also something they need to learn and I also feel sorry for Amy that she has got to 18 before she is comfortable enough to tell you how she feels.

Homeschooling is already incredibly isolating and you choose not to expose your kids to other children their age. Socializing is also a skill they need to learn, not just the academics. You\u2019ve failed to give your kids everything they need to succeed in life, which is the whole purpose of homeschooling.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who has been bullied relentlessly in my primary school career. It was horrible, but with the support of my parents it made me who I am today, because it taught me right from wrong in a social sense.

The trust she had to have, because she was a child who could/did not get decide this path herself.\n\nYour daughter is trying to prevent this from repeating because she cares about her brother and you are shoving this right back in her face. Not really a healthy way to deal with this issue and it\u2019s also showing that you apparently didn\u2019t pick up any cues that this was going on. You missed out on important social cues your daughter most likely gave you in order to keep telling yourself it was for her best interest. \n\nWell done, keep this up and you\u2019ll have two kids who are most likely not capable of distinguishing between what healthy and unhealthy socializing is like, because you\u2019re trying to protect them from horrible things.

How homeschooling can be allowed in a developed country is for me an enigma, big Enigma. She's right, you are the AH. As a teacher myself I would never ever homeschool my children bc nobody can fill the void of socializing and making friendships and have all the knowledge a child needs to manage out in the big world outside the home.", "YTA. When I homeschooled my daughter, she was always going places - classes, library programs, athletic outings, homeschool holiday parties, workshops. We even did postcard exchanges with kids from all over the world. There is SO much for homeschooled kids to allow them to socialize and make friends. She made friends with kids of all ages and she learned how to talk to adults. Now she\u2019s outgoing, with a group of friends, and is in the gifted program at her school. It takes work and effort on your part but it is so well worth it. YOU have to do the work to find activities that your son will be interested in.

While they did clubs and classes like ours, they also had social gatherings for the kids to just play and make friends; many of the families who attended with us had playdates and other clubs they attended with the same groups so that the kids had the ability to make and maintain friendships.\n\nIt is not your children's job to tell you when your parenting is lacking.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re trying to deflect blame to your children???\n\nShe is right, kids need other kids.
