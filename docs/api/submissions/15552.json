My Dad wrote 3 notes for our 3 teachers, just incase we were late or missed homework.\nI understand your wife was there for her Mums ashes so her emotions would be all over the place and she's grieving which is why she is also NTA.\n\nI think you two need to just have a little sit down chat about how you are both feeling.

You should get over yourself, it's just basic parenting, remember that if you end up single you'll be doing a lot more of it. \n\nFrom the way you describe it, it sounds like your wife could also be more positive in the way she co-parents and relates to you. Perhaps she usually takes a lead on parenting as she has super high standards and that's why you found 2 weeks on your own with a cold so hard? There is something about your tone though (and the fact you clearly posted this expecting sympathy) that makes me suspect you built up a ton of resentment for having to parent for 2 weeks and were ready to unleash it as soon as your wife issued any criticism.\n\nMaybe rather than work out who has handled this reaction worst, you could have a discussion about how you both want to co-parent to make things manageable for both of you as your daughter enters this more independent phase.", "YTA \n\nSo you were an actual parent for a massive, incredibly long 2 whole weeks, and actually think you\u2019ve done something special.

Why is everyone saying OP isn\u2019t impressive for watching child for two weeks because they\u2019re a man?

Show me any parent who\u2019s never been a single parent that wouldn\u2019t make a mistake or two when they have to parent alone for two weeks. I know there\u2019s many truly amazing single parents who\u2019s whole lives is what OPs two weeks was like, but I also doubt that\u2019s a workload they\u2019d wish upon other people.

If OP is the main provider, then I don't think he deserves the amount of shade being thrown his way for not being on top of everything.\n\nI can't say anything about the wife's complaint because, given the situation, she is more than likely dealing with a lot of different and difficult emotions. So, something small like OP forgetting a single language class on the same day that she is getting home can cause a response that is felt to be unearned for the situation.\n\nI think both of them are responding like human beings. OP is feeling unappreciated and wants to know if his wife's response to this slip up is deserved. OP's wife is dealing with a lot of emotions between her mom's death and being back in her home country, which those two combined are potentially making it all even worse due to reliving childhood memories.\n\nOP should give his wife some time to grieve and mourn and take some of her comments with a grain of salt for a while.\n\nOverall, there are a ton of factors that play into this situation, and we don't know most of them.

A few days doing single parent things on your own is HARD, from things being split and now the load of work and kids is entirely on you is a whole lot. I\u2019m happy the both of you extend grace to each other !", "Out of all the touristy things a local can do, the Underground Tour is definitely at the top.", "Don't visit the gum wall though.  I think that may be one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen.", "FYI EMP is now \u201cMoPop\u201d (museum of popular culture). I still slip up and call it the old name sometimes, but I\u2019m slowly learning to accept it. (I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get the hang of CenturyLink Stadium changing to Lumen Field, though.)", "Yeah that\u2019s why I\u2019m confused, he wasn\u2019t complaining about having to parent, he just made it clear that he was not trying to interrupt his wife\u2019s  trip. He\u2019s upset that the first thing she does when she gets back is complain herself", "Yeah that\u2019s my point, and OP said he became sick the last week. It\u2019s even easier for things to slip through the cracks while being sick. People are too quick to jump at someone\u2019s throats for simple mistakes. Id argue NAH simply because the wife is probably just stressed out from the death of their mother and everything, OP was doing their best to maintain the household and let one thing slip and the 9 year old is doing great at existing", "100 percent. If you're a bloke, find somewhere else to ask for impartial advice. This sub reeks of bitterly unhappy middle aged women with a huge vendetta against anyone with a penis, and you can spot it a mile off.", "She doesn\u2019t have to micromanage. She has to accept that his way- when sick- is ok. If you can\u2019t handle things being done another way, then don\u2019t go anywhere. It took a therapist telling me this- I was a 40f with 3 kids who could lnt understand why my husband couldn\u2019t make a dinner I had planned. \n\nThe kids were whole and safe while she was gone. Everything Else is details.", "That\u2019s a hell of a lot of qualifiers to justify making shit up.", "Explain how my comment is sexist.", "Oh yeah I totally forgot they changed it \ud83d\ude02 I haven\u2019t been back since they had the labyrinth and Pearl Jam exhibits", "THANK you", "I liked the aquarium, but haven't been in YEARS. I also recommend the previous rec for the underground tour.", "Lived here my whole life and never done the underground tour, maybe I need to finally make plans.", ">e is in another country, it isn't a \" normal\" thing for men to care for the children. So it might be a major thing for him to have been the sole parent for 2 weeks.  W\n\nWell to be fair, nowhere on the post does the OP say they are a he 'husband' could be a lesbian couple.  Since we're talking assumptions and all.\n\nThat said NTA, I would be upset if they came at me like that, but also I would be understanding, it's possible it's just mis-directed grief.", "In the OP, it's not clear though, could be a female/lesbian couple.", "Except that isn't what he asked. He didn't ask for her validation, just not to be dumped on before his wife even walked in the door. And as I have said in a few comments, I am one person scheduling just for me, and I forget or double-book appointments regularly. It's a thing that happens. How much harder would it be to do that for an entire other person as well? Things are going to be missed every once in a while, especially when you have the added stress of suddenly being the only parent juggling everything. It takes time to adjust to that. They also had a big exam coming up, that likely overshadowed everything else. I can tell you, I used to be a mess during exams because of stress (I know she is only 9, but all exams feel like the biggest test of your life)"]}
