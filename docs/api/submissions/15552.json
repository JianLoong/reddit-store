During the last week I was not feeling well. A bad cough, fatigue, headache, migraine and etc. Not sure what was going on but I really wasn't all that well. When we facetime she asked me what was going on and I told her. Again wasn't complaining or asking her to come back. \n\nFast forward to this Sunday night. My wife comes back, lands and the first thing she does after her plan lands is not I'm back, or I miss you guys. She messages me complaining we (me and my daughter) missed the online language class. I told her that yes, I forgot between dinner and everything that was happening it just escaped my mind. I told her it was no intentional.

You should get over yourself, it's just basic parenting, remember that if you end up single you'll be doing a lot more of it. \n\nFrom the way you describe it, it sounds like your wife could also be more positive in the way she co-parents and relates to you.

There is something about your tone though (and the fact you clearly posted this expecting sympathy) that makes me suspect you built up a ton of resentment for having to parent for 2 weeks and were ready to unleash it as soon as your wife issued any criticism.\n\nMaybe rather than work out who has handled this reaction worst, you could have a discussion about how you both want to co-parent to make things manageable for both of you as your daughter enters this more independent phase.", "YTA \n\nSo you were an actual parent for a massive, incredibly long 2 whole weeks, and actually think you\u2019ve done something special.

He doesn\u2019t sound like a supportive partner, her mom died. I would be shutting up and saying everything is excellent and we are doing great to allow her the mental break. Like imagine being on a trip stressed about your mom being dead and how you and your brother will move forward with a missing parent, only to hear I have a cold, a headache, I\u2019m miserable. I wouldn\u2019t have the mental capacity to deal with those complaints, I\u2019m getting my moms ashes. \n\nIt\u2019s not the suffering olympics or anything but man some perspective here would have made it better."]}
