You have every right to prevent people from exploiting your child for views. \n\nNo need to explain yourself to teens. They\u2019ll understand when they\u2019re older", "NTA. Regardless of the legalities, it's hugely problematic to turn other people into content without their/their parents' consent. The is especially true when it comes to minors. I suspect that this is something that will be legislated at some point because it has become completely egregious.", "NTA \n\nBut if you worry you were too harsh, if this happens again you can still step in between and say \"Please don't film my child especially without permission. It's not cool\" just keep it chill and if they push back then get aggressive. We unfortunately live in a society where filming is the thing to do so some kids are oblivious to things like asking permission to film others when it's so common place now.  But you weren't wrong.", "NTA. When you are out in public, you have to expect some amount of lack of privacy. I don't know the legality and honestly, I don't think it matters - my opinion is common etiquette is that you should ask before filming or taking a picture of someone at all, especially if it is a child. Whether or not they are legally in the wrong, I still think they are the AHs here.", "NTA\n\nIt's completely fair to request they do not record your child without your permission.", "NTA. \n\nThats your kid, some maybe okay with it some arnt. They should respect it.", "NTA.\n\nFrom their comment they were objecting to your tone and not your request.\n\nAs the paparazzi understand well, you don't have an expectation of privacy in a public setting.  So if they did post a video of your child in public, you'd have a tough time forcing them to take it down.  So, you have to \"spoil the shot\" by blocking the camera, moving the subject, whatever it takes.", "NTA\n\nEveryone all up in arms about \"it's legal\". It's fucking creepy is what it is. I don't care if you have the legal right to video tape in public. I draw the line at taking videos of children. \n\nYou people haven't come across the type of people that actually don't give a shit about the law. If people did this in my hometown, the teenagers would have probably gotten their asses kicked and not just yelled at.", "NTA for defending your daughters privacy. You might have been harsh with the kids (kind of hard to tell, but it doesn\u2019t matter), but there was no harm. \n\nIt\u2019s likely the kids had never even thought about digital privacy. I\u2019ve noticed an interesting divide over the past decade. I\u2019m in my mid-30s with a preschooler. Most of my same-age friends who had their kids in their teens and early 20s shared tons of stuff about those kids online, and just about all of us who had our kids later haven\u2019t shared much of anything. It\u2019s possible the teens you encountered had parents who raised them online, so it never even occurred to them not to film a baby. Maybe you gave them something to think about.", "NTA, I would have done the same thing if it was my child", "NTA your child cannot make an informed decision to consent to being filmed and put on social media. The teens need to be respectful of not putting other people on the internet.", "NTA, and those teens are rude. You are correct that it is never okay. I'm sorry they called you a Karen, which would make me bristle, too. But respecting your child's privacy is more important than their snit.", "NTA. Exploiting someone else\u2019s child for views is wrong. Especially if they ask you not to. You child deserves respect and privacy. People on tik tok can be complete CREEPS. Protect your baby mama bear.", "NTA - they probably don't realize how valuable privacy is yet, and you definitely did the right thing. \n\n2 year olds dancing are the best though!", "ESH. Regardless of legality, it\u2019s really inappropriate to film someone\u2019s child without the permission of the parent. \n\nThat being said, I think you could have approached the situation more calmly and attempted to deescalate rather than escalate. They are teenagers and still learning themselves.", "YTA. They are allowed and are GUARANTEED that right by the constitution. You can ask them not to but you cant require it of them. And they wont see it as disrespectful. Next time, just roll up the window and find another spot.", "NTA\n\n\nI'm seeing comments saying filming the video in public is legal. So is standing in the way of something you don't wish to be filmed in public. Protect your kids.", "YTA for the way you approached the request, keep in mind that in public there is no expectation of privacy. \n\nThe request itself was fair but since, \n\n- YOU pulled up next to them \n- YOUR kid danced to their music\n- YOU escalated first instead of politely asking (I scolded)\n\nHave to go with YTA\n\nHad you made a polite request instead of an aggressive one, I\u2019d have given this to you.", "Obvious YTA.

And I don't even have children myself, but no one would film a child which is with me without asking first.", "Especially since up skirting videos have been deemed legal. You need to protect you and your child!", "You don't film a random child without askibg the parents. I can't understand this. Even if it's \"technically legal\". Thats not something you do...", "I say scolded because I used a stern voice but I didn\u2019t yell. I also didn\u2019t call them names or make a personal attack. I would irrefutably be the asshole if I had yelled at them.\n\nAlso, the parking lot had 3 spots excluding the handicap spot. There wasn\u2019t really a bother option as to where I could park.", "Really depends where OP is from, most states have laws about filming without consent, especially when it comes to minors. NTA OP, it's creepy to film a kid without the parents permission", "We're not in r/technicallynotillegal or something. What do you think the definition of an asshole is?\n\n\nIf you were out on a walk and someone followed you filming (or any number of other things they technically have a right to do in public), would you think they might just be an asshole despite them not breaking the law?", "Wrongo", "This isn't a legal sub, it's a moral sub. While the teens may have a legal right to record, morally they should really ask the parent before recording a young child where you can presumably clearly see and identify the child (i.e.  they are not just randomly in the background)", "There are literal laws against being recorded without your consent", "Well I hope all these people that like to legally harass others get what's coming to them. One of these days they're going to record the wrong person and they'll see how little the \"law\" protects them.", "In the US, there aren't laws against filming in public. Otherwise, how is any cringe/fail/public freakout compilation even in existence? There may be some related to how you use that footage, but not just for recording.", "FOLLOWING you and filming you is different from you walking up on someone already filming, and so they add you to the shot.", "Yes, but they don't apply to public spaces. How do you think security cameras work?", "NTA, but want to clarify expectations around privacy and laws around it. \n\nThere\u2019s no expectation of privacy in public in the United States.

Men, women, children, whoever.", "There is actually a bizarre lawsuit against Glass Staircases in a public buildings because it is legal to stand under the staircase and record women in skirts walking up the steps. It is sick!", "Yes, any example of a similar situation would be different in some way, unless it was literally the exact same situation. It's about thinking about things from a different angle to develop a better perspective.\n\n\nthis bullshit \"I found a difference in your similar example, therefore I discredit everything you said\" is so tiring.", "They purposely put on music for toddlers to get the kid to react", "You're arguing really hard about being allowed to video tape children. Major creep vibes dude.", "So if I walk up to a stranger at a bus stop, say \u201cI\u2019m recording you\u201d and do just that despite them telling me not to, that\u2019s not harassment?", "I literally have no idea how you think that's harassment.", "In Nebraska you wouldn't even need to tell them you're recording as long as you're part of the communication. New York state used to be this way as well. Idr the other single party consent to record states", "So the law is all about wording. \n\nIf you go up to the individual and SAY you are recording them and keep in their face, then you CAN be charged with harassment. \n\nIf on the other hand, you\u2019re merely recording, without interacting with them, then no, you\u2019re not harassing and you cannot be charged as such.", "I highly doubt you would be ok with that but sure, it\u2019s not harassment", "That\u2019s fair enough. So, if the teens in the op kept recording, that would fall under harassment then?", "I didn't say I would be okay with it? lol. That wasn't the question.", "No. It wouldn\u2019t. They\u2019re not harassing the OP. They\u2019re merely recording in public. If OP doesn\u2019t like being recorded, they can move away. They\u2019re not \u201cin OP\u2019s face\u201d.

It\u2019s a reasonable ask to request not to film one\u2019s child. Merely stating that the law is not on her side about it though.

Maybe they had a legal right to film in a public place, I don't care, I am so utterly sick of Tik Tok bullshit and everyone filming each other when we're all just going about our day.
