I\u2019ve noticed an interesting divide over the past decade. I\u2019m in my mid-30s with a preschooler. Most of my same-age friends who had their kids in their teens and early 20s shared tons of stuff about those kids online, and just about all of us who had our kids later haven\u2019t shared much of anything.
