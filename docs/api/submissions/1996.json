For example my husband doesn't like onions or greens when our family / friends invite us they seperate the food for him.", "NAH but a whole pig roast is a very graphic way to cook an animal. Even meat eaters can find it a bit much to look at. It's not like you're just putting some meat dishes on a buffet, you're making a big event of cooking a whole animal and serving it. \n\nChoosing to do this on a major holiday is very alienating for your family members who may find the spectacle horrifying. But, if you're able to make the pit area visually obscured so that people have to make an effort to approach and see the cooking that would be a good way to compromise.

Can I come?", "NAH - as soon as the word vegan is used everyone starts whining about people forcing their choices on others. \n\nNon-vegan family members have said that it might be an idea not to do this as a courtesy. This isn't about vegans, this is about being considerate. I eat meat, but I can't imagine being as pathetic as to make it my identity. \n\nI think if the yard is small (it sounds it) then OP is being an asshole for making the neighbourhood smell of pig. \n\nIf the yard is big enough to still have an outdoor space for everyone then I think that there is no asshole here. I would personally have it out of view if possible, even non-vegans don't necessarily want to see a dead pig.

Why does it matter?  \n\nA turkey meal is a roasted decapitated animal corpse, the ham is from chopping an animal to pieces. But those are acceptable presentations to a vegan because...?"]}
