I would personally have it out of view if possible, even non-vegans don't necessarily want to see a dead pig.

The vegans were already going to a party with meat, how that meat is presented isn't really relevant.", "Then they can stay home and have tofurkey alone.", "Nope. They're literally complaining that op is having the pig.", "bro we get it you\u2019re vegan stop commenting on everyone\u2019s posts", "You know how frustrating it is that so many people find vegans insufferable? Your barrage of comments is one of the examples of why.", "Jesus, you'd go to the house of someone that enjoys dogfighting, even if they weren't doing it that day?", "At first I thought /u/Omnibeneviolent was just a general vegan troll with too much time on their hands, but now I'm starting to think they just REALLY like to talk about dog fighting and don't get many other opportunities to do it.", "Philippines? Their roast pigs are incredible. Let the Vegans know ahead of time, and if they choose not to come send me an invite.", "Honestly it would make me squeamish af even though it sounds delicious and I would love to try some ! I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some of the comments are coming from people that are themselves uncomfortable with the image or idea and are just blaming it on the potential annoyance dnd discomfort of the vegan family members, \n\nBarrier and heads up is a great idea though!", "I used to raise chickens and my kids participated. A family member raised meat rabbits,, When you lose an animal to injury, behaviour, or predation, you learn that quick orderly slaughter is not of itself a bad thing.", "Definitely a step up from standard grocery store meat. OP, as someone who doesn\u2019t eat meat for ethical reasons, I think your plan is ok as long as you keep the pig out back and tell the vegans ahead of time that the pig will be there. They can make their own decision on whether they want to attend. It\u2019s not reasonable for them to expect no meat, but it\u2019s also reasonable for them to not want to see a pig roasting on a spit.", "I mean, with the number of siblings you mentioned, and at least one with married kids and a pack of grandkids, I\u2019m guessing at least 50. One pig might not be enough!", "It's not, but 60 pounds of meat is going to fragrance the back yard in a way that a 10 pound piece won't.  \n\nI mean, I've been to pig roasts, and the entire block knew someone was roasting pork.", "Oh well then I'd say you're in the clear! \n\nIt can be kinda jarring if they don't expect it and there's no warning but they're aware and decide for themselves if they want to attend. I'm honestly not sure why anyone else if getting involved if you've already informed the only people who could be upset.", "But you should also take into consideration the sensitivities of any guests you are inviting. You might not want to show a war movie with a lot of bombs going off in it if your Uncle has PTSD, for example.", "How?? They're always so subtle.", "Do you have a sincere moral or ethical objection to eating plants?", "Then they can not go. It's not violent, it's food. It is normal to eat food and this is simply a way of preparing a type of food. If someone is uncomfortable, it is up to them to manage that and decide how to handle. If it will be too much, they have the choice not to put themselves in the situation.", "That's entirely their problem, if they don't like it they don't have to attend. The fact they are already catering food options to people making a dietary choice out of a false sense of morality is more than sufficient.", "Then they can choose not to attend. Simple.", "So what if they have a 4th of July BBQ and have steaks and ribs? Or chicken and burgers? Should they change that for the vegans too?", "Looking at some of the other comments that they've left, it's clear that they enjoy being the most insufferable person possible. I think they've made it their life goal to have everyone on the planet hate them for one reason or another.", "Yup. He is very excited to help me do one, as we have showed up early and helped him a few times", "Depends on where you're from. There will be many a pig in la caja china on Christmas Eve where I am. It's good to know from where your food comes.", "In our family if you are having a large enough get together to make roasting a whole pig reasonable, then it is expected that they would be invited. \n\nSeveral family friend will also be a Christmas. We have many friends who are from other countries and have little family here, so the friend/family lines tend to get blurred. \n\nHell, we through our nephew a 21st birthday party and grandma and his mom and aunts took a few shots with him and his friends.", "Good thing you aren\u2019t invited", "Probaby a few more as we also have a couple of friends coming with their family. We are also are making a ham and turkey, and usually several family members will bring dishes, Including those who are vegan bringing a main dish", "they are hosting an event. people are free to come or not. if they told their family they were having a movie night with a war movie, uncle could make the decision not to go.", "Being vegan is a choice, having PTSD isn't. I can't believe I just had to type that sentence", "What kind of mental gymnastics did you have to go through to compare veganism with PTSD?", "But if the movie is playing in an area where the uncle can't hear it and be triggered by it, and everyone else really wants to watch Dunkirk, and uncle is made aware of the situation before hand and told how to avoid it, then .........   \n\nSounds like the pig is gonna be easy to avoid, they've given plenty of fair warning, and most people attending are not vegan.", "I did pay attention to their sensitivity. But again, meat eaters shouldn't only have vegan options to make a vegan happy unless a vegan only has meat eating options for meat eaters. You can't say it's only okay to respect one group of people and not the other because you don't like it. You make people aware, think of them, then the rest is up to them. I have several vegan friends who respect meat eaters. I think you are taking this to an unnecessary tangent that I'm not interested in furthering in to.", "They ARE taking them into consideration - they have vegan options available", "That's such an extremel example of false equivalency I don't know whether to be horrified or impressed. PTSD happens because of something horrible happening to someone, not eating meat is a choice.", "No, the point of a pig roast is that pigs roasted whole taste *really* good, are super practical as well as an unusual treat for big groups, and modern home kitchens don\u2019t come equipped to handle a whole beast that size. If you want enough pork for this size of crowd and you have even a generously sized kitchen, you pretty much have to do a pit, a spit, or a drum. The entertainment value is a mere side effect.\n\nAnd it\u2019s good for us omnivores to at least sometimes handle our meat while it still looks like what it is, an actual animal. Buying nice little plastic-wrapped bits is a way of sanitizing and hiding the process. It seems disrespectful and weirdly unhealthy to be always hiding from the reality of what we are and do. (Recently, my teens and I bought pumpkins from a neighbour\u2019s patch that is cleared each fall by porkers they will eventually serve up in their barbecue truck. As soon as pumpkin time is over, the pigs are turned out in that field to eat the unsold pumpkins and fertilize everything. We love them, they\u2019re beautiful and happy and healthy and that\u2019s how they live. In a few weeks or months, we\u2019ll get some hella good pulled pork. We don\u2019t have the land to keep our own pigs, though we raised poultry when we had the space, and my godmother raised meat rabbits.)\n\n\nVegans can choose to cope or not attend. They\u2019re being accommodated with food they can enjoy, and the ability to not be part of the backyard activities. If they feel it\u2019s all murder\u2014well, this pig is no more a victim than any of the animals served at past dinners elsewhere. If they can\u2019t bear it, they should at least be consistent and not attend other events where meat is shared.", "That\u2019s not true, it\u2019s not about entertainment it\u2019s about the taste of the animal. Meat tastes differently depending on the cut and how it\u2019s cooked. An outdoor roast has a unique taste and by cooking the animal while you\u2019re getting more tasty fat into different parts of the animal. It\u2019s no more a spectacle than smoking a brisket is, you\u2019re getting the most tasty food by cooking it this way.", "Eating meat is not glorifying violence against animals ffs. We are omnivores. We are literally designed to eat meat as well as vegetables. Stop comparing eating meat to dog fighting.", "I was vegetarian for 20 years and vegan for like half of that time, and I\u2019m getting second hand embarrassed over here. A pig roast is not entertainment, it\u2019s a way to cook food. \n\nFucking embarrassing. \n\nI think that eating soy-based products, grown on land that used to be the Amazon rain forest until giant American corporations snatched it up, is, depending on the pig that they bought (how it was raised; how it died) a far bigger detriment to animal welfare and biodiversity. Unless of course the only violence agains non-human life that matters is violence against domesticated animal species.\n\nRegardless, the roast is not a show, again, it is a method of cooking. Should they get rid of the grill and the oven, lest that be a provocative show, too?", "A pig roast is an awesome thing, it is not entertainment, it is the host saying, I love you guys, come, eat, drink and enjoy.", "I have an ethical objection to mass farming and soil erosion. Does that count?", "I have a sincere ethical objection to being forced to follow someone else's ethics.", "I absolutely do.  It deprives rabbits and deer of much needed nutrition.", "I would go hungry because of allergies", "Both these takes are valid and have kernels of truth but are just on the more extreme ends of the spectrum- yours and the person you commented in response to. You should both consider how op is handling this as the best way to mediate these points in a respectful and decent way. \n\nI\u2019m not vegan and love a good roast but honestly I would be uncomfortable and disturbed at the idea of a whole pig spit roasted as being a form of entertainment and as a prominent display at my family gathering for a holiday. I have vegan friends that wouldn\u2019t consider it as graphic or disturbing as I would. I totally get op\u2019s perspective too about it being a method of preparation that\u2019s been on the bucket list for a while and this is the perfect opportunity. A whole entire spit roasted pig being cooked over a hand dug pit in a suburban yard is very much out of the norm and unexpected- it\u2019s fair to give people a heads up rather than blindside therm. \n\nAnd While my squeamishness is my issue and concern, I would still hope that my family member host that has taken on the obligation of hosting a yearly large Christmas gathering for our family members would have my feelings in mind at least some .  Idk how much smoke this is going to generate but that would also concern me and potentially trigger my asthma - I would again hope a family member would consider and maybe t try and mitigate something like that causing me distress or harm.\n\nOp\u2019s comments hit upon the idea of constructing a barrier of sorts to visually block what might be disturbing or difficult for some guests but still allows for op to cook and serve it. That\u2019s a much better approach than either walking on imaginary eggshells and bending over backwards to cater to the potential of offense you aren\u2019t even sure would come to fruition as well as your take which is that\u2019s the person that feels uncomfortable\u2019s problem and you will do nothing and show no concern and they should just stay home.", "> It's not violent, it's food. \n\nTo the vegans, it's a representation of actual violence that happened against the pig. \n\n>It is normal to eat food and this is simply a way of preparing a type of food.\n\nA particularly graphic way that glorifies violence against animals.\n\n>If it will be too much, they have the choice not to put themselves in the situation.\n\nI agree 100%.", "That honestly sounds like the other people are the problem- her not complaining to you is an active choice. Perhaps she\u2019s just venting or thinking that these people are willing to discuss it with her beforehand so she isn\u2019t putting that on you to deal with. They shouldn\u2019t be coming and telling you this behind her back when she hasn\u2019t shown that she is asking you to do something different than your current plan", "After looking up some pics to see how whole pigs are usually roasted, I find it a little horrifying. (The eyes!) And I\u2019m a solid omnivore. I think if you can find a way to have a visual barrier of some sort, it would be good. Even if you could just do it on the side of the house and block the view with a car or something. \n\nLike, I would still be totally game for it and would enthusiastically eat the meat. But the visual is going to be a bit much for some people.", "Are you roasting it on a spit or more like in a pit where it will be covered in coals?", "Another idea which may or may not be feasible would be to kind of split the roasting portion of the event from the rest. Invite anyone who wants to participate in the pig roast to come the day before or that morning. Invite the whole group for the official party the day after the roast or in the afternoon when it\u2019s nearly done. Again: may not be feasible, but I thought I\u2019d throw the idea out there.", "This sounds like such a good party!\n\nMy spouse\u2019s parents raised him and his brother on a hilly acreage in BC, and used to have a pitch\u2019n\u2019 putt golf tourney each autumn for all their folk\u2014mostly friends, as they were from back east. There was always whole salmon on planks, with cooking supervised by some friends who were Indigenous and helped source the fish from suppliers in their own communities. I\u2019m sorry those days were over by the time I came into the picture. It sounds like your celebration will have a similar vibe. I hope y\u2019all have a wonderful time.", "The Olympic level kind of gymnastics", ">unless a vegan only has meat eating options for meat eaters\n\nEh, I don't know about this one. Context matters (thinking of that aita for not going to my SILs all vegan Thanksgiving dinner where they're not allowed to bring sides situation) and if it's just a normal dinner party or something, meat eaters can totally enjoy an animal product free dinner. This visceral reaction meat eaters have to the mere idea of eating vegan is silly, and vegan food has gotten pretty damn good. Unless you're on a carnivore diet or something and can't eat anything but meat, it's silly to compare the two (in most situations) IMO.\n\nI'm a full blown meat eater, too. It's not the same, omnivores can enjoy everything, while herbivores are much more limited. Accommodating one means more than accommodating the other.", "It\u2019s definitely more of a spectacle than smoking a brisket is, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s super cool lol", "Out of curiosity, how do you get your meat in a non-violent way? I always assumed that the animal needed to be killed to be eaten.", "Facts.", "But if you go to a vegan's house and eat plants, you aren't being forced to follow someone else's ethics, since you presumably have no objection to the killing and consuming of plants.", "That's not how supply and demand works.", "I made an edit.

They don't have to go see it. It'll be probably sliced outside and brought to the serving table sliced, or placed directly on the plates of those who want it and have walked outside to get it (depending on how they are doing their meal service). Which is most likely LESS traumatising than seeing a turkey being carved at the table.", "You're missing the point. To a vegan, yes, it's violent. But to someone who eats animals as part of their diet, it's just a way of preparing food. If someone who is vegan does not want to be around that, they can make their own choice not to. The world is violent, that's called life.", "I LOVE pig roasts, and for a while we roasted a pig every weekend. But it took a while to get used to the sight of it to be honest. \n\nI\u2019d cook it and carve it somewhere that was easily out of sight and call it good.", "Spit", "Solid idea. When we roast a pig we\u2019ll let everyone know what time it will most likely be done, but everyone is welcome to come and hang out all day while it\u2019s cooking", "I've been to a couple of pig roasts. No offense to people who love them, I know it's something a lot of cultures do, but I think roast pork tastes better prepared a different way, and yeah, seeing the pig on a platter with the head still attached while people carve slices off the side is not something I personally like. But I also realize the hypocrisy in that, because cut that little pig into chops and I'm all over it. There really is no difference, morally. If this was what someone was going to do for Christmas dinner, if I didn't want to go, I'd decline the invitation. If I was willing to put aside my squeamishness and go, I'd go. What I wouldn't do - and what the vegans in question aren't doing - is demand they don't do it at all.\n\nFor me it's like drinking. I don't drink. I don't care if other people do, it's just something I choose not to do. But my choice doesn't give me the right to dictate that, hey, there's no alcohol allowed here. People know I don't drink. If they don't provide a non-alcoholic choice that's fine, I can drink tap water. I don't expect other people to cater to my choices.", "Can doesn't mean much. Vegans mostly eat vegan by choice. Meat eaters eat meat by choice. They're both a choice so you can't force one on the other. They're not much different in terms of choice. You can be respectful by accommodating both.", "I also have no objection to the killing and consuming of animals, and if the vegan doesn't allow that, they're forcing me to follow their ethics.", "Supply and demand has little to do with dietary choices in the USA, in fact.  Look, if you want to eat wheat germ and tofu, I'll respect that if I'm in your home and try my best to choke down wheat germ and tofu.  On the other hand, if you come to my house for dinner, I'm gonna serve steak or chicken or pork.  If I know you are a Vegan, I'll have options for you.

If you don't want to look at dead cow, decline my invitation.", "You\u2019re absolutely fine with your plan even if it was a suburban yard lol - this makes it even less of a concern! Just let folks know that\u2019s your plan and you\u2019re cooking it out of eyeshot from the home. I would enjoy the taste and smell thoroughly especially without the risk of stomach churns seeing its face. Like that\u2019s too visceral an image for me and anyone that\u2019s made uncomfortable has plenty of room to avoid it and there\u2019s enough space it won\u2019t be the de facto entertainment spectacle for everyone else. Win win", "Yeah, I just commented again, but I think a barrier would be good. The easiest one I can think of is a car to block the view. If you are flexible on the location in your yard, you could pick the side of the house where there are less windows and people are less likely to be hanging out. If you have a movable swing set, you could throw a tarp over that as a visual barrier. If it was just adults, I would say close the blinds on the windows and tell them not to go out back if they don\u2019t want to see it. But kids will forget and run out the back door and then they\u2019ll be crying and it will be a whole thing."]}
