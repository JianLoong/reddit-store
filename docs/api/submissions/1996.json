I would personally have it out of view if possible, even non-vegans don't necessarily want to see a dead pig.

If you want enough pork for this size of crowd and you have even a generously sized kitchen, you pretty much have to do a pit, a spit, or a drum. The entertainment value is a mere side effect.\n\nAnd it\u2019s good for us omnivores to at least sometimes handle our meat while it still looks like what it is, an actual animal. Buying nice little plastic-wrapped bits is a way of sanitizing and hiding the process. It seems disrespectful and weirdly unhealthy to be always hiding from the reality of what we are and do. (Recently, my teens and I bought pumpkins from a neighbour\u2019s patch that is cleared each fall by porkers they will eventually serve up in their barbecue truck. As soon as pumpkin time is over, the pigs are turned out in that field to eat the unsold pumpkins and fertilize everything. We love them, they\u2019re beautiful and happy and healthy and that\u2019s how they live. In a few weeks or months, we\u2019ll get some hella good pulled pork. We don\u2019t have the land to keep our own pigs, though we raised poultry when we had the space, and my godmother raised meat rabbits.)\n\n\nVegans can choose to cope or not attend. They\u2019re being accommodated with food they can enjoy, and the ability to not be part of the backyard activities. If they feel it\u2019s all murder\u2014well, this pig is no more a victim than any of the animals served at past dinners elsewhere. If they can\u2019t bear it, they should at least be consistent and not attend other events where meat is shared.", "That\u2019s not true, it\u2019s not about entertainment it\u2019s about the taste of the animal. Meat tastes differently depending on the cut and how it\u2019s cooked. An outdoor roast has a unique taste and by cooking the animal while you\u2019re getting more tasty fat into different parts of the animal. It\u2019s no more a spectacle than smoking a brisket is, you\u2019re getting the most tasty food by cooking it this way.", "Eating meat is not glorifying violence against animals ffs. We are omnivores. We are literally designed to eat meat as well as vegetables. Stop comparing eating meat to dog fighting.", "I was vegetarian for 20 years and vegan for like half of that time, and I\u2019m getting second hand embarrassed over here. A pig roast is not entertainment, it\u2019s a way to cook food. \n\nFucking embarrassing. \n\nI think that eating soy-based products, grown on land that used to be the Amazon rain forest until giant American corporations snatched it up, is, depending on the pig that they bought (how it was raised; how it died) a far bigger detriment to animal welfare and biodiversity. Unless of course the only violence agains non-human life that matters is violence against domesticated animal species.\n\nRegardless, the roast is not a show, again, it is a method of cooking. Should they get rid of the grill and the oven, lest that be a provocative show, too?", "A pig roast is an awesome thing, it is not entertainment, it is the host saying, I love you guys, come, eat, drink and enjoy.", "I have an ethical objection to mass farming and soil erosion. Does that count?", "I have a sincere ethical objection to being forced to follow someone else's ethics.", "I absolutely do.  It deprives rabbits and deer of much needed nutrition.", "I would go hungry because of allergies", "Both these takes are valid and have kernels of truth but are just on the more extreme ends of the spectrum- yours and the person you commented in response to. You should both consider how op is handling this as the best way to mediate these points in a respectful and decent way. \n\nI\u2019m not vegan and love a good roast but honestly I would be uncomfortable and disturbed at the idea of a whole pig spit roasted as being a form of entertainment and as a prominent display at my family gathering for a holiday. I have vegan friends that wouldn\u2019t consider it as graphic or disturbing as I would. I totally get op\u2019s perspective too about it being a method of preparation that\u2019s been on the bucket list for a while and this is the perfect opportunity. A whole entire spit roasted pig being cooked over a hand dug pit in a suburban yard is very much out of the norm and unexpected- it\u2019s fair to give people a heads up rather than blindside therm. \n\nAnd While my squeamishness is my issue and concern, I would still hope that my family member host that has taken on the obligation of hosting a yearly large Christmas gathering for our family members would have my feelings in mind at least some .  Idk how much smoke this is going to generate but that would also concern me and potentially trigger my asthma - I would again hope a family member would consider and maybe t try and mitigate something like that causing me distress or harm.\n\nOp\u2019s comments hit upon the idea of constructing a barrier of sorts to visually block what might be disturbing or difficult for some guests but still allows for op to cook and serve it. That\u2019s a much better approach than either walking on imaginary eggshells and bending over backwards to cater to the potential of offense you aren\u2019t even sure would come to fruition as well as your take which is that\u2019s the person that feels uncomfortable\u2019s problem and you will do nothing and show no concern and they should just stay home.", "> It's not violent, it's food. \n\nTo the vegans, it's a representation of actual violence that happened against the pig. \n\n>It is normal to eat food and this is simply a way of preparing a type of food.\n\nA particularly graphic way that glorifies violence against animals.\n\n>If it will be too much, they have the choice not to put themselves in the situation.\n\nI agree 100%.", "That honestly sounds like the other people are the problem- her not complaining to you is an active choice.

Even if you could just do it on the side of the house and block the view with a car or something. \n\nLike, I would still be totally game for it and would enthusiastically eat the meat.

There was always whole salmon on planks, with cooking supervised by some friends who were Indigenous and helped source the fish from suppliers in their own communities.

Context matters (thinking of that aita for not going to my SILs all vegan Thanksgiving dinner where they're not allowed to bring sides situation) and if it's just a normal dinner party or something, meat eaters can totally enjoy an animal product free dinner. This visceral reaction meat eaters have to the mere idea of eating vegan is silly, and vegan food has gotten pretty damn good. Unless you're on a carnivore diet or something and can't eat anything but meat, it's silly to compare the two (in most situations) IMO.\n\nI'm a full blown meat eater, too.

No offense to people who love them, I know it's something a lot of cultures do, but I think roast pork tastes better prepared a different way, and yeah, seeing the pig on a platter with the head still attached while people carve slices off the side is not something I personally like.

Obnoxious, but aren't we all?\n\nAnd on the other side I have encountered people who would deliberately sneak meat allergens into the food of my friend who is allergic.\n\nSay what you will about the obnoxious coworker, but at least he never tried to murder or maim someone I cared about in the name of proving a point about veganism.", "Exactly. \nThey're free to make a polite request, or to politely decline the invitation. \nIt 8s good hosting to make guests feel welcome, but that should be limited to steps to work around, not simply rule out.", "Well since they're not roasting the pig in the middle of the living room they can stay away from it in the backyard and be fucking fine. \n\nThis is a ridiculous take.", "A shrimp cocktail perhaps", "I think it helps to look at a form of violence against animals that was once common and accepted for a long time but now abhorred, to keep in mind when examining another form of violence against animals that has been long accepted.", "That would be about 50+ people 2 days in a row. So no", "Lol why should three people be able to take Christmas ham away from the rest of the party? There will be vegan options for the vegans, which is more than the vegans do for non vegans when they host. Insisting that everyone else have a shittier meal so as not to hurt their delicate sensibilities is why so many people hate vegans.", "Lol", "Same", "Not really comparable. One is deadly violence for sport, the other is eating food.", "This isn't a kind thing to do. You're aware of that. You have the right to serve what you want at your house. It's really up to you.", "I agree 100%. That said, if they want to be nice hosts and want the uncle to come and be comfortable, they could just choose one of a thousand other movies.", "I'm not comparing veganism with PTSD. I'm drawing a comparison between someone having a sensitivity to one thing that brings up images of violence against other individuals in their mind, with someone else having a sensitivity that brings up images of a different type of violence against other individuals in their mind.", "I'm not talking about dietary differences.", "Some do, some don't. Some just aren't as desensitized to violence against animals like a lot of us are, so witnessing said violence can lead to trauma.", "I mean, is it not human nature to be more repulsed the more graphic the violence?", "Each pound of beef that you eat required up to 10 pounds of plant matter to grow. Meat eaters end up enabling production of far more plants than plant eaters, counter intuitive as it might seem.", "OP already is. OP is cooking the pig out back on a 7 acre property. If 7 acres isn\u2019t enough space for the vegan family members to not see the pig then at that point they\u2019re simply just being difficult for the sake of it. You\u2019ve been up and down this thread with your \u201chot takes\u201d and frankly it\u2019s just a bit ridiculous at this point. I\u2019ve seen your post history so I\u2019m not surprised you\u2019re making these kinds of comments but seriously please get a reality check and grow up a bit before you engage in adult conversations.", "Alright.\nThey have a vegan aunt invited to a Christmas gathering sensitive to the idea of cooking a whole pig, she can object to the idea and choose to stay away from the pit while it is being cooked.\nI have a veteran uncle who hosts the 4th of July every year he chooses to go up to the house during fireworks as not to trigger his PTSD.", "Uh yeah hi I actually have PTSD and while you may have some point on the slaughterhouse workers possibly having PTSD (I won\u2019t invalidate any workers who may actually have it by saying they don\u2019t), your other \u201cpoint\u201d is absolute rubbish. To compare having PTSD to being vegan and seeing an already dead pig being cooked in the backyard is just so insanely insensitive and rude to people who actually have PTSD. Its not like they\u2019re slaughtering the pig in front of the entire family or anything. They\u2019re simply cooking a whole pig that\u2019s come prepared for cooking. And the few family members who are vegan don\u2019t even have to see the pig whole if they don\u2019t want to, they just don\u2019t have to go in the backyard while it\u2019s back there. Given how much space OP says they have, it sounds like they\u2019d have plenty of room to not see the pig. Now if they choose to go see it and then get upset that\u2019s their own problem, not OP\u2019s.", "Anything beyond dietary preferences is entitlement . They don\u2019t have to go to their house for thanksgiving.", "And that's my point. It's partly a show.", "I literally said in my previous comment that I agreed they could choose to not go.", "I understand the setting, but is the pig meat being showcased in the same way?", "Fair enough.", "There are people that have witnessed violence against nonhuman individuals, and this has caused them trauma.", ">They don\u2019t have to go to their house for thanksgiving.\n\nI agree 100%", "I mean, I don't see how someone would even go about preventing you from having an objection to that.", "Showcased is a weird way to put it, cooking over a spit is just a cooking method not an art show.", "And all this so called violence that you\u2019re referencing is not occurring at the family get together so again your whole nonsense rant is just that. Nonsense. It doesn\u2019t apply here. Sure you could argue that those who work in a slaughterhouse could develop PTSD. But to even attempt to argue that seeing an already dead and prepared pig being cooked, even whole, would somehow induce enough trauma to cause PTSD is absurd. Again I will say grow up and come back when you\u2019re ready to actually participate in adult conversations.", "This! I think it\u2019s far too easy for people who eat plastic-wrapped hunks of non-specific muscle to put distance between themselves and the whole process of getting that meat onto their plate.", "It's typically more of a spectacle that other cooking methods.", "Animal-cruelty induced trauma is a real thing. Some people are triggered by things that remind them of the cruelty they witnessed. It's not unfathomable that seeing the charred body of a pig that likely did not want to be killed, presented in the format typical of a pig roast, could cause someone to relive moments that caused their trauma.", "No more so than a BBQ and a digging pit implies it will be away from the house because you know fire so seems pretty not spectacley."]}
