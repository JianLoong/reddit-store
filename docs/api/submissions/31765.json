Legitimate alarm bells went off in your head and I hope they continue to ring loudly. No one should require your infant's SSN for any reason, outside of you and your child's mother and only then for legit purposes.  \n\nIf I were you, I would contact the credit reporting agencies right away and put an alert on her account. Do it privately and don't offer anyone the heads-up. This alert is a notice to lenders to confirm identity before extending credit or opening any account for that person's SSN. It is free and it will stay for at least a year before you can renew it. Set a discrete reminder in your phone to renew this alert annually for the next 18 years. There are three major companies to contact and it takes about three minutes to complete the process. This is something you can do that will give you peace of mind, going forward, that regardless of who/why someone wants her SSN, they can do nothing that would harm her future financial wellbeing.", "I am not in the USA but I presume that is something like our \"tax file numbers\" here in Australia so why couldn't they ask you to open an account for your newborn and they can put some money into it. Seems simple enough and that way you can preserve the identification of the SSN. No TA here - just protecting your child's identity.", "Hey, guess what I can do?  I can open a savings account for your son.  I don't even need his SSN, I just need personal integrity and honesty.  Heck, I can put the money into CD's or into something tangible like gold or silver.  \n\nNobody gives out their SSN willy-nilly.

The 2nd red flag is their anger when you questioned why. They simply could have asked you to set up the savings account and then requested that account number so they can make deposits. Their reaction makes it sound shady af.

There is a principle in security that you can't make exceptions for people just because you trust them.  And it is inappropriate, and impossible, to apply that to everything, or even most things, in life, but your children's banking information is one of the places it is.\n\nWhat your sister wanted to do was lovely.  But you have to make a blanket rule of \"don't give out SSN to anybody without a reason and a paper trail\" (\"thank you for calling such and such this is a recorded line\" is a good enough paper trail for me, but that is what I mean.)  And not have exceptions.\n\nI would have gone n a h if your sister didn't blow up and get offended.  Her initial request was ill-advised but not asshole; blowing up because of it... not so good.", "NTA. Yeah, the savings account is a nice gift but there's no reason they had to make it a big secret. An SSN is too hackable to give it up without a reason.", "NTA- You do not give away SSN numbers, so good on you for sticking to your guns and saying no. That is dangerous. They didn't reveal their true intentions right away, and even then, I wonder if their excuse is true.", "NTA. Worked at a bank. A SSN was required to open up an account in the child\u2019s name with an adult as the authorized signer until the child was 18. A SSN was also required to set up someone as a POD on an account. Let\u2019s not get into the fun in opening an account where the clerk of court was technically the guardian of the account until they were 18.", "NTA. I actually have all of my cousin's children's SSNs because I used to get savings bonds for their kids until the government made it impossible to do that. But for a savings account? No. There is no reason for you to give her your daughter's SSN.", "Nta. They don't need it. If they want to help you save for your daughter, you can open an account in her name and give them the details to pay into. Or they can write a cheque in her name.", "NTA. With her SS# they can open credit cards, take out loans, even try to get food stamps and WIC in her name. Under no circumstances should you EVER give out this number. Tell them if they want to do something special to use their own #. They can easily buy savings bonds, open a 529 or savings acct with their own ss# and have her as the beneficiary.\n\nAnyone who is pushy for info like this is up to no good. I have known two people who were the victim of identity theft by relatives and it always comes down to, \"Are the parents/victim willing to prosecute or not?\" If not, they are stuck with bad credit and on the hook for the money. If so, a relative will go to jail.", "NTA. They could\u2019ve easily just told you.", "NTA, a way for them to not be creepy about asking is to not ask and just buy savings bonds like a normal person. Also, there\u2019s no way a bank would open an account for a person if the only personal information someone had was a SSN written down or on their phone. \u201cIt\u2019s for my niece\u201d sounds really scammy.", "INFO: This is so vague\u2026 hard to tell what\u2019s going on.

Do you all talk to each other? What did they say when you asked?", "NTA. They can contribute to a bank account for your child without a Social Security number - you (the parent) just go in to the bank and arrange it.  \n\nSocial Security numbers NEED to be kept private! There are too many cases where a relative has used a child's social security number to take out loans, put the child in debt and ruined the child's credit rating - which keeps the child from getting scholarships, etc. Do not give that number out! \n\nTell them you will talk to the bank and set the account up, they can donate if they wish. The harder they push to get your child's SS number, the more suspicious you should be.", "NTA. SSN is personal information that is not to given out to every family member that asks. It can be used to make fraudulent purchases and sticking the child with the resulting debt and thereby tanking their credit score and future. Possibly even for life.\n\nI don't know which part of the world you live in and can't guide you through the legalities. But if they need the childs SSN at the bank for the savings account, then you can go as the legal guardian and inform the bank.", "NTA\u2026I get where they are coming from.  Growing up, this was the norm for families.  But with so much identity theft, not a great idea.  But you are saying you don\u2019t trust your sister.  That is what your sister is upset about.  What I would do is open account yourself.  Let them know where you did this and if anyone wants to make a deposit, they are welcome to do so.", "NTA, and you should look into freezing your childs credit reports so nobody can open accounts or lines of credit in their names.  Lots of stories of kids finding out family members have opened credit cards, etc.", "NTA and never give out the Social Security number to anyone you don\u2019t trust or who does not have a really good reason to have it say your spouses employer, or your employer for health insurance. The only people besides myself and my husband, who have access to our kids Social Security numbers are my parent because they have set up some financial accounts that needed the Social Security number. And we were happy to give it to my parents because we trust us 100%. But otherwise if you ask me for my Social Security number you\u2019re not getting it.", "Is this the other side of a post a few days back on exactly the same situation from the aunt's perspective?", "They can open the account in their name and have her listed as the beneficiary. NTA. don\u2019t give it out.", "DO NOT GIVE OUT YOUR CHILD'S SS # TO ANYONE BUT THE IRS. \n\nToo many kids have grown up to find their financial lives already ruined by someone who stole their SS number when they were small children.  They can't get credit or loans for education. It's tragic.\n\nNTA", "They might have been buying an EE bond. They need a SSN for that but I think it can be the buyer if they register as the owner. The child can be the beneficiary.", "NTA - Years ago in the US you could get savings bonds to give as gifts without the SS number of the recipient, but it would have the buyers SS number.  My husband and I always gave them to kids in the family  (nieces and nephews) so they could save for the future.\n\nLittle did we know that one of the parents took our SS number (and this is a relative) and used it to open accounts in our names.  Running up bills and we had no clue until we started getting collection calls.\n\nThis ended our giving of Savings Bonds to the kids, unfortunately for them.\n\nBTW - we made them call the companies and fess up or we were going to have them arrested.  Doesn't matter relative or not, this was our financial future being destroyed and the end of our relationship with them.", "Don\u2019t do it they can fuck up your babies credit with that", "NTA. You did right.  They were being suspicious and I could just picture your daughter getting thousands in credit card bills for her first birthday.", "Dude, NTA.  If they want to give her money, open a 539 education account.  Lots of places allow for a code for family to donate to the 529 without having to know the child's SSN or even the account number.  \n\nWith the new laws going into effect this Jan. 1st, you can even fund her Roth IRA with the funds if they are not all used.  \n\nThere is NO reason they need it.", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA. Keep that number under lock and key for your child. Aside from the parents (and maybe doctors/hospitals), NO ONE needs that information. It was creepy enough that they made such a production out of telling you why. And now they are angry? They seriously need to get over themselves.

NTA", "NTA. NOT AT ALL. If they had a legitimate reason, they could have told you. Even if they really opened the account (I feel doubtful) you could have provided the SSN separately. Your relatives have no good reason to have her SSN.", "Absolutley not! None of their business. There are ways to start accounts without that number.", "FYI this whole argument is due to generational differences.\n\nWhen your relatives were younger, there was no need to keep the SSN secret. A SSN used to be required to do things like open accounts for children or savings bonds for kids, which was again a culturally accepted gift. The SSN used to be a unique identifier that was not private. University's, schools, organizations would even use the SSN as a public identifier on ID cards or on school papers.\n\nNow that has changed, the SSN is both used as a unique identifier and a private code which is inherently problematic. Anyways, no one here was trying to scam anyone, just a misunderstanding.", "NTA, but we did have to give our son\u2019s social to my in laws to open the 529, so they really can\u2019t do it without.", "NTA- if they want to do something like that, they should talk to you first.", "NTA. SSN's need to be guarded, it's the most needed piece of info for identity theft. They really have no business knowing it & definitely no business asking for it. There is nothing they can do for the child that would require them to have the child's SSN.", "My suggestion is to say you will go the the bank and give it to the bank but you aren't giving it out.", "Exactly.  \n\nIf they want to donate money to her in some sort of account, OP can open  529 account for daughter.  There is no limit on how much relatives can donate to a 529, even if they are not the owner.\n\nMy kids' 529 accounts have a code that isn't the SSN or the account number that I can give out, and people can donate to.", "Yep, exactly.  More specifically, the social security number is for social security - the American government social safety net, disability support, pension, medical support.  Yes, that does actually exist here; it is just woefully inadequate.  But it is also used as a tax identification number, and, because banks report money held to the government for tax purposes, they generally want it, too.  There are ways around it sometimes; there are banks that will manage their reporting responsibilities using some other method of identification, but it is a pain in the butt and most places won't.", "When my kids were born, relatives set up savings bonds for them using their own SSNs. You don\u2019t need the recipient\u2019s SSN.", "Then they needed to say that and show the paperwork. Otherwise it\u2019s sketchy.", "Unfortunately the scenario was vague. When I requested to know why she wanted the SSN the response was\n\n \"Really? I'm gonna steal her identity and open up a bunch of credits cards.....you can give it to me tomorrow. Why would it matter what I wanted to do with it?\"\n\nSo my guard was up after that. The scenario didn't get any better the following day and everything became even more volatile. We have talked since, they are still vague on what type of account they wanted to setup. I kept getting the \"Savings account\" and when I tried to help them by willing to go to the bank so I can give the banker my daughters information I was dismissed. Their goal was a gift for my daughter but without my knowledge and tried to get my daughters SSN just because it was requested.", "Maybe, if you could find the link that would be great.", "I don't think the intent was that malicious but it still feels like it was the wrong way to go about it.", "And the link is \u2026?", "I'd be interested to see it you can find.

I've never heard of this before", "NTA, but if they do the 529 and want the tax deduction, they have to own the account in some states. We found this out from our accountant, so we opened them for my niece & nephew. We were very clear with their parents about why we needed the info and gave them the option of calling the plan directly with the info.\n\nBeing secretive about it is super shady. You shouldn't give out the SSN unless absolutely necessary and they're old enough to understand that.\n\nAlso, in a regular savings account, they have control over what happens to that money since your kids are minors. I wouldn't like that since you can't rely on them not doing something irresponsible with that money", ">...It's a number assigned at birth here in the states...\n\nIt wasn't always like this.

Open bank account (when both parents work, they put part of each other\u2019s pay into baby account, for baby essentials etc), savings account or both.", "NTA. They should have told you what it was for.", "NTA, 100% full stop", "NTA. My in-laws were able to create a trust that includes my children without any of their SS numbers.", "They can open a savings account without the social. They can do it under their own names. Never trust anyone asking for a SSN for a child.", "NTA.\n\nMy niece and nephews are all my beneficiaries. But I didn't need to get their SSN's for this. If they don't need them for that, what the hell do they need them for?", "NTA.  I will say though, that I setup a separate 529 account for each Grandchild that I contribute to and own.  I have read too many times of 529 accounts being raised by parents when they have financial issues.  I did need my grandchildren\u2019s SSN for this.", "I'm not from the US but the amount of people who were victims of fraud when relatives used their SSN as a baby is high up there. The call center I worked for has a collections team and there have been some sympathetic employees talking bout how they can't comprehend how relatives can sink their babies in that much bad credit.\n\nCan't they open a savings for her without an SSN?", "NTA. You can open up a 529 for your child and they can donate to it. You should not give up your newborn\u2019s SS number to anyone.", "NTA they were unreasonable requesting her SSN in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s extremely thoughtful of them to contribute to a savings account for her. But it should only be through giving the parent the money.", "NTA  \nWho says \"give me your SSN, trust me bro\" and expect everything to continue normal?", "NTA\n\nYour tax preparer if you do not self-file needs your kid's SSN (one of many reasons it's important to use reputable accountants/preparers).  Your sister and stepmother do *not* need it.\n\nGiving that to them is a good way to have a kid's credit ruined before they're even old enough to work.  Child identity theft is almost always committed by a relative of the child.  Even if they wouldn't do this themselves, they clearly don't understand how important it is to be careful with this info, or they wouldn't be demanding it of you.  They are not trustworthy with this info.\n\nShe doesn't need to open a bank account for your daughter herself, if she wants to give to an account in daughter's name it can be one *you* set up and have signatory control over.  She also could donate to a 529 plan you open.  Neither of these require her to know the SSN.\n\nIt's sketchy to me that they just asked and wouldn't even give any reason at the time, though.\n\nYou are *entirely* right not to give her your child's SSN.  This is a hill to die on.\n\nEdit:  I see from your comments that when they finally told you their story about what was up, you *offered* to set up an account they could contribute to and were rebuffed.  Yeah.  This is super, *super* sketchy.  Her little sarcastic \"joke\" about doing fraudulent things in your daughter's name to make your refusal somehow sound unreasonable isn't funny at all.", "NTA. Nor are they.\n\nYes, absolutely you should know about any accounts given in your child's name. In this case that account may fall under the Uniform Gifts to Minor (UGMA) laws, which means interest and dividends in the account could be taxable to your income (talk to a professional to confirm if that is the case or not). And if something were to ever happen to one of these relatives then you need to know about the account, or it becomes one of those abandoned accounts that revert to the Government.   \n\n\nSo yes, protect their SSN, it is a valuable number, obviously. But graciously accept gifts to your child. These can help a great deal when it is time for college, trade school, or to buy a house. 18 years of interest adds up.", "nta", "NTA. Don't let the open a savings account. as her parent, that is your job, and if they want to contribute, they can give you a check for her account.", "you open an account and give them the account number", "That's what I wish happened. You did the right by giving your reason. When I asked for the reason my response I received was everything but a reason.", "I didn't and I won't be. It belongs to my child and until they are old enough to make their own decision no one else will have it.", "Are you even American? No that is not normal we do not give out our SSN to anybody. The fraud is they so can even take out credit cards in the babies names. Of course they talked that was the whole point of this post. JEEZE.", "His sister is the same generation duh", "If they accept your no then NAH. Otherwise NTA \n\nI think your sister already wrote and that was the judgement as well (she said she answered as a joke she planned to steal your daughter identity)  \n\nAs long as they don't insist and you said no because you are uncomfortable with this all is well\n\n\nIf you want open a savings account yourself as a compromise", "Yep!  So many \"children\" disappeared on paper when that requirement for claiming went into place.", "Fuck... that was my sister's post.", "2 of my younger siblings and I got ours when the requirement to provide the child's SSN to claim them on taxes went into place for the 1988 tax year.  We were 1-5 years old.  My youngest brother who was born a little later had his applied for at birth.", "There is a limit to who you can change the name to, though. The plan typically states which family relations it can be.\n\nWe have a 529 for our nephew. It\u2019s specifically under our names because my SIL could not be trusted to withdraw that money for herself - the account owner can typically withdraw for a penalty. She had a conniption when she realized this.", "\ud83d\ude02 thought so", "Yea, it is dictated by federal laws.\n\nSo has to do with degrees of separation.\n\nYou can only give the money to someone within 2 degrees of separation or less.\n\nSo you can give the money to your own education as that is no degree of separation.\n\nYou can use the money for siblings (half or full), a parent or a biological or adopted child, or your currest spouse as that is 1 degree of separation.\n\nThe farthest you can use the money for is the 2nd degree relations.  These are grandparents, parents' siblings, parents' current spouses, siblings' current spouses, current spouses' children (stepkids), siblings' bio or adopted children, childrens' current spouses, childrens' bio or adopted children and childrens' biological parent (in cases of divorce, sometimes one spouse is required to pay for an education of the other spouse and this can be used if there are children from the marriage).  \n\nI just realized how complicated it sounds.  I guess I just do this a lot because I only made one account and change the name as needed.  I have had to explain to the institutions how I am related to whoever, and so I CAN pay for a semester of school for them...", "A few on here assumed but that was something I never talked about. Her response to me was\n\n\"Really? I'm gonna steal her identity and open up a bunch of credits cards.....you can give it to me tomorrow. Why would it matter what I wanted to do with it?\"", "She said as much in her post and to be frank I don't find it amusing personally nor do I think something so important should be treated so flippantly as she did -'why would it matter...' \n\nHer intentions were good delivery sucks imo", "Yeah, if one has a passport, the passport covers both identity and eligibility for work.\n\nSS card covers only eligibility for work, and must be paired with something like a state-issued id or driver's license.  And yep, a birth certificate counts here for employment authorization.  Even with a name change if it clearly reasonably relates to your current name it's valid without necessarily needing to provide something like a marriage license.  I'm in the habit of providing them together because of how often that *is* required to establish the link to my current legal name, but yeah the I9 doesn't even require that - they just have to make a note about the discrepancy.\n\nHeck, the receipt for the new SS card is acceptable for a temporary period!  They're supposed to give you that period (if you provide that receipt) precisely *because* cards get lost or stolen but people still need to work.", "Oh crap, thanks for the reminder.  I got a RealID at the DMV the other day and hadn't yet pulled my social security card back out of my wallet."]}
