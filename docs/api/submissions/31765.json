Asking for someone\u2019s SSN and just saying \u201ctrust me\u201d is a sketchy thing to do.", "NTA. You should never give the number to anyone who is the kids parent. If your sister wants to open s savings account, let her do it in her name. Or let her give you the money to do it. \n\nNo one should ever be asking you for that information no matter who they are. And when they get angry for you saying no, that\u2019s an even bigger red flag.", "NTA.  There is no reason they need her SSN unless you are already dead and they become her guardian.  They will never need her SSN.  They can open a savings account without her just like you can.  Protect your child.", "INFO - besides being a nuclear sub, what is SSN?", "You made the right call to not give your new born's SSN to your sister and stepmother as they did not explain reason for needing it.\n\nNTA", "Nta, never give out that information. While your sister may not have had alternative motives for the SSN, since she wouldn't tell you what it was before originally I would have been skeptical too. You are right to protect that information too many people abuse the ssn of children.\n\nAny savings or checking account should be open to the parents and you can possibly allow other people to have deposit privileges but not withdrawal privileges, or even know the balance.", "NTA-They don\u2019t need it to do things for your daughter like start an education fund. The fact that they were willing to tag team you for it after you made a reasonable request for a one on one conversation is suspicious.", "NO NO NO never give up anyone\u2019s social, with that and birthday a lot of things can be done like opening up a line of credit (not saying that\u2019s what they were going to do, BUT it can be done)\u2026 if they truly want to help out,YOU could open an account in baby\u2019s name and GIVE them account number only.  They can deposit money anytime they want and you still have total control of it.", "NTA don't do it. They could have told you directly what their plans are but sending the men out of the room and demanding a 1 on 1? Sketchy as fuck. My initial thought was they they are trying to use that number for some kind of fraught etc", "The sister posted an AITA about this a few days ago,  said the real reason OP was mad was because he wouldn't have access to the money", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Legitimate alarm bells went off in your head and I hope they continue to ring loudly. No one should require your infant's SSN for any reason, outside of you and your child's mother and only then for legit purposes.  \n\nIf I were you, I would contact the credit reporting agencies right away and put an alert on her account. Do it privately and don't offer anyone the heads-up. This alert is a notice to lenders to confirm identity before extending credit or opening any account for that person's SSN. It is free and it will stay for at least a year before you can renew it. Set a discrete reminder in your phone to renew this alert annually for the next 18 years. There are three major companies to contact and it takes about three minutes to complete the process. This is something you can do that will give you peace of mind, going forward, that regardless of who/why someone wants her SSN, they can do nothing that would harm her future financial wellbeing.", "I am not in the USA but I presume that is something like our \"tax file numbers\" here in Australia so why couldn't they ask you to open an account for your newborn and they can put some money into it. Seems simple enough and that way you can preserve the identification of the SSN. No TA here - just protecting your child's identity.", "Hey, guess what I can do?  I can open a savings account for your son.  I don't even need his SSN, I just need personal integrity and honesty.  Heck, I can put the money into CD's or into something tangible like gold or silver.  \n\nNobody gives out their SSN willy-nilly.  That is about as stupid as their explanation.  \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIf she truly wanted to help, she should have been willing to explain why she needed the SSN.\n\nThere are a lot of ways that someone can give future financial support to a child.  And there are very few people whom you should trust with your child's private information.  \n\nTell Sis you're going to set up a 529 (or equivalent if you aren't in the US) and she's welcome to send a donation to the one you set up so all funds are in one account.", "They probably needed it if they were planning to open at 529 college savings account. \n\nI think you might also need it for a savings bond? But not sure those are so popular anymore.", "Social security number. It's a number assigned at birth here in the states for credit and identification.", "btw can i have your SSN? i was gonna open a savings account for you. Trust me bro", "Yeah there is no reason to give it to them\u2026 you need to keep an eye and make sure no one opens a credit under her social security", "Do they give you a card or something?", "Lol", "Or claims her as a dependent on their taxes.\n\nNo one should have OPs child's SSN. Personally, I wouldn't give it to anyone even after knowing their reasons.", "Yup, a paper one that is voided if laminated\u2026", "its gonna work one day, just watch"]}
