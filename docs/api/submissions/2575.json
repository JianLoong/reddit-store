Your toddler is also very likely to accidentally hurt the puppy if left unsupervised.", "NTA.  I love dogs. I grew up with dogs and have dogs as an adult. A puppy can't control themselves and is unaware of their strengths or another's weakness. It is so irresponsible to leave a toddler alone with puppy.

Neither of these are great at regulating their actions and act impulsively.  \nIt only takes a second for the 4 year old to accidently step on puppy's paw then for pup to instinctively nip at what just stepped on it. Neither makes either bad, it is just what can happen. Keeping them separated while they are alone (and still very young) is a smart move.", "NTA.  Potential for aggression aside, bouncy and energetic dogs sometimes don't know their own strength or size.  They can easily hurt a child without intention.  It's just smart to not have unsupervised moments at those ages.", "NTA. Never, EVER, leave kids and any animals alone. The puppy is 8 months old! You've barely had time to train it yet! You have no idea how it's going to react to being provoked. Hell, what if they get overexcited, it jumps at your kid and your kid cracks their head on the coffee table?

The actual fact is, this is best for literally everyone in the equation *except* for your husband's weird connection between his dog and his ego. Because:\n\n1. It's safer for the dog, because toddlers don't know how to behave appropriately around animals and could pull his tail, upset him, etc. And this eliminates the risk of if something *did* happen, the dog might have to be rehomed or even put down. It's safer and better for the dog.\n2. It's safer for the toddler. Because *even if* the dog *intends* to be gentle and kind, he could still hurt the toddler!

Toddlers are unpredictable and it only takes one bite to put your dog on the euthanasia table- an ending that is entirely avoidable with responsible care. \nOther note- your puppy is a BABY and needs structured alone time to both decompress, and learn how to self soothe.

Dogs and babies are both unpredictable and that can occasionally lead to trouble. Why take the risk when it's as simple as putting a gate up. Let me tell you a story. I adopted a 5 year old dog. He was the sweetest boy, great around kids, our cats.. just the sweetest boy ever. A few happy years down the line and he is 12. Without warning one day he attacks one of the cats he has lived with lovingly for 6 years. Tore into her and she had to immediately be put down. Turned out the dog had cancer, there were no symptoms yet but we got a vet workup on him because of the drastic incident. Sick animals can sometimes act very unpredictably. There are cases where dogs have attacked babies because their cooing or crying sounds like a squeaky toy which amps up their prey drive. Have a small dog? In the UK this year a chihuahua killed a 2 week old baby. I adore dogs. Would likely never in my life be without a dog, but I would never leave a baby alone with ANY dog. Probably nothing would happen, but it's your baby, why take the chance.", "NTA.  Seriously question someone's judgment who thinks cats are more likely to kill than dogs.  Unless he is comparing your child to a bug, he is wrong.  Your dog is a puppy still and more likely to make mistakes, mistaking something in a child's hand for food or a toy, mistaking a kid maneuver as being threatening, or reacts to a pain response, and let's be honest, kids can be extremely cruel to pets because they are learning too.  Only way to make sure one of those mistakes do not end up poorly is to separate them when they can't be monitored.  Give him this, \"my car never hurt anyone, but I am not going to leave my 4 year-old inside by themself hoping they don't find the brake release on a hill, figure out how to roll up the window on their fingers, or fall out the door.\"  That's just about an inanimate object.

I don't have kids, and I have a little 15-lbs beagle mix, and even though I know he's the friendliest, least-bitey dog I've ever met, I still wouldn't leave him alone with a toddler or baby. Too much can go wrong. The kid doesn't intrinsically know dog body language, and the dog doesn't necessarily have the same tolerance with a child that it does with an adult. We don't even need to go straight to the \"worst\" hypothetical of a dog suddenly snapping. Kids can unknowingly hurt dogs, dogs can play too rough or knock over a child.

Everyone in my generation spent multiple hours a day without adult supervision when we were 4. People can start kindergarten at 4. They can be alone for an hour.", "Right? Who the hell has little kids and has an hour to shower?? Wait til your husband gets home if you need that much time to pamper yourself.", "Most dogs will show discomfort before they attack, and/or the situation will cue parents to intervene based on common sense and their general knowledge of their dog's boundaries.\n\nThe problem with leaving a toddler alone with the dog is the toddler doesn't always know how to behave around the dog or when the dog is signalling to stop. \n\nSo the issue isn't \"dog becomes randomly violent\", it's more \"the warning signs to dog becoming violent are missed\".", "You made me laugh so hard! I love this!", "You sound like me with my first child.  She could be left alone , watching her favorite show for an hour. All would be fine.  I could give her a snack and take a nap if I wanted.  She wouldn't go anywhere without permission. \n\nThen my son came.  He couldn't be alone for 15 minutes, or I would have one dozen eggs thrown at my wall. Stairs decorated with potato chips, coffee in the sink.  That doesn't even include his Houdini like abilities to get out of the house.\n\nKids aren't built the same.", "Ah yes, the usual low-effort comment to invalidate another user's judgment.  \n\nI have 2 children and know exactly what a 4yo can get up to when completely unsupervised at home for an hour.

I'm invalidating what you said because it's silly. 4 is old enough to start learning independence.\n\nOkay, you want to be a helicopter mom. Great. Just know that in a couple of decades when you are wondering why your children aren't motivated to do anything on their own that this is where it started.", "I do agree that judging a person without knowing them and their child is wrong. \n\n\nSome kids can be left alone.  Some need to be chained to you.", "NTA - puppies and babies are not needed to be together 24/7 that being said. Don\u2019t neglect training the puppy and also teaching it that the child is nothing to ignore it. Separating is best when you can\u2019t supervise as they should ALWAYS be supervised. A lot can go wrong with a baby and a dog alone.", "NTA\n\nI grew up with a dog, I have one now as an adult (she's currently lying on me as I type this, as a matter of fact). I LOVE dogs.\n\nBut toddlers don't always understand when they're doing something the dog doesn't like, and even well trained dogs can snap if goaded enough. You're watching out for your toddler's safety.", "NTA - I won\u2019t even let two of my dogs along with my small 8lb blind dog because I\u2019m afraid of them hurting her.  They are dogs! Baby pulls on ear or tail, hits the dog possibly with something; dog reacts badly. It only takes one time for a tragedy to occur. You can probably google articles of a dog suddenly attacking a child .", "You are completely right. They are animals and can and have had moments where they act differently than they have. If the dog is comfortable and not in a dangerous situation then it's complete fine. It's not neglect unless it's days on end. But for an hour or 2 it's fine...if he has a problem with it then let him watch toddler while you shower.", "NTA, he's stupid. Literally stupid. Even a pup can accidentally injure a toddler very badly, and the reverse is also true.

The husky has never put a paw wrong and is in obedience training and is \u2018silver\u2019 level. She has the best temperament with my boy lets him play with her toys, generally ignores him if he is crawling and will leave the room if he is too much. It\u2019s amazing. But guess what? If I\u2019m leaving the room you bet I\u2019m separating them BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER KNOW 100% and I do not want to put my dog in that position where she might get scared or hurt and have an accident where she hurts my boy. That\u2019s just being responsible. I\u2019ll run to the kitchen put the kettle on things like that but if I\u2019m leaving the room for more than a minute I call the dog give her a treat and shut the baby gate!", "I just want to say, when I was a child my parent and her boyfriend got into a fight and I was left alone with the dog and was bitten in the face....you are not over reacting.

You\u2019re being a responsible parent and pet owner\u2014you\u2019re doing the best thing for both your child and your dog.

She has never so much as growled in her life. She loves on my toddler and puts up with so much shit from her but it will be a cold day in hell before I leave them alone together. \n\nSo many things can trigger a dog - pain, anxiety, being frightened.

One playful nip and the baby looses an eye.. your DH is being reckless.", "And on top of that, puppies are still learning how to control themselves when they play.

I\u2019m assuming it is a toy breed. The kid is more likely to accidentally kill the puppy by picking it up and dropping it or something", "Oh my gosh when my dog was a puppy she gnawed at our sleeves and pants and play bit like crazy until we had her properly trained. Puppy teeth are no joke. And with baby skin that\u2019s just asking for trouble! NTA.", "And depending on breed/size of puppy a 4 year old could hurt the dog in play.
