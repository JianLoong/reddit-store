Some people get bogged down in making everything for twins equal. One had more total items, and the other had more cost. Which does make it equal honestly, but even if they cost exactly the same or Nina got less of both, it wouldn't matter. They both got items that they like and will enjoy.", "NTA. Your sister should be thanking you for getting her girls such thoughtful gifts. She should NOT be counting every little crayon or brush. Makes her sound like Harry Potter's dim cousin Dudley.", "NTA, different gift for different kids, guessing your sister still wants them to be \"twins\"", "NTA, but for moms next birthday but a bag of jelly beans and wrap each one individually. After all, it's not the content that counts but simply the number of gifts. She will be so happy!", "NTa", "Not a twin, but my brother liked expensive video games and consoles while I wanted books. I would get tons more presents no than him because my dad spent an equaliish amount on us. \n\nMy brother asked my dad one time why I got so much more and he said \u201cThat book costs 5 dollars. One game costs 30.\u201d  My brother never said anything about it again.", "Twin here. My sister and I 's primary interest were video games and epic fantasy. They usually gave us money or they specifically asked us what book we wanted or asked mom what clothes to get us. OP is doing good. Children appreciate being seen and understood", "Triplet here, and I wholeheartedly agree. I think sometimes people just don\u2019t understand multiples\u2014 my siblings and I always preferred gifts tailored to our interests and acknowledged our existence as individual human beings.", "I mean, Vernon is Duddikins dad.", "I am NOT a twin but still got the exact same gifts as my sister. She was 2 years younger. All of our extended family gifted us the exact same thing all the time. Definitely makes you realize you are just an age group category to them and they don't know or care about your actual interests", "When twins are small, buying similar gifts is fine, but once their individual personalities and interests become more and more apparent, buying them personalized gifts is  better.\n\nNow, if OP bought one an expensive gaming system, and the other a relatively cheap tablet, I could understand the parent's concern.", "My brothers are twins and my mom even went to the trouble to make them separate cakes. She was not a twin, but shared her birthday with her younger sister and hated it.", "[removed]", "Yeah, this is what struck me too. That she wants her \u201cidentical\u201d girls to get identical gifts, and is annoyed at OP treating them like individuals.", "You sound really great.", "[removed]", "My sister is EIGHT years older than me and we still got the same gifts all the time growing up", "u/Ordinarerbet is a bot.", "Based on what the softball package consisted of, and it was only $20 more, it seems like the art supplies were probably decent ones separate from the bag.", "[removed]", "u/Leadinsdvbs is a comment stealing bot\n\n[Link to original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bavv2/aita_for_getting_my_twin_nieces_unfair_birthday/jjaej6y/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)", "u/Enviroxcvb is a bot.", "[removed]", "u/Establifddfgq is a bot.", "u/Fabulofshgds is a bot."]}
