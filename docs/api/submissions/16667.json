She\u2019s so hyperfixated on the number of items that she can\u2019t see how thoughtful the gifts really are, A+ uncle moment.", "Inf o: is your sister Dudley Vernon? \n\n\"But last year, LAST YEAR I got 37!\"\n\nNTA: your nieces are happy, and that's what actually matters.", "You are not the asshole.\nYou got them personal gifts suited to their interests!", "I\u2019m slightly confused that the mother of twelve year old twins hasn\u2019t had this come up for herself. It\u2019s a bit baffling she\u2019d even call you on it.\n\nWe have two daughters. Trying to keep it close monetarily and close in gift counts for Christmas or the like became more and more difficult. Monetarily seemed the wisest choice for our kids, which does create some changes in box counts and such, of course.\n\nNTA.", "Mother of twins here - \n\nNTA - you did wonderfully well and bought gifts that were meaningful to each girl.  Underlined with the gift is the silent message, \u201cI see YOU and I know YOU!\u201d   Their mother is worrying unnecessarily.\n\nAs a mother of identical twin girls, I wanted them to be treated equally but individually. They often received identical gifts but those who know them best know their individual preferences and it means a lot to them. In fact it means more than the dollar value of the gift. \n\nMaybe your sister is worried that one will feel valued more than the other but she is overreacting and will get over it.", "NTA. These are two different activities that require different gear. If your nieces are happy, job done well. Your sis is out of line and doesn't a leg to stand on. I'd let her cool down and move on. Great job on being a good uncle!", "NTA. I think it was quite thoughtful of you to really try to get things they will love. Your sister has a warped sense of fair. I was expecting one of them to get significantly less amd that you truly favored one over the other. but they were gifts perfect for each of them. Good job. NTA but your sister is one though.", "Your sister might be concerned because children can get really jealous and competitive over trival things like literally physical ammount of gifts. And she might be upset because she would know she'd be the one to deal with the in-fighting, not you. But it seems like the girls have no problem, so you've caused no in-fighting. And even if it did cause fighting, NTA.", "NTA. It seems like you got them gifts related to their individual interests. If the kids were happy, that's what matters. The number of items aren't important, especially if the cost of the gifts, as a whole, for each girl, was pretty equal. Your sister, on the other hand, does seem like an a-hole.", "Nta. You got them both gifts suited to their individual tastes, that was really nice of you. And let's be real, you probably saved mom a ton of money. Especially with the sports gear. Your sisters attitude on this is really weird.", "NTA it\u2019s awesome you went out of your way to personalize the gifts.", "NTA, art supplies are expensive, and so are sporting goods. I don't see those gifts as unequal in any way. Especially if you were mostly within the same dollar amount for both. You can't expect the same AMOUNT of gifts when they both have such different hobbies.", "NTA. \n\nThey are each their own person, and you bought thoughtful gifts according to what they like.", "NTA. The gifts were of similar value and chosen for each girl. And the twins each loved their gift! You did nothing wrong- and a lot just right, imo!", "I am a twin.\n\nWe never got individual presents until my girlfriend (now wife) got me one at 18. You gave these kids one thing their own parents don't even give them - a sense of being their own person.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You got both girls the things they were interested in, and neither seem cheap. Especially cleats and sports equipment. Your sister is being very entitled and the girls are happy with what they received. You did nothing wrong and I hope she doesn\u2019t bring this pettiness up in front of the girls.", "NTA - thoughtful gifts are so worth so much more than the amount of gifts - your sister seems wildly entitled to even call you out on this! I bet the girls were super stoked! \n\nYou\u2019re an awesome aunt/uncle!", "NTA - you got your nieces really good presents, both of which included many things fitting their interests. I don\u2019t understand why your sister is so upset about this, unless maybe Nina complained later (which still wouldn\u2019t make you an AH).", "Link your sister here and tell her she\u2019s the AH. NTA.", "NTA. I can see where your sister is coming from. She doesn't want all the drama and fights to ensue if the twins take this perspective, but since the twins love it, she is focusing on an imaginary situation and should let go off it.", "NTA. If the twins don't see any problems I don't understand your sisters stance. I actually thought qjen reading that maybe Aria felt her's didnt cost as much as Nina's and that was the problem.", "NTA. If quantity means more than quality, get your sister a thousand individually wrapped pennies for Christmas.", "NTA\n\nYou selected wonderfully appropriate gifts of similar value and appropriate to the individual interests of each of the girls \n\nDoes your sister always keep a ledger sheet like this?", "NTA at all. Paying attention to your nieces' hobbies and interests and getting gifts to them accordingly doesn't make one an AH, it makes them a good uncle. And there isn't a big price difference. By the title, I thought for a moment you bought one a car and one a unicycle or something. \n\nWhat matters the most is the girls are happy with their gifts. Your sister is being unreasonable here.", "NTA, your sister is acting ridiculous.", "NTA If your nieces loved their gifts I don't see any problems with what you gave them. Perhaps your sister should ask her daughters about how they feel about their gifts (they're old enough now) before passing judgement.", "NTA\n\nYour sister was acting as if your nieces weren't old enough to understand that quantity isn't a big deal when it comes to gifts. You gave them personalized, useful and well thought gifts and they were happy with it. So stick to what they think and not what their mother thinks", "This is INSANE. Not only are you NTA, you sound like the greatest Uncle in history. Amazing, generous, loving gifts. You\u2019re a star, pls tell your idiotic sister I said so.", "NTA Nina literally got more money's worth. Your sister ITA, because decent baseball gear isn't cheap either.", "NTA. The gifts you purchased for them was more than generous and your sister is being very ungrateful.", "NTA, you didn't have to go all out but you did and I'm sure your nieces loved their personalized gifts!! It was equal in terms of that, your sister needs needs to get over it. don't apologize at all or your sister will continue to do behavior like this", "NTA- You took your nieces individual interests into consideration. \nNow if you gave one a cheap plastic bat from the walmart toy section and got the other one an Ipad that would make it unfair and you would be T AH lol.", "NTA. Your sister is acting like an entitled child. Maybe you should give her something next time so that she won\u2019t be that sulky.", "NTA if you got them each specific things of their interests then your sister is too busy seeing them as one", "NTA. I was expecting your sister to be mad about the softball gift because IMO that's the way better gift and I would definitely assume costed more. But that just goes to show how different interests apply.  Idk what she possibly had to be mad about.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Those sound like amazing, personalized gifts for both girls. Your sister is an ungrateful AH for even bringing it up.", "Nta.

There is only one way to solve this situation.  Your sister needs to explain to Aria that Nina didn't get as many things and that wasn't fair.  Your sister should count the exact number of things Nina got and take from Aria all the 'extra' things she got so you can return them to the store.

I'm a twin and it would go back and forth who got more. Sometimes I (M) got more, and sometimes my sister got more. Neither of us ever seemed to care when the other got something better. Typically we both got something we liked and didn't really care what the other got unless it was something we both wanted to use. \n\nOP's sister is overthinking it and should just appreciate that they spent money on both.

She could be mad that he got them more thoughtful/better gifts than her and wanted to find something wrong with it? It seems pretty misdirected", "Maybe she doesn't treat them like indviduals and just gets them the same things?", "I think that fighting over the 'number' of gifts is usually an issue with much younger children.
