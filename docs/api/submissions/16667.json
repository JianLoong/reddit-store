The family went all out for me and got me a ton of tools. I didn't get a kit, I got individual tools; basically 20 presents of tools. My BIL got the jackpot: Nike shoes, speakers, hover board, you name it. The kid deserves it. Ballpark, I was at about $150 for gifts, he was closer to $600. He was upset because I got so many gifts and he only got a few (remember, he's 12). Part of the problem here was I was exclaiming and emoting large at every gift I received because I was grateful and it was my first Christmas with my in-laws. \n\nFrom a parent perspective, you want everything to go smoothly, and while no one was upset at anyone, I felt bad for making my BIL sad. In the end I think he was embarrassed for being upset, and was very grateful, but again, 12.\n\nSounds to me like you got amazing thoughtful gifts for your nieces. They sound fortunate to have you as an uncle. In the end, I bet your sister my feel a pang of shame for bringing up her argument, but may not admit it just to let it blow over.

They are their own unique people and deserve gifts that are tailored to their individual interests.\n\nYour sister is the asshole for saying that the individual interests of her daughters \"don't matter\" and that they should've gotten the same gifts. It sounds like your sister just wants Nina to be a clone of her sister rather than be her own individual person. Plus, Aria and Nina were so happy about their gifts, and all your sister cared about was how many items each of them got and how much they cost.

Softball stuff isn\u2019t cheap.", "NTA, and an incredible uncle and gift giver. So very personalized for each girl.", "Twin here, and I know my sister and I would have been thrilled with different gifts no matter if one was more expensive. Twins are usually seen as being the same so having your own identity acknowledged would have made the gift twice as good. I could see being mad if one got a single candy bar and the other got new sports stuff, but the stuff was similar enough i would not think to look at the price tags.", "NTA. You tried to give gifts the girls would enjoy based on their interests and they were happy with what they got. You weren't trying to elevate one over the other, but as a mother of two daughters I understand where your sister is coming from. I still make sure I buy gifts of equal value and my daughters are nearing 40 years old! hahaha When they were younger they paid attention to that. If one got something \"better\" than the other, they perceived that as favoritism. Do you favor Nina over Aria?", "Some people are super weird about this stuff.  I had 3 daughters and my then wife wouldn\u2019t do anything or by anything that wasn\u2019t 3 of something\u2026. It was a pain.", "NTA.  but your sister sure is.

HOW DARE YOU!? /s\n\nOP you're NTA and you're sister is being ridiculous.  I'm not sure what brought this particular issue on as you've said that normally she isn't like this.  Maybe talk to her and see if something sparked this", "NTA. Your sister has some weird notion of equality in the content/numerical sense, especially given that the softball stuff was actually more expensive. And even if it isn't quite equal, so long as its a good-faith effort towards similar generosity, I think that's all you can do. Generosity is an art, not a science.

Is your sister actually 12?  She's acting like a child whose counting the number of package under the Christmas tree!  Your gifts were thoughtful and were tailored to the interest of each child.  The money spent was comparable.  Your sister is ridiculous in counting the number of markers/pencils against softballs!  She needs to grow up.", "NTA. Lesson learned is to get them ONE thing that is exactly the same. The thing that every twin who commented here not to do.  If Aria and Nina are happy then who cares who mommy thinks.", "NTA, the girls seemed to enjoy the gifts. That's really all that matters.  \n\nI think your sister is unreasonable comparing the number of items, especially considering how different art and sports are.", "What great gifts you got for your nieces.

You obviously made sure to think through thoughtful gifts for each of them and they seem very fair to me.\n\nActually, I think there is more value in letting twins know that they are viewed as individuals and not treating them like carbon copies of each other, giving them identical gifts forever, etc.", "Nta. As the twin of someone who, when growing up, was very careful about things being exactly equal and also had very different interests. The way it was handled was that we made specific lists of stuff we wanted (usually brands, like Lego, Crayola, aurora plushies, etc.) And then left it up to the adults to buy something equal in monetary value or equal in how much we wanted it (I was the cheaper child.) \nAnyway, if your nieces aren't making any sort of stink about it I'd never even dream about mentioning a 'solution' to them. Certainly sounds way less stressful for everyone involved.", "I spend the same amount on all my grandkids. The oldest understands the stuff he wants is more expensive than the toys the others want. He knows they'll have a greater number of gifts", "You gave them both great gifts that they loved. The mom is being super weird. She should be happy you know them individually. It's hard to get gifts like that when there's two and you gotta avoid fights and all that.", "Your sister seems to be like my MIL. My MIL always wants equal gifts for everyone. This includes me and my partner\u2019s brother\u2019s girlfriend as daughters in laws. \n\nFor the boys, 3 brothers, this has always been fine hut is turning into a slight annoyance as all three of them formed their very own interests (the youngest gaming, the middle cars, and the oldest, my partner, is really into home design). \n\nFor us daughter in laws this \u2018rule\u2019 can also be quite stressful as we both are completely different people, with no similar interests at all. Most of the time we both get a candle. And honestly I hate candles but I really can\u2019t tell them that as it would break their hearts probably. One time me and the other DIL got different gifts, which were the most simple things ever. It wasn\u2019t something remotely big, as I just got slippers. My MIL suddenly got into panic mode and sent me out of the room with my slippers \u2018before the other SIL would see that I got a different gift\u2019. We later spoke and she got a very similar gift. We both liked it, but we just didn\u2019t understand the drama of getting different gifts. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the money or what it\u2019s worth. I think your sister wants to treat both her children equally to \u2018not favor anyone\u2019. This includes equal gifts. It\u2019s great what you did, actually caring about what the kids themselves like as their hobby, and to both of them their gift is probably worth millions. \n\nAlso to your sister: most twins hate being treated equally. \n\nNTA", "My mom used to get my sister M&Ms and because those were her favorite. I got Reeses Cups because those were MY favorite. \n\nMom got her like 100 things and me just 2! Should I go NC?!?!?!", "NTA. Seriously what is she even mad about? You said they loved their gifts?? That should be enough.", "NTA\n\n Time to be passive agressive. Just give them cash from now on and tell them you didn't have time to get their mothers approval on your gifts. Teenagers prefer money anyway.", "Your sister is an asshole.  You are not. \n\nNTA", "Twin here you are NTA but I can understand where your sister is coming from.   Sorry to say you should pay attention to number of packages they each open to equalize.  Sounds silly but they are 12 and that might have been a problem but you are fortunate your nieces did not care.  Up until early teens my twin and I used to get same exact gifts from everyone including parents since they did not want to differentiate between us.  However we were two different people with very different interests.  I can see your sister wanting to ensure that her daughter are feeling equal in all things.  Have a conversation with your sister and ask her guidance for next time to elevate her concerns.", "Nta. I think she's gone silent Because technically Nina got more in value but Aria got more in quantity, so now she doesn't know how to approach the situation. Her argument that Aria got more than Nina kind of went out the window when it got revealed that Nina got about $20 extra spent on her, so now her argument has fallen apart.

(Not that she doesn't already, but in her perspective)", "NTA - I always use the same price point for sibling gifts. Of course sometimes that's 10 small things for one and 1 big for the other, etc. Your sister is out of line, your approach is what most people do.

As a fellow artist - the twin who received the art supplies really didn't \"get more\" than the twin who received sports items.
