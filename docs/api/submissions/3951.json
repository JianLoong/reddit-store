You\u2019re not a regular employee who failed to show up for a shift. You gave logical explanations as to why you were not available. All appropriate and no AH behavior there.  \n\nYour friend and manager on the other hand. both AHs. As the owner and manager it is both their responsibility to ensure they have staff. When someone does not show up, if they can\u2019t find someone to fill in, they need to. It might not be feasible, but it\u2019s completely unfair to blame and shame a person who can\u2019t be there when it\u2019s not even their shift or business.  \n\nYour friend is not really a friend if she can lash out and end a friendship so easily over something that\u2019s truly so simple and non serious. It\u2019s not like you did something truly hurtful to her. For Pete\u2019s sake, it\u2019s a shift at a job you don\u2019t even work regularly at. You also informed her you needed to cut back and weren\u2019t available anymore She\u2019s the one who ignored that and continued to try to take advantage of your willingness to work whenever she needed you to. To be angry because you were an hour away and couldn\u2019t get there is so incredibly petty. That\u2019s a pretty lousy reason to end a friendship. Furthermore it\u2019s not your fault that she is understaffed.  The manager is just a bad for expecting you to be their workhorse as well.  It\u2019s on them, not you.", "NTA.  I\u2019m so sorry for the awful way your friend has treated you.  Even an employer who has no personal relationship with you should not be such an ungrateful tyrant.  \n\nAt the risk of giving unsolicited advice:  Resign \u201cstarting immediately\u201d from your part time / on call job.  Do this in writing, just as you would for any other job.  Word your letter as kindly and professionally as possible.  You may express regret over your inability to continue, but do not apologize because you have done nothing wrong.\n\nAfter that the ball is in her court.  She can either start the healing process with an apology, or she can become a bittersweet part of your past.  \n\nIt sounds like the shop left you with many wonderful memories;  so dry your tears and focus on those.", "NTA, that person isn't a real friend and you're better off without them.", "NTA. You are not a permanent employee who is on the schedule and not showing up. You are not required to take any shifts they offer you, and them being short staffed is not your problem.\n\nYou have overworked yourself because you care about your friend and wanted to help. Now your friend needs to care about you and hear you when you say you can not do it.", " NTA. She was your friend only because you were useful to her. She knew you had a full time job yet kept calling you in to help out because she was too cheap and to lay to hire someone. She doesn\u2019t care about you, just what you can do for her. You\u2019re well rid of her. Don\u2019t be sad, be glad.", "NTA. If your \"friend\" is willing to throw away your friendship over this, that person was never really your friend in the first place. I know it sucks when you finally find that out, but it is what it is. Move on and never look back.", "NTA. She's not a true friend", "NTA. You were ASKED and you ANSWERED. They didn\u2019t like the answer and got pissy about it. \n\nYou sound as if you\u2019re (almost) at the end of your rope. Take care of yourself!\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019m sorry your friend is treating you this way. I\u2019ve had some trouble like this myself in a strangely similar context and it really, really sucks.", "NTA obviously", "Your friend is being the Ah here. You\u2019ve been trying to help out but it\u2019s gone on way too long. You told your friend no more shifts. Then your friend demanded you put your own well being on the line and do the shift anyway.\n\nYou are NTA. And that friend, that\u2019s not a friend.", "NTA I hope you are not going to be helping them after this. Your own health and your own job are your responsibility. When people start to act like they are entitled to your time it's time to take your time back. And anyone who would end a 15 year friendship over this is not truly a friend, only someone who wants something from you.", "NTA\nRespond to her saying,\" I received your message and my takeaway is that you really don't care about my health. Well I do so I just want to let you know that I won't be able to do any work for you any more\".", "NTA you don't work there was doing your friend a  favour and it she was using you", "NTA\n\nYou were doing a favor to a friend and they showed how unappreciative they are.", "NTA.  She\u2019s supposed to be your friend NOT your boss.  Her breaking off your friendship over this shows which side of the line she\u2019s on.", "NTA and they were just trying to make you cover so they didn't have to! Well, tough luck on them, they're the owner & manager and if they can't staff it, that's their problem. That they are fine with using you up beyond healthy work/life balance says a lot about the quality of your friendship, honestly - if she doesn't hold to her word about ending it (and I'm suspicious about the amount of days she'll be short-staffed before she'll conveniently forget all she said to you and be all sunshine and roses when she wants you to cover again - right up til you say no again at any rate!) I would encourage you to rethink it anyway. That sort of treatment is unacceptable from anyone, but a \"best\" friend? Nah. The bar is set far too low and she's still ramming straight through it without even an effort to miss.", "The money is nice, but no, I don't really need it, as I have a full time job. I think it's too late to try a to send a polite message, as I already tried that and she just accused me of being a bad friend.", "It's very hard because I have been friends with her for 16 years. I've worked for the business since her mom owned it and I love her mom, and her, and thats why this is so hard. Part of me feels awful for saying no.", "Thank you! This is what I tried to get across to my friend and failed.", "Yeah, but they just glossed over the fact that I couldn't work, they just called me unreliable and tried to guilt trip me.", "Apparently it became my issue when she had to bring her screaming 2 year old to work with her because she's the only person available to cover. There is so much drama that I just can't be involved in it anymore.", "We've had similar issues before, when we were in college together and working together. It was too much and honestly I should have seen the signs, but we fit together as friends so well, I ignored the red flags.", "It wasn't initially, and it shouldn't have been, but as we got older...I guess that's what it turned in to. It sucks for me, and makes me reevaluate all my friendships in general.", "Thank you, you're sweet.", "Part of me still wants to defend her, despite everything, and that sucks because I know what she did wasn't right. Even after discussing it with her in the past, she seemed supportive, but when it suddenly affects her more, as in she has to go cover the shift, suddenly I'm the bad friend.", "Honestly with the amount of drama that goes on there, I'm not surprised. I can mostly keep out of it but I know it gets bad and I will eventually be drawn into it if I continue to cover.", "This. I have a full time job and occasionally they call me and ask if I can cover an extra shift. Key being \"ask\", and I usually say no and they are cool with that and it has never been an issue.      \nA place I don't work at any more and have another full time job? Dream on.", "And that makes me feel worse, the thought that she is using me. Because I love her and have been friend with her for 16 years. I still feel like shit right now, because even if I'm not the asshole, I've lost a friendship that meant a lot to me.", "Thank you. Especially for the end, you're right, I do have a lot of wonderful memories there. I will focus on those and move on.", "Well personally my reply would be that if the only value she has in you as a friend is your ability to be her employee on call 24/7 then she was never your friend in the first place. NTA op, I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ve been having a tough time lately, take this as your sign to prioritise yourself and your mental well being.", "Yes, well, since her definition of friendship relies on exploitation, I think we can safely say she's a poor judge of the matter. \n\nClear NTA.", "The friendship is already over.  Just block her.", "Okay.  Im going to give you a piece of advice.   \n\nIm currently working ONE full-time job.  Last month, I had ONE day off.  (My own choice).   I take every overtime opportunity I can due to trauma from my ex  (Long story), running from my problems, and trying to stay busy.  \n\nIf you don't need the money, have been feeling shitty, and it's NOT your full time job, you have NOTHING to feel bad about.  Nothing.\n\nIf this person was really your friend, when you said you needed a break they would be checking on you, especially if you've consistently been helping up until now.  \n\nThis is absurd.  I work between 58 and 70 hours a week, and my boss has made it VERY clear to me that it is MY choice to do so.  If I don't want to work an extra shift, or I'm feeling burnt out, say the word and they will stop offering. And that's my boss.  Not even a  \"friend\".", "And yet she doesn\u2019t feel awful about putting your health at risk.", "The person who \"fills in\", due to poor management scheduling / hiring practices, is NOT the \"unreliable\" employee.\n\nWalk away from toxic people & relationships.

You need to see it for what it is and move on. It's about what you can do for her not much else.", "It sucks but look how easily they tossed you aside when you wouldn\u2019t bend over backwards for an unreasonable request.  You went above and beyond by helping even after now working a full time job.  They should have never asked once you became fully employed.  They definitely have no right to be upset.  They are ridiculous.", "This, 100% this.", "She refuses to put her daughter in daycare at all. She relies on her mother, fiancee and her fiancee's mother to babysit. She even gets friends if she's desperate, but I've told her it's going to become unfeasible since all of those people work full time as well (apart from her mother who is more of a hands off business owner, she basically only does payroll)", "And thats a HER problem, not a YOU problem :)"]}
