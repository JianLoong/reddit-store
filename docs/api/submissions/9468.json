Your dad was just trying to get you to see another side of things and calm you down. \nYou were having a bad day and wanted a break and some sympathy..you should have given the cashier the same.", "YTA - very much so. From the title of the post I expected him to be the one that acted like you did. I\u2019ll let you in on a secret. Sometimes workers at places will intentionally be obtuse when you are being obviously rude, I\u2019m not saying it is correct I am just saying it happens. You get the energy you put out into the world. Your dad seems to have fine social skills from how you have written this. There is no reason for a parent to coddle you when you are absolutely in the wrong. And your dad still feels it is his job to teach you lessons so that is what he is doing", "YTA - Your dad's social skills are fine.\n\nWhen he asked how your day was going the polite thing to say would have been \"good,  bit dodgey at the grocery store but it all got figured out. How is your day going?\"\n\nInstead you went on a mini rant and started insulting the intelligence of someone you don't actually know instead of,  oh I dunno,  the peculiarities of technology and why sometimes machines don't work the way we want them to.\n\nAlso,  instead of taking a moment to learn some valuable life lessons from a respected elder who presumably you have a good relationship with and whose literal job it is to teach you those life lessons and help you shape your morals, you chose to give HIM crap for \"lecturing\" you. \n\nYeah,  big ol A.", "You're the asshole for not getting that something at her workplace was beyond her control (hint, she had to switch the register, meaning a technical problem).\n\nTalk about irony, you ignorant one.\n\nYta\nYou're the one who needs to learn common sense and social graces.", "YTA, so your dad has no social skills\u2026 but you just kept retrying the payment? after it failed already?", "YTA. Your dad tried to soften your frustration by teaching you empathy and you told him he doesn't have social skills? That's a fairly ironic comment coming from someone so tone deaf to what your dad was doing. You owe him an apology.", "YTA\nI think what your dad has is called\"empathy\", not a lack of social skills. He was probably trying to help you see another side to the situation so maybe you wouldn't be so angry...(hangry??) Give the guy some credit and enjoy the time with him. Some of us would give anything to have one more conversation with a parent, whether it be good or bad.", "YTA\n\nYour Dad made a good point about having perspective when it comes to things like dealing with other people. It wasn\u2019t a lecture, it was good life advice. You don\u2019t always know the mindset someone is in or what they are going through. That cashier could have just gotten a text saying their dog died or something.\n\nAlso, as someone who uses mobile pay, I run into this problem a lot. It\u2019s not the cashier\u2019s fault that the mobile pay didn\u2019t work. They don\u2019t install the system nor do they have the skills to fix it. They just use it. Sounds like that was the problem since going to another register solved the problem. Sounds like you have some insecurity about being corrected and also a slight problem with patience and understanding. Given this story, perhaps your father felt as though you needed to hear what he said and I agree. Maybe it\u2019s not him who needs a refresher course on social skills. Be kind to people.", "YTA.\n\nYou just started ranting negativity at him...\n\nAre those the \"social skills\" you're speaking of?", "YTA.

You need to apologize to your dad for your lack of social skills", "YTA.  Honestly if someone started saying things like that about a retail worker to me I'd also call them out.  You can vent about your stressful day without being disrespectful.  Sounds like you also decided to take out your frustration on your dad too when the conversation didn't go the way you expected it to.", "YTA. The problem was your social skills, not his.", "YTA.

What you COULD have said to your dad was \"Dad, I just needed to vent some frustration, I understand the other people are not to blame, I'm just having a rough day.\" What I have read here is a severe lack of social skills on YOUR part - you put ALL the blame on everyone else for your bad day (and that update about the cashier being useless because they are attractive? Wtf is wrong with you?), then when your dad tried to help YOU to empathize and realize it's just a bad day, you lost your shit at him unnecessarily. YOU need to learn some social skills.", "YTA.

YTA 100% \n\nYour father is right, you should listen to him. And most of the time workers cannot do anything if payments don't work and most of the time they can't switch registers as a lot of the time their name is attached to the drawer of money and if the total is off they would be in big trouble. \n\nYou are acting like there is a magical button that the cashier could touch and it would make your payment work. *Spoiler* there isn't. I've worked fast food as a worker then manager and now work at a higher end department store and if a payment doesn't work there isn't much we can do on our end. Carry a card in case your phone doesn't work and please be polite to workers even if you're having a rough day.", "YTA. He\u2019s nicely trying to teach you to respect service workers.", "YTA I know who needs to learn social skills and it aint dad.", "YTA. You need to have some patience and get some social skills of your own. Your dad sounds like he has solid social skills.", "Yta and needs to learn social skills like empathy", "My guy, it's actually you that needs to work on your social skills. YTA.", "Yta. Im that cashier most days. You sound really young and immature. Your dad tried to put it in perspective for you but you crapped on him.", "YTA I feel bad for you especially bc you sound so young to have such ugly impatient entitled imature bitterness inside. I know that can't feel good. What a sad way to go through life.  Listen to your dad he is right and he was taking a moment help you. I would say same thing to my sons in this situation bc\nI would know I failed my kids if they turned out miserable assholes and your dad is just doing his job. \n\nI hope YOU learn empathy and social skills.\nYou will be a much happier person I promise.\n\nEdit: I read in the comments that your dad was abusive.  I'm sorry about that.  I know what an abusive parent like first hand and all the future  ramifications and personality issues it can cause. He was still right in this situation.  I hope therapy helps you.", "YTA If you want to lecture people on their social skills you'd better have some of your own first. Your communication isn't mature or effective. You also seen to have the bad habit of taking your bad day out on other people.\n\nYou need to have a talk with your dad that sometimes you just need to vent. Then when he offers advice just tell him you're venting. Some people are solution oriented, and it legitimately doesn't occur to them that venting is cathartic and productive. It's just a personality difference, it doesn't mean one person is right and the other is wrong. It definitely doesn't warrant biting someone's head off and insulting them.\n\nIf you're willing to put the work in, to develop you maturity, you'll find your relationships much more fulfilling and meaningful.", "YTA\n\nI've had the same thing.  I'm just venting and I get a lecture.  I just ask \"Hey, I'm just venting, yes I know that.  Just let me vent for a sec.  I know what your saying.\"  My own father I feel like we never talk, he just waits for a time to lecture me.  But it's a feeling, and instead of insulting his social skills I plan to just talk to him next time I see him.  Using words.  Words that don't insult him.  Trying to find a common ground where we can come more together instead of driving a dagger further.\n\nBut what makes you the AH is you made it personal.  He has social skills.  But not everyone is going to be able to read your mind and fit into what your brain needs right then.  Sounds like you have your own social skills to work on (but then again, who doesn't?).  If you don't like what he's saying.  Just be honest about what your feeling.  You are trying to be cruel for the sake of being cruel to your own parent.  Hey I get it.  Families can be complicated.  Sometimes we put our foots in our mouths.  But it's good to take a step back, and take a breath.  Should he be always lecturing you?  No, I believe not.  But do you need to get that nasty to him?  No.  Before you start lecturing people on their social skills take a look in the mirror.  Cool off, get off the high horse, and use some better words and maybe both of you will consider some other perspectives.", "Yes. \n\nYTA. He\u2019s right. People do have bad days. You\u2019re having one yourself. And that\u2019s ok. I understand your frustration at the situation you were \n in. I really do! Especially since you were hungry. But I feel that the cashier may have been waiting for your payment to go through, and may not have known what to do or even perhaps was new and not fully trained. There\u2019s 100 different situations that could have been a factor here. A bit of understanding is in order here.. the world doesn\u2019t stop just because we are in it as the center of the universe. You telling him he needed social skills because he told you something you something you didn\u2019t want to hear or agree with you.. so you lashed out.. at least you\u2019re asking if you\u2019re the asshole which tells me you have some remorse and maybe even feel bad about your behavior. Which is to the good! Try to do better.", "My dad does the EXACT same thing as yours, and I\u2019ll admit that it can be a little frustrating sometimes, like \u2018I\u2019m just here to vent, be on my side!\u2019 Haha, but I think it is also cool he tries to get you to consider others and what they could be going through. Maybe she was a having a bad day and her mind was elsewhere during your transaction, or maybe she just really didn\u2019t know what she was doing, either way, it is what it is. \nI\u2019d suggest maybe don\u2019t vent to your dad if you don\u2019t get the responses you\u2019d like from him, that\u2019s totally okay.", "YTA / ESH\n\nHe's your dad, not your friend.

I feel *insert emotions* when you attempt to lecture me instead of recognizing the validity of my feelings.\"\n\nOr try setting boundaries. \"When I'm sharing my feelings with you, if you attempt to lecture me I will end the conversation/change subjects/hang up/leave\" etc. after expressing how his lecturing makes you feel.\n\nThe irony is that he wants you to see from their perspective but wholly refuses to, at the very least, aknowledge your own.", "Your dad sounds like a very kind and empathetic person.

If it's a mechanical error you can't blame the cashier.  Or she may have been having a bad day and that's why she didn't seem to respond quickly.  Maybe she was having a moment of being overwhelmed for some reason.  I understand you were frustrated, but saying someone is an idiot when you DON'T KNOW what is going on in their life or mind at that moment is really not fair.  Maybe she literally was having an absence seizure and is undiagnosed...that ACTUALLY happens.  I have known more than one person who had minor seizures and went undiagnosed for YEARS because an absence seizure is so mild that it simply looks like someone is standing there not paying attention for 40-90 seconds.  \n\nThe point your dad was trying to make is the same one I am saying: You don't KNOW what is happening in their life, so being impatient and thinking they have reduced mental capacity based on one interaction is unkind and also unnecessary.  We can all give our fellow humans more grace than we do, I am guilty of being impatient myself, but I do try to be a better human and be more patient simply because WE ALL need to live and work on this rock hurtling through space, and it's better when we do it in an attitude of togetherness and solidarity.  There is already enough division in our world, why add to it?  \n\nABOVE ALL ELSE: Don't worry about it too much, you were having a rough day and we all need to forgive ourselves for being less than kind and impatient with our fellow humans.  You had a moment, your dad was trying to teach you to be more patient, and that is an admirable thing your dad is doing, because all parents should teach their kids to be good humans, but not all parents do. Your dad cares about your interactions with others, and that is a good thing for a dad to do.", "Info: How old are you? This sounds like it was written by my three year old. \n\nYTA either way.
