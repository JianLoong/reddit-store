This relationship is unbalanced because they're choosing to make you responsible for them. The responsibility they're placing on you would only be appropriate if you were making flights for your incapable children or family too elderly to use a computer. This doesn't apply to your parents because they're mentally competent adults.\n\nOne term for what you've been burdened with is mental load. Mental load is a term for the invisible labor involved in managing a household and family. Also sometimes referred to as \"worry work\" or \"cognitive labor,\" the mental load is about not the physical tasks but rather the overseeing of those tasks.\n\nYour parents have dumped their mental load on you.\n\nYou've clearly communicated with your parents and the message couldn't be clearer. At some point, they consciously chose not to reply to you while choosing to ignore the clear consequences of their situation. Now that the consequences have hit, they're choosing to blame you instead of accepting they did something wrong.\n\nThe language your parents are using is called DARVO. DARVO stands for \"Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender.\" The perpetrator or offender may Deny the behavior, Attack the individual doing the confronting, and Reverse the roles of Victim and Offender such that the perpetrator assumes the victim role and turns the true victim -- or the whistle blower -- into the one who did wrong.\n\nThe mental load issue and using DARVO make it appear as if your parents have abusive/inappropriate tendencies and take advantage of you while forcing you to be responsible for them. If this is the case, it's long overdue in being stopped.", "This is why I travel solo.", "NTA You are trying to *have* a trip.

My boss is happy to rock up to the office without a desk booked and without telling anyone she's coming in, whereas I filled in all the rota sheets, book myself a desk and make all of the other arrangements so everything is in place. I can't cope with not doing and just presuming a desk will be available, but I'm not an organised planner (I just get stressed without a plan.) The reason that works with my boss and I is because we both respect that we are different and we just let each other get on with our own things. If I booked her a desk and then she decided she wasn't coming in, she'd be in the dark and smelly for not cancelling it. If she tells me to come in when I can't book a desk, I panic. \n\nThe place where you and your parents are having issues and where they are acting like TAs is that you have done what works for you and what suits you and are leaving them to do the same (though I wouldn't have told them to figure their shit out because it sounds like that's what they intend to do) and they will do what works for them and actually, that's fine.

What if a better plan or invitation comes along and I can't just change my plans without a penalty?) and it is exasperating.\n\nGood for you for getting your own trip taken care of.

My son flew back to the US last October and it was \u20ac1200 for a round trip (but he booked the flight only a few months out). \n\nBasically anything less than \u20ac1.000 for a round trip, is a pretty good deal.  \n\nAs for the hotel, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a high tourist area, because that\u2019s a high price for the region I live in, probably normal though, for Rome/Firenze/Milano/Veneto (the major tourist zones).", "I think you are NTA, but I do think that it might have been kinder to give them a warning that came with an exact expiration date. \"If you don't give me your planned itinerary by XX/XX, I'm going to book this myself.\" Just asking a bunch and then saying, \"You always book late so I did it myself\" isn't necessarily *wrong*, but it doesn't give you as much of the moral high ground.", "I guess you showed them.", "They paid for my flight and I paid for hotel", "Clearly you\u2019ve never tried to get a last minute hotel while there\u2019s  a comicon in town.", "Of course they'll be able to get flights, but they'll pay more for them.  Maybe OP likes to get the best prices.\n\nNTA.  She does her thing, they do theirs.", "Ah yeah that\u2019s tough.", "Not sure if you\u2019re considered an adult for airline purposes", "I doubt it will be quite that easy.", "Maybe because she didn't want her sis to suffer the consequences of her parents lack of planning. Because the way I see it, sis will not be able to go with OP as originally planned and will have to go with her parents", "Did you actually Read her post?? \n\nOP had said her sister was meant to fly with her, but her parents didn't have their dates.. when they finally got back to her with dates, OP had already booked her own flight, she tried booking a flight for her sister, but couldn't because her sister is a minor..\n\nI commented on the fact she could of put her sister as an unaccompanied minor where the airline provides a chaperone to get the minor on the flight and a chaperone to meet her at the destination.. \n\nNow next time you want to come at someone with a comment, make sure you have ACTUALLY read and UNDERSTOOD the post and someone's comment to it", "There's a handful of places I've seen require the traveler be 25! Double-Triple-Check-With Sprinkles!", "You need to check the hotel websites for their terms and conditions. Not sure what Italy is like, but I was checking hotels around Sea-Tac airport for my daughter, and some hotels wouldn\u2019t rent to people under 21, others went as low as 18.  You don\u2019t want to arrive in Italy and be turned away from your hotel.", "That\u2019s underage in many many places. Most hotels in the US won\u2019t rent to minors under 21. Be sure to check on this", "If cost is of concern, are your parents aware that they are paying quite a bit more booking hotels, flights and such at the last minute than they would have had they actually planned ahead? \n\nNTA\n\nAt least one of you sounds like you'll make the family vacation. I know this sucks for your sister, but in the future maybe you can get plans pre-approved with the parents so you can book for her too so she doesn't have to suffer from your parents executive functioning shortcomings on future trips.", "Have your parents ever travelled internationaly before?", "You're above 18, i dont see why you couldnt order for your sister too..? Anyways i feel bad for her and you. Enjoy your trip, dealing with inconsistent parents and family sucks a lot, missed 3, 3!!! trips due to it.

When I went a few years ago, a nice hotel in the city was a minimum of $200/night.", "They are adults, and they can go ahead and book their own flights and hotel. Nothing she did is stopping them from doing that.  Adults can book their own travels separately it's not a big deal. If they wanted her to do the booking work then they would have gotten back to her.  I don't understand why they are so angry- she booked her own travel as any responsible person should do. Since they are traveling on different dates, she couldn't have booked them on the same itinerary anyway. \n\nI've traveled with last minute schedulers,  and they were PISSED when I had the nice sleeping car on the overnight train ( they were sleeping almost sitting up in their seats)  and I was staying at a really nice hotel for the price they were paying for a hostel.  Not my problem.", "Still NTA. From my understanding you were always going to arrive earlier/leave later so the flight isn\u2019t a big deal at all. It honestly doesn\u2019t take that long to fix a flight issue.", "Then sis will just have to go with her parents. They can figure it out, as OP said. That consequence of the parent's delay is not OP's problem. She can feel bad for her sister if she wants but that still doesn't put responsibility on OP.", "And what I'm saying is OP shouldn't be booking for her sister at all. OP has no obligation so it's strange anyone would suggest she does. Her parents are trying to off load their responsibility to OP. I understood the post perfectly. You on the other hand seem to think OP has some kind of parenting responsibilities for a kid that isn't hers. It doesn't matter if OP and sister were to fly together. The PARENTS are the ones who need to book the kid's flight, not OP. Op shouldn't even have access to her sister's passport.", "In italy people are minors until 18 so 20 is more than fine", "We\u2019ve gone to Mexico a few times", "Probably because she is not the parent of the minor sister and international travel is involved.\n\nAnd by the sounds of it, I would be surprised if they are not waiting for minor sisters passport to arrive.", "Yeah. The plan was always for me to leave and come back a few days earlier", "Right, OP had no responsibility to book for her sister, but she wanted to book for her sister, that's all. Her parents may be dicks but it seems like OP really wanted to get her sister there at least, regardless of who that should've fallen to, but the parents made that impossible.", "Info: are you paying for the flights and hotels you\u2019re booking? Or are you using your parents card to do this (or a card that they pay for)?", "Show them that what you found is cheap compared to absolutely anything you can book a week from now. \n\nIt's the middle of winter, everyone's gone home after the holidays, it's not peak peak prices anymore, and it will still be expensive", "Maybe they are from eu and don't need passports", "We\u2019re from the us"]}
