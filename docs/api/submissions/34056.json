This relationship is unbalanced because they're choosing to make you responsible for them. The responsibility they're placing on you would only be appropriate if you were making flights for your incapable children or family too elderly to use a computer. This doesn't apply to your parents because they're mentally competent adults.\n\nOne term for what you've been burdened with is mental load. Mental load is a term for the invisible labor involved in managing a household and family. Also sometimes referred to as \"worry work\" or \"cognitive labor,\" the mental load is about not the physical tasks but rather the overseeing of those tasks.\n\nYour parents have dumped their mental load on you.\n\nYou've clearly communicated with your parents and the message couldn't be clearer. At some point, they consciously chose not to reply to you while choosing to ignore the clear consequences of their situation. Now that the consequences have hit, they're choosing to blame you instead of accepting they did something wrong.\n\nThe language your parents are using is called DARVO. DARVO stands for \"Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender.\" The perpetrator or offender may Deny the behavior, Attack the individual doing the confronting, and Reverse the roles of Victim and Offender such that the perpetrator assumes the victim role and turns the true victim -- or the whistle blower -- into the one who did wrong.\n\nThe mental load issue and using DARVO make it appear as if your parents have abusive/inappropriate tendencies and take advantage of you while forcing you to be responsible for them. If this is the case, it's long overdue in being stopped.", "This is why I travel solo.", "NTA You are trying to *have* a trip.

My boss is happy to rock up to the office without a desk booked and without telling anyone she's coming in, whereas I filled in all the rota sheets, book myself a desk and make all of the other arrangements so everything is in place. I can't cope with not doing and just presuming a desk will be available, but I'm not an organised planner (I just get stressed without a plan.) The reason that works with my boss and I is because we both respect that we are different and we just let each other get on with our own things. If I booked her a desk and then she decided she wasn't coming in, she'd be in the dark and smelly for not cancelling it. If she tells me to come in when I can't book a desk, I panic. \n\nThe place where you and your parents are having issues and where they are acting like TAs is that you have done what works for you and what suits you and are leaving them to do the same (though I wouldn't have told them to figure their shit out because it sounds like that's what they intend to do) and they will do what works for them and actually, that's fine.

What if a better plan or invitation comes along and I can't just change my plans without a penalty?) and it is exasperating.\n\nGood for you for getting your own trip taken care of. You're not being controlling - that would be making plans FOR THEM and forcing them to go along with them; trying to ruin the trip - how, exactly?

Maybe remind dad of that, this might make him a bit more comfortable with booking in a timely fashion.
