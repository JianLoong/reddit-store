You gave her a conditional $8k, to be spent on a wedding. But you gave your son an unconditional $8k, to be spent however he liked. Your son got the better deal, because he gets more of a choice. Your daughter had some choice in how to budget her wedding, but didn't have the option to, say, invest or save half of it for the future. \n\nYou did the best you could to be as fair as possible.

Never before my engagement would I have every thought I\u2019d say yes and had turned down or left at even the discussion of marriage before my husband.", "Cool, all that means is that you didnt know what you wanted. It doesnt give anyone the right to tell someone else they dont know what they want.", "15 years ago I was 100% certain I would never get married, and never have children. It was by choice, I wanted neither of these things.\n\nNow I'm married to a wonderful woman and we have a beautiful eight year old daughter. (No, she was not an accident. I didn't get married because of my pregnancy, we married first and planned for her. I simply met someone and changed my mind.) \n\nPeople and circumstances change. Insisting that someone's desires and opinions will never change is a bit shortsighted."]}
