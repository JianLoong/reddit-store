Since your son does not want to get married, you'll never have the opportunity to match the gift you gave your daughter, so giving that amount is a decent compromise.\n\nHowever, your daughter is right, it is somewhat unfair. You gave her a conditional $8k, to be spent on a wedding. But you gave your son an unconditional $8k, to be spent however he liked. Your son got the better deal, because he gets more of a choice. Your daughter had some choice in how to budget her wedding, but didn't have the option to, say, invest or save half of it for the future. \n\nYou did the best you could to be as fair as possible.

Son got his money at the age of 32. 8k is a good chunk of money regardless, but she benefited a lot by not having to wait 8 years for it. Sure it was earmarked for a wedding, but maybe that meant that she and her husband could buy a house sooner because they didn't have to save for the wedding. What could the son have used that money for at age 24 that he didn't get to?", "It\u2019s still none of the daughter\u2019s business. Mom decided to give brother money.

However, if they\u2019re daughter was getting married, they offered to contribute or she asked for a contribution, and there was no previous discussion about money and conditions, OP isn\u2019t TA. My dad contributed money to my brother\u2019s wedding and subsequently told my sister and I he would do the same to even it out. That was the first we\u2019d ever heard about such money. If this went down in a similar way, I absolutely would not call OP an AH.", "You're saying daughter wasn't able to use her own words and say \"Hey OP, I'd rather use that money for something else\" ?", ">What if she and her fianc\u00e9 or planning to elope, and then money was offered for the wedding?\n\nThen she could have said \"We're planning to elope, save your money.\" That would have saved OP $16,000", "She\u2019s fairly complaining that she didn\u2019t get a choice when her brother did. \n\nDad says he was trying to be fair and wasn\u2019t.", "But isn't it a bit entitled, as an adult, to be up in her mother's business like that?

As soon as the option to invest becomes available, it is no longer fair.", "Especially as I HIGHLY doubt if OP had given daughter 8k and said to use it for the wedding or save it, doesn't matter to us, the daughter would've saved it. True, there is no way to know that for sure but by the way she is complaining (and the fact she's in her early 20s), there is a high probability she would have still spent it on her wedding.", "Yeah, presumably she was going to spend the money on the wedding anyway, so having it earmarked for a certain use isn't really so relevant. A bit like cash vs supermarket gift card - yes cash is more versatile, but sooner or later you'd be spending the money at a supermarket anyway.\n\nIf daughter spent more on her wedding than she otherwise would have because of the conditions,  I can see how she'd be a bit pissed though.", "But if you give unfairly or show favouritism, you have to accept that your children can choose to distance themselves from you. \n\nOP set the condition: you get married, you get 8k for your wedding. Then he changed that condition for his son. Okay, cool. Daughter isn\u2019t wrong to say it\u2019s unfair and daughter is free to distance herself from OP and is well within her right to.

Honestly, I feel like a lot of people here wld get up in arms at her for dictating how they can give her a gift or what specifically they can spend it on. It is rude to put rules, on a gift, if my parents were like heres x amount of money specifically for ur wedding, but I was like nope gimme a check instead people wld call me entitled. Which is also why I said it is important to know from the OP if his daughter asked specifically for the money for her wedding from him or if he offered (which they have not answered).  In my mind that money isn't paid to the daughter but to the vendors, so it important to know if she wanted a big wedding or if it was gifted. I'm not gonna look a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nAlso, my parents paid for my sisters wedding I don't need or want the same, that was their gift to her.", "We'd probably need more info on why the daughter thought the $8K she was given at 24 or 26 was only for her wedding.   The asshole in me is saying that if you need $8K for other things, dont spend all the gifted $8K on a wedding.", "Well since OP can\u2019t magically go back and unpay for his daughter\u2019s wedding, what exactly do you think is the fair thing to do? Would it have been any fairer for OP not to give the son any money? \n\nIt\u2019s easy to say OP should have offered the daughter the money for the wedding, but that\u2019s what it was originally intended for and life circumstances changed, so OP adapted.", "Yeah, I was given $X for my wedding, but spent $X-Y for it and used the remaining funds for other things. The daughter had this option (I assume).", "I think the fair thing to do is \n\nA.) Set a separate wedding fund for the brother to only be spent if he gets married and a cash gift to the sister she can spend or invest as she pleases. \n\nB.)

This is before you consider the compounding benefits of having a second income.\n\nBluntly, marriage is a major life event and should be celebrated, but it does leave single people less well off.

Single people have no equivalent social event to generate wealth. \n\nSo, sure, money with no conditions is better, but more money to largely or entirely fund a major life event that will end up making you even more money and putting you ahead because of your lifestyle choice is better than money than money than less money.\n\nThe daughter will also have a second person to rely", "Amazing excuse for treating your children differently.", "I don\u2019t believe they set up an arbitrary age limit.
