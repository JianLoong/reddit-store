You didn't offer the cash to daughter because there was a wedding to pay for, that was the INITIAL plan for both is what I am surmising from your post.

She could have used it to go back to school. She could have used it to buy herself something she's always wanted or really needed.\n\nThe thing is, you gave her money for a specific purpose and you gave your son a cash gift he is free to spend, save, or invest as he pleases. Do you not see the difference?\n\nUltimately, it's your money to give or not to give, but you offered it with a double standard.

An $8k wedding is already pretty low key budget wise, that covers maybe a venue, catering, cake, and a dress. \n\nIs your daughter making a stink because she and her husband have financial issues? If so, she could have asked you to put the money toward something else, instead of the wedding. Since she didn't ask and you didn't offer, it's a non-issue. She gratefully accepted your gift, but now wants to complain? \n\nAlso, if you had spent less on her wedding then it sounds like you would have given a smaller, but equal cash gift to your son. So either way she would be mad. \n\nYour daughter is just being grumpy and entitled.", "NAH\n\nIt all seems even, but perhaps she\u2019d have spent the $8k on something else if it had been a gift rather than specifically a contribution to a wedding.\n\nSo I understand your reasoning, and I understand her thinking $8k-specifically-for-a-wedding isn\u2019t the same as $8k-no-strings-attached, and I think all feelings are valid here.

It's OP's money. \n\nThey don't have to give each child the exact same thing if they don't want to. They may not have the same needs, relationship (with OP) or earning potential.

The son now has choices, she got no choice.", "But maybe if daughter knew she would get 8K or wedding funds she may have had a smaller wedding and saved the money for a home.

Now maybe wishes cash could have been used for a stripped down wedding and house payment.", "Yeah. To me this just seems like anger from the daughter that the son got 8k.

Drives me crazy and this smells the same.", "Yeah this is what I thought I'm very surprised everyone thinks the daughter is just entitled.", "Very well said. It's not about the specific amount. I wonder if she actually wanted the money for the wedding or if it was only offered for the wedding. If she wasn't getting married wld she have gotten a random large check to do whatever she wanted with and to that point wld the son have gotten money if sister didn't get married?\n\nYTA", "ok, she can pay the 8k back from her wedding and then he'll give her 8k to do with as she pleases.", "But that does also mean she had 8k less to contribute to the wedding herself, that money could have been invested?", "I got married for 1,5 k, she wanted a wedding and it sounds like a big one, she didn't have to have a big one  anyway but she chose to have one because dad will give her the money.\n\nShe made a choice.", "Yeah you're missing the point, OP gave 8k to the daughter for her wedding then to even it out found out the son wasn't going to get married but still gifted him 8k.  IF she wasn't going to get married at the time, then she or her brother likely wouldn't have received a dime... until the daughter was engaged in the future, and we'd be commenting about this some other day.\n\nYou're just arguing a point, your point, just to argue I think.  You're also wrong btw.  The daughter was given 8k for her wedding, didn't mean she had to spend 8k... only to complain about the gift later.", "No, the point is both got 8k each.\n\nShe just wants more.", "If someone gives you money for a wedding and only a wedding, you spend it.  If given the option, you might spend it elsewhere.", "Yeah, but if her dad was giving her $8k that she thought had to be spent on a wedding, then she might as well have a wedding that costs $8k or more.", "Sorry, I suck at explaining that. 8k is 8k. She was going to have a wedding regardless and would have needed to spend 8k, whether it was from her account or gifted from her mom's. So her brother, if he decides to get married some day, will still have to spend money out of his own account, because he used his gifted 8k on something else", "while this would be the logical option, it is not what people choose in real life, it is hard to have a wedding for less than 8 thousand without eloping and she probably wouldn\u2019t have eloped", ">I never intended to give my son 8k in cash, but if he isn't going to be married, it only seems fair.\n\nPeople are overlooking this part. The 8k was always meant for a wedding.

Do we know she wanted a bigger wedding? \n\nThe son essentially got that money with no strings attached whereas she was only given money bc she was getting married and it was specifically for her wedding. The son can do whatever and invest it and make more money.", "It means that maybe she would have not spent that money on wedding. \n\nGiven that her dad was going to give her $8k for a wedding, she might as well have a wedding that costs $8k or more.

Did she ask or did he offer?", "She is not asking for more.  She finds it was unfair for hers to be contingent and his not.\n\nI know people given an option at wedding time, money for wedding or house payment or honeymoon.  Many had a smaller wedding to use it elsewhere.", "I see it as both daughter and son got $8K for weddings.  Son decided not to have a wedding and daughter is mad her brother didn't spend it on a $8K wedding.\n\nThey are both adults that received $8K and spent it on different things.", "She didn't have to spend 8k on a wedding though.

If told this is for your wedding only, would have spent it all on the wedding.", "I know it feels like the daughter wldve been fine with a small wedding and money to say invest. The son can invest that and end up with more money.", "No matter what you say, the math is correct.\n\nBoth got 8k.", "I'll say it again.\n\no.\n\n 8k is 8k, both got the same, she can get over it.", "The daughter didn\u2019t know that spending it on something other than a wedding was an option.", "Nah, whatever you say, 8k is 8k for each.\n\nHe didn't have to give them anything, daughter is being entitled af.", "Weddings cost more than 8k.\nIf she made the wedding bigger because she got the money than it's simply her fault.

And really she cldve been like I'm gonna have a small wedding then OP said no do a bigger wedding here is 8k and she thought that money had to go to a wedding, so she didn't have a choice.", "I was using that as an example of things that parents give money to kids where dont need to \"even\" up the score by giving the same amount to their other kids. I'm saying that if my dad turned around and was like well ur never gonna have kids so here's the same amount of money, I myself wld be like that's not fair my sister didn't ask for that money u offered it i shldnt get a payout like that just based on what my sister got.  That's why I said it matters if the daughter asked for the money or if it was offered. Especially, bc OP prob paid vendors not her."]}
