It's so irritating and it prevents me from being allowed to express myself.\n\n\nIt happened again last night at dinner table. We had an argument about him forgetting to fill my car with gas after he used it and when I expressed my frustrtation he said \"we will not talk about this now since you appear to be on your period\". I said that I was not on my period and that this was just me feeling frustrated with him. He insisted he won't talk about this then and insisted he won't hear what I had to say since \"I was on my period since I was being irrational during the argument\". I snapped and had enough. So I got up, stood infront of him while he was still eating and pulled down my pants and showed him my underwear. He made a grossed out face and shouted \"f that's nasty, I'm eating my damn dinner damnit\". We had a full blown argument and he said I acted horribly and ruined his appetite by pulling that nasty move. He told me to grow up and stop being spiteful over nothing.\n\n\n\nHe keeps saying I grossed him out during dinner and made him go to bed hungry. AITA?
