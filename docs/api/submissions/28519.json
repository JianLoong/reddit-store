Once I buy a house in the next upcoming years is when I will bring them out. I went to an estate sale this summer and bought mostly clothes, and also a beautiful vase. I bought it for 40 dollars and it didnt look expensive to me, but another collector friend of mine saw it in the background of one of my stories and asked me where I got it from and said it looked like a vintage vase hes been looking for. I went and got it appraised and come to find out its worth 3,500 dollars. I made sure to get its authentication as well. I did leave it in my bookcase and decided to keep it as decoration even though I typically put expensive furniture/decor in my storage unit.  \n\n\nThis week my boyfriend (30M) came over and unexpectedly brought his ten year old son. He lives in NYC with his mom and he has him during the summer, but he came back to stay with my boyfriend for a bit since his mom just had a baby that was in the NICU. I didnt mind since his son is nice and has never damaged anything of mine. When his dad and I were cooking in the kitchen he was watching TV in my living room. All of a sudden I hear a crash and we run into my living room to see my new vase shattered. His son started crying saying he wanted to see a book I had in my bookshelf and saw the vase and thought it looked cool and \u201ctouched it\u201d and it fell. His dad reassured him and saying its okay he\u2019ll replace it and to make sure hes not hurt.  \n\n\nI was upset but said it was okay and kept my composure. Later I spoke to him when he came over alone and we agreed hes to pay me back. He asked me how much it is and I said its worth 3,500. He raised an eyebrow and asked how much I paid since he knows I always find things at the sales and I was honest and said 40 dollars. He told me he would pay me the 40 and I said absolutely not. Just because the woman that sold me it didn\u2019t know its true price doesn\u2019t mean I dont and if I ever sold it I would charge its appraisal worth so he needs to pay me back the appraised price. Hes not hurting for money, he makes 800k a year. I make 200k so Im not asking him to as if I dont have money, its the principle since his son broke it he should pay the appraised price. He sent me the money but was upset saying Im an asshole since I got it for so much cheaper.

I buy all my designer goods (most vintage so its amazing quality) from them and they\u2019re a hidden gem since barely any people even go to them in my area so Ive been able to find amazing things. I bought so much jewelry/clothes/furniture from estate sales that I later get appraised for thousands while I spent 300 on it max. Ive been able to find amazing things for a cheap price.  \nI love to decorate my condo with the things I buy and make sure all my extremely expensive things are kept safe in a storage unit. Once I buy a house in the next upcoming years is when I will bring them out. I went to an estate sale this summer and bought mostly clothes, and also a beautiful vase. I bought it for 40 dollars and it didnt look expensive to me, but another collector friend of mine saw it in the background of one of my stories and asked me where I got it from and said it looked like a vintage vase hes been looking for. I went and got it appraised and come to find out its worth 3,500 dollars. I made sure to get its authentication as well. I did leave it in my bookcase and decided to keep it as decoration even though I typically put expensive furniture/decor in my storage unit.  \nThis week my boyfriend (30M) came over and unexpectedly brought his ten year old son. He lives in NYC with his mom and he has him during the summer, but he came back to stay with my boyfriend for a bit since his mom just had a baby that was in the NICU. I didnt mind since his son is nice and has never damaged anything of mine. When his dad and I were cooking in the kitchen he was watching TV in my living room. All of a sudden I hear a crash and we run into my living room to see my new vase shattered. His son started crying saying he wanted to see a book I had in my bookshelf and saw the vase and thought it looked cool and \u201ctouched it\u201d and it fell. His dad reassured him and saying its okay he\u2019ll replace it and to make sure hes not hurt.  \nI was upset but said it was okay and kept my composure. Later I spoke to him when he came over alone and we agreed hes to pay me back. He asked me how much it is and I said its worth 3,500. He raised an eyebrow and asked how much I paid since he knows I always find things at the sales and I was honest and said 40 dollars. He told me he would pay me the 40 and I said absolutely not. Just because the woman that sold me it didn\u2019t know its true price doesn\u2019t mean I dont and if I ever sold it I would charge its appraisal worth so he needs to pay me back the appraised price. Hes not hurting for money, he makes 800k a year. I make 200k so Im not asking him to as if I dont have money, its the principle since his son broke it he should pay the appraised price. He sent me the money but was upset saying Im an asshole since I got it for so much cheaper. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You don't get to decide whether or not it 'means enough' to someone to be worth the price. \n\nIf it was a 10 year old TV, you pay the price a ten year old TV is worth, not a new one.  If it was some rare collectable. You pay the price to replace it with one of equal vintage and value, not a new off the shelf. \n\nYour opinion on its value means sweet fuck all in that situation.", "That's a public place so that's already different and she didn't expect the kid to be there.", "Because her condo is not a public playcenter. Her boyfriend brought his kid over without even asking or giving her a heads-up. It's her condo, she lives there, if there is a kid there, he is a guest and shouldn't touch things without asking permission. If his father hasn't taught him that, he should pay for the damages the kid caused.", "Being rich doesn\u2019t automatically make you smart.", "I know many wealthy folks in city who rent but are millionaires. They own multiple properties they rent out. They just don't want to own their home.  But it's still suspect that a guy making 800k would argue about 3.5k", "He's obviously been there in the past, and welcomed, she's just using language to make it sound like she was intruded on.", "You are such sad individuals. Good God, hahahaha.... I feel sorry for the lot of you. \ud83e\udd23", "Actually your example is fucking stupid as hell. As long as it's not a CRT TV, you'd basically be saying \"they don't even make Sanyo 32 inch TVs anymore, so ig here's $50 bc that TV was old as hell\". In that regard you replace it with a newer TV at the price today. \n\nYou think it would be acceptable for someone to break your fucking TV and go to the pawn shop or craigslist free section looking for some piece of shit to try and \"replace it with the same kind\"?\n\nBut that's the difference $50 can't replace exactly what they had, bc tvs aren't $50 when you go to buy one, so you give them the acceptable amount to replace it $150-200. I literally did this for my gf when we were first seeing each other, I bumped her lil tv that was old and had no remote, it fell and broke, that night I went to Walmart and got a new one that was better.\n\nBuying something from a sad family member of the dead for $40 of which she felt ZERO interest in telling the woman and trying to make it right, and then demanding a theoretical price for it is nonsense. Appraisals are theoretical whether you like it or not.\n\nHow about this...if someone threw you into the pool with your phone...would you accept a used iPhone 7 bc that's what phone you had? No. Similarly if your gf accidentally washed an old shirt in your closet that you didn't say anything about and it happened to be a TV worn by and signed by Kobe Bryant in his last season at the Lakers...would you be suing her for tens of thousands bc that's what you think it probably was worth?", "Regardless of whether she expected him, once the kid is there you don't leave them alone in a room with fragile stuff you treasure to that extent.\n\nIt's the same situation IMO. Don't leave kids alone with things they can break.", "You think being rich means 3.5k is meaningless?  I already voted that she is NTA, but obviously 3.5k is a large amount of money.\n\nThis woman herself is making 200k and still thrifting around estate sales like my grandma who grew up in the the depression era.  Obviously, they are not flippant when it comes to spending money.", "No it isn't. The stingiest, most unreasonable people I've ever met were rich. \n\nI used to work in a shop that sold personalized gifts. \n\nRegular people would buy a gift with a nice, personal message that cost ~$45 to engrave. \n\nRich people (designer clothes, snotty attitudes, giant diamonds) would buy an item and only want a date or a first name on it, because that was $6 to engrave. And they would complain about the $6 being too much! You never saw such ridiculous histrionics in your life.\n\nThat $3500 was 9.66 hours worth of work for him, just to put that in perspective. And he is absolutely going to resent that specific $3500 for the rest of his life. She's NTA, but he is going to complain about it forever.", "She was.  Her boyfriend brought over his kid without notifying her that he was going to do so.", "There's a lot of things kids can and will break. It's how you learn to be careful. As a parent, you're responsible for covering the value of them.", "No is an option, I'm sure at this point he won't be bringing his kid or himself around this stingy mf, but she could have told him no."]}
