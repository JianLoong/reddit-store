Once I buy a house in the next upcoming years is when I will bring them out. I went to an estate sale this summer and bought mostly clothes, and also a beautiful vase. I bought it for 40 dollars and it didnt look expensive to me, but another collector friend of mine saw it in the background of one of my stories and asked me where I got it from and said it looked like a vintage vase hes been looking for. I went and got it appraised and come to find out its worth 3,500 dollars. I made sure to get its authentication as well. I did leave it in my bookcase and decided to keep it as decoration even though I typically put expensive furniture/decor in my storage unit.  \n\n\nThis week my boyfriend (30M) came over and unexpectedly brought his ten year old son. He lives in NYC with his mom and he has him during the summer, but he came back to stay with my boyfriend for a bit since his mom just had a baby that was in the NICU. I didnt mind since his son is nice and has never damaged anything of mine. When his dad and I were cooking in the kitchen he was watching TV in my living room. All of a sudden I hear a crash and we run into my living room to see my new vase shattered. His son started crying saying he wanted to see a book I had in my bookshelf and saw the vase and thought it looked cool and \u201ctouched it\u201d and it fell. His dad reassured him and saying its okay he\u2019ll replace it and to make sure hes not hurt.  \n\n\nI was upset but said it was okay and kept my composure. Later I spoke to him when he came over alone and we agreed hes to pay me back. He asked me how much it is and I said its worth 3,500. He raised an eyebrow and asked how much I paid since he knows I always find things at the sales and I was honest and said 40 dollars. He told me he would pay me the 40 and I said absolutely not. Just because the woman that sold me it didn\u2019t know its true price doesn\u2019t mean I dont and if I ever sold it I would charge its appraisal worth so he needs to pay me back the appraised price. Hes not hurting for money, he makes 800k a year. I make 200k so Im not asking him to as if I dont have money, its the principle since his son broke it he should pay the appraised price. He sent me the money but was upset saying Im an asshole since I got it for so much cheaper.

I buy all my designer goods (most vintage so its amazing quality) from them and they\u2019re a hidden gem since barely any people even go to them in my area so Ive been able to find amazing things. I bought so much jewelry/clothes/furniture from estate sales that I later get appraised for thousands while I spent 300 on it max. Ive been able to find amazing things for a cheap price.  \nI love to decorate my condo with the things I buy and make sure all my extremely expensive things are kept safe in a storage unit. Once I buy a house in the next upcoming years is when I will bring them out. I went to an estate sale this summer and bought mostly clothes, and also a beautiful vase. I bought it for 40 dollars and it didnt look expensive to me, but another collector friend of mine saw it in the background of one of my stories and asked me where I got it from and said it looked like a vintage vase hes been looking for. I went and got it appraised and come to find out its worth 3,500 dollars. I made sure to get its authentication as well. I did leave it in my bookcase and decided to keep it as decoration even though I typically put expensive furniture/decor in my storage unit.  \nThis week my boyfriend (30M) came over and unexpectedly brought his ten year old son. He lives in NYC with his mom and he has him during the summer, but he came back to stay with my boyfriend for a bit since his mom just had a baby that was in the NICU. I didnt mind since his son is nice and has never damaged anything of mine. When his dad and I were cooking in the kitchen he was watching TV in my living room. All of a sudden I hear a crash and we run into my living room to see my new vase shattered. His son started crying saying he wanted to see a book I had in my bookshelf and saw the vase and thought it looked cool and \u201ctouched it\u201d and it fell. His dad reassured him and saying its okay he\u2019ll replace it and to make sure hes not hurt.  \nI was upset but said it was okay and kept my composure. Later I spoke to him when he came over alone and we agreed hes to pay me back. He asked me how much it is and I said its worth 3,500. He raised an eyebrow and asked how much I paid since he knows I always find things at the sales and I was honest and said 40 dollars. He told me he would pay me the 40 and I said absolutely not. Just because the woman that sold me it didn\u2019t know its true price doesn\u2019t mean I dont and if I ever sold it I would charge its appraisal worth so he needs to pay me back the appraised price. Hes not hurting for money, he makes 800k a year. I make 200k so Im not asking him to as if I dont have money, its the principle since his son broke it he should pay the appraised price. He sent me the money but was upset saying Im an asshole since I got it for so much cheaper. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

All valid points.\n\nBut fact still stands, 99.9% of people making six digit income will just buy everything brand new.  They won't be scrounging around estate sales.   If they want something vintage, they'll just buy from a dealer.", "I struggle to see your point.  3.5k is 3.5k, it doesn't matter how long it takes to make the money. Well, it's easy for you to point and pretend that the money comes easy and thus should be easy to spend.\n\nIf you are making 50k and you're broke, you would still be broke if you made 800k.  You'd just find new and exciting ways to waste all your money.\n\nDon't be dense.  We have recently seen a story of a lady that inherited one billion dollars.  And is still broke.  Imagine that.", "How hard is it to call your girlfriend and say hay my kids mom is in the hospital can I bring him over with me?", "Irrelevant", "The point is he's not broke. And if he is, then he will have earned the full price back by tomorrow evening. It is relatively pocket change to him. He is one of the richest people in the world.", "If you date a parent, you accept you must sometimes spend time around a kid, it's part of it. Yes, he could have fore-warned her, but it wouldn't have changed much (she could have hid the vase but then, she still couldve when her partner arrived), and depending on how often the kid is over, it would feel like stepping on eggshells to forewarn her each time that yes, he was still a parent and for whatever reason had his kid.  \n\n\nOP should 100% not be dating a parent but I would guess she is single very shortly anyways", "Yeah great.  You're a genius.  Moving on.  Please give me a day's worth of your salary.  It's nothing!  It's only a day!  Give it to me."]}
