YTA", "YTA. it isn't the woman's fault that you decided to launch an entire lawsuit without getting your facts straight. You're a monster if you keep going with things and make this woman pay for your own mistake.", "YTA. You are basically stealing from an innocent person. How about think about this. You witness a murder and accuse someone. The police arrest and charge that person based off your eye witness account. You then remember that you actually didn\u2019t see them but actually someone else is guilty but you decide to not say anything about the wrong person and they get convicted. You could have stopped an innocent person from being harmed but you are selfish and trying not to take responsibility for your mistake", "YTA. This is so asinine. You\u2019re suing an innocent person and then blame her for not being more clear. You\u2019re honestly awful.", "Info- If say you win the lawsuit against that innocent person and ruin her life and she then does what many desperate and broken people do and kill herself and kill her children would you even feel guilty or are you just a uncaring robot?", "so you will take money from a single mom who you know did not wrong you so you can pay for your attorney knowing again, that he is hiding evidence. How can you not be the ah?", "YTA- suck you hired an expensive lawyer but why is that your ex-friends problem? If you continue suing after knowing she is innocent then you are a piece of work.", "YTA, and so is your lawyer, who should be disbarred!", "How are people like this? I mean, seriously, how are people like this and think like this? Absolutely awful. Let me reword this for you, OP: I sued a former business partner but found out that she is not culpable, found evidence that she is not culpable, presented evidence that she is not culpable to the one gateway that I have for legal ramifications and they advise that I should proceed because they will make money off of the action. Am I the AHOLE or am I the largest AHOLE ever? Oh, by the way, she's a single mom and experiencing some hard times but, hey, it's not from anything I did. (but it really will be so suck it). My goodness, YTA YTA YTA. Not just YTA but an awful human being.", "Reasons I did not want to become a lawyer anymore", "I\u2019m honestly so shocked\u2026. like I\u2019ve seen some laughable shit on here but this is downright the most blatant and direct fuckery I\u2019ve every seen. \n\nLike bro *literally* admits he messed up and has the audacity to ask if he\u2019s an AH \ud83d\udc80", "He\u2019s on Reddit asking if this is really wrong. Dude is already lost", "Attorneys only lose their license for stealing money from their clients and defrauding the federal government.", "Of course it would be faster to continue, but your lawyer and yourself are definitely assholes. Switch the person you are suing based on new evidence and ride it out. Report your lawyer and get another lawyer.\n\nYou wanting to still pursue suing a woman who has done nothing wrong snd potentially destroying her entire life is absolutely disgusting.", "What the actual fuck is wrong with you? I mean, do you need psychiatric evaluation? You're suing her for something someone else has done? All you care about is covering costs? Does it not matter to you the stress you're putting on this woman? I don't know how the law works there, but if you win, wouldn't that be a permanent mark on that woman? \n\nYou should probably see a psychiatrist and stay away from society until they determine that everything's good with you.\n\nBut for now YTA", "No, no they wouldn't.  You are being an idiot, an ass and have zero morals. I'm appalled that any human would do this. Unbelievable", "now i\u2019m not a lawyer but that sounds like blackmail", "Jesus christ, are you a monster?", "The more comments of yours I see, the less I believe you had nothing to do with the situation you're claiming is everyone else's fault. You don't seem to have very wise ideas or make particularly logical decisions. You definitely seem to be lacking in the ethics department.", "So you sued her because you perceived *her* to be the one to wrong you legally and ethnically, yet you found evidence clearing her and you're here asking if you should.... wrong her legally and ethically? YTA", "The fact you're considering suing someone who isn't responsible for the reason you want to sue them and then are trying to justify that well she minorly wronged you somehow... I'm so happy for her she's your EX friend. You went and accused her and based on how unorganized you appear to be and the fact you had no concrete evidence, you sound like you aren't good with accountability and would be a shitty friend (no wonder she got defensive and didn't want to prove herself to you or whatever tf you wanted). Don't sue her. YTA and please just leave this woman alone. Sue the other other if you must... Then maybe lay off trying to sue people for awhile."]}
