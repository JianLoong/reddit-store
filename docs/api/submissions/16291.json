We have 3 girls, Oldest (15F) is my partners from a past relationship, middle (10F) is mine from a previous relationship and the youngest (1F) is ours together.\n\nWe have planned a family outing to a music festival with all the kids. Unfortunately due to being unavailable to get time off work I, and my daughter can not go. I explained to my partner that we could have a week away together instead at an alternate date. My partner has informed me that she and her eldest will be going still...\n\nI have said that is fine, but when I can, I shall book a week off to take our youngest and my daughter for a week away instead. This has not gone down well as \"I am being spiteful going without her and her daughter (15F), I have stated that it is double standards for her to want to go to the music festival without myself, my daughter and our daughter, yet if I wish to do the same it is \"spiteful\"?\n\nI had originally suggested a week away instead of the music festival for all of us, and attending the music festival next year as a family, but my partner has stated her and her daughter are going. \n\nObviously I am bloody gutted I can't go, it was me who introduced my partner to said festival. I have spoken to my partner and advised I am quite miffed that she has decided to go instead of us having a family holiday together.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to take the two kids who are missing out away?\n\nEDIT: i will not be showing her this post, this is just for clarification on my end.\n\n                                                      **UPDATE**\n\nWe have no resolved our issues after a phone call. Laid my cards on the table as did she. \n\nWe have agreed to a weeks holiday together as a family and will be going to the festival next year instead (Bonus to this is it gives us 15 months to save up so we can have an absolute blast next year without money worries)\n\nAs a compromise, following comments I have seen from people as well regarding my partner spending quality time with her daughter, I have offered to use holiday time at work to book time off to have the 1 year old so my partner and her 15 year old daughter can spend time alone together to do their own thing together, whether it be a day shopping, cinema or even just hanging round the house in their PJs watching films together.\n\nI appreciate every comment on here wether it be YTA or NTA as it helped me gain some perspective on the situation from neutral perspectives rather than through only my eyes :)", "created_utc": 1683123364, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136m80i/aita_for_wanting_a_holiday_wothout_my_partner/", "score": 386, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anyone calling OP spiteful needs to get off reddit for a few hours and touch some grass. They are going for a festival that you and your daughter cannot attend, so you decided to do something with other daughter on a different date. I don\u2019t see spitefulness. I see trying to be fair. Why would it be fair for wife and daughter to do 2 events/ vacations while OP and other daughter can only do 1? Why can\u2019t wife compromise? OP offered a week for them ALL to get away as a family and was shut down. Make it make sense.", "NTA. I think booking an alternative holiday with the family members who can't go is equitable.  I also think that no one going and rescheduling everyone for next year is also quite fair.  You are trying to compromise but your partner does not think a compromise is necessary, why?", "NTA", "NTA - Your headline is misleading.  Wanting to take time away because your partner is insisting on going to the festival without you does not make you TA.  It actually makes you the fair one for trying to balance this out.  Your partner is clearly TA here.  Your attempt to do something different as a family and go next year is exactly what you should be doing as a family.", "NTA. You\u2019re trying to make sure the other kids get to have a fun experience too. Talk about double standards", "So you & your daughter cannot go to festival. Your wife & her daughter are going to still attend so you said... you\u2019re planning a trip without wife & her daughter because why now?\n\nWhy can\u2019t wife & daughter go to both the festival & family vacation? Because you can\u2019t attend festival doesn\u2019t mean everyone should miss out. \n\nYou\u2019re essentially punishing your wife & her daughter for not getting your way. That is not a good lesson to be teaching your kids.\n\nSeems like YTA", "Quick question, why can't the 10 year old go? I understand not wanting to take the 1 year old and being the only parent but why can't she take 10? That sounds a bit selfish.", "Info: why isn't the daughter able to go?\n\nAnd yes, YTA. You planned to go to the festival with the whole family. You can't make it, and now you either do not want her to go, or will go on a holiday without her later?\n\nHow about you all go on a holiday together AND she and the daughters go to the festival. Why are you insisting on going without her?", "INFO: how long will they be gone for the music festival?", "YTA. You are being spiteful. It wasn\u2019t that you weren\u2019t invited, you just couldn\u2019t go. It would be one thing to plan something and then still going when your wife couldn\u2019t but to purposely exclude her and a 15 year old girl because you\u2019re jealous you can\u2019t go is just immature.", "It sounds like you\u2019re both feeling spiteful, tbh. \n\nYou for not going, and her for you deciding to go off without her. \n\nShe most likely just wants to spend some time with you, but you\u2019re both being defensive and passive aggressive towards each other instead of sitting down and communicating properly to find a real solution. \n\nESH", "YTA\n\nI don't know what the parenting arrangements are in regards to your children from previous relationships but I can understand your partner not being able to solely watch 3 children (including a 1 year old) alone at a music festival. I am confused as to why if you are unable to attend your 10 year old couldn't go with your partner if another trusted adult accompanied them? Just because you are not able to get work off doesn't mean your kids need to miss out. \n\nThe reason I say you're the AH is because your partner extended the invitation, was excited to make this a family trip with everyone involved and then just because you can't make it you then decide to arrange a trip excluding only her and her daughter. That *is* spiteful. Your partner did not arrange the festival trip out of spite - you just can't make it. Life happens and sometimes you have to miss out. She did not exclude you or your child like you are excluding her and her child. \n\nIf finances aren't an issue then I wonder why it has to be either/or, and why you can't do both?\n\nI guess those are my questions:\n\n\\- Why can't you do both?\n\n\\- Why can't your 10 year old at least attend the festival without you?\n\nAlso, why do you think you have ownership over this festival just because you showed it to your partner? It comes across as though you don't want anyone to go and enjoy just because you're annoyed you can't attend. \n\nTL/DR: YTA because your partner invited you and your child but you cannot come so now no-one is allowed to go? You then retaliate by planning a holiday that excludes your partner and her child out of spite.", "YTA Why shouldn\u2019t your wife go? And why can\u2019t she take your daughter? And why can\u2019t you ALL go on the camping trip?  You def need to develop some empathy and work towards wanting your loved ones to have a great life. It sucks you can\u2019t go but work life can be like that. In the meanwhile learn how to have joy for the people who share your life and you will receive that love back multiplied.", "YTA because you are doing it out of spite. Wanting to make it up to the two who can't go is not bad, but if you are mad because now there is no family togetherness vacation YOU aren't doing anything to rectify that.", "It does sound like your main reason is spite, yes. And over something that is not even her fault.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIt's not your wife's fault you can't go to the music festival. Just because you can't go, doesn't mean she and your oldest can't go. \n\nYou've clearly planned this second trip and excluded them out of a spite.\n\nGrow up.", "YTA You can\u2019t go to the music festival for reasons outside of your wife\u2019s control, while you are purposefully excluding her and her daughter from the other, longer trip. Yes, it\u2019s spiteful to offer that they can only go on that trip if they cancel the festival. There\u2019s no reason why they can\u2019t do both, while there\u2019s a reason why you can\u2019t attend the festival. You could still ask her about taking your daughter though, in case she\u2019d want to go. And if you wanted to bond just with your daughters, that\u2019s fine too, but not on a trip you offered to take your wife and her daughter on too.", "NTA.  Your wife and her daughter get to spend bonding time together, why can't you spend bonding time with your daughter?", "YTA, why can't your wife and her daughter go and have some time to themselves. I'm sure the 15 yr  old would appreciate some alone time with just mum.", "You are acting like an asshole, you shouldn't be controlling your kids on what they want to do.", "YTA.

Bummer.\nWife and eldest child decide to still go. Sounds like a fun bonding time (and let's be honest, Wife probably doesn't have that many years left of eldest wanting to hang with her mom).\nYou get spiteful and decide \"well if you're doing this without me, then I'm doing that without you!\" instead of being a little bummed but understanding that it's important Wife and eldest get to spend time together without you and the younger kids...\nYTA.", "ESH.  Neither of you are being fair to any of the kids.", "NTA. That\u2019s an entirely reasonable compromise. It\u2019s not fair to the two youngest girls to miss out simply because you can\u2019t go and mom won\u2019t take them all herself. \n\nIgnore anyone here that uses the word spite in their judgment of you.", "NTA... My husband asks me when I'm going to take my trip after he traveled with a friend to see a game. \nI might go on a short repositioning cruise w a friend.", "NTA.\n\nWhat's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.

Then you can do a full family vacation as well. Granted, this gets expensive, so you might have to choose a less expensive option for the solo trip.\n\nI get your frustration but you will probably have to let it go. Good luck!", "yes.", "How I\u2019m seeing it is that, although not getting days off isn\u2019t entirely your fault, it\u2019s more so yours than your wife\u2019s and stepdaughter\u2019s. If you knew this is a yearly festival, you could have scheduled time off earlier. Either way, none of that is your wife or kids\u2019 fault so why shouldn\u2019t they go. About the kids: taking a 1 year old to a music festival can be a lot of hassle, especially for just 1 adult. And either way, the 1 year old wouldn\u2019t remember anything in a few years, her brain\u2019s not forming memories yet. From your comments, you\u2019re the one not wanting the 10 year old to go, because you\u2019re not wanting to lose custody time with her. Again, that\u2019s not your wife\u2019s fault either, you\u2019re the one keeping the 10 year old from biting into that symbolic \u2018apple\u2019 that you talk about. Going on an alternative trip just with your kids is fine, as I said earlier, however in this case you at first suggested the trip as a family trip, with the condition that your wife and stepdaughter don\u2019t go on the other trip. So yes, the whole conditions thing is spiteful on its own. If you want bonding time just for you and your daughters, then you just tell your wife that you want to do x thing/take them x place. If you say \u2018but you could come if you do x/y\u2019 that\u2019s spiteful and manipulative, and defeats the purpose of the trip/activity from the get go.", "You\u2019re looking at this in a very short-sighted way. You have decades ahead of raising all of these children, and hopefully of time together with your partner. I think the saying that applies here is \u201cit all comes out in the wash\u201d. Your priority should be quality time with everyone, as much as possible. It sounds like your current priority is \u201cgetting even\u201d because you\u2019re jealous that your partner and child get to go to a music festival and you don\u2019t. Be happy for them, and ALSO plan a family trip, and maybe ALSO plan some one on one time with the other kids. These things are not mutually exclusive.", "> Why should my partner and her daughter get two bites at the apple, whereas the other two kids only get one?\n\nThis is literally spite. It's not your wife's fault that you can't go to the festival.", "But why would wife and her daughter get to go on two trips? Sounds like she wants her cake and to eat it too.", "That passive aggressive smiley face is not going to help.", "Except that he ISN'T looking at it as bonding time. He's looking at it as \"you excluded me so I'm excluding you\". If he'd framed it as \"wife and eldest having bonding time made me realize that perhaps some dad and kids bonding time would be a good idea, too\" I'd have voted differently.", "I never said it wasn't. But his motivation is crummy. He didn't say \"oh, that's nice you get to bond with eldest, maybe I should do the same with the other kids\" instead it was \"well you're doing this without me so I'm doing that without you\".", "But this trip was suggested as a family trip in the first place, albeit with conditions (that is if stepdaughter and wife don\u2019t go to the festival). Which is both spiteful and manipulative, and defeats the whole purpose of father-daughter bonding, because if he truly wanted that, he wouldn\u2019t have extended a conditional invitation to wife and stepdaughter. And have you read OP\u2019s comments? He\u2019s the one not wanting 10 year old to go with wife, and about the 1 year old, let\u2019s be honest, she\u2019s really not going to mind not going to a festival when she was 1 and couldn\u2019t even form long time memories yet.", "I do plan to call and talk it over when I finish work.

She\u2019s definitely the AH. She\u2019s being selfish by not choosing a family trip they can all go on rather than just her and her daughter going to a festival (where normally they would all go, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a trip planned specifically FOR just her and her daughter to \u201cbond\u201d. )", "Fair point.", "I feel that, lol.

So her bio mom probably takes her places where her step-sibling and half-sibling don\u2019t go? Either way, OP doesn\u2019t say he asked the wife about taking 10 year old, he said he doesn\u2019t want her to go because he would be losing from the little custody time he has.

Have you ever had multiple kids and tried giving one of them extra and the bother one not as much? It\u2019s not fair, it creates resentment, and they will definitely fight about it.

She COULD potentially take 10F on the trip, but that would take away from OP's time with his daughter, as he shares custody with another parent.

He's upset that she wants to go when he can't, how dare she. They could have still gone on a family trip.
