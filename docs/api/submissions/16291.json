Anyone calling OP spiteful needs to get off reddit for a few hours and touch some grass. They are going for a festival that you and your daughter cannot attend, so you decided to do something with other daughter on a different date. I don\u2019t see spitefulness. I see trying to be fair. Why would it be fair for wife and daughter to do 2 events/ vacations while OP and other daughter can only do 1? Why can\u2019t wife compromise? OP offered a week for them ALL to get away as a family and was shut down. Make it make sense.", "NTA. I think booking an alternative holiday with the family members who can't go is equitable.  I also think that no one going and rescheduling everyone for next year is also quite fair.  You are trying to compromise but your partner does not think a compromise is necessary, why?", "NTA", "NTA - Your headline is misleading.  Wanting to take time away because your partner is insisting on going to the festival without you does not make you TA.  It actually makes you the fair one for trying to balance this out.  Your partner is clearly TA here.  Your attempt to do something different as a family and go next year is exactly what you should be doing as a family.", "NTA. You\u2019re trying to make sure the other kids get to have a fun experience too. Talk about double standards", "So you & your daughter cannot go to festival. Your wife & her daughter are going to still attend so you said... you\u2019re planning a trip without wife & her daughter because why now?\n\nWhy can\u2019t wife & daughter go to both the festival & family vacation? Because you can\u2019t attend festival doesn\u2019t mean everyone should miss out. \n\nYou\u2019re essentially punishing your wife & her daughter for not getting your way. That is not a good lesson to be teaching your kids.\n\nSeems like YTA", "Quick question, why can't the 10 year old go? I understand not wanting to take the 1 year old and being the only parent but why can't she take 10? That sounds a bit selfish.", "Info: why isn't the daughter able to go?\n\nAnd yes, YTA. You planned to go to the festival with the whole family. You can't make it, and now you either do not want her to go, or will go on a holiday without her later?\n\nHow about you all go on a holiday together AND she and the daughters go to the festival. Why are you insisting on going without her?", "INFO: how long will they be gone for the music festival?", "YTA. You are being spiteful. It wasn\u2019t that you weren\u2019t invited, you just couldn\u2019t go. It would be one thing to plan something and then still going when your wife couldn\u2019t but to purposely exclude her and a 15 year old girl because you\u2019re jealous you can\u2019t go is just immature.", "It sounds like you\u2019re both feeling spiteful, tbh. \n\nYou for not going, and her for you deciding to go off without her. \n\nShe most likely just wants to spend some time with you, but you\u2019re both being defensive and passive aggressive towards each other instead of sitting down and communicating properly to find a real solution. \n\nESH", "YTA\n\nI don't know what the parenting arrangements are in regards to your children from previous relationships but I can understand your partner not being able to solely watch 3 children (including a 1 year old) alone at a music festival. I am confused as to why if you are unable to attend your 10 year old couldn't go with your partner if another trusted adult accompanied them? Just because you are not able to get work off doesn't mean your kids need to miss out. \n\nThe reason I say you're the AH is because your partner extended the invitation, was excited to make this a family trip with everyone involved and then just because you can't make it you then decide to arrange a trip excluding only her and her daughter. That *is* spiteful. Your partner did not arrange the festival trip out of spite - you just can't make it. Life happens and sometimes you have to miss out. She did not exclude you or your child like you are excluding her and her child. \n\nIf finances aren't an issue then I wonder why it has to be either/or, and why you can't do both?\n\nI guess those are my questions:\n\n\\- Why can't you do both?\n\n\\- Why can't your 10 year old at least attend the festival without you?\n\nAlso, why do you think you have ownership over this festival just because you showed it to your partner? It comes across as though you don't want anyone to go and enjoy just because you're annoyed you can't attend. \n\nTL/DR: YTA because your partner invited you and your child but you cannot come so now no-one is allowed to go? You then retaliate by planning a holiday that excludes your partner and her child out of spite.", "YTA Why shouldn\u2019t your wife go? And why can\u2019t she take your daughter? And why can\u2019t you ALL go on the camping trip?  You def need to develop some empathy and work towards wanting your loved ones to have a great life. It sucks you can\u2019t go but work life can be like that. In the meanwhile learn how to have joy for the people who share your life and you will receive that love back multiplied.", "YTA because you are doing it out of spite. Wanting to make it up to the two who can't go is not bad, but if you are mad because now there is no family togetherness vacation YOU aren't doing anything to rectify that.", "It does sound like your main reason is spite, yes. And over something that is not even her fault.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIt's not your wife's fault you can't go to the music festival. Just because you can't go, doesn't mean she and your oldest can't go. \n\nYou've clearly planned this second trip and excluded them out of a spite.\n\nGrow up.", "YTA You can\u2019t go to the music festival for reasons outside of your wife\u2019s control, while you are purposefully excluding her and her daughter from the other, longer trip. Yes, it\u2019s spiteful to offer that they can only go on that trip if they cancel the festival. There\u2019s no reason why they can\u2019t do both, while there\u2019s a reason why you can\u2019t attend the festival. You could still ask her about taking your daughter though, in case she\u2019d want to go. And if you wanted to bond just with your daughters, that\u2019s fine too, but not on a trip you offered to take your wife and her daughter on too.", "NTA.  Your wife and her daughter get to spend bonding time together, why can't you spend bonding time with your daughter?", "YTA, why can't your wife and her daughter go and have some time to themselves. I'm sure the 15 yr  old would appreciate some alone time with just mum.", "You are acting like an asshole, you shouldn't be controlling your kids on what they want to do.", "YTA.

Bummer.\nWife and eldest child decide to still go. Sounds like a fun bonding time (and let's be honest, Wife probably doesn't have that many years left of eldest wanting to hang with her mom).\nYou get spiteful and decide \"well if you're doing this without me, then I'm doing that without you!\" instead of being a little bummed but understanding that it's important Wife and eldest get to spend time together without you and the younger kids...\nYTA.", "ESH.  Neither of you are being fair to any of the kids.", "NTA. That\u2019s an entirely reasonable compromise.

Good luck!", "yes.", "How I\u2019m seeing it is that, although not getting days off isn\u2019t entirely your fault, it\u2019s more so yours than your wife\u2019s and stepdaughter\u2019s. If you knew this is a yearly festival, you could have scheduled time off earlier. Either way, none of that is your wife or kids\u2019 fault so why shouldn\u2019t they go. About the kids: taking a 1 year old to a music festival can be a lot of hassle, especially for just 1 adult. And either way, the 1 year old wouldn\u2019t remember anything in a few years, her brain\u2019s not forming memories yet. From your comments, you\u2019re the one not wanting the 10 year old to go, because you\u2019re not wanting to lose custody time with her. Again, that\u2019s not your wife\u2019s fault either, you\u2019re the one keeping the 10 year old from biting into that symbolic \u2018apple\u2019 that you talk about. Going on an alternative trip just with your kids is fine, as I said earlier, however in this case you at first suggested the trip as a family trip, with the condition that your wife and stepdaughter don\u2019t go on the other trip. So yes, the whole conditions thing is spiteful on its own. If you want bonding time just for you and your daughters, then you just tell your wife that you want to do x thing/take them x place. If you say \u2018but you could come if you do x/y\u2019 that\u2019s spiteful and manipulative, and defeats the purpose of the trip/activity from the get go.", "You\u2019re looking at this in a very short-sighted way. You have decades ahead of raising all of these children, and hopefully of time together with your partner. I think the saying that applies here is \u201cit all comes out in the wash\u201d. Your priority should be quality time with everyone, as much as possible. It sounds like your current priority is \u201cgetting even\u201d because you\u2019re jealous that your partner and child get to go to a music festival and you don\u2019t. Be happy for them, and ALSO plan a family trip, and maybe ALSO plan some one on one time with the other kids. These things are not mutually exclusive.", "> Why should my partner and her daughter get two bites at the apple, whereas the other two kids only get one?\n\nThis is literally spite. It's not your wife's fault that you can't go to the festival.", "But why would wife and her daughter get to go on two trips? Sounds like she wants her cake and to eat it too.", "That passive aggressive smiley face is not going to help.", "Except that he ISN'T looking at it as bonding time. He's looking at it as \"you excluded me so I'm excluding you\". If he'd framed it as \"wife and eldest having bonding time made me realize that perhaps some dad and kids bonding time would be a good idea, too\" I'd have voted differently.", "I never said it wasn't.

He didn't say \"oh, that's nice you get to bond with eldest, maybe I should do the same with the other kids\" instead it was \"well you're doing this without me so I'm doing that without you\".", "But this trip was suggested as a family trip in the first place, albeit with conditions (that is if stepdaughter and wife don\u2019t go to the festival). Which is both spiteful and manipulative, and defeats the whole purpose of father-daughter bonding, because if he truly wanted that, he wouldn\u2019t have extended a conditional invitation to wife and stepdaughter. And have you read OP\u2019s comments? He\u2019s the one not wanting 10 year old to go with wife, and about the 1 year old, let\u2019s be honest, she\u2019s really not going to mind not going to a festival when she was 1 and couldn\u2019t even form long time memories yet.", "I do plan to call and talk it over when I finish work.

AND he\u2019s willing to take the 1YO with him as well so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s leaving the baby with his wife. ETA: he offered an alternate trip for everyone to go on and wife declined. She\u2019s definitely the AH. She\u2019s being selfish by not choosing a family trip they can all go on rather than just her and her daughter going to a festival (where normally they would all go, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a trip planned specifically FOR just her and her daughter to \u201cbond\u201d. )", "Fair point.", "I feel that, lol.

Not everything can be 100% equal in a situation like this.", "But that\u2019s her stepdaughter, and her biological mom has custody of her the majority of the time? So her bio mom probably takes her places where her step-sibling and half-sibling don\u2019t go? Either way, OP doesn\u2019t say he asked the wife about taking 10 year old, he said he doesn\u2019t want her to go because he would be losing from the little custody time he has.

Have you ever had multiple kids and tried giving one of them extra and the bother one not as much? It\u2019s not fair, it creates resentment, and they will definitely fight about it.

She COULD potentially take 10F on the trip, but that would take away from OP's time with his daughter, as he shares custody with another parent.

He's upset that she wants to go when he can't, how dare she. They could have still gone on a family trip.

Only her teenager at home, or by herself, if daughter is with her dad. If that's the case she can have a whole f'ing weekend for herself, relaxing and pampering herself at home. HOW is this a bad deal for her? How are you being spiteful? \n\nNTA", "NTA what\u2019s good for the Goose is good for the gander", "Info: is there a reason you don\u2019t want her and her daughter to join for the later trip? It is understandable that you are disappointed that you couldn\u2019t make this trip work, but why not have the next one be scheduled for when it works for you and your daughters then if your wife is able to join she can still attend?", "This is it!", ">why can't your wife and her daughter go and have some time to themselves\n\nOP isn't blocking them from going, he's just saying that then he and the 10yo will go and get some time to *them*selves to make it even. i'm sure the 10yo will appreciate some alone time with just dad the same way.", "Are you the wife?", "Sure, thankfully not OP\u2019s though.", "And I feel like the wife is being a greedy guts who wants two vacations.  Who knows who is right?", "And did you miss the part where he said why he didn't want the 10 yr old to go with his wife?\n\n>I don't think it would be fair to expect my partner to look after my 10 year old for the whole weekend :)", "Why is it greedy to go on 2 vacations if she can afford it? Anyways, it\u2019s a yearly festival that they\u2019ve been going to, so OP knew he needed time off and didn\u2019t schedule it in time. The more I think about it the more of an asshole he is.", "I don't get that. You can give your family one or two happy memories, and you're deciding to turn it into a fight instead. \n\nAlso, no way on Earth you would be taking my 1 year old kid without me on a week long trip where I can't go only *because you say so*.", "She\u2019s greedy because she\u2019s insisting she gets a solo vacation and he does not.  She\u2019s watching out for her own bottom line.  So interesting that you see the person clutching at both things as the victim and the guy who has to work and just wants an equivalent opportunity for himself and the other kids as the grubby one.", "OP was stupid enough not to request time off for a trip well in advance, although he literally had a year to do so. Everyone was excited for the festival, but OP can\u2019t go because he hadn\u2019t requested time off early enough. Now OP is saying his 10 year old bio daughter cannot go to the festival either, because it\u2019s his custody time (that he barely has anyways) and cannot lose it. No mention whether 10 year old would have liked to go without her dad, or whether wife would take the 10 year old to the festival. Judging from the post and the rest of OP\u2019s actions, he would have pointed it out if wife was excluding 10 year old or if 10 year old didn\u2019t want to go without OP. Now OP can\u2019t go, he\u2019s stopped 10 year old from going, and wants to prevent wife and stepdaughter from going too, so he says they can all go on a family trip together IF wife and 15F don\u2019t go to the festival. Wife says they would still like to go to the festival either way. So now OP says that then they aren\u2019t invited to the family vacation and he\u2019s only taking 10F and 1F. That is both spiteful and manipulative. This is what I\u2019m seeing and what comes through from the post and especially from OP\u2019s comments.", "Okay.  I see it differently but it is what it is.", "Unless money is the issue meaning it is a situation where you either go to the festival OR the holiday, I\u2019d be pleased for my partner and 15F to have that experience (obviously wishing I could join them) and would enjoy having them join us for the next family holiday. In fact I have a similar situation this year, I\u2019m starting a new job so will be missing the first 2 days of a festival (we originally bought early bird tickets) while my husband and daughter go. We will all be going on our next holiday together - it\u2019s not their fault that I can\u2019t get time off work from my new job.", "NTA, but be prepared as a 1 yo could be quite a handful on a camping trip.", "YTA", "NTA enjoy", "NTA, she wants special treatment and is not going to let you get any of the sort.  Don't tolerate this BS.  Pay her back in full.", "NTA\n\nYou getting a trip with your daughters seems like a good balance. I would stick to your initial suggestion there.", "NTA. Holy C. People, get a grip.", "NTA you should be able to take time off with your kids too. It's only fair", "NTA but I think it\u2019s really weird you\u2019re having this argument. \n\nMy husband and I would never resent the other taking the kids away if the other can\u2019t go, but also would be delighted if we could both make it. \n\nDo you not like each other?", "Family activities don't have a balance sheet.\n\nIf OP can't go, he can't go. That's not anyone else's fault. Why can't his wife and her daughter still go AND go on the family outing?\n\nIf I can't do something, I don't tell my wife and kids they can't go or it \"won't be fair\". It's not their fault I can't make it.", "She doesn't like the idea of him taking a different trip without her and HER daughter...which is being double standard on her part...it's ok for her and her daughter to go to the music festival but not for him...sorry OP, I'd still plan a trip without those two...you're NTA", "This is what pushes me towards E S H. Wanting another trip is fine. Wanting a trip to exclude them as revenge is petty. It\u2019s not a scoreboard.", "We took our diddy one to the same music festival last year when she was 6 month old, I was the one who got cold feet but the missus convinced me to try and it was an absolute dream! \ud83e\udd23 We have both commented how lucky we are with our youngest and how laid back she is! As long as her belly is full   she is happy! The people camping around us for the first couple of days didn't even realise that we had a baby with us \ud83e\udd23", "The post very much reads as because I can't go, nobody should go. \n\nI'm confused by the attitude of, because some are going even though I can't go, I'm going to do something else and not invite them. It is spiteful. You can't go because of work, so why should they be denied? OP is purposely excluding them, whereas, OP wasn't purposely excluded.", "He is preventing his own daughter from going. YTA!", "Why are you calling him ta...he couldn't get off work. He tried to  compromise by canceling the festival this year and going next year or have a family vacation some other time, but it wasn't good enough for her...she gets all mad because he's taken the two youngest and not her and her daughter?..\n She's TA", "But why would you take a 1yr old to a music festival? That makes zero sense.", "I totally agree. People saying \u201cbut it\u2019s equitable\u201d, no, relationships aren\u2019t transactional. Trying to \u201cbe even or fair\u201d makes it seem like a score sheet. That\u2019s not how it should work. They already made the plans so I don\u2019t see why those who can attend do, and then do a family thing together. Keeping score is yuck.", "Rather than assuming, why don\u2019t you give her the choice? Assuming stepdad is willing to take care of 2 kids (which is perfectly reasonable at their ages)", "It's very lucky. 1 year olds can be quite unpredictable, my 1yo boy is quite the adventurer. Just be aware that handling a child that young, along with the older one, could be stressful, especially being the only adult there \ud83d\ude05.", "He COULDN\u2019T go to the festival. That\u2019s not her fault. Why should that stop her from going? She CAN go to his trip - but he disinvinted her cause he\u2019s mad about the festival? Petty AF. How does it hurt him if she goes to two fun things?!? I would want my spouse to do fun things, money and time permitting.", "Why can\u2019t they all bond together?", "I agree that's weird.\n\nAnd why won't his wife take the 10 yo? Seems like a fun girls' night.\n\nSomething hinky about his story, but still spiteful to try and intentionally leave them home just because he can't make this one.", "That\u2019s also cutting into his custody time with the 10 ur old", "What does the reason matter? She gets to go on a trip with her daughter, and he gets to go on a trip with his daughter. What\u2019s the issue? The reasoning is less important than the outcome. Both of them get to spend alone time with their respective children.", "The 10 year old is my own daughter from a previous relationship. She lives with her mum. The plan was for me to pick 10 year old up and attend the festival with her. \n\nAnd to be honest we took the 1 year old with us last year (6 months old at the time) and it was absolutely amazing. The 1 year old is the most vhilled and laid back baby I have ever know. She loved the lights etc (Obviously had ear defenders on!)", "Sometimes it isn\u2019t about black and white concepts of fairness, sometimes it is about getting as much family time together as possible, especially with the age differences of your daughters. Just something to consider.", "If your daughter lives with her mom, then I really don't see any issues here.\n\nWhy can't your wife and her daughter go do something fun just because you can't go?", "\u201cThe 10 year old is my child from a previous relationship who I have custody of alternate weekends and half of holidays, if my partner takes her, it means I wouldn't see my own daughter over that weekend at all.\u201d And did you miss this one right after? :) It\u2019s not that the kid doesn\u2019t want to go or that the wife doesn\u2019t want to take her, but OP doesn\u2019t want to lose custody time with her. Which is understandable to some extent, because he already has very little time with her. But he should have put it in the OP because many people started assuming that it was the wife excluding the 10 year old and wanting to only take bio daughter.", "Thankfully it is \"our\" one year old..\n\nThere is no \"her\" daughter or \"my\" daughter when it comes to \"our\" one year old \ud83d\ude42\n\nThat could also be flipped the other way in the fact that \"I can't take my our 1 year old away because she says so\" \ud83d\ude42", "The 10 year old is mine from a previous relationship.

The issue is now sorted, we have spoken on the phone and we have decided to have a holiday toegther with the 5 of us. \n\nI am going to offer to have our 1 year old for a weekend at some point in the near future so my partner can have quality time alone with her 15 year old, wether it be a day out shopping or going to a spa day etc etc.. or even just having a PJ day and watching films \ud83d\ude42", "he doesn\u2019t have a problem with them going but wife says him and his daughter can\u2019t go out by themselves which is honestly probably what\u2019s needed. his daughter doesn\u2019t get him all the time like the other two do so they need one on one time", "Have you existed in the world? It\u2019s not fair, one day they may be the ones able to go and not the other. Why can\u2019t mom and kid who can go still go and then they can all go together when they can all go. It\u2019s not all or nothing.", "Right, and you can't take a one year old away without the consent of the other parent. If you have the veto power to decide she and 15f can't come on the holiday, surely she has the veto power to say 1f isn't going either?", "Yeah I know that from previous comments, but that means it\u2019s ultimately your decision for her not to go. Your wife isn\u2019t excluding her like you\u2019re doing with your stepdaughter.", "So they're not going to the festival?\nETA: how sad. 'I'll let my partner have some quality time with her daughter, just not in the way she would like to'.", "I\u2019m glad you guys reached an agreement. Fairness is so important for kids, but it also can be a trap that if you focus too much on a perfect concept of \u201cfair\u201d you miss out on so much. The priority is less about \u201cfairness\u201d and more about how to make everyone in the family feel loved and supported and valued.", "No, his wife says that him specifically planning a trip and excluding her is spiteful, which it is.\n\nHe wanted a family trip, not one on one time with his daughter. He can still have that, but is refusing it solely because his wife is going to a festival that he can't go to.\n\nIf he wanted special time with his daughter, he wouldn't have been planning a family trip to the music festival.", "if wife and her daughter already got a trip why can\u2019t him and his daughter have a trip too ?"]}
