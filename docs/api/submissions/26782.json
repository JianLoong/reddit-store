{"id": 26782, "submission_id": "16hu0nr", "title": "AITA for forcing my 17 year old to share.a room with her 12 year old sister?", "selftext": "This is mostly about my oldest daughter Maya (17f) and her younger sister Chloe (12f). Maya has never had a room of her own. We had very little money through her childhood, so she slept with us as a baby/ toddler, then shared with our son (15m) from the ages of 3-9 when we started renting a larger 2-bed house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the time Maya was 9, it was no longer appropriate to have mixed genders sharing. We moved into a 3-bed house, we gave our son the smallest room in the house, and the girls shared the largest room. It admittedly wasn\u2019t particularly big (definitely no space for a partition wall etc.) but had space for both their beds, drawers, books etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaya was initially frustrated because, when Chloe was 4-6ish, she would throw massive tantrums and scream all night about going to bed, keeping Maya awake, but she has obviously aged out of that and the girls seemed fairly content sharing through Maya\u2019s tween years. We thought this was a very normal, healthy, situation, especially since my wife shared with her own younger sister until she moved out the house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the time Maya was 15, we were in a much better financial position and were able to purchase a house. We could potentially have afforded a larger house (to claify), however, we really liked the house we were already renting, so we bought a house which was absolutely identical around the corner (it\u2019s an ex-council estate so lots of similar houses).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaya was very excited about the move and had assumed we would buy a house where she could have her own bedroom, and was incredibly angry when she found out we had bought an identical house. She\u2019s now studying for her final exams and is constantly angry and arguing about her lack of privacy/ study space and having to share a room with a \u201cchild\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer biggest complaints are not being able to have friends stay over, not being allowed to have the lights or her phone on or make noise in the room past her sister\u2019s bedtime (8.30 on school nights), and Chloe going through her drawers and things (which we have absolutely warned Chloe not to do).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe do think these are valid complaints but Maya just does not seem to want to understand that her brother and sister can\u2019t share, and we can\u2019t conjure up a fourth bedroom. She\u2019ll be going away for university next year and this won\u2019t be so much of an issue anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis week, Maya got so frustrated with Chloe rooting through her clothes drawer that she threw a glass of water in her face, screamed at us that she hates us and we\u2019re terrible parents, and left the house for hours to just roam the streets. This broke our heart, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019re actually doing anything wrong by denying her her own bedroom. We thought this was a common situation for siblings, but Maya claims she\u2019s the only person in her year who has to share and it\u2019s embarrassing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694628076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hu0nr/aita_for_forcing_my_17_year_old_to_sharea_room/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not everyone can afford separate bedrooms for all the kids.  But the reality is that you could have given Maya at least a couple of years of privacy but chose not to.  Ironically, due to their ages, Chloe will get the privacy she will want during HER adolescence.  I cannot see it any other way.

You could afford a bigger house, you just chose to ignore her needs.\n\nLook, there are times when kids have to share rooms and there's no options. That's not the case here.\n\nYou decided to make them keep sharing but also turned around and bought a house where they still had to share a small room that didn't allow for individual space.\n\nYour daughter is angry because her needs keep getting shoved aside. She has no room to study, her little sister keeps going through her stuff, she isn't allowed to do anything after 8:30 PM (that's absolutely ridiculous to put on a teenager!)\n\nObviously Chloe is the golden child in the family. \n\nWhen she goes no contact with you in a few years you can look back at this post and try to figure out where you went wrong.", "YTA, but not because you have a house that doesn't have enough bedrooms.\n\n>Her biggest complaints are not being able to have friends stay over, not being allowed to have the lights or her phone on or make noise in the room past her sister\u2019s bedtime (8.30 on school nights), and Chloe going through her drawers and things (which we have absolutely warned Chloe not to do).\n\nYour teenage daughter, who is nearly an adult, brought to your attention multiple very reasonable issues with their current living conditions. They have no privacy, a ridiculous bed time, noise/light rules, lost some ability to socialize, and a sibling who is abusing their privacy without any apparent punishment or correction.\n\nWhat did you do to mitigate them?\n\nWhat are the punishments for Chloe going through your daughters private things? Pretty serious right?\n\nAre you finding ways for her to have a sleepover (for example, Chloe could come sleep in your room or on a blow up mattress once every month or two in some other space and get a perk for being considerate), or you could schedule sleepovers for Chloe at others houses or grandparents or anything else to give your eldest those opportunities. \n\nDid you buy a partition, have chloe try sleeping eye masks + white noise machines, or find other ways for your eldest to stay up or make reasonable amounts of noise after 8:30 (this was about the time I would finish my school work most nights all those years go). \n\nDid you create private areas or times for her in other spaces in the house for studying or be alone?\n\nIt just sounds like they brought a bunch of valid complaints and you said \"well that all sounds tough, good luck you'll be gone soon anyways its too late to do anything now!\" and then did nothing as parents to help. It sounds like an absolute failure of parenting. No wonder she is livid with you guys.", "I'd say YTA. Just because you said you liked the house so you bought almost the exact same house. \n\nYour daughter obviously didn't like it and you guys didn't care enough to think about her.", "YTA. So you could have purchased a bigger home with rooms to accommodate the kids but you chose not to for some reason? I\u2019m not surprised she\u2019s kissed. How about you and your husband share the room with Chloe?", "As the parent of an 11-yo and a 17-yo, YTA. \n\nYou could have moved into a larger home to accommodate all of your children. You did not. \n\nYou allow your younger daughter to go through her older sister's things with no real consequences. \n\nYou seem to consistently put your older daughter's needs last.

You now need to be the one to fix it. \n\nAnd yes, YTA", "YTA- Maya is getting understandably upset. She can't do anything she wants past 8:30, because of Chloe. Chloe is rummaging through her things and borrowing her clothes. Maya does have valid complaints.\n\nYou even admitted that you could've afforded a bigger house, but didn't buy one, because you liked the old one.\n\nMaya has always shared, and once she goes to college, she'll still have to share, because of how the concept of dorms work.

I get not having the means and it being it is what it is, but you had the chance to get Maya her own room and you decided to buy a house that fit your needs and not your children's.", "YTA.\n\nMaya needs a space to study quietly.  Having to share a room with a younger sister with an 8:30 bedtime means Maya can't do many things in her own room due to her younger sister's schedule.  How on earth is Maya managing to study in peace?\n\nAlso, you have admitted that Chloe gets almost no punishment for going trough Maya's things.  All this is doing is showing Maya that Chloe's needs will always come first.\n\nThe age gap between Maya and Chloe is too big to bridge for sharing a room.  Is there anywhere else in the house to carve out space for Maya to have some privacy?  I'm guessing there isn't, or you haven't given any thought to doing this.\n\nYou had the means to buy a larger home, but chose not to.  Did you ever ask Maya if she's comfortable sharing a room with Chloe?  Or if she needed a quiet place to study?  \n\nYes, in some families siblings share rooms until going off to college, and in certain circumstances it's done because the family can't afford a larger home.  But because you did not have financial constraints, you still should have asked Maya if she would be willing to continue sharing a room with Chloe, and taken Maya's needs into account before purchasing a home.", "YTA\n\n>We do think these are valid complaints but Maya just does not seem to want to understand that her brother and sister can\u2019t share, and we can\u2019t conjure up a fourth bedroom. \n\nBy your own admission, you could have BOUGHT a house with a fourth bedroom & chose not to because YOU wanted a house like the one you were renting.\n\nMeanwhile, her younger sister goes through her possessions with apparently zero consequences.\n\nOh, yes ... she will be going away to university next year, and don't be surprised if she never comes back.

You had the chance to buy a house with enough rooms for everyone and instead you chose to buy an identical one to your old one because you were selfish. It's perfectly normal for your older daughter to need her own space for studying and privacy, she's almost in college!

Wtf, lights out at 20:30?\n\nDon't or shouldn't all parents strive to make it better for their kids than they had had it themselves..?", "Yes, YTA.  Based on what's written here and your comments, Maya has serious problems with not having her own space and her own stuff, which Chloe is exacerbating by stealing her stuff.  It's gotten to the point where Maya is starting to consider violent actions to be the only way to get her sister to stop, which is a pretty clear indicator that your punishments have not been working.\n\nNo, you can't conjure a 4th bedroom out of nowhere, but it was your choice to buy another 3 bedroom house instead of looking for one with a 4th bedroom or another space that could be converted into one.  Maya probably feels suffocated as she has never had a place where she can just be alone and decorate everything exactly the way she wants it and not have to worry about people going through her stuff.\n\n>She\u2019ll be going away for university next year and this won\u2019t be so much of an issue anyway.\n\nI'm sure she'll enjoy finally getting to be alone (assuming she's attending a university where dorms are separate rooms with a common space), but the psychological impact of knowing that she doesn't really have a room of her own to return to is still going to be there, especially since I doubt you're going to prevent Chloe from taking over the room while Maya is away.\n\nI also saw in the comments that you \"don't allow locks\", so yeah, you're doubly TA for raising your kids with no real ability to have privacy in their own home.\n\nDon't be surprised if Maya doesn't come back home very often once she gets used to having her own space for the first time in her life.", "It makes me so mad that people like you are parents.

I'd never even consider doing what you're doing for my kids: everyone getting a room would be priority #1, yes, even before a garage! (my man cave! lol).  And you're being a bad parent by not forcing some crazy strict boundaries between your daughters and following through on real consequences for breaking those boundaries.  You're got a near-adult woman, living with a brat, which you aren't parenting.\n\nGood job on alienating your daughter, I bet you'll go all surprised-pikachu-face when you don't understand why your daughter doesn't wanna give you any sign of life when she leaves.", "YTA big time\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>we can\u2019t conjure up a fourth bedroom\n\nno but you admitted you COULD have got a house with a fourth bedroom. you just didn't want to. teenagers need privacy, for a lot of reasons. the restrictions being imposed on her because of the sharing and ridiculous, and it is NOT super common for teenagers to share rooms (specifically when there's no reason they need to).

It seems like she's restricted to the rules set for the 12 year old, but she's not 12. \n\nYou also didn't involve your kids in this at all. Which I think is so screwy. They have to live there too. My parents took with me with them to tour houses. I actively remember touring the house they bought and have a memory of first walking into what later became my room. It is such a core memory. Instead you were selfish and went the easy way. I don't think that's right. Yeah, your oldest might be going to college soon. But what about breaks?

I bet what she can\u2019t take will get boxed up and put off to the side or stolen by her younger sister.  Then when she comes to visit you will give her the \u201coh baby Chloe is used to her own room now so you can sleep on the couch\u201d.

Or ask him to pay rent so you can afford a bigger place. Obviously he has his own room, so he doesn't really have any motivation to leave.\n\n\nWhat if she doesn't go away for university?

Maya has never had a room of her own. We had very little money through her childhood, so she slept with us as a baby/ toddler, then shared with our son (15m) from the ages of 3-9 when we started renting a larger 2-bed house.  \nBy the time Maya was 9, it was no longer appropriate to have mixed genders sharing. We moved into a 3-bed house, we gave our son the smallest room in the house, and the girls shared the largest room. It admittedly wasn\u2019t particularly big (definitely no space for a partition wall etc.) but had space for both their beds, drawers, books etc.   \nMaya was initially frustrated because, when Chloe was 4-6ish, she would throw massive tantrums and scream all night about going to bed, keeping Maya awake, but she has obviously aged out of that and the girls seemed fairly content sharing through Maya\u2019s tween years. We thought this was a very normal, healthy, situation, especially since my wife shared with her own younger sister until she moved out the house.  \nBy the time Maya was 15, we were in a much better financial position and were able to purchase a house. However, we really liked the house we were already renting, so we bought a house which was absolutely identical around the corner (it\u2019s an ex-council estate so lots of similar houses).   \nMaya was very excited about the move and had assumed we would buy a house where she could have her own bedroom, and was incredibly angry when she found out we had bought an identical house. She\u2019s now studying for her final exams and is constantly angry and arguing about her lack of privacy/ study space and having to share a room with a \u201cchild\u201d.   \nHer biggest complaints are not being able to have friends stay over, not being allowed to have the lights or her phone on or make noise in the room past her sister\u2019s bedtime (8.30 on school nights), and Chloe going through her drawers and things (which we have absolutely warned Chloe not to do).  \nWe do think these are valid complaints but Maya just does not seem to want to understand that her brother and sister can\u2019t share, and we can\u2019t conjure up a fourth bedroom. She\u2019ll be going away for university next year and this won\u2019t be so much of an issue anyway.   \nThis week, Maya got so frustrated with Chloe rooting through her clothes drawer that she threw a glass of water in her face, screamed at us that she hates us and we\u2019re terrible parents, and left the house for hours to just roam the streets. This broke our heart, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019re actually doing anything wrong by denying her her own bedroom. We thought this was a common situation for siblings, but Maya claims she\u2019s the only person in her year who has to share and it\u2019s embarrassing.  \nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
