No contract means there's no legal requirement for him to pay you - whether it's the right thing to do or not, there's no contract and therefore no legal expectation for it.

Why don't you be happy your friend is getting married and support him ? You can address the money later. Let's be serious here he's obviously not spending an outrageous amount of money to get married at a friend's country home lol.  If he doesn't pay you back he's also an asshole BUT there's ways you can absolutely come after him for the money . Small claims court with no lawyer needed to address any debt under 5k. I think you were nice for allowing him to borrow the money BUT you can't expect someone to postpone their marriage to pay you back. That just not going to happen because I'm sure he doesn't want to get stabbed in his sleep by his significant other. You should never loan someone money that you can't live without. That is a very important lesson that I learned the hard way. If he doesn't pay he's an asshole too and you have every right to pursue him legally.

Feel free to elaborate but at this point you haven't really provided a solid link for why the act of getting married has anything to do with the debt owed.  To be completely frank, as per your description, it sounds a lot like you're upset that your supposed friend didn't invite you his thing after you helped him out and you're expecting some sort of monasticism from him until you've been compensated.  I can assume a bunch of stuff about the situation or imagine he's spending buckets of cash but you haven't supported those assumptions.
