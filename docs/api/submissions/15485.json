{"id": 15485, "submission_id": "12w0y00", "title": "AITA for not leaving a cafe because my son was babbling?", "selftext": "My wife and I went out for coffee and a pastry with our 8 month old son at a cafe near our local park. He has started babbling more often lately and loves to play with his toy (that doesn\u2019t make too much noise). We were seated outside and were enjoying our coffee and pastry and were enjoying the sun and our sons babbles while the weather is still not too hot. \nAn older couple was seated after us at a few tables over, and they looked at us with distaste and made a loud comment about how parents ruin going out for others with their babies. A few minutes of babbling later, she asked us if we could keep our sons voice down. I told her we would try but no promises. We put on Ms. Rachel to try to keep him from making noise but he would start clapping or babbling still. As we were about to finish and leave, she turned around and asked us to leave so she and her husband could enjoy their day out. I told her she came to a local park, sat at an outdoor cafe, and had no right to make us feel bad for going out with our son. She told me that she never took her kids out when they made noise and we should take others into consideration. Her husband told her that was enough but in anger I threw out a comment about how she should be ashamed of herself as a mother to make other parents feel bad for enjoying themselves, especially in a public place where noise should be expected. My wife told me that I should have kept that last comment out of it because it became personal and a coworker commented that I should have just ignored her and not said anything. My wife is now hesitant to go out to avoid me responding that way to another person. I think I am in the clear, but AITA?\n\nEdit 1: Wow, this blew and thank you for the nice comments. Regarding the video, it was at iPhone volume level 2. Just enough for baby to hear but we barely heard it from a foot and a half away. Regarding the toy, it\u2019s a plastic toy with rubber strings. It makes a rubber sound that does make noise but not loud enough that it\u2019s annoying like the toys with speakers", "created_utc": 1682237666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12w0y00/aita_for_not_leaving_a_cafe_because_my_son_was/", "score": 6017, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We live in a society. Get over it.", "NTA! There\u2019s such a negative attitude towards kids at the moment anyway, but they need to be outside and be kids. Your baby wasn\u2019t being disruptive and you were at an outside cafe, if they don\u2019t want to hear noises/voices then they can go elsewhere or go home. \nI would of done the exact same thing you did.", "I think it would be beneficial for every single person on earth is we just had mandatory Child areas in every single restaurant cafee etc.\nNo people bitching about Babys babbling, no parents who need to deal with people bitching about their babies babbling and no baby babbling when you don't want to listen to it.", "Totally NTA. You're right, you both picked a public place to hang out and she has no right to demand silence at a park. You'd be an ass if it was a movie theater, but this is the literal polar opposite. To Hell with that woman.", "Wow NTA. I\u2019m child free and don\u2019t really enjoy being around kids being loud or obnoxious, but a baby babbling is so cute.

Your baby was babbling, not screaming. Sure, babies don't know how to control their volume but it's not disruptive or annoying. I am childfree by choice and still find baby babbling cute.

You didn't have to engage.  I don't think what you said was terrible though and doesn't make you an AH.  \n\nMy husband recently passed away, but before that I was part of an older couple and I think a cute baby \"babbling\" is adorable.  What I don't like hearing is a baby crying or a toddler throwing a tantrum.  Babbling isn't disturbing (unless one is trying to sleep lol).  \n\nYou were outside, at a coffee shop, in broad daylight.  Your baby wasn't screaming.  You are NTA.

And you were in an outdoor cafe in a public park - not somewhere where quiet can be reasonably expected. She was repeatedly unreasonable and from what you said about her husband\u2019s reaction, you weren\u2019t the only one who thought she needed telling. \n\nThat said if your wife is worried about going out with you then maybe you two need a discussion about where the common ground is for you both when it comes to how to deal assertively (but appropriately) with bullies in public. Because no matter how many of us here on Reddit think what you said was fine, if your wife feels uncomfortable with it then you\u2019ve still got an issue. \n\nYou can be in the right all day long but if it\u2019s making the person you love uncomfortable then you have to at least consider giving some ground (without making yourself too uncomfortable). Hopefully there\u2019s a happy middle ground for dealing with similar situations when you\u2019re together and agreeing what that looks like might help your wife feel relaxed on outings in future. \n\nShe\u2019s lucky she\u2019s not married to me though because if that woman had made that \u2018I left my kids at home unless they were silent\u2019 crack anywhere near me I\u2019d have been asking her whether they ever speak to her voluntarily now \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA.\n\nLol, \u2018never took her children out when they made noise\u2019.

It's a public, outdoor space and you and your family (including your baby) are entitled to be there and enjoy it, too.

But that's not how you started out your description. You said you were in a cafe on an outdoor patio. You were asked to try to keep the child a little more quiet and instead you added a layer of noise from an electronic device.\n\n Both parties were just escalating the situation. And I love the sound of a baby babbling but as soon as it gets into clapping and giggling it's a fair amount of noise. Mom of twins here.\n\n She should have moved and you should never put on an electronic device to try and hide the noise of a baby", "NTA. You were right and your reaction was right.

It sounds like the woman was an AH but was getting into it with her worth making your wife uncomfortable?

It is evident that parents become accustomed to all the crying, shrieking, and shouting and tune it out--the rest of the people in the movie theater/restaurant/ bar be damned!\n\nRespect is a two-way street.  If non-parents, or parents who secured a baby sitter are expected to tolerate reasonable volumes of child noise, then parents should drop the sanctimonious attitude when it comes to removing a child who is clearly being disruptive.  Child babbling at a lunchtime cafe? Fine. The same child babbling and watching tv on a tablet at full volume at a nice restaurant at 8pm? Probably not. \n\nThe solution isn't to stomp your feet and say, \"WELL, IF YOU DON'T LIKE CHILDREN'S NOISES, THEN YOOOOU STAY HOME, \"when anyone dares to complain about your little miracle's screaming, by the way.", "Again, where is this place you speak of?\n\nAlso, Mimosa brunches take place in restaurants. All different kinds of them...", "That's my point, that they know better but don't do better", "You don't expect babling noises from a baby in a park? Indeed much louder noises of kids playing?", "The post is about babbling.", "I'm not sure you are correctly understanding things. I was in no way complaining about my kids or being sleep deprived. And you're right, I was wrong; there are truly shitty parents that ignore, abandon and abuse their kids. I guess I wasn't thinking of them as parents. Good parents never tune out or just get used to theirs kids volume in public. They handle it. Shitty parents? I personally couldn't say what they do or do not do anything but based on the random insanely rude situations that happen, there are too many parents that aren't invested in properly raising a human.\n\nYou know absolutely nothing about how I raised my kids, because we're just strangers on Reddit, so I'll tell you. I'm the parent that has left a cart of groceries in the middle of the aisle because my kid decided to have a melt down over cookies. I took her out of the cart, tucked her screaming, kicking little self under my arm and walked right out. Because I personally cannot stand rude adults or children and simply wouldn't tolerate BS, especially in public. I have taken doors, replaced clothes with grey sweats, stripped bedrooms down to a mattress on the floor and nothing else. When one of my kids wanted to act like an AH in school, when I found out, I always held them accountable. I'm down to my last 2 being teenagers and they will rat themselves out when they do stupid shit, even when they don't get caught.\n\nSo your assumptions and interpretations are off. Maybe stop acting like you have all the answers. And since you likened parenthood to crack, I sincerely hope you've been sterilized because no human deserves that kind of mindset as a parent.", "I don't go to drunk events. Sorry. Can't help ya. \n\n\nWhy are you so interested in where I live ? I don't disclose personal location info on reddit. Lots of creeps. Middle class suburbs in a top 10 in population state in the US. Where do you live ?", "My bad! I misread your comment. Sorry!", "Parks are outdoors and spacious and children playing and making noise is 100% expected and fine. \n\n\n\nI was naming all the places where adults are a respectful volume 95% of the time, if not more. I'm saying the vast majority of adults keep a respectful volume at parks and aren't screaming.\n\n\nIf you read my comment I said I wouldn't ever say anything. I'm saying adults just cannot and do not hit the pitch and length of screaming that a baby or toddler can.", "Sorry, I wasn't actually trying to ask you to divulge personal info like that!

Hope your day is good", "I have a feeling the \u201cbabbling\u201d was louder than OP is letting on. Just my gut.", "You say the word \"babbling\" excessively. And the woman asked you to keep the noise down. My interpretation here is that your kid was testing out their voice by shrieking and being really loud. Babbling to me means making sounds at a normal conversational level. Your wife is hesitant to go anywhere with you in public, I'm guessing you've actually toned down the level of noise and your response to this couple.\n\nINFO: if an adult carried on conversation at the same volume as your child, would the couple have had a right to complain?", "YTA. Why do you feel that you are entitled to enjoy your day the way you want, and this couple isn't entitled to enjoy their day the way that they want? Do your desires outweigh their desires? No, they don't. Take into consideration that they come from a generation where children were seen and not heard. Their opinions on how children should behave are vastly different from that of young parents these days. I would also bet that your use of the word \"babbling\" was used to garner sympathy and that it was more likely the ear piecing shrieks that little kids do when they're enjoying themselves. I have a 1yo grandson.  I know. Look past the end of your nose before you go getting all entitled on people.", "YTA. If the couple was several tables away like you said, I can imagine the \"baby babbling\" you're describing probably including something more than a few decibels louder than just giggles. Not every person finds these sounds to be cute or charming, FYI. \n\nPlus, you're not actually in a \"public\" space, you're on the patio of a cafe. That's a private establishment, and patrons have a right to want to dine in peace. They are paying for their coffee and croissant, not to hear your kid shriek (even if it's happy shrieking).\n\nYou upgraded to mega asshole who you decided to put on a kid's show, in public, for your kid to watch. That's incredibly rude and disrespectful, but what can you expect from this generation of iPad parents?", "A happy, babbling, giggling baby? What AWFUL PARENTS! Lol jk. \n\nGimme a break. Absolutely NOT TA! Not even close!", "So your kid was screaming in public and your solution, when asked to quiet down was to stick an iPad in his face without headphones?

It becomes ridiculous when someone is actually trying to police a healthy family enjoying their time out with their baby who simply sounds happy and is doing happy baby things. I have no right to make their time unpleasant just because I don't love hearing their baby.\n\nI almost feel like what the woman should *really* be ashamed of is that she \"never took her kids out when they made noise.\" So... what?

Younger people now have a different mentality and I find them more immature than previous generations so have more hatred towards children because they see that family lifestyle as unsatisfactory .\n\nBut everyone is different, and in general now we as a society are more selfish and entitled so don't see the joy in innocent children just existing.", "Thats when this moves from AITA to Malicious Compliance, lol.", "Ms Rachel isn\u2019t considered screen time bc it\u2019s interactive.

Ours babbles normally but she screeches (in excitement) when she sees an animal but especially dogs. It's hilarious and embarrassing at the same time hahaha. We're glad she's so excited about animals though.", "Ehhh even this depends. There are several bars, breweries and wineries near my house that are openly child friendly and I regularly bring my 8 month old to these. And on the flip side, there\u2019s several other places nearby that explicitly request no children, and I would never bring my child to those places. The only one on your list I would definitely stay away from with kids is a high-end restaurant, but with the other places I\u2019d just ask the first time I go to check they\u2019re ok with kids.", "Neither can I! It's one of the most beautiful sounds. A young couple with an infant sat a few rows behind me at church once, and her cooing and babbling were so adorable.", " Baby babbling is beautiful to me. Happy babies are to be celebrated. Here\u2019s hoping the old crone stays home from now on.", "Lol! Always fun to spot ADHD in the wild", "Yea, fair enough. It would be just like an adult or kid/teen who keeps talking. Babbling is cuter then that.", "Yea, I used to work in childcare. It was stressful but I loved some aspects of it like that.", "Yea, like music to my ears.", "Wow. She sounds like a lot.", "If someone is bothered by loud noises why does it matter what the noise comes from? It doesn't even have anything to do with the kid, loud high pitched noises aren't pleasant to listen to.\n\nIt's not a value judgement on the kid or the choice to have kids, I just have sensory issues. The mood or cause of the noise doesn't change that. I do think OP is NTA just to be clear.", "In public settings I do expect good behavior. With young children, you need to try to include them in the conversation and give them attention, you teach them manners and that sort of thing. An 8 month old is probably a little young to be teaching \"please and thank you's\" to yet, but by including them in social settings, you are normalizing it and making them comfortable and if they aren't hysterically crying, then I think you're doing a good job. I don't know that much about the parents and their child, but I would say they are taking the correct steps towards raising a well-behaved child in this scenario.", "OP addressed that it was on iPhone volume level two.", "r/lies", "I usually ask to be seated away from babies. The last time I was seated next to little feral beast, it started pulling my hair. We got the food to go and I went straight home and took a shower.", "Same! I'm a cleaning lady and toddlers love new things. Question after Question.  What are you doing? Cleaning.  Why? So you are safe. Why? Because you need to keep yourself safe from the germs.  Most asked questions. Although I worked in the psychology ward and those children have weird questions.  Like is this cleaning supply dangerous? Noo. Just dangerous to bacteria. Is dangerous for consumption? Only if you drink it., but I'm not telling that to a girl barely 8 years old. We have all cleaning supplies under key, but she asked like if she would lick the table. Then no, as soon as it dries its harmless.  And we HAVE to stay until it dries. Cleaning supplies made for children. It just made me sad children that young think of these stuff.", "You eventually have no one left to pay money to the church.", "Unless they're screaming.", "I wish. My 9 month old inherited my loud, clear, carrying voice.", "Even if they are screaming.  It\u2019s a park!  You should hear laughs and screams and all sorts of noises at a park.", "this is because on the internet, being annoying is a deadly sin. therefore a lot of people think it's justified to dehumanize children simply because they're noisy and messy", "I'm on it! Pillows for all!", "And really, they're both true! In some ways society can be very age-segregated. It's really good to be able to relate to people of all different age groups and regularly spend time with them.", "Yay!!!!!", "NTA\n\nDid she actually think people would go dead silent and obey her orders like a queen in a public place?\n\nThis is called PUBLIC for a reason, maybe get a first class seat in a high-end restaurant next time so you wouldn\u2019t find kids being kids there.", "That is a really important caveat! As a woman who is VERY non confrontational with a husband who is quite assertive, thank you. I recognize my husband is right most of the time, but it still makes me very uncomfortable and he\u2019s done a lot to tone it down when I\u2019m with him and I\u2019m learning to lean into his assertiveness when he still uses it. Finding a comfortable middle ground with your spouse is super important!", "also wondered this. if OP is just used to the noise, can they really determine, any more, what is or isn\u2019t crossing the line for other people? if it was louder, then i understand the annoyance. no one is going to adore a kid more than its own parents, most of the time, and that applies to tolerance too.", "It\u2019s possible to play a video at a low volume, yknow ? Low enough for the kid to hear it and not anyone else. Probably quiet enough to sound like normal talking volume or even lower than that. Some families even put on muted videos because the visuals are enough sometimes.", "Sitting outside is a great choice they made because a noisy baby is better outside than inside. Also, there would be noises with or without the baby. He wasn't screaming or wailing. He was just making baby noises that was at the same level of sound as adult noises. This was no where near an excessive disturbance just because it involved a baby.", "Exactly. I suspect OP's version of events about how loud their child was doesn't quite match up to reality. Even another parent found their behavior unreasonable. And they were at a Cafe, not actually at the park. \n\nYTA OP", "I will change seats with my wife to have a better view of a cute baby at a restaurant.  Babies are such a delight!\n\nI hate to think what kind of mother this crabby woman was to her kids. \n\n OP, you are NTA, but I'd follow the advice about your last comment your said to this woman."]}
