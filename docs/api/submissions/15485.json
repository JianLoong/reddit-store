He has started babbling more often lately and loves to play with his toy (that doesn\u2019t make too much noise). We were seated outside and were enjoying our coffee and pastry and were enjoying the sun and our sons babbles while the weather is still not too hot. \nAn older couple was seated after us at a few tables over, and they looked at us with distaste and made a loud comment about how parents ruin going out for others with their babies. A few minutes of babbling later, she asked us if we could keep our sons voice down. I told her we would try but no promises. We put on Ms. Rachel to try to keep him from making noise but he would start clapping or babbling still. As we were about to finish and leave, she turned around and asked us to leave so she and her husband could enjoy their day out. I told her she came to a local park, sat at an outdoor cafe, and had no right to make us feel bad for going out with our son. She told me that she never took her kids out when they made noise and we should take others into consideration. Her husband told her that was enough but in anger I threw out a comment about how she should be ashamed of herself as a mother to make other parents feel bad for enjoying themselves, especially in a public place where noise should be expected. My wife told me that I should have kept that last comment out of it because it became personal and a coworker commented that I should have just ignored her and not said anything. My wife is now hesitant to go out to avoid me responding that way to another person.

She was repeatedly unreasonable and from what you said about her husband\u2019s reaction, you weren\u2019t the only one who thought she needed telling. \n\nThat said if your wife is worried about going out with you then maybe you two need a discussion about where the common ground is for you both when it comes to how to deal assertively (but appropriately) with bullies in public. Because no matter how many of us here on Reddit think what you said was fine, if your wife feels uncomfortable with it then you\u2019ve still got an issue. \n\nYou can be in the right all day long but if it\u2019s making the person you love uncomfortable then you have to at least consider giving some ground (without making yourself too uncomfortable). Hopefully there\u2019s a happy middle ground for dealing with similar situations when you\u2019re together and agreeing what that looks like might help your wife feel relaxed on outings in future. \n\nShe\u2019s lucky she\u2019s not married to me though because if that woman had made that \u2018I left my kids at home unless they were silent\u2019 crack anywhere near me I\u2019d have been asking her whether they ever speak to her voluntarily now \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA.\n\nLol, \u2018never took her children out when they made noise\u2019.

But, I\u2019m surprised your wife would be so critical - usually the Mama Bear instincts would make her fiercely protective - so wonder if your tone or words were really harsh?", "NTA\n\nand she needed to be told!\n\nSometimes I dont wanna be around other peoples babies/listen to teenagers/familes/old people, so I dont sit near them, or find some place else to be. \n\nSometimes I dont wanna listen to the silence, so I sit near babies/teenagers/families/old people. I find that its easier to move myself around, if I want peace and quiet.\n\nAnd dont you ever stop your baby babling, its a wounderful sound", "NTA. As a parent of 3 young kids, I understand they make noise and there's nothing you can do about it. You were in a public place, outdoors, and the baby was babbling (not screaming/crying/having a fit). As a newer parent, you have every right to enjoy public services just like everyone else. If the baby was screaming, it might be different and stepping away to calm him down might have been best, but him doing what happy babies do is totally acceptable. \n\nI'm a single dad and get a lot of comments if I ever take my kids out in public, I've made some pretty nasty comments to people who like to comment on me doing completely normal things with my children. I don't feel bad about a single one of them, and you shouldn't either. People need to learn to mind their business.", "NTA. As a father and a husband. I understand, I get those looks too. The couple shouldn't expect the world to cater to them, at least in a public setting. Whether it was you talking or your son babbling. Nearby honking or the birds chirping. Sounds happen in public. If they had kids once it is ashamed that they become so detached they forgot babies/tots make noises.  You can't quiet a tot down, and you shouldn't. Your baby was happy. You and your partner deserve to go out as a family too, whether or not your child is 8 months or 8 years old. Make memories, you did good.", "NTA. Your son is just about to start talking!!! So excited for him. For context I would have totally invaded your privacy and goo goo gaga\u2019d at him if it was okay with you. Some people just want to watch the world burn.", "NTA. If her wasn't crying for a long period of time then the old woman was a total awhile. You should have escalated and have them removed for bothering you so you're wife would have seen that she and you are in the right and she has nothing to be worried about.", "NTA. If he was screaming bloody murder that would be one thing.", "NTA this was in a public place that is shared between multiple age groups and no-one has a right to make parents/carers feel uncomfortable due to what their children may be doing. \n\nUnless their behaviour was dangerous ( I feel my own anxiety rise when parents allow their children to run around amongst people carrying hot food or drinks.) Then yes at times like this then I would approach staff to raise my concerns.\n\nAlso for  me people need to recognise the positives that babies/children can be for people in their wider community. The contact between different generations, I know older people who have no children and say how just watching children play and have fun makes them happy.\n\nThat generations can learn from each other, how can we understand each other if we don't listen to each other! We all have experiences that we can share!\n\nThis wasn't an adult only environment, it wasn't night time when family spaces become for adults only, some pubs in the UK don't allow children after a certain time.\n\nAnd I'm sorry to say to some adults if they don\u2019t want to be around children then you remove yourself as you're the one with the problem not them!", "Baby was happily babbling, not screaming and distraught.. but here's the thing. That couple are NOT the baby police. They are not the park police. If they don't want to be around other people, or children, or noise, maybe they should stay home in their soundproof bubble, and leave other people alone. \n\nI'm not a fan of screaming, tantrums children; (and I don't know any parents/caregivers who are) but if I'm in a place where that's happening, and I'm not ok, I CAN MOVE!  and I can do that without berating parents who are trying to spend time with their kids.\n\nBaby babble is adorable. Babies thrive on attention, stimulation, new experiences  and tons of  love.. OOP reacted to someone verbally attacking him and his wife, but also to them trying to tell him that his child was not allowed into a public space simply because their wizened, dried up hearts and minds can't stand to see other people happy NTA in any way whatsoever", "NTA - you were outside, at a park, and your child was not being fussy by any standard. The older couple could have gone inside to enjoy quiet if it was really what they wanted. The old hag probably would relax if her husband took the time to satisfy her. Good for you for staying so tame in the response!", "You could have been a drunk AH talking loudly and would she have been ballsy enough to say anything? Answer is no. The answer to you being TA is also no. Babble on.", "NTA. I won\u2019t lie when a random kid starts to scream and cry I am not a fan of it. That being said I don\u2019t think parents should keep their babies in the house and not take them outside. Take your kid out even if they have a bad day you all deserve to go out and enjoy public spaces.", "YTA - Seems it was a cafe, not a public place. So, yes, take your child to a public place & babble away!", "NTA, you have a kid, it\u2019s not screaming, and it\u2019s not bothering anyone else. And you\u2019re outside. They\u2019re just rude.", "You are seated outside, and have just as much a right to enjoy yourself as anyone else.  Fuck them.  NTA.\n\nProbably from the generation where the women folk stayed home all the time with the small children and thought to themselves children should be seen and not heard.\n\nIt takes a village is a lost concept to some.  Seriously if we were all just a little more human, the world would be a better place.", "NTA. She jabbed first and you were in a usually noisy public space. Id be more worried about your wife's inability to confront someone as that could lead to her and the child getting harmed later in life", "NTA - she sounds miserable, don\u2019t let it stop you from enjoying going out with your child. I would have had some not so diplomatic words for her", "NTA. At all. This isn\u2019t a screaming baby in a church service/wedding/movie situation.  Context matters.  There are plenty places where noise is perfectly expected and accepted.  This is one of them.", "NTA, a baby babbling is like them talking...\ud83e\udd37 You were at an outdoor cafe and if they weren't screaming then the lady was just offended that you dared bring your child out in public!", "As someone who hates children. NTA. They were babbling. If they were screaming and crying that\u2019s different, remove yourself until they are calm but babies exist to laugh and babble and poop. \n\nThat couple needs to stay home.", "NTA. I don\u2019t have kids and never will but like, people DO go outside. Old people. Newborns. Middle aged. If people aren\u2019t prepared for the reality of the outside world they need to stay home. I\u2019ll take the babbling of a child over the other way more violent and crappy things that happen in public these days, thanks very much.", "NTA and I continue to find it wild that folks feel perfectly comfortable stating a hatred for teens, children, and babies....that's a form of ageism, folks! If you want people to become functioning members of society you gotta let them participate. \n\nSame people who want kids to stay hidden are also pissy about kids these days and their screen time etc. Guess what- it is really hard to keep a child at home 24/7 and not use screentime! Even professionals on r/nanny say that their pet peeve is parents who won't let them take the kids on outings bc it makes the job SO MUCH HARDER.", "NTA however your 'ashamed as a mother' comment was totally not cool. Maybe she doesn't want to be a mom.", "NTA. 55+ communities exist for people who are past the stage of wanting to be around kids.\n\nGoing to a standard outdoor cafe is the exact type of place that parents should be able to bring their child. You can\u2019t go to a place like that and expect a sedate, adult-only lunch spot.", "Nta. Babbling is fine. The screaming and crying tantrums would be a different story", "NTA. My daughter does the same thing and if someone said something I would not have been as nice as you were haha", "I'm inclined to say \"NTA\", as it was an outdoor cafe and people should expect nose.\n\nBut, I do recognize the possibility that the \"babbling\" may have been more intrusive than you let on.", "I love babies babbling. She never liked her own kids, I bet!", "NTA! That lady was being rude", "NTA, you should have told her husband that his wife\u2019s speaking was running your babies day out, since she clearly has about as much tolerance as a baby does.", "NTA. She should have followed her own advice: if she can't shut up and make nonsense noise, she should have stayed at home.", "Right, as long as his not crying. I\u2019d rather hear baby noises than a lot of noises that come from adults.", "And if they were sitting inside the cafe, OP would still be NTA.\n\nIt's babbling. You cannot convince me that it is louder than people talking to each other in or outside a caf\u00e9. \n\nSure, don't take the kid to a meditation room or a cinema, or church, or any other place where it is expected to have a quite/respectful silence. (Look, and besides the cinema perhaps, most people don't mind hearing a babbling baby-near-toddler. Everyone prefers that over crying! Most would even silently chuckle or be amused when seeing/hearing a babbling baby)\n\nBabbling babies/toddlers are just sounds that one can expect when going outside or visiting public spaces. People talk in a caf\u00e9, a babbling baby is just another variant of that.", "Same. They were outside in a park, where noise is to be expected. If they were in a movie theater, that would be something totally different.  NTA", "I agree. Don\u2019t sit next to a family with a kid if you don\u2019t want to hear kids. \n\nSo long as the kids are respectful or volume appropriate then they aren\u2019t doing anything wrong and neither are the parents.", "She completely deserved to be told she should be ashamed. Nothing OP said was wrong", "Eh, I\u2019ve found that some parents can\u2019t tell the difference. I\u2019ve been in restaurants and planes and stuff before where a child was legitimately screaming and the parents just dismissed it as \u201ccute babbles, little baby noises,\u201d etc.", "Not everyone likes children or babbling. However, if you're in an open public space you have 0 rights to complain that someone (a baby, a dog, an adult) is making noise.", "Not everyone finds the babbling to be adorable. I wouldn\u2019t confront or say anything to the parents, because it is a communal space, and that comes with the risk of being annoyed by other people.", "It depends on the location, but OP was fine sitting outside eating pastries. If they took the kid to a movie theater than it wouldn't be okay. My sister doesn't attend church anymore because my 2 year niece won't stop babbling, she doesn't understand she needs to be quiet.", "Yes me too, from younger generations I almost expect hatred because a lot of them are very anti children but most of them are more than polite. Babies are developing constantly they are just communicating and learning in the only way they know how I'd rather listen to that than the vast majority of noise I overhear. Older generations can be so vile about children and parenting ideas and yet they used to be so pushy about everyone having children. OP is NTA if they don't like people don't go outside.", "I would rather listen to a baby babble and play with a toy than Ms Rachel come out of their tablet. People playing videos and music in public without using headphones is one of my biggest pet peeves.", "If you want to go out in public without children go to the damn bar or a club", "Babbling is not adorable.  But it\u2019s outdoors, so I suck it up until it becomes screeching.  Then I leave", "Agree! Happy baby noises are awesome and I am a grumpy old asshole.", "I personally can\u2019t stand anything babies or toddlers do - I just dislike them and I always have. However I understand they\u2019re a proliferative necessity, and as long as your child wasn\u2019t loudly crying or screaming, NTA. If they had an issue they could have moved locations.", "It\u2019s a adorable to you & other weirdo parents that think the world revolves around their child. It\u2019s delusional to make a general statement like that cause I don\u2019t find it adorable & a lot of pole in the comments don\u2019t either. Op is NTA in this scenario because it is in a park outside but if it was in a movie theaters/restaurant/plane/anywhere indoors then they would assholes. Op YTA cause you\u2019re arguing with older ladies & get hurt by words. Who\u2019s the real baby here?", "Same! Just yesterday I went down my cousins house and their gorgeous, gorgeous 7 months daughter keep repeating bambabambamba in the sweetest voice.", "This. That baby is smiling and having the best moment of their life over a random object, how you gonna be mad at that. Especially in a public park, where kids and families go", "I was going to leave this EXACT comment.", "The comment about kids only being in public when they're silent also seems to imply the \"children should be seen and not heard\" style of parenting which has been shown to be extremely damaging to children...*especially* when a child needs to speak up (such as in cases when another adult/person in power is abusing them). I feel bad for the old person's kids.", "Im an aunt, I cannot stand the Miss Rachel videos. I babysit often so we tried many shows until he became obsessed with Little Einsteins \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nGive me the classic art and music over Miss Rachel any day \ud83d\ude02", "Hey now it could have been cocomelon", "That detail made OP TA for sure. I go out to eat to get away from screens and devices, and listening to some shitty YouTube channel ruins that. \n\nChildren\u2019s programming is objectively terrible.

These baby baby sounds take a lot of energy for me to tune out and are annoying to me when I am trying to be present. I wouldn\u2019t expect the person to silence or remove their baby (and I in fact love kids) but it also doesn\u2019t make me a monster for feeling annoyed by the sounds.", "The kind with autism and sensory issues, in my case, when the pitch gets up there. But I would never have said anything to the parents, since it's my own thing to deal with. The baby is definitely not doing anything wrong.", "That sounds like a 'them' problem.
