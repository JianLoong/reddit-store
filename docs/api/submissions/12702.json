At least they will all pay attention now.", "op=NTA\n\nHe needs to learn, how to pack for himself, how to follow laws for himself.\n\nPandering to him, spoiling him DOES NOT teach him to be a responsible adult.\n\nYou can love him while not loving his actions/behavior.", "Hahahahahahahhahahahahahahahaha \n\nNTA", "NTA this is one of these scenarios where hard boundaries will always be needed, and you can never give ground, regardless how small or insignificant. Great job though! Keep up the good work.", "NTA if he is old enough to use weed then he is old enough to pack his own damn case and take responsibility for his own actions.\n\nit\u2019s time he cut the cord", "NTA he is a grown man that can pack his own  stuff... if parents mad at u then they should of packed  his luggage.... he will never  grow up or be able  to do anything sunce he is spoiled and expect everyone to take care of him...\nU did  right just ignore them all dont let them get to u", "NTA. Situations like that suck and I\u2019m glad you can stand up for yourself now", "NTA\nAnd good on you for setting a boundary!!\nHe\u2019s 18, not 5. He can take care of himself\nThis is in no way your fault", "NTA. He sounds like a golden child and your parents\u2026 whew. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that OP. Throw them all away", "NTA. I'm not sure how it is in Canada, but in the US, you're attesting to the fact that no one else touched your bag (or something to that effect? I forget what it is exactly). Had you packed the suitcase, he could have thrown you under the bus when his weed was found. Whether or not you'd get in trouble, I don't know. I don't know what the Canadian laws are, but oof, your parents.", " NTA. He should be able to pack his own luggage by now. And if your parents were so worried about it, maybe they should\u2019ve packed his luggage for him. He is never ever going to learn any responsibility if they keep doing what they\u2019re doing.", "NTA, BUAHAHAHA! This is consequences meet action day! I\u2019ll bet he learned more about making sure he packed correctly from this experience than he will from anything else! Sooooooopo NTA!  He got his just desserts, and so did your parents!", "Once again I\u2019m reading a post about entitled idiots getting mad and blaming someone else for their own stupidity lol NTA NTA NTA", "Airport security gets mad when someone else packs your bag.", "Hah! That's hilarious. Your brother is an adult, he should know better than to pack weed in his luggage. Your parents are coddling him and he's gonna suffer for it. You did nothing wrong, just sit back and watch the shit show his life will be when he has to go out and face the real world. NTA.", "NTA. It was a hard lesson but he needed to learn it. So did your parents", "Nta \nThat's weird as hell \nI learnt to pack my things from age like 7 with some help from mom but that stop after a couple times to make sure I packed everything", "Nta", "nta", "He\u2019s old enough to smoke but not old enough to pack his luggage? NTA", "NTA.\n\n100% your brother's own fault. You feel guilty because you love your family even though they treat you poorly.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nWhy are you still involved with those people? They don't seem to care about you at all more than just a maid, as you said", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d ask your parents why they didn\u2019t feel the need to parent their own kid, instead blaming you for their incompetence", "YTA Even if you didn't help him pack you could have reminded him of the law. You essentially set him up. You knew he didn't know the laws well. You knew he was mad so wouldn't be thinking clearly. You knew he was just throwing things in his suitcase and wasn't thinking about it. Did you smile when you found out he was arrested after how well you set him up?", "Lmfaooo I was thinking the same thing like how tf is this OP\u2019s fault. OP needs to have a serious discussion with parents to prevent any future heart/head aches\n\nEdit: did not mean to assume OP\u2019s gender", "Probably because OP is female. It don't know that he or she is, but that's usually the case with these golden prince stories.", "OP respectfully..\n\n\nFuck all of them! Your parents sound incredibly fucking dumb! Your brother is a major AH. \n\nYou should break contact with these people how tf is u not being a literal Goddamn maid and packing his bag so he gets in trouble for packing his own weed... ur fault? \n\nIs he a goddamn child?! Fuck all of them. U deserve better. \n\nNTA throw the whole family away \ud83d\ude12", "Firstly, NTA OP. However, I doubt the parents or the brother will ever see this as natural consequences and permanently scapegoat OP", "I wonder if they will ask the judge to hold OP responsible....and get laughed at.  GTFO with that 1950s BS. Good for you OP. And NEVER do that crap- if you maintain contact, stay at a hotel, or a friends- so you always have an out when they try this crap in future.", "Maybe the real reason they went to Vancouver was to go skiing and OP just happened to live there and they wanted a free place to stay.", "I\u2019m fairly certain OP lives in Vancouver but when their 18yo (assuming his age since that\u2019s the only reason I can think of for mentioning age limits) brother came \u201cup\u201d to visit from the USA for a ski trip (so likely Banff, AB) they bought some weed there.\n\nOp\u2019s parents and brother live in the states (hence the \u201cup\u201d part) and those signs about not flying with weed, even if it\u2019s legal in your state exist all over our int\u2019l airports\u2026 at least they did in Toronto and Montreal in January this year when I was there.", "lmao wtf, she didn\u2019t set him up. he\u2019s an adult, he\u2019s old enough to read the signs. he\u2019s old enough to pack his own bag. or better yet, why didn\u2019t his mom pack it for him?", "My (F) extended family is like this- not my mom or dad (probably under influence of my mom, but whatever). As a teen, our grandmother (Dad's side) tried to get me to make my brother's bed for him before school (she was recovering form surgery, my dad nixed that). Dads sisters often tried to make me responsible for my BROTHER's actions. Joy riding?  Somehow I was at fault.  Got a DUI, again somehow my fault. He was OLDER. But he was also the only son of the only son- so they wanted to make him the prince.  My parent never let them- but they sure tried.  I think it is cultural- white mid-west 1950s BS culture, but \"culture\" none the less. Thank goodness my mom's parents raised her better ;).", "If course OP is a woman.\n\nIn my 40 years on this earth I have seen many spoiled kids. This dynamic only exists when there is a woman to be forced as maid.", "I dated a guy in his early 30's and his mum still packed his luggage for him. When I went to visit them (we were long distance) I found out she still did his laundry for him too. It was not a turn on.", "Ah, I've always heard it as little prince for children. I guess golden prince is for adults?", "While I was never in the military, I spent over ten years of my childhood in the Boy Scouts with multiple ex-military scoutmasters. This is just basic life advice that should be easy for anyone to understand.", "It's been a while since I travelled internationally, but isn't that also a standard question at customs?\n- did you pack your luggage yourself\n- did you leave it unattended at any time\n\nIf the answer is yes to either, they inspect it more closely. Or so my grandpa told us, so we've always been very careful bleating the correct answers and never got a follow-up. \n(See also : white (lower) middle class privilege of course)", "I can imagine the argument:\n\n>It\u2019s not *his* fault, he had to pack his own bag!\n\nJudge:\n\n>so, he packed the drugs in his bag?\n\nEPs:\n\n>yeah, we told his sister to pack for him, but she was lazy and didn\u2019t do it, so he had to pack it himself, it\u2019s definitely not his fault!\n\nJudge:\n\n>\u2026\n\n>\u2026\n\n>verdict: guilty. And stupid.", "Even though I find that funny, I would not want to be that person.", "Having lived with him so many years she knew how he'd react, she apparently watched him pack otherwise she wouldn't know he just threw things in his suitcase,  she knew he wasn't from there so wasn't familiar with the laws, she probably knew that he wouldn't be paying attention to the signs considering he was traveling with his parents and would be following them.  She may not have expected him to get arrested but she did set him up to have problems at the airport.", "so glad for your parents!!! standing their ground and protecting the both of you! protecting you, from being forced to serve him and protecting him from turning out like the AH brother in this story.", "[removed]", "It don't know that he or she is, but that's usually the case with these golden prince stories.", "I mean I was taught to pack my stuff when I was well maybe starting when I was 8? I would get a run down of stuff from parents, once,  but I was in charge. If I forgot something, pretty much oh well, it was on me. Okay, minus a toothbrush, which I would get a new one if need be. These parents are completely not preparing their son for adulthood. Wow.", "or she knew it was in there because he got arrested \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f still doesn\u2019t matter if she watched him. he\u2019s an adult. he is responsible for himself. if anything, his PARENTS set him up by spoiling him and expecting op to be his maid \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Partial comment stolen from u/apricotlipgloss (which I would totally try if I ever saw it!)\n\nu/missiontechnology959 is a bot"]}
