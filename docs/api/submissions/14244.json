The only, ONLY thing that I can think of that would make you an AH in this situation is if you made millions of dollars per year and she could barely afford her own bills. Then you should pay for it. But even if you\u2019re the bread winner, most good genuine people in her situation would offer to help pay for the TV as much as they could. Sounds like she\u2019s being ridiculous.

Also, what kind of idiot sprays that kind of stuff on a tv and expects it not to break?", "NTA\n\nYou break it, you buy it. She needs to replace the TV. Who wipes furniture polish on electronics?

Following that logic forward, why would her accident require YOU to incur costs?\n\nMitigating circumstances might be if you make DRAMATICALLY more money than she does, such that to you replacing the tv is nothing and to her it has a major impact on her financial wellbeing.

But there are other problems at play here. \n\nThis should not be a my way or the highway kinda thing. Are you willing to break up on this? Cause it sounds like you value the TV more than your relationship which is the first problem. \n\nThe second is the fact that both of you have widely different views on the responsibility of replacing the tv. She doesn\u2019t want to pay for any of it. You\u2019re ok to pay for 25% of it which is why you\u2019re N TA. But How about 50%.

Yes, you might win a small claims court case for the value of the TV based on her actions.\n\nBut this is a \\*relationship\\*, not a trial.  Your girlfriend was trying to clean your shared home and made a mistake.  Perhaps it would be worth pooling your resources to buy a replacement, especially if you don't have the money yourself to do so.  But treating your girlfriend the the defendant in a civil case makes you....  the asshole.", "UMM yta. are yall even a couple? sounds more like roommates and not a team.", "YTA\n\nSometimes, my friend, we have to accept our lot in life. I have been used as an ATM for years, and if something breaks in my home, regardless of who broke it, it's on me financially to provide a replacement. $25,000 in car loans for cars I can't drive breaking down; $2,000+ on TVs and electronics; $1000+ on appliances.\n\nSometimes, you have to accept that regardless of who's \"at fault\" it falls on you to replace and fix it. Just the way life goes. We may dislike it and it might suck... but can't escape it. Buy the TV and move on.", "You are living together, who cares who pays, if you're living together you share everything already aren't you? Or do you exactly split every bill 50/50?", "YTA. You sound like a roommate. I'm willing to bet the reason she's so adamant about not paying is because you're so adamant about it just being yours. She likely doesn't want to buy you a tv you can take with you when she breaks up with you.", "NTA - but it does seem like you're being kind of a jerk about it. It was an accident so give her a break it's not like she did it maliciously. Are you pressing her to replace it immediately? She might not be able to afford it? Maybe split the cost 50/50 and then she can pay you directly to cover the rest of her share?", "Are you a scorekeeper? Do you silently keep totals in your head? How many things she's broken, when you paid for something you think she should have, hate that she uses a name-brand laundry detergent vs store brand . . .. If you are, the amount you paid for the new tv will spin in your head and you'll end up resenting GF's action and never let it drop. In that case, you should depreciate the tv, come up with a value, deduct the local housecleaner hourly wage and she pays that. She may never cook or clean again but you'll feel whole. \n\nIf you're someone who understands that easy is what you know you'll get it that not knowing is hard. She didn't know. \nHow were you cleaning the tv? Do you have a rag and a commercial spray that you regularly clean with?
