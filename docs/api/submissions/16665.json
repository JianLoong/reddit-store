It is, after all, your money now. But reading this post gives me the impression that making additional distributions would just result in more demands, and more ingratitude. When there's blood in the water, the sharks don't go away.\n\nYour grandfather actually did the one thing I wish more people would do, when they're facing difficult end of life decisions.

Besides, he told you in confidence.\n\nMain morality lessons I can think of here from my childhood:\n-chicken little. You do the work, you reap the rewards\n-the progidal son. Which is about forgiveness, but also repentance. Your parents have not truly rependted. Also, the progidal son's brother is told \"all we have here is yours. Do not be jealous...\" Sorry I heard the story years and years ago.\n\nWhat they are showing is entitlement. \"The belief that one is\u00a0inherently\u00a0deserving\u00a0of\u00a0privileges\u00a0or special treatment.\" This is immoral, or poor behaviour \n\nErgo, do not give it to them.
