I have been in a very happy relationship for a few years now, my partner is an absolute saint. I am also currently looking for a job. A good chunk of my life I was the 3rd parent of my household, being the oldest of a few children, pretty stereotypical stuff but nothing too bad. I am doing significantly better since moving and still have a good relationship with my parents!\n\nHowever, I have a ton of family that lives in the town I move to. Including my nearly 30 year old aunt. She only completed high school, is unemployed, single, and is living at home with her parents (my grandparents) rent free while she looks for a job. She is and has always been loud, rude, and generally just hard to be around. She frequently calls me a bad driver despite having been arrested multiple times for drunk driving and totaling multiple cars, she regularly makes comments about my body, constantly talks about people behind their back to me, and has made transphobic and somewhat racist comments in the past. Just generally hard to be around, especially when I've been doing so much better.\n\nEarlier this week while out with my grandmother and aunt, the conversation shifted to my siblings and the fact that my sister will barely be graduating highschool, if she even does graduate. My aunt immediately started asking me about my sister, asking what I thought of it and if I even cared about her. I very honestly told her that it really wasn't my problem, she's not my daughter and I can't be bothered to care. She kept pressing the matter and then shifted back to making comments about me, my education, and my partner.I eventually just kind of had enough, I told her her to leave me alone and shut up about it, then said something to the effect of \"if you care so much why not get off your ass, get a job, and help her yourself?\"\n\nShe sputtered something about finding a job, this is where I think I screwed up. I doubled down, telling her that it was her own fault she couldn't get a job since she did some stupid shit that got her on probation, that she got fired from all her other previous jobs, couldn't find a decent boyfriend and told her it was her own fault she fucked up her life. My grandmother supported me and kinda just shrugged off my aunt and though most of my family supports me, there are a few people saying that I took it too far and need to apologize.\n\nI'm tempted to make amends just to keep the peace, but I also don't really think I'm in the wrong and want to stand my ground.

It is best to cut this toxic person out of your life.", "NTA\n\nI'm going to call this one \"tough love\", although you'd probably argue about the L. If you keep getting calls to apologize, just say that babying her hasn't helped her at all.", "NTA you nuked her from orbit after she made you finally snap. Congratulations on hopefully not having to deal with her in the future.", "NTA - Grandma supported you, nuff said", "NTA - I have no doubt your aunt didn't like what you said to her, but, gee whiz, that's too bad. Don't run your mouth if you can't handle your shit getting returned to you. Maybe she will hesitate before being nasty to you next time. Do not apologize. She will take it as a golden ticket to continue her nonsense without consequence.", "NTA\n\nDon't throw stones if you can't take the heat.", "NTA. Your aunt is one of those people who criticise others constantly, the things they\u2019re criticising are the things they don\u2019t like in themselves usually. It\u2019s almost bullying. You reflected her failings back at her, I\u2019m assuming not many people do this which is why she reacted as she did. It\u2019s likely she\u2019ll leave you alone in the future as she\u2019ll have hopefully learned not to wake the sleeping tiger. She had an object lesson in fuck around and find out. Both my sister and I are the outspoken ones in my family, various people have learned this lesson, mostly by recognising the huge smile on our faces as we draw breath to speak. There\u2019s nothing wrong in defending yourself from a personal attack", "Going against the grain: ESH\n\nTalking about your sister hit a little too close to home, and your aunt overreacted and overcompensated (a pattern, I'm sure).\n\nI think you were probably right to put her in her place, but then (as you note), you went a little too far. If you think you've overdone it, that's generally a feeling to trust. You saying that you didn't care about your sister meant that people don't care about your aunt (to her, anyway), and I have to believe that's what set her off.\n\nI'd try and keep the peace and give her a very brief apology and limit contact in the future.", "NTA", "ESH. She seems like a jerk, but slinging insults at her which may or may not be fair is not the way to go.  You can call her out for her bad behavior, or if you just don't like being around her, then try limiting your exposure to her.\n\nIt's fine to call her out if she's attacking you (hey, I don't appreciate X comments about me, I think you should keep your opinions to yourself etc), but implying that there's something wrong with people's education (there's nothing wrong with being a high school graduate), relationship status (there's nothing wrong with being single) and job status (I'm sure it's hard enough for her) is not helpful.\n\nInstead of putting negativity into the world, focus on protecting yourself and just keep your distance from people who you feel are bad for you. Unhappy people are often going to try to drag you down with them, just stay away from those people.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can't really know why she struggled in school or struggles in relationships. She could have some mental issues or learning difficulty that isn't really up to her. Maybe adhd or something like that.\n\nHowever because she makes it your problem constantly I will vote for NTA. She could be more selfaware and humble and get some help if there are other reasons to her struggles. More than being lazy and stupid.", "NTA\n\n Why would you need to make amends??", "ESH. There are many different factors that contribute to success. While a good education is important, so is caring about others. You said you \u201ccan\u2019t be bothered\u201d to care about your sister and seem to think your sister and aunt aren\u2019t up to your standards. While your aunt certainly sounds unpleasant to be around, you sound pretty judgmental yourself. Telling someone else to find a job when you\u2019re looking for one yourself isn\u2019t kind. You should apologise.", "NTA. Aunt sounds insufferable. The only way to keep the peace with her is to shut her down.", "NTA.  She needed to be told that it seems", "NTA\n\nYour aunt reminds me of my own. She's just a miserable person who makes no effort yet is mad that life hasn't handed her everything she's ever wanted. Good on you for telling her some harsh but necessary truths.", "NTA. If you can't have family tell you that you're screwing up your life, there's no one else. 30 isn't too old to do something and move out of your parent's house, stop getting DUIs (heck, maybe drinking altogether(!)  ), get in whatever shape she wants to be in, develope the social skills necessary to date long term (I'm sure she can pull a guy for a night and thinks that's the same thing), etc. \n\nYou're going to get a lot of blow back from people about how you should develop empathy, but really the idea that you should cater to this exact form of urchin is the problem with too much empathy.", "Some.people just cant deal with the truth as i doesnt fit their ego ...", "NTA", "I was tempted to vote that everyone sucks, as you were a bit harsh. \n\nBut honestly, she deserved it. She says harmful things to you and others all the time. Maybe she needs to see how it feels to be on the receiving end. \n\nPeople like her don\u2019t take hints. \n\nNTA", "I was going to write something similar, instead I'll reiterate: being a jerk isn't helpful or useful. Sounds like OP has some pent-up rage against her family's toxicity and issues. Better for the OP to remove herself from them for some time to take a breather and find peace with herself. Being a jerk back to someone who obviously has issues might feel good at the moment, but then you have to deal with the aftermath. Don't have to apologize, stop hanging around these people! You got yourself out. And realize your sister might be struggling from the same issues you have with your family, just handling it poorly. Empathy is not excusing bad behavior, but it can help you handle it.", "Yeah, I do think both of you have very good points. I just am very sick of the way she's talks about me (my relationship, my body, my education, everything) as well as being treated like I should be my sister's parent, which I think is why I snapped at her.\n\nThe problem with limiting contact with her is that she lives with my grandparents, who I care about and want to visit :(\n\nI'm also just worried apologizing will make her think it's okay to treat me like that, like as bad as I feel I don't want to give her an inch out of fear she'll take a mile", "Yeah, don't apologize. Practice words like \"stop\", I heard you already, you've already told me, I get it, you've made your point, or passive aggressively agree- yep, yep, yep, etc. You wanting to see your grandparents does put you in an unfortunate situation. Hopefully, she'll get a job and you can visit when she actually leaves the house! Good luck!", "I definitely will be sticking to just ignoring her or shrugging her off in the future. Thank you!", "One more piece of advice from someone who has lived much longer: everyone else around her is as annoyed as you are. They found their self-talk to get over it. I tend to work on feeling bad for someone like this so I can get over it. You're not the only one annoyed with her, they  just might not tell you b/c they don't think they should b/c she's family, older-- not fair to you, but people aren't as stupid about what's going on as we sometimes think. Took me awhile to get that.", "Yeah, my grandma just kinda accepted everything I said without a comment so I'm assuming she didn't mind me finally saying something back. Thank you so much, it does ease my mind a little to think about the fact that I'm not the only one who gets annoyed with her", "Your grandma knows! She feels bad, but she also has to deal with the pain of knowing she raised this woman, I assume. Your grandma is struggling, too."]}
