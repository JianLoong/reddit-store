So I stopped.  I talked to my sons and they both were fine with it.  Sometimes when I call out \"boy\" they yell back \"me boy or him boy\"?  \n\nBut since that meeting I have never referred to my daughter by anything other than her name.  Other than that our relationship has not changed.  I accepted that she didn't want to be treated a certain way.  \n\nLast summer we had a family reunion.  My parents were the guests of honor since it was also their 50th anniversary.  We live across the country so it was the first time that my wife and kids were around so much of my family at once.  \n\nIt was a great time.  And all my relatives were yelling for their kids constantly.  And my daughter was the only one that was only being called by name.  No one made a big deal about it or anything.   \n\nLast week I was asked to meet with her counselor again.  It turns out she is feeling excluded by my family because they don't call her girl or hey you.  She is mad at me for having fun nicknames for her brothers but only calling her by her name.  \n\nI asked if she remembers why that started.  She said that I embarrassed her in front of her friends by calling her girl.  And that she had asked that I call her by her name.  \n\nSo now I'm confused.  She had no problem being called by her name for over a year.  Now that she has seen that is how my family is, which she knew before because we had gathered together before in smaller groups, she wants to be called nicknames and stuff again.  Which is fine.  \n\nSo I asked if she wanted me to limit her nicknames to private family time?  For example when I take them to the movies I will call them by her name, boy number one, and hey you.  Which was something she had brought up as rude before.  \n\nShe said I was cherry picking situations and that I should just know.  \n\nI don't since I cannot read her mind.  \n\nShe is 16.
