So I stopped.  I talked to my sons and they both were fine with it.  Sometimes when I call out \"boy\" they yell back \"me boy or him boy\"?  \n\nBut since that meeting I have never referred to my daughter by anything other than her name.

My parents were the guests of honor since it was also their 50th anniversary.  We live across the country so it was the first time that my wife and kids were around so much of my family at once.  \n\nIt was a great time.

No one made a big deal about it or anything.   \n\nLast week I was asked to meet with her counselor again.  It turns out she is feeling excluded by my family because they don't call her girl or hey you.

She said that I embarrassed her in front of her friends by calling her girl.  And that she had asked that I call her by her name.  \n\nSo now I'm confused.

Now that she has seen that is how my family is, which she knew before because we had gathered together before in smaller groups, she wants to be called nicknames and stuff again.  Which is fine.  \n\nSo I asked if she wanted me to limit her nicknames to private family time?  For example when I take them to the movies I will call them by her name, boy number one, and hey you.

She probably didn\u2019t know how to bring it up to you. I\u2019d let her know it\u2019s okay to change her mind and open that line of communication to do so; that way you can change in the moment and not have to wait for the counselor to help bring it up. Could be a codeword or something fun too, maybe?\n\nYou seem like a great parent. Keep it up.", "NTA if that was embarrassing for her around her friends she should have just told you that so she could \u201cnot be left out\u201d [which I don\u2019t think she was it was her choice] then you could have your family still call her that. But no she didn\u2019t properly communicate that so it\u2019s her issue maybe she should have told her parents/ family that she was just embarrassed around her friends that wouldn\u2019t be so bad but now she is just causing a problem after she failed to properly communicate. NTA", "Lol my thoughts exactly she is in an argument with herself and the argument is not over yet lol. That's why she couldn't even give a definitive reply as to when to be called by and nickname and not. Lol. Bless her young hearts. OP NTA", "Nailed it", "Yep.", "NTA-OP what a perfect explanation I shall remember this when my kiddo gets older!", "Yeah i am surprised at all the answers here. I think this is clearly NAH. She was embarrassed she was called \"girl\" in public, but still wants to be included in the way op talks to the family at home.", "Okay I just don't get it I know that teenagers have a complex of hormone social anxieties and certain standard they have to live up to by society and all that. But can they honestly think that we should read their minds about certain topics of this. I think the Dad should, no wait I don't think anything the dad did was wrong the daughter is just basically seeking expectations while so not giving complete and straightforward answers. Anyway ask her again if she really wants a nickname or she just wants to be called her actual name because you can't read her mind unless she tells you what is up and also if she is embarrassed in ask her clearly that she want a nickname or does she want to be cool because the other day not too many of her friends will be around but her family will always be there to throw little punches and Wise Cracks", "NTA, she just doesn\u2019t seem to know what she wants and might be frustrated/embarrassed by that. Ask her to try have a more casual discussion with you about it when she\u2019s thought it over and is ready.\n\nYou\u2019ve definitely done the right thing by being as respectful as you can. Good on you <3", "Def NTA", "NTA. You've respected her wishes as expressed and the compromise you offered was reasonable. There's no missing steps; you've done all you can do.", "NTA - But to me her stance seems obvious, even if she's unable to articulate it. Not in front of her peers, who wouldn't understand,. but yes with family to be one of the gang. She just wants to belong.", "\"you should know\".... Even if you did know, it'd be wrong lol \ud83d\ude04", "NAH it's called being 16 lol. You can laugh about this together in 10 years", "This is so well explained- I\u2019m going to borrow this, thanks", "I'd get a new counselor.", "LOL! One day my dad turned towards where I was sitting, looked at me and proceeded to run through all of our names (the boys too), one of the dogs, and finally waving his arms around around he sputtered \u201cYOU! Whatever your name is! Paula!\u201d I calmly put my sandwich down and said \u201cI knew you\u2019d get there eventually!\u201d We both laughed. Then he realized he\u2019d forgotten what he was going to say!", "I have ONE kid. She often gets called all 4 of the dogs' names *and* the name of our baby we lost at 30 weeks.", "I remember reading (back in the late 80s) about a mom who took her teenage daughter shopping and was suggesting outfits she thought the daughter might like. With an exasperated sigh, the daughter says something like, \u2018Mom, you never let me choose my own clothes. Just leave me alone and let me pick out my own clothes.\u2019 She\u2019s a little hurt but complies.\n\nA couple of months later shopping, the daughter holds up an outfit and asks her mom what she thinks. Mom remembers the last interaction and says, \u2018If you like it, that\u2019s all that matters.\u2019 The daughter gets upset and tells her mom she doesn\u2019t care and never helps her. The mom was like \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "F***ing eh it really is\u2026for all kids actually.\n\nThanks @u/Infamous_Control_778", "Probably her counselor can help her work through what she's feeling properly, and what she really wants to express.", "She does need to walk back her demand then. She can't insist he never say it, then a year later tell him that he should be calling her nicknames and should know when. \n\nOP is literally doing as she asked. She has the right to change her mind, but she has to use her big words."]}
