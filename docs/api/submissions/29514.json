Get it right!", "I'm sorry what?", "Are you the spirit of my mom?  That was her thinking when we were kids.  Thankfully she realized she was wrong about that when her grandkids came along.", "If you grow up using one kind of mop then it changes and it's a chore you don't do often at 13 you do need to be shown more than once", "Was this a one off or does little sister often ask mum to show her multiple times with chores?", "INFO: How is it you two aren't able to figure out a mop? Is it a special kind of Nasa space mop?", "Lol! Not on everything, of course.  My mom was a lot like yours. I just meant about the sponge.", "ESPECIALLY if you have a volatile parents who freaks out if you get it wrong. The 13 yo I am trying to help through school has this problem. Parents tell them to do a thing but have not told them or shown them how to do the thing. If they don't do it exactly right the first time they get screamed at. If they ask how they are told they \"should\" already know. If they don't do it, they get told they are useless and stupid but there is less screaming and they won't be asked to do it again for awhile. They have naturally determined it's preferable to be useless and stupid than to get it wrong and be harangued even more. But at my house they are very helpful and quick to learn new tasks because no one screams at them for not knowing something.", "Whenever she does ask to be shown how to do something it's because it's something that she's not used to doing/using and she's doesn't know how to do it or has only been shown how to do it once before", "Okay thanks for clarifying, I was asking as kidology can be do a crap job /make it hard so I'm not asked again. Just wanted to make sure that wasn't an issue at play here.\n\nIs mum otherwise patient and this was a one off or has mum done this before?", "Like I said we grew up using Swiffer mops and it was a sponge mop. Everyone is different and not everyone's going to figure it out on their own. I honestly don't see the problem with her asking for help.

My 13 year old forgot how to do something, how about I berate her until she does it wrong so I can berate her more. Fuck that NTA", "ESH.  She could have TOLD her, not shown her.  You not knowing could have figured it and told her.  It\u2019s pretty obvious \u201cthe mop needs to be wet to mop.  So where do we put the mop to wet it?  So go turn in the hot water faucet and get it wet all the way through.  Then either there is a metal or plastic piece that folds over the mop to squish most if the water out or you press it against the side of the sink.  Then mop.\u201d  The fact that none of you can look at a mop and think it through to figure out how to use it really shows a massive lack of very basic problem solving.", "Soft YTA. Your mom shouldn't have yelled, but she may be right that your sister is just trying to escape her duties. Mopping a floor with any mop is not a rocket science. The sponge mop is quite intuitive if you bother to look at it. And a 13yo teenager certainly knows what Youtube is and can find video instructions for sponge mop there in no time.", "ESH - How difficult is it to use a mop, even one you're not used to? At 13 years old Op's sister is probably at a rebellious age and probably mom is tired of it, however mom should show a better temper and encourage her daughter to learn something new (in case she's not faking it) instead of screaming. Without any more info, it seems that OP took her sister's side completely dismissing her mother's explanation.", "YTA for not knowing how to clean a mop. Seriously. That is ridiculous. It\u2019s not rocket science.", "NTA", "Totally ridiculous to expect a 13 year old to remember how to hold a sponge under warm water.  \n\nI remember being that age and telling my dad I didn't know how to vacuum the couch, can you show me.  He got so pissed and ended doing it for me, and I was quite chuffed I got out of doing a chore.  Same vibes.", "When you\u2019re being ordered around by an abusive parent, even the simplest task can be intimidating. Nothing is ever good enough for them & anything you do brings more abuse so you\u2019re afraid to do anything at all.", "Its not rocket science to rinse a sponge mop. There is no learning curve. If you don't get it the first time you're shown you are being deliberately obtuse.", "Ha ha, very true. I wasn't thinking that when I read this. But yeah... never have I put away a dirty mop. That just reeks of laziness.", "Teaching children how to research and learn new things is important and needs to be reinforced, it's not always a natural skill people just innately have. \n\nThis would have been a good opportunity for OP's mom to suggest that instead of, idk, screaming at her child until she cried.", "How does the mother want her sponge mop cleaned?\n\nShe wasn't asking how to mop the floor. She'd forgotten how to clean the mop.", "See, if she does it wrong, mom gets even angrier. So looking it up will not provide instructions on how MOM wants it done.\n\nThe amount of trauma that comes from never being able to do anything right to a parent's satisfaction is something that only people with relationships of that nature will understand.\n\nNo, I can't do it wrong, or mom screams at me, but if she only shows me once, very quickly, I'm supposed to immediately remember every time these arbitrary and/or complicated expectations that exist for me to fail on so mom can be mad and be \"right\" that I'm useless so it justifies her yelling and screaming at me.", "And if the mom wants her to use some kind of special soap and 13 does it \"wrong\", she gets yelled at for being useless. Lose lose!\n\nI had a 13 year old tell me they didn't know how to wipe a table off. They were willing to do it, they just had *never done it before*. I showed them how and then let them do no matter how well they did. Big whoop.", "Ronnie?", "Wow. Mom is that you? Calm yourself", "A 13 year old couldn't figure out how to wipe a table off?  The explanation is in the name.  Not only should a 13 year old know things like cleaning a sponge or wiping a table off, they should be able to figure it out on their own if they don't.  They should have the problem solving skills to solve a riddle like that by 13.", "No, they didn't know how to move in the specific way to effectively wipe a table off and brush the crumbs off without getting them all over the floor. It's one of those things that take practice. They were a little clumsy and it wasn't the best cleaning job ever. It was done enthusiastically and willing, but sure, I could have mocked them and told them to figure it out instead. They would have felt like shit, but I could have done that.\n\nI'll just repeat this since you ignored it. \"And if the mom wants her to use some kind of special soap and 13 does it \"wrong\", she gets yelled at for being useless. Lose lose!\"", "Yeah, your mom seems to have a short fuse. I can understand how your young sister doesn't feel confident in trying something new herself. \n\nBut I still wonder how a healthy brained adult (you) cannot figure out a simple device like that.  It seems you grew up very very very very sheltered. \n\nHave you used a sponge before? Or is the concept of sponges foreign to you? Did you never try out new tools and devices in your own household?", "Telling them to figure it out isn't mocking, it's encouraging them to be self reliant and to learn for themselves.  Those are valuable life skills.  If they do a terrible job at it you say thank you for trying, correct them after, and then next time they'll know.  Wiping a table off does not take practice.  It's a simple chore that even a child can do, let alone a 13 year old.  Unless you explicitly mock them, they won't feel like shit.  \n\nYou're not doing them any favors conditioning them to go running for help before they even try to accomplish it themselves.  How's that going to look in college, or at a job, or in a relationship?\n\nAnd ya I ignored your first point because it's already a lose lose for everyone involved.  Mom loses for expecting her 13 year old to know how to do a chore and yelling about it, 13 year old loses for being too afraid of failure to try.   You don't need to add random speculations about how people specifically clean their sponges.", "If mom has a hair trigger and you're terrified of getting things wrong, then no, you don't ever experiment for fear of Mom's wrath.", "I disagree with this take very strongly. I'm sure OP could figure out how to use the mop, but that's not the point. The point is about asking for help. There are ways to clean+ use a mop that are better/more efficient than others. Sometimes figuring out how to do something yourself leads you down a more difficult path than necessary. I'm sure that if OP was at home and decided to use a sponge mop for the first time, they could figure it out. But when you're in a room with someone who knows how to do it, why WOULDN'T you ask?", "Why the fuck would children be bringing new household appliances into their homes just to try  them out", "...they're not my child. I'm their friend and a trusted adult. Me treating them like an idiot for not knowing how to wipe a table would ruin their trust. Me telling them how to do it and then joking with them did not. \n\nIt's not exactly random speculation when asking for help caused this mother to freak out and start cursing her 13 year old out.", "Can confirm. My mom always told me growing up I have to do what she says when she says it. When I did something else, even if it was helping (ie washing dishes instead of folding laundry) she\u2019d get mad. Now she gets mad that I\u2019m not independent.", "ESH. Your mom is mean but how do you have to explain cleaning a sponge more than once in a world where Google exists? I think your mother was mean, your sister was lazy and you were manipulated into getting in the middle of something that had nothing to do with you. If you want to help, buy them a swiffer mop and let it go.", "Exactly. Sister can be trying to get out of it AND Mom can be a jerk. It isn't either or. OP didn't help in any way, either. This was a 2 second Google search."]}
