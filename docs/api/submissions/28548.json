Lily is a bright, bubbly girl who doesn\u2019t let her disability dampen her spirit. My best friend, Jane (31F), and I have been inseparable since high school. She\u2019s known Lily since birth and has always been supportive, or so I thought.\n\nA few months ago, Jane excitedly announced her wedding, set to take place in a historic but not-so-accessible venue. I was thrilled for her and assumed provisions would be made for Lily. I was even more elated when she asked me to be her maid of honor.\n\nAs the wedding day approached, Jane shared the itinerary. I noticed there was no mention of any accommodations for guests with disabilities. When I approached Jane about it, she said that while she understood my concern, the venue couldn\u2019t make the necessary accommodations due to its historical status. She suggested I could leave Lily with a babysitter for the day.\n\nI was taken aback. I couldn\u2019t fathom leaving Lily behind, especially since she was excited about the wedding. The thought of telling her she couldn\u2019t attend because of her wheelchair broke my heart.\n\nAfter a lot of reflection, I told Jane that I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend or participate in her wedding if my daughter wasn\u2019t accommodated for. Jane was upset, mentioning how she\u2019d dreamed of having me by her side on her big day. She felt I was putting her in an unfair position so close to the wedding.\n\nOur mutual friends are divided. Some feel Jane is being insensitive and should have considered Lily from the beginning. Others believe I\u2019m overreacting and should respect Jane\u2019s choice of venue without making the wedding about my daughter\u2019s needs.\n\nNow, with the wedding just a week away and our friendship strained, I\u2019m second-guessing my decision.

Neither of us was wrong. \n\nThis sounds like there should have been conversations made at an early date so expectations could be managed.", "NAH here.\n\nI understand you don't want to leave your daughter behind, nothing wrong with that at all.\n\nAnd also a wedding is a very personal thing to the couple and the venue is a massive part of it so they pick the place that works for them, and as much as the child is the centre of your world it's not theirs.\n\nTalk it out as best you can and hopefully both sides can be ok, hold no grudges and hopefully the friendship continues to flourish.", "NAH\n\nFor you, of course your daughter comes first.\n\nFor Jane, her wedding comes first.\n\nIt is that simple.\n\nTalk it out. Agree to disagree and don't hold grudges. Don't let this ruin a long term friendship. It is what it is.", "NAH, but poor communication on both sides has led to some problems. I use a walker and wheelchair, which means that I have the responsibility to ensure that any venue I want to go to is accessible. As Lily's mom, that was on you, particularly when you were asked to be in the wedding party and you knew it was at a historic site where accessibility might be an issue. Having been part of Lily's life since birth, Jane also should've mentioned the problem when she first asked you to be part of her wedding. I'm gonna guess it may have slipped her mind in her excitement over getting married and the overall hassle of planning a wedding. \n\nWhile I understand your frustration at not being able to take Lily with you, I would encourage you to reconsider attending the wedding. This is something that will hopefully only happen once for Jane, and having you by her side would be a big deal. Perhaps you could arrange a livestream so Lily can take part from a distance? Or suggest that Jane get a videographer to film it if she isn't already doing that. Have you mentioned the problem to Lily, to see what she'd like you to do? This is something that's going to come up for her over and over again, and just having some input can help quite a bit. There have been times I've had to miss out on an outing and I've lined up something special for me as an alternative (went to the movies yesterday while my son hit the Ren Faire that was out in a grassy field) and there have been other times I've just had to skip the thing, but at least being able to say openly how much it sucked helped, whether I asked someone to stay or encouraged them to go.", "INFO: What kind of accommodations do u need ? Would it be possible for Lily to attend even if it not as accommodating as you would wish for ? Like i understand if it is in a medieval castle there is a high chance of not getting wheelchair ramps or elevators.  \n\n\nIm leaning towards NAH, i guess you cant blame Jane for wanting the venue she wants but she cant blame you for not coming either.  \nI hope you find a way for you and Lily to attend.", "YTA. Why shouldn\u2019t your friend have her wedding in the venue she wants? Nobody\u2019s child \u201cneeds\u201d to be present at a wedding. This is your best friend\u2019s big day and you\u2019re choosing not to be there for her instead of getting a babysitter for a few hours. What are you achieving now except ruining a friendship?", "NAH. You can't expect the bride to chose a venue just coz it's accessible and she can't expect you to leave your daughter home. The only problem here is communication. You never asked if you will be able to bring your daughter and she never told you there will not be any arrangements", "INFO: are other children going to the wedding? \n\nI'm leaning towards N T A, but if the wedding is child free anyway, then lack of wheel chair accessibility is a moot point because Lily wasn't going to be invited anyway. Also when the invites were sent out, it seems like you assumed Lily was invited, what was the wording of the invite?", "YTA -  I went back and forth, but you waited til last minute to communicate the issue to the bride.  That\u2019s the biggest factor in my ruling.  The location is chosen and cannot meet accommodations.   What do you expect the bride to do at this point?  Delay the wedding so a whole new venue is found?  You should fulfill your obligation at this point to your friend.  You are the maid of honor, you have duties in a wedding so your time with your daughter will be limited.  A babysitter wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea.  \n\nI get the reason why she can\u2019t attend is crappy.  I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t pick it for this reason.  She picked it because that\u2019s where she wanted to get married and tried to accommodate everyone but could not do it.  Unfortunately life sometimes swings that way.", "Lacks info for a judgment:\n\nWas your daughter invited (I.e received an invitation, your friend said the words \u201cshe\u2019s invited\u201d) or did you just assume?", "Was this posted from your friend's perspective on here several days ago?\n\nEDIT: trying to find it. It was in this, or shit mom groups say. I'll be back", "YTA. Sorry, but nuking your friendship because a historic venue can't accommodate your daughter is short sighted. Even in this day and age, not every place or location can have disabled access. \n\nThis is a learning opportunity for you and your daughter. This wedding is about your best friend, not your daughter and not you.", "INFO\nDuring all the planning was any mention of Lily in the wedding made ?", "NAH. You both should have talked about this earlier. She should have talked about the lack of accessibility to make sure you knew. You should have asked about it and not assumed.", "YTA - your daughter is 7, can you gather some men at the wedding and have her carried in? \n\nUnfortunately, the world and the wedding does not revolve around your daughters disability (it would be great if it did). Your friend deserves to have her dream wedding and it can be very difficult to accommodate everything. cut her some slack and either find a way to get your daughter in the building yourself (my family has carried my grandmother in her wheelchair up a flight of stairs before), or get a babysitter and support your friend.\n\nOr don\u2019t go to the wedding and flush your friendship down the toilet.", "NAH for the reasons others have stated.\n\nCould you perhaps talk to the groomsmen about lifting Lily? A child-sized wheelchair is mostly not too heavy even when the child is sitting in it. If some strong young men are  prepared for it, surely they can lift her in the stairs? It is ofc not ideal. But maybe doable, so Lily and you can enjoy the wedding?\n\nIt would be more difficult with an adult, but I feel a 7-y o should be able to come even when the venue is not adapted for wheel chair users.", "INFO - Was your daughter actually In writing/verbally invited or did you just assume that she was?", "INFO was lily invited and then discovered the building couldn't be adjusted?\nWhy didn't you ask when you received the invite if the building was accessible?", "ESH wheelchair user or not I feel like everyone\u2019s leaving out the bigger issue that unless it\u2019s the literal child of one of the people getting married it\u2019s very presumptuous and rude to assume or ask to plan an entire wedding venue around a 7 YEAR OLD who is no way related to the bride????? Absolutely ludicrous to imagine imo.\n\nEdit: finally found the comment where OP mentions Lily was specifically invited so judgement changed to light ESH because bride should\u2019ve communicated no accessibility earlier but I still standby that it\u2019s mostly on mom for not checking and again expecting the whole venue to be planned around Lily", "I'm not sure why this 20-odd-year friendship is so easily derailed.   \n\nYou and Lily are invited and both are thrilled.   You are MOH which is recognition of your importance to the bride.   \n\nYou say you '*assumed\"* accommodation would be made for Lily.   That's a bit much isn't it?   You must know it's your responsibility at the end of the day.  You must know the bride was incredibly busy.  So you could've followed this up.  Is this actually your guilt speaking? \n\nYou don't mention what accommodations are necessary.   You've only mentioned the wheelchair and a non-accessible venue.  So it's only the wheelchair?   How about four people at each corner lifting Lily in and out of the building then?  I can't imagine any guest saying no to that request.   Or is the wheelchair necessary for a short while?   Can Lily be carried in and seated and otherwise pampered throughout... again it's only to facilitate her involvement.  There may be other solutions *but you're not looking for them!*  Why not?  Why leap to the worst consequence for your friendship and even your daughter without looking for practical solutions? \n\nYou phrase this as a personal insult delivered by Jane.  You say she forgot.  I know people who'd love it if others 'forgot' their disability and treated them as people.... but that's for another discussion.   Clearly Jane didn't forget because she says the venue told her no accommodations could be made due to the historical status.  This is a valid reason.   The laws surrounding historical buildings are often horrendous to comply with.  There's no personal insult on any side. \n\nAnd Jane is right.   You put so much thought into your decision to pull out... I still can't understand why your thoughts didn't turn to solutions for your daughter and understanding for your long-term friend.   Instead you decided for scorched earth approach.   And it's not fair is it?   What can Jane do now?  What can she change?   How could you not have talked this through?!  If you haven't overstated the friendship value then you have overshadowed the entire wedding with memories of you not being there and all this pain (amd division of the wider friendship circle) for the rest of her life.  That makes YTA.", "NAH.\n\nI understand why Jane might want that special venue and why she wants that day to be as she wishes. Your wedding is the day where it's normal to put yourself and your SO first. And it's not like she doesn't want to make accommodations, it's that she can't.\n\nBut I also understand why you're upset and mad, I'm sad and sorry for your daughter.\n\nThat said I'm surprised no one adressed the problem earlier.", "Alot of people want to blame the bride for not thinking of your daughter, but people forget planning a wedding is chaos and things can get forgotten or just assumed taken care of. Hell, one time i was not even invited to a quincea\u00f1era that I helped the sister of the 15 plan. \n\nOp as the mother should have figured out the accessibility situation since the start. That should be second nature to her by now. \n\nI'm leaning more towards yta", "ESH - some places can\u2019t be changed.  \nYou should have checked earlier than a week out.  \nYou can\u2019t expect your friend to change her venue for YOUR daughter.  \nShe didn\u2019t do it to hurt your daughter but she should have told you the venue couldn\u2019t accommodate your daughter.  \nThe only one I feel sorry for is your daughter and you owe her an apology for dropping the ball by not making sure she could go before telling her she could.", "INFO: who was going to watch lily while you stood in the wedding and got ready with the bridal party morning of? Not accommodating her disability is shitty, but was there ever a plan made for the day of? Would someone have to babysit her anyway?", "You couldn\u2019t fathom your daughter missing the wedding because of her wheelchair, but made a decision that means she misses the wedding because of her wheelchair and in addition leaves your best friend without a maid of honour and drama to deal with only a week before her wedding. I\u2019m sorry YTA not for not going, but for presuming that your daughter would be accommodated without checking, allowing your daughter to be excited  then knowing she was excluded because of her disability. Your friend has her day made more difficult when a bit of foresight on your part could have made it clear to everyone that you wouldn\u2019t be able to attend. That would have meant no fuss, no disappointment for your daughter and no reorganising for the bride.", "YTA. This day is not about you or your daughter. Your friend had a million things to plan and just overlooked this detail. I find it ridiculous that your child cannot stay with a sitter to let your friend have the day she had planned. She is 7. She will get over the disappointment if you stop making it a big deal.", "YTA honestly, it's not that she didn't try to make arrangements but if she's getting married in a historic (and thus legally protected) building then they cannot make adjustments to accommodate. When you asked Jane her response was that they are unable to make those accommodations, not that she didn't care to ask. It's a shame but it's not as if Jane didn't want Lily to be there, it's just an unfortunate set of circumstances. I'm not sure on the status of 'listed' buildings in every country but here in the UK protection orders are put in place to prevent any work being done to buildings that are of significance or are very old structures, so if they genuinely can't accommodate it because of this then I've got no idea what you expect her to do.", "NTA for making this decision but let this be a lesson to you. Few places are wheelchair accessible, even fewer historical sites, and as Lily's parent it is currently your job to be on top of whether or not she can actually access a place or not if it is important that she goes there and that you do so early. As she gets older she can start doing it for herself but at 7 it is your damned job and you're mildly an asshole for not checking up on it earlier.", "How did you intend to fulfill your MOH duties while caring for a disabled child? Sitter was the logical choice here.", "YTA! It is just 1 day. Not everything has to be around your daughter.

Jane was upset\n\nNAH\n\nJane is right to be upset that you aren't attending, but you are right to choose your daughter over a wedding. The venue isn't an asshole because many historical buildings cannot be retrofitted with accessibility accommodations.", "I can understand both points of views, however, Lily is your priority, not hers. Why on earth did you assume rather than simply ask your best friend? Surely it wasn't that difficult a conversation?\n\nWhat I object to is that you've now raising this at this late date and stressing out your friend. Weddings are huge stress points and have a huge amount of time, money and planning. Sometimes things gets missed. \n\nYou are Lily's advocate, you cannot assume everyone including friends and family have arranged everything for your daughter. It's like an allergy, it's good to touch base. \n\nIf I was your friend, I would be disappointed in you, I'm afraid.\n\nDo you ensure accommodation are made for Lily is made on other occasions or do you simply assume?", "YTA. She obviously picked the place due to it\u2019s beauty and historic charm.  That unfortunately may mean it\u2019s exempt from having to install ramps etc.  It literally sounds like you\u2019re saying she shouldn\u2019t have picked that place because of your daughter.  There\u2019s no way around your logic.   \n\nI\u2019m sorry and that\u2019s a shame but\u2026 now you\u2019re not going and it\u2019s in a week and you were maid of honor?!?   Can you not figure out a way to get your daughter and her chair inside without ramps etc like is there really no way?  If not, then\u2026your daughter doesn\u2019t go.  \n\nLOTS of parents go to weddings without their kids, even when they\u2019re named on the invitation. You\u2019re also IN the wedding, how much attending to your daughter can you do?   Maybe she shouldn\u2019t go. Thems the breaks, wheelchair or not.

It\u2019s your obligation to see to your child\u2019s well-being ultimately. Your friend probably assumed that you would ensure that Lily has accommodations she needs unless she normally takes care of that when you go other places?", "Not to be rude but did she even want your daughter there? Its hard to blame her not picking a venue around a random 7 year old and she may have just assumed you would want to make this a date night and get a sitter. \n\nSounds like you just assumed your kid was included and now you're mad you got your kid excited when you shouldn't have. \n\nGonna have to say YTA", "NAH. It\u2019s your friends wedding. It\u2019s her day, not yours. She\u2019s going to have the one she wants, in the venue she wants, but she can\u2019t very well change a venue\u2019s ability to accommodate your daughter. And while she should have maybe considered this ahead of time, she probably assumed accommodations could be made just like you assumed they would be made. Next time just make your concerts clear earlier and everyone avoids the uncomfortable situation of having you back out late in the wedding planning.", "NAH, it's a shame your friend couldn't accommodate your daughter's needs, but this feels like something you should have mentioned as soon as you realised your daughter was invited, so you could both plan accordingly. \n\n\nUltimately it sounds like you've expected your friend to accommodate for you daughter without discussing it early on. \n\n\nYou both dropped the ball, but it doesn't sound like it's out of malice. Could you of made alternative arrangements for your daughter while you attended the wedding? \n\nCrucially though, don't let this ruin your friendship, its happened, it was a mistake, but if she's your best friend and it doesn't fit a pattern of behaviour, forgive, apologise for not attending and carry on as normal.", "YTA\nYou're somebody with a disabled child and it's your job to be ensuring there's accessibility in the venue, the bride will be absolutely overwhelmed with planning this wedding and honestly it isn't her job to look out for your child. Surely you can get a babysitter that is experienced in similar situations considering you were supposed to be maid of honour. As if you dropped out a week before the wedding. Frankly I find it disgusting. Your daughter is only 7 she has very little place at a wedding anyway and she'll probably forget all about it. This day is supposed to be about your friend not you, you've failed as a friend here.", "YTA, your daughter is not getting married, Jane is.", "YTA - Jane was wrong to not communicate the inaccessibility to you earlier, but its her wedding, and I'm sure she wanted your daughter to be there but the venue she picked doesn't accomodate her. I would not expect her to choose her venue based on your daughter. It's her wedding, her day, and you should be there for her. I don't get why you can't leave a seven year old with a babysitter for the day. \n\nYes, she'd rather has this venue than have your daughter attend, get over it. Wedding planning is hard and expensive, it might be the best option for HER financially or logistically or she just really likes it - its HER wedding. Doesn't mean she doesn't care about you or your daughter but she comes first today. I think it would be a mistake for you to die on this hill and not be there for her.", "YTA. The wedding isn't about your daughter. It's fine to be unhappy about the lack of accommodation for your child. That sucks. But as a parent of a disabled child, isn't checking for accessibility a pre-req for anywhere you go? You've known the venue for a long time and you never bothered to ask? Pulling this stunt last minute reeks of main character syndrome. Instead of finding potential compromises, you'd rather just sulk and issue a last minute ultimatum.", "Info: Only due to not being clear on the post you say the bride said she thought you get a babysitter yet you say your daughter was invited?\n\nSo why would your friend expect a babysitter?", "INFO was your daughter named on the invitation, or have you just assumed she\u2019s going?

I'd find it hard to have to decide or look for  a different venue based on this one factor.  \n\n\nYou can choose to not go, but if I were to start by elimination then your friend isn't an asshole, depending on how she suggested you leave your daughter at home.  \n\n\nWith that in mind and although I can't say I relate then you need to consider making some compromises. Can your daughter be brought and carried over to the tables area and then proceed to have her close without having to travel too much around?

One can argue for both sides but what really went wrong is that you didn't adress it from the beginning and as Lily is your child, I think you should have more than her. Also most of us know how overwhelming a wedding is, especially for the bride and you as maid of honour should help her and point out things she misses, not only about your child but generally. Think about a solution and talk to your friend about it but if there is nothing to do by now, be aware that you staying away at this point in time deprives your best friend (bride) of 1. her best friend 2. her maid of honour 3. a joyfull wedding in parts. That's a hard pill to swallow and can mean that your friendship doesn't last in the future.", "YTA accepting any spot in the wedding (let alone MOH) is a huge responsibility. Ditching them at the last minute because you can\u2019t bring your child along is a real AH move! The venue was set from the beginning. Historical places are what they are & need to be preserved to be authentic. Changing them even to accommodate disabled people takes away what is special about them at least & destroys their historic status at worst. No historical location can be expected to make such accommodations. If a disabled child absolutely needs to be there the parent(s) of that child need to figure out how to accomplish this. It is not the venue\u2019s responsibility, it is your own! If this isn\u2019t possible or practical then a babysitter is the right choice.

Your seven year old daughter will get over missing some random thirty year olds wedding.", "Oh yes your best friend's wedding is all about you and your kid. Just stop. Why is it appropriate for you to make your best friend's wedding all about you? Some friend you are. You knew it was in a historic building.  you should have checked out accommodations early and had this discussion a long time ago, and then made child Care arrangements. Your daughter does not have to be the center of the world all the time. Because I guarantee you she's only the center of the world to you. Did anyone at any point send an invitation to your kid? Or did you just assume that the whole thing was going to revolve around you? YTA.", "To be honest you are kind of in the wrong. It\u2019s not clear whether your daughter was actually invited originally or not. I appreciate your daughter was excited but unfortunately she is not a priority to the bride on her wedding day. The bride wants her wedding to be how she wants it and she shouldn\u2019t have to make changes just to accommodate your daughter although not sure how much of an impact these accommodations would need to be but they sound quite significant. I think you are being unreasonable to not go entirely. Is there any way for your daughter to attend part of the wedding?", "NAH This post reads as if you're a single parent? \n\nYour friend assumed you wouldn't be bringing your daughter because you're a bridesmaid and you don't have a partner who would look after her throughout the day.

Lily is a bright, bubbly girl who doesn\u2019t let her disability dampen her spirit. My best friend, Jane (31F), and I have been inseparable since high school. She\u2019s known Lily since birth and has always been supportive, or so I thought.\n\nA few months ago, Jane excitedly announced her wedding, set to take place in a historic but not-so-accessible venue. I was thrilled for her and assumed provisions would be made for Lily. I was even more elated when she asked me to be her maid of honor.\n\nAs the wedding day approached, Jane shared the itinerary. I noticed there was no mention of any accommodations for guests with disabilities. When I approached Jane about it, she said that while she understood my concern, the venue couldn\u2019t make the necessary accommodations due to its historical status. She suggested I could leave Lily with a babysitter for the day.\n\nI was taken aback. I couldn\u2019t fathom leaving Lily behind, especially since she was excited about the wedding. The thought of telling her she couldn\u2019t attend because of her wheelchair broke my heart.\n\nAfter a lot of reflection, I told Jane that I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend or participate in her wedding if my daughter wasn\u2019t accommodated for. Jane was upset, mentioning how she\u2019d dreamed of having me by her side on her big day. She felt I was putting her in an unfair position so close to the wedding.\n\nOur mutual friends are divided. Some feel Jane is being insensitive and should have considered Lily from the beginning. Others believe I\u2019m overreacting and should respect Jane\u2019s choice of venue without making the wedding about my daughter\u2019s needs.\n\nNow, with the wedding just a week away and our friendship strained, I\u2019m second-guessing my decision.

When my husband first went into his wheelchair we had to look hard to find suitable places to eat out without it turning into a nightmare but it is loads better now thanks to the disability act.", "NTA. \n\nWhile planning events I consistently have this issue with colleagues. They always pick something that isn't accessible, because able bodied people don't think what would limit a wheelchair user. \n\nNarrow doorways. Stairs (even one step!).

The list goes on. \n\nAs a society we need to be aware of such things and have a little more consideration for others. \n\nShe should have made accommodations because she invited her. If accommodations were impossible,  then she should have been honest from the start. \n\nBeing this is your best friend, who is more than aware of your kids limitations, and is probably seen as more of an Aunt, she should be ashamed of herself for her lack of foresight. It's downright rude. \n\nThen again I knew a bride who did this to her own grandmother.", "NAH- Planning a wedding, especially when your heart is set on a venue, is a lot. I'm not going to come down on your friend too hard for not asking about accommodation before she involved you because however close you are, she isn't in a position of having to think about people with disabilities all the time in the way you are. As insensitive as that seems, she can't be expected to change the venue or their rules for the sake of one person. She was put in a difficult position with this, and the solution she proposed was the only one she could offer.\n\nThat said, her oversight and solution aren't going to work. I think anyone in your position would have bowed out. My heart broke a bit while I read your story, but I wouldn't be able to look that child in the eye and say that I was going but she was not, especially as she was looking forward to it and this wasn't a child free event.\n\nAll of this really should have been discussed well before it was, though, and that's on both of y'all.\n\nI would suggest that both you and your friend, assuming that you are remaining on speaking terms, plan a separate day out that involves Lily.

It feels _really bad_ when you can\u2019t even use the toilet without significant assistance, and older buildings that prevent wheelchair navigation aren\u2019t necessarily going to have accessible bathrooms.\n\nUntrained people can easily damage a wheelchair by trying to move it without knowing what they are doing. Some wheelchairs are quite heavy or wide, may not collapse, and have few handholds because they aren\u2019t designed to be carried around.", "That was my thought. If being in a chair is her main handicap, and say she doesn't have a need for electricity and an IV stand, couldn't a couple people assist getting her up a flight of stairs?\n\nBathrooms may still be an issue though", "If it\u2019s only accessible via stairs, that would be enough of a barrier for a wheelchair user to not be able to attend. It doesn\u2019t take much to make a building impossible to access in a chair.", "Politeness?  I feel like if she didn't get invited, OP would have felt slighted because her daughter wasn't given an invitation just because.", "Right! Like what if Grandmom was in a wheelchair. Do we just say screw all disabled people?! Fuck I didn\u2019t realize all my friends were so insanely accommodating to me. Like, they check venues before even suggesting a concert we should go to.", "Yeah, and she cares about OP\n She doesn't need any accomodations. The fact that OP wants ro bring her child along is a different story", "Could someone carry Lily into the venue while you get the wheelchair folded to go through the door? Are there other possible workarounds for this?", "I mean she probably didn\u2019t think to ask when booking the venue.  When you\u2019re planning a wedding there are so many decisions being made and if it\u2019s not the brides daughter she wouldn\u2019t be in the habit of asking about accommodations up front.", "You're awful nice, wasting a lot of energy for an op who, not only can't be bothered to edit their post after they learned they left out pertinent information, also can't bothered to reply to requests for that information, and (most egregiously, imo) replies \"yeah\" to an and/or question. Maybe I'm just extra irked by this, but she doesn't seem interested in receiving an accurate judgement, even if doing so would likely tip things more in her favor. Or, you, know, be an **accurate judgement.**", "The daughter was invited, OP confirmed it. Her name was on the invitation", "But I think it was still an oversight to not check that their accessibility plans were going to be acceptable. For example, were they going to have a separate area for wheelchairs and where would it be located? Etc", "I'm hesitant to believe Lily was actually invited: OP has yet to answer specific questions directed at **how** that was handled, and she left it out of her post. She just keeps saying \"she was invited,\" not \"she was on the invitation and there's a spot for her on the rsvp list.\" OP's evasiveness lends credence to my theory Lily was verbally invited in the early stages of Jane's engagement (\"of course she can come!\") but not actually considered once the venue was picked.", "Maybe then someone could carry the child up the stairs and someone else carry the chair?", "That\u2019s my thought too. I can\u2019t imagine her best friend was malicious about it.  I assume she just didn\u2019t think about it", "It depends on Lily\u2019s level of accommodation. The house likely has a historical exception so they probably don\u2019t have ramps, wide doors, etc. however lily is young enough (and therefore presumably small enough) to be carried by a moderately strong person if need be. I\u2019m also assuming her mom is her primary care giver and helps her transfer from chair to bed to couch etc. so they could arrive early and get her settled wherever they are getting ready, then help her move to wherever she is sitting for the ceremony. \n\nAlso just because lily was invited doesn\u2019t mean the entire wedding/venue/etc should be catered to her. It\u2019s frustrating for sure but again. It\u2019s not Lily\u2019s mom\u2019s/grandmother/aunt/etc wedding. It\u2019s her moms friend\u2019s wedding. Unsurprising that the entire venue selection was not catered to a literal seven year old.", "I wouldn\u2019t say all the brides fault. She\u2019s at some fault yes, but so is OP for not checking until the last minute. When you require accommodations or are the person responsible for someone who does, it is also your responsibility to check into these things. You can\u2019t make assumptions that your specific needs will be accommodated correctly unless you are a part of that conversation. Presumably OP as maid of honor and best friend knew the venue well before now. It was in her power then to check it out and see what could be done for her kid. This is an oversight on both parties.", "I think it's quite a hostile take to assume someone would intentionally invite their best friend's disabled daughter knowing they can't come. Either she didn't know at that point or she's a complete lunatic psychopath and I think it's fair to assume it's the first", ">But then why invite a disabled person that you know wont be able to come?\n\nI swear a lot of people here have deep issues with [theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind), and maybe if that's your situation you shouldn't be weighing in on social matters.\n\nThe answer to your question is, it just slipped their mind. Many people have never in their lives had to deal with checking that a place can accommodate wheelchairs, they kinda just assume that everywhere is wheelchair accessible, and so they don't think about it when choosing a wedding venue.", "Do you really think she actively sought to invite someone she knew couldn't come?  Odds are she's seen multiple other businesses accommodate OPs daughter and assumed the same could be done?", "Sometimes people invite someone they know won't come to be nice. My sister invite my grandfather but the venue was a 7+ hour drive for him & she knew he wouldn't be able to come.", "7yo is still to young to leave alone, and parents of abled children still tend to hover and be distracted, much less a parent with special needs. Sitter is the logical choice, weddings are never a MUST for small children anyway. I feel like a 7yo and wheelchair could be carried to the destination, but this person has a point- was OP going to try to mind her child in the middle of her MOH duties, or is there a childcare plan so she can focus on the task at hand?", "That very much depends on the venue - and on the accommodations needed. \n\nOn a protected building, you can't just install elevators, good ramps, handrails, change the dimensions of bathrooms, make doors wider, remove thresholds and all the other things that makes a place accessible.\n\nAnd even something as seemingly simple as putting in a temporary ramp is not always so simple. \n\nIf, for example, the stairs leading up to the entrance are very steep (as they often are), you will need a very long ramp to ensure an appropriate incline. That ramp needs to be strong enough to support the weight of the wheelchair user, a helper and the wheelchair itself (and electrical ones are heavy AF), while not needing to be directly attached to the structure of the building, and be easy to put up and take down. \n\nAnd yes, I speak from experience of working at a historical site where we really wanted to make one of the buildings a bit more accessible by installing a ramp that could be put up and down as needed by one member of staff. The only option was to get a local smith to custom make one, which was way out of our budget.", "Its a historical site. It cannot be changed or damaged. Making accommodations to the historical site would be wrong", "Yeah it\u2019s sad how many comments are acting like it\u2019s soooo insane to expect accommodations for a disabled person who was explicitly invited to an event.", "I've been inviting to weddings that the people inviting me knew I couldn't afford to go to. Are they assholes for inviting me? No I think it was just a nod to the fact that they wanted me there. Doesn't always work out that way though does it. And it doesn't make me hate those people because I don't expect everybody to move heaven and earth for me because the world doesn't revolve around me.", "The OP is missing info but it's a 7 year old, perhaps the kid can be carried by parents for the areas where a wheelchair won't work and the bride assumed so?", "Have you ever planned a wedding? lol. You literally CANNOT think of absolutely everything. It's an incredibly stressful experience.", "I've been invited to weddings people knew I couldn't go to but the invite in and of itself is a kind reach out. I couldn't afford, I couldn't take the time, For some reason I was unable to come and they knew it. They still wanted me to know they wanted me there. \n\nShould I have expected all my friends to accommodate me?", "Exactly. But to her, her wedding is most important. She shouldn\u2019t have to give up a venue she loves to accommodate everyone. Personally, I would do that if I had a guest who needed accommodation but she doesn\u2019t have to.", "She\u2019s a 7 year old\u2026 op can carry her daughter, or surely another guest could. Sounds like she is trying to be a martyr on someone else\u2019s wedding day.", ">essentially rescinded the invite without telling OP until she asked\n\nThis is what makes it NTA for me. As soon as that venue was picked, the bride should have told OP about the accessibility issue. What was the brides plan? Not tell OP and let her and daughter be blindsided day of. \n\nBride should have either picked an accessibility friendly venue OR given OP a heads up to give OP the most amount of time to organise childcare. I love childfree weddings as a mother of 3, but it is hard enough to find childcare as it is, let alone one comfortable looking after a child with disability/accessibility concerns. Even if OP does have a \"usual\" babysitter there is no guarantee they would be available that day anyway.", "Yes i did read the other stuff OP wrote now and it all made Jane + Partner the AH.

Otherwhite its willfully excluding them.", "I guess it depends what people prioritise, *where* or *with who*.", "The invites can't be sent until the venue is picked. So this begs the question, Did the bride know it couldn't accommodate a wheel chair when she booked or did she find out after? Or did she simply fall in love with the venue which vetoed having a 7 year old come to the wedding?", "yes, this is confusing. If she invited her why would she assume you would not bring her?", "I think it was the able bodied assumption that disabled people don't matter. She did her duty by inviting her, but since the venue was not accessible obviously she wouldn't be able to go. But she's disabled so obviously she won't have relevant opinions on that and can safely be left with a babysitter and nobody important has to miss out.", "This!", "The bride assumed once accommodations couldn't be made for OP's daughter that OP would leave her daughter with a babysitter and still come to the wedding. \n\nBride brought up a babysitter after the daughter was unable to attend.", "But the bride said she did ask about making it handicap accessible and because of the historical status of the building, they couldn't. So what was she supposed to do? Move her entire wedding because she couldn't make changes for a bridesmaids daughter?\n\nBride should be understanding of the bridesmaid wanting to pull out of the wedding. There was a miscommunication and no one should be asked to leave their child when they aren't comfortable to do so. But you can't be mad at the bride for not being able to make changes to a venue she doesn't own. Especially if it has historical status. She probably put the name on the invitation before she knew they couldn't make the changes for her to go. \n\nIf you love her as a close friend(close enough to be in her wedding) I would say talk it out and hopefully your friend thinks about it and isn't upset about it.

In general, if a bride's best friend's child was NOT invited to a wedding that isn't child-free then there'd be issues.

It\u2019s surprising that the bride didn\u2019t consider Lily\u2018s need for her wheelchair or bring it up with OP much earlier. That\u2019s an odd disconnect for someone that has been in the child\u2018s life since she was born.", "Yea. I find it entirely.possoble the venue told her they could make it accessible, she took that at face value. And the venue just meant ramps into the building and nothing else. Or straight up lied to get the sale. It's not unheard.of", "OP's at peace with staying home. It's her friend that has a problem with it.", "i agree. Thats called bad planing. The person showing the venue to you can tell you all about it beforhand. Its not hard at all.\n\nCan we just all be honest here? Jane didnt care. We can argue if she is entitled to not care about a person she invited. But Op is definitly not the AH.", "There are portable ramps that dont need nails or whatever... we dont live in 1910, Helena.", "The wheelchair can be carried up as well.  I've seen this done for adults so I'm not sure why it would be a problem for a much smaller person.", "OP isn't asking her to change the venue though, she's just saying she won't go. She is considering the friendship I suspect not because the friend failed to consider her daughter's needs in the first place (which is disappointing, but it happens) but because of the way the friend responded when OP raised it with her.\n\nI imagine that OP has spent a lot of hours of her life advocating for access on behalf of her daughter, which is difficult and tiring work. She has probably vented to the friend about how hard this is. The friend then turned around and acted like she hadn't listened to a word of what OP has told her and like her struggles weren't worth considering. I would also reconsider the friendship over that if I were in her shoes.", "Or it\u2019s entirely possible that she wasn\u2019t thinking about her friend\u2019s daughter when picking her venue because it\u2019s literally her wedding and the kid was just not on her mind when trying to find a venue.", "And these fit inside narrow, curving staircases?  I used to live in a home build in 1753.  Something custom would need to be built. I\u2019ve been to 700 year old churches whose stairs would not accommodate this. You must not get out much.", "Not all wheelchairs are lightweight,  easy to carry, or foldable.", "The wheelchair may not fit in the building. Historic buildings often have very narrow passages and doorways. The kid is 7. You can't expect someone to carry her around all day like a doll. Disabled people deserve dignity. Would you want somebody carrying you all day at a wedding because you weren't able to walk?", "Carrying our wheelchairs up is not accessibility, nor is it a safe or suitable option.  \n\n\nMany people have been harmed and very expensive medical equipment damaged by people thinking this is a suitable \"solution\".  \n\n\nSome might be okay with the risk, but not everyone, nor should that be the only option offered.", "Some wheelchairs are relatively light weight and fold up. Others are motorised and weigh a ton. They are not easily carried anywhere", "Think about this from the perspective of safety, if a fire broke out the child would be dependant on others entirely to get to safety. As unlikely as they may be to actually happen, worst case scenarios should always be considered during event planning.", "> OP isn't asking her to change the venue though, she's just saying she won't go.\n\nShe gave her an ultimatum. Make the accommodations possible (which would be changing the venue) or I won\u2019t come. If the venue said the accommodations aren\u2019t possible, the bride can\u2019t just have someone show up and build a temporary ramp on the property or anything needed beyond that.\n\nAs I said, OP can decline to attend, but she didn\u2019t just say she wouldn\u2019t be attending. She made an ultimatum. Do this or else. So she was, in fact, asking that the venue be changed."]}
