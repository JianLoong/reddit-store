Everyone in my family knows how much I care for the privacy of my room. However, I (26f) would usually give up my bed or rather my whole room for them whenever they come over because I am single and I have no children.\n\nMy mother would always ask for them and they never once asked me themselves. There was this silent expectation that I would always say yes. Well, they are coming over this weekend for my father's and my birthday.\n\nA week ago before this weekend, my mother asked, and I said no. I told her that they can easily sleep on the air mattress in the living room or go downstairs to the movie room. My mother was somewhat shocked that I said no. She asked why and I told her that I wanted to keep my room for this weekend because I will be leaving for college right after this birthday weekend and my sleeping schedule is completely different from theirs. My family loves staying up until 2 am while hanging out in the living room. I would usually go to bed at 8 pm or 9 pm. They don't care about my sleeping schedule, because the last time I gave up my bed for almost three days, they stayed around the living room at 1 am or 3 am on those nights. I was hoping they would go to their bed early out of consideration for me but they didn't and it really fucked up my sleeping schedule.\n\nI also wanted to keep my bed for my birthday. However, over the past week, my mother and my other sister(29f) were mad at me. They would say that they would give up their bed for them but the other sister's husband said no and my father said no. I feel that they only said that to guilt me that I am selfishly not giving up my bed. I told them I am willing to give up my bed all the other times, just not this time. Then they brought up my nephew and how cold I am for making him sleep out in the living room but I told them that it's not like they're sleeping out in the forest. My mother told me that I better tell my sister that I am not letting her use the bed face to face but that made me somewhat annoyed that she told me to do that because not once did they ask me in texts, calls, and face to face.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1673705617, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bpe6d/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister24f_and_her/", "score": 1083, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was only in it for space for the kid.", "Whose house is it? Are you living with your parents? I don't agree with people having to give up their rooms usually, but it depends whose house it is. Also do you pay rent?", "Is there just 2 bedroom house? Where ur sibling slept when they were living there\n\nSs correcting spelling", "She doesn't have a man to please so clearly should please her family /s", "No penis, obviously.", "Yes. Yes. Yes. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nDefinitely NTA\n\nWrite your sister a thank you card. \u201cThank you for graciously allowing me to keep my bedroom for my birthday weekend.\u201d (They\u2019ll get the message)", "Not to mention - it's okay for her to sleep elsewhere but it's \"mean\" to make the nephew sleep there? What is she, Cinderella?", "You laugh but well someone had that actual issue not too long ago https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfxcmr/aita\\_for\\_causing\\_a\\_family\\_rift\\_because\\_i\\_dont/", "Heck, since she pays rent there, I think she should say she'd gladly give them her room while they provide a hotel room for her to sleep in as reimbursement.", "It is her room. I wouldn't let someone sleep in my kids' rooms without their permission and both of them are under 10", "Right, plus who wants to sleep in someone\u2019s room with them in the living room. I would feel so rude it would make me uncomfortable.", "Mom might promise and then do whatever she wants. It isn\u2019t worth the risk.\n\nIn reality OP\u2019s room has no reason to be the sole option Mom is considering. All of them could equally well give up their rooms. Also, the movie room should be a perfectly usable room. Maybe it\u2019s time to add a day bed or something so it doubles as a guest room.", "I am at home for winter break, which lasts a month but whenever I am at home I would pay rent if I am at home for more than 2 weeks.", "> YTA for still living at home at 26\n\nI highly disagree. If parents are welcoming, you might as well stay. You\u2019ll be far further financially ahead in that case. I\u2019ll never understand people\u2019s obsession with moving out (again, with welcoming parents) asap.", "It's moms house, but OP pays rent,  so mom has zero argument imo. \n\n\nExactly what I said. I would give up my room, BUT.. nonsense", "Cold?? \n\n\nHow did you come to that conclusion? \n\n\nOP basically said I always give up my room and or bed when they visit,  I just don't want to do it this one time...", "IMO rent shouldn't matter.  If this is their primary residence and their room, why should it be expected for someone to come in and use their space?    \n\n\nMy judgement is NTA.", "Doesn't matter who the house belongs to really, OP pays rent, so that room is paid for.", "Willing to bet this is the whole reason. Nephew has one, he gets more love.", "Especially in a house that has both a living room \\*and\\* a movie room, so I'm guessing that nobody is going cold or terribly uncomfortable anywhere in that house.", "That\u2019s a good point.", "*What the fuuuuuuuuuu*", "absolutely insane lmao", "I hope OP didn\u2019t go. Going to a place where everyone and everything is prioritized over someone would suck.", "I don\u2019t even live with my parents anymore and they still ask if it\u2019s okay to have guests sleep in my old room", "Wait wait wait - you pay rent when you VISIT home for the winter break???  And during these visits, for which you pay rent, others can visit for free and take your room??\n\nYou are NTA.  And your family is insane.", "NTA if you're paying rent to your FAMILY for your CHILDHOOD BEDROOM using STUDENT LOANS you'll literally be paying off your family's cruelty for decades. It's mind-boggling to me that they think it's acceptable to charge you rent for petty periods of time from your super high-interest preciously limited student loans. Huge yikes.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Didn't see that in the original post. If you pay rent, f**k the sister.", "I spent a summer sleeping on an air mattress (cause it was in a room far from everyone else and I liked feeling like I was living on my own (even though I was just home from college lol). \n\nMy parents *still* asked if my grandma could take my room for the week she was there.

And she\u2019s right, they will have a nice place to sleep and if it bothers the sister and her family then they can get a hotel room.", "I don't think that's cold at all, OP was just giving mom a response to the bullshit mom was trying to feed her. \n\n\nAnd let's be honest here, most kids will sleep most anywhere!\n\n\nSleeping on the living room floor for a few nights is not the end of the world.", "Plenty of parents help their kids out through college and even grad school. OP said she was going back to school and \u201chelping out\u201d could mean more than just financial contribution.\n\nAlso edit: OP does pay rent to her parents. So\u2026 that\u2019s literally her rented room.", "So it's none of our business what OP's financial agreement is.  Obviously if they are paying rent, then that space is legally theirs and their landlords/parents have no business asking or expecting use of that room.  But even if this is their childhood home, and they are living rent free while going to school, it is still 'their space' and they shouldn't be expected to share their space if they don't want to."]}
