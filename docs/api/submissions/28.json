My \u201cnerdy\u201d hobbies became \u201cquirky\u201d instead of being made fun of. I told her about my ED and my relapses.\n\nShe wanted to go through with it. We made a Pinterest board. I tried to follow a makeup tutorial to achieve a new look for her. Results were good and I let her borrow my clothes & took Instagram pictures since she wanted to share her new look. \n\nI was happy that she was happy. I used my products for the past months. I made a beauty box for her birthday using drug-store and high-end products. Total was $120+ but she meant more than that to me. After that, whenever I go to her room, the box is left untouched.\n\nIt takes me 45-60 minutes to do her makeup. I\u2019d work on hers first before mine when going out.

I said she shouldn\u2019t be a spoiled entitled brat, expecting to be spoon fed since I gave her all the resources. She stormed out of my room in tears.\n\nOur mutual friends ripped me apart. She reposted a TikTok about friends sabotaging each other when one\u2019s doing well and tagged me on her public story. I didn\u2019t engage with her and blocked her. \n\nWe haven\u2019t talked in two weeks and she came knocking on my door, begging me to do her makeup for Halloweekend since she\u2019s partying with her friends. This was the first time she apologized to me and I just told her no. She made a scene outside my dorm. As an RA, I couldn\u2019t have someone crying in public and disturbing my residents. \n\nI let her in, gave her some tissues and water to calm down. She kept saying sorry and I just asked her why she\u2019s here. She said that she can\u2019t do her makeup perfectly like how I helped her. I told her that she\u2019s on her own and she needs to leave. She\u2019s on her knees and begged me to help her since she doesn\u2019t have much time to get ready. I told her to stop and that I\u2019m sick, so I want to lay in bed for the night. She wouldn\u2019t stop screaming, so I told her to stop unless she\u2019d like me to call University Police. She said I was abusing my power and that she would report me. I encouraged her to go for it since anyone can call UP or talk with the Resident Directors. \n\nAt this point, I just wanted peace and quiet since I had a raging headache and coughing like there\u2019s no tomorrow.
