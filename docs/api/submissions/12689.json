I certainly wouldn't stick around for this nonsense.", "NTA. Your friend is right, your gf is toxic (and maybe a little bit looney). I think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re close enough with your half siblings that you don\u2019t find the need to emphasise on the \u201chalf\u201d.

Toxic drama queen who sounds extremely insecure if they think that you're hiding something because of this bizarro situation.", "NTA.\n\nSo because you didn\u2019t disclose your entire family\u2019s biological history she thinks you\u2019re cheating on her?\n\nWhat?", "NTA. Some people feel separated from half siblings and specify that separation. Others feel just as close with half siblings and dont feel the need for the distinction. You seem to be the latter and nta for that.", "NTA at all. I mean, you consider then as your siblings as well, \"half siblings\" it's just a label.

One is a half sister. One is a full.\n\nIt was awhile before he told me. I didn\u2019t bat an eye because he has always viewed her as his sister.

It seems like she could be projecting.", "NTA they are your family you consider them your family there's nothing wrong with saying they're your siblings just because you have a different mother I have a similar relationship with my brother we may have different mothers but we are close brothers. However I do believe the girlfriend is an asshole for her reaction and behavior to this and your friend is right she is toxic.", "Nta, your gf is ridiculous.

Dump her now, especially with her \"real family\" parting shot. You and your half-siblings are definitely siblings even if you share just one parent.

I love that you don\u2019t think of them as \u201chalf\u201d siblings but simply your siblings. It sounds like you guys have a good relationship. Given all the step/half-sibling stories here on AITA, this is a nice change. \n\nThis is a really weird hill for your GF to die on. Also, she clearly doesn\u2019t think half-siblings are siblings, and I\u2019m curious how she reacts to them going forward. \n\nAt 19 she\u2019s young. I hope she matures and this is something that makes her cringe in the future. But in the meantime, you did nothing wrong.

If you look at us it's very noticeable we are not biologically related, but I call him my brother, and will have words with anyone who tries to say otherwise.\n\nNTA and your girlfriend appears to have presented you with a nice shiny new red flag.....", "Almost sounds like she just wanted to have a fight over something and picked this. I have half-sisters and guess what I call them? My sisters. It has never been an issue with literally anyone.", "NTA.\n\nYour GF does sound like she has some major issues, though.  I don't want to call her toxic on this limited information because in a situation like this there might be some family trauma involved--but unless she is willing to apologize and sit down and talk things out, I'd consider this a gigantic red flag,", "NTA, And i am guessing that she just wanted to go through your phone and shit but got mad when the excuse didn't work.", "NTA. Even at the best possible interpretation of her before or views, the most that can be said for her is that different people have different ideas about what the term \"sibling\" means. I introduce my brother to everyone and it often takes months before something gives me reason to remember to mention that he's not actually any blood relative to me at all -- we just chose each other. I hate to think what your girlfriend's view of *that* would be. \n\nYour definition is perfectly reasonable. It may not be the only reasonable definition of a sibling (though I think it's a kinder one than hers) but it's 100% okay. If your girlfriend's reaction to it is to decide you must be cheating on her because you did something \"untrustworthy\" by using one entirely reasonable word for that relationship instead of a different, also reasonable word for it, she has deeper problems than what you and your siblings call each other.", "NTA and that's a level of crazy you want to try your very best to avoid, my friend.", "All I know is, I want to come to grandmas house lol.", "\u201cI just dumped my insecure and controlling girlfriend, who probably shouldn\u2019t be dating, because she still has issues from her previous relationship. AITA?\u201c", "You're NTA but sounds like your gf is TA.  Siblings don't need to be labelled as half, step, etc if you don't want to. People who do that have reasons, usually some family tension where they don't feel the full sibling bond and that's okay too. You're lucky in your situation where they're just your siblings.\n\nI thought it was awesome when I was in my early 20's and it finally clicked for me that my eldest uncle had a different last name than my father because they had different fathers. So I finally asked and found out that my aunt and him were born first, my Oma lost her husband then remarried. There was zero way to tell  by way of interaction within the family. I was just slow at noticing the different name. It's sad that your gf wasn't just like cool, they are close and don't care for the half designation.", "NTA. half siblings are siblings, your girlfriend is being obtuse and completely overreacting, and I think your best friend is right. besides the fact that she's completely incorrect to say they aren't siblings, to go from \"he didn't tell me his siblings had a different mom\" to \"he must be cheating on me and I have a right to look through his phone\" is an enormous red flag.", "NTA. If she didn't' pick up on the family dynamics then either she wasn't listening or you didn't go over it very well, but thinking you were hiding it like a huge family secret is not normal. Consider this the crazy trash taking itself out. \n\nIt's also possible that she's projecting her own secrets/insecurities, or that she was looking for a way to mess up the relationship and this turned out to be a convenient point of contention.", "NTA, but... she's showing you who she is. Believe her. Get out now.", "NTA. Take your friend's advice and let her go.", "NTA. She's got a take on life and family that I wouldn't want to be around.", "NTA. She needs to be an ex. She is weird and judgmental.", "Father of 4 here of which only one is mine biologically. I raised ALL of them since the oldest was 7 (she\u2019s 35 now).

I they are your siblings.", "NTA - she was looking for an exit and contrived one to make it \u201cyour\u201d fault. That\u2019s the only explanation.

Sounds about right.", "You are NTA and your girlfriend's view is weird", "NTA in any way shape or form.  I have 2 \"half-siblings\" but I never refer to them as such.  They're my sisters.  Your girlfriend sounds cuckoo for cocoa puffs and it's probably a good thing you found out about it now rather than later.  You're both young and she sounds like the jealous type.  You won't ever have any peace with her.", "NTA.  \n\nYour girlfriend has a very narrow and rigid definition of family and some remarkable trust issues.", "NTA. I have one full-sibling, the rest are technically half siblings. I never differentiate because it makes no difference to me - the closest I get is saying how many siblings I've got from my mom's side, and how many on my father's side since they've both had kids with people other than each other.\n\nIf I introduced any of my \"half siblings\", I wouldn't bother differentiating at all. A brother is a brother, a sister is a sister.\n\nA very odd response from your girlfriend, and I agree that her behavior is unhealthy. Freaking out, storming out and then giving you silent treatment are not constructive ways to handle conflict in a relationship.", "NTA. We all define family for ourselves. Your girlfriend sounds a little unhinged. I would consider this a significant red flag and though I\u2019m hesitant to jump to the usual AITA answer of dump her, I would really recommend that you reconsider your relationship as I can\u2019t imagine being with someone like her.

Just went, oh ok, good to know, and continued on with her day.  I wasn't hiding it from her, but had she reacted like your gf, I would have probably dumped her.

Nobody who throws an accusation like that has nothing to hide. \nIt\u2019s ridiculous to imply that a half-sibling isn\u2019t a sibling. I\u2019d get out of there while you can my dude", "Easy NTA, and your girlfriend's reaction here is kind of alarming.", "NTA but seriously don\u2019t be with her! She is very unhinged and needs help. I would say just let her ignore you, you dodged a bullet", "Your best friend is right. She\u2019s toxic. Lucky you found out now. NTA", "NTA\n\nyour gf is being an ass, but I might give her a pass if she's been kinda sheltered, like hasn't been around blended families, like she's still young and dumb. Irrational toxic reactions can be OK if they're rare. As long as she's willing to work through her closed-mindedness. I'm proud of u for enforcing your boundaries! (not giving over your phone)", "Nta. \n\nMy kids have different dads but I don\u2019t say \u201cgo tell your half brother dinner is ready \u201c that is just weird siblings are siblings no matter the genetics you\u2019ve all been raised together same goes for adopted children in my eyes relationships make family not dna", "NTA\n\n\nYour friend is right about gf being toxic or something close to it. With the whole \"what else are you hiding\" and demanding phone access, perhaps she had been waiting to find a reason to manipulate you into giving her your phone.\n\nAlso half-siblings literally has the word sibling in it. What is her logic...???", "NTA, it\u2019s awesome that you never even thought about call them \u201chalf siblings\u201d.", "All of my 8 siblings are half. I have never called them \"my half siblings\" as it's very disrespectful and it doesn't matter if we have different dads. I love them all the same. (My 5 older siblings have the same dad, then he passed away, my mum got with my dad and only had me, after they broke up, 8 years later mum has 3 more kids with my stepdad)", "The sudden \"you lied so I need to check your phone\" sounds like classic projection and she was just itch for an excuse to start invading her privacy.", ">The fact that you describe your half-siblings as your \u201csiblings\u201d and \u201csisters\u201d just speaks to the relationship you have with them. It\u2019s sweet, really.\n\nNot really its just a fact that they are genetically siblings...\n\nVery strange how some people act like half-siblings are the same as step siblings", "My family tree is complicated enough (everyone getting multiple divorces and kids are all across generations), I just call my half siblings my siblings because that's easier. We're not even close.  \nIt's bad enough my cousins son is older than me and my favourite aunt isn't even related to the family, and another \"aunt\" is so distantly related we can't even trace down that side of the family tree. Let me be. I can save a whole word when referring to my siblings, I'm going to save that word. Everyone is either \"aunt\" \"cousin\" or \"sibling\".", " It honestly would never have occurred to me to think of my brother as a half-brother, even though we had different biological fathers.", "Yeah anyone who expects me to be at a party at 5:30am is just getting a laugh. A big long incredulous laugh. I won\u2019t even get up that early on Christmas morning, I\u2019m not getting up that early for a family get together"]}
