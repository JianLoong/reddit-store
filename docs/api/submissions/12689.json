I certainly wouldn't stick around for this nonsense.", "NTA. Your friend is right, your gf is toxic (and maybe a little bit looney). I think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re close enough with your half siblings that you don\u2019t find the need to emphasise on the \u201chalf\u201d.

Toxic drama queen who sounds extremely insecure if they think that you're hiding something because of this bizarro situation.", "NTA.\n\nSo because you didn\u2019t disclose your entire family\u2019s biological history she thinks you\u2019re cheating on her?\n\nWhat?", "NTA. Some people feel separated from half siblings and specify that separation. Others feel just as close with half siblings and dont feel the need for the distinction. You seem to be the latter and nta for that.", "NTA at all. I mean, you consider then as your siblings as well, \"half siblings\" it's just a label.

One is a half sister. One is a full.\n\nIt was awhile before he told me. I didn\u2019t bat an eye because he has always viewed her as his sister.

It seems like she could be projecting.", "NTA they are your family you consider them your family there's nothing wrong with saying they're your siblings just because you have a different mother I have a similar relationship with my brother we may have different mothers but we are close brothers. However I do believe the girlfriend is an asshole for her reaction and behavior to this and your friend is right she is toxic.", "Nta, your gf is ridiculous.

Dump her now, especially with her \"real family\" parting shot. You and your half-siblings are definitely siblings even if you share just one parent.

I love that you don\u2019t think of them as \u201chalf\u201d siblings but simply your siblings. It sounds like you guys have a good relationship. Given all the step/half-sibling stories here on AITA, this is a nice change. \n\nThis is a really weird hill for your GF to die on. Also, she clearly doesn\u2019t think half-siblings are siblings, and I\u2019m curious how she reacts to them going forward. \n\nAt 19 she\u2019s young. I hope she matures and this is something that makes her cringe in the future. But in the meantime, you did nothing wrong.

If you look at us it's very noticeable we are not biologically related, but I call him my brother, and will have words with anyone who tries to say otherwise.\n\nNTA and your girlfriend appears to have presented you with a nice shiny new red flag.....", "Almost sounds like she just wanted to have a fight over something and picked this. I have half-sisters and guess what I call them? My sisters. It has never been an issue with literally anyone.", "NTA.\n\nYour GF does sound like she has some major issues, though.  I don't want to call her toxic on this limited information because in a situation like this there might be some family trauma involved--but unless she is willing to apologize and sit down and talk things out, I'd consider this a gigantic red flag,", "NTA, And i am guessing that she just wanted to go through your phone and shit but got mad when the excuse didn't work.", "NTA. Even at the best possible interpretation of her before or views, the most that can be said for her is that different people have different ideas about what the term \"sibling\" means. I introduce my brother to everyone and it often takes months before something gives me reason to remember to mention that he's not actually any blood relative to me at all -- we just chose each other. I hate to think what your girlfriend's view of *that* would be. \n\nYour definition is perfectly reasonable. It may not be the only reasonable definition of a sibling (though I think it's a kinder one than hers) but it's 100% okay. If your girlfriend's reaction to it is to decide you must be cheating on her because you did something \"untrustworthy\" by using one entirely reasonable word for that relationship instead of a different, also reasonable word for it, she has deeper problems than what you and your siblings call each other.", "NTA and that's a level of crazy you want to try your very best to avoid, my friend.", "All I know is, I want to come to grandmas house lol.", "\u201cI just dumped my insecure and controlling girlfriend, who probably shouldn\u2019t be dating, because she still has issues from her previous relationship. AITA?\u201c", "You're NTA but sounds like your gf is TA.  Siblings don't need to be labelled as half, step, etc if you don't want to. People who do that have reasons, usually some family tension where they don't feel the full sibling bond and that's okay too. You're lucky in your situation where they're just your siblings.\n\nI thought it was awesome when I was in my early 20's and it finally clicked for me that my eldest uncle had a different last name than my father because they had different fathers. So I finally asked and found out that my aunt and him were born first, my Oma lost her husband then remarried. There was zero way to tell  by way of interaction within the family. I was just slow at noticing the different name. It's sad that your gf wasn't just like cool, they are close and don't care for the half designation.", "NTA. half siblings are siblings, your girlfriend is being obtuse and completely overreacting, and I think your best friend is right. besides the fact that she's completely incorrect to say they aren't siblings, to go from \"he didn't tell me his siblings had a different mom\" to \"he must be cheating on me and I have a right to look through his phone\" is an enormous red flag.", "NTA. If she didn't' pick up on the family dynamics then either she wasn't listening or you didn't go over it very well, but thinking you were hiding it like a huge family secret is not normal. Consider this the crazy trash taking itself out. \n\nIt's also possible that she's projecting her own secrets/insecurities, or that she was looking for a way to mess up the relationship and this turned out to be a convenient point of contention.", "NTA, but... she's showing you who she is. Believe her. Get out now.", "NTA. Take your friend's advice and let her go.", "NTA. She's got a take on life and family that I wouldn't want to be around.", "NTA. She needs to be an ex. She is weird and judgmental.", "Father of 4 here of which only one is mine biologically. I raised ALL of them since the oldest was 7 (she\u2019s 35 now).

I they are your siblings.", "NTA - she was looking for an exit and contrived one to make it \u201cyour\u201d fault. That\u2019s the only explanation.

Sounds about right.", "You are NTA and your girlfriend's view is weird", "NTA in any way shape or form.  I have 2 \"half-siblings\" but I never refer to them as such.  They're my sisters.  Your girlfriend sounds cuckoo for cocoa puffs and it's probably a good thing you found out about it now rather than later.  You're both young and she sounds like the jealous type.  You won't ever have any peace with her.", "NTA.  \n\nYour girlfriend has a very narrow and rigid definition of family and some remarkable trust issues.", "NTA. I have one full-sibling, the rest are technically half siblings. I never differentiate because it makes no difference to me - the closest I get is saying how many siblings I've got from my mom's side, and how many on my father's side since they've both had kids with people other than each other.\n\nIf I introduced any of my \"half siblings\", I wouldn't bother differentiating at all. A brother is a brother, a sister is a sister.\n\nA very odd response from your girlfriend, and I agree that her behavior is unhealthy. Freaking out, storming out and then giving you silent treatment are not constructive ways to handle conflict in a relationship.", "NTA. We all define family for ourselves. Your girlfriend sounds a little unhinged. I would consider this a significant red flag and though I\u2019m hesitant to jump to the usual AITA answer of dump her, I would really recommend that you reconsider your relationship as I can\u2019t imagine being with someone like her.

I only include the \u201chalf\u201d when talking to someone and an using it for the sake of clarity.\n\nShe\u2019s being ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nI have an older half-sister but always just said sister. Sure, there were questions about last names (had different ones) and looks (she looks like bio-dad's side and I'm our mom's twin) but otherwise, she was my sister. I have to agree with your best friend though. \"Real family\" is who you decide is your family and sometimes has nothing to do with genetics.", ">when I spoke to my best friend she said that my gfs toxic and I need to get away from her\n\nYour best friend is the real one here, because she see's your girlfriend for what she is.\n\nLook, those are your siblings. It doesn't matter if you only have one parent in common, because oodles of families are mixed up between parents. What matters is the bond between you, and even if they were just step siblings or adopted siblings they'd still be your family.\n\nYour girlfriend freaked out over **nothing** and then **demanded**, not asked, **demanded** to take an invasive plunge into your phone to see that you're \"honest.\" This isn't a healthy dynamic, and her having such a tantrum before buggering off to her \"real family\" was not a good look.\n\nI sincerely think you should just cut this one off, because you're young and life is too short to be placating this sort of nonsense.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI have trouble to understand your gf. They are your siblings. Them being \u201chalf\u201d is not changing it, it\u2019s just a detail that one finds out with time in a relationship which is what happened to her. There were no lies. You just didn\u2019t present her with your whole family history from the start which most people don\u2019t\u2026", "op=NTA\n\nAs presented your Best friend is correct.  Your GF's behavior comes across very badly(\ud83d\udea9).\n\nWould you need to tell her if one of your siblings was adopted? What other information do you need to divulge to be \"honest\"?\n\nHow she reacted makes her the A-H.  It's one thing to say, hey I didn't realize your sibling(s) had a different mother.  How did that affect your childhood?  That is a reasonable question.  Accusing you of lying because you didn't spell out every detail of your family tree is idiotic.  It clearly isn't an issue for you.  \n\nThat she then wanted access to your phone to \"prove\" your honesty?  BIG NOPE.  \n\nConsider what other \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 she shows.  She may be doing you a favor, going to stay with \"real family\".", "NTA even if for some reason it really bothered her, she was over the top in her reaction", "She\u2019s being weird. I have a half sister (different dads) and I have always considered her just as much a sister as the one with whom I share both parents. Most of our friends growing up assumed we had the same parents.", "Your gf seems to have trust issues. She needs to understand that you didn't call them your half siblings because you see them as your siblings. You weren't really hiding anything. I assume if it came up naturally you would have mentioned it. NTA. You guys need to talk. Trust is a very important part of relationships. If your gf can't trust it's not going to work out.", "I think she over reacted. You don\u2019t have a distinction between half siblings and full siblings. Not that big a deal. However I am wondering how she went a whole year into your relationship without gaining a better understanding of your family dynamics?", "NTA This is about something but it was not about your siblings. And seriously what a delusional point of view. She wanted your phone. Was willing to pick a fight, ANY FIGHT, as an excuse. Then tried being manipulated. She does sound toxic.", "I've got 2 sisters and two brothers. Only one of the 4 are fully related to me in that sense. But I only call the one whom I didn't grow up in the same house with 'half'. People get weird about labels. NTA", "NTA. Your girlfriend is a real piece of work", "NTA!! Lol WTF?? Ur gf is missing a few screws they are ur siblings. Is she going to throw a fit every time u refer to them as ur siblings?? Save ur self the headaches.", "NTA", "Nta", "I agree completely. I do not call my youngest sister my \u201chalf\u201d sister. I hate even having to explain it because it almost feels like I am reducing our relationship or something. IDK she is my sister. \n\nOP - NTA it is a tiny bit odd that it never came up that they have a different mom in a year of dating. Especially if there mom is present in their lives. But not anything to freak out about.", "Learning that some of your SO's family are half-related is at most an interesting (but hardly unusual) quirk and the fact that your SO did not previously think to disclose this does not constitute a trust violation on their part.", "My kids used to get so mad when I call their brothers their half-brothers. And I hardly ever do! I only do it when I\u2019m clarifying something in a conversation. But they do NOT like it. They don\u2019t get mad like they used to, but they still don\u2019t like it.", "Maybe even added that she's abusive!"]}
