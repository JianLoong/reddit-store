I certainly wouldn't stick around for this nonsense.", "NTA. Your friend is right, your gf is toxic (and maybe a little bit looney). I think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re close enough with your half siblings that you don\u2019t find the need to emphasise on the \u201chalf\u201d.

Toxic drama queen who sounds extremely insecure if they think that you're hiding something because of this bizarro situation.", "NTA.\n\nSo because you didn\u2019t disclose your entire family\u2019s biological history she thinks you\u2019re cheating on her?\n\nWhat?", "NTA. Some people feel separated from half siblings and specify that separation. Others feel just as close with half siblings and dont feel the need for the distinction. You seem to be the latter and nta for that.", "NTA at all. I mean, you consider then as your siblings as well, \"half siblings\" it's just a label.

One is a half sister. One is a full.\n\nIt was awhile before he told me. I didn\u2019t bat an eye because he has always viewed her as his sister.

It seems like she could be projecting.", "NTA they are your family you consider them your family there's nothing wrong with saying they're your siblings just because you have a different mother I have a similar relationship with my brother we may have different mothers but we are close brothers. However I do believe the girlfriend is an asshole for her reaction and behavior to this and your friend is right she is toxic.", "Nta, your gf is ridiculous.

Dump her now, especially with her \"real family\" parting shot. You and your half-siblings are definitely siblings even if you share just one parent.

I love that you don\u2019t think of them as \u201chalf\u201d siblings but simply your siblings. It sounds like you guys have a good relationship. Given all the step/half-sibling stories here on AITA, this is a nice change. \n\nThis is a really weird hill for your GF to die on. Also, she clearly doesn\u2019t think half-siblings are siblings, and I\u2019m curious how she reacts to them going forward. \n\nAt 19 she\u2019s young. I hope she matures and this is something that makes her cringe in the future. But in the meantime, you did nothing wrong.

If you look at us it's very noticeable we are not biologically related, but I call him my brother, and will have words with anyone who tries to say otherwise.\n\nNTA and your girlfriend appears to have presented you with a nice shiny new red flag.....", "Almost sounds like she just wanted to have a fight over something and picked this. I have half-sisters and guess what I call them? My sisters. It has never been an issue with literally anyone.", "NTA.\n\nYour GF does sound like she has some major issues, though.  I don't want to call her toxic on this limited information because in a situation like this there might be some family trauma involved--but unless she is willing to apologize and sit down and talk things out, I'd consider this a gigantic red flag,", "NTA, And i am guessing that she just wanted to go through your phone and shit but got mad when the excuse didn't work.", "NTA. Even at the best possible interpretation of her before or views, the most that can be said for her is that different people have different ideas about what the term \"sibling\" means. I introduce my brother to everyone and it often takes months before something gives me reason to remember to mention that he's not actually any blood relative to me at all -- we just chose each other. I hate to think what your girlfriend's view of *that* would be. \n\nYour definition is perfectly reasonable. It may not be the only reasonable definition of a sibling (though I think it's a kinder one than hers) but it's 100% okay. If your girlfriend's reaction to it is to decide you must be cheating on her because you did something \"untrustworthy\" by using one entirely reasonable word for that relationship instead of a different, also reasonable word for it, she has deeper problems than what you and your siblings call each other.", "NTA and that's a level of crazy you want to try your very best to avoid, my friend.", "All I know is, I want to come to grandmas house lol.", "\u201cI just dumped my insecure and controlling girlfriend, who probably shouldn\u2019t be dating, because she still has issues from her previous relationship. AITA?\u201c", "You're NTA but sounds like your gf is TA.  Siblings don't need to be labelled as half, step, etc if you don't want to. People who do that have reasons, usually some family tension where they don't feel the full sibling bond and that's okay too. You're lucky in your situation where they're just your siblings.\n\nI thought it was awesome when I was in my early 20's and it finally clicked for me that my eldest uncle had a different last name than my father because they had different fathers. So I finally asked and found out that my aunt and him were born first, my Oma lost her husband then remarried. There was zero way to tell  by way of interaction within the family. I was just slow at noticing the different name. It's sad that your gf wasn't just like cool, they are close and don't care for the half designation.", "NTA. half siblings are siblings, your girlfriend is being obtuse and completely overreacting, and I think your best friend is right. besides the fact that she's completely incorrect to say they aren't siblings, to go from \"he didn't tell me his siblings had a different mom\" to \"he must be cheating on me and I have a right to look through his phone\" is an enormous red flag.", "NTA. If she didn't' pick up on the family dynamics then either she wasn't listening or you didn't go over it very well, but thinking you were hiding it like a huge family secret is not normal. Consider this the crazy trash taking itself out. \n\nIt's also possible that she's projecting her own secrets/insecurities, or that she was looking for a way to mess up the relationship and this turned out to be a convenient point of contention.", "NTA, but... she's showing you who she is. Believe her. Get out now.", "NTA. Take your friend's advice and let her go.", "NTA. She's got a take on life and family that I wouldn't want to be around.", "NTA. She needs to be an ex. She is weird and judgmental.", "Father of 4 here of which only one is mine biologically. I raised ALL of them since the oldest was 7 (she\u2019s 35 now).

I they are your siblings.", "NTA - she was looking for an exit and contrived one to make it \u201cyour\u201d fault. That\u2019s the only explanation.

Sounds about right.", "You are NTA and your girlfriend's view is weird", "NTA in any way shape or form.  I have 2 \"half-siblings\" but I never refer to them as such.  They're my sisters.  Your girlfriend sounds cuckoo for cocoa puffs and it's probably a good thing you found out about it now rather than later.  You're both young and she sounds like the jealous type.  You won't ever have any peace with her.", "NTA.  \n\nYour girlfriend has a very narrow and rigid definition of family and some remarkable trust issues.", "NTA. I have one full-sibling, the rest are technically half siblings. I never differentiate because it makes no difference to me - the closest I get is saying how many siblings I've got from my mom's side, and how many on my father's side since they've both had kids with people other than each other.\n\nIf I introduced any of my \"half siblings\", I wouldn't bother differentiating at all. A brother is a brother, a sister is a sister.\n\nA very odd response from your girlfriend, and I agree that her behavior is unhealthy. Freaking out, storming out and then giving you silent treatment are not constructive ways to handle conflict in a relationship.", "NTA. We all define family for ourselves. Your girlfriend sounds a little unhinged. I would consider this a significant red flag and though I\u2019m hesitant to jump to the usual AITA answer of dump her, I would really recommend that you reconsider your relationship as I can\u2019t imagine being with someone like her.

Not all family is defined by blood and it's ridiculous to try to box everything emotional up tidily all the time", "Unless I'm actively teasing him about bein my uncle-brother (mom's oldest that she gave up because my father refused to raise a child that wasn't his in his home and our grandparents adopted) it doesn't even register with me that he's technically my half-brother. I've always introduced him as my brother cause that's what he is.", "I have two younger brothers. We have different fathers but since mine wasn't in the picture my stepdad took up the slack. Except he's not my stepfather, he's my dad. My half brothers have never ever been half brothers, they are my brothers.\n\nAnd while we are at it, on the paternal side they were grandparents, aunt's, uncles and cousins. Not a step or half among them.", "I didn\u2019t make that connection but it totally sound like she just wanted ops phone to snoop through", "Ahh this is spot on.", "hey, OP said she's female at the beginning, just so you know", "I get it from their perspective. 3 of my siblings are half and another one is adopted\u2026but they\u2019re still my siblings either way and I never saw the point about clarifying it, cause what difference (or benefit) does clarifying really make aside from know we only share 1 parent?\n\nI remember when I was like 13, and someone had the same view as ops gf and said \u201cso they aren\u2019t your siblings, they\u2019re half siblings.\u201d And I was like no, they\u2019re my siblings. I don\u2019t care if we have different moms. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this as an attack to you or anything, but I get it lol.", "My aunt got grounded for calling her grandmother an \"Old arsed liar!\" when her grandma insisted that her older brother was her half brother and not her full brother. Its just a funny story now. But 60 years ago, my aunt gladly took the punishment and her grandma learned to never say that out loud again.", "Is it just me or does this make it worse? \n\nLike say they lived happily ever after and decided they wanted children.  IVF, not always having the same sperm donor so would their children not be siblings. Or if they used the same sperm donor but each of them used an egg. They have different mums are they not siblings. \n\nThe more you think about how it could play out in the future the more the GF either has really crap views about family or was it's even more proof that she wanted to look through OPs phone and basically tried to make op feel like the bad guy for nothing and to think she would give it.", "Oh, I get it. Which why I ONLY say it when clarifying. Like if I\u2019ve already said I have 2 kids and then they start talking about their younger brothers and the person looks at me weird. (Which I always find strange. I mean, it\u2019s 2023, wouldn\u2019t it be obvious? But apparently it\u2019s not.)", "I never correct them. I only use it in situations where people seem to need clarification. \n\nI have learned to say \u201con their dad\u2019s side\u201d or \u201cthey have a different mom\u201d as those don\u2019t seem to bother them.", "hey, wanted to let you know OP said she's a female", "I just let \u2018em figure it out lol. \n\nThought to be a bit stereotypical, it\u2019s not uncommon in my culture to have different parents. I have 8 other cousins and only 4 of them (brother and sister and 2 brothers) have the same parents. Rest of us have different fathers lol.", "Maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019ll start doing. Just let them be confused and keep going. It really is their problem. \n\nCan\u2019t believe I never thought of this before. Lol", "NTA \n\nI can see why she is your best friend- because she is right. \n\nYour siblings are you siblings, no one can change that. You didn\u2019t lie about anything", "When I was young, this was just the norm!", "NTA, they are your siblings, the half doesn\u2019t matter.  If they were adopted, it wouldn\u2019t matter.  If you were are Foster children, it wouldn\u2019t matter.  All that matters is that to you they are your siblings\u2026that is all that matters.  I agree with your best friend and think your gf is toxic.", "NTA. RUN! Your GF is off her rocker and you are too young to be in any relationship with her crazy.", "Honey, she is showing you who she is. Please listen to her. This whole thing is one big red flag. NTA. Find someone less unhinged.", "This sounds like something my ex would have done. Does your partner have borderline personality disorder?", ">she started yelling at me saying that if I was hiding that from her then what else was I hiding and that she wanted my phone \n\nThat\u2019s what this was about. She was looking for a reason to not trust you and reason to justify snooping. \n\nYour bestie is right. Your girlfriend IS toxic. Most blended families can only dream of the relationship you have with yours. \n\nBreak up with the girlfriend and know you are NTA.", ">she started yelling at me saying that if I was hiding that from her then what else was I hiding and that she wanted my phone\n\nYour best friend is right, this is super weird. Sounds like she\u2019s been looking for an excuse to go through your phone or cause problems and jumped on the first thing that came up. NTA.", "Your best friend is right. Your gf is being toxic . She's using this as a reason to go through your phone . NTA\n\n^and ^there ^is ^a ^chance ^that ^gf ^is ^cheating", "NTA half siblings are still blood related siblings,  step siblings are still sibling especially if you grew up together from a young age,  she doesn't get to dictate how you feel and the lable you use with your family,  I think BF is right", "NTA but sounds like she had some real trust issues probably stemming from shit in her past. Obviously not an excuse but maybe something to work through if you\u2019re up for it", "You are definitely NTA!\nI have 2 daughters by 2 men. My oldest daughter \u201cS\u201d was with a long term boyfriend, while my youngest daughter \u201cT\u201d was with my ex husband. T\u2019s father is African American and S\u2019s is not. One of the first days of kindergarten a little boy one the playground asked S why she was hanging around T so much. S replied that T was her sister. We never made an issue of step parents or half siblings in my family, everyone is family. The little boy told S that T couldn\u2019t be her sister because she was brown. Before I could make my way over to them S gave that little boy such a talking to he almost cried. I could not have been more proud. Little boy\u2019s mom tried to tell me I need to control my kids and I told her that she needed to explain diversity to her kid and do her best not to raise a racist asshole. We never saw them on the playground again.", "NTA, and huge red flag from your gf. How long before she flies off the handle about something else you've \"lied about\" or \"hidden from\" her?", "NTA - my oldest brother is a half brother. I never tell people that. He\u2019s my brother. Why do I have to specify? It\u2019s not lying. He\u2019s my brother. My kids are half siblings and they never say \u201cthat\u2019s my half brother/sister\u201d. Just \u201cmy brother/sister\u201d\n\nHow were you lying? You said they were your siblings. They are your siblings. She met them all and I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s so unhinged about this? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re hiding a secret family here.. \n\nYour gf does sound toxic.", "NTA your friend is right. You're girlfriend is toxic. There's absolutely nothing wrong to referring to your half siblings as siblings. There's something wrong with her if she has an issue with this. I wonder if she's cheating since she's so quick to accuse you.", "Nta! My daughters have different dads, but they are sisters. We don\u2019t do step/half/bio/adopted in our family  family is family, regardless of blood or biology.", "Both my sisters are half-siblings, but I never think of them that way. Your gf is being rude and unreasonable leaving over something like that. Maybe she is toxic.", "NTA and holy red flag.", "NTA.  \n\nHalf and step siblings are still siblings.  Period.\n\nYeah, best friend is correct.  Be thankfull you found out your (hopefully) ex-gf was \"toxic\" and off-kilter.  What else is she gonna flat-out lie about next??", "NTA,  there is nothing wrong with calling your siblings your siblings without classifying the complete relationship half/full/step.  You are able to call your siblings whatever you want.  \n\nI have grandkids that have a different mom than the others.  They all say brothers/sisters, not half anything.   I also call all the grandkids my \"grandkids\" without saying step anything.  I have good friends that I call sister and growing up had Aunts/Uncles that weren't even related by any type of that, just really good friends of the parents.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is crazy. Run.", "OP I have 3 sisters. We only share a dad. I have 3 brothers but they are only related by my dad and their mom marrying. They are still my siblings regardless.\n\nYour gf IS toxic and you really need to rethink things if she reacts this badly.", "NTA\n\nMy man take what I'm about to say very seriously run do not walk but run from this relationship", "NTA. Your gf is unhinged.", "NTA\n\nWTF?  I have 2 older half brothers.  We weren't really raised together past the time I was 3, but they're...my brothers.  I don't give a crap that we don't have the same mom.  I don't give a crap that we didn't grow up together.  They're my brothers.  Though it may be less common, this happens with step- relationships, too.  One of my brothers has 2 sons from his first marriage, and 2 stepdaughters from his second.  Though now divorced, those girls still call him \"Dad\" and refer to his boys as their brothers.  My nephews still call his ex, their stepmother \"Mom\" and refer to the girls as their sisters.  Their family is structured a bit differently now, but it's still very much a family.\n\nYou weren't lying, and you weren't keeping things from her.  You called your siblings your siblings.  Seriously, wtf?  This is such a weird thing for her to get this upset about.\n\nThat \"real family\" snit was really out of line, too.", "NTA.\n\nYour friend has a point. This suggests your gf only considers full blood siblings real family. It could mean she is dismissive towards people who are fostered or adopted or blended families that bonded well. It generally is a sign of bigotry and an unwillingness to be inclusive.", "Ruuuuuuuunnnnnnn away from the crazy. And don't look back!!!", "NTA. This is so strange to me?  My older sister is technically my half-sister, but I do not call her that.  She is my sister who has a different father, but we have the same mom and dad.  I have never seen her any different from my full brother, and she doesn't see us as anything different either.  \n\nHell, I forgot to tell my wife when we first started dating.  It only came up because I was bringing up a medical thing.  I said something along the lines of, \"yeah brother and I get regularly tested for the chance we develop dad's side health issues.\"  She was confused and asked why I didn't include my sister.  I responded with something along the lines of \"because it doesn't run on her father's side.\"  She became even more confused.  It then clicked that I had not told my wife that my sister has a biological father and the dad that raised her.  You know what my wife did?  Just went, oh ok, good to know, and continued on with her day.  I wasn't hiding it from her, but had she reacted like your gf, I would have probably dumped her.  My wife didn't though because she understands that families can look different and that is ok.\n\nSometimes, you forget to tell people things that you have known your whole life because it honestly doesn't affect how you treat people and live your life.  It rarely comes up, not because we ignore it, but it doesn't matter to us.  Family is what you make it and all the sappy stuff.", "NTA, that was a total overreaction of hers.  Why does it matter?", "NTA\nNot by A long shot...i grew up with one full blooded brother, a half brother and a half dozen step siblings between the tau sides... but can honestly say that they never really felt like anything but siblings.\nThe fact that she tried to call you on that is pretty disgusting, because if you felt the need to call them anything but siblings then you woukd have called them as such. You are free to describe your family how you want and if she has issues with it, then that's her problem.", "100% NTA. You friend call your gf toxic is correct. That is such a strange thing to consider a lie, and the fact that she accuses you of lying about other things and immediately asks to go through your phone makes me think she just has trust issues. This would be a dealbreaker for me tbh", "If someone suggested to me that my little brother wasn't my brother just because we had different dads, I would lose it. He's gone now and I think I would black out in rage if someone said that. \nSiblings are siblings are siblings. Some of them are from the same set of parents, some have one parent, some are your step family, some are adopted, hell some aren't related to you at all. You're nta. This is an insane reaction and I don't know if I'd be into this relationship anymore. The whole thing is weird.", "OP is NTA for how they think of their siblings.  Someone in this family is TA for having a party at 5:30 AM.  WTH??", "And he's been \"gaslighting\" her for a year about his family situation!"]}
