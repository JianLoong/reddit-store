Please don't let her opinion influence how you view your siblings.", "NTA\n\nWhy is your GF mad? Your half-siblings ARE your siblings.", "NTA. You called them your siblings because they are your siblings... You weren't actively trying to hide anything. This is a small misunderstanding and it sounds like she overreacted.", "NTA  sorry, this is nuts. They're your siblings and it's very weird that your gf is behaving this way. I certainly wouldn't stick around for this nonsense.", "NTA. Your friend is right, your gf is toxic (and maybe a little bit looney). I think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re close enough with your half siblings that you don\u2019t find the need to emphasise on the \u201chalf\u201d. Your gf literally went from zero to 100 over it.", "NTA\n\nI didn't quite finish reading, but regardless if they are full or half sibling's they are still your siblings. What did she want you to call them?", "NTA. They are your siblings and she\u2019s acting a fool. There is either something more personal to her outburst she needs to explain to you, or it\u2019s time to move on.", "NTA. I agree with your friend. Toxic drama queen who sounds extremely insecure if they think that you're hiding something because of this bizarro situation.", "NTA.\n\nSo because you didn\u2019t disclose your entire family\u2019s biological history she thinks you\u2019re cheating on her?\n\nWhat?", "NTA. Some people feel separated from half siblings and specify that separation. Others feel just as close with half siblings and dont feel the need for the distinction. You seem to be the latter and nta for that.", "NTA at all. I mean, you consider then as your siblings as well, \"half siblings\" it's just a label. She totally overreacted and, if I were you, I would start to look out for other red flags on her behavior. The problem isn't you, it's totally her.", "NTA. \n\nThe fact that you describe your half-siblings as your \u201csiblings\u201d and \u201csisters\u201d just speaks to the relationship you have with them. It\u2019s sweet, really. It\u2019s not like you were harboring some big secret from her. \n\nIt\u2019s like you telling her your favorite color is blue, when in fact, plot twist \u2014> it\u2019s aqua. And she flips her lid and asks to go through your phone lmao. \n\nShe\u2019s either super insecure, there something else triggering her, or she\u2019s not worth your time.", "NTA. A lot of people have different ideas on half siblings. Many consider a sibling a sibling and there are others who need to know who's the mom and who's the dad.", "NTA.\nMy husband has two sisters. One is a half sister. One is a full.\n\nIt was awhile before he told me. I didn\u2019t bat an eye because he has always viewed her as his sister. This seems to be a case of honest oversight on your part. \n\nWhy is she so stressed about this? It seems like she could be projecting.", "NTA they are your family you consider them your family there's nothing wrong with saying they're your siblings just because you have a different mother I have a similar relationship with my brother we may have different mothers but we are close brothers. However I do believe the girlfriend is an asshole for her reaction and behavior to this and your friend is right she is toxic.", "Nta, your gf is ridiculous. If you make no distinction between full or half siblings, good for you and totally none of your gf\u2019s business. I have no idea why your gf got mad at you, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Your friend is right, your gf is toxic as hell. There is something wrong with her.", "NTA this sounds like some weird form of projection", "NTA. That\u2019s a ridiculous reaction from her.", "NTA, it sounds like your gf has trust issues", "NTA. Your gf is the toxic A H here. I don't call my sisters my half-sisters to anyone - they are simply my little sisters. To say otherwise is just ridiculous and doesn't make you dishonest.", "NTA. Dump her now, especially with her \"real family\" parting shot. You and your half-siblings are definitely siblings even if you share just one parent. (Out of curiosity, I wonder why you never told your girlfriend about who is who in your family; even though you are NTA, you may want to ask yourself why you shared so little basic information about your family with your girlfriend.)", "NTA. I love that you don\u2019t think of them as \u201chalf\u201d siblings but simply your siblings. It sounds like you guys have a good relationship. Given all the step/half-sibling stories here on AITA, this is a nice change. \n\nThis is a really weird hill for your GF to die on. Also, she clearly doesn\u2019t think half-siblings are siblings, and I\u2019m curious how she reacts to them going forward. \n\nAt 19 she\u2019s young. I hope she matures and this is something that makes her cringe in the future. But in the meantime, you did nothing wrong. Please don\u2019t let her bully you into letting her scroll through your phone or put you down by calling you things like a liar and untrustworthy.\n\nEdit: clarity", "Only you get to decide who is family. \nI am a very white English woman and when I was 3, we took in an Iranian boy who was 15, and lived with us for around 7 years. To this day (I'm now in my 40s and he's in his 50s) he remains a treasured member of my family. If you look at us it's very noticeable we are not biologically related, but I call him my brother, and will have words with anyone who tries to say otherwise.\n\nNTA and your girlfriend appears to have presented you with a nice shiny new red flag.....", "Almost sounds like she just wanted to have a fight over something and picked this. I have half-sisters and guess what I call them? My sisters. It has never been an issue with literally anyone.", "NTA.\n\nYour GF does sound like she has some major issues, though.  I don't want to call her toxic on this limited information because in a situation like this there might be some family trauma involved--but unless she is willing to apologize and sit down and talk things out, I'd consider this a gigantic red flag,", "NTA, And i am guessing that she just wanted to go through your phone and shit but got mad when the excuse didn't work.", "NTA. Even at the best possible interpretation of her before or views, the most that can be said for her is that different people have different ideas about what the term \"sibling\" means. I introduce my brother to everyone and it often takes months before something gives me reason to remember to mention that he's not actually any blood relative to me at all -- we just chose each other. I hate to think what your girlfriend's view of *that* would be. \n\nYour definition is perfectly reasonable. It may not be the only reasonable definition of a sibling (though I think it's a kinder one than hers) but it's 100% okay. If your girlfriend's reaction to it is to decide you must be cheating on her because you did something \"untrustworthy\" by using one entirely reasonable word for that relationship instead of a different, also reasonable word for it, she has deeper problems than what you and your siblings call each other.", "NTA and that's a level of crazy you want to try your very best to avoid, my friend.", "All I know is, I want to come to grandmas house lol.", "\u201cI just dumped my insecure and controlling girlfriend, who probably shouldn\u2019t be dating, because she still has issues from her previous relationship. AITA?\u201c", "You're NTA but sounds like your gf is TA.  Siblings don't need to be labelled as half, step, etc if you don't want to. People who do that have reasons, usually some family tension where they don't feel the full sibling bond and that's okay too. You're lucky in your situation where they're just your siblings.\n\nI thought it was awesome when I was in my early 20's and it finally clicked for me that my eldest uncle had a different last name than my father because they had different fathers. So I finally asked and found out that my aunt and him were born first, my Oma lost her husband then remarried. There was zero way to tell  by way of interaction within the family. I was just slow at noticing the different name. It's sad that your gf wasn't just like cool, they are close and don't care for the half designation.", "NTA. half siblings are siblings, your girlfriend is being obtuse and completely overreacting, and I think your best friend is right. besides the fact that she's completely incorrect to say they aren't siblings, to go from \"he didn't tell me his siblings had a different mom\" to \"he must be cheating on me and I have a right to look through his phone\" is an enormous red flag.", "NTA. If she didn't' pick up on the family dynamics then either she wasn't listening or you didn't go over it very well, but thinking you were hiding it like a huge family secret is not normal. Consider this the crazy trash taking itself out. \n\nIt's also possible that she's projecting her own secrets/insecurities, or that she was looking for a way to mess up the relationship and this turned out to be a convenient point of contention.", "NTA, but... she's showing you who she is. Believe her. Get out now.", "NTA. Take your friend's advice and let her go.", "NTA. She's got a take on life and family that I wouldn't want to be around.", "NTA. She needs to be an ex. She is weird and judgmental.", "Father of 4 here of which only one is mine biologically. I raised ALL of them since the oldest was 7 (she\u2019s 35 now). None of my kids call their youngest sibling their half sibling. Your girlfriend is extremely immature. What you consider family IS your family. \nNTA", "Nta. I they are your siblings.", "NTA - she was looking for an exit and contrived one to make it \u201cyour\u201d fault. That\u2019s the only explanation. There\u2019s no logic in it any other way, but someone looking to leave a relationship without being the bad guy? Sounds about right.", "You are NTA and your girlfriend's view is weird", "NTA in any way shape or form.  I have 2 \"half-siblings\" but I never refer to them as such.  They're my sisters.  Your girlfriend sounds cuckoo for cocoa puffs and it's probably a good thing you found out about it now rather than later.  You're both young and she sounds like the jealous type.  You won't ever have any peace with her.", "NTA.  \n\nYour girlfriend has a very narrow and rigid definition of family and some remarkable trust issues.", "NTA. I have one full-sibling, the rest are technically half siblings. I never differentiate because it makes no difference to me - the closest I get is saying how many siblings I've got from my mom's side, and how many on my father's side since they've both had kids with people other than each other.\n\nIf I introduced any of my \"half siblings\", I wouldn't bother differentiating at all. A brother is a brother, a sister is a sister.\n\nA very odd response from your girlfriend, and I agree that her behavior is unhealthy. Freaking out, storming out and then giving you silent treatment are not constructive ways to handle conflict in a relationship.", "NTA. We all define family for ourselves. Your girlfriend sounds a little unhinged. I would consider this a significant red flag and though I\u2019m hesitant to jump to the usual AITA answer of dump her, I would really recommend that you reconsider your relationship as I can\u2019t imagine being with someone like her.
