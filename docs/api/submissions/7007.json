It would have been best to discuss it with him after.", "YTA cuz this must have been some scarf.", "NAH. The husband obviously accepted the gift graciously, because OP didn\u2019t realize he didn\u2019t like it. He wore it to the birthday celebration with his family, not because he loved it, but to show appreciation to his wife. OP overheard a private conversation in which his mother asked about the scarf; the husband did not initiate any snark. He merely implied that although he would embarrass himself for the sake of his wife\u2019s esteem, he would not put his child in that position. People should accept gifts with kindness and gratitude, but they are not required to like them. I loved my grandmother dearly and she spent a lot of time sewing and quilting for her family and was very proud of her creations, but they were atrocious. \nI understand OP\u2019s hurt feelings, but ruining her husband\u2019s birthday celebration by walking out to make it all about herself seems over the top. \nI am astonished, but shouldn\u2019t be surprised, by the number of Redditors jumping on the \u201cburn it to the ground\u201d response just because a spouse didn\u2019t love an unrequested gift and expressed that sentiment privately.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I love sewing, the only thing I inherited from my mother was her sewing machine. I'm pregnant and sewing helps sooth my axiety. So I decided to make my husband a scarf as a gift for his birthday.\n\n\nWe had the celebration at his parents house. I'd already given him his gift and he was wearing it. I was in the kitchen but overheard him and his mom talk about the scarf. His mom asked who gave him this and he told her that I made it for him. A moment of silence - then he said \"don't worry, I won't let her sew anything for our son, we don't want him to get bullied for it at school\". His mom then said \"we sure don't\". I was stunned and quite hurt. I took my coat and bag and made my way out. He and his mom saw me and he tried to talk to me to get back but I ended uo going home.\n\n\nHe tried to argue later saying I made a scene at his birthday and disrespected his parents by walking out. When I told him about what he said, he said I was still in the wrong for walking out instead of waiting to address the issue later. His mom and dad called to give me some stern talk about the move I pulled. My husband told me to get my hormons in check and stop acting so sensitive.\n\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The knitted type is obvious.\n\nFor the sewed type I have, its a patterned fabric backed with a single color fabric sewed to it. With mine, the patterned fabric is a heavier one (comparatively). Probably not wool, but something thats clearly meant for keeping warm. The single color fabric is a lighter weight smooth one. Not silk or satin, but something that gives that sort of feel.\n\nWith the combination of fabrics, pattern and color, its quite dressy imo. Where my knit one is a utilitarian, \"its cold outside\" garment.

I've found men to be generally forthright and women to be far more likely to be disingenuous about things. And I'm a woman.
