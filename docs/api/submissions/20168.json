Her mother passed away when she was 11. It was a tragedy for our family and I miss her everyday. I tried to  give my best to my daughter as a sole parent, I am fortunate to be very well put off financially.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nTina is brilliant, and has so many qualities, I just feel that sometimes, she's a bit impressionable. After high school she went to a business school in another city so she had to move out. Luckily, I own a very nice apartment there so she could live in it for free, I also bought her a car, payed the tuitions fees, and gave her a monthly allowance. I know how hard college can be, so I wanted to relieve her of any financial stress so she could focus on the academics. \n\n\r  \n\r  \nI mentionned to her that I'll give her the apartment once her studies are finsihed. I also promised her a 1 month fully paid trip to the country of her choice once she graduates, as I gifted to my nephew after his graduation few years ago. \r  \n\r  \nFirst years went well, she got good grades and was happy. Few months ago, she visited me with her friend Kayla (they met at the business school), I don't like to judge but I told Tina to be careful because she looks trouble, she wasn't happy and said to mind my own business. Fine. \n\n\r  \n\r  \nFew days ago, Tina told me that she decided to ditch college, because \u00ab\u00a0too hard\u00a0\u00bb and \u00ab\u00a0boring\u00a0\u00bb, she told me that she created an OnlyFans with the help of Kayla, and got a job as a dancer in a nightclub. \n\n\r  \n\r  \nObviously I was upset, I told her that Kayla was a bad influence, she couldn't ditch her studies like that, it is not reasonnable. She replied that with her OF and her job, she gets nice income and  more free time than some corporate job, I said that it is the kind of decision she will regret later, she told me that I have to respect her decision. I did some research on how OF works and the work conditions of nightclub dancers, and I think that Tina would be way better with the college route. \n\n\r  \n\r  \nI try to convince her to put this project on hold and at least finish her studies, then she can do whatever she wants. She doesn't want to. So yesterday I told her that I can't support that choice and  don't want to sponsor her new lifestyle, if she wants to go down that route, then I will stop paying her car insurance and her allowance. Also, I will not gift her the apartment or the trip to Japan. She got very angry and said that I was betraying my promise, I answered that it was supposed to be graduation gifts. If she quits school then, she shouldn't get rewarded. She called me a petty asshole, said that my wife would be ashamed of me and she left.\r  \n\r  \nSo now I'm starting to doubt myself. I am angry with Tina's choice and feel that I sploit her too mucb, one the other hand, I feel bad about all that situation..\r  \n\r  \nSo AITA\u00a0?", "created_utc": 1687285260, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14eiqlv/aita_for_dropping_my_financial_support_to_my/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe she'll do really well with it and make great money, maybe she won't, but it sounds like she's determined to figure that out on her own. But those things you were doing for her were to help her get through college and focus on that, so why would you continue doing those things when she's working and doing her own thing?

But do you still want her in your life? If you do, I recommend that you set aside any moral judgements\u2014ppl on OF CAN make a TON of money in the short term, but it is dangerous for various reasons. If you love her and want her in your life, I recommend that you introduce her to a trustworthy financial advisor who can help her invest the money she makes so when she doesn\u2019t want to do this any more or when she gets too old, she will at least have a nest egg\u2014for example, she could save money and buy an apt complex and that way in the future if she wants to retire from OF, she can manage this complex and her past work experience won\u2019t harm her future ability to sustain herself.

You do not have to approve of your daughter doing sex work. Nobody respects the east way out.", "NTA. You sound like a good dad. You should even start making her pay rent if she makes that much money !", ">She replied that with her OF and her job, she gets nice income and more free time than some corporate job, I said that it is the kind of decision she will regret later, she told me that I have to respect her decision. \n\nSo, she's fine with earning via showing off her body online and dancing in nightclubs in front of leering men, and she's confident it will pay well enough for her life.\n\nIf that's the case, why's she mad that you are cutting her off financially? The condition for the financial support was that she goes to college and makes something of herself. What she said definitely doesn't need your support. \n\n>She replied that with her OF and her job, she gets nice income and more free time than some corporate job, I said that it is the kind of decision she will regret later, she told me that I have to respect her decision. \n\nIf anything, her late mother would be as disappointed as you are with her. If she's on board with her daughter's decision, great, they should be the ones who should be ashamed.\n\nNTA. You bent over backwards to give her a life and not feel her mother's absence and look what you're getting in return. At least you had the self-respect to stand up to her (yes, because saying no to your child takes more guts than you think).", "NTA.\n\nI believe you should be given a wide berth of how you raised your daughter. A single dad who is well off trying provide and set his daughter up properly in her early adulthood is admirable. But\u2026\n\nShe ended the contract you had with her by leaving school. I think the only thing I may have done differently as a parent (and I am one) would perhaps I might have been a little bit less judgmental about her friend and choices.

Now she\u2019s decided she knows better than you.", "NTA. You provided support with reasonable stipulations.

She wants to work instead? Fine, she can use that income instead.\n\nNow if she were doing *both* that'd be different.", "And another young woman falls victim to the OF exploitation movement. NTA. Just be ready to help her pick up the pieces of her life once she realizes what she has done.", "NTA-  Your daughter has decided to enter the sex trade.\n\nYou cannot support that decision and I would suggest cutting her off completely.  \n\nShe had a horrible childhood with the loss of her mother. you did the absolute best you could to give her ever opportunity to be successful. \n\nI just had a friend go through this exact same thing with her daughter.   Started with TikTok and then OF. \n\nI\u2019m sorry.", "NTA\n\nYou're her father, not her friend. If she wants to make terrible life decisions you don't have to support that, just love her anyways. Besides, if she's making \"so much more\" taking the route of the future lonely 40+ year old that can't find a decent man, then she shouldn't need your money anyways. This is not a exactly a new fad, either. A lot of women meet a lot of shitty influences in college, end up ruining their lives because the claws of those harpies do not let go, and many never manage to get away from it. By showing her consequences now, you're at least giving her a chance at realizing she's been lied to while she's still young enough to bounce back from it relatively unscathed.", "She is basicly an adult baby and you enabled her.", "She is spoiled and spoiled people are often bored. And bored people tend to look for high dopamine activities. Everything will keep boring her and she will go to very dangerous things. \n\nOP: I hope you read my comment, this is very important: she will also get a dopamine kick from fighting with you, shocking you etc. Every negative reaction is good for her. So at some point you have to learn to not respond in a certain way and be almost numb. So she will not go and do dangerous things with dangerous people to get this \"high\" out of the idea that it angers you. She needs cognitive therapy to change the patterns in her (bored) brain.", "NTA. I think despite what many people will say, no matter how much a person respects sex work, very, very few people would be happy with their son or daughter going into sex work, for many, many reasons.\n\nFact is that your daughter is 22, she can make her own choices and so can you. If she decided to go down this path for easier money, then thats fine, but in that case she doesnt need all the help from you anymore.\n\nRegardless of what is said, you are both free to make your own choices. And no i dont think you are the A for changing your mind on some things", "Sorry to say it, but your daughter\u2019s mother would be ashamed of her.

It is an industry that is not kind to people as they age and therefore has a very short lifespan during which it is a viable option to support yourself. Only a few people make enough money not only to support themselves in the moment, but also to save enough money for when their youth and beauty no longer earn them enough to get by. It's incredibly arrogant to assume that she will be one of the special ones and will never need a college degree to fall back on.\n\n\nAt the end of the day you can't stop her making her own choices, but you can use the small influence you have to help her make her bad choices in the smartest way. I.e. finish the degree first so you have that to fall back on and then go and make whatever poor choices you want.

If it\u2019s the latter, which is kind of the vibe I\u2019m getting here, I get why she would be hurt and angry.

She doesn\u2019t realise how good she has it if I\u2019m honest. My father was extremely unsupportive of my pursuit towards getting a law degree. I quite literally had to leave home at 16 on my own with no money or family  just so I could be free from his control and get my education. He was so against it that he actually took me out of secondary school so I had to complete my secondary education later than everyone else. Getting the opportunity to do this degree was something I fought for, left home for and went into debt for. I honestly wish that my father had been supportive like you. I haven\u2019t spoken to my father since the day I left, he wants nothing to do with me and apparently hates me.

Dig down and try to be supportive (not a helicopter parent, she\u2019s a grown adult who\u2019s chosen her path) just let her know she\u2019s loved, maybe give this thing a rethink when you cool down. \n\nBest of luck buddy\n-Merk", "NTA. I was so ready to come for this thinking you were just against that line of work, but absolutely not. Hard no. You were helping her because she was a student, and you were trying to give her a step up in life with a solid education, and then rewards for working on said education. If she wants to throw all that down the drain, then you\u2019re fully within your right to pull your financial help. What she\u2019s pulling wasn\u2019t the deal, and you don\u2019t get rewarded for not finishing. \n\nAlso, OF and dancing are great for lots of people, but what happens as she gets older and looks fade? What is her fallback plan?", "Well, now she has even more reasons to earn money on onlyfans...", "If you can share the OF link, i can contribute instead of you \u270c\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89", "NTA. I would talk to her and ask her to request a leave of absence from her college instead of quitting altogether. Also, ask if she can show you her recent grades to see if she is discouraged because of poor grades. Offer her financial support if she decides to go back to college after she tries these new endeavors. If she can support herself with the new jobs, then just accept it and try to meet up frequently to maintain a good relationship.", "NTA.  In her words what does she need college for?  SHe found her true calling dancing in a strip club and having an only fans.\n\nYour reward, namely the vacation and the apartment was upon graduation of college.  She chose to stop going college and therefor give up the reward.  I dont think you did anything wrong  NTA", "NTA,  \nThere's a saying, \"Fuck around and find out\". Tina is fucking around with all that you have given to her. And now, she's starting to find out there's consequences for her actions. Stick to your guns here.", "NTA For Aparently No Longer Needing To be a Parent Go Ahead and do you Op", ">I don't like to judge\n\nAvailable evidence suggests otherwise.  YTA.", "NTA. you seem like a reasonable father. sucks that experiencing the world, alone, as a young adult sometimes leads to meeting the wrong people and doing the wrong things. that's all that is, hope she gets back on the right path", "NTA as she is 22 and an adult and SHOULD be able to support herself but....\n\nYTA for clearly not equipping her with the skills to be able to navigate life on her own at the age of 22 because it seems like she has not had to graft.\n\nI've seen adults, who have been through similar, crumble because they don't really know enough or have the self belief in themselves to strive for independence. \n\nMaybe gently ease into it.  Have a conversation with her acknowledging that there have been failings on your part, but that it's not to late to work out a plan together for her to gain true independence on a realistic timescale...and the money you would have otherwise spent during the transition can be put aside for a house or retirement fund for her.  \n\nBasically, if you are going to pull the rug from her feet, try do it in a way where she doesn't fall flat on her face!", "NTA. You were paying bills/paying for trips/etc. because you wanted to help her out in COLLEGE. Also, she\u2019s an adult, so she should be grateful that you offered to help her out for so long.", "NTA. It sounds like it was all contingent on school, and you would have had the same reaction if she dropped out to be a plumber or something. Not even sure the OF/nightclub stuff is a necessary detail.", "NTA. Your money, your rules.", "Sounds like youre an asshole for her not living in your shining image. Dont burn her out on something she no longer wants to do. She has a mind of her own and is not a puppet of her friend. She's tired of living up to your expectations and has found balance with home and work life.\n\nI agree you should quit trying to bribe her to be who you want her to be. Youre not the asshole for dropping support. You are an asshole for not supporting her in her adult decisions.", "My guess is she\u2019s so used to OP just paying for her entire life, she thought she could get away with it. He didn\u2019t just offer to help pay a portion of these expenses; he paid for *everything,* plus a month long vacation to boot. How is she going to learn to budget and be independent if someone else is paying for her whole life?", "This is really good advice. Make it clear to her that you don't support her current choices because you don't think they will lead her to long term stability, but that you still love her and will always be there for her if her choices don't work out.", "It doesn't look like he's pushing her away. He's being firm in his decision which she's too stupid to understand. He's always gonna be there for her when she loses her path.", "Great advice", "such thing are atmost good for a few years, but nobody stays young forever and hypes change, at some point you need a \"normal\" job and for that unfortanatly you need a degree most times", "Exactly this. I thought by the title that OP was just going to be hating on the lifestyle, but nope. He\u2019s just upset that she\u2019s dropping out of school and throwing that all away which is 100 percent reasonable! If she wants to do those things, she could absolutely do it while still in school, and just have some extra spending money, or even money for investing in her future.", "Can't believe it took me this long to find someone who felt this way. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as soon as I read about the \"bad influence friend Kayla\" who corrupted his poor, brilliant, innocent daughter into a life of sex-work.", "Yes this sounds completely made up.", "Your suggestion sucks. Imagine cutting off a child because she might make a bad choice for HERSELF. \nI might debate cutting off my loves ones if they commit mass murder but an only fans account -while not what I would want for myself- should not ruin parental love", "What does not being able to find a man have to do with this?", "This is such a weirdo comment", "What is this incel sh*t?", "Not anymore. NTA", "There's just so many of them so we need to be able to avoid the right one! \n\nNTA OP.  You are absolutely correct that college is the right choice and you are absolutely within your right to stop funding an adult whose decisions you disagree with.", "Having an onlyfans and working as a dancer at a night club is not sustainable, especially when you dont even have a college degree", "Yeah, it sounds like she tried to do the math on how much she'd be making but didn't add in the assets she has with dad paying for everything.", "Thats a good point. He raised her to be spoiled can't blame her too much either.", "In all likelihood it won't work out, and she will soon realise how hard it is to sustain her lifestyle without the many contributions of OP. So she'll probably come back for help. \nOP: would you be happy to resume your contributions should she resume her studies? Should she resume studies but in a different field? Should she start a business that is unrelated to sex work? Under what conditions would you be able to help her again, and how much? It doesn't have to be all or nothing. Just something to think about", "In all likelihood it won't work out, and she will soon realise how hard it is to sustain her lifestyle without the many contributions of OP.

I just know from experience that it really helps to know that when you realize you've made a mistake you can come back to a person and they will accept and help you...no questions asked.\n\nI was in an abusive relationship and obviously my parents didn't approve but I'm really grateful that they always made a point of telling me they're there for me. When i finally managed to escape the relationship they helped me a lot.", "The entire thing is fiction. I won\u2019t try to speculate on OP\u2019s actual life, but it must not be too great if his fantasy of wealth has gone so far that it includes imaginary strife at this point.", "Uhm seeing your daughter who u support and pay for a lifestyle and future for decide to sell her body to men when her school car and house is paid for and money isnt an issue for is completely insane, i get if she needed the money and needed a house or car or wanted to go to school and needed big money fast, but im sorry a girl who comes from a supportive father like that has one job and thats to respect herself and her father, why do girls think its okay to be a fucking prostitute adult or not its fucking vile and shows shes a spoiled lazy brat who want to get rich fast by being a pig for money, she wont even make the money her dad has offered to pay and been paying, shes honestly retarted", "Because now that she's ruined, no nice guy will ever want her and if she can't bag a man who judges women by their sexual histories, what hope does she have of ever having a happy or fulfilling life? /s", "Yeah, who would want to have a fulfilling relationship?", "Showcasing one of the natural conclusions from the continuance of making bad choices due to believing something they should know better than to give more than a moment of consideration. It was also far more polite than calling her a whore or referencing her as a sex trader. More to the meat of the point, that sentence is referring to the fact that she wouldn't be able to sell herself in that way if she wasn't already being financially supported by her father, and that in the future she would have a very hard time finding a husband to continue to support her due to her chosen profession. Otherwise, having his allowance and free room taken away would not be affecting her in the slightest.", "And that is such a low effort reply.", "Obviously something more than you're capable of processing", "This is about financial support and the contingency of finishing school. What does this have to do with that?", "Again, what does that have to do with finding a man? It's about financial support contingent on finishing school and her father not wanting to support her lifestyle which he is entitled to not. That's it.", "And you need therapy", "Your bullshit ass comment deserves that amount of effort", "No, I just recognize that women are worth more than what they can offer a man (assuming she even wants one).", "I've already explained that sex work (which is what she started doing) was being referred to by choosing a lifestyle that ends with her being alone and unsupported. If you don't understand or like that, that's fine. I'm not sure what answer you're fishing for, though.", "Possibly. Once you break out of your teens I'm sure you'll have a different outlook on life. Take care of yourself until then :)", "Congratulations, you found a way to lower the bar even further. I'm sure your parents are even less proud of you now than they were five minutes ago.", "Sounds more like you're projecting by selecting one piece of one sentence that is only a small part of the main point. Not sure where your bone is, but it's not with me so you should go picking for it elsewhere.", "Good explanation. I also think there should be emphasis on the word \u201cdecent\u201d in that sentence from your first comment. OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s poor decisions probably wont have have impact on her \u201cfinding a man\u201d but they will very likely have a huge influence on her making a life with a decent man, should she one day want that for herself.", "'inserts self into thread' \n\"why are you responding to me?!\" \n\ud83d\ude44", "To be fair, it was obvious that it didn't matter what I replied with, she was going to be upset at the audacity of assuming the OP's daughter would one day want someone to grow old with (as though that's not what the overwhelmingly large majority of people want). Going even further into it by notating that I specified \"decent\", how this conclusion is being seen in real time by a myriad of women that are as young as 25, or the blatant pseudo-politics that led to this way of thinking (with blatant warning from the father to stay away from its source) would all just be pissing in the wind as far as most of the responders are concerned.", "That's.... not only incorrect, it's nonsensical. Look, if you don't understand something just say so and I'll explain."]}
