Sounds like she's late a lot. Waiting for her only gives her permission to keep doing it. Her apologies mean nothing because she doesn't change her behavior. Of course she's going to blame you. She'll always have any excuse. Soon, she'll claim she has \"time blindness\". \n\nPeople like her have no consideration for others. You were already there. Why not wait forever until she graces you with her presence?\n\nDo not apologize. Tell her you're done waiting. If she's 10 minutes late, you will leave. If you come to pick her up and she's not ready, you will leave without her. Your friendship might not last, but she's not being a friend, is she?", "NTA. She couldn't look around for you?  And that late?\n\nYou're better off without her.", "NTA. imagine how long she would have kept you waiting if you had booked at 11:30! she should not have planned two activities so close together in one day. this is her fault.", "NTA. She should have called or texted the moment she knew she was going to be late instead of you having to keep trying. She\u2019s not much of a friend.", "NTA. \n\nLet her apologize and offer to buy you lunch.", "NTA.  Her time is more valuable to her. And likely she is always running late no matter what or who all are waiting. I probably would have made it home and text her I was driving when she called and phone was on mute while driving. Seems like iPhone has or had a setting that when driving it won\u2019t bother you. So maybe all cell phones do. Snarky might be apologizing for her wasting her time driving there after you had let her know you were leaving as it was embarrassing sitting there not eating after x minutes.", "NTA - You booked for 30 minutes later than originally planned and she just flaked on you.  Always going to be there in just a few more minutes. She was lying to you, she knew she wouldn't be there in 15 minutes and she didn't care if you just sat there waiting for her. She isn't your friend.", "NTA.  She was very late and did not keep you informed. The restaurant lost money because the reservation was cancelled, it was a \u201cno show\u201d as far as they were concerned.  Four days with no call to check if you are mad?  She has either blown you off or she is waiting long enough for you to get over being mad and will contact you when she thinks it is safe and she can sweep it under the rug or deflect the blame.  Either way, she is not really a considerate friend to you.  You have three choices, forgive her, blow her off or do it to her and then see what happens.", "NTA\n\nLife is too short to waste on unreliable people.", "15 - maybe 20 - minutes grace period is all I give  then I either order for myself or leave. If I leave the table without ordering I leave a small tip for the inconvenience. I\u2019ll give you 2 chances and the 3rd time will be the last time I invite you to anything.  NTA she needed to be respectful of your time.", "NTA. She didn't let you know she would be late until you messaged her first, didn't keep you updated, arrived nearly an hour late and apparently didn't even bother reading the message you send to let her know you were leaving. It's very coincidental that she arrived only 5 minutes after you left as well. I'm guessing she hasn't messaged you yet because she is waiting long enough that she thinks you won't confront her about the situation when she does or she has already decided you are the one at fault and is waiting for you to call her with an apology, like a lot of people who are in the wrong like to do.", "NTA     She's beyond rude and you waited far longer than necessary.  Especially in an embarrassing situation like that.   I've walked out sooner than that.", "NTA people like this eat up so much of your time. However much fun they are to be around you spend three or four times as long being messed around and having  your time wasted.\n\nThey can usually manage to be on time for work, or something they really care about though.", "NTA. \nShe is not your friend.", "NTA- I would have left at 12:15.", "NTA \nPeople like this are obnoxious assholes. She basically told you her time is more valuable than yours, and you should just suck it up when she is this rude.  Dump her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had a \"friend\" like that, we'd organized a girls night out dinner with maybe 5 or 6 other people (yes it was both of us organizing it). I got there a bit early and everyone else showed up on time. I called her about 20 minutes after we were supposed to start and when she answered the phone it sounded like I had just woken her up. She lived at least 30 minutes away so we ordered without her and ate. When she did finally show up over an hour late she complained we had all finished. That was the first big red flag - after the third big red flag we were no longer friends. \n\nPeople with so little respect for your time probably don't have a lot of respect in general.", "exactly. my friends and I text each other when we're on our way and let the other know immediately if any timing has been impacted. \n\nOPs friend was straight up disrespectful and clearly has no regard for anyone else's time.", "NTA.

When I make arrangements I accommodate her as far as possible, I allow wide bands of flexibility in terms of arrival time. But she gets stressed about not making it and is genuinely apologetic, your friend on the other hand doesn't prioritise you and doesn't care if they're lately screw them", "NTA but a bit daft. Late people are late people. You can't change them. Give them the wrong time (my sister knows I give her an earlier deadline) or plan around them and keep it flexible (people with kids usually). Next time make the starting location somewhere you don't mind waiting. Your house. A cocktail bar. The library. Somewhere in a shopping mall.", "Same.  This same thing happened to me earlier this year. Guy was gonna be in my country and my city for just one day, so I adjusted my plans to be able to meet for a drink. Got to bar, ordered a drink. 15 minutes later *I* call *him*. He says he's running late, any minute now, order me a drink. OK, it happens. After 30 minutes, still no sight nor sound of him. I consumed the second drink, paid, tipped, sent a \"I don't have time for this shit\" text, and went home.  Turns out he had no good reason to be late.\n\nIn fairness I think he did feel bad and he did apologise, but fucksake, it wasn't convenient to meet him in the first place\n\nNTA", "NTA , she even smiled by saying she'll be here in 15 min and still wasn't there. People should have a little more respect", "NTA if she couldn't even bother to walk through the restaurant to look for you then she isn't a friend worth worrying over.", "Why did she want you to book for 11.30 when she had a previous event?  12pm would have surely been better, but then she couldn't even be there on time because of said event.  Sounds like she's hopeless at time management and planning.  OP NTA.", "NTA.\n\nAt 12:45 with no updates I\u2019d be assuming that she stood me up. She didn\u2019t bother to tell you that she was on her way, so you had no way of knowing that she was actually going to show. Clearly her fundraising thing was where she actually wanted to be. \n\n\nI think this friendship is over. She has offered no apologies and you\u2019re still too angry, four days later, to reach out. And it sounds like this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s left you hanging. If you\u2019re not the sort of person who has a high tolerance for chronic lateness, she is not the friend for you.", "NTA.\n\nCan't stand people who don't respect and value other people's time. \n\nAlso, restaurants can only hold a table for so long. That's them losing money.", "NTA", "NTA. She was 45 minutes late without any notice. You had a right to walk out. If I were you and afraid she'll try to pin it on me, keep your conversation with her. If anyone hears how you left before she arrived, let them know you left 45 minutes after the agreed meeting time. Everyone gets that.", "NTA. She was not there. She didn't care. You have better things to do.", "I'm fuming on your behalf.

You sent it to voicemail on purpose then try to act like it magically came in.  And now you're acting like she is the only one who can reach out (she did with the call) and expect her to come begging you to forgive her.  Neither of you are worth having a friendship with.", "This 100% couldn\u2019t have said it better.", "Not sure if your quotes mean you're being flippant about time blindness or if you're saying she would be lying, but it is absolutely real! I have ADHD and time blindness is a huge part of it-- however I would NEVER be 45 min late to something and if I was running late I'd be sweating, panicking, apologizing profusely. This situation isn't showing time blindness she knows she is late and is saying she needs more time and is mostly showing selfishness, especially as she was already late and could tell from her text time stamps. Time blindness just doesn't apply here", "Lots of this is well said. Just want to say time blindness is a real thing that genuinely causes real problems.", "I do mind waiting and not daft, I have brought the late subject up with her before and it stopped for a while. However it was never 45 mins in a public eating area.", "She was 50 mins late. I left at the 45-minute mark. In hindsight, I should not have messaged her checking her timing. I should have waited 15 and with no communication walked out.\nStill have not heard anything from her, and with every day and every comment, I am getting closer to ending the \"friendship\"", "Yeah and then you send messages saying \"Hey I'm coming there, but will not make it on time I'll arrive around xx\" among the apologies", "I understand you and your inclination to end the friendship.\nMy friend was 50 minutes late to our lunch for my birthday and I left after 35 minutes. I got a call after 50 minutes saying: \"I am really sorry, but it wasn't my fault.\" She went for a facial before and decided to get another service on top without checking if she had time for it or letting the beautician know she had to be out by a certain time. Then tried to sell it to me as trying to look pretty for our meal but forgot she told me the day before that she had a date that evening. We are in contact, but not close anymore. Now I am getting messages, complaining about her feeling isolated and lonely with no really close friends. For some reason, I am not surprised."]}
