Sounds like she's late a lot. Waiting for her only gives her permission to keep doing it. Her apologies mean nothing because she doesn't change her behavior. Of course she's going to blame you. She'll always have any excuse. Soon, she'll claim she has \"time blindness\". \n\nPeople like her have no consideration for others. You were already there. Why not wait forever until she graces you with her presence?\n\nDo not apologize. Tell her you're done waiting. If she's 10 minutes late, you will leave. If you come to pick her up and she's not ready, you will leave without her. Your friendship might not last, but she's not being a friend, is she?", "NTA. She couldn't look around for you?  And that late?\n\nYou're better off without her.", "NTA. imagine how long she would have kept you waiting if you had booked at 11:30! she should not have planned two activities so close together in one day. this is her fault.", "NTA. She should have called or texted the moment she knew she was going to be late instead of you having to keep trying. She\u2019s not much of a friend.", "NTA. \n\nLet her apologize and offer to buy you lunch.", "NTA.  Her time is more valuable to her. And likely she is always running late no matter what or who all are waiting. I probably would have made it home and text her I was driving when she called and phone was on mute while driving. Seems like iPhone has or had a setting that when driving it won\u2019t bother you. So maybe all cell phones do. Snarky might be apologizing for her wasting her time driving there after you had let her know you were leaving as it was embarrassing sitting there not eating after x minutes.", "NTA - You booked for 30 minutes later than originally planned and she just flaked on you.  Always going to be there in just a few more minutes. She was lying to you, she knew she wouldn't be there in 15 minutes and she didn't care if you just sat there waiting for her. She isn't your friend.", "NTA.  She was very late and did not keep you informed. The restaurant lost money because the reservation was cancelled, it was a \u201cno show\u201d as far as they were concerned.  Four days with no call to check if you are mad?  She has either blown you off or she is waiting long enough for you to get over being mad and will contact you when she thinks it is safe and she can sweep it under the rug or deflect the blame.  Either way, she is not really a considerate friend to you.  You have three choices, forgive her, blow her off or do it to her and then see what happens.", "NTA\n\nLife is too short to waste on unreliable people.", "15 - maybe 20 - minutes grace period is all I give  then I either order for myself or leave. If I leave the table without ordering I leave a small tip for the inconvenience. I\u2019ll give you 2 chances and the 3rd time will be the last time I invite you to anything.  NTA she needed to be respectful of your time.", "NTA. She didn't let you know she would be late until you messaged her first, didn't keep you updated, arrived nearly an hour late and apparently didn't even bother reading the message you send to let her know you were leaving. It's very coincidental that she arrived only 5 minutes after you left as well. I'm guessing she hasn't messaged you yet because she is waiting long enough that she thinks you won't confront her about the situation when she does or she has already decided you are the one at fault and is waiting for you to call her with an apology, like a lot of people who are in the wrong like to do.", "NTA     She's beyond rude and you waited far longer than necessary.  Especially in an embarrassing situation like that.   I've walked out sooner than that.", "NTA people like this eat up so much of your time. However much fun they are to be around you spend three or four times as long being messed around and having  your time wasted.\n\nThey can usually manage to be on time for work, or something they really care about though.", "NTA. \nShe is not your friend.", "NTA- I would have left at 12:15.", "NTA \nPeople like this are obnoxious assholes. She basically told you her time is more valuable than yours, and you should just suck it up when she is this rude.  Dump her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had a \"friend\" like that, we'd organized a girls night out dinner with maybe 5 or 6 other people (yes it was both of us organizing it). I got there a bit early and everyone else showed up on time. I called her about 20 minutes after we were supposed to start and when she answered the phone it sounded like I had just woken her up. She lived at least 30 minutes away so we ordered without her and ate. When she did finally show up over an hour late she complained we had all finished. That was the first big red flag - after the third big red flag we were no longer friends. \n\nPeople with so little respect for your time probably don't have a lot of respect in general.", "exactly. my friends and I text each other when we're on our way and let the other know immediately if any timing has been impacted. \n\nOPs friend was straight up disrespectful and clearly has no regard for anyone else's time."]}
