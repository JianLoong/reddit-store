Usually this is more of the ask for going out to dinner. Considering you guys are estranged and everything goes through his girlfriend, I don\u2019t know if your son is the type to just accommodate your wants. You may be better trying to ask his girlfriend if she could convince him to at least wear appropriate attire to dinner since his grandmother will be there. That you\u2019re not expecting business casual, but at the least no inappropriate graphic clothing, and at that point suggesting maybe jeans and a nice shirt. It\u2019s more likely the girlfriend will be able to convince him without as much of a fight than you. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t view it like setting a dress code, but more so politely asking (again, probably the girlfriend rather than him).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Looks like you messed up somewhere with this young man who refuses to grow up.", " ETA Clearly this situation has bigger issues than the dress code at a dinner date. If you know he\u2019s going to try and offend grandma at this point in his life then having him Ti the dinner is not useful. \n\nIt sounds like a lot has happened to drive a wedge between you. Work on fixing that first , then you won\u2019t need to \u2018set dress codes\u2019 for an adult. Figure out what is really driving your son to act that way. Is it a rebellion faze, major change social group, you\u2019ve do some things to drive home away, etc.", "NTA. Especially seeing grandmother. Your kid needs direction. Your jobless slob of a kid. Clean clothes isn\u2019t too big an ask.", "Info What led to him being estranged from you?", "NTA. It\u2019s a basic sign of respect to dress semi decently in public. I can\u2019t believe how much I sound like my grandma but seriously what is wrong with kids these days?! It\u2019s disrespectful to show up in sweats and slides to dinner. I can\u2019t believe the comments saying you shouldn\u2019t give a grown man a dress code. An actual grownup doesn\u2019t need one because as part of growing up they\u2019ve learned how to act and behave in different situations.", "Your son is already estranged from you and you think telling him how to dress is going to make things better?  If he's that much of an embarrassment to you, don't invite him.  I'm guessing this is the root of why you're estranged.  YWBTA", "NTA, but only because it\u2019s your place, your rules. It sounds like you\u2019re embarrassed by him and that raises so many other issues, but that\u2019s all outside of your question here.", "Not going to judge ...\n1. Your house your rules ... but\n2. Is this really a hill you want to die on?", "YWBTA clearly your kid has some mental health shit going on and telling him to dress nice for grandma is not going to help anything. His clothes are  not the issue here.", "YTA. Kids don't go NC over a dress code and meddling in a relationship. There's a reason he doesn't want to talk to you, and giving him a dress code to a dinner he doesn't want to go to is only giving him one more reason not to go. If he wants to see his grandmother he can do it on his own, unless you decide to ruin that for him also.", "YTA. Surely seeing your son, and him seeing his grandmother, is more important than what he\u2019s wearing?", "YTA. It's interesting that you are NC with your son, but your only problem is his clothing choice. Why even bother with that if you can't be bothered to work on your broken relationship. So you expect him to focus on your clothing request and completely ignore that his parents only care about what he wears and not what is going on inside him? Just rent a son for the occasion, dress him like you want and he can just sit there as a placeholder because you obviously don't care about the actual person, you just want the presentation.", "Info:  What's more important, spending time with your son regardless of clothing, or only seeing him when he achieves a certain standard for you? \n\nIf its the latter than YTA", "YWBTA, either don't invite him at all or do and accept him just as he is. Only invite him if you can communicate to him that it would mean a lot to you to see him. Leave it up to him to decide if he shows up.", "YTA. He's estranged. Not working. Living off hid gf. Maybe focus more on what he is going through and how to support him to be more independent. Is he depressed? Is he in school studying something that will let him support himself.\n\nWhat he wears to eat dinner with grandma seems to be the least of the issues for your family.", "Yes YTA for giving an adult man a dress code in your home. I can see why he\u2019s gone NC with you.", "YTA - if you don\u2019t think he would come without the code, why would he with it. A family member also tried implementing dress codes at family events in my family and it hasn\u2019t gone well.", "[removed]", "I think it's fair to ask no graphics or bad language. I think going by the dress code required by a high school is fair. I think anything more is pushing it.", "Ummm. Adults can dress themselves. Tbh it seems like there\u2019s a lot going unsaid here besides you needing a dress code.", "So I am not even going to say\n YTA or NTA on this one because the fact you use refer to this a as a dress code says a lot.\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to ask him not to wear inappropriate graphics that is cartoon  genitalia to see his grandmother and I think most 20 year olds would understand this.x\n\nMy parents would occasionally tell me to cover up a littler (but I was 15).    As I got older I became more conservative dress wise until I got married (and now divorced) to someone who at 28 began to speak to me the way you sound like you are to your son-   Wearing a hoodie to the grocery store suddenly became a issue - and I quote \u201cpeople would question my self respect because first impressions matter and you never know who you are going to meet\u201d. The more he pushed the more I went the other way.\n\nI would take a long hard think about how your wording and how that is almost certainly coming across to your son.    \n\nBut look if your like my ex and his family and clothing and first impressions are that important that you are willing to risk your relationship continue on.  \n\nAgain very against the inappropriate clothes with his grandma and if you spoke to him that it\n Is for her sake not yours I think he would change.", "ESH You should talk to the grandmother. Let her know your son is having a mental breakdown, isn\u2019t working, and dresses in vulgar clothing. Let her make the decision if she wants him invited or not. Choose an informal restaurant to meet at as a compromise if she wants to see him.", "YWBTA - don't invite him if you're so concerned that his clothes would be offensive to grandma. If he's not going to dress up for a restaurant he's not going to do it for your house dinner.", "YYA. Sweatpants don\u2019t make you a slob", "YTA", "Yeah, yta.  There are two possible situations here.  He has legitimate complaints.  Or he is a drama queen? \nIt sounds like your son wants to be the victim.  Is he playing the game of doing what he knows will annoy you then claiming his victim crown when you react?  If I was in your shoes I would explain to the gf I want to build a good relationship with you.  I don't want to put you in the middle then quit using her as a go between.  Text your son and ask what do I do to repair this relationship.  \nIf he doesn't reply give family a heads up about his behaviors and carry on like nothing is wrong.", "YTA", "My mother wants to see him and I\u2019ve told her to not get her hopes up.

You don\u2019t go to birthday dinners and spend Thanksgiving with a person you have no relationship with. \u201cEstranged\u201d seems kind of hyperbolic. This sounds like countless other stories where the son moves in with the GF and stays home in sweatpants playing video games. Mom\u2019s upset because her son doesn\u2019t call and she sees him as a lazy layabout. She thinks he won\u2019t show up because he\u2019s too lazy and self centered, not out of spite.
