Last week, my wife had a UTI and was obviously not 100% . On Tuesday morning, she asked if I could take the whole day off to help her and look after our child. I said I couldn't because I had a really busy work day but would keep our daughter with me when I didn't have meetings and have her play with her toys or watch TV. She was upset about this. The next morning she was feeling a bit better physically but again asked if I could take the day off. I had another busy day and said no but I could do the same thing as the previous day.  On both days, I took care of our child all day except for 2 hours when I had work meetings.\n\nShe completely lost it and said I don't put her and our child first. She said my work should understand if I have to take 2 days off if she is sick. We are on our own and do not have family in the same province. She said she was in pain and I didn't care but prioritized my work instead.

With companies playing games about remote work and yanking it away, this is not the time to endanger that kind of position by simply calling out for 2 days when you really could handle most of what needed to be done without taking sick days. I've had UTIs and I get that they are miserable, but I'm not sure how much more your wife expected you to do.", "You took care of your child most of the day except the 2 hours that you had reunions (add this info to the main post or you will be roasted in minutes). I\u2019m a woman, I had a lot of UTI due a morphology problem, and I believe that you are NTA.\n\nEd: grammar", "NTA.  She was actually lucky that you work from home and could watch your child as much as you did.  Right now if I was dead dog sick I would still have to crawl my way to work never mind trying to take time off for a sick spouse.  I understand her wanting to rest and get better but welcome to life with kids.", "NTA- parenting happens when you're sick, tired, frustrated etc. While I realize uti's suck you also have to have a job to support your family and you took care of the baby most the day.", "NTA - I\u2019ve never expected my husband to take a day off to help me take care of the kids if I\u2019m sick. He has worked from home on the occasions where I\u2019m sick enough I can\u2019t function - but he\u2019s still working and also taking care of the kids.", "NTA, but I think you & your wife need to work hard find back-up childcare.  It worked (just ) this time, but might not next.  Sometimes, yes, you will need to prioritise work but the price shouldn't *have* to be that your ill wife picks up the slack.", "NTA. You were watching a toddler and working at the same time, giving her precious time to be unconscious and heal. Truly, what is she mad about? That you used screens and weren't down on the floor with Child, completely engaged?? I would argue this is the best use of screens because you were otherwise unavoidably engaged. Did she want you to snuggle in bed with her and bring her things to eat? It's not like you could osmosis the UTI out of her. If it's a severe enough that she's bedridden and has a fever, she should be getting medical help, not yelling at you because you're not helping exactly the way she wants.", "NTA\n\nYou needed to work. Parenting doesn\u2019t stop, even if you are sick. You basically took all the childcare and she still complained\u2026 ungrateful", "NTA you were home and took over care for most of the day, aside for a couple of hours when you absolutely couldn't.", "uhh NTA. women go to work all the time with a uti. they suck, but you're not bedridden. \n\nyour sick days are for you to use when *you're* sick, and you said you took care of your child all day, except for two hours.", "NTA", "NTA your wife is being overly demanding, good luck with having her return to work.", "Nah, life is hard when you have to balance illness work and kids. You tried your best, and she is in lot of pain.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m a nanny. In 25 years I\u2019ve only seen one or two dads that would do as much as you did. \n\nYou helped her as much as you possibly could.

Sounds like someone isn\u2019t feeling special.", "NTA - your wife is lucky you work from home and had the ability to balance having your daughter with you the bulk of the day.\n\nUTIs suck, but you had the kid with you for most of the day. What else did she expect you to do. I get that one year olds can be very busy, but that's what playpens are for. If your daughter was able to sit in your office and occupy herself without it interfering much with your work, I can only assume she would be the same sitting in a different room with your wife.\n\nI'm in year one of parenting and yeah it sucks the big one to be sick and still having to parent. It's even worse when the whole house is sick at the same time. So kid is having a meltdown and both parents just want to pass out.\n\nYou guys need to figure out some kind of alternative for childcare to take the pressure off though.", "NTA - if neither of you have a job and the money grows tight, it's going to be 100x worse for everyone including the kid. Also, you may have been on the clock all day, but you were basically taking the day off to look after your kid except for the important meetings so you don't fall behind.\n\nI get your wife is in pain, but I don't think UTIs force someone to be bedridden", "NTA. my partner have I have both gone to work (and he has a fairly physical job) with UTIs before. You helped her out for most of the day except when you absolutely had to take meetings. She's being unreasonable.\n\nETA: I understand the range of pain/discomfort is pretty broad for UTIs. You didn't mention her going to urgent care or anything, which she should have if she's in so much pain she can't watch your kid for 2 hours. I'm judging just off of the info provided in the post.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who is a SAHM of a 4 year old and a 2 year old who we've all had the flu and fianc\u00e9 has still had to go to work literally all day, I wish I could have the help you're giving.", "INFO: did your wife seek treatment for the UTI or is this a self diagnosis? I had a UTI turn into a bladder infection once. Some of the worst pain of my life.

You went above & beyond for her & she still wasn\u2019t satisfied. \n\nEdit:  spelling, grammar & additional sentences", "NTA\n\nI guess you could get fired and then you'll be able to watch your kid all day, but then you'll be a loser without a job to her. Can't win these days.", "NTA - I can\u2019t speak for her, but the uti\u2019s I\u2019ve had were annoying at best and a little painful at worst. Not something I would need an SO to stay home for. I think you\u2019ve handled the situation well. \nGo get her some cranberry juice ( real juice not the kind with sugar in it cause that will make it worse) it will help to heal! Hydrate hydrate hydrate!!There\u2019s a pressure point in the cushion of your right thumb, push it for 30 seconds, it will take the burning sensation away and also helps with not having to pee every minute. Source: me; who\u2019s had a lot of uti\u2019s ( drink your water peeps and please pee after sex) and got rid of them with cranberry juice and the pressure point. \nIf the uti is so bad that she\u2019s bedridden she needs to get to a doctor asap. Uti\u2019s can turn into kidney infections and those hurts like a mf and take long to heal from.", "I can\u2019t make a judgment for a couple reasons\u2026\n1.) from what I understand UTI\u2019s can be pretty painful \n\n2.) I believe if you\u2019re not aware if you have one and don\u2019t get treatment it can get worse (correct me if I am wrong) and get serious \n\n3.) if she knew she had one did she not have time to go to the doctor?", "NAH, but you should take time to take care of your wife when she's sick as well as your daughter. Take the PTO offered when your family needs you. \n\nI know a couple who are divorcing over the same situation. In their case, there was a pattern of lack of caring, so it wasn't a single incident. But with the way your wife lost it, are you sure it isn't a pattern in your case?", "[deleted]", "If your job is flexible about your work, they can be flexible in allowing you to tend to your wife while she has a UTI, which can be absolutely and painfully debilitating.\n\nIf she can't care for herself, how is she supposed to care for your 1YO?\n\nYTA. Family comes first.", "NAH. Both of you were \"right\" from your point of view.\nI just think like, what happens when she is rreeaally sick for more than 2 days, say 2 weeks or more? Will everything work out?\n\n- Get some kind of babysitter, show them everything in advance, so they can come to help in case of emergency.\n\n- Get into a union to get PTO if you don't have anything like that already\n\n- Already look for other jobs, so that IF you get laid off, you don't have to start your search from scratch. Also, start now to get your CV and job applying documents ready or updated.\n\n- Get your work stuff in order so that a colleague can easily take over if you have to take the day off unexpectedly. Like, check that no data is saved locally, but everything is somehow shared with others. Document your processes, how far are you in which project and what needs to be done next. Of course this really depends on your job, just an idea to get organized if you aren't already.\n- Also, couldnt you take the day off, EXCEPT for your Meetings? Like of course prepare for them, but try to do the afterwards paperwork later or ask someone else?\n\n- Your wife should do the same. Also, talk about the workload and especially the mental load will be high when she starts to work. Both of you should remember to work as a team and communicate.\n\n- Also, a sick person should try not to get angry too fast. When I was sick the last time, I was angry at my bf fpr not heating up all the food I wanted to eat and forgot something in the fridge. I thought he didnt care about me at all and wants me to starve. Yeah right. \nAnd that's how it might feel for your wife, just overwhelmed by feeling sick and the responsibilities.", "NAH. You took care of your child for all but a couple hours while your wife had a minor illness. That should be enough for her to rest when she needed to. Also, I personally have never considered taking time off work (12+ hour night shifts) for myself when I had a UTI. I certainly wouldn\u2019t interrupt my husband\u2019s busy work day over a couple hours of child care. It shouldn\u2019t be that bad, unless it\u2019s something more serious like a kidney infection.", "YTA, taking care of your child when your wife is unable to comes before your work.", "NAH. I don't know where you are, but assume somewhere without the liberal sick leave policies of the Nordics. Ideally you should be able to take a day off to look after your baby without fear for your job, and your wife should be allowed to heal up properly (and a UTI can be debilitating, and a symptom of serious issues, don't say \"women can work with that.\" Some can, some can't.) The system should provide for situations like this. Instead we argue out of fear about who should take a day off. That is the real problem here.", "Yes. YTA \n\nUTI\u2019s are excruciating. \nDid she go to the doctor? How is she treating the infection? They can hurt so bad that the only thing you feel like doing is sitting in a bathtub of hot water.", "TA here is the American healthcare system (I'm assuming you're in a country that doesn't give PTO for sick leave)\n\njoin a union, get sick leave for you and caring for your dependents (wife is not a dependent, but caring for people you live with should be fucking standard. like, what is this, Matilda? soup's on the stove you're off to play bingo??)\n\nIf you get PTO, then Y T A", "YTA", "Who took care of your child?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
