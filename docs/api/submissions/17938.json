I said I couldn't because I had a really busy work day but would keep our daughter with me when I didn't have meetings and have her play with her toys or watch TV. She was upset about this. The next morning she was feeling a bit better physically but again asked if I could take the day off. I had another busy day and said no but I could do the same thing as the previous day.  On both days, I took care of our child all day except for 2 hours when I had work meetings.\n\nShe completely lost it and said I don't put her and our child first. She said my work should understand if I have to take 2 days off if she is sick. We are on our own and do not have family in the same province.

That you used screens and weren't down on the floor with Child, completely engaged?? I would argue this is the best use of screens because you were otherwise unavoidably engaged. Did she want you to snuggle in bed with her and bring her things to eat? It's not like you could osmosis the UTI out of her.

Take the PTO offered when your family needs you. \n\nI know a couple who are divorcing over the same situation. In their case, there was a pattern of lack of caring, so it wasn't a single incident.

Family comes first.", "NAH. Both of you were \"right\" from your point of view.\nI just think like, what happens when she is rreeaally sick for more than 2 days, say 2 weeks or more? Will everything work out?\n\n- Get some kind of babysitter, show them everything in advance, so they can come to help in case of emergency.\n\n- Get into a union to get PTO if you don't have anything like that already\n\n- Already look for other jobs, so that IF you get laid off, you don't have to start your search from scratch. Also, start now to get your CV and job applying documents ready or updated.\n\n- Get your work stuff in order so that a colleague can easily take over if you have to take the day off unexpectedly. Like, check that no data is saved locally, but everything is somehow shared with others. Document your processes, how far are you in which project and what needs to be done next. Of course this really depends on your job, just an idea to get organized if you aren't already.\n- Also, couldnt you take the day off, EXCEPT for your Meetings? Like of course prepare for them, but try to do the afterwards paperwork later or ask someone else?\n\n- Your wife should do the same. Also, talk about the workload and especially the mental load will be high when she starts to work. Both of you should remember to work as a team and communicate.\n\n- Also, a sick person should try not to get angry too fast. When I was sick the last time, I was angry at my bf fpr not heating up all the food I wanted to eat and forgot something in the fridge. I thought he didnt care about me at all and wants me to starve. Yeah right. \nAnd that's how it might feel for your wife, just overwhelmed by feeling sick and the responsibilities.", "NAH. You took care of your child for all but a couple hours while your wife had a minor illness. That should be enough for her to rest when she needed to.

We don\u2019t know the severity of what she was dealing with in terms of pain or urgency or potential in contingency or what type of medication she was on.\n\nMy first uti I literally wound up peeing so much blood my urine was a deep red, was in so much pain I couldn\u2019t sleep or concentrate or do anything other than lay in the bathtub not able to control my bladder, and then was put on antibiotics so strong I had to take a whole week off work because within 2 hours of taking them (and I had 3x a day dosage) I was throwing up.", "NTA - she\u2019s being emotional and blowing this out of proportion.  She should be thanking you for stepping up.  You made the right decision, especially given the fact your company recently had layoffs.  She may just need some attention or tlc herself.", "NTA....

I've taken of SCORES of hours ferrying my wife to and from appointments.\n\nI'm sorry your work is so inflexible. Mine is fine with us taking sick time for family members. How do you think parents get time off when their kids are sick?", "fun fact: UTIs can lead to sepsis/death and it's partially because people downplay them all of the time  \nnot discounting the ruling but getting pretty annoyed with everyone saying \"oh it's *just* an UTI\"", "You are a bad manager. I don\u2019t care why my team is taking off.

Taking unpaid leave may not be possible either depending on their financial situation since OP is the only one working. Doubly so when companies are downsizing and still recovering from covid. While it absolutely sucks, this could be seen as reason to let someone go. \n\nWhy should he even have to take a whole 2 days off because he couldn't look after their kid for 2 hours each day? That's absolutely ridiculous.", "Yeah, I'm a little surprised (though not really, reddit) at the gatekeeping of UTI pain. Just because one's own UTI wasn't very painful doesn't mean someone else can't have felt more pain.", "Another really good supplement is \"d-mannose\".  There are a bunch of YouTube videos by urologists and the like suggesting d-mannose as a preventative / early treatment for uncomplicated UTIs.

Some of these patients are incredibly sick (there should never be *that* much puss in your pee....) and the infection get get into your blood...which as you might imagine, is *bad*. If it was that bad for my partner, I'd definitely be taking him to the hospital and probably be too worried to work. \n\nHowever, from what I can tell of the post (which tbf is inherently skewed in OP's perspective), OP's wife wasn't asking him to take a day off to take care of her medically, but to watch their kid... Which he did, while working.", "Azo has a permanent place in our emergency kits.  It doesn't do anything for the infection itself, but it's a life-saver for the pain and the feeling that you have to pee.

You guys *need* help.", "Oh yeah, that stuff is amazing! Orange pee is a feature.", "Azo has an antibacterial for UTI med as well that\u2019s sold OTC. It\u2019s not strong enough to cure an infection but it sure helps to start the process till you can get to your doctor.

Thanks!", "I\u2019ve had UTIs some were mild and others extremely painful, with that being said I still managed to go into the office and work while on meds.

You touch her for emotional connection, not just to initiate sex?  She gets a chance to be clean and sit quietly after being nursed on and touched out all day?  You talk to her as a person you actually love, someone you get to share your day with, and not just another soldier in the parenting trenches?  Are you keeping up with the mental load tracking the baby wellness visits, when the shots are due, making and keeping the doctor visits?  When you go out, who is in charge of filling the diaper bag, making sure there are nappies, who remembers the hats and sunscreen?  Do you shoulder the burden of tantrums, meltdowns, bath time, bed time, and other non-fun stuff fairly, or do you get to be Disneyland dad?  \n\nShe was in pain and crabby, and yeah she was a little unreasonable to ask for you to take time off.  Maybe after 9 months of growing a human and the year of post-partum body changes and such, getting a UTI is just one more kick in the pants and she took it out on you.  But maybe, to her, it was just one more example where she\u2019s left unsupported and left to shoulder the load alone.  It\u2019s worth talking to her about it and see she needs more from you.", "NTA, you took care of the kid for most of your work day. I never asked my now ex to take of a day if I was sick. You sort-of just suck it up and deal with it.  I mean UTis are no fun but you can still function just fine. You might not be the most involved parent  those day and may need to resort to some cartoons but that's ok.", "NTA, as a parent you sometimes take care of your kids while sick and in pain. You did the best you could.", "NAH.  She's sick and feels awful, you are helpful and realistic. Make sure she gets to the doctor.", "Exactly this. NTA op. Times are hard all over right now. There's a pyramid of hierarchical needs somewhere, and while in many western countries we get to upper tiers, everyone worldwide seems to be feeling the pain of having to adjust to lower tiers.

Like the seasons...", "Just pointing out that not everyone can work from home, and every family's ability to cope with sickness is different: age of kid/s, number of kids, needs of kids (high vs low attention needs, neurodivergent, other health conditions) how many people in the home are sick, how sick, different pain tolerances, mental state (e.g. PPD) - all play a role.\n\nGoing by the OP I'm not saying that the above applies to them specifically, just pointing out that your situation isn't everyone's, and whilst financial needs and job obligations do matter, we all need to be able to ask for help when we need it. And that looks different for everyone.\n\nTo OP: sounds like you did a good job and looked after your family. Without knowing your wife or if she has a habit of making a big deal out of something small, I'm going to hold space for her being in pain and potentially just overwhelmed and not handling things well.
