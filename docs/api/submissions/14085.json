The scooter itself was not cheap, at $1500, plus mods puts it over $2000.\n\nI have a sister(43f) and a nephew(13m) who I always let housesit for me while I\u2019m out of town on business. I have pets and plants that I need taken care of and they always welcome a change of scenery. So I had to go on a business trip last month for a week and let them house sit. My nephew has always asked me about my scooter and I told him that it isn\u2019t for kids because it\u2019s extremely fast and I\u2019ve expressly  forbidden him from riding it multiple times. His mother knows about this as well.\n\nWell, I come back from my trip and my sister tells me that I\u2019m going to be mad, but my nephew took my scooter out, left it unattended and had it stolen. I was fucking pissed and asked them to leave.\n\nI told them they\u2019d have to replace it and my sister pleaded with me, they couldn\u2019t afford it, it was a mistake and that he could do just do chores around my house to pay me back. I told her that it doesn\u2019t replace my scooter. She said that any money would have to come from their vacation fund. I said, tough shit.\n\nOur parents have gotten involved and said that I\u2019m taking it too far. They agree that my nephew should be punished and I should be paid back, but to take away their family vacation is just cruel and petty. They suggested a payment plan. I told them, hell no, that I use my scooter to commute to work often and that I wanted it back immediately. Furthermore, he was warned not to ride it since it\u2019s dangerous. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve started to calm down here a little, I wonder if I\u2019m being an Ahole here by being so demanding and potentially punishing everyone else for my nephew\u2019s mistake.", "created_utc": 1680730385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cyp5n/aita_for_wanting_my_sister_to_pay_me_back_because/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd get hard. Demand a payment plan, or involve the law. In many states, four figures is grand theft.", "NTA. Screw their vacation if they can't even make their kid to listen to simple instructions, for example \"don't touch my scooter\".", "NTA\n\nI'd make a payment plan, just to show I'm reasonable and also take the offer on house chores. Not as a payment, of course. Let's call it a free \"F\u00d7ck around and find out\" lesson.", "NTA. you aren\u2019t talking about a little damage that leaves it still usable. It\u2019s gone. You need it for the purposes you use it for. Consequently, they need to replace it immediately.\n\nIf that means no vacation for the brat, that seems like a fair punishment ON TOP of the required restitution of paying for the new scooter.", "ESH. \n\nObviously your nephew shouldn't have taken the scooter out. \n\nBut your sister's suggestion of a payment plan is a smart compromise that you shouldn't have shot down. \n\nWith the payment plan, you are (eventually) made whole, your nephew learns a valuable lesson and your relationship with your family remains intact. \n\nForcing them to cancel their vacation and pay it all back now will only ruin your relationship with them.", "Sister needs to pay for it and nephew can work for HER! She's culpable, as well.\n\nNTA", "NTA and don\u2019t cave.", "NTA. 13 is more than old enough to know to respect stuff that isn't yours, and also old enough to have real world consequences for your fuckups.", "NTA - your nephew knew he wasn't suppose to take the scooter and so did your sister, yet he did take it and it was stolen.  He is responsible and so is she.\n\nIf they lose a vacation so what, maybe it will teach them to abide by your rules and listen.  Your parents are enabling their grandson and daughter by saying it's too harsh, no it's not.  He basically stole the scooter and is lucky you aren't pressing charges for theft.  In fact your Sister is teaching him it's okay to take things because he wants to and she'll cover for him.", "NTA. He stole your scooter & was careless with it. Paying you back especially if it means he misses his vacation might teach him a necessary lesson. I get that your sister will lose her vacation, too. Maybe that will teach her something about the consequences of poor parenting.", "Clarification do you pay your sister to house sit your pets and plants?  How many and what kind of pets?", "NTA the mom should have paid attention. The mom is responsible for them losing their vacation fund. You are not responsible. You should not have to wait for a payment plan.", "INFO you keep saying you \"let them\" housesit and take care of your plants and animals, as if you were the one doing them a favour? It's really weird. They are the ones putting their time and money into house sitting for you, saving you money on making other arrangements. Will you at least account for this?", "NTA Maybe they can put their holiday on a payment plan. A holiday is a want, not a need. Tough luck their kid was irresponsible with something they couldn't afford to replace easily. Maybe should have instilled in the kid not to touch others property", "NTA for wanting to be paid back for your sister allowing her son to use the scooter you have expressly said no to, and then it getting stolen. \n\nBut can I ask why you keep saying you \"let\" them housesit for you, like you are being ever so gracious to allow them to do housework for you when you are out of town?", "NTA. They were told not to mess with it. The kid didn't listen and now they need to make it right.", "**ESH.** Anyone entering into a business relationship with family & friends should know that these arrangmeent will most likely come with extra baggage like this. \n\nThey are attempting to make you whole with the payment plan. Your nephew shouldn't have taken the scooter out -and- **you should have known better then to never mix family and business**. This is what happens. Are you ready to create a rift because it'll take your sister too long to pay you back?", "Obv your sister is the person responsible here, nephew should be punished, you should be compensated and are absolutely justified in being pissed.\n\nAs to demanding money right now... if it would dip into their basic necessities fund that would be definitelly shitty. Vacation is not a necessity though\u2014break from work/school is, but spending that in a fun place is an indulgence.\n\nI'd say, if you want to be gracious, ask for the price of the unmodded scooter now so you can replace it and for the rest of the money later. But you're not doing them any grave harm by expecting them to fix the damage they've caused ASAP at the cost of their vacation.", "INFO: Do you have the money necessary to replace the scooter on your own? If you do I think a payment plan is fair if not how much spare income could you spare toward a replacement? You could have them cover what you can't since you need it to get to work then have a payment plan to pay off the rest.", "NTA. Your sister should pay you. Your parents can pay money into your sister's vacation budget. Your sister can make payments back to your parents. Solved.", "NTA.  This is 100% your sister's fault.  She's responsible.  This is an expensive enough item to expect repayment, not to mention it is your way to commute to work.", "NTA - Everyone involved knew this was off limits. An immediate replacement  is needed. They are 'tagging' the money as vacation. Money is money; not your issue how they perceive where it comes from. Wrong/risky behavior without consequences leads to it happening again.\n\n\\*\\*You can submit a claim to your home insurance (?) but it may jack your rate.  Folks who work insurance may weigh-in or consider r/Insurance, r/InsuranceProfessional", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n13 years old is old enough to accept responsibility for his actions; and his mother is just as culpable as his guardian.  Your nephew needs to learn to respect other people's belongings, and although it sucks to lose their vacation, expensive lessons are often the most impactful.", "NTA but you can\u2019t get blood from a stone, work out a payment plan, plus chores for emotional distress", "NTA. You\u2019re holding them accountable, and it\u2019s completely justified. To hell with their vacation, they can learn common decency in the meantime.", "INFO: did you pay them to housesit? Sounds like there was a need for someone to stay and take care of your plants and pets so I assume they must have been compensated?", "NTA.\nTechnically he stole it. You forbid him from using it. His mother didn't check on him and now the scooter is gone. Stolen again but from a stranger.\nIt is expensive and as a 13 year old he should know better.\nI wouldn't care about them dipping in the vacation fund. They should pay you back right away.", "NTA. Tell your sister you'll set up a payment plan with her and your nephew. You can set something up thats super easy on their wallet while recouping your loss.\n\nEither they pay over time or you'll go to small claims court.\n\nEdit: I'm dumb and can't read", "NTA. Repaying you comes before a vacation. You need it to commute to work. Their neglect caused it to be stolen so they need to face the consequences, especially since it was expressly forbidden that he ride it.", "NTA So your nephew stole your electric scooter, only to have it stolen from him and you feel like the AH ?", "NTA for being upset and wanting money back. Do think about the long term effect tho. Make the lil mofo learn from this to ensure he turns into a better adult.", "Yeah man, I understand your anger and while he is 13 and should know better, he is 13.\n\nI would let them do the payment plan, no need to make both of your lives difficult and potentially drive a wedge/burn bridges.\n\nHaving said that, you should take your sister up on her offer to have the kid do chores as well. Cleaning toilets and the like.\n\nAlso, the whole \"tough shit\" response to your sisters pleas sounds so...unnecessary. \n\nI think if you're not into compromise here, YWBTA.", "NTA he can pay the holiday fund back\u2026", "NTA, I'd be just as livid as you, and your sister should full well pay for it back.\n\nIf paying the money would put them in a tough spot then I'd understand the payment option, but if its only because \"mah vacation\" then I'd get the money back asap.\n\nEdit: actually the payment plan option would be good if they accept paying interest.", "NTA.\n\nIf they would [starve trying to pay you back](https://americanliterature.com/author/guy-de-maupassant/short-story/the-necklace), sure.  If they are denied a vacation? Sucks to be a bad parent.\n\nIf this was California, it is illegal to ride such a scooter without a driver's license.", "NTA.\n\nShe should watch over her kid better. Also where were the keys?", "Get them a tent for their budget vacation NTA", "NTA. \n\nThey owe you $2000 or the exact same scooter with all the same mods. This isn't that hard.", "NTA\nA vacation is not a necessity. Plus, I wonder if the mother encouraged the son saying OP wouldn't find out. Or she might not have. Either way, parents are responsible for the mistakes of their children, so you teach them better. And if the mom knew it could have been an issue, could have kept an extra eye on her son. \n\nSome parents keep on enabling bad behaviour, maybe they will learn better to not do that. It's just a vacation, while the scooter is a main mode of transportation to work - a necessity. Could OP file a police report for theft and get home insurance involved? I feel like they have more important things to consider rather than losing their vacation, like if OP decides to go through the police for theft of their scooter.", "I don\u2019t understand the Y-T-A votes. I knew better than to steal other people\u2019s vehicles at the age of 13. Your sister is an asshole for enabling your nephew to steal your property, and she has a lot of gall to suggest paying back in chores. Actions have consequences. They are lucky you didn\u2019t call the cops. They are lucky that their son wasn\u2019t injured. And also payment plans are bullshit. They will not pay you back. They can skip vacation for a year.\n\nNTA", "Light NTA. You have every right to demand payment for this. However, and pending if you have the funds yourself, I think a payment plan sounds reasonable.", "NTA\n\nFamily vacation is luxury. They can skip a year to teach their kid a lesson and to learn a lesson of their own: have an insurance. (Even though the insurance possibly wouldn\u2018t pay in this situation because the kid isn\u2018t that young anymore.) \n\nIt\u2018s not like they have to cut their food or every day life to pay you.", "NTA\n\nShe is responsible for her child when he breaks or lose's someone else's property.\n\nHis consequence is they don't get as big a vacation this year. That's actually a good punishment for him.", "NTA. Substitute car with scooter and we\u2019d would be hearing this about your nephew", "NTA\n\nMight behoove you to set up a payment plan with them, though. Feels like that\u2019s the path to getting your money back while also keeping a good relationship with your family.", "NTA\nMaybe you can ask for half the amount now and work out the payment plan for rest of the amount.", "What kind of punishment did she suggest? When you lose, destroy, or cause to be stolen something of such large value\u2026.the punishment should absolutely hurt! \n\nLet\u2019s be honest, OP. His mom likely knew that he took the scooter. And he\u2019d likely taken it before. \n\nTaking away their vacation fund seems entirely reasonable to me. \n\nNTA", "*She said that any money would have to come from their vacation fund.*\n\nIf replacing the scooter meant they'd have to use money reserved for basic necessities (rent or mortgage/food/utilities), then I'd say you may want to reconsider the payment plan option. But if they're upset because they can't take a vacation this year because of this, then tough shit. NTA.", "YTA kid was in the wrong but also... he is 13, not exactly an age renown for good sense and obedience. Kids will be irresponsible and it seems insane to me that you left the scooter fully accessible to a kid. Should he have taken it out? Absolutely not, but him doing so isn't *suprising*. They didn't try to hide it from you or claim someone broke in. Should you be paid back in full? Yes, perfectly reasonable. But is having a scooter *now* worth blowing up your family because you won't compromise on a payment plan?", "NTA. I bet this isn't the first time ever that nephew took it out either. Sister probably covered for him until it was stolen and she couldn't hide it from you.", "NTA--When I break something of someone else's it's not even a question.  I am replacing it.  People will politely decline but I think it's just the right thing to do.  I am teaching my daughter the same.  This isn't even a situation of your nephew borrowing it and breaking it.  He used it without your permission and then was irresponsible and it was stolen.  \n\nI do think a reasonable payment plan should be acceptable though.", "NTA. You expressed multiple times to not use it and he went behind your back and it was stolen. Also the fact it seems they waited to tell you is definitely not ok. Actions have consequences.", "NTA. Maybe your parents can lend them money for the vacation and let them pay them back on a payment plan?", "She should have thought of the consequences before letting her son use the scooter when it was specifically forbidden. She has the money so should pay it. Simple. Payment plan doesn\u2019t help OP because he uses it for work. Sister already ruined their relationship by going against his wishes. That\u2019s all on her and her son. \n\nNTA", "How do you pay those who steal from you?", "What a ridiculous take. Having a family member house-sit is not \"business\" and the nephew is a thief. The sister 100% needs to make things whole here.", "How do you get to ESH when the victim of a theft wants to be made whole?", "Yup. This is his family. As in his family should have respected him enough to leave the scooter alone. The sister created the rift, not him.", "I think a lot hangs on this (or, for example, if the sister could borrow $2K from the parents to repay OP, and then have a payment plan to the parents).\n\nOP does need to be made good here; both sister and nephew were well aware he'd explicitly said 'no' to any play involving the scooter, and it was careless beyond belief of the kid to leave it unattended and get it stolen.\n\nI do think the sister is taking the piss somewhat with \"oh he could just do some chores to work it off\".", "Sure, I have the extra cash, but that's not really it, it's more about the principal of the matter. I put a lot of time, effort and money into that scooter and I told him no multiple times. Plus his mom enabled him by letting him take it out. Not to mention it's how I commute to work 70% of the time. I own a car which I've been using since, but I like the scooter because it's Eco friendly and more fun to ride.\n\nAdmittedly I am bring petty not taking the payment plan, but I want them, particularly my nephew to understand consequences. But maybe that's not the best option here.", "This", "I don't think I'd let the nephew back into my home after that, already has proven that he cannot be trusted.", "They offered a payment plan, OP said no to that", "As somebody who knows several kids around that age, they aren't stupid. He ABSOLUTELY knew what he was doing when he STOLE that scooter. He's not 5.", "Compromise is good if someone can't afford to pay you back.  They can they just rather take a vacation. \n\nI'm going to assume the sister is an adult. An adult who either while housesitting wasn't paying attention to her son and allowed him to steal from the person she's housesitting for or she willingly allowed him to.  No blame on the 13 year old but the adult shouldn't get a pass because she needs a vacay", "Wow you just took me back to high school English class", "But they have the funds too....they just want to use it on a vacation. That's not a necessity like they need the money to pay their rent.", "Op uses the scooter to commute to work.", "13 is far past the age where he should know better. OP said said they use the scooter to commute to work, so yes, they need a replacement asap. OP is NTA.", "OP has ever right to be reimbursed. But, anytime you mix family and business you open yourself up to this kind of mess. OP should offer some flexibility on the repayment by accepting installments. If OP isn't willing to be flexible like this, then he probably should have never mixed business and family in the first place.", "Pet sitters are expensive. A good day care costs about 50 per dog per day. So depending if they gave free petsitting (no charge for the plant) he may not be out the full 2000. I don\u2019t agree that the kid should go unpunished but he might have already been given free services to a portion or if not all the amount so that needs to be taken into account.", "I'm arriving at ESH because it seems the family has offered a repayment plan which OP declined. This is what you get when you mix family and business (while no money was exchanged, his sister was providing a service for him).", "Don't cave. She and your nephew disregarded your very clear and reasonable instructions. If grandparents are worried about the vacation they can cover that expense and let her payment plan them back as another comment suggested.", "Shoot I missed that, thanks for the correction o7", "It's a fair point, I just feel bad for the other members of the family who had no part in this. But fair."]}
