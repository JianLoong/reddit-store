The scooter itself was not cheap, at $1500, plus mods puts it over $2000.\n\nI have a sister(43f) and a nephew(13m) who I always let housesit for me while I\u2019m out of town on business. I have pets and plants that I need taken care of and they always welcome a change of scenery. So I had to go on a business trip last month for a week and let them house sit. My nephew has always asked me about my scooter and I told him that it isn\u2019t for kids because it\u2019s extremely fast and I\u2019ve expressly  forbidden him from riding it multiple times. His mother knows about this as well.\n\nWell, I come back from my trip and my sister tells me that I\u2019m going to be mad, but my nephew took my scooter out, left it unattended and had it stolen. I was fucking pissed and asked them to leave.\n\nI told them they\u2019d have to replace it and my sister pleaded with me, they couldn\u2019t afford it, it was a mistake and that he could do just do chores around my house to pay me back. I told her that it doesn\u2019t replace my scooter. She said that any money would have to come from their vacation fund. I said, tough shit.\n\nOur parents have gotten involved and said that I\u2019m taking it too far. They agree that my nephew should be punished and I should be paid back, but to take away their family vacation is just cruel and petty. They suggested a payment plan. I told them, hell no, that I use my scooter to commute to work often and that I wanted it back immediately. Furthermore, he was warned not to ride it since it\u2019s dangerous. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve started to calm down here a little, I wonder if I\u2019m being an Ahole here by being so demanding and potentially punishing everyone else for my nephew\u2019s mistake.", "created_utc": 1680730385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cyp5n/aita_for_wanting_my_sister_to_pay_me_back_because/", "score": 1268, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents are enabling their grandson and daughter by saying it's too harsh, no it's not.  He basically stole the scooter and is lucky you aren't pressing charges for theft.  In fact your Sister is teaching him it's okay to take things because he wants to and she'll cover for him.", "NTA. He stole your scooter & was careless with it.

NTA.", "YTA kid was in the wrong but also... he is 13, not exactly an age renown for good sense and obedience. Kids will be irresponsible and it seems insane to me that you left the scooter fully accessible to a kid. Should he have taken it out? Absolutely not, but him doing so isn't *suprising*. They didn't try to hide it from you or claim someone broke in. Should you be paid back in full? Yes, perfectly reasonable. But is having a scooter *now* worth blowing up your family because you won't compromise on a payment plan?", "NTA. I bet this isn't the first time ever that nephew took it out either. Sister probably covered for him until it was stolen and she couldn't hide it from you.", "NTA--When I break something of someone else's it's not even a question.  I am replacing it.  People will politely decline but I think it's just the right thing to do.  I am teaching my daughter the same.  This isn't even a situation of your nephew borrowing it and breaking it.  He used it without your permission and then was irresponsible and it was stolen.  \n\nI do think a reasonable payment plan should be acceptable though.", "NTA. You expressed multiple times to not use it and he went behind your back and it was stolen. Also the fact it seems they waited to tell you is definitely not ok. Actions have consequences.", "NTA. Maybe your parents can lend them money for the vacation and let them pay them back on a payment plan?", "She should have thought of the consequences before letting her son use the scooter when it was specifically forbidden. She has the money so should pay it. Simple. Payment plan doesn\u2019t help OP because he uses it for work. Sister already ruined their relationship by going against his wishes. That\u2019s all on her and her son. \n\nNTA", "How do you pay those who steal from you?", "What a ridiculous take. Having a family member house-sit is not \"business\" and the nephew is a thief.

The sister created the rift, not him.", "I think a lot hangs on this (or, for example, if the sister could borrow $2K from the parents to repay OP, and then have a payment plan to the parents).\n\nOP does need to be made good here; both sister and nephew were well aware he'd explicitly said 'no' to any play involving the scooter, and it was careless beyond belief of the kid to leave it unattended and get it stolen.\n\nI do think the sister is taking the piss somewhat with \"oh he could just do some chores to work it off\".", "Sure, I have the extra cash, but that's not really it, it's more about the principal of the matter. I put a lot of time, effort and money into that scooter and I told him no multiple times. Plus his mom enabled him by letting him take it out. Not to mention it's how I commute to work 70% of the time. I own a car which I've been using since, but I like the scooter because it's Eco friendly and more fun to ride.\n\nAdmittedly I am bring petty not taking the payment plan, but I want them, particularly my nephew to understand consequences. But maybe that's not the best option here.\n\nEdit to add: And the biggest thing here and the reason I forbid him from riding it in the first place is that it's dangerous. You have to have experience riding these things, and they go very fast. Not to mention that I modified it so that it goes even faster.\n\nThere are far safer scooters out there for teenagers and I was thinking of getting him one for his birthday in the summer.", "This", "I don't think I'd let the nephew back into my home after that, already has proven that he cannot be trusted.", "They offered a payment plan, OP said no to that", "As somebody who knows several kids around that age, they aren't stupid.

They can they just rather take a vacation. \n\nI'm going to assume the sister is an adult.

If OP isn't willing to be flexible like this, then he probably should have never mixed business and family in the first place.", "Pet sitters are expensive. A good day care costs about 50 per dog per day. So depending if they gave free petsitting (no charge for the plant) he may not be out the full 2000. I don\u2019t agree that the kid should go unpunished but he might have already been given free services to a portion or if not all the amount so that needs to be taken into account.", "[deleted]", "Don't cave.

But fair.", "1. First of all, if god forbid, your cousin had been injured, killed himself, or caused an accident on the road, YOU could be sued, and people could have gotten hurt. This is a very serious breach of your trust and should be treated as such. \n\n2. Your sister *knew* her son was desperate to ride the scooter and SHE did nothing to assure that he would leave it alone. He didn\u2019t \u201ctake the scooter and left it unattended\u201d. The kid straight up STOLE the scooter and got it stolen. \n\n3. If he left it unattended, it is reasonable to assume he used the scooter multiple times. Kids who are sneaking a vehicle of any kind, are usually not wanting to get caught, so they put it back after using it. Getting distracted and leaving a scooter lying somewhere around tells me that it wasn\u2019t a one off, and possibly that Mommy knew. \n\n4. They HAVE the money to replace it. The fact that they want to go on vacation with said funds, instead of replacing your commute scooter immediately is not your problem. Your nephew is the one responsible for them not having the money to go have fun.\n\n5. Your parents agree that nephew *should* be punished. (Was a swift punishment not issued by mommy immediately? If so, what? Like no TV for 10 minutes?) Good, tell them that his punishment should be HIM, NOT YOUR SISTER, doing chores for his mother so she can pay back the vacation money. Additionally, he can mow lawns, wash cars etc for neighbors, to help her pay you back\u2026\u2026As if this kid should be rewarded with a vacation after pulling such a dangerous and costly stunt anyway\u2026\u2026\n\n6. If he had stolen a neighbor\u2019 scooter used for commuting and got it stolen, would your sister beg them to let *her* do chores? Actions have consequences. This child fucked around and should find out what it means to lose privileges like a costly vacation. IMO, your nephew also should take responsibility by writing you a letter of apology outlining how risky and inconsiderate he was with his actions. \n\n6. You are not being unreasonably demanding, and it is not you who is \u201cpunishing everyone else\u201d. In fact, it ridiculous they are trying to guilt you into letting this slide, like you are in some way responsible for any of this. DO NOT agree to a payment plan, this is opening yourself up to a host if future problems\u2026\u2026..Let your parents fund the vacation of their daughter\u2019s family if it\u2019s so important for their precious baby and grandson to have one. \n\n\nNTA.

She doesn't have to pay medical or legal bills because she was unable to tell her son no.", "NTA. Losing out on a vacation in order to pay you back is a natural consequence, and a reasonable one for your sister as well as your nephew.

Tough luck buttercup, pay your sister, and perhaps Junior can learn a little lesson in values by helping seniors, single parents, any neighbour who needs a hand during the time he should be on vacation.

Give them a deadline of a few days and let them know that if they don't pay you by then, you'll report it stolen and press charges against the nephew. He stole your transportation.

The nephew is going to learn there are no consequences to his theft. He steals and then gets to have a nice vacation, too bad, so sad for his victim.", "NTA. If you want to (and can afford it) I\u2019d recommend buy a replacement yourself and setting up a repayment plan. Money not chores around the house because I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t want the added work of supervising a 13 year old boy for weeks on end. His parents can deal with that.\n\nIf you can\u2019t or just don\u2019t want to take the immediate financial hit, it\u2019s completely reasonable to ask for a replacement scooter.

It is not a toy. It is the vehicle you use to commute to work. If he'd joyridden in a car and had it stolen, police would likely be involved.
