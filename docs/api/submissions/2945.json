It's a pretty unique, flowery tie that really matches the suits, but is generally a ballsy style. I brought it to my parents house after the wedding, as they picked me up and it's generally where I keep some things of mine, since I own a smallish apartment with not much storage.\n\nThis is relevant.\n\nThe wedding was about 3 years ago, and it's a very important gift to me. I found out yesterday, on the way back from a trip with my family (including my mother, dad, older sister (36), brother-in-law, and their two kiddos) that my mother had cut my tie in half to use as a marker for their luggage. I waited at the carousel to grab their luggage, and when I handed it to her I asked her where she got the \"ribbon\" and it got bad from there. \n\nI got very, very upset, not because it was malicious, but because she knew it was mine (she stated this as I asked) and assumed I wouldn't care, she never asked me if it was an important tie or if she could cut it in half (answer would've been no) and this isn't the first time she's done something like that.\n\nSo I said, \"what the fuck, why would you do that?\" And while she tried to reply I walked off and said \"I can't talk to you, don't talk to me.\"\n\nAwkward car ride back to say the least.\n\nI stewed for awhile, and by the end of the ride back from the airport, I decided I'd try to make amends, BUT then she decided to be petty make a smug remark to our driver (my cousin) saying that The family gift we got them wasn't from US, no no, it was only from her and my dad. She repeated this twice in an angry tone.\n\nFound out she's livid at me for being upset. I sent her a text today because I heard she didn't sleep well because of it. She hasn't replied.\n\nTL;DR: Mom cut the tie in half I got from my best friend's wedding (as the best man) without asking and without remorse. Now she's pissed at me for being angry with her.\n\nAITA?\n\nAlso sorry for the long af post \ud83d\ude05", "created_utc": 1669098864, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1mkb2/aita_my_mom_cut_my_tie_in_half_to_use_as_a/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She destroyed something that did not belong to her, and she should have asked you before she took it upon herself to use it for her luggage tag!  She owes you an apology and a new tie would be nice, as well.  \n\nLuggage tags are pretty easy to come by, so no excuses for her behavior!", "NTA.  Does she often do stuff along these lines?  If so she's got big issues.\n\nOr is it a passive aggressive way of telling you to get your stuff out of her house.\n\nRegardless, you need to get your stuff out of there or expect more to be destroyed.

And I'd be considering how much time you spend with them!", "NTA for being upset and what she did was absolutely wrong, but why would you leave something that special and small at their place? I get you have a small apartment and not much storage but... it's a tie. You could've framed it and put it on the wall for 'storage'.

But if the item is so important, why did you leave it at her house for 3 years?  You\u2019re a grown ass man, so clear your shit out of your parents\u2019 house and rent a storage room.  It\u2019s obvious that your snarky mom has had enough of looking at other people\u2019s belongings in her house, and doing other people\u2019s shopping.  Take a hint.", "NTA, some mothers seem to think they can do whatever they want with their son\u2019s belongings. My Son in law still had a bit of childhood gear at his mothers like card books, which were worth money, she knew this and deliberately gave them away as she couldn\u2019t control her married son anymore.

She stole from you and destroyed your property.", "NTA, you should cut all your family photos in half.", "ESH. Though I'm curious to know where the tie was. If it was carefully packed away like a cherished momento, I find it hard to believe she would have dug for it just to cut it up. Was it somewhere accessible or in plain sight? She may have thought it was just a tie for a wedding that you didn't like enough to wear again, especially if it's such a bold design. Or maybe she didn't even remember the wedding and just saw a tie you hadn't worn in years?\n\nTHAT BEING SAID she shouldn't have cut up something she knew was yours without asking. That obviously makes her the A H. \n\nYou put yourself in A H territory by the way you handled the situation, blowing up and swearing at her in public. You both sound equally petty. Also,  you're 34.
