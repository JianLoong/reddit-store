If he can't find a way to balance going out and having fun while still being up on time- he needs to figure his shit out! I don't see why he can't swing by the after party and be home reasonably to get up in time. \n\nI agree with others- you take your ass home and get good sleep- this is on him. If he is angry or resistant about this, that would be concerning to me. But I don't see why he can't do both.", "NTA. He's being stupid. I'd say we agreed to go to this appointment way before we went out tonight. If he keeps being pushy about it then let him go by himself and you go home and go without him. I'm sure you would be upset though and probably want him there though. You need your rest.", "NTA. Of course not. This is not the person you want to have a baby with.
