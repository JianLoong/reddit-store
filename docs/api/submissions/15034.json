I don\u2019t have kids and we don\u2019t have kids together. Fianc\u00e9 has an older child who lives across the country who probably won\u2019t be able to attend. The wedding will be around 60 people and we\u2019re paying per head ourselves for the whole event. Most of our friends are adults who don\u2019t have young children so we\u2019re having the wedding on a Friday and a late night reception with open bar.\n\nI asked for a child free wedding because my fianc\u00e9 (a combat veteran of 20+ years) is struggling with his CPTSD. He is in active treatment and on medication. His main trigger revolves around some specific incidents involving babies and children that I promise nobody wants to know the details of. He can\u2019t be near screaming or crying children without it causing him to start shaking and sending him into a panic attack. \n\nWhen this happens, I have to step in and allow him to leave the situation so he can try to calm down and it effects the rest of our day. I asked for a child free reception on the invitations assuming this would be enough. Everyone has been very respectful and made arrangements for kids to be watched during the wedding or sent regards if they can\u2019t attend without them. \n\nThis past week we stopped at FIL house in another state. It became apparent that stepmom is renting a place big enough for all her grown kids to come with all their children and babies. All of the adults were absolutely invited but the children were not included on invitations or in the rsvp. I assumed if people couldn\u2019t come without their kids, they just wouldn\u2019t come. \n\nWe casually mentioned again that no children are coming from my side of the family, the groom\u2019s maternal side and our friends due to respect for our wishes. MIL then says to me she\u2019s renting a house for the whole family and the kids to come because she wants a \u201cfamily event\u201d and she thought she would just let all the kids go to the ceremony and then take them back to the house so the adults can do the reception. \n\nI was also told by other family members that last time MIL was watching a toddler for a child free wedding, she said the same thing but ended up bringing the toddler to the reception anyway.\n\nBoth FIL and MIL have seen first hand now how the panic attacks happen after an episode with the babies while we were visiting. I was still told they will be bringing them to our 15 min ceremony anyway. I just don\u2019t understand why babies and children need to attend a ceremony they won\u2019t remember when it could possibly ruin the entire day for the groom. \n\nAITA for thinking if they want to have \u201ca family event\u201d to get all the kids together a  introduce the babies, they should have a family reunion or something and not use our wedding, especially considering the circumstances?", "created_utc": 1681746186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pm20w/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_fianc\u00e9s_stepmom/", "score": 237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your fianc\u00e9 said No. call and repeat yourself and tell them they will be turned away. They were invited, their presence is not demanded. This isn\u2019t HER family event. It is YOUR wedding. Jfc the entitlement of some people!", "Can you email the parents directly and let them know the kids-free applies to the ceremony and reception? I wouldn't deal with step-MIL at all, go directly to the parents, and hopefully some drop out of coming as a bonus.", "Tell them the children are not invited, if she arrives with the children she will be turned away at the door. Find someone to be a bouncer or higher private security for the day. If she wants to make a scene, she can do it outside the hall, and it can be someone else's problem you are getting married. \n\nTell her in advance again that the children are not invited, and they will be turned away if they arrive with children, make it really clear, then follow through.", "Hire a combat vet or two, in uniform.", "Bouncer is 100% worth the money here.", "\\^\\^ 100% agree with this. \n\nBut I'd also add, this is your **fianc\u00e9's** stepmother, not yours. **He** needs to be the one to step up and shut down the nonsense. **He** needs to back you and enforce the \"no children\" boundary. This is **not** his stepmother's wedding - this day is for you & him.\n\nIf stepmother wants a \"family event\", let her schedule, plan & pay for that some other time, and not 'poach' off of your wedding.\n\nNTA", "No, \"Why do you hate your stepson so much that his mental health means less to you than having the kids at HIS wedding that you have no involvement in?\"", "And what children want to go to weddings?", "To your last point, that doesn't matter.  If one of the kids starts crying during the ceremony and triggers her fiance's PTSD, then the entire wedding is ruined and it will be the MILs fault.  MIL should definitely know that since it's her stepson with the PTSD but she's being a massive AH.", "I agree with this. Why is this even being debated by the OP?\n\nYou should be protecting your future husband. If you can't stand up for him on this, then really think about your future together. \n\nNow is the time to just say to FIL and MIL: No children at the ceremony and reception, period. Anyone who shows up at either with a child will be escorted out by security. The end.", "His child could absolutely come to the ceremony and stand next to him as he\u2019s older and knows not to scream around his dad, but he\u2019s in school at the time and lives across the country and we aren\u2019t sure if BM is going allow it. He would also be bored at the reception since there will be nobody else near his age so even if he is able to come, we were not planning on him staying at the reception and he would go play with the kids there not attending the wedding.", "Tbh I bet most vets I know would volunteer to do it if they\u2019re free.", "I would hire security and let them know that no one will be allowed into the venue with a kid.", "You need your fianc\u00e9 to say it as well. Since it directly affects him.", "Just uninvite her. Even without your fianc\u00e9\u2019s PTSD, she has no business inviting anyone to someone else\u2019s social event. \n\nEchoing the advice to hire security. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about potential damage to your relationship with this woman going forward. She\u2019s nuked that with her behaviour. And frankly FIL can take a running jump too for not trying to talk her out of this scheme or warning you what she was planning. So can the family members brining uninvited children to a wedding. MIL may have assured them it was fine, but they all, every one of them, should have contacted you both to clarify the situation if there was doubt.\n\nI hope you have a happy marriage after a lovely wedding. Without any selfish a h\u2019s in sight.", "My sister has a phrase that might help you.  She tells people, \"Don't worry.  I can repeat the word 'no' as many times as it takes for you to accept it.\". This is a no child wedding and reception.

I'm so sorry if I didn't make that clear enough in the invitation.\"  \"You'll need come up with some sort of childcare plan as we aren't going to be able to make any exceptions whatsoever.\"   Keep practicing firm, but kind, variations of NO means NO.    If she still insists mention that the groomsmen and ushers have been instructed to escort anyone with children from the venue.  \n\nIf you have the contact info for her kids contact them directly and explain that there aren't going to be any children at the ceremony or reception and that their mom seems to be confused about that.  \n\nI hope you have a wonderful wedding.", "I would also let all those grown children know personally that kids will not be allowed. They may be told that they are an exception since they are \"family.\"", "I\u2019d consider reiterating that your wedding will be child free, but that as stepmom is so keen on a family reunion that she\u2019s welcome to host a Saturday brunch at which she can get the family photos she is likely wanting. \n\n\nAnd since you\u2019re already in contact with everyone, you\u2019ve put together an email with her contact info for everyone to rsvp to once she provides all the details of her event. \n\n\nIt really is a shame you\u2019ll be hungover/honeymooning/getting your face painted at the zoo or whatever that day, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll understand.", "Beautifully succinct", "I mean my overall point is the invite said reception only is childfree and most comments I\u2019ve seen have been talking about kids at the reception which was never in play.
