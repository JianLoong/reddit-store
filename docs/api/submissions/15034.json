I don\u2019t have kids and we don\u2019t have kids together. Fianc\u00e9 has an older child who lives across the country who probably won\u2019t be able to attend. The wedding will be around 60 people and we\u2019re paying per head ourselves for the whole event. Most of our friends are adults who don\u2019t have young children so we\u2019re having the wedding on a Friday and a late night reception with open bar.\n\nI asked for a child free wedding because my fianc\u00e9 (a combat veteran of 20+ years) is struggling with his CPTSD. He is in active treatment and on medication. His main trigger revolves around some specific incidents involving babies and children that I promise nobody wants to know the details of. He can\u2019t be near screaming or crying children without it causing him to start shaking and sending him into a panic attack. \n\nWhen this happens, I have to step in and allow him to leave the situation so he can try to calm down and it effects the rest of our day. I asked for a child free reception on the invitations assuming this would be enough. Everyone has been very respectful and made arrangements for kids to be watched during the wedding or sent regards if they can\u2019t attend without them. \n\nThis past week we stopped at FIL house in another state. It became apparent that stepmom is renting a place big enough for all her grown kids to come with all their children and babies. All of the adults were absolutely invited but the children were not included on invitations or in the rsvp. I assumed if people couldn\u2019t come without their kids, they just wouldn\u2019t come. \n\nWe casually mentioned again that no children are coming from my side of the family, the groom\u2019s maternal side and our friends due to respect for our wishes. MIL then says to me she\u2019s renting a house for the whole family and the kids to come because she wants a \u201cfamily event\u201d and she thought she would just let all the kids go to the ceremony and then take them back to the house so the adults can do the reception. \n\nI was also told by other family members that last time MIL was watching a toddler for a child free wedding, she said the same thing but ended up bringing the toddler to the reception anyway.\n\nBoth FIL and MIL have seen first hand now how the panic attacks happen after an episode with the babies while we were visiting. I was still told they will be bringing them to our 15 min ceremony anyway. I just don\u2019t understand why babies and children need to attend a ceremony they won\u2019t remember when it could possibly ruin the entire day for the groom. \n\nAITA for thinking if they want to have \u201ca family event\u201d to get all the kids together a  introduce the babies, they should have a family reunion or something and not use our wedding, especially considering the circumstances?", "created_utc": 1681746186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pm20w/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_fianc\u00e9s_stepmom/", "score": 871, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But keep a few more things in mind. If you allow your aunt to ruin the wedding for him he might start associating the wedding with the trauma. Imagine a future where your husband hates talking about or even looking at photos of your wedding. A future where you inadvertently started your marriage by letting your husband get trampled on by your family because you didn\u2019t stick up for him. A future where if these things happen you\u2019re going to have to reconcile the fact that it happened *because* you allowed it. \n\nNot trying to be all gloom and doom here but I really hope for your future husband\u2019s sake you do what\u2019s right. \n\nDon\u2019t give in to a compromise or you\u2019re just letting it happen anyway.

If it's in the budget, you could even offer to hire a childcare provider through a vetted service to watch the kids at the house MIL is renting", "I didn't say she had to. That's why I asked.  But it's clear this issue has been a problem with extended family before, and it sounds like it's going to be tricky to prevent a recurrence.\n\nShe's looking for a solution. Maybe she can afford it. Maybe people bringing children will chip in some dough if she finds someone to do the job.", "Oh, I love this so much.", "Yes since this is his step mother.

You would think she would be more sensitive to what her son is going through. It seems like she\u2019s doing this whether you want her to or not \u2013 I would consider trying to find a couple of babysitters to watch the kids so that you can insist that they stay at the house for the ceremony and reception. You are right to insist on this ceremony and reception being child free since your soon to be husband is still in treatment and still having panic attacks. Best wishes to you both for a happy healthy marriage.", "NTA. Hire security, to turn away people bringing kid.", "NTA and oh that just hurts my heart for your soon-to-be spouse. I believe you when you say we do not want to know the details.

You poorly communicated when you wrote child-free reception on the invitation instead of child-free wedding. So stepMIL understandably initially thought she could bring the kids to the ceremony and leave them in the rental home at the reception. But she was wrong to push once you told her that no kids can come in general. And your fianc\u00e9 needs to handle his family.", "INFO: did you say child free wedding or only child free reception?   Your post states both.", "I truly don\u2019t understand, how is MIL not able to respect this request for the sake of her own son?

Personally, I\u2019d elope if I were the two of you.

Your partners stepmom is a self centred grade a fuck wit. It\u2019s painful reading this as a person with CPTSD, tho to a far lesser extent, its god awful. It\u2019s like a mental slap you feel with your whole body that just rips you out of reality and slams you violently into somewhere you never wanted to be again. \n\nShe is a vile woman", "NTA. First I think you should not be required to have kids at your wedding if you dont want them. Then there's the reason you don't want them. Stepmom sounds like an awful fucking person for intending to have babies there despite knowing why you don't want them.\nDisinvite her imo and anybody with a baby gets refused entey", "NTA, but MIL/stepmom is.  Who gives a shit if *she* wants it to be a family event?? It's YOUR wedding. Just flat out tell her, if she shows up with all those kids, she'll be refused entry and escorted out.

Tell your ILs that anyone with kids will be turned away. Reach out to her kids and reiterate that the wedding is childfree. Hire a bouncer. It's time to be proactive.", "I agree!

If she wants a family event she can fund it herself \n\nDefinitely NTA", "Suggest not apologizing.\n\nMaybe, \u201cTo make things perfectly clear, this is a child free wedding to accommodate the groom\u2019s PTSD as it relates to children.  No children allowed at the ceremony, reception, or any pre or post wedding gathering.  Note that there are no exceptions and security will enforce the removal of children.  The groom\u2019s health is paramount and we appreciate your support.", "Not more firm. Absolutely, loudly, aggressively explicitly clear.

Which I assume, since your fianc\u00e9 is triggered by crying children, he doesn't know the children very well.", "NTA. This is not up for negotiation. Your fianc\u00e9 has CPTSD triggered by children. If he gets triggered, it's not going to be healthy for him or any of the kids in attendance. Tell MIL no kids, no exceptions.
