I don\u2019t have kids and we don\u2019t have kids together. Fianc\u00e9 has an older child who lives across the country who probably won\u2019t be able to attend. The wedding will be around 60 people and we\u2019re paying per head ourselves for the whole event. Most of our friends are adults who don\u2019t have young children so we\u2019re having the wedding on a Friday and a late night reception with open bar.\n\nI asked for a child free wedding because my fianc\u00e9 (a combat veteran of 20+ years) is struggling with his CPTSD. He is in active treatment and on medication. His main trigger revolves around some specific incidents involving babies and children that I promise nobody wants to know the details of. He can\u2019t be near screaming or crying children without it causing him to start shaking and sending him into a panic attack. \n\nWhen this happens, I have to step in and allow him to leave the situation so he can try to calm down and it effects the rest of our day. I asked for a child free reception on the invitations assuming this would be enough. Everyone has been very respectful and made arrangements for kids to be watched during the wedding or sent regards if they can\u2019t attend without them. \n\nThis past week we stopped at FIL house in another state. It became apparent that stepmom is renting a place big enough for all her grown kids to come with all their children and babies. All of the adults were absolutely invited but the children were not included on invitations or in the rsvp. I assumed if people couldn\u2019t come without their kids, they just wouldn\u2019t come. \n\nWe casually mentioned again that no children are coming from my side of the family, the groom\u2019s maternal side and our friends due to respect for our wishes. MIL then says to me she\u2019s renting a house for the whole family and the kids to come because she wants a \u201cfamily event\u201d and she thought she would just let all the kids go to the ceremony and then take them back to the house so the adults can do the reception. \n\nI was also told by other family members that last time MIL was watching a toddler for a child free wedding, she said the same thing but ended up bringing the toddler to the reception anyway.\n\nBoth FIL and MIL have seen first hand now how the panic attacks happen after an episode with the babies while we were visiting. I was still told they will be bringing them to our 15 min ceremony anyway. I just don\u2019t understand why babies and children need to attend a ceremony they won\u2019t remember when it could possibly ruin the entire day for the groom. \n\nAITA for thinking if they want to have \u201ca family event\u201d to get all the kids together a  introduce the babies, they should have a family reunion or something and not use our wedding, especially considering the circumstances?", "created_utc": 1681746186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pm20w/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_fianc\u00e9s_stepmom/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why didn't you? And also, why would you think that people would know that \"the reception\" secretly means \"the reception and also the ceremony\" ???? \n\nYour MIL is being kind of pushy here, but you were the one who sent out the invites, and you were the one who specified which parts of the wedding would be child-free, *and* you were the one who knew that you actually wanted the whole wedding to be child-free, rather than just one part. \n\nThis is 100% your fault."]}
