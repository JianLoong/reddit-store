We've had his housing assignment for a month and the summer orientation dates were getting pretty full (we waited on that because until we knew he got into the marching band it was still possible he'd change his mind).   All that to say, you've got a month at this point until most schools require you to have made a decision and paid your deposit at the least.  There's no waiting.", "NTA Open it as soon as you get it.
