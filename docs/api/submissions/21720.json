As long as they do, what they can to resolve their mistake, which may simply just be giving you your money back, they\u2019ve done what they can. \n\nLife will go on for you, and you will find something else to be excited for. Don\u2019t let this make you a cruel person. It\u2019s just uncalled for. You can be better.", "All you're doing is proving my point. \n\nYou're complete unwillingness to accept the likely ONLY POSSIBLE solution tells me you want to make the review video (probably for clout) as ANY REASONABLE person wouldn't be so hung up over a $70 jacket or an honest mistake that it ruined their entire life. \n\nYou clearly didn't come here to find out WIBTA. You came to get justification for what you know is a shitty response to an honest mistake and are arguing every point because it completely backfired on you.", "I\u2019m sorry for your predicament. Just try to forget about it for the rest of the weekend. I know. Easier said that done. \nThe amount of stress and energy that\u2019s consuming you on this isn\u2019t good. Go do something fun!!!", "You didn't have to say it, it was clearly inferred.", "Yes you\u2019re wrong.", "It\u2019s not their fault they ran out of stock. If it was a limited run, then don\u2019t blame them for not having stock. Also, I can guarantee you every business has screwed up an order before. It\u2019s not exclusive to this one. Amazon makes mistakes, people still use it. Your logic doesn\u2019t make sense", "Well you\u2019re fucking up now acting like a child over a messed up order, threatening bad reviews, already saying a refund is not enough. You got this damn package today so they\u2019ve had no time to respond. Grow the fuck up and get over yourself!", "They can\u2019t provide you with a product that\u2019s not in stock, they are not magicians, you are entitled to a refund, maybe a goodwill gesture, like a small discount at the very most. If their customer service assistant takes all the reasonable steps so you are not out of pocket then they remedied their mistake. You can be disappointed but they don\u2019t deserve to lose customers.", "....you expect a small business to have 24/7 customer service?", "....your correction is wrong dude. \n\nIt's you're.", "How long ago did this happen? And what was the business\u2019s response when you alerted them to the mistake?", "It\u2019s no different than telling my friends not to order from them because they\u2019re bad at keeping track of orders", "I realize that. Doesn\u2019t change the fact that that would mean they failed at their job and my review would reflect that", "I have literally no clue where tf to buy the jacket they embroidered on", "If they actually kept track well I\u2019d have my damn order. And obviously I\u2019ll be nicer when I talk to customer service even though I\u2019m pissed", "Every time I TRY to be excited about something this type of shit happens. I\u2019m not THIS mad because it\u2019s the first time. It\u2019s almost every damn time. I\u2019ll make plans and they\u2019ll fall through, I try to order something and it sells out within 3 minutes. I get outbid on a good deal for something I wanted on eBay. Almost every time I try to be happy about little things, SOMETHING goes wrong and I\u2019m beyond fed up with it", "They were selling the jacket. I bought the jacket. I didn\u2019t get the jacket. If I don\u2019t get the jacket, the company failed on their end. If the company does that, then I leave a bad review. That\u2019s how bad reviews work", "I\u2019ve got one day off before I work every day for 30 days and there\u2019s nothing going on tomorrow that\u2019ll cheer me up. I\u2019ve just accepted that tomorrow will suck. Either it sucks ass and I expected it, or it\u2019s average and I\u2019m pleasantly surprised", "You completely ignored everything but the first four words jfc. I don\u2019t think I am. It\u2019s. A. Hobby.", "I mean if a company does a shitty job, you leave a shitty review. I haven\u2019t even left a review yet. I\u2019m waiting for a response", "They should have some extras in case something like this happens. The thing that Nike and whatever has going for them is 99% of the time they can send you what you actually ordered. Doing limited drops and taking so long to ship them that everything is sold out and can\u2019t be replaced by the time you realize they screwed up is a shitty business model.\n\nEven a discount won\u2019t help because the jacket is OOS, the sweater I like is OOS (because I bought the jacket instead thinking I\u2019d actually get it). Their next drop is also an anime I don\u2019t like.", "Ah, my brain swapped the spots of the two forms of it since I\u2019m tired", "Ordered it a month ago and it said it would be 3-5 business days to ship it out (took 2.5ish weeks). I finally got it this morning and immediately emailed and haven\u2019t gotten a response yet", "You can only make that assertion if you repeatedly have problems ordering from them or you have a bad after sale experience. For all you know this is a one off you don\u2019t have enough evidence based on one order.", "A professional clothing maker would be able to help you with that. It\u2019s their job to create what you want if if they can\u2019t do it, they can usually refer you to someone who can.", "Mistakes happen. You need to drop this temper tantrum and pretend you\u2019re an adult capable of controlling their emotions. It\u2019s not actually a big deal, no matter how cool the jacket is. Get your money back, start shopping around for a different one or somebody else who can make it for you.", "But it\u2019s not the small business\u2019s fault that this is essentially the straw that\u2019s breaking the camels back. I totally understand that after so many things going wrong, this what pushes you over the edge, but again, blowing up a small business over an honest, human mistake is not the way to go.", "There's a difference between leaving a review with THEM so they can actually address a problem and making a TikTok for your followers that the company will likely never see. \n\nYou're clearly hellbent on doing this hoping to gain followers, as if you get your money back you lose NOTHING, but you're intentionally being inflexible for an excuse to make a scathing video that again they'll probably never see.", "Oy vey \ud83d\ude44\nGood luck with your endeavors", "Would have Should have could have you can\u2019t change what happened", "Ok wait and see what there responses is before giving them shit for it", "I\u2019d be more willing to try again if they would actually restock the goddamn thing instead of saying they\u2019re not restocking most of their old stuff and making a bunch of gaudy BS that I\u2019d never wear", "Are they even allowed to copy the design or no?", "If there was any jackets like it I wouldn\u2019t even be half as mad, but there\u2019s not. This is the only one like it", "Is it any different than telling my friends? No. If a company is shitty at getting you your stuff, you won\u2019t recommend them", "Yes, but that also means I have every right to leave a review about my experience buying from them", "I mean unless they magically have one more in my size, it\u2019ll be a refund at best which doesn\u2019t resolve the issue", "It depends. Some designers have no problem making an exact copy of someone else\u2019s design. Some feel it\u2019s unethical but they are willing to make something super similar with a few unique touches so it\u2019s still their own work. They\u2019ll let you know their preference upfront.", "Jfc. For $70 this is not a one of a kind jacket that is impossible to replicate. You\u2019re acting like a child with zero problem solving skills.", "Except you're not \"telling your friends\". You're making a public video to intentionally shame a small business that made a mistake and I firmly believe the only reason why is that you're hoping it'll gain you followers.\n\nI guarantee that almost every person has ordered something that has been disappointing or they didn't get what they ordered and I've NEVER seen someone make a video publicly try to shame them.\n\nA reasonable person would not only realize that mistakes happen, and accept the only solution possible, but also isn't so delusional to think that any video they would make would ever be seen by the company or frankly have any effect on their bottom line. \n\nWhich leads me back to the point that the only logical reason to make this video is because you want to gain followers. Nothing more, nothing less.", "I honestly dunno why u asked when you don\u2019t wanna hear anything other than what you want to hear do what you want", "Oh cool then where can I find it for $70? Because $70 was the sale price since it was the last one left."]}
