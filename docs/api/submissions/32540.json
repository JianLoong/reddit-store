If his staying would mean restricting your kids then it just can't be done, it sucks but it's not your fault", "You're NTA except for your phrasing in the title. You aren't refusing to take him in because he's probably autistic, you're refusing to take him in because you can't accommodate his needs and those of your kids/pets at the same time.", "NTA, your family comes first, you\u2019re not a motel.", "NTA.\n\nYour first priority is to your own children. If helping him would affect them negatively, you don't do it, period.  Like you said, for a few hours? Fine. A few days/weeks/months?  No. \n\nHonestly, the past incidents don't even factor in here - even if he had been welcoming and went out of his way to make it work for you to stay with him/your uncle, that would not be the same situation you're in now. That said, he knows first hand that sometimes moving family into the house just doesn't work for kids, he really ought to be able to understand that you made the same decision his father did years ago.\n\nHis attitude proves you made the right choice - you're an asshole for not helping family? Well he's trying to harm family by forcing himself into your house, what does that say about him?", "NTA, regardless of the reason your cousin can't deal with your lifestyle. He can't acclimate to your household, and you shouldn't be expected to make all the adjustments he would need to handle living there.", "NTA. Autism or not, adding another person to your household is always going to be a disruption. You are always entitled to decide who gets to stay in your house or not. I agree that your own family comes first. Why can't your cousin rent somewhere if he doesn't want to stay with the grandparents? It is not as if you are making him homeless.", "NTA. I grew up in a really small town/village and if you wanted to go to university you basically had to move somewhere else for grade 12 because our school wasn\u2019t post secondary focused. It was just too small so their main focus was just getting kids to graduate. \n\nBoth of my older brothers moved in with my cousins family in the city for their grade 12 year and maybe first year of university. \n\nWhen my time came they said no. They gave the excuse that because I was a girl I\u2019d influence my cousins (girls) and they weren\u2019t comfortable with that. I\u2019m on the spectrum \u2026 like Asperger\u2019s (not called that anymore) and so I can be awkward. The girls and I were close but whatever reasons they had, it felt really mean. I had to go with my oldest brother in a different city and it didn\u2019t go well. Probably one of the most traumatic things in my life. \n\nWhen I graduated I moved to the mountains and I was working at a resort they liked to come to. They\u2019d come vacation and wouldn\u2019t even tell me they were there. \n\nSo now, years later, now I\u2019ve graduated, I have 2 degrees and I\u2019m fine, they are more than welcoming. Please come visit. I never do. The bridge was burnt still  almost 15 years later. \n\nPeople make decisions and it has consequences.", "NTA. You need to place the happiness and well being of your immediate family before anyone else. It's not like he's homeless, just inconvenienced.

Those are valid reasons for your decision.  NTAH", "NTA you don't owe your cousin jack sh\\*t least of all after how he acted when you wanted to stay with your uncle.", "This isn\u2019t directly about his autism, and I think you do yourself a disservice by describing it that way.  This is about him requiring you completely upend the lives of your children and pets for an unknown but probably lengthy amount of time - at least months, until the divorce goes through and the assets are divided, but potentially much longer if he doesn\u2019t receive enough assets in the divorce to set up home for himself.  NTA, the accommodations he requires are just not possible for the length of time he would need them.", "NTA - it's your home, it's your call.. BUT I have to ask - did he say that your kids would have to be quiet or your dogs would have to be quiet? Because what the 12 year old autistic person needs and what the 37 year old needs might be very different... and are you assuming it will be negative when it might not be?", "YTA for ascribing this to his \u201cautism.\u201d Autistic people don\u2019t all act like this.", "YTA Let him move him but warm him first things normally are and aren't going to change.", "YTA for the amateur diagnosis and holding a grudge for over two decades. \n\nNo, you aren't obligated to take him in.  But you do owe him understanding and fairness.\n\nThere are many, many reasons why a 12 year old would have a problem seeing his parents take in a ten year old, and not adapt well.  Many of which simply come down to being twelve. Ten-year-old you was as disruptive to his routine, or more so, than him as a full adult will be to your  kids.\n\nThis isn't an all-or-nothing.  Talk to him as an adult.  Tell him that if he stays with your family, there are noisy dogs, and kids, and some chaos, and he'll have to live with that.  Maybe he he can split his time - with you on work nights, with grandparents the rest of the week.  Establish chores, rent, and a medium-term deadline for him to be out.\n\nMaybe an amicable compromise can be reached.  Maybe not.  Handle this as a mature adult, with communication, not a ten-year-old with a grudge.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s the cousin\u2019s specific needs that make them incompatible.", "No, I haven't. \"Autistic\" is not synonymous with \"cannot be accommodated in a house with kids or pets\", and phrasing matters when determining whether or not you're an asshole.", "I think you're NTA, but you've missed the point here. Your brother may or may not be autistic, but the specific traits that make him a bad guest are why you're not inviting him. Saying you're not inviting him because he's autistic is a bad way to put it, because you (presumably) wouldn't kick out everybody who is autistic but a fine houseguest.\n\nE: It is funny to imagine somebody kicking out a perfectly fine houseguest because like, they notice they have twenty tabs of British Railway history open though.", "True, but lots don't. Why drag them all into this? The problem is this person's behavior, not his autism.", "Oh I see, and that's reasonable if you're taking it literally, but I can't help but feel that OP is paraphrasing what cousin said?", "I don't know if you missed the part that cousin was also a child when all that happened, which is why I said it's irrelevant. OP was 10 and cousin was 12 and randomly had someone move into his home. I agree how he reacted at the time sucked but that's not an entirely abnormal reaction from a kid to having his home environment changed (OP doesn't give more details about what changes had to happen, but for example imagine cousin had to share his room with OP, you can see why he would be pissed), I think it was the responsibility of the parents to make both of them comfortable or at least more understanding of the circumstances. I would understand calling cousin an AH if the relationship was never repaired over the years and he randomly reached out to OP asking for a favaour, but from what OP says they've fixed the relationship enough that they even visit each other now and spend time together outside family gatherings. Hell, in fact, OP's reason for not accepting cousin into his home has nothing to do with what happened back then. NAH", "Yeah, I assumed OP is paraphrasing since the name of this sub is \"am I the **asshole**\" and no one wants to write out a conversation word for word. I think cousin just felt let down and let OP know, but OP did nothing wrong.", "It\u2019s context, but it could definitely have been phrased better.", "OP didn't use any direct quotes so it's all paraphrased. Paraphrasing doesn't mean OP is lying that their cousin called them an asshole.", "Oh i get that, i wasnt trying to start an argument, i wouldnt be able to put my pets away to make anyone comfortable. And im petty as hell so i would absolutely think of that reason regardless of how cool we were in present day settings. Even if it wasnt the actual reason for not letting them move in with me, it would still be in the back of my mind", "The title directly attacks his \"autism,\" but if he were clearly not autistic yet acted this exact same way, he also should not be offered lodging."]}
