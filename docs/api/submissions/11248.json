The plan was for us to stay (not for free!) for a few months while we looked for a place. However, we quickly found out my parents were in a major financial bind and were at risk of losing their house. We all agreed that we would stay for a couple years and split bills 50/50, allowing them to catch up and us to save for a down payment to buy a home instead of renting. \n\nMy husband and I fronted about $2500 to catch all the bills up. We gave my mom a set amount monthly towards bills. Multiple times, we would find out that the bills were not paid and things were about to be shut off, and have to pay large sums to keep things like the electric and water on because my mom didn't have the money. \n\nFast forward to now, my parents have divorced. My mom left my dad (55M) with the house, which he wanted, and my brother (32M) moved in. When this happened, my husband and I took over all the bills except the mortgage, which results in roughly a 45/55 split, with us paying 55% of the bills. My dad doesnt work and hasn't for about 7 years since he was laid off, because he claims he is disabled. He has a hard time getting around and is in a lot of pain most days. He has tried to get disability assistance from the government and keeps getting denied. My brother works full time, but choses a lower paying job because \"it's easy and he has a too much of a temper for anything else\" (his words, not mine). \n\nWell, my husband and I are done. We want our own space that we control. I must say it has not been a peaceful five years. My dad wants complete control of everything in the shared living spaces, and it always has to be his way. He doesn't respect us as equals. We also want to have children in a few years, and I cannot (or will not, anyways) raise children living in a basement.\n\nThe reality is that my brother cannot afford this house alone. They are consistently broke now, paying less than half. When I move out, I expect that utilities will decrease some, but not entirely of course. I will essentially be leaving my brother and my dad in poverty. My dad makes comments all the time about how no one will \"help\" him; but people have been for years and the reality is with inflation people can't afford to finance them. He often asks me to buy him things he wants for sale online or to buy him takeout food. He's not very appreciative and thinks because I am his child I owe him the things I have. He guilt trips me when I say no. My brother is perfectly fine sharing finances with him but I'm not. I want my own life and my own family. \n\nWe are planning on moving in November or December. To be clear, we are moving. I am beyond over this living arrangement and I think my husband would grow to resent me if I asked him to stay any longer (rightfully so, IMO).
