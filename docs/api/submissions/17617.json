Women must always do whatever we can to stay safe. She doesn't know you. It doesn't matter if you are cute and charming, and know you wouldn't hurt a woman. She doesn't know that.

I don\u2019t really understand why you said no. What if you noticed a birthmark on her neck that for some weird reason made you feel queasy and decided that she wasn\u2019t for you. Would it have been ok to leave her? What if you got home and it started getting hot and heavy and you decided you weren\u2019t ready to go further would that be ok? Just trying to think where lines are drawn. And the line I come by is that it is fine for her to ask and fine for you to say no as long as you accept the consequences. She said no ride with you without the picture of ID. You said no, means no ride. You accepted that. She stuck to her guns and that was it.\n\nI do want to go back to one part.
