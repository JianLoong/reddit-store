I don't like getting info like that second hand.  Not to mention that mom and my other son hadn't seen him.  \n      Part of it was selfish.  Part of it was sheer terror. All of it was true. \n      Without going into details,  my oldest son's father was a danger to him so I fought and won a complete termination of parental rights.  I'm the next of kin and speaking to my ex was a violation of HIPPA. \n       I pulled my ex aside and told him that I didn't appreciate his speaking to the doctors because much is lost in translation.

And none of you should be judged when you\u2019re in a high stress and emotional state and environment. \n\nWhat you are all going through is terrible, but what you are doing to each other and your son is also terrible. \n\nYou\u2019re treating your ex like he\u2019s a monster, yet you said yourself that he\u2019s the only man that stepped up to the plate to be your sons father. And he stayed your sons father even after you separated, and he stayed your sons father even after he found a new relationship. Do you have any idea how rare that is? How special your boy is? How great of a father and man your ex is to your son? What you said to him was beyond cruel and heartless, and you most likely hurt him very badly - and your sons heart would shatter if he heard you. What\u2019s worse is that everything you said is in *writing* and can be saved to be read again. \n\nYour ex should have sent his wife out of the room to retrieve you the second the doctor came in.

I think you should inform the hospital that your ex isn't your son's biological father, and you are no longer in a relationship. You're right; he isn't entitled to know your son's medical info. The doctors should speak to *you*, not your ex - or they should talk to you together if you'd be happy with that arrangement.\n\nA biological link doesn't make a parent. Your ex *is* your son's dad, and nothing can change the love he must have for your son. I'm sure your son loves him, too; as you said, your ex is the only father figure he's known. However, as your son's biological mother, I think you should ultimately decide when your ex and his wife can see your son. Your ex should be working with you to provide the best support and care for your son, not selfishly brushing you aside to do as he pleases.\n\nYour ex's wife hanging up the phone on you is incredibly rude, and your ex ignoring your request to text you because he \"forgot\" sounds like bs.", "ESH the hospital and who hit your son is where you anger should have been directed.
