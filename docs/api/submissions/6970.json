How great of a father and man your ex is to your son? What you said to him was beyond cruel and heartless, and you most likely hurt him very badly - and your sons heart would shatter if he heard you.

I think you should inform the hospital that your ex isn't your son's biological father, and you are no longer in a relationship. You're right; he isn't entitled to know your son's medical info. The doctors should speak to *you*, not your ex - or they should talk to you together if you'd be happy with that arrangement.\n\nA biological link doesn't make a parent. Your ex *is* your son's dad, and nothing can change the love he must have for your son. I'm sure your son loves him, too; as you said, your ex is the only father figure he's known. However, as your son's biological mother, I think you should ultimately decide when your ex and his wife can see your son. Your ex should be working with you to provide the best support and care for your son, not selfishly brushing you aside to do as he pleases.\n\nYour ex's wife hanging up the phone on you is incredibly rude, and your ex ignoring your request to text you because he \"forgot\" sounds like bs.", "ESH the hospital and who hit your son is where you anger should have been directed.

I hope your son is better soon.", "He was there because she invited him", "This isn't true, and I'm not even sure where to start with it. If you're saying that there is some violation for talking with family regarding the son's medical condition (and again, the step-father is family), the answer is \"no.\" The HIPAA Privacy Rule is nowhere near that expansive, and it's reasonable for a health care provider to believe that the son's father (even if not biological) is someone the son would not object to.\n\nThe bigger point, though, is that in many states, being a biological relation is not a prerequisite to having parental rights, particularly if, as OP said, this is someone who is the only father the son has ever known. In many states, that father acted in loco parentis and would be entitled, in a custody proceeding, to some level of custody or visitation.\n\nAre you trying to say that the mother has more of a right to make medical decisions for the son than the step-father?

You need to edit and make it extremely clear that you're talking about the stepdad. \n\nYou can't blame your son being an adult and going back to his abuser when you yourself invite them over for Christmas and football.

Where are you getting that claim about in loco parentis?!\n\nAnd morally: she called him there. She's the reason he was at the hospital. He wasn't \"keeping OP away from her own son,\" and as she said in the OP, \"\\*\\*As soon as my son was able, he told us what he wanted. I then shut my mouth and did as I was told.\" In other words: he wanted him there!", "Being at the hospital isn't the issue, though. Anyone can visit someone in the hospital if they have permission. Talking to the kid's doctors about his private medical information and possibly trying to make medical decisions for him is the issue, and he was not acting \"in loco parentis.\" The kid is a legal adult, so in loco parentis does not apply. Even if he were a child, in loco parentis would still not apply because the parent was present and didn't authorize him to act in her stead. Where did you get your law degree?\n\nMy daughter views my partner (her stepmom) as just as much her mom as I am, but that does not confer the right to make medical decisions for my daughter in *any* jurisdiction...and this guy isn't even a current stepparent!
