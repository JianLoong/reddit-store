Why do people think white people can't handle spicy/hot food? I live in Louisiana and we spice EVERYTHING up here, as hot as possible.

I think you were being extremely considerate to go out of your way to make two versions of the dish to make sure people will enjoy your food. \n\nI raise and process my own ducks and for a recent potluck made two dishes, one with my duck and one with beef so that people who were uncertain about home raised meat would be able to have some. It took extra time and a bit of extra money to double the ingredients, but everyone was happy. It's about knowing the group you are feeding and making appropriate accommodations.", "NTA and your dad was just kidding by calling it \"white people food,\" even us whities know what is meant by that. Incredibly considerate of you, my gf just brings extra crema when she thinks a dish she's made might be too spicy for some ppl.", "NTA.  It's not just the flavor - too much hot sauce can make you violently shit yourself if you don't have the digestion for it.  Besides, who doesn't love having options?  Guests can even 50-50 the two dishes to get their preferred level of spicy.\n\nSo long as you're not labelling the mild dish something like \"soft food for soft baby version, you vanilla softserve weaklings\" I'd say you're fine.", "NTA. Racism is part of a power structure. You were not being racist, not even prejudiced. You recognized from experience that many white people are unused to spicy-hot seasoning and often don't like the stronger flavor of goat. I'd say you are considerate, and at extra cost to you in money and time to make two dishes .You've said nothing offensive.", "NTA- I'm white and I'd appreciate a mild version of whatever delicious thing you're making. I can do a little spice but I'm definitely not used to it.", "It's not racist at all to make a less spicy version of a dish. Some people don't like so much heat that they turn red and sweat.

I said yes, but it doesn\u2019t show because of my skin tone.", "This is what bothers you? Not people stereotyping white people as people who can\u2019t tolerate spicy food, as if your skin color decides the level of hot you like your food to be?", "Also from Minnesota. Worked at an Asian restaurant and have had people come in and complain about orange chicken being too spicy before...  \n\n\nThen there's me, cutting up a bunch of Thai chili peppers to add to my food because it's not hot enough.", "this whole thread is so embarrassing. I'd have to order \"white girl extra-mild\" \ud83d\ude13\n\nbut weirdly my mum *loves* spicy food & used to get authentic Indian while pregnant with me. same story as other comments, had to prove to the restaurant that she could handle the spice before they gave her the good stuff. then the wait staff would watch a heavily pregnant German-Australian woman devour a rogan josh. \n\nand I came out with zero spice tolerance. I can't even do sweet chilli sauce.\n\nbut my brother loves spice!! can do even hotter than my mum. but his twin sister hated spice even more than me.", "I always order \u201cwhite people medium\u201d at my favourite Thai restaurant when they ask how spicy.", "For me (zone 5--frost dates 28th May and 25th Sept) I cannot produce any decent amount of spicy peppers (or any variety except banana peppers, really) without grow lights. My production has doubled since I started using heat pads under the seedlings. That doesn't just take planning, that takes money, and dedication to a setup that even my grandparents probably didn't have time for, considering they could far more easily just grow potatoes instead. \n\nI can see why a culture would be slow to adapt something that tastes unpleasant to them, especially when even two generations ago, it took quite a bit more than \"some planning\" and they didn't have the internet to figure out how to actually grow the thing.", "THEY. DO. NOT.\n\n:)", "I once went to a Thai restaurant with friends, and I wanted something kind of mild, so I got basil pork.  Since it was Thai, I should have realized that the peppers came without saying.  It was delicious, but I was sorry a few hours later.  I can't imagine why we have spice receptors around our anus - it's a little late for our bodies to be worrying about it.", "Same. And it\u2019s getting worse as I get older. I grew up eating Peruvian food. Aj\u00ed amarillo (equivalent to serranos or cayenne) gets added to almost everything. Rocoto (equivalent to habaneros) is used as well. I love it. But I sure pay the price afterward.", "weirdly I enjoy the burn down there just as much as in my mouth.  It's like enjoying the capascum twice lol", "That's \\*adorable\\* and I love how the servers keep checking in!", "Maybe he has rosacea? I just got diagnosed after a lifetime of turning bright red. Got a facial cream and now only go pink. Don\u2019t have his ability to down spicy food though", "omg, your story got me laughing so hard. hahaha, wow.", "Some people are actually allergic to capsaicin. You can just tell yourself it's an allergy?\n\nBut realistically, even people that grew up in those areas can't all handle the heat. Some of it is genetic."]}
