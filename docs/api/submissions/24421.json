Not being able to handle spice has nothing to do with race or skin color. Your dad and your sister are being racist.", "NTA, i guess your dad might be. Kinda hard to gauge his intonation in text.

Some  banter shouldn't be too much of a problem though.\n\n\nThe idea of people who are actually offended in this sub is hilarious to me btw.", "NTA - seems like you want people to enjoy their food, and you're taking into consideration that not everyone has been exposed to the same spice palate.\n\nIt's no different than when I \"cook\" something for someone other than myself. I know the flavours I like and how much spice I can handle. I know other people can't or don't want to match me scoville for scoville. my partner for example struggles with a jalape\u00f1o on pizza. I can comfortably go up to scotch bonnet and will occasionally throw a dash of Caroline reaper sauce on my pizza if I'm really wanting to burn.", "I'm confused. Why do people think white people can't handle spicy/hot food? I live in Louisiana and we spice EVERYTHING up here, as hot as possible. Is this a northern region thing??  \n\n\nNTA, I think you were trying to be considerate, but also I can get why people might be offended.", "NTA. \n\nI am Indigenous-Hispanic, and we have some spicy food. When I am with people who are not used to spicy food, I tone down the spices. \n\nIt's not racist.

If only foods could be labelled as \"suitable for white people\" as they are for vegetarians because that would be a real help for me.", "NTA. It's wonderful that you are willing to be considerate.  Personally, I love spicy food, but there are days that my ancient American bowels simply cannot handle the heat, so I can only take a bite or two. I would love a \"white people's version\" on days like that.   To be able to enjoy the flavors, but not have to suffer the consequences.", "NTA. I think you were being extremely considerate to go out of your way to make two versions of the dish to make sure people will enjoy your food. \n\nI raise and process my own ducks and for a recent potluck made two dishes, one with my duck and one with beef so that people who were uncertain about home raised meat would be able to have some. It took extra time and a bit of extra money to double the ingredients, but everyone was happy. It's about knowing the group you are feeding and making appropriate accommodations.", "NTA and your dad was just kidding by calling it \"white people food,\" even us whities know what is meant by that. Incredibly considerate of you, my gf just brings extra crema when she thinks a dish she's made might be too spicy for some ppl.", "NTA.  It's not just the flavor - too much hot sauce can make you violently shit yourself if you don't have the digestion for it.  Besides, who doesn't love having options?  Guests can even 50-50 the two dishes to get their preferred level of spicy.\n\nSo long as you're not labelling the mild dish something like \"soft food for soft baby version, you vanilla softserve weaklings\" I'd say you're fine.", "NTA. Racism is part of a power structure. You were not being racist, not even prejudiced. You recognized from experience that many white people are unused to spicy-hot seasoning and often don't like the stronger flavor of goat. I'd say you are considerate, and at extra cost to you in money and time to make two dishes .You've said nothing offensive.", "NTA- I'm white and I'd appreciate a mild version of whatever delicious thing you're making. I can do a little spice but I'm definitely not used to it.", "It's not racist at all to make a less spicy version of a dish. Some people don't like so much heat that they turn red and sweat.
