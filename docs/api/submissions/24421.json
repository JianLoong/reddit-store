I can comfortably go up to scotch bonnet and will occasionally throw a dash of Caroline reaper sauce on my pizza if I'm really wanting to burn.", "I'm confused. Why do people think white people can't handle spicy/hot food? I live in Louisiana and we spice EVERYTHING up here, as hot as possible. Is this a northern region thing??  \n\n\nNTA, I think you were trying to be considerate, but also I can get why people might be offended.", "NTA. \n\nI am Indigenous-Hispanic, and we have some spicy food. When I am with people who are not used to spicy food, I tone down the spices. \n\nIt's not racist.

If only foods could be labelled as \"suitable for white people\" as they are for vegetarians because that would be a real help for me.", "NTA. It's wonderful that you are willing to be considerate.  Personally, I love spicy food, but there are days that my ancient American bowels simply cannot handle the heat, so I can only take a bite or two. I would love a \"white people's version\" on days like that.   To be able to enjoy the flavors, but not have to suffer the consequences.", "NTA. I think you were being extremely considerate to go out of your way to make two versions of the dish to make sure people will enjoy your food. \n\nI raise and process my own ducks and for a recent potluck made two dishes, one with my duck and one with beef so that people who were uncertain about home raised meat would be able to have some. It took extra time and a bit of extra money to double the ingredients, but everyone was happy. It's about knowing the group you are feeding and making appropriate accommodations.", "NTA and your dad was just kidding by calling it \"white people food,\" even us whities know what is meant by that. Incredibly considerate of you, my gf just brings extra crema when she thinks a dish she's made might be too spicy for some ppl.", "NTA.  It's not just the flavor - too much hot sauce can make you violently shit yourself if you don't have the digestion for it.  Besides, who doesn't love having options?  Guests can even 50-50 the two dishes to get their preferred level of spicy.\n\nSo long as you're not labelling the mild dish something like \"soft food for soft baby version, you vanilla softserve weaklings\" I'd say you're fine.", "NTA. Racism is part of a power structure. You were not being racist, not even prejudiced. You recognized from experience that many white people are unused to spicy-hot seasoning and often don't like the stronger flavor of goat. I'd say you are considerate, and at extra cost to you in money and time to make two dishes .You've said nothing offensive.", "NTA- I'm white and I'd appreciate a mild version of whatever delicious thing you're making. I can do a little spice but I'm definitely not used to it.", "It's not racist at all to make a less spicy version of a dish. Some people don't like so much heat that they turn red and sweat.

In high humidity the sweat doesn't evaporate.\n\nAnd you need to stay hydrated too, if you stop sweating because there's nothing left to sweat that's very bad.", "You need proof that sweat helps keep you cool? Hot food - spicy or literally hot in the case of tea - makes you sweat more than the ambient temperature would on its own, and the sweat cools you down with evaporative cooling.", " But have it prepared by someone who knows how to cook it and  be open-minded. The first time I tried horse meat, I didn't like it at all, and not only because I was figuring the horse. The second time, that it was cooked differently, it was good.  This was in Italy, where they eat horse meat. It was explained to me that these are horses raised for their meat.", "Around here (SoCal) birria is often made from goat meat. Delicious, if perhaps a bit gamier than other meat.", "Ethiopian restaurants are good for it, too.", "I\u2019m in Phx, and you definitely can! There are some great Indian places that serve amazing goat dishes.", "Sorry for what you\u2019ve gone through mage, I know in lots of places this still happens but it\u2019s not the majority it\u2019s just the loud voices", "Awesome, enjoy!", "\u201cI\u2019m from the UK\u201d does not have the weight you think it does when talking about familiarity with spicy food.", "Lol", "By drowning it in some tongue deadening flavor of the month?", "WELL. Depends where you are \u2026 boston/area has some amazing restaurants. Then you have a million generic places that are essentially an applebees with no flair and no seasoning.", "Yeah, her father. Not her.\n\nOP simply made two dishes - one spicy and one milder - and left it up to the people eating it to decide what they wanted to try. That's not forcing racialised food on people; it's offering a variety.", "It doesn't stand though, that's the point. Your example changed the food entirely vs changing the ingredients slightly but still ending with the same meal. It seems victim complex is strong in you", "HA!", "Any recommendations? I\u2019m up near arrowhead mall.", "I feel sorry for you. I hope that someday you get the help you need.", "It depends on the cut and quality of the meat. A dry aged filet only needs some salt, pepper and a little garlic. A churrasco on the other hand is tough and needs to be marinated to be good. Marinating it in lime based chimichurri overnight will help tenderize it and make it melt in your mouth. Same for anything else. No, I don\u2019t just dump whatever sauce I find on it.", "I know the place. They have that weird spongy Greek pizza and something involving mild Buffalo chicken.", "Sorry. What did she call the bland dish?\n\nI thought she referred to it by race....", "I\u2019m not as familiar with that specific area, so places I know might be a drive for you. Indian Delhi Palace on McDowell offers goat in many dishes; I enjoy both the biryani and vindaloo. Khazana Indian Bistro in Scottsdale (little pricey, but good) has a whole lamb/goat section on their menu. There have to be places closer, but I\u2019m way the other side of town. If you find yourself out on the east side though, I\u2019d recommend either spot.", "If you're feeling super adventurous,Lee's supermarket and H- Mart also sell goat and other alternative meats including rabbit.", "Same to you, bless", "Okay so you know what youre talking about.", "Aaaand that's how we know you're racist.", "I love that this sub thread has led to sharing great restaurants for goat dishes! Never been to Phoenix but highly recommend vindaloo and biryani wherever you can get some good stuff! Yum! Think I might have to order dinner now!", "I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m up for cooking any of that yet, but I do love the H mart.", "Of course you do.  But a celt dising another celt isn't racist.  It's tradition.", "Yes! They\u2019re two of our go-to dishes at a new place. There was a little spot near us that had the most amazing biryani I\u2019ve ever tasted, but their quality took a sudden and saddening nosedive."]}
