I would have to stay with her for minimum three hours as the appointment is almost one hour drive from the house.\n\nHe straight away told me that he will never again ask me to look after her and that I always have problems with it. I told him that I love my niece and I don't have a problem with looking after her, but with him demanding that I look after her and not even asking me. In the past he would bring her by without telling me and would leave. \n\nHe told me that I am never looking after her when I am with her because I'm always on my phone. He walked on me once when I was staying with her for 10 minutes so he could help our Dad and she was drawing, so i answered a work email. \n\nI responded that I never am on my phone with her, unless I have to text someone and it's like a minute and she is in that age that she will ask to watch some YouTube videos, but after 10 minutes she stops. He told me that he will remember that and that i am an asshole because I just don't want to stay with her and just told him a cheap excuse and now he will have to take his sick child with him when his wife attends her appointment.\n\nI do feel bad, but I want another opinion. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702557929, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18i7utm/aita_for_refusing_to_look_after_my_niece/", "score": 547, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My brother has a daughter (f,4) and she is currently sick. I mean fever, cough, blocked nose etc. He told me today that I will look after her when he takes his wife so she can do her eyelashes.  I refused. I told him that I can't because I have a surgery in 9 days and I have to be healthy and I am getting sick quite easily. I would have to stay with her for minimum three hours as the appointment is almost one hour drive from the house.\n\nHe straight away told me that he will never again ask me to look after her and that I always have problems with it. I told him that I love my niece and I don't have a problem with looking after her, but with him demanding that I look after her and not even asking me. In the past he would bring her by without telling me and would leave. \n\nHe told me that I am never looking after her when I am with her because I'm always on my phone. He walked on me once when I was staying with her for 10 minutes so he could help our Dad and she was drawing, so i answered a work email. \n\nI responded that I never am on my phone with her, unless I have to text someone and it's like a minute and she is in that age that she will ask to watch some YouTube videos, but after 10 minutes she stops. He told me that he will remember that and that i am an asshole because I just don't want to stay with her and just told him a cheap excuse and now he will have to take his sick child with him when his wife attends her appointment.\n\nI do feel bad, but I want another opinion. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And for someone else's *eyelash appointment, loll\n\nHonestly, that's what got to me. Both parents are leaving their sick kid. That's 4 years old, and I's very dependent on them. \nSo the wife can drive an hour away and have her lashes done? \nGive me a break. I could understand a life or death situation. But lashes? She can find a way to go there herself, and OP\"s brother can take care of his kid. Or she can reschedule the appointment. \n\nOP has an operation they need to be all healthy for. \nShows how little the brother cares.

He can certainly ask, but he's insane if he has any expectation of being able to foist the child on OP without her agreement, and especially so if it's short notice.\n\nAnd it's triply so if the child is ill and quadruply so if OP has a medical reason to need to stay healthy.", "OP\u2019s niece is FOUR, not fourteen.", "Fucking eyelash appointment?

It's also possible the brother is horribly controlling and won't let her go on her own.  Of course, if she's simply demanding company for this while their kid is ill, that's almost as problematic as the brother insisting OP take care of their sick kid.\n\nOP is certainly NTA, and would be even if they didn't have an upcoming surgery.
