He lives with us both with rent at a discounted rate of 550, (our rent is 2900) he works part time and we encouraged him to save his money for emergencies thus he has spent his extra money on video games, remote controls and food. \n\nA week ago, my brother\u2019s girlfriend was 9 months pregnant and since they\u2019d split, they\u2019ve been living apart. On the day she was giving birth and her water broke, my brother asked if I could give him a ride to the hospital so he could be there for his daughter\u2019s birth - I told him no since my girlfriend and I had a date set and I wasn\u2019t going to cancel the plans I had for her that day. She was already dressed up and the restaurant I was taking her to was high-end. \n\nWe don\u2019t have much family where we live outside of our aunt who lives 2 hours away and our mom who lives in another state. He has asked me to give him rides before, particularly to doctors appointments but I always refused because I told him if he\u2019s having a kid, he\u2019s not a kid and he should start carrying his adult responsibilities. He was distraught and started calling our aunt who told him she couldn\u2019t help due to distance and he then called the hospital and ambulance, asking for transportation even though I told him that would be impossible for them to do so. He then tried calling an Uber and Lyft, but the hospital is 45 minutes away and we live in the city, so prices were steep. He began pacing back and forth through the halls and begged me to cashapp him $40 so we could go \u201chalf\u201d on his Uber fare, and said he\u2019d pay me back when he got his next check, I declined.\n\nHe then insisted that he ride along with my girlfriend and I, since the restaurant we were going to was in the same direction as the hospital, I refused again and explained to him that the hospital was 20 minutes further than our restaurant and that we would miss our reservation if we did so - and reminded him that this is not our responsibility. He became frantic and frustrated at once and started sobbing explaining that her pregnancy was high risk and that she didn\u2019t have any \u201creal family\u201d outside of her grandmother who couldn\u2019t be there for the birth due to health issues to my understanding. He explained that she was in the \u201chospital in labor alone\u201d which I find hard to believe, but still, I stood my ground and told him we couldn\u2019t help. \n\nHe stormed to his room and told my girlfriend and I that he hated us both. I could hear him in his room crying before we headed out. While on our date, he sent a lengthy message telling me how much he hated me. I explained if he doesn\u2019t like his living situation, he can move. This was a week ago and I feel as though he has been avoiding me. He hasn\u2019t spoken to me except to ask for a ride to work and back. His responses are usually short now and he is very distant. I can understand where he is coming from, but this was genuinely not our responsibility.", "created_utc": 1668477144, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvjgbz/aita_for_making_my_brother_miss_the_birth_of_his/", "score": 1134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Big time.\n\nI get the sense that you find your brother irresponsible and that you were trying to prove a point to him.  But holy hell - this was not the time to do it.", "YTA. He could've ridden with you to the restaurant and Ubered the rest of the way to the hospital at a cheaper rate... \n\nit may not have been your responsibility, but you could've realized the weight of the situation and offered to help a *little* bit. He is paying you rent after all, it's not like he's completely mooching off of you.", "Yta, think that's pretty obvious", "The lack of empathy for your brother or niece is disgusting YTA and I know that you know that", "YTA\n\nYou punished a woman in labor to get back at your brother. Should he get his life together? Absolutely, but what you did was beyond heartless.", "Wow dude, YTA. A date trumps the birth of your brother's child?  That is breathtaking selfishness. \n\nI get that he has been irresponsible, but this was not the moment to choose to teach him a lesson.  This was literally a once-in-a-lifetime moment.", "YTA.\n\nI hope he gets it together and cut you off. You\u2019re a terrible brother and you\u2019re going to need him one day.

First of all, you should\u2019ve canceled the date and taken him, full stop. There are times to teach someone responsibility and make them sweat out their circumstance, but the birth of their child is not one. This was extremely cruel. And to double down when he begged you for $40\u2026..you\u2019re a total and complete ass. He\u2019s 19. He will grow up and get more mature but he will never forget the circumstance under which his child was born.", "Just remember this specific situation when you need him to do you a favor.

I genuinely am sitting here trying to process what the fuck I just read and I genuinely can't understand how two people can be such HUMONGOUS assholes. Your brother is a teenager, and he tried everything in his power to witness the birth of his daughter and you refused to help. That poor girl had a child alone and you didn't have compassion for her?\n\nYou're an ass, your girlfriend's an ass, I do hope you both never need help for literally anything ever BUT if you do, I hope that you're treated with the same humanity, compassion and care you showed your brother.", "YTA. The least you could have done was let him ride with you to the restaurant and he could get an Uber from there that would be cheaper.\n\nYou just didn't want to be inconvenienced.\n\nETA - Did you eat and sleep well knowing that you prevented your little brother from a once in a lifetime moment? Did your meal settle fine in your stomach knowing you probably irreversibly damaged your relationship with your brother? Hope your meal was worth stealing this experience from your brother.", "While I understand not wanting to help your brother out (he shouldn't be wasting his money like you said he is), you should at least have some compassion for the poor woman going through birth w/o support.

You could\u2019ve dropped him off at the restaurant you were going to so he could take an uber and be cheaper for him!!! YTA", "YTA. You can go on date night whenever. He can only be a first time dad once. He gave alternative offers and you still denied him. You gave 0 give and had 0 empathy. You were being overly cruel. You couldn\u2019t leave for dinner early or at least drop him off near the restaurant so he can get a cheaper Uber ride? Congrats on ruining your relationship with your brother.", "YTA really you couldn\u2019t even lend him $40 or take him to the restaurant so he could be closer to the hospital and get a cheaper Uber?

You are absolutely am asshole. Seriously? A date over your niece/nephew? Sounds like your gf us an asshole as well for not insisting to drop off ur brother", "YTA\n\nHe's a Dad.  He needed to get to the hospital to support the mother of his child and you stole a one time experience and may have hurt the relationship between him and his child's mother, who he does need to coparent with, for a date.  Would it have really killed you to go a few minutes out of your way and drop him at the hospital?  It was in the same direction.", "YTA. Hope you never need a liver or something, I'd tell you it was your responsibility to have a healthy organ and just let you suffer.", "YTA. You can have a date anytime. A birth only happens once and he had to miss his daughter's because your head is completely shoved up your ass. Better hope that you don't need him for something in the future. As he's gonna remember this for life and make you pay for it one day when you're the one in trouble.", "YTA. You could've at least let him ride with you half way, and/or loan him like $40 or so for the Uber fare for the rest of the trip. It's his child's birth.", "YTA \nHe's your brother and you were about to be a uncle. His child is now part of your extended family. Yes he needs to grow and take responsibility for his life. You put one date night out as way more important than something HE WILL NEVER GET BACK!", "YIKES. YTA. Are you going to explain to YOUR NIECE OR NEPHEW that their father could have been at their birth but you have a pride complex about your brother? This was bigger than you. This is about the baby and it\u2019s mother needing support. You failed them both.", "YTA. Your priorities are definitely f@cked up, and your sanctimoniousness about what you\u2019re doing just makes it worse.", "YTA to the max. I find it hard to believe this is real. Idk how someone could be such an ass", "YTA. Your niece was being born, dinner can wait.", "YTA.  Big AH\n\nI understand that you are trying to make him more responsible and that\u2019s a great thing to do. \n\nBut you can start after the cord is cut.  \n\nHow were the appetizers?  Good, because your nephew was crowing. \n\nMain course?  Delicious?  Glad it was, because the mother of your nephew was pushing and in a lot of pain.  She could of used his support. \n\nDessert better have been good, because your brother didn\u2019t get to hold his baby. \n\nAnd those are moments he would never get back.  You can always have more cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nF@ck, you are such a big AH that you said they don\u2019t have family.  Not only should you have cancelled your reservations to drive you should have been in the waiting room for him. \n\nBut don\u2019t worry, it will make a good story in therapy some day.", "Cruel AF. Ultra YTA.", "YTA. This has to be fake. No one could possiblity be this much of a selfish AH, could they?", "YTA wtf is wrong with you?!", "There is a time and place for lessons to be taught.

You can't tell the difference because you're obviously an AH. \n\nHe will never forgive you and you deserve it.", "This is so clearly YTA that I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s even real. This was not the time to teach your brother a lesson.", "YTA. A date can happen anytime. The birth of your child happens only once.", "What a silly question. Of course YTA. Reread what you wrote; it\u2019s blindingly obvious.", "Uhm. YTA. you could have dropped him off and still went on a date. It was the birth of his CHILD and he wanted to be there. Are you jealous or toxic ? I don\u2019t get why you wouldn\u2019t be supportive of your brother being a good dad.", "Yta", "YTA. Geez. This is just a gross story of madness and meanness.", "I am really having a hard time believing this story is true, but on the off chance it is, you handled that situation entirely wrong and, you sir, are the asshole.\n\nYTA", "YTA you should\u2019ve given him a ride to the restaurant and he could\u2019ve at least uber from there", "YTA, this wasn\u2019t some menial event worth teaching him a lesson over, it was the BIRTH OF HIS CHILD! He will never get a chance to fix this, it\u2019s not like rearranging a doctors appointment (or a date\u2026). You telling him to \u2018grow up\u2019 isn\u2019t gonna magically give him the skills to do so. \n\nI sure hope you don\u2019t need any urgent favours from him in the future, god forbid your car breaks down at the birth of your child and he\u2019s the only one available. He will remember this forever, and probably resent you for it. Was your little lesson worth burning that relationship?", "YTA. You refused to let your brother ride in the car to go to the birth of his child. The birth of your nephew. It wasn\u2019t like he was asking for a ride to the store. \n\nThis has to be fake, because I refuse to believe someone this selfish exists.", "YTA - You are heartless. I hope your \u201chigh-end\u201d restaurant food was worth your relationship with your brother and his newly born child.\n\nMay all of your future restaurant orders burn.", "YTA nothing but the audacity\u2026. you think a date is more important than the birth of your niece or nephew, don\u2019t be surprised when he moves out and goes NC", "YTA - Was your brother wildly irresponsible in his behaviour and not making plans to be there for the birth prior to the day of? Absolutely. \n\nWas this the time to make this point if you intend to have any sort of positive relationship moving forward? No.", "YTA - A date can occur anytime, the birth of a child happens once for that child.  \n\n You could have been an asshole at any other time and picked the wrong time to be one.  I don't blame him for still being mad at you.", "YTA so selfish. What you did is unforgivable. You weren\u2019t there when your brother needed you the most. Would it have killed you to help him out? Really think about how you would feel if you missed the birth of your child.", "Wow you're a major ahole! Even if you couldn't bring him the whole way he could have at least drove a little and then maybe from that point an Uber. You deliberately made him miss the birth of his child. I hope to God you're never going to be in a situation like that because if they give you a taste of your own medicine then don't come crying here how they are the ahole.", "YTA, this was the birth of your niece or nephew, your family and you thought a dinner date was more important? You said that you have very little family and doing this will probably make you have even less family. Your brother is a 19 year old kid and no one has their sh** together when they are a teenager. You should\u2019ve done the mature thing and taken him to the hospital or at least within 20 mins of it. If you want so badly for your brother to grow up, then help him and instead of letting him drown. It really sounds like you may have some growing up to do yourself if you couldn\u2019t step up and help your brother. How cold does one have to be to not help their own brother be there for the birth of his child? I really won\u2019t be surprised if your brother eventually goes NC with you one day.", "Of course YTA. You clearly tried to prove a point by declining to take him to be present at the birth of his child. \n\nYes he\u2019s going to be a dad but he\u2019s also 19. It takes time to reconcile that in anyone\u2019s head. When I had my first child I couldn\u2019t believe I was responsible for them for the next 18 years. \n\nWho cares how high end the restaurant was, how dressed up your wife was or how irresponsible with money you think your brother is you should have taken him. \n\nOne day you\u2019re going to need him and as you said you don\u2019t have much family he\u2019s going to ignore you just like you did him when he really needed you.", "Yes. Yes you are. YTA. Without reservation. \n\nWhat's more important? Let me think...a dinner date, or MAKING SURE YOUR BROTHER WAS THERE FOR THE BIGGEST EVENT IN HIS LIFE since his own birth. \n\nYour obtuse selfishness is mind-blowing.", "Sorry, but you sound like a a fucking cnt, not just an AH. Listen to yourself and tell me how this isn't cruel and borderline sociopathic. This is the birth of his first child, and you're going on a date. Fuck out of here.", "YTA\n\nI get what you're saying, but an extra 20 minutes is nothing. I'd be surprised if you haven't permanently damaged your relationship with your brother.\n\nI'd be plotting some sort of revenge against you.", "YTA\n\nthere were so many ways you could have helped...you suck!", "I can't even fathom why you don't think YTA. You made him miss arguably the most important event of his life because you couldn't handle a small inconvenience. You could have at least fronted him part of the Uber fee so you could have been where you needed to be.\n\nAre you even concerned for your brother at all, or are you asking because you're wondering how you'll recoup his share of the rent once he moves out?", "Hard YTA!!! This was not the time to teach him responsibility. Don\u2019t expect to have a brother for much longer. You were already going in the direction of the hospital and you should have taken him. Honestly, what you did here was unforgivable.", "I know it must be a pain in the a$$ to have him asking you all the time for rides to the hospital to see his first child\u2019s birth \u2014 it must get old.  /s  YTA", "YTA. I hope your meal sucked as much as you do.\n\nThere are lessons that need to be learned, however that was not the time to teach them.", "YTA. Hopefully your brother saves up enough to never have to see you again. And don\u2019t you dare get in that child\u2019s life, then need humans with feelings.", "YTA. He\u2019s never gonna forgive you this.", "Yta. I hate when people have this tone, like they\u2019re the smarter person trying to teach someone they think is less smart a lesson about life and the way of the world. You had a lot of different options that would have made you not the asshole, and you chose none of those.", "Of course YTA, the bigger one of the day.", "YTA. I hope karma treats you similarly and when you need help desperately, you\u2019re also denied since it\u2019s \u201cyour responsibility\u201d", "YTA. I have no words. YTA.", "YTA and sound jealous and spiteful", "YTA. \n\nHow cold-hearted can someone be? At least your gf seems to be similar to you, so you both clearly deserve each other.\n\nLet's hope your brother will find another home soon and would kick your toxic ass out of his life forever. And if he burns down your home and leaving you homeless, you better not come to him asking for help. Your behaviour was absolutely disgusting, repulsive and vicious, I'm really happy I don't know you.", "YTA I understand wanting him to be responsible for himself, but this was just a cruelty. You were wrong and this is a moment your brother will never get back. It sounds like you were trying to get back at him because you dislike him.", "honestly flabbergasted about how selfish you and you\u2019re girlfriend are, BIG YTA", "YTA. I get where you are coming from. He created this baby and should have started stepping up since the moment he knew he would be a father. However the gf wasn\u2019t have a planned cesarean or being induced so they never knew when the baby was coming. You could have at least explained this to your gf and if she didn\u2019t want to drive to the hospital then you could have dropped him off at the restaurant and he could have gotten an Uber. Also remember that this baby is your family too and so far you are not a good uncle.", "YTA.  Here's hoping you never need a favor.", "holy shit, this is sad\u2026 your little brother who is a teenager is going through the biggest moment of his life and you\u2019re punishing him instead of showing him love? i would never do my little brother this way. he needs support from him BIG brother. unless he personally hurt you- family comes first and he deserves way better. YTA !!", "Ugh my god TYA- I can\u2019t even IMAGINE putting a date with my spouse/partner ahead of making sure my sibling gets to the BIRTH OF THEIR CHILD!!!!! I\u2019m actually angry right now.", "You and the other asshole are evil as fuck. YTA,  I hope Karma hit you hard and fast.", "I'm confused trying to understand the logic behind trying to force him to grow up and figure out how he can make it to witness the birth of his child on his own, but you continue to give him rides to work instead of forcing him to figure out a way to transport himself to work and continue to make his money. One situation was a once in a lifetime opportunity with several scenarios where you could have assisted without hindering your date plans. The other is a regularly scheduled thing where you can reclaim your time. I get the impression you don't like your brother much. This feels spiteful and malicious and no one deserves to be put in the situation you forced him into when he was trying to do the right thing and stand by the woman bringing his child into the world because he understood given the circumstances she was probably scared and alone and despite the fact that they are no longer together was doing his damndest to stand by her and welcome the miracle they created together. You are the king of AH and may you never experience the pain, panic, and torment you forced your brother to experience. Beyond despicable.", "The whole carrying adult responsibilities concept is great and all, but that's his first child. You couldn't have made an exception?

It\u2019s time you accepted that you cannot repair the damage you have caused to a mother, father, and to a child when it finds out his father missed his birth because his uncle behaved without basic compassion. YTA", "YTA. I think everyone else has done a good job explaining why.", "Dude. What the fuck? Of course YTA. Your priorities are wild.", "Yta", "You are not his dad, but you certainly are the asshole here. I get wanting to have him learn to grow up for his kid, but this is your niece. He missed her birth because you couldn\u2019t help him out because of a date? No, he didn\u2019t do things the way you wanted, and you felt the need to punish him. He\u2019s barely an adult himself and clearly hasn\u2019t had much guidance here. It sounds like all you and your girlfriend have some serious growing up to do as well.", "I don't understand how you could think you're not the asshole here? I mean, yeah, it wasn't your responsibility, but this is something you do for someone you care for. The way you write about this in such a callous way, too... Yikes. Your girlfriend was seriously ok with this?", "YTA. A date does not supercede the birth of a child. He is a kid, trying to figure things out. He wanted to start by being there for the birth of his child. But, nope, your appetizer couldn't wait for another time. You are a massive AH.", "YTA. Wow. Just\u2026wow. Side note, that child is also your family. Fun that your don\u2019t care about it either. \n\nOnce in a lifetime moment versus a nice dinner. Just wow.\n\nHope your girlfriend also saw how little you value family. It\u2019s a great indicator that you put yourself first.", "Jesus YTA. He's made some decisions that have some tough consequences but those don't have to include his own family punishing him with their superiority complex. Cruelly. \n \nThere is no other time, ever, when his baby will be born, when he can do his best to do right in that moment. To have his brother's support and joy for an irreplaceable moment and his efforts to be a man. \n\nBut you felt a \"high end\" dinner reservation was actually important. 'Though clearly what you value most is lording your dictatorship over this young man.\n\nYou may never come to regret this (your head being so far up your own sphincter no light will *ever* shine on it) but you can know he'll never forget it.

He lives with us both with rent at a discounted rate of 550, (our rent is 2900) he works part time and we encouraged him to save his money to save for emergencies thus he has spent his extra money on video games, remote controls and food. \n\nA week ago, my brother\u2019s girlfriend was 9 months pregnant and since they\u2019d split, they\u2019ve been living apart. On the day she was giving birth and her water broke, my brother asked if I could give him a ride to the hospital so he could be there for his daughter\u2019s birth - I told him no since my girlfriend and I had a date set and I wasn\u2019t going to cancel the plans I had for her that day. She was already dressed up and the restaurant I was taking her to was high-end. \n\nWe don\u2019t have much family where we live outside of our aunt who lives 2 hours away and our mom who lives in another state. He has asked me to give him rides before, particularly to doctors appointments but I always refused because I told him if he\u2019s having a kid, he\u2019s not a kid and he should start carrying his adult responsibilities. He was distraught and started calling our aunt who told him she couldn\u2019t help due to distance and he then called the hospital and ambulance, asking for transportation even though I told him that would be impossible for them to do so. He then tried calling an Uber and Lyft, but the hospital is 45 minutes away and we live in the city, so prices were steep. He began pacing back and forth through the halls and begged me to cashapp him $40 so we could go \u201chalf\u201d on his Uber fare, and said he\u2019d pay me back when he got his next check, I declined.\n\nHe then insisted that he ride along with my girlfriend and I, since the restaurant we were going to was in the same direction as the hospital, I refused again and explained to him that the hospital was 20 minutes further than our restaurant and that we would miss our reservation if we did so - and reminded him that this is not our responsibility. He became frantic and frustrated at once and started sobbing explaining that her pregnancy was high risk and that she didn\u2019t have any \u201creal family\u201d outside of her grandmother who couldn\u2019t be there for the birth due to health issues to my understanding. He explained that she was in the \u201chospital in labor alone\u201d which I find hard to believe, but still, I stood my ground and told him we can\u2019t help. \n\nHe stormed to his room and told my girlfriend and I that he hated us both. I could hear him in his room crying before we headed out. While on our date, he sent a lengthy message telling me how much he hated me. I explained if he doesn\u2019t like his living situation, he can move. This was a week ago and I feel as though he has been avoiding me. He hasn\u2019t spoken to me except to ask for a ride to work and back. His responses are usually short now and he is very distant. I can understand where he is coming from, but this was genuinely not our responsibility.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You've never driven him around before. The mother of his child is 9 months pregnant, so the birth did NOT come as a surprise. He KNEW it was going to happen sometime soon.\n\nIt's shitty to the mom, yes, and I do think your language surrounding her is very AH ish... like, you find it hard to believe she has no one else? Why? Do you think he's lying for sympathy? Some people genuinely do not have family. That is seriously uncool of you.\n\nBUT. This is still 100% on him. He KNEW this was going to happen. He should have had a game plan to get to the hospital when this happened, and you have never been available to him for this kind of thing.\n\nSometimes even to your own family you need to say \"No, you need to take responsibility and do this yourself.\" Sometimes that includes staying firm with your \"no\" even when they *really REALLY* need it, because he had the chance to plan, and he didn't.\n\nBut... both the woman and the baby are going to be alone in the hospital now.

For instance, you said the hospital was 20 minutes further than the restaurant. Why not let him come along with you that far, you go to your reservation as planned, and he can figure out Uber from there? It would be much cheaper for him, and not at all inconvenient for you.

To be clear OP didn\u2019t take anything away from his brother. He didn\u2019t forbid his brother from going to the hospital, he just told him to figure it out.

Maybe she does have family but the relationship has gone sour so it makes even more sense for your brother to need to be there, labor aside. And also, if something happened and the mother died during labor, your brother, who is already upset about missing the birth of his child, would be burdened with the knowledge that he wasn't there for her final moments.

OP sounds pretty fed up with the brother and neither of them seem to be thinking logically.", "Exactly this, or in a pinch you let the brother drop you at the restaurant and drive the 20 minutes to the hospital, he can let you know where it is parked, and when the date is over you take an Uber to go pick up the car at the hospital...maybe even getting to meet your niece too. Doubt he really considers the kid family though.", "That stuck out to me too. OP is cold.
