I heard the doorbell ring and assumed it was my girlfriend so I asked my mom to set the rice cooker for 45 minutes while I talked to them.

You were the cook, it was your meal for your guests, and it really sucks that your mom couldn't respect that.\n\nBeyond that though, COOKING SPINACH FOR 45 MINUTES???? She was the one setting the timer, she knew how long it would be in the cooker. Like, the dish being ruined was completely inevitable then. Wouldn't matter what else was in there with it, slimey, soggy spinach all over everything would've made anything inedible. Why would she throw in SPINACH of all vegetables for 45 minutes?? I'm not saying she genuinely did this or that I genuinely believe this was her intent, but it almost sounds like she was trying to sabotage you. Honestly, you should make her taste what she made. Hell, have her remake her own spontaneous recipe and serve it to guests. She might have an inkling of how bad she fucked up then.\n\nEdit to add: I always feel bad in those rare occasions I yell or curse at other people too, but when the other party refuses to listen or acknowledge that they messed up...... we're all only human, there's only so much of feeling disrespected a person can take.

Not one person besides him, ate a single flipping bite. Because no one wanted chili, corn, jalapeno cornbread.

Some moms need to be yelled at and screamed at in order for them to get it, otherwise they just simply don't. Sometimes kids even end up going no contact because their parents just wouldn't listen to them. As much as I don't advocate for yelling at people, some people just don't listen or hear you any other way, especially parents when it comes to their kids. Parents already rarely listen to their kids opinions and feelings, and view it as disrespect If the feelings and opinions don't align with theirs.

In that moment it wasn\u2019t about your mom helping you, it was about her need to feel right.

With a deep breath and a genuine desire to remain peaceful, coming up with a nice way to express your frustration would have been doable. \"Mom, I love you, and I know you're just looking out for my health, but it really hurt my feelings when you made that alteration to my rice.

Your mom needs to cool her jets and think about why she felt the need to step in/try to take over a meal you were very excited to cook for important people in your life. \n\nIf she thought you needed more veggies, what was wrong with her cooking the spinach in another pot (and teaching you how to cook spinach) instead of basically forcing everyone who wanted rice to have to eat the damned spinach, too?!?!?! I absolutely despise cooked spinach (and I'm not a teenager. I'm in my 60s!) and all of us get to choose what we eat except when we're little kids/our parents choose for us! At 15, you are no longer a little kid, and--note--your mother isn't your gf or her friend's mother EITHER... so where does she get off thinking she can somehow force everyone at the table to \"eat their veggies\" like that?!?!?\n\nNormally, I give parents a lot of grace in situations with their own kids .... and I guess she may have bought some of the food you were cooking, too, and therefore felt like she had the right to comment ... but that's still no excuse. Rice is cheap. And after raising my own offspring to adulthood (who have since given me grandkids and great-grandkids, too) ... I cannot for the life of me think of ANY REASON that justifies your mother changing your food behind your back/being so rude like that. \n\nHonestly, I would never cook for anyone else in her kitchen ever again, not if she's going to be that rude. Your GF has a kitchen at her house, right? And you can manage to gather up a couple of dollars to buy your own food to cook there, too, right? \n\nAnd maybe one day your mother will hopefully wonder why you and your friends suddenly started going somewhere else to hang out ... and avoiding her house like the plague! I hope it doesn't take that long, but your mother doesn't seem like she listens.", "NTA, she needs to respect boundaries and understand that no means no. Plus she obviously isn't educated on what a vegetable is, which is sad. The fact that she went behind your back is super disrespectful and to do this in front of your guests makes it even worse.

But keep that to yourself.\n\nOn to more important matters; I too fell in love with the restaurant industry when I was young and went to a specific high school for their culinary arts program\u2026.look to see if your school or a school nearby that you can get to has the ProStart program. It\u2019s a co-op program that lets you get highschool credit for working and my school gave me 3 credit hours a semester so I only had to go to school half a day as long as I had a job and my bosses did quarterly grading of my job performance. They also have kick ass culinary competitions on the state and national level and if you win you can win a free ride to an accredited bachelors in hospitality management to even the CIA and most definitely Johnson and wales. I paid for my first two years of college on culinary scholarships and had a lot of money I didn\u2019t use for other schools. They will also help you find a restaurant job and good quality mentorship. \n\nNext Las Vegas has more restaurants per capita than any other place in the world and has every kind of restaurant you could dream of working at. UNLV\u2019s hospitality management program is 3rd in the world. Also most the big restaurants have locations nation and world wide so you can always internally transfer. Restaurant hours in vegas for BOH is usually 2pm fine dining, but you have graveyard, morning, and evening. So you can work and go to school if you wanted. Start thinking about it now and also look online for scholarships for anything you can think of, there a a whole bunch just for writing an essay why kid is your fav peanut butter cause no one does cause they think they won\u2019t get the 500 but that\u2019s why you will and that stacks up fast. \n\nJust a lot of hopefully helpful things to get out of a crappy situation. \n\nAlso I work at a very fancy Japanese place at a hotel on the strip in vegas and you were very correct about the spinach. Also make sure to rinse your rice until the water runs clear before making in the rice cooker, that is a very important step.\n\nIf you have more questions please feel free to DM me", "NTA, you didn't do anything wrong at all.

Of course, don\u2019t go and disagree with/disobey her all the time because of this, but yelling and/or swearing while arguing with moms very often doesn\u2019t make the situation any better.\n   \n   I would first apologize for yelling and swearing, then try to explain exactly why what she did made you upset as calmly as you can (If you haven\u2019t already).

OP had spent hours cooking, was under pressure to deliver on expectations of great cookery, had planned out a menu and delivered on it. Then minute she yields a inch of control over situation by leaving the room, Mum steps in, decides what OP has delivered isn't good enough and, under pretence of doing good, wrecks the whole meal. I'd be furious too. If Mum had actually cared that this one night without vegetables would harm them all, then sweating some spinach in a pan would have been rude but acceptable. But no she had to diminish and interfere. OP handled it pretty maturely - she apologised to her guests, took blame for ruined rice on herself and blew up later.", "Unrelated as you are 100% right to be angry but mushrooms are not vegetables", "OP must be a better cook than mom", "Whoever said to add ketchup to anything should go to foodcourt and served for life.\n\nTheres tons of spices, lovely veggies, good meat, fish, etc. And we ruin the perfect flavor with storebought sauces that would survive a nuclear winter.", "Right???

Really? Never??? So.....please kind sir, please don't hurt me..should be spoken softly so not to be impolite to your mugger? People raise their voice to be heard! If you don't want someone to raise their voice to you, LISTEN to what they are saying! It is NOT OK to deny people autonomy. It is NOT OK to ignore what people tell you they need or want.
