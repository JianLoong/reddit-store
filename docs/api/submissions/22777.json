I will be having an adult discussion with my mom about what happened and apologize for my yelling and cursing. Thanks again for all the support!   \n\n\nSo I, (15m) Love to cook. In fact, I plan on making it my job one day, if possible. Tonight I was cooking for my girlfriend and her friends because she had been bragging about my cooking and they wanted to try it. I was making steamed garlic mushroom chicken and I was planning on trying a new recipe for rice that I had been tweaking, bamboo shoot and spring green onion rice, Japanese style. This particular rice has a very mild flavor, and any added ingredient could destroy it.\n\nWhile I was prepping the chicken, my Mom was complaining about the lack of vegetables in the meal. (apparently the mushrooms, onion, and bamboo wasn't enough) I ignored her suggestions of what to add to make it \"more healthy\" and finished prepping the chicken, put it into the cooker, and moved onto the rice. I cut the green onion and sliced up the bamboo shoots and threw it into the rice cooker. I heard the doorbell ring and assumed it was my girlfriend so I asked my mom to set the rice cooker for 45 minutes while I talked to them. I opened The door, said hello and led them to our living room, and told them dinner would be ready in 50 min. I checked on the rice cooker and it was set for the right time, so I figured everything was fine.\n\n45 minutes later, after I had got the chicken out to cool I opened the rice cooker to see there were slimy green leaves in it. Spinach. I tasted it, and it was ruined. fuck. I quickly packed it into a container and put it in the fridge. I went out and grabbed my guests and told them that unfortunately something went wrong with the rice so we would only have the chicken. Everyone ate, and after everyone had left, I got into an argument with my mom about the ruined rice in which she denied any wrongdoing and said she was only trying to help. I eventually yelled \"MOM, IT WAS MY F\\*ING RICE WHICH YOU RUINED, AND YOU DONT EVEN CARE!\" She has been giving me the cold shoulder ever since, and I feel bad for yelling at her.

You were the cook, it was your meal for your guests, and it really sucks that your mom couldn't respect that.\n\nBeyond that though, COOKING SPINACH FOR 45 MINUTES???? She was the one setting the timer, she knew how long it would be in the cooker. Like, the dish being ruined was completely inevitable then. Wouldn't matter what else was in there with it, slimey, soggy spinach all over everything would've made anything inedible. Why would she throw in SPINACH of all vegetables for 45 minutes?? I'm not saying she genuinely did this or that I genuinely believe this was her intent, but it almost sounds like she was trying to sabotage you. Honestly, you should make her taste what she made. Hell, have her remake her own spontaneous recipe and serve it to guests. She might have an inkling of how bad she fucked up then.\n\nEdit to add: I always feel bad in those rare occasions I yell or curse at other people too, but when the other party refuses to listen or acknowledge that they messed up...... we're all only human, there's only so much of feeling disrespected a person can take.

Mexican spices. Said it was gonna be so good. \n\nI told him he ruined it to which he said I was being dramatic. I baked his monster and left the kitchen. No one. Not one person besides him, ate a single flipping bite. Because no one wanted chili, corn, jalapeno cornbread. He cussed at us and said we're ungrateful for the food in his house. \n\nI never cooked for him again, even now 15 years later. I refuse to cook for him even if he's a guest. I'll make frozen meals or get take out. He's asked several times for family events to bring something and says \"bring something, like cornbread or biscuits\".

Some moms need to be yelled at and screamed at in order for them to get it, otherwise they just simply don't. Sometimes kids even end up going no contact because their parents just wouldn't listen to them. As much as I don't advocate for yelling at people, some people just don't listen or hear you any other way, especially parents when it comes to their kids. Parents already rarely listen to their kids opinions and feelings, and view it as disrespect If the feelings and opinions don't align with theirs. So if they're already going to view you as disrespectful, everything you do is going to be considered disrespectful, even if you're not actually doing so.

In that moment it wasn\u2019t about your mom helping you, it was about her need to feel right. You called her out and she is being pouty and ignoring you like she\u2019s immature and has no emotional control. Adults should have the self control to see other people\u2019s feelings, respond to them without ego, and especially have the emotional control not to make their own feelings someone else\u2019s problem. Anyone trying to downplay what happened as \u201eoh you shouldn\u2019t have yelled\u201c and focusing on that is missing the bigger picture. You tried explaining your side of it, your mom defended herself for absolutely no reason. That\u2019s childish and you\u2019re just a kid who is still learning and working on your own emotional control. If you feel like apologizing for yelling that is up to you, just don\u2019t apologize for being your own advocate and if she wants to be a pouty brat then that is what she does.

To be fair, I have no knowledge outside of the post itself so I can\u2019t say for certain, neither can you. We can likely agree, however, that after a certain period of feeling like you aren\u2019t being listened to, it is definitely natural for a CHILD to raise their voice in frustration.

I hate it when I'm making something using an authentic recipe, and someone tries to talk me into making Americanized alterations. I would be furious in your shoes.

With a deep breath and a genuine desire to remain peaceful, coming up with a nice way to express your frustration would have been doable. \"Mom, I love you, and I know you're just looking out for my health, but it really hurt my feelings when you made that alteration to my rice. That was an authentic Japanese recipe that I worked hard to learn how to cook properly, and I really wanted to show off to my friends just how far my skill has come.\"", "Lol you trippin.

I absolutely despise cooked spinach (and I'm not a teenager. I'm in my 60s!) and all of us get to choose what we eat except when we're little kids/our parents choose for us! At 15, you are no longer a little kid, and--note--your mother isn't your gf or her friend's mother EITHER... so where does she get off thinking she can somehow force everyone at the table to \"eat their veggies\" like that?!?!?\n\nNormally, I give parents a lot of grace in situations with their own kids .... and I guess she may have bought some of the food you were cooking, too, and therefore felt like she had the right to comment ... but that's still no excuse. Rice is cheap. And after raising my own offspring to adulthood (who have since given me grandkids and great-grandkids, too) ... I cannot for the life of me think of ANY REASON that justifies your mother changing your food behind your back/being so rude like that. \n\nHonestly, I would never cook for anyone else in her kitchen ever again, not if she's going to be that rude. Your GF has a kitchen at her house, right? And you can manage to gather up a couple of dollars to buy your own food to cook there, too, right? \n\nAnd maybe one day your mother will hopefully wonder why you and your friends suddenly started going somewhere else to hang out ... and avoiding her house like the plague! I hope it doesn't take that long, but your mother doesn't seem like she listens.", "NTA, she needs to respect boundaries and understand that no means no. Plus she obviously isn't educated on what a vegetable is, which is sad. The fact that she went behind your back is super disrespectful and to do this in front of your guests makes it even worse.

But keep that to yourself.\n\nOn to more important matters; I too fell in love with the restaurant industry when I was young and went to a specific high school for their culinary arts program\u2026.look to see if your school or a school nearby that you can get to has the ProStart program. It\u2019s a co-op program that lets you get highschool credit for working and my school gave me 3 credit hours a semester so I only had to go to school half a day as long as I had a job and my bosses did quarterly grading of my job performance. They also have kick ass culinary competitions on the state and national level and if you win you can win a free ride to an accredited bachelors in hospitality management to even the CIA and most definitely Johnson and wales. I paid for my first two years of college on culinary scholarships and had a lot of money I didn\u2019t use for other schools. They will also help you find a restaurant job and good quality mentorship. \n\nNext Las Vegas has more restaurants per capita than any other place in the world and has every kind of restaurant you could dream of working at. UNLV\u2019s hospitality management program is 3rd in the world. Also most the big restaurants have locations nation and world wide so you can always internally transfer. Restaurant hours in vegas for BOH is usually 2pm fine dining, but you have graveyard, morning, and evening. So you can work and go to school if you wanted. Start thinking about it now and also look online for scholarships for anything you can think of, there a a whole bunch just for writing an essay why kid is your fav peanut butter cause no one does cause they think they won\u2019t get the 500 but that\u2019s why you will and that stacks up fast. \n\nJust a lot of hopefully helpful things to get out of a crappy situation. \n\nAlso I work at a very fancy Japanese place at a hotel on the strip in vegas and you were very correct about the spinach. Also make sure to rinse your rice until the water runs clear before making in the rice cooker, that is a very important step.\n\nIf you have more questions please feel free to DM me", "NTA, you didn't do anything wrong at all.

Of course, don\u2019t go and disagree with/disobey her all the time because of this, but yelling and/or swearing while arguing with moms very often doesn\u2019t make the situation any better.\n   \n   I would first apologize for yelling and swearing, then try to explain exactly why what she did made you upset as calmly as you can (If you haven\u2019t already).

(Just like what she did to you. Like mother like daughter. Wink wink). She wanted some vegetables (different from what you had prepared) included in her meal. You could have accommodated her request by making a small batch of veggies she could have on the side of her meal. Or asked her to make a side dish. Including her might have probably stopped her from doing her own thing......maybe.\n\nAlso I agree with your mom with the lack of \"vegetables\" opinion. I'll explain as best as I can. There are different categories of vegetables and mushrooms are considered meat/protein substitute in some cases and in other cases treated as an herb/flavoring. (Another example of what I mean: Its like how corn, and some root crops are more so considered starch than veggies. Celery is treated more so like an herb/flavoring in most dishes.) Veggies like onion are grouped/categorized as herbs/flavoring in meals and aren't considered \"veggies\". Like if you have a steak smothered in onions and mushrooms...you would still need a veggie and a starch to go with it. To make it balanced. That's why a dinner might have steak(smothered in onions and mushroom) with a side of mash potatoes and steamed broccoli. That's a complete or full meal. (butter, cheese or other condiment on the  potatoes would fulfill the dairy requirement).\n\nI'm not familiar with bamboo shoots so I'm not sure how it's categorized and I don't care too strongly to Google it right now :-/ \nI'll just assume it's like a starchy vegetable you used to ac. Garlic, and green onion seem to serv as herbs/flavoring for the rice. So if you factoring this information your mom opinion of the meal was right... in a sense. Unless I'm wrong about bamboo being categorized as a starch. Your meal did lack \"veggies\" things that aren't starchy, herbs or could role play as a meat/protein substitute. I hope this all makes sense. I don't know how to explain this any better. \n\nThis is something taught to us when we are young girls by our mother/grand mother (cultural habbits) and I took home economics in high school and this was part of planning a balanced meal.

You would yell \u201cf*cking\u201d at your mom? Really? No excuse there.", "YTA-bc you yelled.  Your rice was not ruined.  It was different and probably fine.  You should of still served it bc spinach does not change the flavor of rice.  Then you have an adult conversation with your mom regarding your recipes.", "That is incorrect, spinach most definitely changes the flavor of rice this mild, but I understand the sentiment", "Him and his friends paid for the food.\n\nAnd he said the spinach ruined everything about the rice, he couldn\u2019t have fixed it", "So then, not the cornbread.", "Stop fighting back. Just ignore.", "I laughed at this, but you're right. Thank you for the judgement", "him and his friends paid for the ingredients. So not only did his mother ruin the meal, she wasted the money her and son, his GF, and his friends spent on the ingredients", "I've had rice and spinach dishes. You add the spinach at the very end - not at the very beginning!", "Yeah i am no cook by any means but i guess she isn't either. Most people aren't. And that isn't the main thing that makes you an AH\n\nEdit: i just thought It might be a cultural thing, where i am from we don't usually serve side dishes or they are not regarded as essential or nearly half as important as t'he main dish.", "Is your brother cooking them and adding ketchup to the cooking dish? Because dipping chicken nuggets in a kind of sauce and adding this (vinegar-based) sauce to the pot - there are two different things. At least your brother is using ketchup only to his own plate, not ruining the whole meal for everybody.   \nThe other thing - nobody is expecting a 7yo to be expert in cooking.", "i see, thanks for that info, I learned something new (I didn't know that before)", "oh, well now ik what stewing Chicken means (I had no idea before), also yeah I view it as weird because usually most people dip their chicken nuggets in BBQ or Honey (at least where I'm from), one time I did try Chicken nuggets in Ketchup though, I still prefer BBQ", "I love nuggets dipped in honey but I like ketchup and bbq too. My son (8yo) likes ketchup.", ">It was never about the cooking.\n\nYeap \"The Iranian yogurt is not the issue here!\"", "Lol that sounds like my sister. She loves the Instant Pot because it allows her to 'cook' without putting much effort out and keeps her from having to gasp wash dishes. She has a habit of burning pots and pans then leaving them on the counter/sink/stove for days. \n\nCompletely understand that kneejerk reaction. Have it whenever my sister shoves her phone in my face to look at her 'awesome new recipe hack!'"]}
