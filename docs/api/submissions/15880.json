(She dismissed herself of her parental duties during that time - especially if it was over one joint).\n\n- it seems like there are subjects that just aren't discussed, like the one above but also: what did the feeling of rejection during that time do with you, why were you such a shitty teen in the first place, how are the both of you actively gonna own up to the past and work on a full recovery of your bond (if it's something you both are interested in),.. \n\n- it sounds like (again: limited info) that you are still carrying that traumatic experience with you like an open wound. So I do recommend a way to bring nuance into that memory and find a way to accept that that is a chapter in your life, but not the whole book. Therapy can greatly help with this. \n\n\nSo in summary: you both were the asshole, and neither. This is a complex downward spiral situation, spanning over years so it's impossible to say. \n\n\nAnd anyone that has a clear cut answer to this situation is portraying a very black-white rendition of it, regard their feedback with caution.", "NTA. \u201cHey, that trauma I prescribed for you really paid off - look how resilient and independent you are now!\u201d I\u2019m sure parenting a self-admitted \u201cgenerally shitty tween\u201d isn\u2019t easy. But months-long rehab for one joint is an overreaction; and even if there had been more drug use, it was your parent\u2019s responsibility to pick a safe rehab. And barring that, to now apologize and acknowledge the harm they exposed you to.", "NTA.\n\nIf what you wrote is true and you shared 1 joint and then were sent away then that seems very extreme. Did they not try anything else first? Be honest, how much other trouble were you getting into? You do admit that you were \"a shitty tween\", so as terrible as it was maybe you aren't seeing how hard you were to raise at the time. Unfortunately some people think that cannabis use automatically sets you on a path to being a junkie, which is ridiculous. Overall I think you are NTA for calling out her attitude towards trauma that was created by her actions, but maybe there is more to it. Try having an honest conversation about what happened to you, maybe her perspective can change too.", "I mean...what did she say that was incorrect? You admit yourself you were a shitty tween, and you were smoking weed at *thirteen*. Even the most permissive weed folks generally agree that's *way* too fucking young.\n\nI'm not a fan of some of those scared straight programs myself, and I know the \"troubled teen\" industry in the US has a lot of problems. But you *did* see your future, didn't you?\n\nUnless you're leaving out a massive amount of detail, I feel like there's a YTA vote here.", "YTA - everyone is saying it was an extreme reaction to \u2018just smoking weed\u2019 but you said it yourself that wasn\u2019t all of it, you were a bad teen overall. Looking back at the people i grew up with in school who were like that and where they are now, its quite possible she did save you.\n\nSo many of my friends parents who took the softly softy approach ended up with loser kids.", "ESH imo. You weren't just smoking weed at 13, you had bad grades, problematic friends, and you fought with your parents. Now sending you to a 3 month rehab is an insane reaction, and on top of that she thinks she'd done you a favor, I don't blame you for not wanting a relationship with her. But calling her the c word instead of calling her out is not okay. We all get influenced by our parents somehow, don't let her be your bad influence. Walk away and live your live.", "Mild ESH \n\nI wanted to say not TA, but the way you \u201clost it\u201d at your mom and called her several names (inc c**t) was a tad OTT. I think there were perhaps calmer ways to have gotten your point across. Not at that exact moment maybe, but you could have said nothing, cooled down, and then approached a conversation from a levelheaded place. \n\nBUT\u2026 Rehab at *thirteen* for **one** joint\u2026 that\u2019s hugely AH territory. I get people who think scaring kids straight is the way to go, I just don\u2019t feel the same way about it. If my son had smoked weed at 13, you can bet your \ud83c\udf51 he would\u2019ve been grounded, everything taken away from him, etc. But I wouldn\u2019t shove him into rehab. It sounds like a traumatic experience. Hence why you\u2019re less of an AH than your mom, but kind of TA for losing your cool. It\u2019s always better to use your words and try to make your viewpoint. She won\u2019t listen to you screaming at her. But she *might* have listened if you\u2019d tried talking it over.", "More info needed, what country?\n\nAs a mum who just went through drug rehab, it wasn\u2019t \u2018just a shared joint at 13\u2019 to enable 3 months of rehab\n\nAs the mother of a 15 year old he was in rehab 200km from home for 15 weeks\n\nDid they take it way too far or did what they saw best at the time to give you the best outcome?\n\nYTA, look at your actions", "YTA. It sounds like you still have issues. Parents aren't perfect, but she did send you away to help you. You were on what she thought was a bad path. Maybe she chose badly, but she meant well. Calling her those awful names was an AH move. Why not talk to her about it? I think you need therapy. You have anger issues at the very least.", "I think NTA, but the optics would be better for you if you had communicated your feelings with composure.    \nTaking the information at face value, i.e. that it really was one joint, I'd say that you are doing well *in spite of* being put through that, not because of it. \n\nSomeone taking credit for your life successes, and attributing them to a trauma that they put you through at such a young age would rile up anybody.", "Who knows, maybe seeing how awful it was, it didn't tempt you to want to use hard drugs, which often happens. Don't be so quick to jump to conclusions, maybe she was at least partially right?", "She\u2019s not wrong though.", "[removed]", "NTA, this is madness and anyone who pretends this is ESH or YTA is writing their own fanfic.

I was sent to pupil referral units and Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services multiple times for behavioural issues as a tween and a teenager, never did any kind of drug though)** and sending your child to fucking rehab for one joint fearing they would become a drug abuser. The real kid who needs disciplining is the one who got the joint from their sister and the sister herself for giving her younger sibling a fucking joint.\n\nImagine being put through a hell of a time **(And I understand how much of a hell of a time rehab can be from having an ex-alcoholic ex-girlfriend who explained the entire process to me of rehab)** for a single joint. Scared straight programs are for children who are on the cusp of being a delinquent, OP was just arguing with his parents and having shitty grades.\n\nOP's reaction is justified because that would be horrific for a 13 year old to go through for something small to the point they were scared of making friends. There's going to be underlying issues from that.", "He smoked once and his description of being shitty was bad grades and fights with parents lol. Not sure that means he was on his way to become a junkie.", "he smoked once. god imagine how these people would react if he\u2019d had alcohol? would he have been sent to rehab? yeah he made a mistake but instead of educating him they sent him to a facility and traumatised them. they are lucky he even talks to them let alone spends hours with them at a time", "Dude, he was fucking 13 and it's clear they just to the nuclear option rather than trying anything else.", "Literally everything you said is call 'being a fucking teenager'.", "Dude, he said it was one joint, are you suggesting you know his situation better than he does?", "Sending your child to what amounts to prison at 13 over one joint would be pretty unforgivable. I think OP should ignore his therapist and stick to NC for a while. Mom clearly has no regrets, so let her be satisfied with herself by herself.", "I guess you haven't heard of the saying \"the path to hell is paved with good intentions\".", "This answer is horrible too. \n\nShe shouldn't have sent OP to rehab, just to some kind of behavioural therapy thing. Yes, she meant well but what she did is inexcusable for a single joint that wasn't even theirs. OP already has a therapist which shows you didn't even read the post properly. Imagine your parents congratulating you on going through something that you considered traumatic considering OP was in rehab when they're not even a drug abuser, I'm surprised they took OP in anyway for smoking a single joint.
