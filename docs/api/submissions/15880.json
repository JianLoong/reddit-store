(She dismissed herself of her parental duties during that time - especially if it was over one joint).\n\n- it seems like there are subjects that just aren't discussed, like the one above but also: what did the feeling of rejection during that time do with you, why were you such a shitty teen in the first place, how are the both of you actively gonna own up to the past and work on a full recovery of your bond (if it's something you both are interested in),.. \n\n- it sounds like (again: limited info) that you are still carrying that traumatic experience with you like an open wound. So I do recommend a way to bring nuance into that memory and find a way to accept that that is a chapter in your life, but not the whole book. Therapy can greatly help with this. \n\n\nSo in summary: you both were the asshole, and neither.

Unfortunately some people think that cannabis use automatically sets you on a path to being a junkie, which is ridiculous.

You weren't just smoking weed at 13, you had bad grades, problematic friends, and you fought with your parents. Now sending you to a 3 month rehab is an insane reaction, and on top of that she thinks she'd done you a favor, I don't blame you for not wanting a relationship with her.

NC is great, I'll give you that, but always make sure to do it so long as you have peace of mind about it. Minimal contact works too, but always make sure you are drawing your boundaries clearly (In which case you did) and tell the rest of the clan to step off because it's none of their business.

It didn't cause them. If you were smoking weed at 13 one must assume your life kind of sucked. Mine sure did. I was abused pretty badly by my family. \n\nUnless schizophrenia runs in your family like it does mine the worst case scenario for smoking dope so young is probably shitty grades and a lack of motivation. That's it... I don't have any evidence to support this final point but smoking so young led to me having a chemical dependence on it for many years. I've only recently been able to kick the habit. \n\nI was able to quit drinking/stop smoking cigarettes and many other drugs with very little problem but for me personally weed was the most addictive substance I ever took.

Everyone hates their parents when they turn 18. As you get older, you will see how difficult it is to keep yourself alive in addition to meeting all other societal expectations and keep your family fed for 20 years. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour parents were ignorant and should have done  more research before having children. But that is true for parents. At least you had parents who cared about you enough to intervene. Some parents just let their kids continue to make bad decisions and bury their head in the sand. If you were a parent to your 13 year old self, what would you have done to get through to yourselves that age? What could anyone have done or said to command your respect?

He never once mentioned that he told them how much it traumatized him but he did say that he changed, in their eyes, for the better because he was scared straight because of their actions.

She wasn't allowed to do anything as simple as going to the movies with friends when she got back, so she jumped at the chance to try a beer with some boys on her lunch break. When she was sexually assaulted by the boys, she was too scared to tell anyone what happened because she didn't want to get in trouble for the alcohol.   \n\n\nDealing with the assault and the enforced isolation by her family lead to a massive breakdown and a massive need for escape.
