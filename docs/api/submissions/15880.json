(She dismissed herself of her parental duties during that time - especially if it was over one joint).\n\n- it seems like there are subjects that just aren't discussed, like the one above but also: what did the feeling of rejection during that time do with you, why were you such a shitty teen in the first place, how are the both of you actively gonna own up to the past and work on a full recovery of your bond (if it's something you both are interested in),.. \n\n- it sounds like (again: limited info) that you are still carrying that traumatic experience with you like an open wound. So I do recommend a way to bring nuance into that memory and find a way to accept that that is a chapter in your life, but not the whole book. Therapy can greatly help with this. \n\n\nSo in summary: you both were the asshole, and neither.

NC is great, I'll give you that, but always make sure to do it so long as you have peace of mind about it. Minimal contact works too, but always make sure you are drawing your boundaries clearly (In which case you did) and tell the rest of the clan to step off because it's none of their business.

It didn't cause them. If you were smoking weed at 13 one must assume your life kind of sucked. Mine sure did. I was abused pretty badly by my family. \n\nUnless schizophrenia runs in your family like it does mine the worst case scenario for smoking dope so young is probably shitty grades and a lack of motivation. That's it... I don't have any evidence to support this final point but smoking so young led to me having a chemical dependence on it for many years. I've only recently been able to kick the habit. \n\nI was able to quit drinking/stop smoking cigarettes and many other drugs with very little problem but for me personally weed was the most addictive substance I ever took. People will say it's non habit forming and non addictive but I am living proof that in rare circumstances that is not the case.", "Going against the grain but No idiots here. \n\nYou admitted yourself you were a tough teen to deal with.

Everyone hates their parents when they turn 18. As you get older, you will see how difficult it is to keep yourself alive in addition to meeting all other societal expectations and keep your family fed for 20 years. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour parents were ignorant and should have done  more research before having children. But that is true for parents. At least you had parents who cared about you enough to intervene. Some parents just let their kids continue to make bad decisions and bury their head in the sand. If you were a parent to your 13 year old self, what would you have done to get through to yourselves that age? What could anyone have done or said to command your respect?

He never once mentioned that he told them how much it traumatized him but he did say that he changed, in their eyes, for the better because he was scared straight because of their actions.

While I was at the facility, I did everything I could to make those boys lives a little lighter: I was so empathetic to the fact that these kids were away from everything they knew-friends, family-and that I didn\u2019t realize until I was 35 that the way I used substances was problematic.

That\u2019s a recipe for trauma. \n\nWe had kids make alcohol. They were constantly sneaking cigarettes. There were times that weed was in the house\u2026 probably pills.

Keep repairing your relationship with your family. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, I suggest writing a letter to your parents about your experiences in rehab. Let them read it on their own and give them time to process it. In the end, they won\u2019t fully understand. They can\u2019t. You will have started to get out the anger and externalize the fear you experienced. \n\nKeep letting out those feelings in any way you can and to whomever you can that is not destructive.

When he was 13 years old we started having a lot of behavioral issues with him.  He had done well in grade school but when he got to junior high his attitude just became terrible.  He was horribly disrespectful to other people, particularly the other members of the family and both my husband and I.  He was getting into fights, his grades (used to be very good) suddenly became D's and F's and he was in danger of failing and being held back a grade, etc.  His teachers expressed to us on several occasions that he was rude to them and other school staff and was often disruptive in class.  Basically, he was in with the wrong crowd and making problems for other students.  There were other things like being caught shoplifting a few months earlier and he would sneak out at night.  When would ask him where he was going or what he was doing he would just respond defiantly.\n\nWell, we caught him smoking pot with one of his new \"friends\" and it kind of confirmed that he was headed down a road that really kind of scared us.  He swore it was just the first and only time and they had just gotten it from his friend's sister.  We didn't really know and still don't.  We had an option to send him to rehab and based on how bad things had gotten we decided it would be best.  He has expressed to us how miserable it was for the 90 days he was there and he still deals with some issues.  We have him in therapy because he still struggles with anger and we can't help but feel like we may have contributed to that by sending him to rehab at such a young age. We didn't want to do it at the time but we felt like it was our last option and we sometimes still go back and forth wondering if it was for the best.\n\nTo our knowledge, he hasn't touched illicit drugs since then so that makes us feel a little better but there is a lot of resentment towards my husband and I and we were hoping that the therapy might heal some of that.  Well, the other day it came up and I reiterated that our actions are probably justified since he was perfectly functioning member of society and not some junkie living in the streets.  His sister got involved (she likes to play both sides) and it kind of turned into a fight where he called us some choice names, said it was our fault that he is in therapy right now because of the trauma we put him through at 13, called us some choice names and stormed out.  We haven't seen him in a few weeks.\n\nSo, are we the assholes for putting him in rehab at such a young age?\"", "It\u2019s easier to say and harder to do but try not to be angry. I\u2019d do the same for my son at this point. I started smoking weed at 13 and though I didn\u2019t become a junkie or do hard stuff, all of my friends did and I lost many in their process. It\u2019s really sad. We\u2019re in our 30s and many are still in and out of rehab dropping off as the years go by. My family didn\u2019t care because it was just weed but it fueled a lot of negativity and if I\u2019d had done therapy much earlier I\u2019d have a different life. I love my life now, but I could have been much more financially successful on my own with more life experiences. Please, for your own happiness, do not dwell on this. Go use this time wisely and have a truly wonderful life. You deserve it. You did the work too, your parents simply gave you the opportunity. Many come out of rehab with a worse addiction.

When they got to their destinations they were tossed in more vans, blindfolded, and carted for hours off to facilities in the middle of nowhere. \n\nOnce at the facilities, they had their clothing taken away, were forced to do physical checkups and urine tests, then given a uniform to wear. They were told they could contact their parents if they behaved well, and then given a grueling hours-long psych evaluation (administered by a non-psychologist/therapist) and sent off to a room with bunkmates. \n\nOver the course of their stay, they were given daily pills, underfed, had water used as a reward, did hard field labor, and had daily \"circles\" where the contents of their first psych session was read aloud in front of the group in order to shame them into \"recovering\". \n\nAfter a week or so, when they got to call their parents and tell them they were kidnapped and beg to be saved, their parents told them \"no, actually, we paid upwards of $35,000 for you to be doing this wonderful program that will fix your behavior, and you're staying in there until you're fixed!\" \n\nMost of the kids tried to run away at some point, so they were given those thin foam slippers you get at a nail spa, that basically shredded if you attempted to run or walk outside on the rocks/fields outside the compound.

When I moved back to my home country no doctor or psychiatrist would allow me to even continue clonazepam, especially not at such a dosage (plus I was taking 5 max dosage anti psychotics, 3 anti depressants and sleeping pills). So I was hospitalized to try get me off of clonazepam in a safe environment, but the recommended detox is long and complicated, where you eventually switch to valium, and then a milder benzo etc. It is recommended to take months, but the effect I had at that time was luckily not much, so managed to do it over a shorter time period than expected.

Boundaries aren't really telling a parent \"if you do this, I'll stop talking to you,\" and thinking that will change their behavior, they're really more for you to make with yourself, along the lines of giving yourself permission to say to yourself, \"if Dad says this, or engages in this behavior, I will not let myself be drawn into the old dynamic, I will simply disengage.\" Just hanging up on someone when they do something toxic accomplishes the same goal of \"go no contact!\", without the potential negative effects of \"go no contact!\" What's more, even though one should never expect a person to change their behavior when they encounter a boundary, you'd be surprised how often they do.\n\nGoing NC with one parent almost always means having to go no contact with both parents if they are still together, and it results in either having strained relationships with siblings and other family members who will be put in the middle, or having to go NC with them as well. And going NC often just avoids dealing with issues that need to be dealt with, or they'll haunt you down the road. Cutting off contact with parents impetuously can lead to a lot of regret and self-recrimination after they die, either because you didn't confront the reason for the rift, or didn't find a way to let go of the anger, and in the hindsight of wisdom that comes with middle age, may realize a complete severing of the relationship was unnecessary, and feel guilt over not having some kind of rappaproachment with a parent before they died.\n\nI can give the examples of my parents and my wife's mother. My wife is a licensed psychologist, by the way, so her opinions of likely diagnoses aren't just armchair psychology. Her mother likely has narcissistic personality disorder. She lies pathologically, often not even to avoid consequences, or other purpose, just \"because,\" she's been very emotionally abusive toward my wife, including making up lies to make her feel bad, and she subjected my wife to neglect when she was a child. She's very demanding. 12 years ago we were visiting her and overheard her tell our 13 year old son(my stepson) that she'd like to smoke pot with him. We calmly asked her not to say things like that, even couched it in concerns that his father, who is more conservative than us, might make things difficult for us if he found out about this. She flew into a rage, came very close to hitting me, and later accused us of emotionally \"battering\" her. When she would call or send terrible emails, we simply ignored them. She eventually cut off contact with us for a time, and we kind of shrugged our shoulders and said \"that works\". I think she did it, thinking that dramatic gesture would have us running to her trying to smooth things over, but we didn't play ball. After a couple of years she came back, insisting that she and my wife needed to do counseling together (via skype), and they did for several months, but it didn't really go anywhere, and we still didn't budge on the rules if she wanted to have a relationship with us. Eventually my MIL saw the writing on the wall, and realized if she wanted any kind of relationship with her daughter or grandchildren, she needed to play ball by our rules. She and my wife started talking on the phone semi-regularly, and we've had a few visits out to see her (we always stay in a hotel) that have been perfectly pleasant, and now that she has end-stage COPD, my wife feels at peace, that she has no guilt, she was compassionate to her mother in the end of her life.\n\nMy mother was verbally and physically abusive when I was a child, my dad was busy running a company and was kind of absent for a lot of it, and enabled her. And my parents tend to want to control their sons' lives, even as adults, would demand that we attend functions (we live in the same city) even when they were very inconvenient for a family with small children. My mother would try to triangulate my brothers and me against each other, Oh, and my mother was trying to talk me out of marrying my wife up until the week of the wedding, because she didn't approve of my wife being 5 years older and divorced with a child. Eventually we had to put our foot down about all the demands for our time and attempts to guilt us, and my parents' tenor changed, again, the realization that they didn't have power over us, and if they wanted to have a pleasant relationship with us, they'd have to just accept what we were willing to give. Now my mother has alzheimers, and is surprisingly pleasant. She doesn't have the memory anymore to hold grudges, and while she wasn't a good mother, she did love me, and as the disease has stripped away all the convulted issues that made her a broken person (her own father was abusive), her love for her sons remains, and is the core of her personality. We always have pleasant conversations, and now at the end of her life, both she and my father are appreciative of the support I am happy to give, as I look at her with more compassion, and am at peace with the past.\n\nToo often the \"go no contact!' cri de coeur here on reddit is motivated by a desire to \"punish\" the other party for the past, to show them how the person has power to take something (themselves) away from the punishee. It's actually not as powerful as people think it is, saying \"these are the rules for having a relationship with me, take it or leave it\" is much more powerful than doing something that could be spun by the other person as taking your ball and going home. The situation with my MIL, where we set rules, and she was the one who went no contact\" and then had to come crawling back to us, shows this. And I know most of the people on this sub are younger, don't have a lot of life experience, so let me as someone in his mid-40s say with age and life experience comes perspective, the ability to see people you once saw as toxic AHs as merely broken people who were likely broken by someone when they were younger, and you can have compassion for them. Compassion and forgiveness of others, even when they don't ask for it, is the best gift you can give yourself.", "Yeah I read up on it a while back when the whole scandale with Dr Phil and Bhad Babie went public, and read about Paris Hilton's experience, and it all sounds so wild it becomes unreal... like the same states that force birth, wants to ban drag bc THINK OF THE CHILDREN also have these kinds of institutions!?

They saw dollar signs and gladly cashed that check. He is also NTA by any stretch of the imagination.", "I also had three friends that were sent (kidnapped during the night) to these kinds of places. Two were sent to was Kids Helping Kids in Ohio which was a clone of that Elan program. One friend\u2019s mother regretted sending him after he actually escaped miraculously once, no shoes or clothes besides underwear in the dead of winter, in a rural area, but she couldn\u2019t undo it at that point bc it somehow became court ordered once she enrolled him. He was taken back and spent about a year of his life there. \n\n\nMy third friend was taken from his home in Florida and sent to a really fucked up place in Colorado. He was admittedly experimenting with some harder drugs before this and his mom and step dad were at the end of their rope. The facility he was sent to was awful. He was sexually assaulted by a staff member. The kids that are higher up in the ranks in these \u201cprograms\u201d are encouraged, if not expected to emotionally abuse the kids in the lower ranks. Basically, you cannot work your way through the program to get out unless you participate in the fuckery. \n\nMy three friends that went to these two places shared a couple things in common; they had very strict controlling parents and they bucked against that, which seemed to be why they were sent, they were also absolutely way more fucked up after having been subjected to these abusive long term situations. I mean, deeply, deeply emotionally scarred, and absolutely wholly changed people. \n\n\nI guess what I\u2019m getting at here is that from what I\u2019ve seen there was either the type of parent that was furious that their son would not fall into line and be the good church going, athletic, straight laced, hetero, ace student, exemplary older brother*or* there was the parent that was genuinely worried about their son\u2019s future and the decisions he\u2019d been making/the crowd he was running with. I think with all those families the relationships between child and parent(s) was so strained, and the parents put too much pressure on their kids to be this perfect, high achieving, brag-to-our-friends, do-what-I-say-never-question-me, rather than getting to know their kid, and helping them succeed. I know it\u2019s not * always* easy, but if you can be reasonable, somewhat articulate, and empathetic with your child *while* they grow up, they\u2019ll trust you, and you\u2019ll be able to trust them. Parents that bark orders, who also inconsistently handle a child\u2019s behavior are probably more likely to send their kid off to this weird penal hell, and by doing that, effectively killing their relationship with their child, even if they might think \u201coh, this will fix him..\u201d  A lot of those kids that\u2019ve been sent to these nightmares would\u2019ve been better off if the parents fixed themselves instead.", "Ah balls.", "I just cut out people (they know how bad he was) who say I need to have contact with my dad at this point.

My sister was a troubled youth who fell into the wrong crowd and tried weed at 13...she ended up falling further in because my parents didn't want to be cruel and send her away to rehab for a long period of time. She went through every drug possible and dragged my family through some of the worst things imaginable, including almost killing her youngest son while doped up. Luckily something finally clicked for her and she did recover, but she spent most of her 20s in and out of rehab and it'll never truly be over for her. Sometimes I wonder if my parents had sent her away for 3 months in a rehab for weed if she wouldn't have straightened up and came out on the other side a whole lot sooner like you.
