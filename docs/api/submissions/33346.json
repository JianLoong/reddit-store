He\u2019s making it about himself while the girls are happy. They\u2019re not your kids and he needs to stop being a jerk. Kath had an extra rough year and you wanted to cheer her up which is kind of you. No one was mistreated and not everything has to be the same for both sisters. You sound like a lovey person. I hope he gets over himself and sees that", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have to justify your reason to give someone a present, extra or not. It is the thought that counts.. does carl ask the prices of your presents each year?? What if one daughter gets a present that is a dollar more!!! Omg first world problem. I bet the daughters don\u2019t even care.", "NTA, I think Carl should allow you to build a relationship with the daughters that is not tit for tat. You obviously care very much for them and you are also teaching them how to care for people when they go through tough times. You can\u2019t buy all your friends flowers just because one is grieving.", "NTA, if the kids had no problems and it was simply you wanting to cheer her up after a shitty life event then good on you\ud83d\udc4d", "Oh come on its not like you brought one a computer and the other a plush \n\nCarl needs to get a grip and be lucky he has a friend who would do this for his daughters in the first place\n\nNTA", "Nta life isn\u2019t fair and as a parent you have to prepare your kids to deal with that. \n\nAmelia is probably able to realize that Kaths been through it this year and her getting additional attention and support while she is healing doesn\u2019t take away from the love Amelia gets. \n\nYour friend needs to chill", "Nta and your friend is an ah", "NTA\nThis you must do for both of you do for one is BS. They are individuals and should be treated as such.", "NTA\n\nThe girls had no problem with it. Btw they are not little kids anymore so I'm sure Amelia understands concepts such as 'giving someone a gift to comfort them or make them feel better'. Do you also have to measure your gifts so they are the same size because the girls might get the wrong impression? If only I had such problems my life would be much easier to go through.", "NTA. If the girls had no issue with this, your friend shouldn't have a say. Maybe the sisters don't keep score between themselves, or perhaps Amelia sees that her sister has had a tougher year and doesn't care that she got an extra gift. (Cute idea, btw, of a baked treat and another gift!)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

They are both my best friend \u2018Carl\u2019s daughters.\n\nNormally I buy them two birthday presents each, one from a bakery and one depending on current interests, but this year is a bit different. I will give a brief timeline :\n\n- In June, I bought Amelia a chocolate eclair and a stuffed panda (her favorite animal).\n\n - In September, Kath\u2019s boyfriend cheated on her with and got her best friend pregnant.\n\n- In November, Kath was badly injured playing football, getting a broken leg.\n\nSo two days ago I gave her three presents : a hazelnut praline cupcake, \u2018The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\u2019(she likes detective novels) and a Pok\u00e9mon plush. Thought that it might cheer her up to get an extra gift this year after all the shit that happened to her recently.\n\nThe girls didn\u2019t have any issues but my friend was still unhappy, saying it was \u2018reckless\u2019 of me to do something that might give Amelia the wrong impression.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
