For example, if he's asking for something at the store, SIL will call BIL and say \"the kid is asking for 'x', should I get it for him?\". They do it when they seem to think he's acting entitled or spoilt. I always bite my tongue, but in my opinion it's dehumanizing and derogatory and how you talk about an annoying stray cat, not a child. \n\nToday we were all at grandma's house and my daughter got a popsicle from the freezer. In my household, we dont have to ask for permission to get sustenance. However BIL and SIL have old school ideas about the \"right\" time to eat something. So when nephew saw daughter with a popsicle, he went and asked his mom for one. SIL looked at him, didn't even acknowledged what he'd asked, and shouted to BIL in another room, \"BIL, you think the kid should have a popsicle?\" and winked at me. \n\nI don't know why I decided today that enough was enough but I snapped back \"don't wink at me like it's some joke, and [nephew's name] is your son, not a goat. Stop calling him 'the kid'\". \n\nYou would think I'd said I was announcing WW3 tomorrow. SIL immediately snapped back something along the lines of if I had an issue I shouldn't say that in front of our children, and then left the room and did not talk to to me the rest of the visit. Later my husband received a text message from MIL saying I need to apologize for \"criticizing and insulting SIL in front of nephew\". Husband says I should just apologize. \n\nI don't think I have anything to apologize for. She's so upset because she knows I'm right, she's just being pigheaded. I honestly don't regret it even a little and wish I'd called out the behavior before my nephew was old enough to remember being referred to like that. But at least when he's older he will know an adult in his life stood up for him. \n\nIt's causing more drama then I honestly think it deserves.

It reminds the other parent that they are a parent and it is their turn to say yes or no because the same person shouldn't always be the good or bad guy or because in the current situation they are the more appropriate person to ask. It reminds the kid that they overstepped a little bit. You should be offered a snack in someone else's home and that it is a treat they are not entitled to.  It is a very gentle reminder that allows for self correction because it is not a huge misstep.\n\nFamily position names are natural and help with parenting.
