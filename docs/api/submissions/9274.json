For example, if he's asking for something at the store, SIL will call BIL and say \"the kid is asking for 'x', should I get it for him?\". They do it when they seem to think he's acting entitled or spoilt. I always bite my tongue, but in my opinion it's dehumanizing and derogatory and how you talk about an annoying stray cat, not a child. \n\nToday we were all at grandma's house and my daughter got a popsicle from the freezer. In my household, we dont have to ask for permission to get sustenance. However BIL and SIL have old school ideas about the \"right\" time to eat something. So when nephew saw daughter with a popsicle, he went and asked his mom for one. SIL looked at him, didn't even acknowledged what he'd asked, and shouted to BIL in another room, \"BIL, you think the kid should have a popsicle?\" and winked at me. \n\nI don't know why I decided today that enough was enough but I snapped back \"don't wink at me like it's some joke, and [nephew's name] is your son, not a goat. Stop calling him 'the kid'\". \n\nYou would think I'd said I was announcing WW3 tomorrow. SIL immediately snapped back something along the lines of if I had an issue I shouldn't say that in front of our children, and then left the room and did not talk to to me the rest of the visit. Later my husband received a text message from MIL saying I need to apologize for \"criticizing and insulting SIL in front of nephew\". Husband says I should just apologize. \n\nI don't think I have anything to apologize for. She's so upset because she knows I'm right, she's just being pigheaded. I honestly don't regret it even a little and wish I'd called out the behavior before my nephew was old enough to remember being referred to like that. But at least when he's older he will know an adult in his life stood up for him. \n\nIt's causing more drama then I honestly think it deserves.

It reminds the other parent that they are a parent and it is their turn to say yes or no because the same person shouldn't always be the good or bad guy or because in the current situation they are the more appropriate person to ask. It reminds the kid that they overstepped a little bit. You should be offered a snack in someone else's home and that it is a treat they are not entitled to.  It is a very gentle reminder that allows for self correction because it is not a huge misstep.\n\nFamily position names are natural and help with parenting.

My dynamic with my parents is no one else's business, as long as no one is being harmed. A simple nickname is not harming anyone or \"dehumanizing\" them.\n\nMy SIL and her husband call each other \"Mothership\" and \"Fathership\" with their kids, and their kids cringe and call their parents those same names when trying to be funny. It's nothing more than familial rapport.\n\nOP is TA, and the person you're replying to needs a reality check rofl.", "Thankfully not a common one but my own mum does occasionally call me \"The best shit she ever had.\"...", "There's a kids book with baby ducks named widdle, waddle, piddle and little quack, and that is instantly where my mind went seeing the nicknames.", "We call our dog the Monster Puppy :)\nHe's very sweet, just very large.", "Maybe grandma doesn't make them ask. I mean you're jumping to conclusions based on nothing. When I stayed with my grandmother, we never had to ask either. Every family is different", "My mom had a korean nickname for me. I never really knew where it came from or if its a real word, but I knew it was just for me. She never called my older sisters this. I think it's a deliberately silly way to pronounce the korean word for \"kid\".\n\nI'm in my 40s now, and she hasn't called me that for ages. I've been staying with them while they need help with some things, and brought my little dog with me, who has been bonding with my mom (they've never been dog people). She now has started to call my dog that same nickname, and it just tickles me.", "Maybe not so endearing, but its what Logan Roy calls Shiv on \"Succession\". I thought it was cute, even though they're horrible people."]}
