{"id": 21402, "submission_id": "14rb6io", "title": "AITA for trying to convince my partner to adopt a kid that might be racist?", "selftext": "I (31M) and my partner (33M) decided a few years ago that we wanted to have a child. We discussed surrogacy and adoption, eventually going with the latter because we wanted to give a child a home. It has been a long, difficult process, but now we have the opportunity to adopt a little 6-year old girl. For the context of this story, my husband and I are white, but he is a bit tanner. The little girl, \"Chloe\", is African-American. We were so charmed by her when we met and she seems really fun and outgoing. I was concerned she might worry at the \"two dads\" thing, but she didn't comment on it at all (keep in mind, we are not near adoption yet, just first meeting). The idea was to foster first since we already went through the process (but not set in stone).\n\nAbout halfway through the meeting, my partner started acting weird. He was talking to her less and seemed less interested. We said goodbye and I asked what was up in the car. My partner said \"She asked if she was going to have to live with white people\". I was shocked but laughed and he said it was when I was using the restroom. I shrugged it off and told him she probably doesn't understand and we would have to expect some things when adopting a child. He called her racist and said there was nothing we can do about it. I said that was WAY too harsh and she was a wonderful kid. She said something she shouldn't have and if we were able to adopt her, that is something that we would have to address.\n\nMy partner lost it, saying that adopting a kid that would be racist towards us will not work and I was setting us up for failure. We needed the kid to 'feel right' if we were going to make a big life-altering change like adoption. Now I am upset because I don't know if he is right or not. Are we supposed to wait for this life-altering feeling when adopting a child? I really loved spending time with Chloe and KNOW IN MY HEART that we would give her a wonderful home. My partner says that I am not listening to his feelings on the matter. I can concede that when we were looking at the adoption process, I thought our homosexuality would be the issue, not our race. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: HELLO ALL, thank you for the thoughts. I showed my partner my post and while he wasn't happy about sharing our info, but he is very thankful for many of the perspectives. He wanted me to write (to redditors) that he is not racist. He is however, scared of the kid we adopt not liking him and he is projecting a bit. I told him that I did not think that was the situation we were in. I truly thought that (based on the comments), Chloe was not indicating that she did not like us or want to spend time with us. I told him that his fear of a kid not liking us was completely overblown and that no matter what kid we got, they would love us if we love them. We had a long conversation about what it would be like to adopt a child of a different race. Absolutely it will be different. There are a ton of things that she might ask and we will have to be honest and say we need to look it up, or reach out to a contact int he community that can help. It is still a huge decision for her and us, but I will not shy away from difficulty.\n\nToday is the last day of a 3-day 4th of July event for a bunch of the kids and we already had planned to go. We did see Chloe and she looked so happy to see us! She wanted to show us the crafts she made and play in the games together. When she chose my husband to be her race partner over me, he was over the moon. They are about to start, I am typing from the sidelines. To those that said that we can't adopt a black child, I have no idea what to expect. I am nervous but excited to see what happens.\n\nEDIT: People are asking if we had ever fostered or adopted. Yes, fostered many times. But these were always emergency placements where we get a call and get ready.

She might have picked up some ideas around that from her previous living situations and some of those views may well be toxic.

We discussed surrogacy and adoption, eventually going with the latter because we wanted to give a child a home. It has been a long, difficult process, but now we have the opportunity to adopt a little 6-year old girl. For the context of this story, my husband and I are white, but he is a bit tanner. The little girl, \"Chloe\", is African-American. We were so charmed by her when we met and she seems really fun and outgoing. I was concerned she might worry at the \"two dads\" thing, but she didn't comment on it at all (keep in mind, we are not near adoption yet, just first meeting). The idea was to foster first since we already went through the process (but not set in stone).\n\nAbout halfway through the meeting, my partner started acting weird. He was talking to her less and seemed less interested. We said goodbye and I asked what was up in the car. My partner said \"She asked if she was going to have to live with white people\". I was shocked but laughed and he said it was when I was using the restroom. I shrugged it off and told him she probably doesn't understand and we would have to expect some things when adopting a child. He called her racist and said there was nothing we can do about it. I said that was WAY too harsh and she was a wonderful kid. She said something she shouldn't have and if we were able to adopt her, that is something that we would have to address.\n\nMy partner lost it, saying that adopting a kid that would be racist towards us will not work and I was setting us up for failure.

Are we supposed to wait for this life-altering feeling when adopting a child? I really loved spending time with Chloe and KNOW IN MY HEART that we would give her a wonderful home. My partner says that I am not listening to his feelings on the matter. I can concede that when we were looking at the adoption process, I thought our homosexuality would be the issue, not our race.

It\u2019s not racist if she would rather be with a family that looks like her. She has lost her own family and is in the system. That is traumatic and her needs should be considered before your needs to adopt a child.

Parenting is hard enough, and interracial parenting is even harder in the sense that there will be the addition of culture shock and ignorance on both sides, and if you and your partner are not prepared to manage hiccups that arise with grace and compassion, you will not be able to give this child as good a home as they likely need. I have no doubt that you have the capability of providing a good home for children, but noticing racial differences is natural, and you will not succeed at parenting this child if you\u2019re going to flip out at stuff like this. It\u2019s also not enough to shrug off and hope these questions and conversations resolve on their own.

Maybe she liked them and was devastated they brought her back. Maybe they were racist towards her and treated her like a 'slave' and told her she has to listen because they're white etc. Maybe she just passingly said it, like oh they're different to me they're white....as kids do observe these things. It's quite normal for any kid in this situation to ask 'will I live with you now?' she just pointed out your differences as well, because it's what kids do.\n\nI remember (more so because there's a photograph) of the first time I seen a black man, i was around her age...

The black kids gravitate to the best black teachers, the Latino kids gravitate towards the Latino/Spanish speaking teachers, there's a lot of reasons for it. It's not even entirely about race but culture. Not being looked down on for speaking Spanish or vernacular, for instance. You need to really think about how to preserve links to her community for her, because there's so much they're just not going to be able to reach her.
