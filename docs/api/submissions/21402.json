We discussed surrogacy and adoption, eventually going with the latter because we wanted to give a child a home. It has been a long, difficult process, but now we have the opportunity to adopt a little 6-year old girl. For the context of this story, my husband and I are white, but he is a bit tanner. The little girl, \"Chloe\", is African-American. We were so charmed by her when we met and she seems really fun and outgoing. I was concerned she might worry at the \"two dads\" thing, but she didn't comment on it at all (keep in mind, we are not near adoption yet, just first meeting). The idea was to foster first since we already went through the process (but not set in stone).\n\nAbout halfway through the meeting, my partner started acting weird. He was talking to her less and seemed less interested. We said goodbye and I asked what was up in the car. My partner said \"She asked if she was going to have to live with white people\". I was shocked but laughed and he said it was when I was using the restroom. I shrugged it off and told him she probably doesn't understand and we would have to expect some things when adopting a child. He called her racist and said there was nothing we can do about it. I said that was WAY too harsh and she was a wonderful kid. She said something she shouldn't have and if we were able to adopt her, that is something that we would have to address.\n\nMy partner lost it, saying that adopting a kid that would be racist towards us will not work and I was setting us up for failure. We needed the kid to 'feel right' if we were going to make a big life-altering change like adoption. Now I am upset because I don't know if he is right or not. Are we supposed to wait for this life-altering feeling when adopting a child? I really loved spending time with Chloe and KNOW IN MY HEART that we would give her a wonderful home. My partner says that I am not listening to his feelings on the matter. I can concede that when we were looking at the adoption process, I thought our homosexuality would be the issue, not our race.

She might have picked up some ideas around that from her previous living situations and some of those views may well be toxic.

We discussed surrogacy and adoption, eventually going with the latter because we wanted to give a child a home. It has been a long, difficult process, but now we have the opportunity to adopt a little 6-year old girl. For the context of this story, my husband and I are white, but he is a bit tanner. The little girl, \"Chloe\", is African-American. We were so charmed by her when we met and she seems really fun and outgoing. I was concerned she might worry at the \"two dads\" thing, but she didn't comment on it at all (keep in mind, we are not near adoption yet, just first meeting). The idea was to foster first since we already went through the process (but not set in stone).\n\nAbout halfway through the meeting, my partner started acting weird. He was talking to her less and seemed less interested. We said goodbye and I asked what was up in the car. My partner said \"She asked if she was going to have to live with white people\". I was shocked but laughed and he said it was when I was using the restroom. I shrugged it off and told him she probably doesn't understand and we would have to expect some things when adopting a child. He called her racist and said there was nothing we can do about it. I said that was WAY too harsh and she was a wonderful kid. She said something she shouldn't have and if we were able to adopt her, that is something that we would have to address.\n\nMy partner lost it, saying that adopting a kid that would be racist towards us will not work and I was setting us up for failure. We needed the kid to 'feel right' if we were going to make a big life-altering change like adoption. Now I am upset because I don't know if he is right or not. Are we supposed to wait for this life-altering feeling when adopting a child? I really loved spending time with Chloe and KNOW IN MY HEART that we would give her a wonderful home.

Parenting is hard enough, and interracial parenting is even harder in the sense that there will be the addition of culture shock and ignorance on both sides, and if you and your partner are not prepared to manage hiccups that arise with grace and compassion, you will not be able to give this child as good a home as they likely need. I have no doubt that you have the capability of providing a good home for children, but noticing racial differences is natural, and you will not succeed at parenting this child if you\u2019re going to flip out at stuff like this. It\u2019s also not enough to shrug off and hope these questions and conversations resolve on their own.

Maybe she liked them and was devastated they brought her back. Maybe they were racist towards her and treated her like a 'slave' and told her she has to listen because they're white etc. Maybe she just passingly said it, like oh they're different to me they're white....as kids do observe these things. It's quite normal for any kid in this situation to ask 'will I live with you now?' she just pointed out your differences as well, because it's what kids do.\n\nI remember (more so because there's a photograph) of the first time I seen a black man, i was around her age...

Now I should probably tell you that, in France, you don\u2019t get to \u201cchoose\u201d the child you adopt, and from what I understand they are more or less assigned at random. That means that our white-ass family (including surviving grandparents) all learned to properly care for and braid my sister\u2019s hair, that later on when she started wanting more complicated hairstyles that they simply weren\u2019t able to create, my very white dad took her to proper salons that knew how to do that for her (he really enjoyed experiencing those places and they really welcomed him, but it was a strange thing at first!), and so on. \n\nUnless both you and your partner are fully willing to do that work for your child and possibly put yourself in situations you may find uncomfortable: don\u2019t adopt Chloe.

The black kids gravitate to the best black teachers, the Latino kids gravitate towards the Latino/Spanish speaking teachers, there's a lot of reasons for it. It's not even entirely about race but culture. Not being looked down on for speaking Spanish or vernacular, for instance. You need to really think about how to preserve links to her community for her, because there's so much they're just not going to be able to reach her.
