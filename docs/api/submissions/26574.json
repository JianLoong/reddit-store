I (32m) don't want to go into detail, but in their youth they took part in many communist protests in my country and were involved in many active organizations on the streets. They were detained and interrogated many times for this. My father was also imprisoned as a political criminal and had some terrible incidents there.\r\n\nThey both love to talk about communism and their experiences in those days. Many of my friends have listened to their stories and they think they are cool. I find them cool too and I like to listen to them, but when they tell these stories to someone who is not into politics it can be awkward.\n\nI'm going to bring my girlfriend (23f) to meet them next weekend, we're going to have a dinner together. When I was planning it with them, I asked them if it was possible not to talk about communism and those days. My gf is not really into politics, and some of these stories can be very harsh. I want our first dinner together to be a bit more chill.\n\nMy parents didn't object to my request, but they were a bit offended. They told me that if I was uncomfortable with these I could have told them a long time ago. I am not really bothered or embarrassed by them, I just wanted the dinner to go without getting into deep topics.\n\nMy brother said I was being a bit of an asshole. Now I feel bad too, I didn't mean to offend them.

As long as you aren't planning on hiding this from your gf and only want a calm first dinner.  \n\nI am more concerned about the age gap but you didn't ask about that.", "Their remark was about you not telling them sooner, I think they might be feeling a bit awkward about talking about it in the past. Reassure them that that's not the case, and your request is only for the initial meeting of your girlfriend, and you never minded it in the past, you just want a different focus during this first dinner (that's what I think you meant based on your post?).", "NTA, my family is super into political discussions but we all know that first time meetings aren't the right space for that. It's perfectly fine to keep to lighter topics during the time where everyone is being introduced for the first time.", "Wtf are these comments? Y\u2019all need to go out and touch some grass . Not everyone wants to talk about politics the first time they meet their significant others family. \n\nAre y\u2019all mentally challenged? Seriously who talks about politics when they first meet someone.\n\n\nI CANT WITH PEOPLE .. NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO DO WITH POLITICS .. LIFE OUTSIDE OF POLITICS EXISTS \n\nNTA", "NAH \nyour parents seem upset because they think you're uncomfortable with it, maybe just explain that you like the stories but your gf isn't into politics so you'd prefer not to hear them at this dinner. It doesn't seem like a big issue at all to me", "I LOVE talking politics and could spend the whole night enthralled by your parents' stories, but I agree that it's not a good topic for a dinner table with the potential for opposing views. NTA", "They will be fine. They'll survive a dinner without mentioning communism, they don't need to make it the center of conversation every time.\n\nI understand your desire to keep the atmosphere casual and relaxed, and they'll be able to tell their stories at a second or third dinner.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Politics is always tricky in a family.  Sometimes it is better to just avoid the topic altogether which is what you are suggesting.  You know more about your GF at this point and I don't see that YWBYA to set down some boundaries at all.  As you said many of your and friends and you think it is cool listening their stories, others may not though.  But may I suggest that you have this discussion with your GF to gauge where she stands, she might not mind at all.  Let her decide what conversations she is willing to abide by.  You may be surprised at her response.  But if she doesn't care for the subject, you can relay her feelings to your parents and go from there.", "NAH. It's perfectly reasonable to request not bringing up politics at a first meeting and it sounds like they agreed to your request. If I were you I'd clarify that you're fine with the topic and not uncomfortable as it seems they may have misunderstood your feelings a little judging from that response.", "NTA I am also a communist but I know not to bring it up randomly. You likely wouldn\u2019t even know unless you directly asked me. It\u2019s polarizing.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't want somebody talking positively about communism with me. Ever. Same thing as talking positively about nazism, it would be equally bad. Both led to millions of deaths and persecution of people, and both are insanely extremist ideologies that are dangerous.", "Nah. I mean it's fine not to talk about something the first time you meet someone. And not everything is chill night material. \n\nMy mom is closely associated with a foundation that helps parents with children who have cancer. I asked her not to talk about kids with cancer the first time she met my gf cause it is a dour and downer subject. She wasn't hurt. And the second/third time they met my talked about it and it was fine.", "Dude your parents sound full of themselves and lacking integral self awareness. Politics and religion are the 2 things you should socially understand as things not to be discussed at a public dinner table. NTA.", "NAH\n\nNot wanting the conversation to turn to a heavy poitical discussion is perfectly understandable, but your request was a bit tactless, and you're also underestimating the ability of your parents and your girlfriend to carry on a pleasant conversation without you setting the parameters for them \n\nGo apologise to your parents.", "NAH. Ask yourself if you really want your girlfriend to meet your parents. I get that it could to be awkward for her, but it could also lead to some very entertaining \u201cmeet the parents\u201d stories years from now. Just lean into them and forwarn your girlfriend \u201cmy parent's whole lives revolve around being political activists, be prepared for some crazy stories.\u201d You can always redirect the conversation as needed.", "Yta. Comrade, think of all the benefits of Communism! Best to find out now if your devochka bleeds red.", "YTA\n\nWhat is the problem really?\n\nI'm not into politics, still stories like the ones your parents tell are very cool. Honestly I'd love to hang out with your parents, they sound fun.", "NTA but your GF needs a head's up", "Brother which country you are from? And I hate communism very much. I like capitalism in a limit.", "YTA. Maybe your parents could just give her a ball of yarn or something sparkly with which to play.", "I'm not into rocks but if some geologist talked about rocks, I'll think of it as cool story. it all depend on how good of story tellers your parents are. \n\nin any case, YTA. I though she had specific issue with communism or something. \n(I know many people from USSR really hate talking or hearing about communism, for obvious reasons)\n\n\nP.S did you even talked to your GF about it?", "YTA. Because your girlfriend is coming. She may be come long term...", "YTA. You could ask them to leave out some of the harsher details, but you have essentially asked them not to talk to your gf about a big part of who they are. How are they supposed to get to know each other if you want to censor conversations", "YTA\u2014 you\u2019re asking them to hide something extremely important about themselves, of course that\u2019s painful. It hurts when the part of yourself that you\u2019re proud of a love is part of yourself someone who loves you wants you to hide. My ex told me his family didn\u2019t like me because I use big words and have too many opinions and then complained that I didn\u2019t warm up to them enough and was too stand offish\u2014 it\u2019s hard to get close to people when you\u2019re hiding parts of yourself. \n\nI think you could have worded it differently. They probably heard \u201cpretend to be Ward and June Cleaver\u201d but maybe saying you just worry that the more violent stories are hard to hear before she knows them well would go over better.", "NTA but not you being 10 years older than your gf. \ud83e\udd22", "YTA for deciding on behalf of your girlfriend that your parents' discussions would be inappropriate. You insult her and them instead of being able to talk to your gf and let her know what the discourse would be like and help with handling it with composure. You spread a lot of offense around instead of communicating.", "YTA. Date someone who is mature enough to hear about communism and this isn't a problem", "She\u2019s young. She will bounce back if things get a bit strange at dinner. It\u2019s better that she not too concerned about politics in this case. Just tell her to compliment your mom\u2019s cooking and it will be fine. Maybe bring a nice cake from a bakery too.", "YTA", "Absolutely NTA.", "NTA. Politics aren\u2019t a good topic for meeting someone for the first time.", "NTA. It's fine for them to talk about their life history. If things progress with your gf, they shouldn't have to conceal that stuff. It's just not \"first date\" material.", "NTA - politics can be dodgy ground and I would tend to treat it delicately on an introduction too.", "NTA, while I hold some communistic views myself it's definitely been propagandized as \"extreme\" and some people will consider that to be a very bad first impression. I think it's fair to ask to stick to light, easy topics for their first dinner with their GF.", "They\u2019re fucking weird. If they can\u2019t understand how opposing political views can cause awkwardness at a dinner table, they haven\u2019t had enough human interaction. It\u2019s common courtesy to not talk about heavy subjects at dinner with guests or in public.\n\nAnd if these parents don\u2019t have anything else to their identity than being youth extremists, then that makes them very weird and gives me \u201cman if coach just put me in last quarter, we\u2019d have made to state\u201d of not letting go of the past type vibes.", "Calm down buttercup.", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs&ab\\_channel=rascrifice", "I hope you keep that same energy for the current all-time world champion of human misery, colonial capitalism.", "As an eastern european, agreed!!! OP\u2019s parents are idiots and if I were the girlfriend, I\u2019d run the other way. Talking about communism in a positive way is pretty sickening. \n\nNTA OP.", "honestly i think he given his gf much less credit then she deserve. he assume, for some reason, that she can't handle anything more the surface level", "So talk about it a few visits later.", "all family dinners should be about communism, right guys?", "Op said his gf isn\u2019t into politics, which is also awkward because if someone doesn\u2019t have the same interests like you you can\u2019t have a 2 sided conversation.\n\nIt\u2019s like if someone starts talking to me about sports , I know nothing about sports , and it\u2019s awkward to do a conversation like this for all the parties involved.\n\nDon\u2019t get me started on how stupid it is to mention politics or religion when you first meet someone because not everyone supports the same things. Same people are aggressive about their side and things can escalate. \n\nAnd frankly not everyone cares about politics", "Lol history doesn\u2019t support this statement in the slightest.\n\nImagine thinking there is anything defensible with respect to communism after bearing witness to the 20th century.", "Excellent point. Also is just like to mention on how everyone in the comments can\u2019t grasp the concept that this dinner is about OP and their GF. It isn\u2019t about OPs extremist parents.", "Once again AITA missing the point of the post !!\n\nOp just wants to introduce his girlfriend and they literally made it about politics and that he shouldn\u2019t suppress his parents beliefs , when this isn\u2019t at all what he is doing . HE JUST WANTS TO HAVE DINNER IN PEACE , A SIMPLE INTRODUCTION!!!!", "Lol it\u2019s a symptom of being chronically online. I know what it\u2019s like, I can have an unhealthy relationship with the internet, but some people really need to get out there, experience the good and the bad of life and stop thinking so reactively about situations and use compassion and logic. But I\u2019m probably wrong to them about that"]}
