Confused because I wasn\u2019t scheduled to take a lunch, I asked him why. He said my mom told him I was hungry and if I wanted to take a lunch I could. I thanked him but explained that I didn\u2019t want to give up the overtime, or leave later than scheduled to take the lunch and I could order delivery if I got really hungry. \nHours later my mom emailed me asking what I wanted to eat. I asked if having her pick up subway would be too much to ask. She asked what I wanted. I sent her back an email with my detailed sub order. She grabbed my debit card, went to subway, and returned. \nWhen she walked up to me with the food I was ecstatic, I\u2019d barely eaten all day. She said \u201cthe lady who made your sub put lettuce on it.\u201d \nThe first time I got Covid my tastes changed and I developed a hatred for lettuce. Lettuce tasted dirty and the smell was repulsive to me. My mom knew about this change in my diet, as well as the origin behind it.\nSeeing my disappointment my mom insisted that the woman from subway \u201cwouldn\u2019t listen to her\u201d about not putting lettuce on the sub.\nEven the thought of digging through ranch and other toppings to remove the lettuce on the sub me made me want to gag. I did at least open up the sun to see if maybe there wasn\u2019t that much lettuce, but it was like 90% of it.\nLater I went to the bathroom, walking past my mom\u2019s desk to do so, and quietly told her I appreciated the effort of her getting me lunch, even if it didn\u2019t turn out the way I wanted it to, and her response was \u201cjust pick it off.\u201d I was reminded of my childhood, when I was often forced or tricked into eating foods I didn\u2019t like and ended up crying in the bathroom. I gathered myself and went back to my desk.\nI did my best to go back to my work eating chips that came with the sub. I know I could\u2019ve easily replaced the sub with a different meal at this point, but honestly the slew of emotions, the smell of the lettuce, and the entire situation made me not want to eat anymore.\nLater my mom came in my department and told my boss she locked her keys in her car (and her car only has one key). He said he\u2019d figure something out for her (and he did). I jokingly asked why she would lock her keys in the car. She turned to me, the same look on her face that I associated with getting yelled at when I was a child, and said \u201cI left them in there when I got you that stupid sandwich you\u2019re bitching about.\u201d\nI feel like I\u2019ve done something wrong by not eating the sub my mom went out of her way to get me, just because it was made wrong.

That way it can't go wrong. I doubt the lady put the lettuce on and refused to take it off.", "NTA you should ever feel guilty for simply having feelings.", "NTA. Sounds like it was a really overwhelming day and I hope the next one is better! It doesn't sound like your mom takes your issues with lettuce seriously, otherwise, she would have said something when your sandwich was being made. And her comment about locking her keys in the car to get you the sandwich is really more about an issue with her than you. She's the AH, not you.", "NTA. Your mom sounds toxic. Subway literally makes the sandwich in front of you and if it\u2019s not right, they remake it.

When the children are older they check their own food. If anything is NOT per what we ordered it is returned and the correct order is asked for.\n\nI even do this at a drive thru. \n\nThe mother in this case is not very considerate of her daughter, the OP.", "ESH- your reaction was a bit childish and self-indulgent. Particularly where you noted that you could have replaced the sandwich but chose not to due to the slew of emotions. Also, all kids are pressured to eat food they don\u2019t like, but you can\u2019t cry about it as an adult. But your mother should not speak like that to you, whether your boss is there or not. You should make it clear to her that she will not and can not embarrass you like that in a public setting.", "NTA - simply because she blamed it on the subway lady, a subway employee will not just add lettuce and refuse to take it off. That simply does not happen, you tell them what to put on it.\n\nShe lied. And now she\u2019s throwing a fit because you didn\u2019t eat the sandwich that YOU paid for, and she OFFERED to go get for you, because she knows she made such an avoidable mistake.

Your reaction to lettuce is very unusual. Picking it off is a valid normal solution unless you have some allergy where that\u2019s not an option. A normal way to go about it would have been just say \u201coh damn ok I guess I\u2019ll remove the lettuce\u201d. Crying was also a huge overreaction.

I think working on finding solutions is better than dwelling on things. Your mum tried to help you out and then made you feel guilty about it which wasn\u2019t cool but this whole ordeal didn\u2019t need to be super dramatic.

If I picked out one of the foods and presented it as proof I was told I \u201ccouldn\u2019t tell the difference\u201d and was accused of lying if I said I could.

One of my housemates ate my prepped meals and I didn\u2019t have a lunch today as a result.", "Also, slightly unrelated. Take your lunch breaks!!!!!!!!!! It\u2019s SO illegal for them to not make you take your lunch. \n\nAt least in most US states, and for most jobs (I\u2019ll take the risk of assuming you don\u2019t have a super rare labor/chemical/lab/medical position) you legally HAVE to take a 30 minute break for every 4.1 hours of work.

No, absolutely not.\n\nDo my emotions take over for a sec cause I\u2019m hangry and just wanted that goddamn sandwich?

Also our colleagues had the expectations that I would be as good as her at the job without the experience that she had which ended up with me being in sick leave for 6 months due to depression and stress (I was working full time and going to uni full time and my grandfather who was more like a father to me died around that time, it was a lot)", "For the future might I suggest the Subway app? With the app it is simply order, (so you get what you want) grab and go, or if yours offers delivery, you can go that route.

You have to clock out for a lunch, if I\u2019m scheduled a 12 hour shift, say, 6am to 6pm, and I want to take a 1 hour lunch, I have to clock out for 1 hour. Which means to earn 12 hours you have to stay 1 hour later than usual, 7pm. If you don\u2019t stay the extra hour and leave at 6pm, you only get paid for 11 hours.

I\u2019m in the Midwest and in my state we have nothing!
