My mom remarried right away but that marriage didn't last long. It took my father 3 years after the divorce to meet someone and another 2 years to marry my stepmother who I will refer as Claudia for the post.\n\nI wasn't happy when my father married Claudia as I was stuck in a fantasy world where my biological parents would still be together but I quickly learned to love Claudia and consider her family. She is a very sweet woman who has treated me very well ever since I met her. Claudia has a passion for baking. She bakes a lot whenever I'm around. I've eaten enough of her stuff to know I love her baking, especially her chocolate cake.Chocolate is actually my favorite flavor of cake.\n\nHowever, every time my birthday came up I couldn't get the chocolate cake I wanted since some people in my mom's family (including my mom) are allergic to chocolate. Every single birthday I'm stuck eating a mediocre cake in a flavor I don't like. I never complained about it since it would make my mom upset. It sucked to blow out the candles on a cake I don't want. My birthday is coming up in a week. My mom always plans out the party (without consulting me or my dad) and she texted me to tell that she had already pre-ordered a strawberry-vanilla cake and asked me to pick it up on my way to the party when the day comes.I became visibly upset as I would be forced to blow out the candles and eat a cake I don't want for the 15th year in a row. Claudia saw me get upset and asked me why. I said everything is fine but she responded in a slightly demanding voice once again asking why I was upset. I decided to open up and tell her about my frustration with every year eating a birthday cake I don't like and just wanting my own damn cake on my birthday.\n\nShe offered to bake me a small chocolate cake for myself that I could have on my birthday. She proposed that the candles be on that cake and the cake that my mom ordered have no candles but still be there for those who are allergic to chocolate. To me its a win-win situation. I get the cake I want and everyone else gets something that suits them. I was delighted at the idea and I decided to text my mom about it.Mom wasn't happy at the idea. She actually called me screaming at me for being ungrateful and call Claudia dirty names. I practically begged my mom to at least grant me this once. I know its just a cake but eating what I like on my birthday for once would make me so happy. My mom again said no. I decided to bluff and tell her that I could have two separate celebrations. 1 with my Dad and Claudia, and another with her and her family but that I wouldn't be blowing out the candles on the cake she ordered and that I'd invite my friends to my celebration not hers. She became even more upset and hung up. I decided to go ahead with the two celebrations idea.

Your mom's reaction is not about you, not about your cake preference, and not about your birthday, It's entirely about her feelings towards Claudia. She's letting her *personal* issues call the shots here. Honestly, it's weird to me that your *favorite* kind of cake is not the main to accommodate *some* food allergies. I would think you would have a chocolate \"main\" cake and then an alternative for those with allergies. I think your stepmom provided a reasonable solution to a problem that was upsetting you, and your mom is being completely UNreasonable about it.", "NTA.   Your mom has issues with Claudia, and she's taking them out on the nearest target, you.\n\nHave two parties.  It's a great idea.", "NTA. Now, I'm assuming that no one is so allergic that they can't be in a room with chocolate but that eating it would be an issue. If people were that allergic it would be a different discussion and you'd need to skip to the two party plan and wouldn't have bothered talking about having your cake at the first party. The party of the first part, as it were. \n\n\nMaybe you *should* just have one party. The one where you get the cake you want.", "**NTA** \\- good grief.  Or even just have one celebration - with your Dad and Claudia.  It doesn't sound like the other is going to be much of a celebration.  I guess Mom thinks the party is about her.", "NTA I don't think you ATA at all. You are 15, about to turn 16 and it's an important year. I think you are, as a teen, learning lessons about speaking up for yourself and what you want. In my opinion, your mother is the asshole. YOU should be put first, its your birthday FFS!\n\nGood on you OP for speaking up once Claudia pressed you. Sounds like you have a great stepmom.\n\nSometimes in life we find that our \"biological family\" aren't all they are cracked up to be, and aren't good for our mental health. And as we get older, we surround ourselves with people we **choose** to be in our lives, and they become our \"logical family\" (friends, stepparents, etc). Sounds to me like your Claudia fits into the latter- she's good to you and I'm glad you have her in your life.", "NTA. Your step-mom came up with the *perfect* solution for your birthday, and your mother reacted completely out of proportion to the whole situation. To be honest - you have no reason to be grateful for a cake that you don't like. Let's be honest here - your mother is ordering a cake flavor that *she* likes, not one that *you* like, and is expecting you to be grateful for it, as opposed to being understanding that you are accepting a flavor that you are simply accepting of because of other people's allergies.\n\nLike someone else said - your mother is not angry at a birthday cake. She is angry because she perceives that she is losing a contest that you were not aware you were in. After all, she plans your party every year without any input from you, and then along comes your step-mother who actually listens to you and lets you plan what you want - and your mother is losing power over you. And, let's face it, if there is a contest, screaming and throwing a tantrum isn't going to help her cause any.", "NTA.\n\nShe is being ridiculous.\n\nI think, though, she might be having a hard time with Claudia.  I'm not sure why your mom doesn't want you to get to have your own chocolate cake?  \n\nAt the moment though, It's possible that your mom might decide to cancel everything (I'm only guessing here - but that her feelings are hurt and she might have a jealousy problem and a control issue where she needs to be in control.)  Don't be surprised, though, if she doesn't have any cake whatsoever, and it could  get worse.\n\nHang in there and maybe you can call mom and start asking questions.  Your own dad might have some insight as to what's up with your mom since he knew her so closely all those years.\n\nMaybe give your mom a call and ask her to help you understand what the problem is.  Mom, I love you and I just want to understand, what am I not understanding here?  What am I missing?  I don't understand why this is a problem?", "NTA\n\nStep mom\u2019s solution was completely logical. Your mom is being ridiculous.", "NTA. I've been to many birthdays that had multiple cakes, multiple flavors, so that everyone could have their preferred flavor. It's a completely normal thing and your mom is starting drama for no reason.", "NTA I am so sorry your Mom did not listen to what you want. I would think cupcakes or smaller separate cakes are safe for those with allergies. I was allergic to eggs so I would just not eat it when I could not. I would not ask the birthday girl to get a cake without eggs because I could not eat it. So rude of them!", "NTA. It\u2019s your birthday, you should be able to eat your favorite cake. Having two cakes is not a problem, your mother is. You openly told her eating a chocolate cake would make you happy, you found a compromise that would not impact her vanilla cake but she\u2019s still unsatisfied and doesn\u2019t care about your happiness. She\u2019s the A.", "NTA\n\nShared birthdays and shared cakes suck.", "That is a marvelous idea!  Excellent problem solving.  Might I suggest the party with the chocolate cake happen BEFORE the party with the Les desirable cake?", "Definitely NTA! It's your birthday, you should enjoy the cake you love! Sounds like Claudia is supportive, plus it ensures everyone can still have cake. It's a win-win! Your mom needs to respect your wishes.", "Nta, its ur birthday you should get the cake YOU want not the one your mom wants", "NTA\n\nYour mom is putting you in the firing line of whatever her issue with Claudia is.\n\nYou don\u2019t deserve that, OP. Enjoy your cake - sounds delicious!", "NTA\n\nClaudia seems very nice. That is a great idea that respects everyone's wishes. Your mom seems very controlling and jealous. She's seeing you as some sort of possession/trophy to contend over with Claudia and your dad instead of as her son. You can tell her plainly you don't appreciate being treated as an accessory and see if she even realizes what she's doing is wrong.", "Cake tends to get everywhere so I would actually be a bit worried about your mom having an allergic reaction to the chocolate cake. But I think it makes sense for you to have your own personal chocolate cake, especially if it's made specially for you by someone who is a really good baker and who loves baking. Your mom is not doing a good job troubleshooting this problem. I can understand why she doesn't want to miss out on your birthday or have another woman take over the birthday planning, because it would make her feel sidelined as a mom. But a key part of birthday planning for your kids is that they should enjoy their birthday!!!! It seems to me a perfect solution is that you have your own chocolate cake with your dad and Claudia, so your mom isn't even present to have an allergic reaction. And then for your birthday party have a cake your mom can be around, so she can enjoy seeing you with your friends. Or, you could do the party first and then serve the (chocolate) cake last, your mom could take some pictures of you with the cake, and then head out when people start eating it, so she is not around when chocolate is being spread around the room.", "NTA. My spouse and I like different cakes, so on cake occasions, we have both chocolate and lemon cakes available. It's not a conflict situation at all.\n\nThere are things going on here that are not actually about cakes at all. These problems might not be yours to solve. Whatever is going on between your mother and stepmother, it would seem that Claudia cares more about who you are and what you want than your birth mother does. Take notes.", "I knew where this heading and your stepmother should have known how your mother was going to react. You either need to put your foot down and say I want the cake I want or suck it up and have a secret celebration later. This isn't about cake, it's about power and who can project it. Your mom isn't ready to give to share. You have to be strong and stand up for yourself. BtW the same thing happened to me. I refused to acknowledge the cake, cut it or even take a piece. Both parents were pissed but they got over it", "NTA but couldn\u2019t your mom order cupcakes - some chocolate & some whatever flavor they need to be? If she doesn\u2019t want the stepmom to do it & feel one upped it feels like cupcakes are the way to go.", "Claudia sounds lovely and it speaks well of you that you got past the understandable initial friction. Your mom sounds like a piece of work. Hope you get your cake somehow! NTA.", "NTA. You're just 15 and you want your chocolate cake! It's so normal. I don't understand why she can't get you a chocolate cake, and another for the rest. The solution that Claudia had is perfect and logical. And the one you had of the two parties, is great as well. \n\nProps to you, because you kept firm with your wish on having a chocolate cake. Talk to your mom, and tell her that you love her, but you just want your chocolate cake. Tell her that was your wish every year when you blown the candles.", "NTA.  It\u2019s your birthday and you should have the cake you want.  Two cakes is a. Ice compromise.", "NTA. Your mom clearly has problems.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is controlling. You don't have to celebrate your birthday with her family.", "NTA. Your mother is being ridiculous, she should be getting you the cake you want and providing an alternative for others, afterall it's your birthday and you can choose the cake you want.  This is what my family does.", "It\u2019s was always a tradition in our family for the birthday person to pick their own birthday cake flavor. Mine was German chocolate and my sister\u2019s was vanilla with chocolate frosting. The parents went with regular chocolate cakes.\n\nYour plan for two cakes is a perfect compromise. You get your cake and another cake is there for those allergic to chocolate. Why your mom has such a problem with this stems from far deeper issues than just a birthday cake.", "NTA what is your mom thinking? The birthday person gets their favorite cake, and another cake/cupcakes/dessert is bought for those who can't have the birthday cake. This is the normal logical way to handle this and it's insane that you've gone 15 years not doing it that way.", "NTA. Guess what, I hate chocolate, even the smell of it makes me physically ill, (I\u2019ve even been sick when someone tricked me by feeding me some chocolate) but I\u2019ve never prevented any of my children from having chocolate cake for their bdays. \n\nNot allowing you to have the cake you want die your birthday is just plain rude. Your Mom needs to apologize to you and your stepmom.", "Nta as a fellow chocolate addict I would never be ok with strawberry vanilla it's your birthday not theirs they don't have to eat it\n\nYour mom is just being a selfish witch she reminds me of my mom", "NTA\n\nIf her family has allergies, they get freaking cupcakes. You don't demand the birthday person have a cake they hate. \n\nGlad you got a good stepmom. I hope the chocolate cake is delicious. Mother is going to learn one way or another that she can no longer steamroll over everything and have it quietly tolerated.", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry kid. You deserve better.", "NTA... You were going to bring the cake you wanted to eat.", "Your mom is very controlling and manipulative! I have never known a \u2018mother\u2019 who gets a cake for herself and not the birthday person. How selfish can a person be? She should get the cake for you, then have other pastries for the \u2018allergic\u2019 guests! Your choices are to not go to her birthday party- (supposedly for you) , or go and not eat cake or go and tell her it is the last time. Time to have fun on your birthday.\nI wonder if any of your friends or paternal relatives are invited? Just asking!!", "NTA\n\nThis is 100% all about her. She doesn\u2019t even have to eat the cake so she should be fine\n\nI\u2019m also allergic to chocolate but it\u2019s my best friends favorite. I basically wore a makeshift hazmat suit to make her a triple chocolate cake for her birthday. Then I sat and watched everyone else eat it because it wasn\u2019t about me, it was about someone important *to me*. And that\u2019s what matters", "First it starts with cake.....What will she work her way up to next.  It's a dumb hill to die on.  She can go F herself on this one.  Or you could take some of that birthday money and go out and buy a small chocolate cake for yourself and just gorge yourself on it.", "NTA. You should have been having two celebrations for years. Enjoy your birthday. I mean your mom is kinda the reason for the season, but you give a kid the cake they want on their birthday. She shouldn't be this invested in making this decision for you.", "NTA. You could say it's a Covid or flu season precaution so no one gets sick.
