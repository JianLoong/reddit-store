I won\u2019t to go into too much detail, but his death was very sudden and rough. Afterwards, my mom became pretty distant from me and my little sister. We all had dual citizenship, and my mother basically moved back to our home country, leaving us in the care of family friends. I only saw her sporadically from that point on.\n\nAs a result, my wife (37F) does not like my mom. I\u2019ve tried to explain that she was just coping in her own way, but my wife refuses to give her the benefit of the doubt. She doesn\u2019t prevent me or our kids from having a relationship with my mom, but has made it clear that she has no desire to pursue one herself.\n\nRecently, I went back to my home country with the kids to see her. I explained to my mom that my wife couldn\u2019t come due to work and she seemed to understand.\n\nThe first few days of the trip went great, but tonight things went bad. After I put my kids to bed I went to have a drink with my mom and my aunt, who she lives with. As I was walking down the stairs I overheard my aunt say something about how my wife \u201cthinks she\u2019s too good for us.\u201d My mom agreed, referring to my wife as a snob, but warned my aunt not to bring it up to me.\n\nMy wife comes from a wealthy family. Her parents died when she was young and as she was an only child, they left everything to her. She\u2019s a smart woman and a hard worker, but she likes the finer things in life and isn\u2019t ashamed of that fact. In comparison, my family is solidly middle class and more down to earth. Obviously there\u2019s a class difference there, but my wife has never been rude to my mother regarding this topic.\n\nThis bothered me, and I demanded to know what my mom and aunt were saying. They clearly didn\u2019t expect me to hear any of it, and my mom became apologetic, bu my aunt said that my wife\u2019s refusal to interact with them is because she thinks she\u2019s better than them. I explained that isn\u2019t the case, but my aunt kept pushing the issue. Eventually my mom said it was fine if my wife felt that way, but I shouldn\u2019t defend her \u201cclassist behaviour.\u201d At this point I snapped and said that my wife resents my mom because she wasn\u2019t around when I was a kid. My mom and aunt didn\u2019t say anything to that, and I went back upstairs.\n\nI texted my sister about it and she said that I should just apologize, but she\u2019s always been less confrontational than me. I don\u2019t resent my mom for what she did when I was a kid and I feel bad for snapping at her, but the way she was speaking about my wife was upsetting, and it was clear she and my aunt had gossiped about her before. I probably could have handled it better but at that moment all I cared about was defending my wife. I don\u2019t want to apologize for that but I also know this won\u2019t blow over if I stick around, so I\u2019d probably have to go back home with the kids earlier than planned.

Your wife had a dramatically different experience with losing her parents versus having a parent choose to be absent. She has every right to not engage with your mom and was polite enough to not create extra drama. You were right to defend her to your family.", "NTA.\n\nThey pushed and wouldn't let it go or believe you at your word and they got what they demanded.  Truth hurts sometimes.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you don't resent her for it, it is the truth.  \n\n\nEDIT: You had your wife's back and that's the right thing to do.", "NTA.  You overheard comments about your wife which you knew to be untrue and you set the record straight.  It's interesting that you have been able to accept your mother's abandoning you and your sister after your father died.  It is inconceivable to imagine abandoning my children should my husband die and so I can totally relate to your wife's feelings there.  I'm glad you've managed to accept that since you really didn't have much choice, but for a mother to leave her children behind like that sounds pretty horrible to me.  Your wife is clearly not comfortable around your mother and maybe for good reason.  You were 100% right to defend your wife.", "NTA: I also really understand the psychology behind your wife's reaction. Your dad died when you were young and your mom basically gave you and your sister up - while she has neither parent left, making you a virtual orphan unnecessarily  and she can't deal with the idea of a mother who doesn't want to be there for her son. Unless her parents died together in an accident or tragedy, she still had one parent after the other for a little while.", "NTA - stand by the woman who has stood by you, your wife.", "NTA don\u2019t apologize. Your mom did something deeply traumatic to you and your sister and your wife (rightfully) can\u2019t accept your moms actions because she loves you. \nYour mom, on the other hand, is so delusional about her own choices that she can\u2019t see that her actions have shaped the relationships around her. \n\nI know you say you don\u2019t blame your mom and aren\u2019t hurt by her choice to abandon child you at your most vulnerable grief filled time (you lost your dad and then you lost your mom). But perhaps your willingness to forgive and forget without any consequences or discussion with your mom isn\u2019t healthy either. Therapy would be good. Your mom sounds like a narcissist", "NTA.\n\nYou just told them the truth. The fact that the truth hurts is not your fault.", "NTA - Thank you for defending your wife.", "NTA. Keep defending your wife. She did nothing wrong. Your mom and aunt are throwing dirt at your wife so they could feel clean. And your mother certainly isn't in this situation.", "NTA. Keep defending your wife. She did nothing wrong. Your mom and aunt are throwing dirt at your wife so they could feel clean. And your mother certainly isn't in this situation.", "If you feel bad for snapping at her, then apologize not for *what* you said, but the way you said it. Reiterate that the way they were gossiping about your wife was hurtful, unkind, and untrue. While you are sorry that you snapped, you will not apologize for defending your wife. \n\nNTA", "NTA. As tough as that situation is, it\u2019s nice for once in this sub of darkness to hear about a couple where both partners so clearly have each others\u2019 backs.", "NTA and your wife is right. She abandoned her children and left the country so she could cope with losing her husband. BS, she cut and ran and didn't give one little rats ass about her kids. She was only thinking of herself. You have nothing to apologize for. You had your wife's back and your mother is the one that needs to be apologizing for what she did to you and your sister.", "I have to ask, as much as you say you don\u2019t resent your mother for leaving, (she was going through a rough time, that\u2019s understandable) is it possible that you are being forgiving in spite of it actually affecting you more than you realize? After all, you were going through a hard time too, even if she was doing what she had to ti survive, that doesn\u2019t mean she did right by you. \n\nThe reason I ask is because when it comes to my own feelings, I\u2019m pretty quick to forgive, even if someone actually really hurt me.\n\nBut if you hurt someone I love? Even if they have forgiven you- if I see that little twinge of hurt in their eyes? Oh man.. you best believe I will become death riding on a pale horse just WAITING to unleash all hell behind me the second you step over the line.\n\nYou wife sounds like she might be the same way. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious she really loves and supports you, is it possible she sees the way your mother\u2019s actions affected you in a way that you don\u2019t see? And that she\u2019s kind enough to avoid your mother in order to keep from metaphorically strangling someone who hurt you? \n\nEither way, NTA, obviously. And I\u2019m very happy for you and your wife. You truly support each other and that\u2019s lovely. You are doing everything right in this situation.", "NTA but I\u2019m going to say both your mom, aunt, and wife are in a 3 way tie for being asses. Your mom and aunt - obvious. \n\nYou don\u2019t seem to resent your mom, and it\u2019s not your wife\u2019s place to decide your mom made an unforgivable mistake by abandoning you, for lack of a better word. Your wife, in this situation, should follow your lead. If she truly meant what she says, she wouldn\u2019t allow your children to visit your mother. So, something here kind of stinks. She should support you in the way YOU WANT to be supported, not the way she happens to decide that she feels like supporting you. I think you should have a new conversation with her bc it\u2019s causing you problems.", "NTA for defending your wife. \n\nBut as she's never around your mom, you cannot control how others think or speak about her, especially when you're not in earshot. \n\nActions speak louder than words. And unless your wife's behavior changes around your family, then your words are just words and carry little weight. Wife hasn't shown any indication of wanting to share the experience of your home country with her kids. That's half of who they are. What else can your family think?\n\nThat said. Your wife is entitled to maintain her boundaries.", "Im not defending your mother BUT wife being so righteous on behalf of another is no way to live. Whatever feelings she has about the situation needs to be tempered with empathy and realities of life. I am sorry for the feelings of abandonment you and siblings must have felt as children. And kudos for moving past the hurt and empathy you have for mums situation.", "ESH\u2014 \nYour wife\u2014 I just have no sympathy for when people do that \u201cthey were bad to you so you can have a relationship with them if you want to but I refuse!\u201d How does that help you? Sharing your sadness and frustrations about your mom with your wife doesn\u2019t mean she should make your relationship with them both even more complicated. I don\u2019t know why your mom left you\u2014 financial reasons? Depression?  Maybe she made made a good decision with the information she had at the time. \n\nYour mom\u2014 obviously your wife refusing to show is a slight, but calling her classist is unfair. Sometimes people see every preference that doesn\u2019t match theirs as a slight. If she accused her of being judgmental, I\u2019d say that sounds fair enough.\n\nYou\u2014 are most innocent in this but it does sound like you jumped down her throat. Of course she\u2019s going to speculate and it won\u2019t be generous.", "YTA. If the lil\u2019 inheritance girl is upset she can cry into a few Benjamins.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Especially from old gossips with no sense.", "NTA. Your wife clearly hates your mom for abandoning you at your time of need. For the sake of peace has distanced herself from your mother. Having wealth and liking finer things in life doesn't make her a snob. Your mother on the other hand seems more self centered and entitled.\n\nYou just set things straight with your mom thats all.", "NTA\n\nThey attacked your wife and you defended her", "NTA you were right to stand up for your wife. Honestly your mom should be a little ashamed. You had just lost your dad and then she abandoned you. Looks pretty bad. You may not hold it against her but it did help shape you into who you are good or bad. Your wife can\u2019t imagine herself ever abandoning her children. Perhaps your mother did it for you to have more opportunities but on the surface looks pretty bad but your mother shouldn\u2019t blame it on your wife. Perhaps your mom could write her a letter to help her understand but on the surface o would agree with your wofe", "NTA but your wife is an AH. She\u2019s judging and condemning your mom when it\u2019s not her place to do so. I let a lot of resentment towards my father go because I learned as a parent, we are human too. We screw up and we have our own struggles too. May father is an addict and completely absent from my life. It used to make me angry, but now I feel disappointment in him and see him as a human. His addiction has taken so much from his life and I hope one day he can get sober for himself. Our relationship may not ever be repaired but it would be nice knowing that he finally got sober. What happened between you and your mom is between you and your mom. Your wife is just making things difficult on you and your children.

I know I am very lucky to have her.", "She does support me, but I don't want her to feel forced into having a relationship with my mom.  I think that would cause more difficulties in the relationships than anything else.\n\nI also don't see why allowing our kids to see my mom is a bad thing? What my mom did was to me and my sister, not to my children, and my wife and I both think they deserve to have a relationship with their grandmother.", "She's not opposed to the idea of visiting my home country, and has done so in the past.

I asked her why she doesn't like my mom back when we were engaged and she said that was the reason, and her perspective hasn't changed since.", "I couldn't fit it in the post because of word limit but part of the reason she didn't come IS because of work. If my mom visited us or something then she wouldn't ignore her or refuse to let her enter or house or anything, she just doesn't want to go on a trip solely to see my mom when she knows things will just be tense and uncomfortable.", "I mean, sometimes, the only thing a person can do is say \"I was wrong\" and then try to move past it.  If she's not even willing to do that, then I can't entirely blame your wife.  Though yeah, if your mom had mental illness issues or the like, then she should come out and say so.   Perhaps she did do the best thing for you and your sister that she could, none of us but her knows.   \n\n\nBut the problem was that she kind of .... what's the word?  ...deflected her feelings onto your wife.  Made her the \"bad guy,\" and for a reason she apparently made up in her head, that's not cool at all.", "If your wife thought your mother was SO evil and unforgivable that she herself won\u2019t stoop to visit, then why would she allow her own innocent children to visit such a morally questionable individual?", "Sorry, self righteous wasnt the right word."]}
