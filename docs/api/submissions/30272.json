I won\u2019t to go into too much detail, but his death was very sudden and rough. Afterwards, my mom became pretty distant from me and my little sister. We all had dual citizenship, and my mother basically moved back to our home country, leaving us in the care of family friends. I only saw her sporadically from that point on.\n\nAs a result, my wife (37F) does not like my mom. I\u2019ve tried to explain that she was just coping in her own way, but my wife refuses to give her the benefit of the doubt. She doesn\u2019t prevent me or our kids from having a relationship with my mom, but has made it clear that she has no desire to pursue one herself.\n\nRecently, I went back to my home country with the kids to see her. I explained to my mom that my wife couldn\u2019t come due to work and she seemed to understand.\n\nThe first few days of the trip went great, but tonight things went bad. After I put my kids to bed I went to have a drink with my mom and my aunt, who she lives with. As I was walking down the stairs I overheard my aunt say something about how my wife \u201cthinks she\u2019s too good for us.\u201d My mom agreed, referring to my wife as a snob, but warned my aunt not to bring it up to me.\n\nMy wife comes from a wealthy family. Her parents died when she was young and as she was an only child, they left everything to her. She\u2019s a smart woman and a hard worker, but she likes the finer things in life and isn\u2019t ashamed of that fact. In comparison, my family is solidly middle class and more down to earth. Obviously there\u2019s a class difference there, but my wife has never been rude to my mother regarding this topic.\n\nThis bothered me, and I demanded to know what my mom and aunt were saying. They clearly didn\u2019t expect me to hear any of it, and my mom became apologetic, bu my aunt said that my wife\u2019s refusal to interact with them is because she thinks she\u2019s better than them. I explained that isn\u2019t the case, but my aunt kept pushing the issue. Eventually my mom said it was fine if my wife felt that way, but I shouldn\u2019t defend her \u201cclassist behaviour.\u201d At this point I snapped and said that my wife resents my mom because she wasn\u2019t around when I was a kid. My mom and aunt didn\u2019t say anything to that, and I went back upstairs.\n\nI texted my sister about it and she said that I should just apologize, but she\u2019s always been less confrontational than me. I don\u2019t resent my mom for what she did when I was a kid and I feel bad for snapping at her, but the way she was speaking about my wife was upsetting, and it was clear she and my aunt had gossiped about her before. I probably could have handled it better but at that moment all I cared about was defending my wife. I don\u2019t want to apologize for that but I also know this won\u2019t blow over if I stick around, so I\u2019d probably have to go back home with the kids earlier than planned.

Your wife had a dramatically different experience with losing her parents versus having a parent choose to be absent.

You were right to defend her to your family.", "NTA.\n\nThey pushed and wouldn't let it go or believe you at your word and they got what they demanded.  Truth hurts sometimes.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you don't resent her for it, it is the truth.  \n\n\nEDIT: You had your wife's back and that's the right thing to do.", "NTA.  You overheard comments about your wife which you knew to be untrue and you set the record straight.  It's interesting that you have been able to accept your mother's abandoning you and your sister after your father died.  It is inconceivable to imagine abandoning my children should my husband die and so I can totally relate to your wife's feelings there.  I'm glad you've managed to accept that since you really didn't have much choice, but for a mother to leave her children behind like that sounds pretty horrible to me.  Your wife is clearly not comfortable around your mother and maybe for good reason.  You were 100% right to defend your wife.", "NTA: I also really understand the psychology behind your wife's reaction. Your dad died when you were young and your mom basically gave you and your sister up - while she has neither parent left, making you a virtual orphan unnecessarily  and she can't deal with the idea of a mother who doesn't want to be there for her son. Unless her parents died together in an accident or tragedy, she still had one parent after the other for a little while.", "NTA - stand by the woman who has stood by you, your wife.", "NTA don\u2019t apologize. Your mom did something deeply traumatic to you and your sister and your wife (rightfully) can\u2019t accept your moms actions because she loves you. \nYour mom, on the other hand, is so delusional about her own choices that she can\u2019t see that her actions have shaped the relationships around her. \n\nI know you say you don\u2019t blame your mom and aren\u2019t hurt by her choice to abandon child you at your most vulnerable grief filled time (you lost your dad and then you lost your mom). But perhaps your willingness to forgive and forget without any consequences or discussion with your mom isn\u2019t healthy either. Therapy would be good. Your mom sounds like a narcissist", "NTA.\n\nYou just told them the truth. The fact that the truth hurts is not your fault.", "NTA - Thank you for defending your wife.", "NTA. Keep defending your wife. She did nothing wrong. Your mom and aunt are throwing dirt at your wife so they could feel clean. And your mother certainly isn't in this situation.", "NTA. Keep defending your wife. She did nothing wrong. Your mom and aunt are throwing dirt at your wife so they could feel clean. And your mother certainly isn't in this situation.", "If you feel bad for snapping at her, then apologize not for *what* you said, but the way you said it. Reiterate that the way they were gossiping about your wife was hurtful, unkind, and untrue. While you are sorry that you snapped, you will not apologize for defending your wife. \n\nNTA", "NTA. As tough as that situation is, it\u2019s nice for once in this sub of darkness to hear about a couple where both partners so clearly have each others\u2019 backs.", "NTA and your wife is right. She abandoned her children and left the country so she could cope with losing her husband. BS, she cut and ran and didn't give one little rats ass about her kids. She was only thinking of herself. You have nothing to apologize for. You had your wife's back and your mother is the one that needs to be apologizing for what she did to you and your sister.", "I have to ask, as much as you say you don\u2019t resent your mother for leaving, (she was going through a rough time, that\u2019s understandable) is it possible that you are being forgiving in spite of it actually affecting you more than you realize? After all, you were going through a hard time too, even if she was doing what she had to ti survive, that doesn\u2019t mean she did right by you. \n\nThe reason I ask is because when it comes to my own feelings, I\u2019m pretty quick to forgive, even if someone actually really hurt me.\n\nBut if you hurt someone I love? Even if they have forgiven you- if I see that little twinge of hurt in their eyes? Oh man.. you best believe I will become death riding on a pale horse just WAITING to unleash all hell behind me the second you step over the line.\n\nYou wife sounds like she might be the same way. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious she really loves and supports you, is it possible she sees the way your mother\u2019s actions affected you in a way that you don\u2019t see? And that she\u2019s kind enough to avoid your mother in order to keep from metaphorically strangling someone who hurt you? \n\nEither way, NTA, obviously. And I\u2019m very happy for you and your wife. You truly support each other and that\u2019s lovely. You are doing everything right in this situation.", "NTA but I\u2019m going to say both your mom, aunt, and wife are in a 3 way tie for being asses. Your mom and aunt - obvious. \n\nYou don\u2019t seem to resent your mom, and it\u2019s not your wife\u2019s place to decide your mom made an unforgivable mistake by abandoning you, for lack of a better word. Your wife, in this situation, should follow your lead. If she truly meant what she says, she wouldn\u2019t allow your children to visit your mother. So, something here kind of stinks. She should support you in the way YOU WANT to be supported, not the way she happens to decide that she feels like supporting you. I think you should have a new conversation with her bc it\u2019s causing you problems.", "NTA for defending your wife. \n\nBut as she's never around your mom, you cannot control how others think or speak about her, especially when you're not in earshot. \n\nActions speak louder than words. And unless your wife's behavior changes around your family, then your words are just words and carry little weight. Wife hasn't shown any indication of wanting to share the experience of your home country with her kids. That's half of who they are. What else can your family think?\n\nThat said. Your wife is entitled to maintain her boundaries.", "Im not defending your mother BUT wife being so righteous on behalf of another is no way to live. Whatever feelings she has about the situation needs to be tempered with empathy and realities of life. I am sorry for the feelings of abandonment you and siblings must have felt as children. And kudos for moving past the hurt and empathy you have for mums situation.", "ESH\u2014 \nYour wife\u2014 I just have no sympathy for when people do that \u201cthey were bad to you so you can have a relationship with them if you want to but I refuse!\u201d How does that help you? Sharing your sadness and frustrations about your mom with your wife doesn\u2019t mean she should make your relationship with them both even more complicated. I don\u2019t know why your mom left you\u2014 financial reasons? Depression?  Maybe she made made a good decision with the information she had at the time. \n\nYour mom\u2014 obviously your wife refusing to show is a slight, but calling her classist is unfair. Sometimes people see every preference that doesn\u2019t match theirs as a slight. If she accused her of being judgmental, I\u2019d say that sounds fair enough.\n\nYou\u2014 are most innocent in this but it does sound like you jumped down her throat.

Most people would resent that.\n\nDid she ever say sorry to you for that? For \"coping\" by abandoning you while she ran off to another country?\n\nNTA.", "Nta. If i was in your wife's place then i would have done the same. Why is she doing what she is doing? Because she loves you. And she loves you enough to know that even after all your mom had done, you still love her . She doesnt come to your mom's home because 1) she might be not used to middle class living and doesnt want to embarass you or your mom 2) (the most likely one) she knows she will snap ane say something infront of your mom. She has no problem with you or your kids having a relationship with your mom because , you seem to be happy. Your mom seems to be apologetic. Thats a good sign. And yes , you did the right thing by telling her the truth. I dont blame your mom for saying that \"wife is a snob \" and all. The older generation of middle class people view the upper class just like this. Mom kind of feels sad that your wife never visits, and maybe knows that it is partly her fault. She doesnt have a better way to communicate, and maybe because of being the elder one thinks that she should not. Aunt is trying to comfort mom because ,well, thats her sister. You are not the ah for saying what you said, because it needed to be said. But since op, you are wise enough to understand and forgive your mom for what she did, forgive her for this comment too. From this post, it seems like everyone is trying their best.", "I have to disagree. The wife has chosen not to share her feelings with her MIL. OP decided to tell his mom without his wife's permission. I'd be angry if I was his wife. I would never share my husband's feelings without his consent.", "[removed]", "I am with OPs wife. IDK why OP wants to have a relationship with this woman. She gave birth to him but she is not his mother.", "I feel like I\u2019m in bizarro world with all of these responses. The wife here is an AH. What a shitty way to treat her husband. The mom made an extremely difficult decision that she probably felt was the best thing for her children. Now she still has a relationship with those children decades later. It is not the wife\u2019s place to look down on her MIL. Which IS what she is doing. Her hangups about losing her parents have fuck all to do with her husband\u2019s family situation.", "She has every right to judge a woman who put her own needs above that of her children.\n\nSame as I have every right to judge that your dad was a crap parent.", "Don't apologize just to keep the peace unless you are prepared to become a doormat.\n\nYour mom did you wrong when you were a child, no matter the reason, and she has never apologized, and she feels entitled to judge others. Be careful that she doesn't poison your children against your wife.\n\nNTA.", "Another dead parents club member.\n\nYou're NTA.\n\nI do not want to imagine losing my spouse. I don't have kids. If I did it would be worse. \n\nBut in either scenario we have to adult. If we have kids we have to help and be there for them. Shutting down is a common response. But it's the wrong one. She abandoned you. You fixed the relationship, but because of that maybe she doesn't see the harm that was caused. Because you turned 'okay.'\n\nTalk to her. Let her know what 10, 11, 12, 18, 25, 38 year old felt like because of this. She'll maybe share the guilt she's had, if she had any. Maybe get some family counseling.", "Another orphan here. Instead of flying home early, maybe use this to finally talk to her about everything that happened? Seems it was never done. It\u2019s great you understand the situation was complex and seemingly too hard to handle for your mother, maybe there were other pressures that pushed her to abandon her, maybe there wasn\u2019t but you have to talk about it and you deserve to get her to hear how all of this has affected you over the years. It must have been awful to lose a parent and then the other even though they were still alive, your mom needs to hear it and get that if she ever complains about your wife, who has lost her 2 parents very definitively and would have traded her inheritance for a few more years with them, again, you and the kids are out", "Do you sometimes feel like you have to tiptoe around your mum's feelings because she's already proven herself to be unreliable and you fear her abandoning you again? It sounds like your sister may feel this way.\n\nIf so, that's even more proof that your wife is right and you made the right choice here.", ">so I don\u2019t bring it up\n\nBring it up dude. It\u2019s the biggest elephant in the room and it\u2019s been there for years. \n\nDon\u2019t repress this trauma until it becomes a tumor.", "Honestly OP you need to do some introspection about this than what your mother feels because you just got a glimpse of her true nature\u2026this incident showed how she turned everything into about her\u2026she is a mother who prioritized herself over her children (you) and left\u2026did she apologize for it? Or ever express remorse or anything at all? Her lack of empathy for you as a child speaks volumes\u2026your wife is showing what empathy really means when she cannot accept your mothers treatment of you\u2026think about if this is the sort of person your children needs to have a relationship with\u2026relationship for the sake of a relationship can be poisoneous", "ever gotten an apology?", "Same. OP is NTA, and far more generous with their forgiveness than I would be.", "Projection", "Yeah, it\u2019s great OP doesn\u2019t resent her and understand feelings and situations are complex and folks deal with them differently, but if you\u2019ve never talked about that together for 20 years, that\u2019s pretty unhealthy. My dad died when I was a kid and the adults around me had different reactions that I couldn\u2019t fully understand back then but we\u2019ve talked! I got to see their perspectives, in some cases, it mellowed my opinion of them, in others, far from it but at least it\u2019s all out in the open and much easier that way"]}
