I could keep going, but I think I've made my point.\n\nIt sounds like he can dish it out, but he can't take it.", "NTA.  It's almost exactly the same and not sure why he doesn't see it.

NTA in the slightest and that is by far a much funnier story than the one about you and your sister! KUDOS to you for finding a way to throw it back at him.

One time, I turned it around and basically said the same thing back to him. Then it was all, \"That was so rude. Why would you say that to me?\" I told him I didn't actually mean it, but that was what he said to me and how I felt. He still didn't believe me. \n\nYour cousin is just freaking out because he is the subject of the story. They are practically the same story except he ate the poop instead of just throwing up from the smell. NTA", "NTA, it\u2019s only fair if he wants to embarrass you against your wish.", "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA that\u2019s an even funnier story. Tell that story at his sons wedding. I don\u2019t understand why he got so mad and bent out of shape if he thinks sharing your embarrassing story is just fine. Personally I don\u2019t see the problem in sharing either story. But that\u2019s not the point here. The point is you don\u2019t want that story to be shared so he should just not share it. You\u2019re not an asshole for not wanting it told at your sisters wedding especially if she also doesn\u2019t want it shared on her day. I sincerely hope that if he shares that story you share his as well. The poop sample story will certainly get more laughs. If you\u2019re worried about relationships being destroyed if you share the story just leave out the part about him looking like he was going to throw the baby so he can\u2019t accuse you of \u201ctrying to make him look bad\u201d it\u2019s not like he purposely tasted baby poop because he wanted to, it was a hilarious accident and I think that story should also be part of family legend. Anyway NTA. I too have a funny baby poop story I\u2019ll be vague about it though because the details make it less funny. There was a child that my grandma was babysitting and this child had a blow out diaper I was only about 8 maybe 9 or 10 not too sure anyway this child\u2019s diaper was horrific so I was trying to change it but I never changed a diaper before I saw it be done before but never actually really paid attention. So I get one side of the diaper undone but like I said it was a blow out so I got some on my hand and instantly had to vomit so I ran to the bathroom so I wouldn\u2019t make a mess\u2026 well I came back and the baby was gone! And so was the half removed diaper.. the child got the diaper off and smeared it on themselves along with smearing it other places too. I was surrounded by shit! I was trying to clean the baby off while holding back gags before they got anymore anywhere else and I accidentally sprayed some vomit on the poor baby. I did not ever change another diaper in my whole entire life until I had my own baby. Why adults think young kids can change shitty diapers is beyond me. One time I asked my son to throw away a diaper for me (it just had pee in it and it didn\u2019t smell or anything) and that boy started gagging before he even grabbed it. One of my favorite story\u2019s is my son spitting up into my uncles mouth it was awful and everyone that saw it gagged or vomited but boy was it hilarious! That was one of his favorite story\u2019s to tell. If it ever got brought up he had to be the one to tell the whole story. I wish he was still around so he could share that story at my sons wedding one day.", "NTA", "NTA.  It is the same.  He can't take being the butt of the joke but wants to tell the same jokes on other people.

Ewww..gross. \n\n  Anyway NTA. Since so many people don't know, what a better chance than to share a cute story about a new father and his baby comparing to the old story everybody has already heard. I wouldnt really say the story if he went on with it, because it would feel to me like a competition to be more petty and gross, but I surely wouldn't let him guilt trip me, and I would threaten to tell on him. Not so much for saving me and my sister the embarrassment but out of annoyance for his hypocrisy", "NTA. It\u2019s not uncommon to get a gag reflex going when you\u2018re dealing with baby poop. For someone not accustomed to the sight or smell, the chances of it happening are much higher. Tit for tat. He tells the story you don\u2019t want told, and he does anyway, all bets are off. Old saying\u2026.\u201d Don\u2019t dish it, if you can\u2019t take it\u201d. Most people aren\u2019t going to just sit there, under attack without retaliation. You saved BIL\u2019s dignity once, not mentioning the poop/ mustard incident. Now, both of you are acting like children. Just avoid BIL at the party if you can. Make small talk. Play nice, I suppose.

Especially my youngest sister, it got to the point where I would try to stop my parents from disciplining her, and I would comfort her every time she got in trouble. I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m the reason she grew up a bit spoilt was because I always gave into her lol", "Yet everyone is encouraging OP to do the same to their cousin? They both threw up from baby shit, baby shit is gross, it\u2019s not that deep. Both stories are funny as hell.", "Especially if it made my sibling uncomfortable.", "Also, there's a difference between a ten year old being grossed out by poop and an adult and father of a baby mistaking baby poop for mustard.", "How does that make OP an asshole?", "What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander in that case. Cousin is a Hypocrite and should not be such a jerk.", "He licked up a mystery off his body while also near a baby! Excellent decision making \ud83d\ude02", "I actually laughed out loud at that.", "I agree he is a hypocrite. If we are using idioms, an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. If him telling OPs story is so bad then OP telling the cousins story would be just as bad. Personally I think both stories need to be shared with the world, gave me a good laugh.", "Why, thank you!", "I disagree. OP is merely reacting to cousin. And if I ask someone to not share a story, they darn well better not tell it. I don\u2019t care what the story is. It\u2019s my story. Just like this is OPs and his sisters and his cousin is doing it strictly to embarrass him where OP is only trying to scare him off of being a jerk.", "What\u2019s your annual pearl budget? I imagine they tend to wear out from getting so thoroughly clutched.", "They actually don't because caring about the safety of children is actually SUPER easy. Try it sometime :)", "NTA. You are a legend. Your little sister has the best big brother ever.", "Fight      \ud83d\udd25 with      \ud83d\udd25\n\nNTA, OP.  If he wants you to feel uncomfortable, he can feel it, too.  He sounds awful to spend time with.", "NTA.\n\nAll's fair in love and puke.", "Your cousin is the AH. Both stories are funny. He shouldn\u2019t dish it out if he can\u2019t take it!", "NTA", "NTA\nYour cousin is a jerk", "His story is much worse than yours and very funny. And gross.", "Another fuck around and find out. \n\nNTA", "Major NTA and you should seriously run for Prom King of r/AmITheAsshole!! Wonderfully done, sir!!!\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "NTA. You are an evil genius. :)", "Fun stops when you give a gun to the rabbit.", "My wife said the sister doesn't want that shit at her wedding.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Blackmail is such an ugly word. This is a case of   F*ck around and find out. Luckily he found out before the case went to trial.", "Also be careful that your older cousin doesn't get someone else to tell the story, so he can say that it wasn't him who told it. NTA", "NTA. He was being a jerk.", "Family meal-\nCousin: Did you hear about when OP\u2026.\nOP: Can someone pass the mustard?\nCousin: \u2026Nvm.", "\ud83e\udd2e\ud83d\ude06", "NTA.  He thinks it\u2019s hilarious to embarrass you, but is shocked that you would basically do the exact same thing?  Dude needs a bit of introspection.", "NTA, just a good brother.", "NTA.  Good call really.", "NTA. Nice move.", "NTA! But you should have told your cousin \"What are you talking about? I was there. It was hilarious!\"", "NTA - shit for shat.", "NTA.  Sometimes you gotta keep people in check. Good move.", "NTA. I think its even fit in Malicious compliance lol", "NTA. Make sure that everyone knows from now on!", "I'm sorry but I'm dying at the story. When you said he almost threw his kid over the picnic table I thought he tripped with his kid, not ate literal shit. That is legendary, not getting puked on is merely a tall tale. NTA", "NTA. That's hilarious.", ">He started yelling and saying that it wasn\u2019t the same\n\nHe\u2019s delusional. It is absolutely the same. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIf it wouldn't cause drama at the wedding, I'd so want you to just let him tell the story, and then you could, in turn, tell the much more horrifying story. Petty petty joy. \n\nI think I speak for us all when I say, we want video.", "NTA, Ole' Pooplicker had it coming.", "Naw NAH, personally I\u2019d let him tell his story so you can tell yours. Like he said, almost everyone know the story about you and your sister, but his mustard story\u2026.", "Nope. Fair play.", "I prefer extortion \n\nThe X makes it cool", "Oh for god\u2019s sake. Because family helps each other out. Maybe parents were doing something for 10 year old, or their 90 year old parents, or a neighbor. Maybe the parents were being people rather than resource drains who only think of themselves. \n\nThis whole \u2018if A child us asked to do anything at home, it\u2019s parentification\u2019 BS needs to stop. It\u2019s embarrsssing.", "Maybe carry some mustard packets with you\u2026leave them around his house\u2026in his car\u2026really show him whose in charge here.", "Ok not related to the thread but your story makes me think about something hilarious that happened to me.\n\nWe rescued a kitten in the spring and he had the worst gas. Worse than any baby or puppy I've ever dealt with. Well it was a thing where he'd fart on one of us and the other would laugh. Well one day I was sitting on the bed when that happened to my partner, so when I started to laugh he tossed the kitten onto the bed next to me, where the kitten farted again.\n\nWe like to giggle about the furry stink grenade he threw at me. And in case anyone is worried, it was a gentle toss onto a bed. The cat was and is totally fine. And he's no longer so gassy, thankfully."]}
