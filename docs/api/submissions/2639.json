I say it's gross and not appropriate and that it is embarrassing to me and my sister.  He said it's part of family legend and everyone will think it's funny.  \n\nSo fine I agree.  Then I mentioned the time that he almost threw his baby son over a picnic table.  He was holding his son and making himself a sandwich when he noticed that he had mustard on his arm.  So he licked it off.  It wasn't mustard.  Baby poop is weird.  I had to take the baby because he literally was looking like he was going to chuck the kid.  Then he went over to a tree and threw up for about five minutes. We told everyone there that it was food poisoning. \n\nHe started yelling and saying that it wasn't the same and that I am an ass for threatening to bring that up and that lots of people don't know.  Yeah lots of people don't know because I kept my mouth shut.  \n\nSo am I the Asshole for threatening reciprocity?", "created_utc": 1668783331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yym0re/aita_for_blackmailing_my_cousins_into_not_telling/", "score": 304, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Something that happened 20 years ago, or more, where she was the \"victim\" of someone else's mistake (nothing serious or criminal). Personally, I wouldn't be embarrassed by it at all.  But she is, and I never tell it, because she asked me not to. But to this day, my parents insist on telling it, despite her visible discomfort and her having asked them multiple times to stop.  I do my best to deflect/interrupt, but it doesn't always help.\n\nI was her \"man of honor\" at her wedding, and her only request for my speech was \"please don't be mean.\"  I felt so bad about that, not because I was planning on being mean (funny, yes, mean, no), but that she was clearly thinking of that, and other times when people insisted on telling stories she hated.", "NTA - neither story is funny in the least!  your cousin is the ahole for sure.  \n\nSadly, i suspect that you will be forever dealing with his juvenile attitude even though he is a father!!

Embrace them. Funny stories make you more relatable. You're not perfect, don't pretend that you are. Showing that you're human makes you more likable.", "NTA family will find your story just as funny", "This is EXACTLY the situation for which the expression \"Fuck around and find out\" was coined.

Its one thing in private and in your own company.  But a wedding is where a *just a bit of decorum* is expected.  Save your shitty stories for yourselves.  Dont subject your weddng guests to this.\n\nThat being said, if you want to use blackmail to convince your cousin to not tell a story, that is understandable.  But if your cousin does, dont stoop down to his level and be the second asshole at a wedding telling a poop story.
