He responded to say that it wasn\u2019t a big deal because he already knew what it was. I told him that just because he knows what it is, he should still wait for Christmas to look at it when he unwraps it.

Pretty rude imo, I don't understand how anyone would be fine with continuous disrespect. \n\nI am petty, I would not put up with that crap. I would personally return every single gift that got opened, because it was opened before the addressee got to it so it \"might have been damaged or mishandled in transport\" as you weren't the one to open it. Return every single one, get your money back, and then buy just one item and set the delivery for the day after Christmas. If he wasn't so disrespectful and nosy he would have had something to open the day of, but instead you had to send out for a new gift and that meant waiting for the new one to arrive. Kinda disappointing, but that's what happens if you don't appreciate the hard work people put in for you.", "NTA. Everyone in my house knows not to open packages with someone else's name on them.
