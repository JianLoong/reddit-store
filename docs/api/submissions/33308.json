Opening someone else's mail is a crime.\n\nThis whole thread is blowing my mind because in my family you simply do not open anything addressed to someone else without their permission.", "A remote car starter would be worth all the hype to me. That sounds like an A+++ Christmas gift.", "He says he\u2019s not good at it? Well he just needs practice! Get him a few empty boxes to wrap to work his way up to real gifts with. Bet he\u2019s going to start getting better once he registers that he is doing a lot of labor during \u201cpractice\u201d that won\u2019t have an impact in getting the job done!", "Next year just put the Amazon boxes under the tree, lol. They're technically wrapped up in an Amazon box after all. \n\nYou're absolutely NTA", "You\u2019re right.\n\n~~She should divorce him right now.~~\n\nEdit to change:\n\nShe should first tell him he ruined x mas and then divorce him right after.", "I would go further and boycott buying ANY gifts for his family. Why OP is wrapping ALL the presents why hubby does zero is BS.", "Or: every item he opens gets returned an replaced with an item lower on the list of reasonable", "OP lives with him, a glitter bomb would be self harm", "Thank you!! Keep it in mind for next year ;)", "This would also depend. That ONLY applies if it is handled by USPS. If UPS, Amazon, FedEx, etc deliver, it is not \"mail\" it is a \"parcel\" and does not have federal protection.", "You must be the immature husband! Notice how you\u2019re the only one even remotely defending him? That\u2019s usually a pretty good hint that your take is the wrong one \u263a\ufe0f", "I considered that but couldn\u2019t decide if it would be worth it", "Give him a new surprise -- return the gifts.", "No I\u2019m the wife.\n\nGuess I have a different perspective.\n\nBut anyways - off with his head! Of course"]}
