I can still do moderate exercise and run errands but mostly I'm meant to be sitting with my feet up all day so I don't get sick again.\n\nMy doctor okay-ed me to continue doing my mile-walks so my mom and I went up to our local park that has a walking path. She drove her car.\n\nWe got about 1/8 mile from the car and I mentioned thinking of changing the name I'd picked for the baby. Its been a point of consternation between she and I. I had settled on a name but in the last couple weeks it began to feel like the wrong name. I've been trying out a few names. She's frustrated by my inability to pick one.\n\nAnyway, I mentioned this wanting to change the name and she had a visceral reaction. She growled, threw her hands in the air, yelled a curse, and turned around and started storming off. I didn't realize what she was doing so I just stood there and watched. I thought she was going to turn and come baback. Instead she stormed to the car, got in, and drove away. Even if I had realize what she was doing I couldn't have caught up with her, I can only waddle these days.\n\nI walked back to the parking lot thinking she was coming back and just messing with me but five minutes passed and she was still gone. My leggings don't have pockets so I didn't have my cellphone with me.\n\nI went inside the community center and fortunately there were some ladies setting up for something and I asked if I could borrow a cellphone. I figured my mom wouldn't answer so I called my grandfather, who lives 10 minutes from the park. He said he'd be right there to get me. \n\nAbout the time my granddad parked my mom pulled back into the lot. She asked me why I called my grandfather instead of her and I told her that she left me in a park, without a cellphone so I borrowed someone's and called the only number I had memorized that I knew would pick me up.\n\nMom told my granddad she was sorry we'd bothered him and that she'd take me home. I told her I wasn't getting in the car with her and she was crazy if she thought I was. She asked why and I told her, \"you left your 8.5 month high-risk pregnant child in a park without a cellphone on an 85 degree F day, over something as stupid as naming a baby that isn't even due for another 7 weeks. She won't even know her own name for months, it literally doesn't even matter yet, but you let it become a whole drama.\"\n\nMy granddad drove me home. He gave my mom a stern talking-to when we got there.\n\nMom is now walking around acting like she's the victim because I embarrassed her. She said I should have just got in the car with her. She's only offered a half-assed apology but it was more of a, \"sorry you feel the way you do\" apology and not a real one.\n\nShe says I'm overreacting. I'm writing this with the intent of showing her so I'll accept whatever judgement comes my way. If I overreacted I want to know it.\n\nEdit: she didn't know I didn't have my phone.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683485417, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13az5c4/aita_for_refusing_to_get_in_the_car_with_my_mom/", "score": 522, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

LEt her find out the namer you chose after giving birth. It does not concer her, she does not get a vote.", "NTA. Your grandfather\u2019s right.", "NTA, of course. She put you in a potentially dangerous situation over something very petty. Even if you weren\u2019t pregnant, it\u2019s ridiculous to abandon someone in a parking lot without means of communication. You have every right to choose someone you\u2019re more comfortable with to drive you home, especially as he was already there and you could both use some space from each other.", "NTA. She embarrassed herself. If this was just a weird one-off, no big deal. But if your mother has ongoing issues with controlling her temper over minor things then you'll want to think about how to structure the relationship between your daughter and your mother.", "That level of temper tantrum would be extreme for a toddler, let alone an adult in charge of a car.  Honestly even if you had declared the name of your baby to be snuffy mcfluffable butt, this reaction would be extreme.\n\nThen on top of that, abandoning a heavily pregnant woman, who is high risk is unforgivable.\n\nYou are NTA, but I fear that the tantrum from your mother are doing to get worse once your little one arrives.  I think she may be a very demanding attention seeking grandma. I would worry about your baby being alone with her", "NTA.\n\nYour mom seems to care more about her own minor frustrations than your safety. And her unwillingness to accept responsibility is really concerning. Do I understand right that you live together? If you get to a point where you can change that, you should probably consider it.", "NTA\n\nYou're the parent. You name your baby whatever you want and the appropriate response is always \"that's beautiful, how do you spell it?\" even if you didn't pick real letters. \n\nYour mom is an adult and she can do whatever it is she needs to manage her own emotions. If people don't feel safe getting in the car with someone having a temper tantrum over a name, then she can not do that.\n\nYou're her daughter? she's named babies. She's had her fun. This is your baby.", "NTA. I honestly don\u2019t know what to say about your mom. I\u2019m 55 so I\u2019m guessing close to her age. Even on my worst hormonal day, I can\u2019t imagine my daughter doing anything frustrating enough that I would get in my car and take off. Let alone if she were 8.5 months pregnant (hi risk or not). Maybe a mother daughter therapy session would help? If she has been a good mom up til this point I doubt you\u2019d want to lose that relationship and for your baby a relationship with their grandmother. Sounds like something else was bothering her that she didn\u2019t share with you but I truly feel you deserve a very sincere apology. If she can\u2019t do that I might have different advice.", "NTA, absolutely. Does she need to be reminded that she is not actually the baby here? She threw an actual temper tantrum over virtually nothing and actively chose to put the well-being of you and your baby (that she is apparently so desperate to have named..?) at risk in the process. That behavior is somewhere between absurd and disturbing, with a side of WTF.\n\nAs an aside, it's probably a good idea to try to keep your cell phone on you whenever possible while being high-risk healthwise. I have a bunch of health issues and basically live in leggings with pockets. I take my phone everywhere (even inside my house) in case something happens. This isn't meant to blame you in any way (soooo NTA) or give unsolicited advice, it's just not something many people think about so I wanted to throw it out there. I wish you the best of health and I hope your mother joins us in reality.", ">\"you left your 8.5 month high-risk pregnant child in a park without a cellphone on an 85 degree F day, over something as stupid as naming a baby...\"\n\nThis says it all right here.  It doesn't matter if she didn't know you were without a cellphone, she left you and you had no idea of what her intentions were.  The stress of that alone was enough.  Then you had to waddle up to strangers to get help.  How awful is that?  Your mom should be ashamed of herself.  NTA", "NTA, hopefully things will settle down with her once the baby's born.", "NTA\nI\u2019m glad your grandfather stood up for you", "NTA!  You shared your story and there's no way you are TA.  None at all.  Your mom's TA.  Period.  I'm sorry that happened to you.  Maybe don't discuss names with her any more?  Best of luck to you and your baby!", "NTA What the fuck? There is so much wrong with what she did, I don\u2019t even have the words for it. There is NO excuse for what she did. Also, it\u2019s absolutely none of her business how much you waffle on a name. It\u2019s YOUR baby, not hers.", "NTA at all. It's one thing for her to feel frustrated by hearing about indecision, if you've brought it up repeatedly; however, her conduct here was completely unacceptable, even for going overboard. The playing victim is, as well--she should feel embarrassed, but it's her own fault as the perpetrator, not a victim. Calling your grandfather and accepting only a ride from him sounds like the only rational choice you had here--who knows at what point during a ride home with your mother that she would have pulled over and demanded that you get out and walk. Lastly, not having the cellphone, of course, doesn't make you TA, but keep it on your person at all times until the baby's born--\"too far\" can be a table in the same room, if you're writhing on the floor in pain.", "Talk about overreacting!  Your mother takes the prize.  Growling, cursing, and ditching you because you brought up baby naming?  If after that, she told me sorry you feel that way, I'd ask her if she is sorry I think she is a raving lunatic who I don't even want near me for the next month or so.  You are NTA.", "NTA. Someone debating baby names is not something anyone should be that pissed off about. Maybe if you were changing names after baby was born I could understand it, but with 7 weeks to go, it's such a stupid thing to be annoyed with. \n\nI chose a name, had my heart set on it, baby was born and looked nothing like the name I chose so I had to change names *quick* \ud83d\ude02 Babies do not adhere to our plans! \n\nStorming out of the room isn't going to risk the wellbeing of who you're storming away from. Abandoning a clinically vulnerable person is just a shitty thing to do. \n\nGood luck with the rest of your pregnancy, keep your feet up and stay away from drama mama \ud83d\ude02\u2764\ufe0f", "Do you live with her? This is unhealthy. \n\nThis is your baby. Also your baby to name. Why does she get an opinion? You need some boundaries. She left you in a park on an85 degree day and just expected you to be there waiting when she decided you should be picked up. This is nonsense. \n\nNTA. \n\nBut\u2026.set some boundaries or you will be TA because without them, you are asking for more of this.", "NTA.", "NTA! i\u2019m currently 31+3 rn and while i\u2019m no where near high risk the thought of someone i trust abandoning me in the hot weather makes my blood boil. especially over something so small as the name? op your mom is crazy i\u2019d be very careful around her and definitely don\u2019t go anywhere alone again unless you\u2019re driving.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom has a short fuse. We didn\u2019t settle on a name until we were in the delivery room - and gave everyone a different name every week until then. My husband told my very Catholic grandmother that we were naming our son after Pope Innocent, and even she never got this mad.", "NTA. Absolutely not. Your mom sounds outrageous", "NTA \n\n1. At this point in pregnancy, it\u2019s important to not go anywhere without at least a cellphone in case of an emergency. \n\n2. Has your mother acted like this before? If she\u2019s never behaved like this before and it\u2019s brand new behavior, she might have to speak with her doctor. It\u2019s could be something bigger like behavioral issues or an illness or new medication taking a toll on her. This is not an excuse but it\u2019s a possibility \n\nIf she has behaved like this before and it\u2019s known to be recurring , but it\u2019s been a long time or it was never directed at you..beware \ud83d\udea9", "NTA. Your mom is crazy. You said everything needed", "It\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter if she knew you had your phone or not.. you\u2019re a high risk pregnancy and she left you alone in a park with no water or any way to get home because she\u2019s upset about a kids name that not born yet,nor I may add is hers.. she should be embarrassed af for behaving like a hormonal teenager.", "NTA - we told everyone asking we will call our first child Hiltrud-Chantalle because she has a german and a french parent and we wanted her to have a name if both languages. It worked. Everyone was really glad about the Name we cose after that (my mom called the child trudy until she said that wasn't her name, but that was fine for everyone). Hust say that you wanna tell her the name AFTER the baby is born.\n\nBut is everything ok with your mom? Acting like.this,.isn't normal for a decent human beeing. So maybe there is something else?\nAnd if there is maybe not driving could be a safety issue. It's totally understandable not to let someone who is mad  at so/st at the moment drive you.", "NTA. \nThat was NOT an apology. She sounds like a PITA!", "NTA\n\nI'm wondering if your mother's frustration might be due to her wanting to get a personalized gift for the baby. Regardless of what her reason might be, she was immature and completely overreacted. Even if you weren't pregnant driving off and leaving you like that is completely wrong. If she was embarrassed by you calling out her bad behavior in front of others, good because it was her bad behavior not yours and she should be embarrassed.", "NTA\n\nMom screwed up.  Glad you knew your grandfather\u2019s number", "NTA about being indecisive about a name. I always had a boy name ready but ended up having 3 girls. \n\nWe struggled a lot with the first one - couldn't think of any names we both liked until the day before she was born, when I gave him two options and he picked one of them.\n\nNaming a child is important - there are so many stories about parents regretting the name choice - your mother overreacted, was petty and irresponsible and put yours and your daughter's health at risk.\n\nJust relax about the name - it will come to you even if you have to wait until you look into her little face - good luck, and don't forgive your mother too quickly!", "NTA, I would refuse to discuss your baby\u2019s name until their name has been legally registered with the government. \n\n\nPlease set boundaries with her now so she doesn\u2019t pull more of this after your baby is born. Some previously sane grandparents loose control of themselves when their grandchildren arrive and will stomp on and all over their adult child to access their grandchild. I\u2019d make it very clear that you are the mom and you alone make the rules for your child, not your mom. Her job is to respect the rules you\u2019ve set not challenge them. If she disrespects your rules, it can show your child that they don\u2019t need to respect your rules either. I\u2019ve BTDT & found a lot more of this when I was a single mom. My parent tried to jump into a parenting role towards my child & tried to overstep my parenting which created big issues between us which still linger today, years later. \n\n\nAnd a big congratulations to you! I hope your sweet baby continues to stay put and that rest of your pregnancy is uneventful both medically and with your family.", "INFO: Did she have something expensive custom made for the upcoming baby with the original name you had picked out?", "First of all\u2026. NTA.\n\nBut i would wonder what may have caused this\u2026. Could it possibly be that your mother ordered stuff for you with the previous baby name on it as a surprise, and she now has to go back and change it all (possibly again?)\u2026 like jewelry, baby stuff, artwork, etc\u2026. it doesn\u2019t justify the reaction by any means, but just a side thought.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And everything she did after that incident is 10x worse.", "She embarrassed herself!", "If she's acting out of character and she's older, it might be the early signs of a decline such as dementia. You didn't say her age so I might be out of order suggesting it but often there a subtle signs years before more obvious ones. Loss of inhibition and patience are common ones. I realise this is left-field so sorry about that: just throwing it out there.", "NTA and just give the non-apology back when she complains about the name or the way you reacted.  Just keep repeating \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u201d over and over.  Grey rock her.", "Wow your mom is a real piece of work! NTA and your mom sounds like she isn\u2019t quite rational at all! I wouldn\u2019t get in the car with her either, she ruined your trust in her! That\u2019s the last thing you\u2019d expect your mom to do to you while pregnant and high risk! Hell I\u2019m not pregnant at all and I would lose my shit if my mom did that to me!!!!!!!!", "NTA \n\nA suggestion only to just work through your baby naming yourself and let whoever know once the baby gets here and you put the name on the birth certificate. \n\nI suggest this as happened to someone I knew they had a name all picked out and when they first saw their daughter they went with something else. \n\nBest wishes to you and your soon to be here child.", "Your own mother left you in a park, 8 months pregnant, on a hot day, without a phone, and no indication if she is coming back.  Your reaction was quite restraint.   I would have gone atomic bomb on her.  \n\nNTA.", "She feels \"you're overreacting\"?\nTell her you're \"sorry she feels that way\".\n\nNTA", "NTA\nRegarding the baby name, I changed my son's name when he was an hour old. I changed it to a name we hadn't even considered once. 28 years later, I still love his name. The right name will come.", "I have no words. NTA and main character mom needs to keep her distance for a while. I'm so sorry she lost her mind on you. Best of love and luck with the baby.", "NTA. Your mother sounds like a narcissist.", "NTA, but maybe stop discussing the name.  She'll find out when everyone else does-- in the birth announcement.", "NTA.  She was  being ridiculous and regardless of whether or not you had your phone, she shouldn't have left you there for 10 minutes.  I would cut her off.  Start going LC and depending on how she acts after the baby is born and named, go NC.", "NTA", "NTA. I called my grandparents on my mom when I was 4. It was amazing.", "Ignore all these morons weighing in on the semantics of how many months pregnant you are and how many weeks to go; totally irrelevant\u2026NTA and I wouldn\u2019t get in the car with her after that for fear her anger was still simmering and she would drive irresponsibly. Glad your grandfather came thru for you and you elected to drive with the mature adult rather than an irrational narcissist thinking she has any say in what you name your child\u2026her behavior was atrocious!", "Your mom is an unstable AH. Dont let her spend unsupervised time with your child until she learns how to behave like an adult. Sounds like the type to hardcore  punish a toddler for something they dont understand yet.", "NTA. Seriously?  Leaving you there,  at 8 1/2 months pregnant, and high risk as well. I'm so sorry!  That's just ridiculous behavior!", "Your mom sounds like a lunatic! She doesn't sounds safe for you or the  baby to be around. Good luck! NTA", "She thinks YOU are overreacting when SHE got pissed and left you at the park over the name of YOUR baby.  Perhaps she needs to look up the definition of overreaction.", "Ok but as a high risk mum, you could go at any time. The heat, stress and everything else? She\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t go into labour there. Absolutely NTA", "You are so right,  I don't like to take my phone everywhere but my daughter has insisted because of my numerous health problems.  Was without it one time and Doctor was trying to contact me because of a test result that led to an ER visit.", "Doesn't matter the reason, WRONG thing to do!!", "Everybody just wants the showering of support from internet strangers I guess", "[deleted]", "Your mama is acting like her opinion about what you name her baby is any of her business.", "LEt her find out the namer you chose after giving birth. It does not concer her, she does not get a vote.", "I cried reading this. Sending hugs to OP", "I'm 28 weeks pregnant, and people keep asking whether we've picked a name and whether we've found out the gender even though we have repeatedly told people we are not finding out the sex and will not decide on a name till the baby is here\nThere's absolutely no reason she needs to know the baby's name before it is born, does she not realize how often parents will pick a name only to change it after the baby has been born?", "Maybe she has/is planning on buying/making a gift with the babies' name inscribed on it. In which case I can understand her frustration... particularly if the gift is time or cost intensive. Either way NTA but just just for for thought.", "NTA. You can pick a name everyday but you won\u2019t really know until you're holding that baby in your arms.", "My bet is she has done other stuff \"like this\" but it got dismissed and explained away. And as we get older, we tend not to 'mask' as well. \n\nKeep a close eye on her, this won't be the last time something 'like this' happens.", "You're NTA. From reading your comments, this is an aberration from her usual behaviour. So my advice is\n\n1) Always have your phone on you.\n\n2)Take note of your mom's behaviour going forward. Did she act badly because she is under a lot of pressure (caring for high risk, pregnant child,  preparing for living with (and caring for) newborn grandchild) (as an aside have you organised guardianship in even of death?) Or is it an indicator of a health issue? If you note a pattern, then get her to a doctor. (Because you're gonna have a lot going on, can I suggest that you write it down somewhere with the date. Make a mom note and write down what happened and the date. then you won't have to try and remember and won't miss anything, and it will be easier to spotba pattern.)\n\n3)Is your mom getting enough breaks? Is there any way to get some relief support so she can get a way for a weekend. Especially if you're on bed rest for another 7 weeks (and then dealing with living with a newborn) and as much as possible her getting regular breaks.\n\n4)Do you have other people to lean on (emotionally)? This has to be a lot for her, likely a lot more than she had expected when you decided to get pregnant. Does she have someone to lean on?\n\n5)Are you talking about things that aren't baby and/or your health? Are you talking about her life? Baby is exciting, but it can't be the only topic of conversation! Health is concerning but can become a source of anxiety especially if she feels she can't get away from it.\n\n6) You may find that raising a baby with your mom just won't work like you had thought (short-term or long term) and if it does, that's fine. Your plan can change.", "So there is just multi generational bad decision making going on here\n\nNTA", "INFO you\u2019re on bed rest but are approved to walk a mile daily?", "Well, it\u2019s not, and you can give your faux apology mother the cold shoulder until she shows some true remorse.", "Try harder, bot.", "[removed]", "40 weeks is 10 Februarys, but all other months are a little more than four weeks. 40 weeks would be more like 9 months plus an extra week or so.", "Yes a full term pregnancy is 40 weeks, but it's not 10 months. It's easier to think about the fact that a year has 52 weeks. If each month had 4 weeks we'd wind up with 13 months. If you instead look at 9 out of 12 months as 3/4 of a year and then take 3/4 of 52 weeks, you get 39 weeks. So 9 months is 39 weeks, not 36. Full term is slightly over 9 months at 40 weeks, but it isn't a full ten months.", "I agree.\n\nI also think that it really sounds like there\u2019s something else going on here. Maybe she\u2019s done some huge custom gift like a hand-engraving of a ring or something.\n\nIDK that OP needs to dick around and act childishly. Just say: \u201cLook, mom, IDK yet, don\u2019t make any permanent plans, and you\u2019ll know when we know. If you\u2019ve made any plans, sorry, just don\u2019t make any more. I might say I\u2019m dead set on it one day, and change my mind the next. I might even change her name a few times before she\u2019s 2. Just relax.\u201d", "What she did (driving away) was wrong.\n\nBut we have no idea if it was over nothing.", "My mother did that with me. She\u2019d picked out Charlotte, Rebecca\u2026didn\u2019t give much thought to boy names for some reason (my sex was kept a surprise until I was born), but when she saw me, she knew I was the name I now have. Which is funny because she\u2019d not given the name that much thought before that.", "Exactly what I thought. Family heirloom, hand-engraved, and now has the wrong name or something. \n\nStill utterly 100% wrong to leave her pregnant daughter out there. But it really seems like something else going on.", "Bad bot.", "Thank you! I have been confused by the math of pregnancy forever, this is the first time it has been explained in a way that makes sense to me.", "Yes thank you for this explanation that makes sense! I've been pregnant and didn't understand it then LoL", "134340\n\nI am a name, not a number!\n\n\\- Pluto", "Still is the Planet of Hearts \ud83d\udc95", "And the first 2 weeks of your pregnancy, you're not even pregnant!!!         \nPregnancy is dated from the first day of your last menstrual cycle,  but you don't ovulate, therefore conceive, until around 2 weeks after that!"]}
