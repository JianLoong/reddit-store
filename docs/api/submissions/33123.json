Sounds like the mother had a time management issue.  That\u2019s not your fault nor is she entitled to your spot just cause she has a baby.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEACH of thease AHs badmouthing you had the option to giuve up THEIR place on the bus for her. THEY CHOSE not to do it. Just like you.", "Do you know how long the mother would have to wait for the next bus, and how long her journey was going to be?  Well, unless the bus you were getting was a direct bus without stops, or you recognised her from near where you live, it would be very unlikely you'd be able to answer that. \n\nI am unclear from your post if the mother with baby was actually trying to jump the queue, or if she was simply trying to reach the bus before it pulled away and in her haste was blinkered to others waiting to board. \n\nThe old lady did ask if she could board first, but actually it is unclear what her reasoning for asking was. Maybe she felt she couldn't stay standing much longer, maybe wanted first dibs on any seat, maybe wanted time whilst two younger people were boarding to get to a set, or maybe she had a good idea that the bus would be full to bursting and she might not be let on if she was behind someone else in the queue. Heck, maybe the old lady was really an AH for trying to con you out of a space on the bus by politely asking(?!). \n\n(Either way, you & your brother said yes. You'd done a kind deed.)\n\nThere are too many unknowns, like how long it would've been before the next bus arrived, or even how far the mother was travelling, to know how much you'd inconvenienced a mother and baby. This was a set of circumstances where there was sadly going to be someone missing out.\n\nBut it is a pity that the old lady didn't pipe up on the bus her thanks for being permitted to jump ahead of you in the queue - that might have shamed the people who had been staring and murmuring into realising that just because they hadn't shown you show respect doesn't mean you have none. They were being AH for making assumptions about you.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have pushed, but where I\u2019m from, typically you let the elderly, pregnant, disabled and people with babies board the bus first out of courtesy.", "NTA - you don't have to sacrifice your space on the bus for her just because she has a child. You did a wonderful gesture for the older lady and that's that.", "No if I'm understanding it correctly, there were no seats left on the bus. Which means the woman would have to stand holding a baby....\n\nNTA", "NTA - A line is a line . \u2026 it\u2019s a bit more unstructured here than other places", "ESA. She is for trying to jump line without asking and you are for pushing past someone holding a baby and only thinking about yourself. Sometimes there is no cut and dried, right or wrong, response.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't responsible to radically adjust your schedule for a late-comer and therefore you are not the A in this situation. If any of the other snarky riders intended anything more than to degrade others, they would have quickly given up their positions to accommodate the woman they felt was so much more deserving.", "NTA\u2026 who cares wht ppl think they would do the same as u", "YTA. If everyone had a shitty attitude like you society would be doomed", "Yes, soft YTA but so is EVERYONE ELSE who didn't let that mom on. Anyone who says something to you, you can respond with asking them why they didn't give up their seat for her. Having been a pregnant person and a person with 1 and even 2 children under 2yo traveling on public transportation as the sole adult caregiver, I would say 95% of people are assholes. :-) I survived though and the RARE person who would allow me/us to sit was an angel from heaven.", "YTA. This is a highly selfish act, and I get that you were trying to look out for yourself, but because of you\u2019s a mother and her baby would have to find another way home, or wait multiple hours for another bus.", "NTA. The old lady can\u2019t help getting old. All of our bodies will start to shutdown and weaken at some point. But mom with a kid? Having a kid is a privilege you DO NOT NEED to live your life. She chose to have a kid, not the world\u2019s problem to accommodate her. \n\nAnd I\u2019m saying this as a kid who was constantly dragged through the underbelly of NYC public transit growing up. Little brother in a stroller me jogging next to it as my mom navigated around all the chaos. We survived. It taught us how to navigate a crowd. Taught us the importance of being on time for specific trains and buses. Taught us how not to be in the way of others and acknowledge we aren\u2019t the only people in the world.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm getting on, especially if I've already let an elderly lady jump the queue. I deserve to get home just as much as everyone else. \nNote that nobody who moaned told the driver to stop and offered to get off... People are quick to judge others for not doing something but then do nothing to offer help.", "No, the lady would have got priority seating as she was holding a baby. YTA", "He already let an old lady board before him. How was he thinking \u201conly of himself\u201d?", "The lady would have been required to stand and hold the baby. I don't think that's very safe.", "She should have asked if she could be let in first, lol, some people think they are priority just because they are with a child. It's your choice to have a child so why is it \"selfish\" when somebody doesn't let you in first or give you special treatment? It'a your choice to have a child", "Yep, and among the 95% who are AHs are the entitled people who are pregnant or have small children with them. \n\nWhy does another person's desire to procreate have to impact another, totally unrelated person's daily life?\n\nEspecially since the desire to have a child is a choice. \n\nPregnant people and people with children have a sense of entitlement that is astounding.", "And because OP is childless, that means they deserve less?

As someone who experiences god awful traffic to and from work on a daily basis, I am definitely looking out for myself above all", "He already let an elderly person board first. Just cause she popped out a kid doesn\u2019t make her time anymore valuable than his. Is he just supposed to keep letting women, children and the elderly keep going ahead of him so he can never board?

Not because they deserve it, but because it\u2019s the right thing to do", "It used to be called common courtesy. Manners. They are seriously lacking in our society.", "No, I\u2019m not saying OP should\u2019ve let every person on board before themselves. But this mother and her child were rushing towards the bus, and OP chose to quickly rush on, leaving this lady and her baby stranded. I\u2019m not saying her having a baby gives her right to have automatic access to a bus before anyone else, but it also doesn\u2019t mean that they should be considered the same as everyone else either. If it\u2019s a dog eat dog world, OP ate the dog.", "Why is it \"the right thing to do?\" Why are their wants and needs elevated over other people? Why isn't it considered selfish on the woman with a child's part if she took spots away from other people?\n\neta: To be clear, I'm not arguing against reserved seats for elderly/disabled/pregnant women. This is an entirely different situation.", "Why is it the right thing to do to let the woman with the baby on the bus? It just is, common courtesy if you will. And look, is it selfish of the woman to try and takes spots away from others. Absolutely. But the right thing to do would have been to give up the spot on the bus. Looking out for others over oneself is more important in my opinion. I know most people won\u2019t agree, but I\u2019d like to believe there are people who would accept what this woman was trying to do, and just let it happen. I know you probably won\u2019t agree, and that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019ll always believe it\u2019s the right thing to do.", "\u201cIt just is.\u201d Your opinion doesn\u2019t make something a fact. You\u2019ve been asked why a woman with a child deserves to be prioritised in any given situation, and your continued response is simply that it\u2019s the right thing to do. \n\nAllowing the woman with a child to board first, which would have seriously inconvenienced the OP, would have been a KIND thing to do. There is no moral obligation, or \u201cright\u201d thing to do, in this situation. Not performing a second act of kindness \u2014 after having allowed the elderly passenger to board first \u2014 does not make the OP an asshole.\n\nNTA."]}
