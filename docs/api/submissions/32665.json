We spoil them with luxuries that we wouldn\u2019t have been at liberty to afford ourselves growing up. However, between horseback riding lessons and lacrosse practice, I feel like both my energy and my bank account are being sucked dry. Sometimes, they express gratitude. Other times, I feel as though I am being used and taken for granted.\n\nEarlier this week, I was playing croquet with the little ones when it dawned on me that it was almost Christmas. Upon this realization, I asked them what they wanted for Christmas, to which my daughter rolled her eyes and replied \u201cDon\u2019t care, just renew my Spotify Premium.\u201d I was shocked. I looked over at my son, who giggled \u201cYou heard her.\u201d\n\nI remember growing up, my mother telling me that every parent has a moment where they look into their children\u2019s eyes and think \u201cI resent the monster I created.\u201d This was my moment.\n\nIn my fit of rage, I told my children that if I renewed their Spotify Premium, that would be their only Christmas gift this year. My daughter said, and I quote, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d Little did she know, I would.\n\nThat night, when I was in bed with my hubby, we had a long and heated discussion about Christmas. While he thought I was being unreasonable at first, we eventually came to an agreement. We agreed that our children already get everything they want so we should just treat Christmas like any other day this year. No waking up early and sitting around the Christmas tree. No opening gifts. The only thing we\u2019ll be opening is my phone to renew their Spotify Premium.\n\nHowever, last night when I had my weekly drinks with the girls from work, they were floored. They said I was being unruly, reactionary, and some even questioned my parenting skills. Now, I\u2019m questioning my decision and considering making some last minute trips to the mall. Am I being an asshole or should I stick to my decision?", "created_utc": 1702119631, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18eb8ku/aita_for_only_getting_my_children_spotify_premium/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You cant even get out of summer without them asking about it.  \n\nYou just made this up to sound miserly.  Your creative writing needs to be improved.", "I think YTA for \u201ccancelling Christmas\u201d instead of working to make it what it should be. Stick to your guns about no presents aside from their subscription, but still make it a gift. Make a nice card with a homemade \u201cvoucher\u201d for their subscription, write a note that highlights what you like about them and are proud of them for. Do the other kinds of celebration, like a Christmas tree and a nice meal. Sure, they are not going to be thrilled on the day, and when they kick off, tell them \u201cI don\u2019t like how our family has become so materialistic and ungrateful for the things we have. Christmas should be about us spending time together, and we all receive more \u201cstuff\u201d than we need the rest of the year. They will probably tantrum but stick to your guns about making it a warm (but gift free) celebration of family. \u201cCanceling\u201d Christmas rather than starting the hard work of reframing it will just make you a grinch and is about \u201cpunishing\u201d rather than changing", "You\u2019re kind of TA for raising brats. As far as Christmas goes, I don\u2019t think the way to correct their brattiness is to be a brat right back to them. If you want to cancel Christmas, go ahead, but do you have a bigger plan to correct their attitudes in general? \n\nAnd who forgets Christmas is around the corner? That\u2019s not even computing for me. Lights in houses, decorations everywhere, ads on everything\u2026 make it make sense.", "YTA. Yes your children are spoiled, but is cancelling Christmas festivities the best way to go about it? Personally, I think it\u2019s a step too far. \n\nYou could renew Spotify and get some small stocking filler gifts for each child? Nothing extravagant.", "YTA for raising spoiled children, which in the end makes their life harder. Here in Danmark we have an expression: \"At g\u00f8re dit barn en bj\u00f8rnetjeneste\", which roughly translates to: Intending to do your child a favor, but actually it's not in their best interest at all.\n\nIn your case you gave your children luxuries you didn't have yourself growing up, but it has made them spoiled and disrespectful towards you. But I don't see why they should be punished, because they did not ask to be spoiled, you did that to them. They might not realize that what they have is a privileged life, because it's just normal for them.\n\nMaybe from now on you can spoil them less? Such as from the new year they have to choose 1 of the sports they do, and maybe help around the house more, or do volunteer work.\n\nAnd also, model the behavior you want to see. Do you express gratitude or appreciation when someone does something for you? If you model this behavior, it might become more normal for them to recognize and express gratitude.", "I think this is a troll post. I don\u2019t think this is a real situation, nor are these real people. On the off chance that this made up story happened and you had a conversation about Spotify premium whilst \u2018playing croquet with the little ones\u2019, then sure, YTA.", "I\u2019m confused because you asked her what she wanted and she said to just renew Spotify Premium. She\u2019s only asking for 1 thing so beside her smart attitude what is the issue?", "You do realise your children would not be who they were without your guidance? YTA\n\nIf your children were truly awful, it\u2019s because you the parents have failed to adequately parent them. To punish your children for your own failures is wrong, not to mention, ironically pathetic. Take some responsibility for poorly raising your children if you think they\u2019ve behaved badly, but no where have I seen your children actually behave badly. They asked for no outrageous gifts, they have not expressed any insane demands, merely a cheeky response to the lifestyle you\u2019ve raised them to expect. \n\nHorseback riding is a luxury you\u2019ve raised your children to know and expect. That\u2019s on you. If your budget cannot handle it, that\u2019s a you problem. You should\u2019ve thought of this before introducing it to your children. \n\nDo better as parent. Teach your children better. Don\u2019t punish them for something you\u2019ve taught them to known. Take responsibility of your own actions. YTA for punishing your children for something that was your responsibility.\n\nAnecdotally, I was raised in boarding schools ridding horses, playing sports like polo, and skiing in the Alps. It was not a luxury, merely a fact of my childhood. It was not something I asked for, it was what happened to me. I did not choose it, I did not demand it, I did not know to want it. I did not even know of it until it was part of my life and if my parents had punished me for having something they chose to be a part of my life I\u2019d not only be incredibly angry but confused. I did not control my life. I was a child. These things happened to me, by my parents\u2019 choice.", "Wtf this story is a wild ride from beginning to end. \n\nLots of lots of doing wrong over years and in addition total misinterpretation on why to celebrate christmas. \n\nAll of you are Assholes.", "YTA\n\nI'm going to go one step further and say I don't even fully understand what you're worked up about. Your kids don't express gratitude for the things you spend money on? Are they things they requested or are they things you decided they should do? They didn't ask for anything for Christmas? I'm willing to believe they said it in a snotty way, but they're pre-teens. Get used to things being said in a snotty way. And if not requesting anything for Christmas is rude, I'm a monster; I struggle yearly to come up with gift ideas. I understood being annoyed but I'm baffled by the amount of resentment you have towards your kids.", "YTA for writing this fake shit", "YTA \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for your feelings, but I\u2019d just set a budget and ask them what they want, get them to set up an amazon wish list, and then pick and chose from that.  Otherwise they\u2019ll get the cash equivalent.", "YTA for creating this situation. At 13, your daughter has had a good life, never wanting for anything. She is now a spoiled teen who doesn't appreciate what she has. This is a great learning opportunity for your entire family to shake things up and do something different this year. Figure out the average amount of money you spend on each other every Christmas, including you and your husband. Set a small dollar amount for presents for all of you, $50 each, maybe. With the rest, become a secret Santa for those who could use a bit of holiday magic. The USPS, other national organizations, or a local church or store might have a wish tree. As a family, make some strangers holiday special. Don't make this a punishment for your kids. Become an example. \n\nThroughout the year, get them involved in the community by becoming a volunteer. Make them do extra chores to earn money for things they want. Are there opportunities at the stables? With the lacrosse team? My daughter volunteered at the community center working with kids at 14, hired at 16. My son will soon start after he turns 12 because he wants to.", "YTA. Way to go OP, do that and your children are gonna hate both you and your husband.", "YTA!\n\nWhy punish your children because you're bad parents and don't teaches your children how privileged they are? E.g. being grateful. \n\nGive them a nice Christmas and work on your parenting skills the rest of the year instead. Going nuclear on Christmas will only create resentment in a bad way.", "ESH. Them obviously for being ungrateful and you for wanting to treat Christmas like any day just because of the screwdriver. Leaving aside the gifts, at least make plans for Christmas Day to be special it\u2019s not all about gifts. It\u2019s about experiences and memories you could even do something like decorating Christmas cookies or watching Christmas movies together.", "ESH; your children are being stupid jerks, which often happens at their age. You, as the parent, are obligated to do and be better (and yes, that means all the time).\n\nNow, you're not the AH for only doing Spotify as their gift; I don't use it, but googling the price it looks like that's like about $130 for the year? That's a pretty good gift (at least, by the math I grew up with, which is admittedly 10-15 years out of date). The AH part is taking away all the other Christmas stuff. That's petty, and as a parent you don't get to be petty with your children. Set a better example.", "Really?  How popular is croquet still?  I mean I played it at my grandparents house but that was years ago. Then I get realizing Christmas is in in w weekish, but you know it\u2019s coming, every add on the radio, tv snd billboard lets you know.", "YTA for \"cancelling Christmas\".You're just reinforcing the lesson that it's all about gifts which it seems you've already taught them. Stick to your guns only renew their Spotify premium and enjoy the family centric elements of Christmas.", "YTA She's being a spoiled brat. She's also 13. What's your excuse for acting the same way?", "YTA. You only get a handful of Christmases while your children are young. To squander one with this pettiness is asshole behavior. Not for nothing, but what you\u2019re describing is just.. being a parent. You give your kids what you didn\u2019t have. You pay for their extracurriculars because you want them to have a full life. If you an expect an 11 year old to understand the sacrifice that takes then you\u2019re insane to boot.", "YTA. You got mad because your 13 year old rolled her eyes and asked for a Spotify subscription renewal? I\u2019m so confused. \n\nYour kids shouldn\u2019t need to thank you every time you do something or buy something for them. Kids don\u2019t know any different than what you show them.", "I'm confused as to why your daughter only wanting Spotify premium is such an issue. It's an acknowledgement she already has everything she wants. You are complaining that Christmas, which is one of the most special days for a family, would not be about expensive gifts, but complaining also about the money you spend on your kids.", "YTA\n\nMaybe take your kids to volunteer? Have them donate toys they don't use but are in good condition. There are ways you can teach your children to be grateful and realize how good they have it. \n\nYou are instead choosing to punish them? For what? Acting the way you raised them? \n\nBe a parent and actually teach them what you want them to know. \n\n\nWtf is this", "YTA for making a fake post. I used to be that asshole too so I\u2019ll share some tips. \n\nYou over-wrote it. Maybe that was the joke. But for believability, keep in mind people who post stuff like this for real are usually idiots. The dumber you sound the more believable you\u2019ll be, strangely enough. It\u2019s like playing dumb in an irl conversation.", "NTA.\n\nStick to your guns. I understand why hubby and you are providing your kids with so much to make up for having grown into more humble financial backgrounds (so many of us do the same) but you do not want to enable young people to grow in selfish, ungrateful, spoiled adults who take things for granted and who are used to think the world revolves around them.\n\nYou are actually trying to be a good parent.   \nHowever, if you will get my advice, try to communicate your plan without emotional nuances. They will very likely melt down so avoid entering into passive-aggressive mode and plainly say you bought what you were asked for. Christmas morning won\u2019t be the moment for soul-searching. They will be shocked enough and not likely to listen to you and hear your reasoning. Keep it to a minimum so that you have a chance to talk when reality will have sinked in and they will be more keen to hear your rationale at later moment.\n\nGood luck, many of us have been there \ud83d\ude0a", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you actually love your kids?", "NTA, you're giving them what they asked for. Though like other ppl have said it might have been better to not raise them expecting whatever they want at any time of the year.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your children get plenty of things throughout the year and subscription services aren\u2019t exactly cheap anymore either. Your friends are free to get whatever they want for their own demons, but so are you and your husband. I don\u2019t feel like this is something anyone should be judged for anyway.", "NAH - They didn't do anything particularly bad for children their age, but the words that they used reek of entitlement. Perhaps you should establish chores so in the future when they become teens they're more sound-minded and don't become permanently like this.", "NTA for the gift but very much TA for cancelling all other Christmas activities.", "NTA better late than never.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
