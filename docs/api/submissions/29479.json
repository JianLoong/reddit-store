The girlfriend has way too much entitlement. It\u2019s not a shopping spree, it\u2019s trying to divvy up parts of someone\u2019s life when that someone mattered to you so you can keep loving the objects she spent her life collecting\n\nI\u2019m so, so sorry for your loss", "NTA.  This is why the rules for distribution of an estate need to be laid out ahead of time.  \n\nWhat i have seen done is that the estate's items had monetary values attached to them; the estate would then be shared equally -- in terms of value -- among the heirs; and the heirs would go around, in turn, choosing what they wanted.  In such a distribution scheme, whatever your cousin's girlfriend asked for would have their value gets deducted from his share.", "NTA. I'd take whatever she took away from her. Sounds like she was grabbing shit to sell", "NTA. Who does she think she is? I can understand if the FAMILY of the grandmother wanted to take certain things but the girlfriend of a cousin? Hell no. Especially if she wants to take expensive things, why would she complain about not getting anything when it wasn't even her relative..weirdddddd!", "It wasn't a shopping trip. She shouldn't have been allowed to select anything, maybe after all the family who made their selections. She shouldn't have been allowed to leave with anything. If she has, I bet it's gone. NTA.", "What the actual fuck?? No, NTA at allll. Their behavior, and especially hers, was WAY over the line IMO.", "Nta. Sounds like she\u2019s just grabbing things with the intention of selling them, and that is so incredibly tacky I can\u2019t even imagine.", "NTA That is straight up stealing, taking expensive items from an estate she has no claim on.", "NTA OP.  If she refuses to return the items she took, you can always file a police report, because what she did was theft.", "Definitely NTA. And get the pearls and coins back. Gf can beat it! Not only is she not family, she never met your grandma!", "Your cousin GF is vulture, she just wants to sell those vintage items for money or keep for herself. she didn't take all those thing bc she has sentiments, and how could she have sentiment for person she never met.\n\nNTA", "NTA,\n\nbut honestly what in the actual fk is wrong with peoples entitlement these days? if anything said girlfriend or anyone not directly related or married should not have any pick until its items left behind to sell or give away....\n\nlike.....what a world...", "NTA.", "NTA.  Claim everything back.  That female has no right to anything.  Be aggressive about getting it.", "NTA and yes - get those items back. What a damn nerve she has even touching anything in that house - it was not her grandparent.   Some people are so entitled.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell her to return the items or you will file a police report.", "NTA. The girlfriend has zero right to take anything at all.", "Thank you. Her boyfriend, my cousin, feels that she can have it because of him. He also was so overdramaticly faking his sadness at my grandmother's funeral that the 3 children of her were furious. He isn't liked in the family, because of this constant fakeness. They ended up with half of the stuff in her house regardless, despite everyone protesting. I'm not sure why his girlfriend thinks it's okay to take her things. It's all expensive things, too. She didn't want anything else.", "I don't know why this was not done, the family is always in turmoil about this stuff... but it was the 4 children's decision. I'm just a grandchild.", "I think the only way to get it back is for my dad and my other aunt to raise a stink about it. I know the cousin's mother, my aunt, will defend her for God knows why. I guess because mommy has to protect her son", "I want to. But I feel I need the back up of my aunt and dad. Because I'm sure my other aunt (cousins mom) will use the excuse that she gave it to her. Which, sure, but if you claimed them with intentions of giving away, shouldn't family get first dibs? It's a dumb and petty situation. My grandmother I'm sure would hate this whole thing.", "Check Facebook market place and I\u2019m 90% sure you\u2019ll find her selling that stuff. They sound like trash people imo", "Phew this happened in my family when my Nannie died; somehow lots of jewelry that was supposed to go to specific people walked away and \u201cno one knows where it is\u201d. It was up to the 4 children to decide how things were divvied up, too, but *some people* had unrestricted access to her things before anyone else could get in there to see and choose. And some of us were just flat out \u201cforgotten\u201d. I\u2019m still bitter, in case you can\u2019t tell, and it\u2019ll be three years this December.", "The best way to get it back is to involve the police, or at least threaten to if the items aren't returned.", "That girl has zero right to take anything at all , and the fact that she not only did take things without asking , but took only valuable things proves she's a no class loser. For example, I'm not the best person in the world ( I refuse to vote, I watch illegal streaming services daily, I'm late to pretty much everything and I curse like a drunken sailor, to name a few) but were I in the shoes of the gf I would have felt awkward being there in the first place , and knowing what loss is, would respectfully have kept quiet and out of the way, maybe offering to help move or load things.  I damn sure wouldn't have treated it like a free for all when I'm not even family, and even if I was family, vi wouldn't act like a greedy little shit.  Which is exactly what that girl is, your cousin also shows a serious lack of respect for his grandmother's memory .   If there's one thing I cannot stand is when family fights over a passed relatives estate.
