I bought a ~$900k condo in downtown Miami about 3 months into relationship and he keeps complaining that it isn\u2019t a single family home in the suburbs with a yard for his dog and then kept saying my purchase was \u201cdumb\u201d because I could have bought a house he liked better for 350k. He didn\u2019t contribute to the purchase price or anything and we had only been together for a couple months at that point, so I went with my preferred location. I\u2019m in real estate and got a great deal on it, so I\u2019ve told him it\u2019s demeaning and yet he\u2019s repeated it. \n\nHe became very pushy about moving in and I let him. I hate it. He only pays $1,000 in rent when normally my unit would rent for 5k so obviously 1k is not 50% of market rent at all. \nI wouldn\u2019t have an issue with that normally, but he is constantly complaining about it. He pushes me to buy new household items (I furnished the whole house without him). He has called the place a shithole, which it\u2019s not, and then tried to deflect by saying he meant the city is a shithole.\n\nDuring an argument yesterday he purposely banged my brand new fridge into the adjoining door, denting the front of the fridge. When I was upset about it and asked him to replace the door he got mad and said he\u2019d already said sorry and to \u201cquit.\u201d When I brought it up later he denied denting it. \n\nHe started yelling at me in the car today because I \u201cwasn\u2019t paying him enough attention\u201d and was peacefully looking out the window, not bothering anybody just in a quiet mood for a minute. He was mad and turned the radio up so loud it hurt my ears. \n\nI want him removed, he doesn\u2019t have a lease and it\u2019s been <30days, so I can legally have him removed as a trespasser instead of having to go through the eviction process. \n\nWIBTA? I do not feel safe. I told him I don\u2019t feel safe and he said I was a shitty girlfriend and that\u2019s why he gets mad at me.\n\nUPDATE: He left today for a work trip for a week, that\u2019s why I\u2019m rushing to figure this out. I said I had a trip planned so his friend is watching the dog. \nI broke up with him over text but he\u2019s demanding to be allowed in when he gets back to get his personal items. I said if you have a licensed moving company come it shouldn\u2019t take them more than an hour, but he is not to come with. Otherwise the police informed me over the phone I\u2019m under zero obligation to give him any of it. He hasn\u2019t accepted the moving company idea yet and called me a \u201cpsycho\u201d when I said I didn\u2019t feel safe having him physically present to move anything.\n\nI\u2019m afraid to get a restraining order, that that would be \u201cpoking the bear.\u201d I feel like if he\u2019s a severe danger to me he wouldn\u2019t care about an order anyway? \n\nOther concerns: \nI just had the locks changed, but my address is on his drivers license. Is he able to get a locksmith to just let him in? I keep the deadbolt down when I\u2019m home. I was going to put a sticker on the inside of the front door facing out, like \u201clocksmith call this number before opening.\u201d\nI am scared and disappointed that I didn\u2019t take the smaller things more seriously until they became bigger things.

It's online \"I got Flowers Today\" A Poem To All Woman!", "NTA change the locks and throw all his stuff out.", "Please so whatever it takes (legally) to get this guy out of your house and out of your life. NTA", "NTA and clearly he needs to go, but you need to contact an attorney or apply for a no-contact order and make sure all the i's are dotted and t's are crossed, as this guy seems like he could easily be the type to escalate things.", "I'm sorry this is happening to you but I'm hopeful that you'll be rid of him soon and thank goodness you didn't marry him. \n\nYou're right to be concerned about your own safety. \n\nYou are NTA, and like others have said, if he lives there, you can't just tell him he doesn't and that's the end of the story. As you probably realize. \n\nIf it's his legal residence, regardless of the lease, I suggest you try to get where you want incrementally: have you tried breaking up with him yet? If not, I understand. But consider starting with just that: maybe he'll be like \"if you don't worship this dick and feel lucky to have me, I'm out!\" If so that's great. Is there a chance that would happen?\n\n(Edit: you do this in public when you both drove there separately).\n\nIf not, then after breaking up with him, and making it unequivocal that it's over and he has to leave, you'll need to be ready to execute next steps. That could get ugly. \n\nYou don't want to spend additional nights in the house with him and you don't want to cede it to him, obviously, not even for a night. \n\nWho can he go stay with that you can be sure of in advance? His mom? Other family? Good friends? Be ready to facilitate this and insist on it. Ideally he doesn't go back to your house after this but if he insists that~~'s~~ may be his right, if the place is his legal residence and he doesn't threaten you: if he's like \"wow that's so sad, damn, are you sure? Damn ok, well I need to get some of my stuff for tonight. See you at the place\" then great. \n\nHowever, if not especially, at that point you need someone else you trust to be ready to meet you both at your house. \n\nAt the very least, that person is there to witness that you've broken up with him and informed him he needs to find somewhere else to live. When you arrive there, serve him with a 3 day notice, check the rules on this, I don't know exactly how it works to evict someone who's not on a lease: there's no terms that he violated that are in writing, so I'm not sure. I am ~~100%~~ fairly sure you can do it I'm just not sure of the specifics. \n\nAnyway the point is, he's been notified and there's a witness. He can quietly get his shit and leave like a man or make a scene, at which point, you or your witness call the police. \n\nFrom there it would go quickly. If he's menacing you in your home after a breakup and you telling him he needs to go elsewhere -- and noting that *he has a place to go*-- they will tell him to go to his mom's or go to jail. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, do it in a way that gives him multiple opportunities to not make it ugly, and protect yourself by having witnesses. \n\nIf you formally evict him while he's still living in your house every day *with you*, you can't leave for fear of him trashing the place and you can't stay for fear of him physically or emotionally harming you. \n\nMy suggestion is to move quickly and be sure of each next step. Be a broken record. Keep saying the same thing and not bending. Engage his mom or best friend or whatever as needed so that he's accountable to others in terms of how he handles this and so he can't say he has nowhere to go. \n\nSorry I forgot this isn't r/relationshipadvice\n\nEdit: I'm not 100% sure legal eviction is how this would go, I'm 100% she can get this bum out of her house though.

A hobo-sexual.\nHe hated everything about me but he wouldn\u2019t get out because he had nowhere to go. When I finally made him get out he spent all his money on drugs the first night, then he checked himself into a mental hospital so he wouldn\u2019t have to sleep next to a dumpster. That was five years ago and as far as I know he\u2019s still homeless. I mean I\u2019m sure he\u2019s conned other women into letting him stay with them during those five years but he doesn\u2019t do anything with the generosity he\u2019s given he just takes and takes and blames and blames.

That's why it's coming across as victim blaming.", "NTA.  He is abusing you and it will soon progress to physical abuse.  You need to get him out of your home and your life yesterday.

How DARE you treat yourself this way.  DTMFA, and get into therapy.  There is no reason you should accept this behavior.  Ever.

You need a support system. Feel free to DM me if you need support navigating this process.
