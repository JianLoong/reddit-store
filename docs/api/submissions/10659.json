He didn\u2019t contribute to the purchase price or anything and we had only been together for a couple months at that point, so I went with my preferred location. I\u2019m in real estate and got a great deal on it, so I\u2019ve told him it\u2019s demeaning and yet he\u2019s repeated it. \n\nHe became very pushy about moving in and I let him. I hate it. He only pays $1,000 in rent when normally my unit would rent for 5k so obviously 1k is not 50% of market rent at all. \nI wouldn\u2019t have an issue with that normally, but he is constantly complaining about it. He pushes me to buy new household items (I furnished the whole house without him). He has called the place a shithole, which it\u2019s not, and then tried to deflect by saying he meant the city is a shithole.\n\nDuring an argument yesterday he purposely banged my brand new fridge into the adjoining door, denting the front of the fridge.

It is your property, you bought it to suit your needs, he can move out. Purposefully damaging your items and making you scared in your own home is not a healthy relationship. You\u2019ve asked him to leave, now it\u2019s time to let him know how serious you are about him leaving.", "NTA!  Dump his ass and then get him evicted.  It will definitely be weird if you remove and still want to be with him though.", "YWBTA by illegally evicting him (YTA)  \n\n\nIf you *really\\** feel unsafe go get an order of protection against him and then the eviction won't matter because he won't be allowed there. If you are just venting then *break up with him* and *ask him to leave*. If he doesn't want to leave you can evict him in 15 days.  \n\n\n\\*Really as opposed to exaggerating for effect on a reddit post, not as in *how* unsafe you feel", "NTA.  Cut him loose, because it doesn't sound like he's contributing.  Not just to the household finances, but to the RELATIONSHIP, and that's the simplest, most basic, thing a partner should do.", "NTA. Do what you need to. Pull this poem up if you start to second guess yourself. It's online \"I got Flowers Today\" A Poem To All Woman!", "NTA change the locks and throw all his stuff out.", "Please so whatever it takes (legally) to get this guy out of your house and out of your life. NTA", "NTA and clearly he needs to go, but you need to contact an attorney or apply for a no-contact order and make sure all the i's are dotted and t's are crossed, as this guy seems like he could easily be the type to escalate things.", "I'm sorry this is happening to you but I'm hopeful that you'll be rid of him soon and thank goodness you didn't marry him. \n\nYou're right to be concerned about your own safety. \n\nYou are NTA, and like others have said, if he lives there, you can't just tell him he doesn't and that's the end of the story. As you probably realize. \n\nIf it's his legal residence, regardless of the lease, I suggest you try to get where you want incrementally: have you tried breaking up with him yet? If not, I understand. But consider starting with just that: maybe he'll be like \"if you don't worship this dick and feel lucky to have me, I'm out!\" If so that's great. Is there a chance that would happen?\n\n(Edit: you do this in public when you both drove there separately).\n\nIf not, then after breaking up with him, and making it unequivocal that it's over and he has to leave, you'll need to be ready to execute next steps. That could get ugly. \n\nYou don't want to spend additional nights in the house with him and you don't want to cede it to him, obviously, not even for a night. \n\nWho can he go stay with that you can be sure of in advance? His mom? Other family? Good friends? Be ready to facilitate this and insist on it. Ideally he doesn't go back to your house after this but if he insists that~~'s~~ may be his right, if the place is his legal residence and he doesn't threaten you: if he's like \"wow that's so sad, damn, are you sure? Damn ok, well I need to get some of my stuff for tonight. See you at the place\" then great. \n\nHowever, if not especially, at that point you need someone else you trust to be ready to meet you both at your house. \n\nAt the very least, that person is there to witness that you've broken up with him and informed him he needs to find somewhere else to live. When you arrive there, serve him with a 3 day notice, check the rules on this, I don't know exactly how it works to evict someone who's not on a lease: there's no terms that he violated that are in writing, so I'm not sure. I am ~~100%~~ fairly sure you can do it I'm just not sure of the specifics. \n\nAnyway the point is, he's been notified and there's a witness. He can quietly get his shit and leave like a man or make a scene, at which point, you or your witness call the police. \n\nFrom there it would go quickly. If he's menacing you in your home after a breakup and you telling him he needs to go elsewhere -- and noting that *he has a place to go*-- they will tell him to go to his mom's or go to jail. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, do it in a way that gives him multiple opportunities to not make it ugly, and protect yourself by having witnesses. \n\nIf you formally evict him while he's still living in your house every day *with you*, you can't leave for fear of him trashing the place and you can't stay for fear of him physically or emotionally harming you. \n\nMy suggestion is to move quickly and be sure of each next step. Be a broken record. Keep saying the same thing and not bending. Engage his mom or best friend or whatever as needed so that he's accountable to others in terms of how he handles this and so he can't say he has nowhere to go. \n\nSorry I forgot this isn't r/relationshipadvice\n\nEdit: I'm not 100% sure legal eviction is how this would go, I'm 100% she can get this bum out of her house though.

Also, while he is being a shitty bf, you are not just the gf here, you are his landlord. A landlord evicting someone with no notice because they yelled and dented a fridge makes that landlord an A. Unless, of course, he's been physically abusive to you, in which case this isn't a trespassing situation, it's a restraining order situation.\n\nHe is an obvious asshole for being an obnoxious prick.\n\nI don't know the laws in FL, but in most places just because someone is not on the lease does not mean you can evict them without notice. If you gave him keys and allowed him to live there, there is a good chance he has a legal right to be there and is not \"trespassing\" so you'd do well to review the law here before trying that.\n\nIf you are that wealthy, make it easy on both of you. Give him the legally required notice. If he won't leave before hand, then go stay somewhere else temporarily. If he overstays his notice, then you're gonna have to take the legal route.", "NTA.

What exactly does \"<30 days\" refer to?  It sounds like you both moved in together 9 months ago.\n\nIf he moved in under 30 days ago, then you can have him removed.
