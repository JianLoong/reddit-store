Currently, we're not speaking due to an awkward incident during our yearly Friendsgiving. \n\nWe've been very close for six years, hanging out about 3 days a week, and we're usually super open about our sex lives. When I crash at her place (she lives about 30 miles away), I usually sleep in the guest room.\n\nDuring the recent Friendsgiving, our plan was a quiet night in with close friends. However, things took an turn when my friend started flirting with someone I didn\u2019t know. We ended up at a bar, and it became apparent they intended to have sex.\n\nHere's the tough part - she asks if it's cool to have sex with this guy in her house while I'm in the next room. Awkward, right? Especially when he's standing there, listening to the whole negotiation. She also already knows this is something that would make me very uncomfortable. With no easy way to say no, I agreed because, hey, I don't want to drop a fortune on a 60-mile round trip Uber ride.\n\nFast forward to her place, and I'm basically tossed to the side. They head to her room, and it wasn\u2019t long before I heard them having almost exaggeratedly loud sex.  Morning comes, and he\u2019s still there. I spill my feelings about the whole thing, expecting some understanding, but she brushes it off, claiming I shouldn't be upset because she wouldn\u2019t be if the roles were reversed.\n\nI tell her it's not about who or where but doing the deed in the room next to me with a stranger was a bit much. Now she's giving me the cold shoulder, and I'm wondering if I'm the bad guy here.
