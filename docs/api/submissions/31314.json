Currently, we're not speaking due to an awkward incident during our yearly Friendsgiving. \n\nWe've been very close for six years, hanging out about 3 days a week, and we're usually super open about our sex lives. When I crash at her place (she lives about 30 miles away), I usually sleep in the guest room.\n\nDuring the recent Friendsgiving, our plan was a quiet night in with close friends. However, things took an turn when my friend started flirting with someone I didn\u2019t know. We ended up at a bar, and it became apparent they intended to have sex.\n\nHere's the tough part - she asks if it's cool to have sex with this guy in her house while I'm in the next room. Awkward, right? Especially when he's standing there, listening to the whole negotiation. She also already knows this is something that would make me very uncomfortable. With no easy way to say no, I agreed because, hey, I don't want to drop a fortune on a 60-mile round trip Uber ride.\n\nFast forward to her place, and I'm basically tossed to the side. They head to her room, and it wasn\u2019t long before I heard them having almost exaggeratedly loud sex.  Morning comes, and he\u2019s still there. I spill my feelings about the whole thing, expecting some understanding, but she brushes it off, claiming I shouldn't be upset because she wouldn\u2019t be if the roles were reversed.\n\nI tell her it's not about who or where but doing the deed in the room next to me with a stranger was a bit much. Now she's giving me the cold shoulder, and I'm wondering if I'm the bad guy here.

Me and my friends are all old now, but back in the day we used to hook up in adjacent rooms and even the same rooms sometimes and it was always good for a laugh. Just something that should be dealt with respectfully and with understanding everyone\u2019s comfort levels first I guess.", "This post has clearly been brigaded by some weird puritan fringe group. Literally every YTA has two dozen downvotes and with no reason given.\n\nTo join the pile, yes, YTA OP. If you were in town for a couple nights after traveling long distance and didn't see each other often, it would make the situation ever so slightly different, and even then, you'd still be the asshole.\n\nFirst off. Sex is not a big deal. Hearing people having sex is not a big deal. Having a one night stand is not a big deal. It's her home, her life, and she has absolutely every right to sleep with who she wants, when she wants.\n\nNow, your friend had the courtesy to even ask you if you'd mind. Not that she had to. But she did. And what did you say? You said you didn't mind. Any standing you could have possibly had (which wasn't much) went out the window right then.\n\nI have friends that I spend a lot of time with. If I wasn't allowed to bring a partner home if one of them were crashing on my couch that night, I'd not let people over nearly so willingly.\n\nStop being so selfish and so prudish. Learn to communicate better.", "Soft ESH. \n\nBro, don't cock block your best friend. \n\nInstead of being a good wingman, you're being difficult and making her feel bad. Sorry, but I don't think you're being a good friend.", "If OP is Australian then his friends behaviour would be considered normal", "You have feelings for her. If one of your male buddies was boning a chick, would you acting so dramatic? \nPut on your big boy pants, apologize for being an asshole friend and move on!", "No i think it is completely normal to feel that way", "NTA but why are you wasting your youth visiting women you aren't intimate with yourself?", "YTA for sure", "I'll make this really simple... NTA\n\nYour friend knows she was wrong and feels guilty but is deflecting. She's mad at herself and blaming you. Set firmer boundaries, then stick to them.", "ETA. Why would you say yes? Why would she ask?", "I am late to the comments but I sincerely hope you didn\u2019t apologize. What she did was gross and awkward and inconsiderate. What you did was\u2026 show up for a hang out y\u2019all had already planned. You are so, so NTA, and it makes me sad that you think that you might in any way be.", "No, dude. NTA! And it's not \"completely reasonable\" to assume you're in love with your best friend just because you have different genders. That's stupid.", "Thank you yes omg what is this thread. \n\nI\u2019m sitting here wondering why she even asked in the first place lol? Like this is such a non issue in my social circles. While staying with friends, while traveling together... this is usually never not a possibility. And I would never expect coupled friends not have sex just because I\u2019m a guest either? Has no one had roommates before? What is this bizarro world?", "I was able to apologize earlier today and we have moved on. I opened up about my boundaries and this won\u2019t be an issue again in the future!", "What a strange comment", "Are you not very familiar with the concept of friendship? Or are you just a raging incel who can't fathom why any man would value any platonic relationship with a woman?", "If this was me and my best friend (2 dudes) I'd feel incredibly uncomfortable as well. It's fucking weird to knowingly have a friend over then ignore that friend and loudly bang in the next room over.", "I would agree if they didn\u2019t see each other often, or were just ok friends.  However they are not. They see each other frequently. They talk about sex their sex lives. He\u2019s in the \u2018walk in, grab a beverage from the fridge without asking, and putting his feet up on the couch\u2019 level of friendship here, not distant cousin or old college roommate hosting mode. \n\nA friend supports another friend, period. He should be high fiving her the next day for said booty call (after the guy left) instead of making it all weird. Or left and caught up with her later. I wonder if it would be different if his friend were a dude?", "Well, he knew they were going to have sex, then he should\u2019ve been a friend and left if he didn\u2019t want to hear it.", "What? I agreed with you", "Sounds like you were fine with her getting laid, but you just didn\u2019t want to hear it. You chose to stay and listen to it, correct? How is that her problem? The decision calculus was I rather hear the sex than pay for the Uber ride.  In the future, support the friend (and your own mental health) by making yourself scarce. YTA.", "Their closeness doesn't change boundaries or disregard them. I love my best friends and I would tell them almost anything, but I know they'd be uncomfortable if I were to have sex near them and they were to hear it. You can be close and not have boundaries in certain aspects of your friendship, but still maintain boundaries in other aspects of the friendship. I would not want to hear someone have sex, period. Close friend or not, and I know other people are the same way.\n\nAlso all of you seem to have missed the part where he said he lived 30 miles away. Having already made arrangements with her, it was anywhere from inconvenient to improbable for him to find someone else to stay, especially on such short notice. And I don't know about you, but I'd hate to put a friend in that situation just because I wanna have sex with a stranger.", "I\u2019m only interested in objective opinions. If you\u2019d read the post and some of my other comments, you\u2019d see that we\u2019ve never had any issues with each others love lives outside of this one off situation. I wasn\u2019t keen on hearing her or anyone have sex.", "Fair enough i wouldn't want to hear my friend having sex either", "Just for clarity, dude edited his comments."]}
