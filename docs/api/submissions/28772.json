This poor girl has managed to grow up sweet, respectful and financially independent in spite of having a shit show of a family. There are many good reasons to talk your kid out of a relationship. This is not one of them. Stop judging this girl by her family's behaviour and start judging her on her own. What you are doing right now is disgusting bigotry.\n\nYou apparently feel that you grew up in a better family than hers, but you turned into a disrespectful asshole, so there's proof right there that your background doesn't determine who you are.", "YTA.

Her grandmother is loud and struggles with her own things.

Her siblings have a different dad. And I guess her mother didn\u2019t even know who Eva\u2019s dad was. \n\nHow does this reflect on her? Is not something she had any control on influence over \n\n\n> - She\u2019s supported herself financially from a young age\n\nSounds admirable \n\n> - Her mother struggles with mental illness and was neglectful and abusive \n\nAs above, not something she had any control over \n\n> - Her grandmother has always lived in poverty.

Sometimes kids are motivated by their situations and strive to do better for the next generation.", "Yup, YTA.  It's not easy to actually damage your relationship with your own son but this is how you do it.  Your son gets to choose who he marries, end of story.\n\nYou are entitled to comment on his partner's suitability for him under only ONE kind of circumstance - if she is making him unhappy.  You are completely deluded if you think you are not \"judging.\"  That's exactly what you are doing.\n\nWould ANYONE be okay for your son?", "YTA.\n\nShe had a hard life growing up and learned how to be responsible at a young age, and you're wary of her? By saying to think hard about marrying her, you're essentially saying you don't trust her not to turn out like her family. You're punishing her for something that wasn't and will never be her fault. No wonder she doesn't want to get close to you.", "YTA.\n\nDon't claim to not judge when you clearly are judging.\n\nYour son loves this woman. If anyone deserves that, it's her.\n\n You know how she ends up just like her family? By you interfering in a loving relationship.", "Let's flip this....\nAITA? I really love my BF, let's call him Evan. We've been together for two years, we've talked, about marriage, and I think he's going to propose. We have a great relationship. \n\nBut, his family, especially his mother are judgemental, privileged, and classist. His mom is always dropping passive aggressive communication about single mothers, the poors, and how important \"family\" is.\n\nShe's never worked, never clipped a coupon, and is way overly involve with her kids lives. \nI'm very close to my grandma, she raised me while working three jobs. My future MIL is always taking nasty digs about my family even though she's never met, to my BF and even me.\nI'm worried my BF and his mom have boundaries issues.\n\n I know it is will be worse if we have kids..  I'm not sure we want kids but she has such a warped sense of family. My BF has told me his greatest greatest fear is turning out like his mom overbearing, controlling, snobby, and elitist.\nI've worked hard since I was a teenager and I'm proud of how far I've come. Am I as asshole for telling my BF I have reservations about marrying him because he over shares with his mother? And because his family acts like they're there the English royal family and not upper middle class snobs from the suburbs.", "So what is it about *Eva* that worries you? Because everything you listed isn't actually about her and isn't within her control. You're being extremely judgemental and she hasn't even done anything. YTA.", "YTA. I actually think your son shouldn't propose to Eva, because you sound like you'll be the mother-in-law from hell, and she deserves to have at least some family members who don't treat her terribly.\n\nAbsolutely nothing you mention is her fault. You see the effects of inter-generational poverty upon her life, and your response is to back away like she's infected or something. That's gross.", "YTA *Oh the horror*, your son wants to marry a self sufficient woman who has succeeded in life despite life throwing her curve balls along the way. Mind your business, I can understand why she doesn't want to open up to someone as judgemental and manipulative as you.", "YTA 100% and I feel bad for Eva.

Instead, she got you. \n\nI\u2019d love to read her list of red flags about you!", "YTA. \n\nShe is not her family and should not be judged for the choices past generations have made but for her own merit.\n\nIf you want to take a second for self-reflection, if that was the case then really *she* should be thinking long and hard before agreeing to marry your son. After all, just look at the judgemental AHs his parents turned out to be.", "YTA.  So this woman has managed to live her life despite a traumatic background and support herself financially and you think your son shouldn't marry her for those reasons?\n\nYou are precisely the kind of person I don't want to associate with: judgemental, classist, and snobby", "&#x200B;\n\nFortunately for your son people are not their family, she seems great. YTA", "Unfortunately yes YTA. I\u2019m her. Literally. I feel the judgement for her. I was abused and neglected and my wife knows my biggest fear is becoming my mom. But because of MY GRANDMA, I know I never will. The thing that REALLY saved me, an American black man, with my wife, a German white woman, was the fact that she had a taste of a hard life too. Her family, like you, were judgmental of me and at first I accepted it but eventually I realized that was from shame. If you keep this up you\u2019ll only make her feel like she should be ashamed of how she was raised which in turn will make her open up even less.", "YTA- she sounds like she overcame a lot with her family and you are being super judgey because she doesn\u2019t come from a family similar to yours. She probably hasn\u2019t opened up to you completely because having a \u201cnormal\u201d family or whatever you consider yours to be is very different than how she grew up. It\u2019s also hard to warm up to someone if you feel like you are being judged. She sounds very nice and responsible and if your son loves her that\u2019s all that matters. Instead of punishing her for her family welcome her into yours and make her feel more comfortable.", "YTA, \n\nSounds like she turned out great despite what life threw at her. \n\n>When it comes to them starting a family of their own.\n\nDo you even know if they want kids? As if people who have a great life never doubt themselves? wtf.", "YTA Instead of recognizing how far she has come , in spite of her background, you've chosen to judge her for things that were completely out of her control. She is not defined by her relatives.", "You should definitely tell him not to propose. Insist that he hold out for some entitled brat from a well off family who has never worked a day in her life. Show preference for the one whose only life goal is to become Insta-famous. /s\n\nYTA.", "YTA--God how awful that in your eyes I should be discarded because I have a shitty family.  I've also went no contact with many of them.  The fact that she went no contact means she is different and won't continue the cycle.  What a gross perspective of \"Eva\" when she sounds like a nice woman for your son.  You need to just be happy for him because she treats him well and then butt out.", "YTA\n\nCongrats to your son for finding a new family. I wish him all the happiness in the world. Eva has found herself a lovely gentleman who has turned out great despite his obvious narcissistic parents, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll break the cycle and make a wonderful loving father when he and his wife start a family of their own.", "YTA\n\nYou're judging the girl as unfit for your son because she's had a hard life and isn't as privileged as you are. That's just gross.", "YTA - you really think your son shouldn\u2019t marry a woman he clearly loves because she survived and overcame a shitty family situation.  Take heart, your son turned out to be a great person despite having a cruel and judgemental parent. It proves we are all our own people who make our own choices.", "Yta. You\u2019re judging her as not worthy by the choices the older generations in her family have made. Why don\u2019t you look at the person she\u2019s been in the 2 years you\u2019ve known her instead of focusing on (checks notes) her gma being impoverished (not Eva\u2019s fault), her mother having mental health issues (not Eva\u2019s fault), her not having a father (not Eva\u2019s fault), and her financially supporting herself throughout her life (admirable and shows strength, determination, and tenacity which are things you should want).  \n\nYou sound like the future MIL from hell.

First of all, never say anything negative about a future DIL or SIL. If they ever marry, there will always a wedge between you, your DIL and potential grandkids. Second don\u2019t do it because I have seen miserable marriages happen because the parents were against it which only pushed them together almost out of spite. All three examples ended in divorce.  It may be simply your son needs someone to love and she needs someone to love her. Don\u2019t punish her for the past she didn\u2019t control. She wants to break the viscous circle and he maybe the perfect person to Si so. Support him supporting her. He will come to a decision free of conflict from his parents. You will either be part of a wonderful story or there for you son should it tuen south. Lastly, when parents act like you are doing now, you are saying, in a back handed way, you didn\u2019t raise a man with good judgement and proper values. If true, then that is on you and your are too late to put in your two cents worth.", "YTA\n\nI truly don't understand how you can't see it, given how descriptive you could type it", "So basically you mean that she only deserves to live a life that she was born into, right? She's only allowed to be poor, have bad taste in men and be neglectful and abusive to her kids. Stay with \"her kind\". Is that it?", "I\u2019ve have lurked on this sub for a while and never commented, but YTA. By and large the biggest one I have seen on this sub, ever. So much so that I decided to actually comment on one of these posts for the first time.", "YTA and a huge one at that.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you would prefer your son marry someone from a \"picture perfect\" family that has never struggled financially. The fact that she is estranged from her family other than her grandmother has nothing to do with her relationship with your son. And what does her grandmother having her own struggles have to do with any of it? Should she have stayed in contact with the rest of her family (i.e., an abusive mother) just to be accepted by someone like you? She clearly has boundaries and is not willing to let people walk all over her. The fact that she has supported herself financially from a young age says that she understands the value of things and is a bit more responsible. You say that you admire her grandmother for working three jobs to support her children, but I find that hard to believe when you are using her poverty as a reason for your son to not marry Eva. All you are doing is judging her, and mostly for things that she had no control over.", "YTA\n\nHow's the view from your high and mighty position.\n\nAll you should care about is whether or not your son is happy or not, does she love him and treat him well.\n\nAll that other crap you mentioned doesn't matter, she's her own person.", "YTA. You list all the good qualities this girl has. You state that she wants to break the cycle of dysfunction in her family. Then you say you have concerns, which basically add up to, \"Yeah, but still...\"\nIt seems like this apple fell far from the tree and then rolled downhill even farther away. You should be supporting her efforts like your son is and modeling what a healthy family looks like.", "YTA.\n\nBased on everything you've posted here Eva seems like she's an amazing person who has overcome many adversities in life.", "YTA, you\u2019ve written a very complicated load of words when what you are trying to say is you think Eva is a gold digger who is not good enough for your son, he\u2019ll know that\u2019s what you\u2019ve said, you know that is what you\u2019ve said. Are you worrried about her embarrassing you socially? She seems stable, nice and able to succeed from a challenging background. Sounds like you may not be good enough for her, or where you intending on keeping your son for some sort of game of thrones family style union, big social impact, and are sad he\u2019s not marrying up to give you a kick up in your social status. Whatever reason YTA.", "YTA\n\nI don't see how anything you listed reflects badly on her. They're all positives, she sounds incredibly strong and capable. We can't control what cards we are dealt with in life, but she has made the most of it and I think you need to set aside your privilege and see her the way your son sees her. Coming from a broken home myself, yes for some it causes them to spiral, but both me and my siblings have used it as motivation to create peaceful lives for ourselves and our families. We know exactly what NOT to do.", "None of the things you stated are things that she had control over. Clearly despite the many faults you\u2019ve managed to find with her upbringing she\u2019s still managed to be self sufficient and rise above it.

YTA", "You: lists all this stuff about this poor woman's horrible family, with whom she has cut off contact for what is apparently very good reason\n\nAlso you: \"Because of her broken sense of family, I worry how this will be in the long run. When it comes to them starting a family of their own.\"\n\nWell, you know, you could always provide her with a better example. But apparently it's more fun to collect dirt on her and judge her upbringing.\n\nYTA. And I'd stop wondering why she's not opening up to you and doesn't want to get close to you. People like her can smell your sort of condescension from three houses down.", "YTA \n\nI was much like his soon to be fianc\u00e9, my family was not loving or supportive.

We don't get to choose our family. They're given to us and you can only hope you luck out with good people in your life. Just bc someone has crappy family members, doesn't make them crappy. I mean, look at what you just said. She basically had to take care of herself when she was younger. You do realize your son could be dating an irresponsible, lazy person, right?\n\nYou need to be more accepting. You said yourself she's sweet, respectful, and there's no issues. Maybe the reason why she doesn't want you meeting her family is bc she KNOWS you'll judge her like you're doing right now and she's scared. If you truly want to be welcoming then you need to be more accepting. Stop judging. We can't all have storybook families, though we certainly wish for it.", "None of the things you listed are in Eva's control.

It's clear you find her beneath you.\n\nYour choice:  alienate her and you alienate your son and future grandchildren, or embrace her and become the mother and family she never got to experience.", "YTA - Sounds like Eve knew who you are and was right about not getting close to you.  The little information you have about her you are using against her.  Like being independent and keeping your circle small is a bad thing.  You just don\u2019t want to like her and are grasping at straws but your opinion doesn\u2019t matter in any way.  Your son loves her and is going to marry her and he should cause she sounds strong, hardworking, and has a good head on her shoulders.  Not like you at all.", "You can tell the OP has no defense of her actions. She hasn\u2019t responded to a single comment.", "I don't get it. You haven't said a single bad word about Eva. In fact, you make her sound like she has overcome a lot of difficulty imposed on her by others. So what is the problem with her? That her mother was abusive? That sucks, but if Eva isn't, _why does that matter_?\n\nYTA", "YTA. You should be delighted, as this woman your son wants to marry has shown the strength of character to overcome and rise above adversity in her upbringing. The fact that her family background sucked or that she is estranged from people who were not good influences in her life is not a legit red flag.  \n\nAlso, being practical, how you react to her going into this marriage (because it is almost certain to happen\\*) will set the tone of your relationship with them for years, if not decades to come. If grandkids come along you will undoubtedly want to be an active part of their lives. But if you set a pattern now of being seen as hostile to her it will be hard to change, and that will not make her want to share her children with you.  Please welcome her into your family. It is in your own best interest. \n\n\\*I am speaking from experience. My FIL objected to my wife wanting to marry me for similar reasons. That early opposition of his tainted our relationship with him (and his grand-daughter) for years after. \n\nAfter 46 wonderful years together I think we proved him wrong. Giver your son's girl friend the benefit of the doubt and trust your son. If it turns out well you will reap rich rewards.", "YTA she had a rough life growing up.  Despite that she overcame her circumstances.  Now you are sitting here judging her for her families problems.  Problems she can\u2019t control.  Then complain you haven\u2019t met her family.  Maybe because she\u2019s not in contact or close with them so why would *you* meet them?  You say you aren\u2019t judging but you are.", "YTA- bc some ppl in great upbringings turn out terrible and some ppl in terrible upbringings turn out great. Its all about being able to learn what to do and what not to do. It seems a testament to her that she has risen above and has extra motivation to be successful. If mental health problems are genetic and they run in family that could be only valid concern", "YTA\n\nWhat's your actual problem with Eva? Because most of your criticisms are about circumstances beyond her control or about the fact that she is capable of financially supporting herself.", "YTA for sure those are not even valid concerns", "YTA. You have no right to judge that poor girl for the things that were out of her control in her past. She has overcome adversity and has supported herself only to be judged for it. I can see why she isn't very open with your family. This is what she feared and sure enough because how dare someone like her be in love with your son. You are in desperate need of self-reflection, and you should be ashamed of yourself. You're not concerned at all.

It isn\u2019t easy talking about one\u2019s upbringing. Some people will never know what it\u2019s like to have a family where unconditional love was never an option.

Im exactly like Eva. Similar upbringing and family situation. I was not close to my husbands family for the first 5 years. They too decided that my broken family spoke more about my character than actually paying attention to the things I do or how I acted.  \n\nWanna know how they finally came around and accepted me? My husband stopped speaking with them for 3 years. He wanted nothing to do with them after one too many instances of nothing we do being good enough. Then he got deathly ill. I was at the hospital by myself and didn\u2019t know if he was going to make it. He wouldn\u2019t admit it but I knew he was scared too and he needed his mom. I called her and told her to come immediately. Neither of us left his side for the next month. In that month she saw how much I loved him and took care of him.

I think any parent will harbor some concerns about their young adult children embarking on a big step like this, regardless of who the SO is, I know I would.\n\nBut, you do indeed come across as judgmental. You mention never having met her family but also acknowledge that she is estranged from all of them. So... obviously you would not have met them. I think one tactic you should consider is to see these things in a positive light. Eva is aware of her family's dysfunction and strives not to repeat it. She is so capable and independent, she has been self-sufficient financially when others were still very much receiving support from family.\n\nFeel free to have a convo but seriously, tread carefully.

She has some say in what happens going forward.  I think it shows great judgement on her part to have cut off her entire family, if they are as bad as it seems. I think her fear of turning out like her family is completely justified and another point in her favor.  She recognizes the issue and will keep conscious of it going forward.\n\nThe best thing you and your wife can do is provide an example to her of what a loving family relationship is like.  What you show Eva about how you love and respect your son and how you and your wife handle things provides her a basis on how to approach her own struggles.  If you and your wife can be very welcoming of Eva, you may be the best thing that has happened to her parent-wise.  So I'd cut down on the judgement of her and try to establish a deep relationship, especially your wife.\n\nI think it's fine to have fears but be very careful how you approach your son on this.  You need to recognize all Eva has done to get to where she is and be ready to help her with any future struggles rather than judging her on her background and what she went through.  Because if you do this wrong, you're going to set up a dynamic where it is your son and Eva against the world, and you end up in an adversarial relationship with them instead of being able to help and guide them.  Keep in mind, everything you say to your son will probably get back to Eva. So you don't want to poison that well before having a chance to get to really know her.  Think hard on that.

She is sweet and respectful to us. But I can tell she isn\u2019t fully opened up to us, and is hesitant to get close to me and our family. We\u2019ve never had any issues, fights, and have always been on good terms. My husband and I weren\u2019t sure how to approach her at first, because my son has explained to me her backstory as the two years have progressed. I\u2019m not judging, just concerned. \n\nRecently, he\u2019s been talking about proposing to her. I\u2019m happy for him that he\u2019s found love finally, but my husband and I brought some concerns to him. Before I explain my feelings, I\u2019ll try to explain her backstory. I haven\u2019t tried to be nosy, but my son told me and although Eva hasn\u2019t told us directly, he says she\u2019s pretty open about it in general. \n\n\n\n- Estranged from all of her family except her grandmother. Her grandmother is loud and struggles with her own things. But has always been there for her from what I\u2019m told. \n- She is the third generation to grow up without a father in her family. Her siblings have a different dad. And I guess her mother didn\u2019t even know who Eva\u2019s dad was. \n- She\u2019s supported herself financially from a young age\n- Her mother struggles with mental illness and was neglectful and abusive \n- Her grandmother has always lived in poverty. I admire that though because she worked three jobs to support her children as a single mother. \n\nThey\u2019ve been together two years, and we\u2019ve never met any of her family. My son has met her grandmother when he came over while she was still living there.  He told me that she was screaming at the neighbors and on the phone all the time. \nBecause of her broken sense of family, I worry how this will be in the long run. When it comes to them starting a family of their own. He told me Eva\u2019s biggest fear is \u201cturning out like her family\u201d and that worries me.

Granted I was in my 20s at that time and didn't really need a mom, but she was there for me with advice and guidance when I needed it.  Part of that allowed me to break that narcissistic cycle when I had my daughter.  I am incredibly proud that I was able to do that and will always be grateful for my MILs love and guidance.

Especially when it comes to someone who's home stressers are so horrible she only has contact with, what sounds like, a hermit of a woman with more years behind then ahead. \nSo if OP is an AH they are a verry soft AH.", "And, she has *literally* expressed that motivation to not be like her family. She may struggle, as all parents/partners/people, but it is the parents who think they have no baggage to deal with who end up harming their families. She knows she has to fight to be a good parent and partner. If only the majority understood that.", "In five years this woman is going to be on one of those forums for estranged parents going \"But I don't know WHY my son doesn't talk to me anymore! Grandparents' rights!\"", "This just reeks of \u201cshe\u2019s not good enough for us\u201d", "I honestly just think OP doesn\u2019t like this girl because she comes from a poor family.  Can\u2019t have the poor people leaking into her family.  Might damage their reputation.", "N T A and his mom, so clearly YTA here, desperately needs to mind her own snobbish, elitist business before things go downhill for her son. Who also desperately needs to get his head out of his ass and stop indulging and enabling his mothers disgusting behaviour.  Cuz that's exactly what mommy dearest is. Disgusting", "I*REALLY* hope you are \"Eva\" because if you are, you deserve to know this is what your MIL is like. I also hope... if you are, you show this post to \"Evan\", and make some big choices from there. \n\nIf not, I seriously hope she sees this.", "Other than the personal insults, obviously NTA.  Why wouldn't a girl take into consideration her relationship with in laws if that is going to be a major part of her life?? It would be quite naive NOT to do that.", "This is awesome.  Good way to put it all in perspective.", "Maybe she\u2019s from a different race and OP is racist? cuz this is ridiculous", "Her son wants to marry someone who came from poverty.  Pretty sure that is the ACTUAL concern here.  The poor people might come for their money or something.", "With comments as delusional as these, op definitely shouldn't respond", "I will be stealing thundertwat from you. Brilliant", "So, in summary, treat someone differently for things that happened to them and was never their fault. \n\nSeems a bit like assholish behavior to me.", "You're as bad as op", "So just because your family (that you obviously can\u2019t choose) is shitty, that makes you shitty too? Why wouldn\u2019t Eva have the right to be loved and to start a family just because she doesn\u2019t have a good background?", "Nice \u201ccommon sense.\u201d Most people just call that being a snob.", "the best answer.", "Maybe it\u2019s because of the reasoning that OP stated. It\u2019s all extremely judgmental", "Same, I gave an NTA and a perfectly reasonable explanation as to why it's NTA. The amount of downvotes I'm getting us almost laughable. People are so blind.", "This is where I am -- you marry a person's family, and I can't blame a person for encouraging their child to really think about that before marrying someone without any reliable family members.\n\nMaybe this makes me an AH but I grew up in a stable family and I wanted to marry someone who also did; I've seen too many marriages damaged by external pressures from unstable family. I've also seen the undeniable benefits to a couple when they have supportive family on both sides. My husband felt the same way, and our families were part of the appeal of marrying each other.\n\nThat's not to say stable families are only two parent, one marriage households from financially comfortable backgrounds. But if you enjoy the benefits of being raised in a stable household, you do have to think about what it means to marry outside of that before you do so.", "Don't know why you'd make that bet given that she says he's her son.", "Re: mental illness - I understand this fear because I am living the reality of family members with tough diagnoses. But here's the thing: no one looking at my family from the outside would have ever predicted that mental illness would crop up in such devastating ways. \n\nOP: Blowing up your relationship with your son, his wife and their potential children over the *potential* of mental health issues cropping up is a bad, bad idea. \n\nA better question to have asked was: are you guys aligned on how much to interract/help with your inlaws? But I wouldn't ask it now; I'd backpedal as hard as I could and work to make her feel welcome.", "Holding against her that she supported herself from a young age? What is this, damn aristocats?\n\nThat woman has issues and I mean OP.\n\nEdit: YTA", "Not that I agree, but: we do what we know when under pressure. She grew up fast, she'll make the grands grow up too fast. Or son will wear himself out taking care of the kids on his own.\n\nOP doesn't realize gf has already broken the cycle in a lot of ways, and if she has a good relationship with son she will be open to other ways. I actually worry she's gonna be the kind of MIL that undermines DIL and goes against wishes when it comes to grandkids.", "That's what it sounds like to me too \u2639", "Missing missing reasons.  I see it already.", "Wrong side of the tracks!\n\nOP, you sound like the villain in a movie from the fifties.", "Totally does", "It certainly does.", "It honestly would not surprise me. OP seems like one of those people who, no matter what girl her son dates, will never find them good enough.", "Alas, I'm not Eva but my first husband's family had some people like OP. Not his mother (she was an angel here on earth) but his grandmothers and sisters acted as if I was contaminating the pure bloodline with my working class immigrant mixed race background. \n\nThe family that had been working class immigrants two generations back. I will say my ex husband wasn't great person, but he cut that crap real fast. He'd cut out anyone who talked shit about me or our kids. He was quick to remind his grandmother she grew up in the slums on the lower east side and she married the son of sharecroppers.", "I\u2019m wondering if this is the case as well. \n\nINFO: Is Eva of a different ethnicity to you, OP?", "This was my first thought as well", "Coming from you, that is taken as praise.", "It\u2019s not about her being shitty or not having a right to be loved, it\u2019s about the fact that it\u2019s hard to overcome generational trauma and that it\u2019s going to affect him and his future children in unexpected ways. I come from a shitty background too and I speak from experience. I\u2019ve had countless hours of therapy yet I still manage to somehow fuck up every relationship I have. There are always exceptions,  but I don\u2019t think the mother is wrong to be concerned.", "Well I thought so. Apparently however, the grammatical error in the last sentence put a bunch of people off. Only reason I can see for the downvotes. Cheers!", "Okay and? It\u2019s her son and she\u2019s being protective. His girl has came from generations of broken families and she doesn\u2019t want that for her son. \n\nWould you let your kid marry a criminal because you don\u2019t want to \u201cjudge\u201d them?", "I don\u2019t really mind, I don\u2019t respect anyone on this god awful app. I use this to kill time at work, makes the day go by arguing with loser on the internet", "In our current system, a \"stable family\" literally can only be financially comfortable two-parent households from financially comfortable, two-parent households, who in turn are themselves all from financially-comfortable two-parent households.\n\nWe've set it up such that this is the cultural expectation, and you will be ostracized otherwise.  It's also nearly impossible to be financially comfortable these days without two or more significant incomes.", "I'm not telling her to blow up the relationship, and think they should just shut it with all of their \"concerns\" until the son and gf come to them.\n\nI'm just saying that the mental illness is the only legitimate concern, but not for the reason OP wants it to be.", "Working for a living is after all for the lesser amongst us.", "Well, I'm still glad that you flipped it around. Hopefully, OP sees this and realizes she's wrong before she loses her son forever.", "I\u2019m sorry for what you went through, but we also cannot put our own experience and take it as a hard truth. I have a lot of childhood trauma but I think I am pretty well now and I\u2019m proud of myself. I have an amazing boyfriend that helped me and I could not ask for someone better, and I\u2019m totally ready to marry that guy.

The girl in question isn't a criminal.", "She isn\u2019t a criminal, she\u2019s a victim of abuse. Judging someone for their own mistakes is fine vs the parents mistakes is weird. HORRIBLE comparison. One is your own fault.\n\nIt also depends on the crime! I\u2019m technically a criminal myself and so is my bf. Same w my parents, so they don\u2019t really care!", "Hahaha I agree, even if they don't make sense they're dramatic.", "I don't disagree with you -- I also don't think it's wrong to consider a partner's family when choosing a spouse, or to encourage your child to consider the same when they're doing so.\n\nMarriage is about love, but it's also a social contract built around the idea of building a stable household. This is especially the case if a couple wants to have children.\n\nStable two-parent households are the ideal for a reason; they consistently have the best outcomes for the subsequent generations. Given our fractured social environment your family is often the only social group you can rely on for any sort of support. It's not wrong to point out to your child that they won't get that from both sides before they make that choice.\n\nIntergenerational poverty is a terrible thing, but that doesn't mean we should pretend it doesn't have a real impact on long-term family stability over generations.", "I wonder whether she's allowed to enter the palace via the servants entrance or the deliveries hole.", "I speak English too dude.

We're also both from families that value marriage because if you aren't rich, like you said, the stability offered by the union and extended family is invaluable. \n\nBoth my husband's and my own families that existed prior to our marriage have been made stronger because of our union, and any children we have will benefit from having two stable families they're already a part of. \n\nPeople can pretend the stability offered by considering these factors when they choose a spouse aren't real, but that doesn't change the fact that similarity of family structure is a major part of marital success.", "That was the word I was looking for!", "You can think whatever you want, that doesn\u2019t bother me, this is what I think.", "Lol, \"deliveries hole\"", "Well hopefully you'll never have kids.", "I love this term.", "I plan on having 3 actually!
