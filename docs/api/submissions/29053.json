We have recently relocated to his home town with our 2 kids 15m and 3m. We both work fulltime jobs. On a typical weekday we both wake up at 5am. His day: 5:30 gets out of bed showers shave gets dressed leaves for work at 6:15 returns from work at 5pm (usually) Monday and Wednesday helps coach his brother in-laws little league soccer team comes home at about 7:30. My days: out of bed at 5-5:30 clean kitchen from night before or do a load of laundry if I cooked that night. prep toddler meals for the day Shower get dressed then start working about 5:30-6:00 Toddler is usually up at 7:30-8:00 get him dressed for the day. feed breakfast. take dogs out feed dogs. clean up from breakfast. switch over load of laundry. work while toddler plays with toys, periodically interact with toddler and give snacks stop work at about 1:00 feed toddler lunch take dogs and toddler outside for about 30 min put toddler sown for nap. start working again around 2pm about 3:00 toddler wakes up cranky finishes nap on my lap while I work. 4pm teen home from school rings doorbell wakes up toddler. monday and wednesday 5pm stops working to cook dinner. 7:30 husband is home and I starts working again. husband takes care of toddler while I work until 10:30 pm shower then go to bed. Tuesday Thursday and Friday husband cooks dinner and i finish work around 8:-8:30. Saturday and Sundays we both are off from work. since he decided to start coaching he has games on the weekends. The games last about an hour but he always ends up it his sisters house for half the day drinking and smoking weed with them. I do not drink or smoke. I usually spend the weekend cleaning the house doing laundry and working on my home reno projects. I also go grocery shopping. This weekend I decided to paint several areas of the house. I painted living room, hallway, and stairway, I also hung up art work in my home office. So 10pm we climb into bed and husband takes deep sigh and says \"the new pain. looks great, I wish I had free time to work on home projects\" Annoyed I said \"you do your just chose to do other activities.\" this lead to an argument and him accusing me of not respecting his coaching or anything he does. This morning he woke up upset I didn't wash his laundry (my husband and teen are responsible for their own laundry). he said I was home all weekend and could have it least washed his work clothes. I was not hime all weekend and was in and our running errands. needless to say that lead to another argument when I reminded him of his free time. so am I the assholes?\n\n\nEdit: sometimes he takes the children with him to the game and his sisters but most of the time I keep the toddler with me because I don't want him around that. I have little say with the teen as he's my step son.\n\nEdit 2: teen does have a key. he usually forgets it or just doesn't feel like taking it out of his bag. Husband does do some house work. and maintenance but since he started working fulltime again it has been far less than before. And neither teen nor husband clean after themselves much. like leaving cereal or condiments out or not wiping the counter after making a sandwich or spilling something on counter. Stepping over things they've dropped. The toddler does clean after himself.", "created_utc": 1697457999, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1794fnu/aita_for_twlling_my_husband_he_has_just_as_much/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You handle the home repair and upgrades (job #3).\nAnd this fucker has the audacity to suggest you need to be a laundress too? You need a vacation, far away, let him figure it out for a week or two. I'm sure after 1 day he will be begging you to come back. Don't. Let him experience what life will be like when you inevitably crack and make for the hills because you're exhausted, unappreciated, and taken for granted.

He was upset that I was leaving his clothes folded in a pile on the folding table. I said \"you could put them away.\" When he asked why I don't put them away, I said \"because I wash, dry, hang, and fold all the laundry. This is where I'm putting it. You're a 36-year-old man, you can put it away.\" I stood my ground for this a couple times, he now puts it away. \n\nContinue to stand your ground and to point out that you're being productive while he's smoking and drinking.

As a semi-recent new parent I get the need for some downtime.

He places more value on his fun hobbies of coaching a little league soccer team and then socialising (without you) over the household chores and DIY.

Of course you're bringing up your youngest to be a courteous, contributing member of the household.\n\nCoaching is a hobby, a volunteer of free time. None of that contributes to the running and well-being of your household. It seems as though your husband views his few hours/week of cooking (but not the clean-up) and child minding as his share of chores. Sad that he couldn't find 3 hours out of his 48 hour weekend to do his laundry. Not sure how that is your fault.\n\nNTA You need to work this out somehow, whether it's counseling or a calm discussion of your list of chores and his household contributions. On the bright side, 3m will be in all day school in 2 or 3 years, which will allow you more time to work during the day uninterrupted.", "NTA. \n\nYou're not the one disrespecting what he does, he is.
