{"id": 18503, "submission_id": "13v4odb", "title": "AITA for not agreeing to punish my stepson?", "selftext": "\nSo before my wife and I met, she lost her daughter five years ago, when the daughter was in highschool and my stepson Evan was in elementary school. Needless to say, her passing hit their family really hard, Evan especially. They had a very close sibling bond, it\u2019s like he lost a piece of himself. As a result, Evan (now 15) keeps a photo of her in a locket on a chain. To the outside observer, it just looks like a normal necklace, but it\u2019s his most valuable possession.\n\nLast Thursday, Evan came home with a detention slip for the next day after school. The offense was listed as \u2018uncouth language and severe insulting of another student\u2019 or something along  those lines. I asked him to explain what happened, and this is how he described it:\n\nApparently, at the start of his gym class, he took off his necklace and put it with his hoodie against the wall. Another student, Kayla, picked up his necklace and started taunting him about it. She asked if it was his girlfriend\u2019s picture, and when Evan said it was his sister, she said \u201cthat makes sense, only gay guys wear necklaces after all, haha\u201d\n\nEvan tried to take the necklace back, but she and her friends tossed it around and played a sort of keep away with it. When he eventually got it back with the help of a friend of his, he cussed her and her friends out quite loudly. I\u2019m not sure what exactly he shouted at her, but it did, by Evan\u2019s own admission, include \u201cf\\*ck you\u201d \u201cb\\*tch\u201d \u201cc\\*nt\u201d and \u201cpiece of sh\\*t\u201d (without the censoring of course).\n\nBecause he swore a lot and shouted, the school decided that he was the aggressor in the situation and issued him an after school detention. Kayla has not been punished so far as I know. I reluctantly signed the detention slip because I didn\u2019t want to cause trouble between Evan and the school administration. Neither my wife or myself have given him any other punishment.\n\nYesterday, my wife came to me in private and told me that she\u2019d been thinking things over, and wanted to give Evan extra chores as a punishment. She said that while what Kayla did was awful and cruel, his language was unacceptable. She put special emphasis on him calling a girl a \u201cb*tch\u201d and said that that word was particularly harmful to young women. (I am not a woman so I don\u2019t know if this is true). I told her that he already was punished; he had detention. She said that he needs to know that we don\u2019t approve either, that some punishment needs to come from us.\n\nShe eventually gave up, but now she\u2019s being a bit cold/distant, and I\u2019m wondering if I did something wrong and if I should agree to punish Evan.

To taunt a young man over a necklace with the picture of his dead sister?

Period. Also, the school\u2019s logic reeks of sexism.

If she doesn't want to be called a bad name, she shouldn't make it fit her behavior.", "Definitely NTA. Kayla took that necklace (that meant a ton to him) and made fun of him for it. She was the aggressor. You take her out of the situation and nothing would\u2019ve happened. Him getting detention is enough. Your wife wanting him to do extra chores is way too much.

While I am firmly in the camp of misogynistic swear words being a huge deal (especially B and C words) what that girl did and said are so scummy and hateful that I would not punish my kid for saying that if he had never said them before. \n\nInstead I would have a conversation with him about the history of those words, why they are misogynistic and discuss better ways to express himself when everyone is calm. He\u2019s 15. The goal is to raise a kind and caring person, not knee/jerk punish. \n\nAnd ESH for not going to the school and demanding any student who weaponized calling someone gay to be punished. And for bullying your kid. That behavior is absolutely horrible. What a shitty group of mean girls. \n\nThere\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d let my kid\u2019s bully get away with this shit.

Teach him the lesson your wife (and every woman on the planet) want's him to learn and then let it go.  No extra chores no additional punishments- he was already punished by the detentions.\n\nThen you and your wife need to write a joint letter to the principal letting her know that your son being singled out for punishment while the instigator was apparently let off scott free was unjust and should there be any more trouble with this young woman again you'll take it to the school board. \n\nNTA but Kayla and the principal and to a lesser degree your wife for being cold and distant because you stuck up for your stepson are.", "NTA.", "If your wife wants punishment, force him to sit down and have a talk on how to properly unload on someone who uses your dead sister as a fucking gag so he doesn't need to resort to gendered language next time.\n\nGive him the shit sandwich - here's what you did well, here's what we'd change, here's what else you like.\n\nWith the wofe, teach the kid how to handle this sort of outrageous shit.", "NTA Mom was concerned about calling a young girl named.

These girls bullied him in the meanest possible way. There need to be consequences. Enough teens already took their life due to bullying. Your wife is an even bigger AH.

Though I would have a talk with your son about not using misogynistic insults like the B and C words. Though I understand their use is common among teenage boys, it's still something that you should have a talk to him about. Your wife is correct that this language is very harmful to young women. You don't need to punish him at home, but you do need to have a talk with him. Consider posting to r/AskWomen asking for an explanation on why these words are so hurtful if you don't understand. I don't think you were necessarily wrong for not wanting to punish your stepson, but I do see how she might feel hurt by you not recognizing that the language he used is harmful to women. \n\nYour son wasn't in the wrong to get upset.

You also definitely need to make a huge statement to the school by demanding they bring in the other children\u2019s parents to a meeting and ask them if they are ok teaching their children that stealing and making fun of a persons deceased sibling ok. They need to be punished at school too.", "NTA\nKayla instigated it and as for the name calling, truth hurts.", "NTA but here's a better response for son to use:\n\nAnd I should care about your opinion because...You're not exactly president Obama. FYI Being gay is not an insult. I'd rather be flamming then stone cold like you.", "NTA. So really she\u2019s allowing her son to be bullied by the girls that think they can get away with it. Mom of the year right there. Your wife is TA.", "NAH your balancing understand his grief and also not allowing him to be a dick. Your wife needs to talk to him to have him understand why his language is unacceptable and how he doesn\u2019t get to lash out like that. It\u2019s understandable but it isn\u2019t okay or acceptable.", "As a teacher, I agree. His language was inappropriate, but does not cancel out the instigating behaviour of the girl. What she\u2019s learned from this is she can bully people and they\u2019ll get punished for fighting back. My guess is the school knows her family and it\u2019s easier to punish the victim rather than deal with them. OP absolutely needs to step up and make that harder for them.", "There isn\u2019t a need for punishing him for his language or handling of the situation at all.\n\nIf it was anything not concerning a dead, sick, or hurt relatives I\u2019d be fine with it then, but this girl acted out of line completely and deserved everything said to her", "I don\u2019t think he deserves a lecture about the history of the words is necessary at all.\n\nI think it should just be that while they understand why he used that language it shouldn\u2019t become the norm to resolve conflicts (unless it is a conflict of the same personal magnitude)", "Thank you!  An actually reasonable response", "The problem isn\u2019t calling him gay. It\u2019s disrespecting him and his dead sister.", "It\u2019s because, even though she\u2019s the biological parent, we\u2019ve been trying to make a conscious effort to be equal parents in his life. We don\u2019t make decisions about parenting without consulting the other first, which is why she came to me instead of just giving him the chores. At least, that\u2019s the logic I\u2019d assume.", "Schools (in America) almost always protect the bully", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "I\u2019d definitely say it\u2019s okay in this situation. Sure, maybe not \u201cacceptable\u201d on school or public grounds, but if you don\u2019t show someone respect and treat them like dirt while disrespecting them and their dead sister, you have whatever is coming to you", "And what about picking it up with the school to address the girl\u2019s homophobia and bullying?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude44", "That\u2019s fair enough. I\u2019m glad that she allowed you input because it\u2019s insane to punish him for standing up to a bully in a non-violent manner and I\u2019d argue these girls behavior is way more traumatizing than being called nasty words after being a nasty person would. \n\nBut I digress, I\u2019m glad you prevented your step son from being taught he shouldn\u2019t stand up for himself, because that\u2019s what he would be taught if you punished him for this. Women can be bullies, abusers, assaulted too and men should never be taught to just take it because it\u2019s a woman hurting them.", "Okay you are all over this thread, I feel like you are the girl who bullied him \ud83d\ude02", "True, but her hateful words centered around things which aren't a choice. His words centered around her behavior - which is absolutely a choice.\n\nNot the same.", "Hateful words from the one being abused is called reactive.  Not the same in this case.", "Yea Op I think you actually need to bring up wanting this girl punished to the school. I would go so far as to say YWBTA if you don't."]}
