Needless to say, her passing hit their family really hard, Evan especially. They had a very close sibling bond, it\u2019s like he lost a piece of himself. As a result, Evan (now 15) keeps a photo of her in a locket on a chain. To the outside observer, it just looks like a normal necklace, but it\u2019s his most valuable possession.\n\nLast Thursday, Evan came home with a detention slip for the next day after school. The offense was listed as \u2018uncouth language and severe insulting of another student\u2019 or something along  those lines. I asked him to explain what happened, and this is how he described it:\n\nApparently, at the start of his gym class, he took off his necklace and put it with his hoodie against the wall. Another student, Kayla, picked up his necklace and started taunting him about it. She asked if it was his girlfriend\u2019s picture, and when Evan said it was his sister, she said \u201cthat makes sense, only gay guys wear necklaces after all, haha\u201d\n\nEvan tried to take the necklace back, but she and her friends tossed it around and played a sort of keep away with it. When he eventually got it back with the help of a friend of his, he cussed her and her friends out quite loudly. I\u2019m not sure what exactly he shouted at her, but it did, by Evan\u2019s own admission, include \u201cf\\*ck you\u201d \u201cb\\*tch\u201d \u201cc\\*nt\u201d and \u201cpiece of sh\\*t\u201d (without the censoring of course).\n\nBecause he swore a lot and shouted, the school decided that he was the aggressor in the situation and issued him an after school detention. Kayla has not been punished so far as I know. I reluctantly signed the detention slip because I didn\u2019t want to cause trouble between Evan and the school administration. Neither my wife or myself have given him any other punishment.\n\nYesterday, my wife came to me in private and told me that she\u2019d been thinking things over, and wanted to give Evan extra chores as a punishment. She said that while what Kayla did was awful and cruel, his language was unacceptable. She put special emphasis on him calling a girl a \u201cb*tch\u201d and said that that word was particularly harmful to young women. (I am not a woman so I don\u2019t know if this is true). I told her that he already was punished; he had detention. She said that he needs to know that we don\u2019t approve either, that some punishment needs to come from us.\n\nShe eventually gave up, but now she\u2019s being a bit cold/distant, and I\u2019m wondering if I did something wrong and if I should agree to punish Evan.

If she doesn't want to be called a bad name, she shouldn't make it fit her behavior.", "Definitely NTA. Kayla took that necklace (that meant a ton to him) and made fun of him for it. She was the aggressor. You take her out of the situation and nothing would\u2019ve happened. Him getting detention is enough. Your wife wanting him to do extra chores is way too much.

He\u2019s 15. The goal is to raise a kind and caring person, not knee/jerk punish. \n\nAnd ESH for not going to the school and demanding any student who weaponized calling someone gay to be punished.

Teach him the lesson your wife (and every woman on the planet) want's him to learn and then let it go.  No extra chores no additional punishments- he was already punished by the detentions.\n\nThen you and your wife need to write a joint letter to the principal letting her know that your son being singled out for punishment while the instigator was apparently let off scott free was unjust and should there be any more trouble with this young woman again you'll take it to the school board. \n\nNTA but Kayla and the principal and to a lesser degree your wife for being cold and distant because you stuck up for your stepson are.", "NTA.", "If your wife wants punishment, force him to sit down and have a talk on how to properly unload on someone who uses your dead sister as a fucking gag so he doesn't need to resort to gendered language next time.\n\nGive him the shit sandwich - here's what you did well, here's what we'd change, here's what else you like.\n\nWith the wofe, teach the kid how to handle this sort of outrageous shit.", "NTA Mom was concerned about calling a young girl named.

You don't need to punish him at home, but you do need to have a talk with him. Consider posting to r/AskWomen asking for an explanation on why these words are so hurtful if you don't understand. I don't think you were necessarily wrong for not wanting to punish your stepson, but I do see how she might feel hurt by you not recognizing that the language he used is harmful to women. \n\nYour son wasn't in the wrong to get upset.

Punishment has been done. No need to punish him a second time. Talk it through with him for sure, but my approach has been to avoid double punishment with our kids.\n\nI would also consider a follow up with the school though around the homophobic language etc that the other person was using and ensure that they were also punished appropriately because punishing your son and not the girl is absolutely not on.", "Even if your wife does not approve, I approve, and I'm a woman (well, non-binary, but in terms of being subjected to hateful language aimed specifically at women, yup, been there). The most healthy and rational thing to do in this situation is to talk to your son about how calling a woman a bitch, even if she is a really vile, disgusting and homophobic bully, hurts not only her but also all the random bystander girls who could have overheard the shouting. Bitch is a very gendered insult, it attacks the woman's identity more than it does her behaviour. Teach him some creative non-gendered insults instead, like shit-maggot, rotten little hairball or piss-drinking fuckface. Take him out for dinner. File a report against the bully for effectively stealing your son's belongings while on the school grounds, harassment and discrimination on basis of sexuality (if your school is progressive enough to punish for that). See if the incident was caught on camera and if there are eye witnesses. If this girl never learns that what she did was wrong, she might grow up into an abusive monster, and it will be the school's fault for encouraging shit behaviour like that. Oh, and punishing your son any further is absolutely out of question. What both him and the girl need is a discussion about why sexist and homophobic language are both wrong, as well as stealing someone's things and being a bully. It really sucks that the way grown-ups, both parents and the school staff, respond to kids doing or saying something wrong is oftentimes either \"nothing\" or \"immediate punishment\", and not, you know, \"educating a child on why it was wrong and giving them a safer outlet for whatever issues they are having, with a good helping of therapy\".", "This is the first thing that went through my mind.

It actually sounds decently healthy, as far as that part of communication goes. Meaning, she didn't pull the, \"I'm the mom, you're just a stepdad.\" Card. And he's being treated as an equal parent. Without knowing more of the family dynamic, we're not sure if the closeness of OP and his stepson.
