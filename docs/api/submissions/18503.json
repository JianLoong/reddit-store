{"id": 18503, "submission_id": "13v4odb", "title": "AITA for not agreeing to punish my stepson?", "selftext": "\nSo before my wife and I met, she lost her daughter five years ago, when the daughter was in highschool and my stepson Evan was in elementary school. Needless to say, her passing hit their family really hard, Evan especially. They had a very close sibling bond, it\u2019s like he lost a piece of himself. As a result, Evan (now 15) keeps a photo of her in a locket on a chain. To the outside observer, it just looks like a normal necklace, but it\u2019s his most valuable possession.\n\nLast Thursday, Evan came home with a detention slip for the next day after school. The offense was listed as \u2018uncouth language and severe insulting of another student\u2019 or something along  those lines. I asked him to explain what happened, and this is how he described it:\n\nApparently, at the start of his gym class, he took off his necklace and put it with his hoodie against the wall. Another student, Kayla, picked up his necklace and started taunting him about it. She asked if it was his girlfriend\u2019s picture, and when Evan said it was his sister, she said \u201cthat makes sense, only gay guys wear necklaces after all, haha\u201d\n\nEvan tried to take the necklace back, but she and her friends tossed it around and played a sort of keep away with it. When he eventually got it back with the help of a friend of his, he cussed her and her friends out quite loudly. I\u2019m not sure what exactly he shouted at her, but it did, by Evan\u2019s own admission, include \u201cf\\*ck you\u201d \u201cb\\*tch\u201d \u201cc\\*nt\u201d and \u201cpiece of sh\\*t\u201d (without the censoring of course).\n\nBecause he swore a lot and shouted, the school decided that he was the aggressor in the situation and issued him an after school detention. Kayla has not been punished so far as I know. I reluctantly signed the detention slip because I didn\u2019t want to cause trouble between Evan and the school administration. Neither my wife or myself have given him any other punishment.\n\nYesterday, my wife came to me in private and told me that she\u2019d been thinking things over, and wanted to give Evan extra chores as a punishment. She said that while what Kayla did was awful and cruel, his language was unacceptable. She put special emphasis on him calling a girl a \u201cb*tch\u201d and said that that word was particularly harmful to young women. (I am not a woman so I don\u2019t know if this is true). I told her that he already was punished; he had detention. She said that he needs to know that we don\u2019t approve either, that some punishment needs to come from us.\n\nShe eventually gave up, but now she\u2019s being a bit cold/distant, and I\u2019m wondering if I did something wrong and if I should agree to punish Evan.

To taunt a young man over a necklace with the picture of his dead sister? Have the girl, and her parents, called into the office and ask them if they feel their daughter and her friends should be allowed to get away scot free over such behaviour?", "NTA\n\nParents don\u2019t get to unilaterally punish children. Period. Also, the school\u2019s logic reeks of sexism. Kayla gets to steal and taunt your stepson about his dead sister, but he gets punished for yelling and cursing (which is perfectly justified imo).", "NTA. I\u2019m a woman and he doesn\u2019t need punishment. He needs conversation. Checking in on how he\u2019s feeling and coming up with a plan for what he could have done differently. I would also demand something be done to Kayla because she was absolutely being an AH", "Nta\n\nThe girl is lucky that harsh words were all he used. That's a situation where I don't think I'd punish him if he got the necklace back by force. That girl is a bully, so she earned any and all cruel words he said to her.", "NTA, he already got punished and Kayla deserved to get cussed out", "NTA \n\n\nMy argument is that someone who taunts another person with their dead relatives keepsakes deserves to be called a bitch.", "NTA if your son told you the truth, Kayla deserved every word, and she should have been in detention herself. \n\nYes, those words are harmful. So was her behavior, including her blatant homophobic attack on your kid. So I have ZERO sympathy for her. If she doesn't want to be called a bad name, she shouldn't make it fit her behavior.", "Definitely NTA. Kayla took that necklace (that meant a ton to him) and made fun of him for it. She was the aggressor. You take her out of the situation and nothing would\u2019ve happened. Him getting detention is enough. Your wife wanting him to do extra chores is way too much. Detention is plenty punishment on its own.", "NTA - he\u2019s been punished enough between the actual aggressor getting away with her actions and the detentions. Also, not a huge fan of boys calling girls btchs but in this case she was acting like one.", "NTA. I am not condoning his language. However the school has already administered a punishment. Given the circumstances, I don\u2019t think punishing him further is needed.", "NTA. He was being bullied. It's unfair that the bully didn't get punished at school. but your stepson should not get in trouble at home. Just talking to him about language is all that 's needed.", "NTA. He is being punished already", "NTA for no additional punishment but ESH for failing to stand up for your son. \n\nHe did NOT say those things unprovoked. While I am firmly in the camp of misogynistic swear words being a huge deal (especially B and C words) what that girl did and said are so scummy and hateful that I would not punish my kid for saying that if he had never said them before. \n\nInstead I would have a conversation with him about the history of those words, why they are misogynistic and discuss better ways to express himself when everyone is calm. He\u2019s 15. The goal is to raise a kind and caring person, not knee/jerk punish. \n\nAnd ESH for not going to the school and demanding any student who weaponized calling someone gay to be punished. And for bullying your kid. That behavior is absolutely horrible. What a shitty group of mean girls. \n\nThere\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d let my kid\u2019s bully get away with this shit. I\u2019d make it a hill to die on. \n\nIf swearing on school grounds is cause for detention, fine. But bullying should have a MUCH worse punishment. Why aren\u2019t they enforcing zero tolerance for bullying? And for hate speech?\n\nYour poor kid got bullied, traumatized and teased, and when he broke and responded he\u2019s the ONLY ONE WHO GOT PUNISHED?!? That\u2019s some serious bullshit. (Not condoning what he said, but no matter what he said her behavior caused the entire problem to start with.)", "NAH. I understand everyone\u2019s perspective here and while it\u2019s not for you to override his mom, I understand why you are sympathetic to him.\n\nI do hope you guys go back to the school though and make a big stink about why the administrators think it\u2019s okay for this girl to take someone\u2019s personal property and be homophobic.", "NTA stepson doesn't need to be punished for being angry but I think a conversation with your stepson about the words used to insult the girl is necessary", "Tell your wife that the two of you need to sit down with Evan and explain to him why those words are harmful and how he should never say them-- how would he feel if someone had said those words to his sister.  Tell him you understood how he felt but it was still wrong just as what Kayla did was wrong.  That's it.  Teach him the lesson your wife (and every woman on the planet) want's him to learn and then let it go.  No extra chores no additional punishments- he was already punished by the detentions.\n\nThen you and your wife need to write a joint letter to the principal letting her know that your son being singled out for punishment while the instigator was apparently let off scott free was unjust and should there be any more trouble with this young woman again you'll take it to the school board. \n\nNTA but Kayla and the principal and to a lesser degree your wife for being cold and distant because you stuck up for your stepson are.", "NTA.", "If your wife wants punishment, force him to sit down and have a talk on how to properly unload on someone who uses your dead sister as a fucking gag so he doesn't need to resort to gendered language next time.\n\nGive him the shit sandwich - here's what you did well, here's what we'd change, here's what else you like.\n\nWith the wofe, teach the kid how to handle this sort of outrageous shit.", "NTA Mom was concerned about calling a young girl named. But the young girl called her son gay. Mom is more concerned about the girl then her own son. You need to talk to the school. Support your son.", "I don't think you're an asshole but you and your wife need to sit down with your stepson and explain to him the language he used is offensive and demeaning. It's okay to lose your cool but you can't fly off the handle and demean another person because you're angry. It's a lesson everyone has to learn, take it as an opportunity to have this discussion.", "NTA.\n\nWife really said \u201cshe can be homophobic but I draw my line at cuss words.\u201d", "YTA \n But not for not wanting to punish him, that was actually good. You didn\u2019t stand up for him at school and just let it go because it was easier. You need to make that right and contact the principal and if that doesn\u2019t help the school board. These girls bullied him in the meanest possible way. There need to be consequences. Enough teens already took their life due to bullying. Your wife is an even bigger AH. Her son is the victim of bullying and she wants to punish him because he started to defend himself. What is wrong with her. Does she want to loose her son as well? \nHe called the girl a bi** because she was a bi**. \nNow get up your behind in gear and make it right. Contact the school and let them know that you will not be silent while your son is being bullied and that you don\u2019t stand for victim punishment.", "NTA. Your wife is right that \"c\\*nt\" and \"b\\*itch\" are used against young women in a particularly unpleasant way but  this is exactly the time to show your son some grace.", "NTA. Though I would have a talk with your son about not using misogynistic insults like the B and C words. Though I understand their use is common among teenage boys, it's still something that you should have a talk to him about. Your wife is correct that this language is very harmful to young women. You don't need to punish him at home, but you do need to have a talk with him. Consider posting to r/AskWomen asking for an explanation on why these words are so hurtful if you don't understand. I don't think you were necessarily wrong for not wanting to punish your stepson, but I do see how she might feel hurt by you not recognizing that the language he used is harmful to women. \n\nYour son wasn't in the wrong to get upset.
