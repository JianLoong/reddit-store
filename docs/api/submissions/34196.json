She attempted to use you, as if you were something other than human.", "NTA at all! I used to haaaaate when I worked in retail at a children\u2019s store, and people used to comment, \u201coh if you don\u2019t behave that lady is going to kick you out.\u201d Um try parenting your own children???", "I have a disability and get stares from lots of children. The thought of being used as a disciplinary tool is simultaneously all too plausible and also heartbreaking--I love kids and wish they weren't afraid of the way I look! You should NEVER let anyone use you this way. Keep standing up for yourself. If a parent can't explain why their kid's behavior is wrong, there's either a) not a real problem or b) a skill they need to work on. NTA", "NTA. She should be using her own authority to discipline her child, not implying the responsibility belongs to someone else. What's she going to do when she's alone with the child? \"You have to behave or we'll go to the shops and find someone for you to be scared of\"?", "NTA. You were replying honestly AND IMO you were teaching that child that other adults are not scary, mean people.\n\nMy husband was in police enforcement for 50 years. He is one of the kindest gentlest people I've ever known. He can bring the hammer down when necessary, but usually only in the worst circumstances. He HATED it when he was in uniform and usually women would point him out and say \"that cop will deal with you.\"\n\nThat behavior is poor parenting and that kid will work around his mother soon.\n\nWhen my kids made me angry I remember telling them that \"I am too angry to decide on your punishment right now. GO to your room.\" Then when I would calm down we would discuss and there were always punishments. 20 years later, I suspect the \"not knowing\" about what the punishment would be was always worse than whatever the restriction actually was.  I also don't think I ultimately over-reacted.... much.", "I had a girlfriend that used to tell her kids to behave or the police would come and take them away. I told her not to do that--what if her kids got lost? Were in danger? They'd be too scared to go to a cop. She just shrugged and said it was the only way to get them to behave. We stopped being friends after that. I don't deal with willful stupidity.", "Oh my god, I hate the police comment. My husband works as an early childhood teacher and apparently that stupid shit happens so often. \nCan people please stop traumatizing their children?"]}
