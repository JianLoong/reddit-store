From then my mom has lived there and they\u2019ve been together pretty much ever since.\n\nDuring this time I have been back-and-forth between my bio dad and my mom\u2019s through out the years until my 2nd year of high school to where I\u2019ve now stayed with my dad(47m).\n\nNow mom is staying with stepdad and his mother for bit before they moved out to an apartment later. This is where his mother (issue #1) comes in, she wasn\u2019t a good person AT ALL! She lied, she stole, she was abusive, she loved attention good or bad, spreading rumors about others and instigates for no reason. My stepdad on the other hand is a mama\u2018s boy(issue #2). He would take care of her wants and needs even though she already has a fianc\u00e9 that did that for her too. As this went on throughout their relationship and marriage he would neglect things at home including my mother, especially when it came to her abuse and words. Mom has been dealing with this for 15 years on top of raising 3 girls pretty much alone since he only caters instead of parenting them and doesn\u2019t help at home regardless of if he has work or not(issue #3). At this point it\u2019s reached an extent that it\u2019s been taking a toll on her health and wellness!\n\nIt\u2019s gotten so bad that one Saturday night I got a call from my mothers phone but, it wasn\u2019t my mother. It was Auntie R telling me that she was in the hospital for a blood pressure over 200 and my stepdad no where to be found. I had to literally ask my bio dad to call him because I was livid! He tried to talk to me to call me down but, I just said \u201cit\u2019s OK\u201d because I knew my words would\u2019ve been so disrespectful.\n\nMe, my mother, my godmother and Auntie R were p!$$ed. After getting off the phone with them, my father then comes to tell me that my stepfather said he wasn\u2019t needed at the hospital.  But my thoughts were if his wife almost had a stroke so why wouldn\u2019t he need to be there at the hospital?\n\nI\u2019m still currently infuriated with this man. He made a vowed to my mother \u201cIn sickness and in health and for better or worse.\u201c Now I can\u2019t trust him with my mother and as things continue; I\u2019m growing resentful and hateful towards this man\u2026.  I am angry, I am tired, I am hatful and I am done with tolerating my mother being placed a second fiddle!\n\nSo Reddit am I the a-hole for feeling this way? \n\nI may be the a-hole since this man has been in my life for the majority of it and he could have been in a tight spot but, I feel like he could have handled things a lot better than this!", "created_utc": 1667251619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yipgjo/aita_for_wanting_my_mom_and_stepdad_to_divorce/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course his behaviour is wrong, but I think you would be TA if you try and interfere beyond offering support to your mother. Don\u2019t get in the middle of a marriage - it cannot end well.", "NTA. You are entitled to feel whatever you feel, always. In this case, your feelings also seem objectively justified. You will not be able to do anything about it, though. The fact that this man has been in your life for a long time has nothing to do with it. He has had a long time to establish himself as a bad character in your book.", "Oh honey no. You are NTA and all you want is your mama safe and sound. I\u2019m this way with mine too. I\u2019d walk through fire for that woman and everyone in my life knows that. But your step-dad sounds abusive as hell. This is so hard because your mom has to make that decision, but I totally understand you being extremely protective of her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
