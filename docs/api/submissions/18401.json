I am prepared for several hours out of the house, snack, juice, books (Don't Mess with Duck which I highly recommend) etc.. I grab the nappy bag, throw it in the pram and leave. \n\nWe go to the pub for a spot of lunch, we read a story, I drink some of my pint and then the baby poo's. No problem, I threw the nappy bag into the pram. \n\nI go through said bag and there are no nappies. \n\nIt's 21\u2070C outside, she is in a dress and I have promised the park. I am panicking. There are trousers in the bag, do I just bang them on and style it out? Do we sack off the park and go home? DonI just deal with that meltdown?\n\nLuckily the pub have nappies in the changing room and I bang her in some tight fitting neonatal nappies and we head for the park.\n\nWhen I get home, my wife gets annoyed at me for not checking the bag before leaving. My standpoint: if you use the last nappy, you should replenish the bag and the nappy bag is a grab bag. She thinks I am the a*shole for not checking, I think she is the a*shole for not replenishing the nappy supply in the bag when she uses the last one. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit several hours later: I should have checked the bag. I get it. It is my fault, thanks guys. I will apologise when she gets home from work. You guys are mad with all of the comments calling me a useless Dad.

You always gotta check that the diaper bag is stocked before you leave the house. You\u2019re the one responsible for making sure the baby has everything she needs when you\u2019re out with her. It\u2019s not at all intuitive to expect the person who is getting home with a baby in tow to remember to repack the diaper bag. Just check before you go out and don\u2019t blame your wife for your mistakes.\n\nHell, how are you even so sure it was her who used the last one?", "YTA.  Don't blame her because you didn't check the nappy bag for nappies. We all know a nappy bag with no nappies is just a bag. I agree with you that if you use the last nappy you should add nappies.  But you're the one who left with a nappyless nappybag.  YOU should've checked.  Next time, nappy up - all by yourself.  You can do it!  I believe in you!", "You grabbed your highly recommended book, but not butt wipes. Priorities my man, priorities.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

You open it , look at what you need , pack it ...... \n\nYTA even if you both normally keep it stocked like it's an emergency bug out bag , it's still your responsibility to ensure you have everything", "YTA obviously.\n\nBut for the people arguing, here is where the theory that the wife (or whoever) should replenish and the next person should just be able to grab it falls apart. How would the person replenishing the bag know how many nappies to put it in the bag for the next outing? In theory, the wife could say hey theres one left - all good. Not the last one! Then dumbass dad grabs the bag because it's too much work for him to check and he's going out for eight hours. Now it's the wife's fault there aren't FOUR nappies in there. Would you look at that? He's never responsible for it!", "\u201cI\u2019m prepared for several hours out of the house\u201d\u2026 No, no you weren\u2019t. Obviously you check for diapers.

Yes, she should have replenished it, but it\u2019s ultimately your responsibility to check the bag before leaving the house because you\u2019ll be the one ending up with a soiled baby and no diaper.", "YTA, you always refill the bag for the activity YOU have planned. You should have checked before you left. I\u2019m guessing your wife is the default parent.", "YTA, you never leave the house without checking the bag.

So, while for me it's reasonable to refill the nappies if I use the last one, it might not be for your wife, and ultimately I do think it's your mistake not checking if there were any nappies in the bag (you did pack other basic things!).\n\nBottom line, YTA for getting angry at your wife for this when really, you should've checked before going out.", "Are you fucking kidding me?

This is from someone holding 5 month old baby asleep because sometimes she only contact sleeps.", "YTA for not checking before leaving.", "YTA- check the bag before going out. EVEN IF your wife always filled them up after use, you still always double check. That\u2019s not something you take the risk with.

Why does your wife have to do everything?  Also, she may not have realised she used the last nappy last time she used the nappy bag.", "YTA, take responsibility for yourself.

You should always check it before you leave", "YTA", "How hard would it have been to check the bag before leaving. When babies go through a bunch, it can be hard to remember exactly what what used.

Your wife gets all of the emotional baggage, so you could help a little. YTA 100%", "YTA  More than likely she simply forgot.  There is no reason you cannot check the bag before you leave.  That is pretty much standard procedure when you have kids in diapers.  You obviously had to point out to her the error of her ways instead of keeping your mouth shut for such a trivial thing.

I am prepared for several hours out of the house, snack, juice, books (Don't Mess with Duck which I highly recommend) etc.. I grab the nappy bag, throw it in the pram and leave. \n\nWe go to the pub for a spot of lunch, we read a story, I drink some of my pint and then the baby poo's. No problem, I threw the nappy bag into the pram. \n\nI go through said bag and there are no nappies. \n\nIt's 21\u2070C outside, she is in a dress and I have promised the park. I am panicking. There are trousers in the bag, do I just bang them on and style it out? Do we sack off the park and go home? DonI just deal with that meltdown?\n\nLuckily the pub have nappies in the changing room and I bang her in some tight fitting neonatal nappies and we head for the park.\n\nWhen I get home, my wife gets annoyed at me for not checking the bag before leaving. My standpoint: if you use the last nappy, you should replenish the bag and the nappy bag is a grab bag. She thinks I am the a*shole for not checking, I think she is the a*shole for not replenishing the nappy supply in the bag when she uses the last one. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's as automatic to parenting as \"Go before we go.\"  \n\nOP really is blaming his wife to deflect his embarrassment for being this bad at Dadding.", "Right?! I don't know what I was expecting when I read OP'S post, but he really set himself up for failure.", "I left the house without my cars keys in my purse, naturally I blamed my partner because he was at work and couldn't remind me that I put my keys in my other purse /s", "And I guarantee you his wife would have double-checked the nappy bag.", "Exactly this. I never really refill it when I get home either. I refill everything before I go out. It just makes sense.", "I'm only the granny and I know enough to double check everything before I leave with the grandbaby. Spare bottle/dummy/ruggy/nappies/wipes and clothes if going for longer than a quick outing.", "My fist wife complained her handbag was getting heavy, even when she took everything thing out! It turns out one of the seams in the lining had split and coins were falling behind it. We pulled out about $200 in coins. This is Australian money so there plenty of one and two dollar coins in there", "Oh totally agree. When I\u2019m the only one who packs the bag I know what I\u2019m missing and can grab the extra stuff I might need. 5 diapers a kid is always enough for any day trip we take, so that only changes if we\u2019re taking an actual trip. Always throw in fresh snacks and a bottle or two for my youngest with an ice pack depending on how long we\u2019ll be out. If my husband takes the bag out, I still restock it but he also checks to make sure he has everything he needs before he leaves.", "\"Oh, THAT's where I left my bracelet!  I guess I took it off to change diapers.\"", "I have that same skill.", "Right? I used to be sure I had three when leaving the house for several hours. Odds are you won\u2019t need them\u2014but if you do, you really want to have them, and they weigh nothing.", "You don\u2019t check you have to deal with the situation so do yourself a favor and check for nappies.  If being proactive is important to you then take on the responsibility of filling the bag before bed, after every outing no matter how exhausted you are or if the kid is having a meltdown or it is time to make dinner or you need the facilities right now or it is too late for your kid to use the facilities. Fill that nappy bag now before someone might actually possibly use it without checking it, other things can wait.  Sheesh.", "I think most of us do/did. When we loaded it up with snacks and backup clothes because it doesn't make sense to leave those in the bag an unknown amount of time.", "Right, because usually you walking with children and start right in with lunch, nap, dinner\u2026that bag is my last thought.", "Exactly!!", "Gotta say that early work in EMS prepared me well for a lifetime of good tactical habits, like grabbing the first opportunity to resupply, checking then re-checking, verifying for myself *always* until partner & I had established a solid routine that I could depend on, never assuming *anything*, and developing a good sense of humor when things inevitably *still* don\u2019t go to plan. \n\nBetter safe than sorry comes to mind, as does a well prepped ambulance (or life, in most cases including this) has loads less frustration. If you develop that muscle, OP, it will only serve to enhance your parenting endurance & fun! NAH is my vote, but quit blaming your wife and take the lesson!!", "This right here. I bet OP doesn't refill the bag after coming home either, but it's a nice reason to blame the woman.", "Not just the kids either. When my son was little he dumped a hot chocolate in my lap and I had to duck into the shop and change into new jeans and explain why I was wearing them and not my old ones when I paid.", "The ONE time we went out without the diaper bag,she pooped.

My wife and I always had a bag that was meant to be a \u201cgrab and go\u201d bag. It was made for when things were hectic, or we just needed one less stress at that time. There were times where one of us, or even both of us, left with the bag and it was missing diapers. I assume nappies are just diapers, yes I\u2019m from the U.S. When I left the house thinking I had everything I needed, only to discover at a critical time that I didn\u2019t, it made me incredibly frustrated. To me, it is common courtesy, if you use the last of something then you replace it. On the other hand, however, I am responsible for my child at that point. I should have double checked the bag, but I failed to do so. This is a situation where not you and your wife are in the wrong.

Had to do a double take at the use of it here.", "Agreed. I\u2019m the diaper bag stocker and main user. (SAHM) even I re-check myself because once I thought I had a stocked bag and went to change my kid only to find a single diaper and the very real need to stop at a store or change my going out plans to be a lot shorter. Also it might not be stocked for the kind of outing you\u2019re going on. Four diapers is fine if I\u2019m going to the grocery store. I\u2019ll want at least 8 for a dinner out. Etc etc. different plans require different amounts. All that to say is if you\u2019re grabbing the bag, check it!", "Exactly. They're parents, they should both be aware of how easy it is to get distracted and forget to fix a thing or communicate it. When i use the last dog poo bag, I can insist on standing still to text the fiance a heads up in case I forget to refill the thing on the leash when I get home.\n\nBut here he is, flustered about how to not disappoint a kid promised a trip to the park - can OP not imagine a circumstance where someone might forget to either fix the issue or communicate it?\n\nAnd for that matter if you're out for the whole day the number of diapers you need is flexible depending on both your plans and how the little one has been feeling lately.

Some things, I think, should live in a diaper bag (like diapers) and be refilled when you use the last, but to blame someone else because he didn\u2019t check is rude and blasting her on the internet over it is overkill", "The problem is that he did a bang out job \"banging it out\" \ud83e\udd23\n\n\nBang: another word with different meanings depending on which side of the Pond one lives \ud83e\udd23", "Yes, and similarly, if I started on a long trip without checking the tank before passing the gas station, it would be my fault for getting on the highway without checking the tank.

Wait till he finds out babies can poop more than once a day.\n\nAnd seriously, this guy\u2019s child is *2 years old*, and he\u2019s only just *now* realizing that part of going somewhere with her involves making sure the nappy bag is stocked.

Do you think he doesn't do this simply because of his gender?", "I've also heard that people are able to buy things in places called \"stores.\" I'm not super familiar with the world, but I'm guessing he could have bought some nappies in one of these so-called stores. Maybe I'm wrong, though, because the way he describes his mental turmoil over discovering he was out of nappies makes me think this might be a myth.", "A pub in the daytime is chill and family friendly, and one beer isn't a big deal imo.", "I take a nappy or two every time I leave with the baby.
