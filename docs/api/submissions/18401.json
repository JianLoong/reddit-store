I am prepared for several hours out of the house, snack, juice, books (Don't Mess with Duck which I highly recommend) etc.. I grab the nappy bag, throw it in the pram and leave. \n\nWe go to the pub for a spot of lunch, we read a story, I drink some of my pint and then the baby poo's. No problem, I threw the nappy bag into the pram. \n\nI go through said bag and there are no nappies. \n\nIt's 21\u2070C outside, she is in a dress and I have promised the park. I am panicking. There are trousers in the bag, do I just bang them on and style it out? Do we sack off the park and go home? DonI just deal with that meltdown?\n\nLuckily the pub have nappies in the changing room and I bang her in some tight fitting neonatal nappies and we head for the park.\n\nWhen I get home, my wife gets annoyed at me for not checking the bag before leaving. My standpoint: if you use the last nappy, you should replenish the bag and the nappy bag is a grab bag. She thinks I am the a*shole for not checking, I think she is the a*shole for not replenishing the nappy supply in the bag when she uses the last one. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685309040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ubkpg/aita_for_getting_annoyed_at_my_wife_for_having_no/", "score": 828, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You always gotta check that the diaper bag is stocked before you leave the house. You\u2019re the one responsible for making sure the baby has everything she needs when you\u2019re out with her. It\u2019s not at all intuitive to expect the person who is getting home with a baby in tow to remember to repack the diaper bag. Just check before you go out and don\u2019t blame your wife for your mistakes.\n\nHell, how are you even so sure it was her who used the last one?", "YTA.  Don't blame her because you didn't check the nappy bag for nappies. We all know a nappy bag with no nappies is just a bag. I agree with you that if you use the last nappy you should add nappies.  But you're the one who left with a nappyless nappybag.  YOU should've checked.  Next time, nappy up - all by yourself.  You can do it!  I believe in you!", "You grabbed your highly recommended book, but not butt wipes. Priorities my man, priorities.\n\nYTA", "YTA. The person TAKING the baby needs to be the one to check the supply levels of the bag before leaving the house.

You open it , look at what you need , pack it ...... \n\nYTA even if you both normally keep it stocked like it's an emergency bug out bag , it's still your responsibility to ensure you have everything", "YTA obviously.\n\nBut for the people arguing, here is where the theory that the wife (or whoever) should replenish and the next person should just be able to grab it falls apart. How would the person replenishing the bag know how many nappies to put it in the bag for the next outing? In theory, the wife could say hey theres one left - all good. Not the last one! Then dumbass dad grabs the bag because it's too much work for him to check and he's going out for eight hours. Now it's the wife's fault there aren't FOUR nappies in there. Would you look at that? He's never responsible for it!", "\u201cI\u2019m prepared for several hours out of the house\u201d\u2026 No, no you weren\u2019t. Obviously you check for diapers. YTA this was your problem not your wife\u2019s.", "YTA. The one taking the bag has to check everything. Your wife does not owe you a ready bag every time you go for a walk. I bet she checks before going out, and that is her system. It is not always possible to replenish immediately after the walk, much easier to do it while planning the next walk, before going out.", "Come on. Everyone knows you need to check and pack the bag for whatever you\u2019re doing. YTA.", "Everybody has to deal with the most immediate need when they have a baby in hand. It\u2019s super easy to come home with a tired hungry baby and forget to restock the bag- your priority when you come home is never the bag restocking.\n\nWhen you leave you have to double check. \n\nI bet you never leave without double checking again. \n\nLay off your spouse.  It\u2019ll be you next time. Nobody here is really TA unless you always insist on everything being exactly the way you\u2019d like it to be- if so, YTA.", "YTA. \n\nYou always check before leaving, you\u2019re never home when you use the last one, therefor not immediately replacing.

Does she expect you to make sure it's stocked before she goes out?", "YTA. You always check the bag before you leave, it\u2019s umber one rule when you leave the house with a baby.

Don\u2019t blame your wife, she may have just forgotten. You didn\u2019t check before you left either. It\u2019s not a big deal really, so don\u2019t make it into one.

Just check the bag from now on.", "YTA and owe your wife a big apology. You're putting an additional mental load on your wife for your failure to adult.

Just get in the habit of checking the diaper bag before you leave. This is basic parenting stuff.", "INFO:  when you got home did you restock the nappy bag?", "YTA.  You should have checked it before leaving. Yes, she should have replenished it, but it\u2019s ultimately your responsibility to check the bag before leaving the house because you\u2019ll be the one ending up with a soiled baby and no diaper.", "YTA, you always refill the bag for the activity YOU have planned. You should have checked before you left. I\u2019m guessing your wife is the default parent.", "YTA, you never leave the house without checking the bag. While it should be restocked after use, it\u2019s common sense to check before leaving. Things happen and it isn\u2019t always easy to restock. Take responsibility for not ensuring that everything you need is there before leaving the house.", "I feel like this one is really tame compared to other posts but...YTA. \n\nWhile I agree it's common courtesy to refill the nappies, I get the idea that this hasn't really been talked about and there wasn't a prior agreement about it. So, while for me it's reasonable to refill the nappies if I use the last one, it might not be for your wife, and ultimately I do think it's your mistake not checking if there were any nappies in the bag (you did pack other basic things!).\n\nBottom line, YTA for getting angry at your wife for this when really, you should've checked before going out.", "Are you fucking kidding me? YTAe Man. Yes, you check it and pack it EVERY time you\u2019re going to leave the house! I guarantee she does. Grow up man", "I only forgot to check the bag one time.

That is something a well-prepared parent does before leaving the house. YTA", "Yta. The nappy bag is not a grab bag. It's the same as the other baby stuff. And should be checked. \nShould it be filled by see uses the last one? Yes, ideally. But the not having nappies is the responsibility of the person taking it and the baby out. This is from someone holding 5 month old baby asleep because sometimes she only contact sleeps.", "YTA for not checking before leaving.", "YTA- check the bag before going out. EVEN IF your wife always filled them up after use, you still always double check. That\u2019s not something you take the risk with. It\u2019s really easy to check the bag and really not fair for you to actually be upset at her because you didn\u2019t check the most important thing", "YTA. You were the one leaving the house with the kid, it was your responsibility to make sure you had everything you needed.", "Yeah I\u2019m sorry but YTA. You can ask your wife to next time check / refill it but you still have to make sure you have everything you need before you head out", "YTA- it was your responsibility to check the bag before you left the house", "YTA - you check you have what you may need before leaving the house with a baby/toddler.   Why does your wife have to do everything?  Also, she may not have realised she used the last nappy last time she used the nappy bag.", "YTA, take responsibility for yourself. She may not even have known it was the last one when she used it. You made sure you had all the other stuff you needed so why should she be blamed you forgot to check?", "YTA. You should always check it before you leave", "YTA", "How hard would it have been to check the bag before leaving. When babies go through a bunch, it can be hard to remember exactly what what used. Every trip should be a quick inventory check before leaving. You took the kid - you should have checked the bag. You\u2019re a capable adult - act like it. Your wife gets all of the emotional baggage, so you could help a little. YTA 100%", "YTA  More than likely she simply forgot.  There is no reason you cannot check the bag before you leave.  That is pretty much standard procedure when you have kids in diapers.  You obviously had to point out to her the error of her ways instead of keeping your mouth shut for such a trivial thing.  In the future do what the rest of us had to do before we left the house with such a young child.", "YTA. Checking the nappy bag is such an obvious thing to do.", "YTA. I didn\u2019t realise your wife was the one who planned to take the baby out and had to make sure the bag was packed.\n\nSounds like another instance of a man expecting the mental load to be done by his wife in regards to parenting. \nDad up, bro. You\u2019re being a shit one.", "Yta. You check the bag before you go out for everything. You were able to grab everything else you needed, why not make sure you have the essentials?", "YTA.

You are equally responsible for making sure the diaper bag is packed. You should be equally competent to do check to make sure it\u2019s packed before you leave. \n\nAsking her (without attitude) if you can come up with a system together to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again is reasonable. That might look like cleaning out the bag after every use and then restocking it, which is what I do after I use ours. But you should still always check to make sure you have an extra change of clothes or two for the baby, diapers, wipes, etc.", "YTA.

So, that's on you.", "YTA. \nNo further comment.", "YTA. I ALWAYS check the bag before using it.

I am prepared for several hours out of the house, snack, juice, books (Don't Mess with Duck which I highly recommend) etc.. I grab the nappy bag, throw it in the pram and leave. \n\nWe go to the pub for a spot of lunch, we read a story, I drink some of my pint and then the baby poo's. No problem, I threw the nappy bag into the pram. \n\nI go through said bag and there are no nappies. \n\nIt's 21\u2070C outside, she is in a dress and I have promised the park. I am panicking. There are trousers in the bag, do I just bang them on and style it out? Do we sack off the park and go home? DonI just deal with that meltdown?\n\nLuckily the pub have nappies in the changing room and I bang her in some tight fitting neonatal nappies and we head for the park.\n\nWhen I get home, my wife gets annoyed at me for not checking the bag before leaving. My standpoint: if you use the last nappy, you should replenish the bag and the nappy bag is a grab bag. She thinks I am the a*shole for not checking, I think she is the a*shole for not replenishing the nappy supply in the bag when she uses the last one. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Idk why OP panicked and didn't just go buy some more instead.", "I think we would need more info before deciding that. Was this mistake made because OP rarely takes the kid out and about, or because OP does it frequently and assumed wife had followed the refill-protocol as usual and therefore didn\u2019t think to check?

So yes, we check for cash before we go if we think we might need it, just like we check diapers. Perfect analogy!", "That\u2019s not how diaper bags work.

Mothers can do wrong sometimes people", "Not the grass. The horror.", "This is my experience. \n\nBack in the day when I had kids in diapers- I would empty the bag out when I got home- snacks, cups, any favorite toys, it all needed to come out. I usually would just grab a couple diapers and an open pack of wipes when I was getting ready to leave. \n\nEvery outing is different- pool? Sunscreen and pool diapers. Park? Bug spray and snacks. Restaurant? Change of clothes and extra distracting toys. \n\nIt didn't make sense in my diaper bag experience to just have a fully loaded bag there all the time.", "Yea OP\u2019s system is bound to fail. He could have left with just one diaper for a 6 hour excursion under his theory, and still been short a diaper if the baby had 2 dirty diapers during that time. Best to check before you head out and get what you need for that outing.", "Agreed. The next person to use it might need one just in case, or they might be out all day and need to load the bag up. \n\nPlus there\u2019s other stuff people usually put in the diaper bag that\u2019s situation dependent. If I\u2019m running out for 30 minutes I\u2019m not going to haul around a full container of wipes, a couple of extra outfits, food/snacks, multiple toys etc. You pack the bag based on what you actually need, not what the last person to use the bag thought you might need.", "On reflection I think you're right.

I always keep 5 diapers and a change of clothes for each kid by default. Then depending on weather I might pack extra stuff like a blanket or sun hats. When I inevitably run late for appointments, I never have to worry I won\u2019t have diapers.", "I disagree - in the sense that I treated the diaper bag as an emergency go bag for baby, so I kept it fully stocked, ready to grab by the door as I ran for my life with the baby under one arm or something.\n\nBut I agree that checking that you are leaving with all the necessities is utterly the job of the custodial parent in the moment - it's a lot of emotional and psychological labor he feels entitled to.", "You need to update the skills section of your CV", "Also very extremely easily distracted by the small taskmaster with constand needs.", "Absolutely.
