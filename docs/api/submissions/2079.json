As someone who has birthed three out of four of my hobbits, I feel you. Especially with my first, I suddenly felt like certain things around the house just weren't right, and desperately wanted to change them. Including redecorating four rooms of our house. My other half, like yours, kept saying he'll do it later. Later came when I gave up and started doing it myself.\n\nMy Mother turned up, took the paint brush off me and her and other half finished it all up \ud83d\ude48.\n\nPoint is, to me, this was really important. To him, he was going to work, doing usual household stuff, and stressing about bringing a child into the world and providing for all of us as a family. The little down time he did have was usually sleeping or finding me obscure snacks.\n\nTo him, the place really didn't need decorating and he didn't put it in the same place on his priority list as I did mine. Not because he didn't care, but because perception is reality.\n\nTo him, redecorating didn't help us, and was a waste of precious time. It was never about him not caring or not being arsed.\n\nBut to *me*, it was important and I felt like he didn't care about me or what was about to be our family home. \n\nMy point is, wires get crossed SO easily when expecting a potato with limbs, and even more in those first six months. Trust me, I wanted to slaughter my husband when our now four year old was born just for breathing wrong.\n\nBe kind to yourself and each other. I would show him this thread if it helps, or if needed sit down and say it was really important to me, but I realise it wasn't for you. My intention wasn't to make you look bad, I was feeling frustrated and that poured over. If I tell you when something is a big deal to me next time, can you go on to help me with it as best you can?\n\n\nGood luck with everything, it's going to be great, take the epidural if you want it, it won't harm the baby. If you can't breast feed, don't struggle and make yourself miserable, formula (unless we're talking Nestle) has never made a baby grow two heads yet. Take advice with a pinch of salt and ignore anyone make you feel guilty. Mum's with several kids will probably have the best advi d for keeping your sanity. If that involves cake for breakfast and a litre of coffee, that's OK. \n\nA happy Mum makes a happy baby, your suffering will not make your baby smarter, happier or healthier.\nA happy Mum usually makes a happy Dad/other Mum, too!\n\nYou've got this, all the love in the world lovely x", "how long did you wait before doing it yourself?", "NTA.

It was only urgent to YOU. If you were tired of waiting and wanted to do it yourself, that's fine, but going around and telling his parents its because he refused to help you was an AH move.

Her and papa raised me to be just a little too independent lol \n\nThe only worry I\u2019d have is the ladder because of balance. My balance was off starting in my second or third trimester but my hubby was usually good at helping when my nesting kicked in.

Your husband was working- something essential to keep the money coming in to provide for his family, including your upcoming baby. You just wanted to rearrange things, which I assume were not a problem beforehand (if it ain't broke, why fix it sort of stuff).

It also required both yours and your husband's consent as you both share the home together.\nTelling his parents he refused to help, when in fact he was providing for you and your family, because you are impatient... is an AH move.", "NTA - two weeks is plenty of time for him to help you get the books down. It wouldn't have taken that long. You could have done the organizing after he help get you started and then just did the top shelves.

I was cleaning closets and cupboards etc.", "Slight YTA. Solely because of how you put it as he wouldn't help you. His answer was that he was busy but would try to make time. To be fair, I don't even have kids or a kid coming any time in the future, and it takes me a while to even find a free moment to clean my kitchen.\n\nYou are currently nesting - hence the obsessive urge to clean. However, this is not an emergency scenario and you are also pregnant, and climbing up on ladders is not safe for anyone pregnant.\n\nTake it easy, and try to find something a little more ground level to work out that need to clean and organize right now - like the baby's room!

Presumably she had to use a step or ladder or something to reach the higher books (what everyone else's concern about it wouldn't make sense).", "NTA. My husband will say later until I either really get on him or just do it myself. The nesting urge is fierce and you showed patience by waiting a few weeks. Did it need done? Logically no.

While it can be weaker for some, it can be maddeningly strong and irritating for others to not have their space 'just so'.  When some people think of pregnancy not being an excuse, they think of things like emotional outbursts or cravings, which can certainly be mitigated. Nesting when mot indulged is something that can cause stress and anxiety over time, in this a period of two weeks, which is incredibly bad for the baby. \n\nMaybe you could have said your husband said he would do it but kept putting it off to his parents, but he likely would have gotten scolded anyway. Besides, he definitely could have reorganized things with you at some point in those two weeks.\n\nUltimately, he is in fact an asshole.", "YTA you need to choose your words more wisely.", "YTA your husband was busy and you decided to do a dangerous and strenuous task even though your pregnant .

And a high risk pregnancy as well. I never used it as a reason to do out of character things or excuse bad/selfish behavior. Nor did I expect anyone else to think the above simply because of it.

Biological need my arse. So pregnant women feel the need to nest? Absolutely. Do they have to give in to it to the detriment of everything else? Errrrrr no. \n\nIf she wanted to do this alone because hubby was busy, then rock on, but don\u2019t make him look bad because you\u2019re irrationally rearranging your library, which doesn\u2019t benefit the baby or your husband in any way. It\u2019s not like you were setting up the nursery or something", "she's not a bird, her kid will probably be safe without the reorganized library.", "That's how I feel about this also. OP didn't get upset husband didn't get out of his chair the second she mentioned it... she waited a beyond reasonable amount of time, decided he wasn't ever going to do it, and just did it herself rather than begging or nagging. I don't understand all the Y T A votes. If he wanted to do this for his wife, he could've made time to do it during that time span. NTA OP", ">PSA: Antibiotics invalidate the pill.\n\nI'm loving your PSA!   \n\n\nMy regular DR was off sick, so I had a new student DR - she seemed nice, gave me some antibiotics and my re-filled my pill. Phoned me 4 days later to inform me that the pill won't work on antibiotics.   \n\n\n15yrs later I have a very grumpy teenager. Thanks Doc.", "No it wasn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter how strong her urge to \u201cnest\u201d is, she threw him under the bus because she wanted to reorganize some books? Those books could have waited. If it was important, maybe. But books? No.", "> The library is the only thing I asked him to help me with.\n\nYeah I don't believe that at all. If OP's nesting is this overpowering he's probably having to do a lot more because she's too busy with \"important\" things like making sure there's no cobwebs in the guest bedroom.", "Sounds like mansplaining to me. Have you ever \u201cnested\u201d? I have and it drives you crazy until you act on it. It\u2019s like a craving.", "Perhaps it is, but that\u2019s of no import in this conversation. It\u2019s understandable for him to not focus a lot of attention on it if he has a lot on his mind, but if he has an extra half hour once in a while, he could do something for her peace of mind. As people have stated, she\u2019s not incapable. After weeks of him putting it off, she decided to do it herself. It\u2019s not her fault that his parents have an outdated idea of pregnancy and think that she shouldn\u2019t be doing physical things. It\u2019s also not his fault. But if they come at her asking about it, there\u2019s no reason to act like she hasn\u2019t asked him to do it. If his parents get cranky at him for not helping out, that\u2019s not her fault. It\u2019s not his either, but he can deal with their bullshit because they\u2019re his parents", "Yup. I was putting up Halloween decorations 6 hours before my water broke. My husband made me wait until October 1, I went into labour Oct 2.", "Nesting does not feel like \u201creorganize or your baby will die.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s more of the internal sense that there will not be time to do any of these home tasks once the baby arrives, so get it done NOW or it will be a VERY long time before you can accomplish this.", "[op\u2019s comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysr5dm/aita_for_reorganising_my_library_while_pregnant/iw0hwl4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)", "You must\u2019ve not had really bad compulsions then, your experience is not everyone\u2019s experience", "Just because you went throught one thing doesn\u2019t mean that everyone had the same experience as you.

I tried to redirect the energy but the craving was strong. I couldn\u2019t work or sit still I just kept thinking of them. I couldn\u2019t sleep. Then one day at 3am I woke up crying hysterically for them. No where was open. The next day I ate 3 boxes worth and would eat a box a day until the craving settled. It\u2019s not easy to say just redirect it. Hormones are crazy.", ">he is not required to indulge in pregnancy hormones\n\nHe did help get her pregnant correct? She has to put up with a pregnancy for nine months and all he has to do is help out his wife a little bit.", ">Like I said 30 mins top to help.\n\nPlease show me this magical household where rearranging a room takes 30 minutes and that moving the heavy books is the only thing he'd be asked to do once it got started.", "I didn\u2019t either. Had figured because he was born at 37 weeks so it didn\u2019t have time to kick in but reading about when other people had the instinct has shown that to be wrong.

It usually doesn't make sense, but your brain just won't let it go", "I remember being 8 months pregnant and rearranging my entire bedroom by myself. 14 years later i still don't know why but it seemed 100% vital at the time. Pregnancy does crazy things to the body and I don't think men realize that. They only see the outside changes of growing bigger or being more tired. While pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancies aren't total invalids their body is still going insane. Hence weird cravings and randomly crying and yes, nesting syndrome.", "All she asked him to do was help with the top shelf, that would take thirty minutes", "I was on bed rest with my first and got a bit nesty but she was born at 35 weeks so didn\u2019t have full blown nesting", "They dont tell you 3 am feedings start way before baby arrives.", "I reupholstered and painted a chair when I was 41wks  with my first, and I cleaned EVERYTHING in the apartment including throwing out our fake Xmas tree because it didn\u2019t fit where I wanted it. I was full bananapants and felt so out of control.", "For me it was baby hats. I had a massive collection of handmade newborn baby hats. The family still jokes about my obsession with the hats 11 years later. Then he had a massive head and never wore any of them.", "My sister scrubbed her bathroom while actively in labor, apparently it took a while to get her into the car to go to the hospital because leaving the bathroom half-scrubbed was just that distressing. Nearing is weird.", "Mine was at least semi useful -i became obsessed with hoovering. All furniture had to be moved so we could hoover behind /under it all. The stairs have also never looked cleaner.", "It's like having a manic episode. I remember bolting awake one night with the urgent need to fold all of the blankets in the house perfectly.
