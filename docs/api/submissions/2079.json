As someone who has birthed three out of four of my hobbits, I feel you. Especially with my first, I suddenly felt like certain things around the house just weren't right, and desperately wanted to change them. Including redecorating four rooms of our house. My other half, like yours, kept saying he'll do it later. Later came when I gave up and started doing it myself.\n\nMy Mother turned up, took the paint brush off me and her and other half finished it all up \ud83d\ude48.\n\nPoint is, to me, this was really important. To him, he was going to work, doing usual household stuff, and stressing about bringing a child into the world and providing for all of us as a family. The little down time he did have was usually sleeping or finding me obscure snacks.\n\nTo him, the place really didn't need decorating and he didn't put it in the same place on his priority list as I did mine. Not because he didn't care, but because perception is reality.\n\nTo him, redecorating didn't help us, and was a waste of precious time. It was never about him not caring or not being arsed.\n\nBut to *me*, it was important and I felt like he didn't care about me or what was about to be our family home. \n\nMy point is, wires get crossed SO easily when expecting a potato with limbs, and even more in those first six months. Trust me, I wanted to slaughter my husband when our now four year old was born just for breathing wrong.\n\nBe kind to yourself and each other. I would show him this thread if it helps, or if needed sit down and say it was really important to me, but I realise it wasn't for you. My intention wasn't to make you look bad, I was feeling frustrated and that poured over. If I tell you when something is a big deal to me next time, can you go on to help me with it as best you can?\n\n\nGood luck with everything, it's going to be great, take the epidural if you want it, it won't harm the baby. If you can't breast feed, don't struggle and make yourself miserable, formula (unless we're talking Nestle) has never made a baby grow two heads yet. Take advice with a pinch of salt and ignore anyone make you feel guilty. Mum's with several kids will probably have the best advi d for keeping your sanity. If that involves cake for breakfast and a litre of coffee, that's OK. \n\nA happy Mum makes a happy baby, your suffering will not make your baby smarter, happier or healthier.\nA happy Mum usually makes a happy Dad/other Mum, too!\n\nYou've got this, all the love in the world lovely x", "how long did you wait before doing it yourself?", "NTA.

It was only urgent to YOU. If you were tired of waiting and wanted to do it yourself, that's fine, but going around and telling his parents its because he refused to help you was an AH move.

Her and papa raised me to be just a little too independent lol \n\nThe only worry I\u2019d have is the ladder because of balance. My balance was off starting in my second or third trimester but my hubby was usually good at helping when my nesting kicked in.

Your husband was working- something essential to keep the money coming in to provide for his family, including your upcoming baby. You just wanted to rearrange things, which I assume were not a problem beforehand (if it ain't broke, why fix it sort of stuff).

It also required both yours and your husband's consent as you both share the home together.\nTelling his parents he refused to help, when in fact he was providing for you and your family, because you are impatient... is an AH move.", "NTA - two weeks is plenty of time for him to help you get the books down. It wouldn't have taken that long. You could have done the organizing after he help get you started and then just did the top shelves.

I was cleaning closets and cupboards etc.", "Slight YTA. Solely because of how you put it as he wouldn't help you. His answer was that he was busy but would try to make time. To be fair, I don't even have kids or a kid coming any time in the future, and it takes me a while to even find a free moment to clean my kitchen.\n\nYou are currently nesting - hence the obsessive urge to clean. However, this is not an emergency scenario and you are also pregnant, and climbing up on ladders is not safe for anyone pregnant.\n\nTake it easy, and try to find something a little more ground level to work out that need to clean and organize right now - like the baby's room!

Presumably she had to use a step or ladder or something to reach the higher books (what everyone else's concern about it wouldn't make sense).", "NTA. My husband will say later until I either really get on him or just do it myself. The nesting urge is fierce and you showed patience by waiting a few weeks. Did it need done? Logically no.

While it can be weaker for some, it can be maddeningly strong and irritating for others to not have their space 'just so'.  When some people think of pregnancy not being an excuse, they think of things like emotional outbursts or cravings, which can certainly be mitigated. Nesting when mot indulged is something that can cause stress and anxiety over time, in this a period of two weeks, which is incredibly bad for the baby. \n\nMaybe you could have said your husband said he would do it but kept putting it off to his parents, but he likely would have gotten scolded anyway. Besides, he definitely could have reorganized things with you at some point in those two weeks.\n\nUltimately, he is in fact an asshole.", "YTA you need to choose your words more wisely.", "YTA your husband was busy and you decided to do a dangerous and strenuous task even though your pregnant .

Nesting with twins doesn't occur though as you're too big and tired too early.", "She didn't really lie tho. She asked him for help. It was two weeks later and he hadn't put any effort into helping her.", "It\u2019s just a ridiculous compulsion to organise and clean. Most of it can be directed to prepping the nursery or setting up the house for the baby but once that\u2019s done the urge doesn\u2019t magically go away. I pulled apart my (clean) rangehood and scrubbed it and put it back together and deep cleaned my pantry. To my knowledge my six month old is yet to use my kitchen so they were pretty pointless tasks but if I didn\u2019t do it on THAT DAY then the world was going to end.", "It's not about the library per se. Nesting is about preparing the home and completing unfinished projects before the baby shows up. To OP, the library was the unfinished project that was going to be completed, come hell or high water.", "Cravings are your body saying they need something specific in the food you're dying to eat. I HATE pickles. HATE them. Never eat them. During the first trimester I acquired and ate two jars full of those awful things. It's real and it's biological. We must ensure our child's environment is ready for their arrival. It's a driving need, in some. Maybe others don't experience this because their evolutionary trajectory has eliminated the compulsion.", "You\u2019re saying there is definitively a logical order to what is essentially an illogical compulsion? Maybe rethink that.", "No but idk to take 15-20 minute breaks to help your wife doesn\u2019t seem extreme to me. Plus maybe it\u2019s something they can bond over. That\u2019s how I see it how are they going to coparent if taking that small amount of time with her asking for help is to much?", "Missed my whole fuckin point you were lifting a 3 year old. Why because being a mom doesn't stop. I just reorganized my own library . The top shelf I had to extend  fully out and lift decently heavy books outside of my power zone . The whole point of this strain being bad is you can just pull a muscle pretty easy or fall if she's too short and has to use a step ladder. Chances are she won't but this was not necessary . Your 3 year old necessary . Book rearrange because I'm too impatient to wait on my husband then complain about it to his family ....that no good", "How is that so hard to comprehend?", "Hahhaha. Yeah, okay.", "Yeah, he's NOT required to do it, but he can't get  mad when people ask why he's not helping. She was minding her own business and getting on with it when his parents walked in.", "Try to get that person in trouble?? She was asked a question and answered. If her husband didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed for not helping his pregnant wife after promising to do so TWO WEEKS AGO, then he should\u2019ve helped his wife like he promised.\n\nNTA", "They asked, all she did was answer. He didn\u2019t help, I don\u2019t understand what the big issue is. She asked for help- waited to weeks- did the thing herself- was questioned about the thing and said \u201cno I\u2019m just doing it myself I didn\u2019t get help from him\u201d, nothing more to it. He could have found at least 30 minutes in 2 weeks. And if she\u2019s late in the pregnancy waiting to long might turn into it never getting done because the baby was born", "This person is one of the *I had it like this that means everyone else have it the same*\n\nMy sister almost ripped her whole house apart when nesting.. she changed every tiny piece of the house.. and then dyed outside walls \ud83d\ude43\n\nI on the other hand never did, or so I thought, till I realised I had 30 baby towels... and baby spoons... a lof of baby spoons", "Oh yes! Two days before my first was born I was labeling everything in my spiceshelf. Cause you know, what if I needed to look at them from above and see what they are? Lables on top! \nInsane but it was like scratching an itch, sooo good.", "I re-upholstered the dining room chair at around 8 months. I could barely reach the staple gun across my huge belly.  But I would NOT give up. Those chairs had to be done or else! Hormones are wild.", "I cooked obsessively. And made my husband move the fridge. And I did a lot of laundry. Both tasks are things I do not enjoy but I had fun while pregnant. Except I would only get nesting urges to cook mountains of food at like 12-4 am. My husband gained a lot of weight while I was pregnant.", "Nesting. Grrr.  That\u2019s how I broke my water. I moved a file cabinet by myself. I ended up having an emergency c-section. It is a compulsion.", "For me it was painting the baby\u2019s room. \n\nUnderwater theme, 3 different shades of blue with cartoon fish, dolphin and octopus. \n\nDid I mention that I have no artistic ability at all? Found images for the critters, drew them in chalk and revised until I was happy, finally painted them in.", "I have a photo that has four boxes of cleaning supplies that I ordered because only a few scents didn't make me absolutely want to vomit.", "Omg I\u2019m tired of people acting like pregnant women are crazy. I\u2019m 9 months pregnant and am not losing my mind. If she has such a strong nesting compulsion that she\u2019s putting herself in danger then she needs urgent psych help.", "Oh man. Yes. I wouldn't have gotten how bad it is unless I'd been through it. I hate cleaning to my very core, but when I was nesting I was on the floor scrubbing it by hand and organizing everything until it was just right. It was insane. I kinda miss how clean my room was then though lol", "This doesn\u2019t sound like a 15 min endeavor. Add in pregnant obsessive wife and I cannot say that I blame him for not indulging her. He should have just told her no he wouldn\u2019t help rearrange the bookshelves, and if she wanted to without him she should do what she could safely reach and carry. I totally get that nesting is a thing and it is kind of crazy, but it\u2019s not something that has to be indulged like some ppl in this thread seem to think.", "There is a huge difference between \"I asked my husband to help me and he said he would when he had time but I got impatient and did the task while my husband is busy\" and \"I asked for help for this task and my awful husband refused to help so I had to do the whole task by myself, isn't that awful?\"", "I remember remodeling a room while nesting. Tore up all of the carpet and threw it and a regular sized couch in a dumpster single handed! Crazy times.", "My nesting came in the form of emergency bags. Not just a small one either, I had a whole disaster movie running in my head and tried to plan accordingly. Each car had one, and I had a bigger one with tents, stoves, sleeping bags, a few changes of clothes, freeze dried meals as well as emergency ration bars, medical kit with sutures, and everything needed for a baby. Same thing happened with my second one so I redid all the bags. It wasn\u2019t even an anxiety thing where I was worried about a disaster happening, I just wanted make sure I was prepared for the baby just in case we ever needed it.", "When I was about 22-23 weeks pregnant I HAD to set up my entire nursery for my first. Like, assemble the crib, the mobile, set up the changing station, I even put a sheet on the mattress in the crib.\n\nAnyways my son was born at 25 weeks\ud83d\ude05 obviously he still didnt use his nursery for a long time but while he was in NICU there was something comforting about looking at all his stuff set up, and since it was set up I didnt have to try and stress about it while recovering from my csection. And one of the things about NICU is they dont generally give you a heads up on when baby can go home. With my son they gave us a weeks notice, and with my daughter (she was born at 25 weeks), they just said one day btw if she can pass her carseat test she can go home today", "My nesting urge made me paint the bathroom when I was 32 weeks along. It needed to be done THAT DAY.", "I found myself on a stepladder, scrubbing places that had never been cleaned before and have definitely not been cleaned since...24 years ago.\n\nOur bodies and minds know that *this is it*.  You won't sleep another full night for a year, likewise eat a hot meal. Just taking a 5 minute crap feels like a luxury.   If things are undone before D Day, they remain undone. Possibly forever.\n\nPretty certain anyone calling OP TAH is either unmarried or child-free. We who have succumbed to the Nesting madness understand the obsession.", "Even just getting my period I\u2019d have a manic urge to clean.", "Nesting:\n\nYOU WILL COMPLETELY REDO THE GUEST ROOM WITH NEW PAINT, NEW FURNITURE AND NEW BEDDING. \n\nRIGHT NOW.\n\nWhich would have made SLIGHT sense if we were turning it INTO the baby's room, but NO. It was still the guest room.\n\nI was bat sh!t cray cray.", "I'm so sorry! Did everyone come out of the experience healthy?", "Or, and hear me out, your experience is not the only experience, and if you read the dozens of similar replies, you'll find it's actually wrote common and does not in fact require \"urgent psych help\" what the actual fuck", "She never said it was dangerous. She said they thought it was dangerous. I rode a bike while 8 months pregnant meanwhile my friend\u2019s husband and father wouldn\u2019t let her walk down around the block because it was winter and they thought it was dangerous. Everyone has different risk tolerances and a lot of people project that things are most dangerous than the are.", "Nesting severity, much like anxiety disorder, is different for every person, and on top of that, is different for every pregnancy. I had normal nesting for my son. With my daughter I had perinatal (postnatal too) anxiety. Good. God. The. Nesting.", "i was going to ask if this nesting compulsion entitles pregnant women to be rude.. i've seen more chill pregnant people than these types. or maybe i just have chill friends overall", "Two weeks is impatient? After two weeks I assume it\u2019s just not happening", "You can be on my team when the zombies come.", "That used to drive me nutz! Regular house cleaning is nesting. Buying normal amounts of baby supplies you need is nesting. Eating is now only done for the baby. Apparently I wouldn't be cleaning, grocery/regular shopping, and eating if I wasn't pregnant. \ud83d\ude44\n\nThe second and last pregnancy, we had just moved to a radically different location and bought a big house. I was 10 weeks when we moved in. A couple months later we got our stuff from the moving company (international move) and had a massive amount of boxes. My husband works full time and I am a SAHM (3 year waitlist for daycare where we are and I would need 2 jobs for us to be able to afford and make it worth it) of a now 3 year old. This was last year. Every box I unpacked was nesting, not moving into a new house. I was just baffled by people.", "Or at least know someone who has.\n\nMine is now 16mo and just today I sobbed to my husband that it's not fair I can't pee without announcing it, inviting my kid, and then narrating the process. There is no just get up and go pee any more. The minute I leave the room I've clearly ceased to exist and screams of grief follow me.... yes.  Somewhere deep down we know. Now or never,  dust.", "Wow, it really got you good. XD I'll take bottle ever mulching any day.", "Even when not pregnant I hate this. And I feel like a total brat. Like, I received a beautiful stand mixer as a gift once. A stand mixer was a wish list item, but I asked for a small baseline model. Out of generosity the gifter researched and gifted me a larger, objectively nicer model.\n\n**I cannot lift the larger, objectively nicer model.**\n\nI ask for what I ask for on purpose, guys. I measured the space. I matched the color. I checked the specs. I don't want to he an ass here but if I was specific there's a reason....\n\nAnd yes this has come up often. I'm a size small in *some* brands and styles. If you buy other brands and styles it's not gonna fit. I'm not asking for the expensive coat to be a brat I'm telling you what fits.....", "FIRST TIME MOM! That threw me for quite some time! Not that trans people can't get pregnant but that becoming a man immediately cause it!", "I have recently realized this is A Thing and felt significantly less insane upon doing so!", "Yep. Offspring did have issues as a baby but now as a teenager you would never know.", "I don't think it entitles folk to be rude but I also don't think it was rude if the OOP to reorganize the books herself. She asked, he was busy, she did it herself. Her inlaws got upset, she told them why she was doing it herself. And the folk on here talking about building couches at 4am and cooking mountains of food and mulching their lawns - most of those things are baffling, but not rude.\n\nNo. I think hormones can be a *reason* people are rude - as in, if you want an explanation as to why this previously nice person is now a lunaric meanie, it's hormones - but thats not a free pass to be rude and get away with it.", "Because, maybe, reorganizing a library on a whim is pretty far down the priority list for an expectant father?", "100% nesting brain. ADHD brain too. Hyper focused lol like nope, not today Satan. I got bottles covered. See, I CAN focus! But only on the bottles. Don\u2019t worry, reality has a way of kicking my butt.", "Lol, feel free to come along. You will need to bring your own change of clothes and a machete, everything thing else will be provided for you ;)", "Heh I was 9 months pregnant in our new house unpacking and organizing as normal, as one does. \n\nBUT building our giant ikea futon couch by myself at 4am and my then-hubby waking up for work and finding my chonky body wrapped inside the couch as I build build build... yeah that was nesting. \n\nPeople don't know until they know and a lot of people who comment on this sub just won't know.", "I'm glad!", "To her it was very important, she waited two weeks and then did it herself. She\u2019s also expecting - and is doing the majority of the hard labor in the whole \u201cexpecting\u201d department I would say, as she\u2019s expecting to go through a labor and birth. She\u2019s nesting, she waited two weeks- after such time it\u2019s pretty reasonable to conclude it\u2019s not getting done unless she just does it. So she did"]}
