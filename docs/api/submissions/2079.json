As someone who has birthed three out of four of my hobbits, I feel you. Especially with my first, I suddenly felt like certain things around the house just weren't right, and desperately wanted to change them. Including redecorating four rooms of our house. My other half, like yours, kept saying he'll do it later. Later came when I gave up and started doing it myself.\n\nMy Mother turned up, took the paint brush off me and her and other half finished it all up \ud83d\ude48.\n\nPoint is, to me, this was really important. To him, he was going to work, doing usual household stuff, and stressing about bringing a child into the world and providing for all of us as a family. The little down time he did have was usually sleeping or finding me obscure snacks.\n\nTo him, the place really didn't need decorating and he didn't put it in the same place on his priority list as I did mine. Not because he didn't care, but because perception is reality.\n\nTo him, redecorating didn't help us, and was a waste of precious time. It was never about him not caring or not being arsed.\n\nBut to *me*, it was important and I felt like he didn't care about me or what was about to be our family home. \n\nMy point is, wires get crossed SO easily when expecting a potato with limbs, and even more in those first six months. Trust me, I wanted to slaughter my husband when our now four year old was born just for breathing wrong.\n\nBe kind to yourself and each other. I would show him this thread if it helps, or if needed sit down and say it was really important to me, but I realise it wasn't for you. My intention wasn't to make you look bad, I was feeling frustrated and that poured over. If I tell you when something is a big deal to me next time, can you go on to help me with it as best you can?\n\n\nGood luck with everything, it's going to be great, take the epidural if you want it, it won't harm the baby. If you can't breast feed, don't struggle and make yourself miserable, formula (unless we're talking Nestle) has never made a baby grow two heads yet. Take advice with a pinch of salt and ignore anyone make you feel guilty. Mum's with several kids will probably have the best advi d for keeping your sanity. If that involves cake for breakfast and a litre of coffee, that's OK. \n\nA happy Mum makes a happy baby, your suffering will not make your baby smarter, happier or healthier.\nA happy Mum usually makes a happy Dad/other Mum, too!\n\nYou've got this, all the love in the world lovely x", "how long did you wait before doing it yourself?", "NTA.

It was only urgent to YOU. If you were tired of waiting and wanted to do it yourself, that's fine, but going around and telling his parents its because he refused to help you was an AH move.

Her and papa raised me to be just a little too independent lol \n\nThe only worry I\u2019d have is the ladder because of balance. My balance was off starting in my second or third trimester but my hubby was usually good at helping when my nesting kicked in.

You need to apologize.", "NTA", "Eh - your husband isn't responsible for your obsessions.  Organizing the library wasn't urgent - it was something YOU wanted to do.  Which is fine, but it clearly didn't seem urgent or important to your husband.  This wasn't cleaning the kitchen or some other necessary task.\n\nAnd to narc to his parents?  Super petty.

Your husband was working- something essential to keep the money coming in to provide for his family, including your upcoming baby. You just wanted to rearrange things, which I assume were not a problem beforehand (if it ain't broke, why fix it sort of stuff). Yes, you had an urge to rearrange things... but this wasn't an urgent need to be fulfilled. It also required both yours and your husband's consent as you both share the home together.\nTelling his parents he refused to help, when in fact he was providing for you and your family, because you are impatient... is an AH move.", "NTA - two weeks is plenty of time for him to help you get the books down. It wouldn't have taken that long. You could have done the organizing after he help get you started and then just did the top shelves.

I was cleaning closets and cupboards etc.", "Slight YTA. Solely because of how you put it as he wouldn't help you. His answer was that he was busy but would try to make time. To be fair, I don't even have kids or a kid coming any time in the future, and it takes me a while to even find a free moment to clean my kitchen.\n\nYou are currently nesting - hence the obsessive urge to clean. However, this is not an emergency scenario and you are also pregnant, and climbing up on ladders is not safe for anyone pregnant.\n\nTake it easy, and try to find something a little more ground level to work out that need to clean and organize right now - like the baby's room!

Presumably she had to use a step or ladder or something to reach the higher books (what everyone else's concern about it wouldn't make sense).", "NTA. My husband will say later until I either really get on him or just do it myself. The nesting urge is fierce and you showed patience by waiting a few weeks. Did it need done? Logically no.

While it can be weaker for some, it can be maddeningly strong and irritating for others to not have their space 'just so'.  When some people think of pregnancy not being an excuse, they think of things like emotional outbursts or cravings, which can certainly be mitigated. Nesting when mot indulged is something that can cause stress and anxiety over time, in this a period of two weeks, which is incredibly bad for the baby. \n\nMaybe you could have said your husband said he would do it but kept putting it off to his parents, but he likely would have gotten scolded anyway. Besides, he definitely could have reorganized things with you at some point in those two weeks.\n\nUltimately, he is in fact an asshole.", "YTA you need to choose your words more wisely.", "YTA your husband was busy and you decided to do a dangerous and strenuous task even though your pregnant .

It's ok to not make your spouse's non-urgent request a priority if you're truly busy (or even need some downtime) as long as you're overall pulling your weight around the house and generally giving attention to their needs (and being even more attentive than usual for a pregnant wife).

I think the other reason people freak out about pregnant women doing stuff like this is that even if it's not all that dangerous, the consequences of a mishap could be especially dire. \n\nThat would have been a fine thing for her to say, but it's hard to think of the most diplomatic phrasing when you're being scolded and accused of endangering your child. I can see why she would feel the need to defend herself and why she would particularly want to point out that her husband, \\*who was one of the people freaking out at her,\\* could have prevented this whole situation by helping when asked.", "She should have told the parents, \"It's a long story...\" which is not a lie. She shouldn't rat out the husband. She could talk to him afterwards and tell him she is hurt and angry, but keep it between them.", "Thank you for having common sense", "She specifically said he told her he was busy. She never said that he was. She waited fucking weeks. She never mentions anything about lying around. She also never mentions him doing any chores. Stop making shit up.", "Now consider standing and waiting for another person to make their mind up on the arrangement.", "Pregnancy was hands down the worst experience of my life. So much so that my husband got snipped a month after our son was born, so I would never have to go through it again. Besides being sick the entire time, my whole body hurt, I had gestational diabetes so I had to prick my fingers 5x day for 24 WEEKS, I cried uncontrollably for absolutely no reason, I pissed myself when I coughed or sneezed, I couldn't eat the foods I liked, I had little control over my own brain. Pregnancy is fucking wild and shouldn't be taken lightly.", "Depending on how heavily pregnant she is, it *is* dangerous because your center of gravity shifts so dramatically during pregnancy. \n\nUnbalanced + a heavier weight + grabbing heavy things from up high = a good recipe for a dangerous fall while pregnant.\n\nHer husband had *ample* time to help her and chose to dismiss her instead until she couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and did it herself.\n\nOP is not an asshole, her husband is.", ">She never said that he was\n\nShe said in a reply that he was actually busy.\n\n>She also never mentions him doing any chores\n\nHence I said probably. If he's a busy person then he's got shit to do. Like work and chores", "I never want to be pregnant but if you could bottle and sell nesting hormones I could sure use some! I am a disastrous cleaner and take ages to get anything done.", "So either wait, because you know your husband is a working adult, goes to work and has his chores, or do it yourself when you want to and don't complain. It's a risk you take with wanting to do things with people. They don't necessarily have time when you do. And he clearly doesn't have time. He works, when she doesn't.", "I don't know how busy the husband is. The fact is, a multi hour project is going to displace something else in your life. Choosing to do that project instead of whatever else you were planning to do means you're prioritizing the project, even if it doesn't mean you're making it priority one. Whether he's an asshole or not depends partially on what else he had going on that would have been displaced by this unnecessary project (it's simply not necessary, no matter how strongly his wife feels the urge, to reorganize the library for a baby who won't be able to read when it comes out). Maybe he's been working, cooking, sleeping, doing other things to get ready for the baby. Maybe he's been drinking beer and watching reruns of 90s sitcoms. We just don't know. There's also the possibility that the husband didn't understand how urgently the wife wanted to get this done. I don't know about you, but two weeks can fly by if you're working full time. It's entirely possible that the husband just filed away \"reorganize library\" along with the thousand other things that need to happen at some unspecified time before the baby comes. And, among that list of things, it's reasonable to say reorganize the library is a low priority. Now, the wife happened to have a nesting urge telling her that reorganizing the library was a high priority, but it's entirely possible that there was a miscommunication about how important it was to her. Clearly, the husband was surprised when she started doing it herself, so I think it's a reasonable assumption that the husband didn't understand how important it was to his wife. Of course, it may be that that's on him and he should've known, but we don't really know what their communication was like so we can't say for sure whether he understood the urgency of the matter and blew her off anyway or if he simply didn't understand.", "I meant to support your comment with emphasis from the perspective of the working adult who is taking time to help rearrange and it taking longer because the requestor doesn't know what they want.", "I soon as I read OP\u2019s post I was like, \u201cgirl you are nesting hard!\u201d When I was pregnant I was put on bed rest the last couple weeks but the urge to organize my closet was intense! I would sneak into my closet when my husband wasn\u2019t looking and he would keep having to take me to bed like a child because I wasn\u2019t suppose to be moving around.", "It sounds like it\u2019s dramatic and not true but this is exactly what it\u2019s like, she\u2019ll probably be embarrassed about this when the babies here and everything\u2019s calmed down even though she wasn\u2019t being that dramatic she just decided to do it herself, another tough part of pregnancy is suddenly being \u2018unable\u2019 to do things you\u2019ve done your entire life no problem. I cried because my house wasn\u2019t absolutely immaculate and cleaned with a fine tooth comb and I was too tired and big to do it myself, it was tough on my partner to understand why living the way we\u2019d been living forever was suddenly not up to my standards, because same \ud83d\ude02", "Climbing a ladder can be dangerous for a pregnant woman in the third trimester. Most women experience imbalance due to the extra weight which makes them wobble and more clumsy.", "The wipes warmer. My brain told me that if I didn't get the wipes warmer my child would freeze and cry with every diaper change and the early trauma would give him PTSD. The warmer just dried them out and I threw it away in 2 weeks' time.", "NTA if your hubby is like mine\u2026 chronic procrastinating. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s not busy but his priorities are all out. People can always be busy if they want to be but never get shit done.", "NTA but please, take care :)", "Sorry, did I miss something?  Where did 2 weeks come from?", "She didn't say 2 weeks in the OP. It makes you wonder if she stated it later to make herself look better. Though even if it was two weeks, he may have still been busy. Most people work on 10 of those 14 days and she doesn't go to the trouble to tell us why he was busy. It was not a task that was time sensitive.", "The unreason thing was lying about what he had said to his parents.", "She stated in the comments that she asked him for 2 weeks and he didn\u2019t help her. The only help she asked him for was to remove books from the top shelf. Idk understand where everyone is making the assumptions she wanted him to organize her library for 8 hours. Taking the books off the top shelf would have literally taken minutes. He\u2019s the AH for ignoring his pregnant wife\u2019s request while she\u2019s in the nesting phase. I think there are a ton of people who aren\u2019t familiar with it. It is a psychological compulsion that takes place on pregnancy and she was in the thick of it.", "> which is a biological need during pregnancy. \n\nLOL no.\n\nThis is 'women are naturally hysterical' in modern terms.", "No it is it a biological need, it\u2019s a biological quirk. Eating is a biological need. No real harm will come to a human unable to nest in every room in their home.", "I\u2019m so grateful for this post if for no other reason than all the adorable pregnancy stories", "Have you ever been pregnant? Nesting urges are wild. It's like \"I need this done now or I'll perish\" wild. I remember moving furniture from the second floor to my basement, and not stopping until I was finished. I'm surprised she waited two weeks before doing it herself honestly.", "Yep. I'm pretty sure people would think I was nuts for making a weeks worth of dinners for my family *after my water broke*, but it seemed not only reasonable, but necessary. My husband certainly wasn't going to be feeding the kids anything more than nuggets and Hershey's kisses, so...I took care of it, lol. If I hadn't gone into labor two weeks early, it would've been done ahead of time. \n\n(And no, this should not be another excuse for men to dismiss women as \"too emotional.\" Male-bodied people may have different body chemistry and/or responses, but they are just as affected as are female-bodied people.)", "So much this! I see a lot of comments (not just this post) about how pregnant women aren't invalids, pregnancy cravings doesn't mean you can be selfish, pregnancy doesn't give you an excuse to be an AH, etc. And while I agree on not being an AH part, some of those feelings, compulsions, and wants literally cannot be helped! Hormones are going whack at that time, you really don't feel like yourself.\n\nThis nesting thing - it may not seem important or make sense to anyone else, but for OP, it's probably been causing her stress for weeks!", "That's true. I'm lovingal these stories of women doing crazy Nesting things. But the point of my comment wasn't to say we can just write women off as hormone crazy.\n\nSomething doesn't need to be your priority in order for you to prioritize it - if it's very important to your partner that counts for something. It may not make sense to you, but that's not necessary for you to consider it worthwhile on their behalf.", "Yeah... my thing is, pregnancy doesn't make it ok for you to demand someone give you the last box of thin mints available even though they already purchased it, or steal them from the person if they don't.\n\nIt does make it ok to nicely ask if they'd be willing to let you buy it off them - even though that's kind of weird. Or, if you don't ask, to go sit in your car and cry a while that there are no more thin mints.\n\nIt's a shame we aren't as a society more inclined towards compassion in general.", "She has to *give birth*, that ain't easy.", "Mine was cloth diapers in dozens of little colors.
