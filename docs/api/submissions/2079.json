As someone who has birthed three out of four of my hobbits, I feel you. Especially with my first, I suddenly felt like certain things around the house just weren't right, and desperately wanted to change them. Including redecorating four rooms of our house. My other half, like yours, kept saying he'll do it later. Later came when I gave up and started doing it myself.\n\nMy Mother turned up, took the paint brush off me and her and other half finished it all up \ud83d\ude48.\n\nPoint is, to me, this was really important. To him, he was going to work, doing usual household stuff, and stressing about bringing a child into the world and providing for all of us as a family. The little down time he did have was usually sleeping or finding me obscure snacks.\n\nTo him, the place really didn't need decorating and he didn't put it in the same place on his priority list as I did mine. Not because he didn't care, but because perception is reality.\n\nTo him, redecorating didn't help us, and was a waste of precious time. It was never about him not caring or not being arsed.\n\nBut to *me*, it was important and I felt like he didn't care about me or what was about to be our family home. \n\nMy point is, wires get crossed SO easily when expecting a potato with limbs, and even more in those first six months. Trust me, I wanted to slaughter my husband when our now four year old was born just for breathing wrong.\n\nBe kind to yourself and each other. I would show him this thread if it helps, or if needed sit down and say it was really important to me, but I realise it wasn't for you. My intention wasn't to make you look bad, I was feeling frustrated and that poured over. If I tell you when something is a big deal to me next time, can you go on to help me with it as best you can?\n\n\nGood luck with everything, it's going to be great, take the epidural if you want it, it won't harm the baby. If you can't breast feed, don't struggle and make yourself miserable, formula (unless we're talking Nestle) has never made a baby grow two heads yet. Take advice with a pinch of salt and ignore anyone make you feel guilty. Mum's with several kids will probably have the best advi d for keeping your sanity. If that involves cake for breakfast and a litre of coffee, that's OK. \n\nA happy Mum makes a happy baby, your suffering will not make your baby smarter, happier or healthier.\nA happy Mum usually makes a happy Dad/other Mum, too!\n\nYou've got this, all the love in the world lovely x", "how long did you wait before doing it yourself?", "NTA.

It was only urgent to YOU. If you were tired of waiting and wanted to do it yourself, that's fine, but going around and telling his parents its because he refused to help you was an AH move.

Her and papa raised me to be just a little too independent lol \n\nThe only worry I\u2019d have is the ladder because of balance. My balance was off starting in my second or third trimester but my hubby was usually good at helping when my nesting kicked in. Again, he\u2019d see me cleaning and just jump in and help.\n\nBest of luck OP and I hope you have a smooth labor and delivery when it\u2019s time :)", "Nesting is the craziest thing about being pregnant.", "YTA, moving the items was not something that needed done immediately, no matter what your obsessive urge told you.

You need to apologize.", "NTA", "Eh - your husband isn't responsible for your obsessions.  Organizing the library wasn't urgent - it was something YOU wanted to do.  Which is fine, but it clearly didn't seem urgent or important to your husband.  This wasn't cleaning the kitchen or some other necessary task.\n\nAnd to narc to his parents?  Super petty.

Your husband was working- something essential to keep the money coming in to provide for his family, including your upcoming baby. You just wanted to rearrange things, which I assume were not a problem beforehand (if it ain't broke, why fix it sort of stuff). Yes, you had an urge to rearrange things... but this wasn't an urgent need to be fulfilled. It also required both yours and your husband's consent as you both share the home together.\nTelling his parents he refused to help, when in fact he was providing for you and your family, because you are impatient... is an AH move.", "NTA - two weeks is plenty of time for him to help you get the books down. It wouldn't have taken that long. You could have done the organizing after he help get you started and then just did the top shelves.

I was cleaning closets and cupboards etc.", "Slight YTA. Solely because of how you put it as he wouldn't help you. His answer was that he was busy but would try to make time. To be fair, I don't even have kids or a kid coming any time in the future, and it takes me a while to even find a free moment to clean my kitchen.\n\nYou are currently nesting - hence the obsessive urge to clean. However, this is not an emergency scenario and you are also pregnant, and climbing up on ladders is not safe for anyone pregnant.\n\nTake it easy, and try to find something a little more ground level to work out that need to clean and organize right now - like the baby's room!

Presumably she had to use a step or ladder or something to reach the higher books (what everyone else's concern about it wouldn't make sense).", "NTA. My husband will say later until I either really get on him or just do it myself. The nesting urge is fierce and you showed patience by waiting a few weeks. Did it need done? Logically no.

Can we do it Sunday afternoon?  is an answer.  \n\nIf I spoke anything to your parents that was in any way false, then I'll be happy to apologize for it.", "NTA Nesting is a strong mental drive and can take precedance over everything else. While it can be weaker for some, it can be maddeningly strong and irritating for others to not have their space 'just so'.  When some people think of pregnancy not being an excuse, they think of things like emotional outbursts or cravings, which can certainly be mitigated. Nesting when mot indulged is something that can cause stress and anxiety over time, in this a period of two weeks, which is incredibly bad for the baby. \n\nMaybe you could have said your husband said he would do it but kept putting it off to his parents, but he likely would have gotten scolded anyway. Besides, he definitely could have reorganized things with you at some point in those two weeks.\n\nUltimately, he is in fact an asshole.", "YTA you need to choose your words more wisely.", "YTA your husband was busy and you decided to do a dangerous and strenuous task even though your pregnant .
