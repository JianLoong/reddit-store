She discussed contributing the same amount she did for my brothers wedding. Recently though, she was pushing me to ask my dad (they\u2019re divorced) how much he was willing to pay. She even told me to tell him that she would match however much he wanted to contribute. \n\nI was nervous to ask my dad about money because I haven\u2019t grown up with him really and always feel guilty asking for money. My mom continued to push me. So when I called my dad and his wife were on the phone and gave me a large number they\u2019d contribute and said if I needed anything past that they\u2019d for sure want to help. They kept asking if the amount they gave was enough and asked if my mom was going to help pay. I told them yes because she said she was. \n\nI tell my mom about our conversation and she is overjoyed. I assumed she was happy for me because I had some money towards the wedding fund and therefore didn\u2019t have to stress so much about pricing. \n\nWell she tells me the other day that she assumed that my dad was paying for everything. She seemed very disappointed that wasn\u2019t the outcome of the convo. When I said that I told him she would match him she goes \u201cno way am I matching that\u201d. Then she plunged into this spiel that he should actually pay for it because she has done so much over the years for me. Yet, my dad payed for college and paid his child support. I am 32 and haven\u2019t needed financial help from my mom since I was 22 living on my own. \n\nNow, my mom wants to call my dad directly after telling me over and over that I really need to call him and ask about how much money he would contribute. She knows I hate doing this because I have hated it for years. I always had to call about my tuition payments and any costs they would split. I am nervous as to why she wants to call him all the sudden. Should she not just be happy he is willing to give me so much? I can tell her to not call him\n\nI don\u2019t care about the amount of money my mom wants to give. I just am hurt by the fact she is phrasing it in such a shitty way. It\u2019s just nice when my dad and stepmom and even my fianc\u00e9es mom keep telling us that they want us to have the best wedding that we want and that they\u2019re there to help us out. It\u2019s just the thought that counts. I am by no means an extravagant person and wouldn\u2019t want to waste anyone\u2019s money. All of our families are very well off. Plus all my siblings had extravagant weddings\n\nWe also all discussed the option of having everyone contribute to a joint bank account and whatever money we don\u2019t use for the wedding we can use to hopefully get a house. \n\nI believe that she now knows that he is going to pay a ton it\u2019ll cover the wedding so therefore she doesn\u2019t need to help. I don\u2019t care about the money I care about her not even caring to try and contribute. Every other parent says they want us to have the best wedding that we want whereas she is constantly telling me \u201cthat\u2019s too expensive, that\u2019s too much, wedding days aren\u2019t even important cause it\u2019s only one day\u201d and I\u2019m trying to plan a wedding of less than 10,000 dollars which is frustratingly difficult due to where we live.", "created_utc": 1694775564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ja3o7/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_doesnt_have_to_pay/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is terrible that she has made you be a proxy in these negotiations as a child, but yku are old enough now, you should stand for yourself on this issue.

Maybe open a separate account just for wedding stuff and give her a timeline as to when you\u2019ll need her contributions by.

Take a step back from who pays what and see how much you need over and above what your dad is paying to make the wedding work for you. Then go from there. Unfortunately, your wedding seems to have triggered some chord about her life in your mom and my guess, hope am wrong, is that the drama will continue. \n\nAlso, you are not responsible for your mom. I\u2019m f she wants to ask your dad to fund the marriage, it\u2019s her problem, and not your burden to carry\n\nYou are not responsible for your mom\u2019s drama, the feelings she is having towards\u2026I had to do so much blah\n\nAssume your dad will give atleast what he promised and mom will give drama rather than financial contribution. It is what it is. Focus on wedding planning and keeping your calm. At no point go too over budget hoping mum would pay. If she pays, let it be a bonus, may be return a bit saying mom, you did do much for me always. Am just glad you are here.\n\nAll the best, OP. Weddings bring out the worst of family drama. Many of us have been there. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to be fair, your Mom should contribute the same amount for you that she contributed for your brother.  But she doesn't get a say in how much Dad contributes.", "NTA - People often talk big about what they\u2019ll contribute to things, but then renege in private or worse just go radio silent. She\u2019s showing her true colours. I\u2019m glad your dad and the rest are handling it with more grace.", "NTA. Tell her you'll make do with whatever funding you get from your Dad... and that you'll be sure to tell him she can't or won't contribute.", "So tell her you are willing to accept the same amount as she put to your brother\u2019s wedding.", "NTA. The fuck is she still putting you in the middle of her messy divorce for", "NTA\nYour mom is putting a lot of pressure on you, particularly to influence your dad. She's using your wedding as her opportunity to stir up tensions between you, your dad and stepmom. Now that things between you and your dad haven't caused the upset and resentment she hoped for, she wants to stir the pot with your dad directly.\n\nHer \"help\" is far too costly, imho. Stop letting mom influence your relationship with your dad. Stop telling your mom details about decisions, it's ammunition for her to weaponize. \n\nIf your mom wants to contribute, great. No comparisons to others' contributions. No \"special privileges\" bought by her \"gift.\" You can limit her using your wedding for her own power games by putting her on an information diet and treating her as a respected guest, and nothing more.", "NTA. Your mum though... She's using you as a weapon against your dad. \nPersonally I'd call her on it and if she didn't apologize go NC and uninvite from your wedding. Otherwise this will spiral and risk destroying YOUR day.", "NTA.  You need to get in front of this.  He needs to know that you appreciate his offer and are not rejecting, that you appreciate he did what he did during your childhood, and that your mother is pushing on issues and you are concerned she will start directly pressing him, potentially throwing you under the bus to create drama.  Receive the funds from him and from fianc\u00e9s family you deem appropriate.  Mom can contribute or not.  Structure your wedding around this dynamic - watch language of invitations, identification in program, etc.  Don\u2019t press you mom too far, just recognize her pettiness.", "Ok so I\u2019m petty.  I would speak to your mom to confirm that she is not giving money for the wedding \u201c mom I am working on invitation wording and before I put my only dad and stepmom as hosts  I wanted to confirm you are not interested in giving money into the wedding.\u201d Sickly sweet smile.  My guess that will piss her off enough to give what she had originally promised", "I knew when he told me the amount she wouldn\u2019t match it. But for her to them just assume he is paying for it all is crazy to me. I mean at least make me feel like you want to contribute", "Yet my mom just spend 150k to remodel their home", "I assumed she would hear the number he gave and just say that\u2019s too much I\u2019ll just pay what we originally discussed. Idk what she would want to call him about now when she literally told me to have a drink and get over my nerves of calling my dad and asking about finances a few days ago", "I\u2019m thinking she will use the line \u201che actually should pay for it all since I raised you\u201d even though she moved to another city far enough away to not see my dad easily so therefore I never really grew up with him.", "She thinks now that he is going to pay a ton it\u2019ll cover the wedding so therefore she doesn\u2019t need to help.

What\u2019s happening now is not about you. It\u2019s about her grudge with her ex husband.", "You might want to consider paying for your own wedding. It might be a more modest wedding, but all this stress would just slip away, and there is value in that.", "It is her money to do with what she will. It is just sad that she is now trying to use it to play games with you. Money makes people weird, as working for an estate lawyer for a few yrs taught me.", "When your Mum brings it up again just go \"I'm happy with what Dad has offered and will not be asking for more, so stop telling me to.\" Don't engage further from there, just keep going \"I'm not asking him for more, I'm happy with what he has offered.\"\n\nI would also call your Dad (when your Mum isn't around) and let him know that you're very grateful for the financial help he's offered. Let him know that your Mum is being a bit funny about it all, and if she contacts him to tell him to give you more he is to ignore her as do not support her in this. You don't need or want any more than he has offered. I'd do that side pretty soon as she sounds like she's going to kick up a fuss and you don't want your Dad to think you've been complaining to her.", "Talk to her, not about your dad. They are divorsed, no reason for your mom to trie to tie them up again for your case.", "That is unfortunate. She should be upfront about her intentions. Her pretending that she would match his contributions is shitty. If she doesn't want to pay she shouldn't have offered and she shouldn't be dragging up the past as a justification, especially since the foundation of her argument isn't very stable.", "NTA\u2026since your Mom decided to no longer contribute to your wedding you should inform her she no longer has a say regarding your wedding preparations.  Plan everything your way and ignore any request she makes.  \n\nAs far as her wanting to call your Dad, I would give him a heads up about what has transpired so he isn\u2019t blindsided later on as that could cause him to withdrawal his support or damage what relationship you do have with him.", "Can she fucking get over it? They\u2019ve been divorced for 25 years and we\u2019re only married long enough for her to take half his money when I was a baby", "She really didn't act like she wanted to contribute. Otherwise she would have treated her daughter the same as her sons.", "Apparently, she can't fucking get over it, which says a lot about her (not good, either).  IMO, and ultimatum might be in order.  She either suck it up and play nice, or stay the fuck away and let you enjoy your wedding with people you love and enjoy being around.  I mean, let's just say for arguments sake that she coughs up some funds.  How do you think she'll behave at the wedding?  Probably like the bitter ex that she is.  Who needs that?", "I think at the heart is money.  Your mom doesn't want to pay it.\n\nSo she's making up drama with her ex.  She was hoping her ex offered enough money that she wouldn't have to.  That you would say oh this is enough. We don't need anything from you.\n\nThat didn't work.  So now she's making a big stink instead of saying she doesn't want to pay for your wedding.\n\nOtherwise she would have just given you an amount like she did your brother(s).\n\nLook at the whole process.  She treated you differently from the get-go."]}
