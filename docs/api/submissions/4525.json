That\u2019s champagne taste on a beer budget, and your daughter is the one who pays the price.", "That\u2019s not what they\u2019re asking. \n\nThey want to know if the ~$4000 (estimate) that you\u2019re not putting in now is going to be replaced, ON TOP of normal contributions once you are financially stable enough to contribute again. If you plan on working extra hard to remake that money on top of the money you\u2019ve already agreed to put in monthly indefinitely, you\u2019re less of an asshole. \n\nBut YTA either way. Your irresponsibility caused this, it\u2019s your responsibility to fix it, not just pretend it didn\u2019t happen cause hubby makes more money.", "What I'm asking is, do you need to temporarily limit your contribution to your daughter's college fund so you can pay your share of the bills or are you spending the college fund money on luxuries.", "You have to admit, spending thousands of dollars and not being able to contribute to the college fund does make it look like your money goes more to yourself than your household and daughter. And your attitude about your husband making 10 times more than you isn\u2019t really a good take on it either.\n\n\nYour priorities do seem to be mixed up.", "Why don\u2019t you just explain it to her instead of being a dick about it. It\u2019s not like they teach a money management in school anymore, or home ec. At least she\u2019s smart enough to admit she doesn\u2019t know something."]}
