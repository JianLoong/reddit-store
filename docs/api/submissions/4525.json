The same way it wouldn't be unreasonable for a couple to keep finances separate if one of them is an alcoholic or drug addict.

If they both put 90% of their income into the household, that leaves her with $2/year in discretionary money and him with $10k/year. That\u2019s a pretty big difference. I\u2019m not saying she was right to gamble away an unreasonable amount of money (especially without a prior discussion -but I realize that\u2019s not how booze + gambling works) but it sounds like everything is based on percentages and nothing is combined, although he determines the collective standard of living based on HIS income. So they\u2019re living beyond her means, but she doesn\u2019t have a choice in that although is still expected to contribute.

I get that they each contribute relative to their earnings, but because of this she has a lot less left over for herself. This means that they leave two separate lifestyles, which obviously causes a lot of trouble in the relationship.\n\nI personally don\u2019t understand how a couple with kids can have separate finances.

Childcare is stupid expensive, and daycares are germ factories, so if her kid sniffles wrong she\u2019ll be sent home until it clears up.

She seems to hold resentment for her partner earning more and dies not truly seem happy with the current arrangement. Perhaps giving her a focus outside of home abd more spending money might address that, on top of the recommendations you made (which I fully agree with).\n\n \"Upending the family paradigm is extreme\" - many families do just this and get by fine.  The child will be entering school in a year or so,   this would be expediting a change many go through at that age.\n\n Working for pocket money because you are a fulm time parent at home works well for some people but also isn't for everyone.

Daughter's needs will be covered even though OP dropped the ball, since husband will be able to cover the deficit.\n\nWhat I wanted to clarify is - I'd land on N T A in that situation because while I absolutely don't think it's right that husband should be expected to cover the deficit, I also get the impression that he is comfortable financially and therefore able to make up the difference without having to live off bread and water for a month afterwards. The *family as a whole* seems to be affected very little to not at all by OP's mistake. I think husband stepping in to fix OP's mistake *once* would have put OP in N T A territory if she had owned up to her mistake and not made it again later on, because the mistake itself really doesn't seem to affect the family much at all. Of course, OP is still firmly in YTA territory with her refusal to own up to her mistake and expecting a *three-year-old* to cover her. That's frankly insane.\n\nAlso, I know you didn't respond directly to me, nor do you in any way indicate that you disagree with my reasoning, so pardon me for making it sound like I'm responding to arguments you haven't made. \ud83d\ude42 I just think the point I made about \"OP would be N T A if...\" could seem like I thought OP was right to expect husband to deal with the consequences.

OP also works part time right now, not full time.  Again, OP sucks for being so cavalier about money and for not being honest or trying to understand where her husband is coming from.  Pushing her to work full time to be able to add more money to her kid\u2019s college fund is really discounting the monetary value that her covering childcare brings to the table though.", "I completely understood your original comment and agree with it.
