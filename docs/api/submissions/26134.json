I'm with your friend on this one...if she comes from money then they don't NEED your money to make the trip so why should you pay for them?  Red flag FOR SURE.\n\nCurrently planning a destination wedding, 25 people are on the official invite list..we are covering the cost of flights for two of them and part of the room for one of this two.  The two are my kid (who will be 20 by then and MAY cover their own, but depending on the work situation we are planning to cover their ticket and part of their hotel costs as they will be rooming with a friend of mine)...the other is my fiance's BFF who is officiating the ceremony so we are covering his ticket as the payment for his services.  We know not everyone else will be able to make it because of the cost but we gave them 2 years notice to start saving, if they can't make it we'll be sad but we can't cover anyone else, nor should they expect us to IMO.", "NAH, since I don\u2019t feel like I can really offer a judgement on either of you. Have you discussed how finances will be combined once you are married? From bits and pieces, it sounds like you earn more than her? She seems to be coming from a place of believing that you will be joining finances (mine is yours, yours is mine) and that the costs associated with the wedding are a prime time to start that. You seem to be coming from the perspective that finances will be kept separate. Both mentalities are fine, but you need to get on the same page long before the wedding happens. As you are getting advice from your friends that she might be taking advantage, she likely has people in her ear telling her that you might be selfish or financially abusive.", "Red flag!

If she gives her parents $10,000, isn't that the same as both of you gifting her parents. That $5000 is your money. \n\nHere's my opinion- NAH. She is right that you are gifting your family out of funds that would be joint. She wants a similar spend to her side. You are looking at this as an access issue- providing transport to the venue for those who don't have it.\n\nThe answer here is that you guys need is an understanding of what each person is bringing in. How much each will contribute and how it will be split. Are her wealthy parents going to pay while she is married.

Your parents don't.  **Making it equal is helping your parents have the money power to travel.**  It's not about the money being given, it's about the money making something important happening, **creating equality of access.**\n\n**She's looking at this as if the important part is the** ***money,*** not the access to being at the wedding.\n\nIf your aunt needed a new kidney, and you offered one of yours, would she demand that her aunt also get a new kidney from you?

Stupid example, but it shows how her argument isn't reasonable.\n\n**Does she really believe that this is about the money?**  Does she really believe that you should give your money when someone doesn't need it, just because you give it to someone that does?  What if you had a nephew, orphaned, and you paid for their college?  Would she demand you also pay for one of her siblings' kids college, too?  Even if that one got some earned scholarship or had parents that could easily pay?  \n\n**Does she really believe that the most important thing in this issue is the equality between the sides of the family?**  What if one relative is kind and pleasant to you both, and another relative is cruel, controlling, and bossy?  Do you have to spend equal time with both of them, despite their behaviors?  Or **are you allowed to make your own decisions, as the adults you are,** based on your own private reasons?  \n\n**This isn't a thing that is required.**  If her family thinks it is, they need therapy.   How much money, what gifts, how much time, which holidays, time with kids, time on vacations, all the decisions you two make to do something or not do something with your side/her side of the family, does not have to be balanced by doing the same for the other side.
