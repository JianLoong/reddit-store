You should have called the authorities to get those kids taken away from her.", "NTA. That kid could have died, and she didn't even see it happen. You weren't meddling in other peoples' business, because it **became** your business when you had to rescue the kid.", "you\u2019re right i\u2019m not really someone who likes shouting, but this was a huge safety risk and i couldn\u2019t hold it in. i have a brother who is a similar age and even when he has armbands i get worried with him around water so how on earth she was so relaxed having her two little girls in that pool with no safety is beyond me. i hope i at least prevented her from letting something like this happen again.", "I was in shock at her attitude towards it.

Use them!", "NTA - but as an educational note for other people - armbands are usually not recommended. Kids can get over confident and wind up in deeper water than they\u2019re able to swim in.

At that age I was fully capable of swimming in the deep end without arm bands or anything, even if I fell a bit wrong or so, but my parents would still always keep an eye on me and would certainly react immediately if something happened.

Some parents are so fucking oblivious it\u2019s genuinely baffling. I spent many years working at a ski resort in the terrain park. If you\u2019re unaware think of it like a skate park, but built of snow on a downhill graded slope and with much much bigger jumps and rails and whatever else. Parents would frequently bring their kids in there and allow them to be in very dangerous situations like hanging out in the landings of jumps where they are completely blind for anywhere above them and therefore unseen by riders hitting the jumps. I had many parents try and argue with me when I would point out how unsafe these actions were, 99% told me to fuck off and not tell them how to parent and I always ended those interactions by saying, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to look out for your child\u2019s safety, since it appears to be something you do not care about.\u201d", "NTA lazy parenting sucks and the truth hurts.", "NTA\n\nThe situation clearly required a more aggressive approach.

Some people really need that shake in the head lecture. I couldn\u2019t swim when I was that age and when I went to any pool or lake I had to have an adult with me. It\u2019s common practice. I can\u2019t imagine how the poor girl felt. Thank you for standing up for her. That girl deserves much better protection.", "NTA. You have to be super vigilant when you mix kids and water. That's literally my worst fear, I would have been absolutely panicked.", "Children who cannot swim need an adult in arms reach at all times near the pool.

It is not just the parent\u2019s problem if a child drowns, now is it? As a parent you always have to have your eyes on your children. And if they cannot swim you have to be a helicopter above them and also have them wear life jackets or something else that could safe their life. \n\nChildren mostly drown without any noises. You will probably notice it when it is too late. When I was swimming In my local public pool  around 15-20 years ago the life guard jumped in the pool and I thought what\u2019s happening?

There are rip currents on that beach--I know, because I got caught in one once as a teen--and a kid could grabbed by the current and in thirty seconds be fifty or sixty feet away. Usually they tell me to mind my own business, but often I see them grab the kids when I turn back to look.\n\nDon't even get me started on people who let their kids dig giant holes or tunnels in the beach.

Good job!", "NTA it was a safety issue", "NTA - but I don't get the issue with the armband float thing.  Is this a new thing?  When I was growing up those were for really little kids.  A 6 year old was trusted to swim on their own and this was normal.  I did grow up on a lake though.", "Nta\n\nThats what it takes to school people some times.", "NTA.  She was ignoring her child, who could not swim, while the child was in the pool.  She is the AH and she is mad at you because you are CORRECT.  Thank you for saving the girl's life.", "NTA. It's not your kid op, so you have ZERO obligation to the kid's safety. In my state and town, she would have had DCF called on her.", "NTA I think its completely reasonable to have lost your temper at an unconcerned mother that already had safety equipment for her child and couldn't even be bothered to use it.\n\nYou're a concerned person that essentially had to save a life which is scary in itself, and her lack of reaction or care would have made any concerned person frustrated, hopefully shouting got through to her abit to be honest.", "Your shouting caused her to put the arm bands on her child. That may have saved the child's life. She wouldn't listen before you shouted. You only shouted because she wasn't taking responsibility for her child's safety.", "NTA at all!  When my kids were little, we were always within an arms-length of them when they were younger such as 6 or 7.  After they'd had swim lessons and were older, then they could be in the pool alone, but we still never looked at our phones, hubby & I would be talking  if we weren't in the pool with them and always watching them.  \n\nSince this mom didn't listen and didn't seem to be worried that her kid almost drowned, you brought it up a notch by explaining more thoroughly the details and screaming wasn't great but I can understand why you did so.  NTA.", "NTA!!!!! she should have been more grateful you saved her child\u2019s life, instead she was offended by your honesty. you\u2019re totally right, her daughter could have died", "NTA & she\u2019s very irresponsible. I live in a tourist destination on the Gulf of Mexico in NW Florida. There\u2019s a flag system. Green is safe. Yellow is caution. Red is dangerous. Double red the water is closed. Double red with black squares, closed bc hurricane/ tropical storm. Purple are jellyfish: sharks. \n\nOne of the local cities has now made it a criminal offense of jail & hefty fines if parents/ guardians let children swim during red or double red flags. Rip tides are no joke & the entitled asshole tourists who come here are bound & determined to get in The Gulf, bc they paid good money to come here & by God they are going in the Gulf. This area has had about 10 deaths from drowning so far this season. It puts first responders at risk, their own lives, their children\u2019s lives & others at risk. \n\nI think It should be a murder charge if the flags are flying & they disregard them. \n\nI\u2019m from here, 99% of locals won\u2019t even go in with yellow flags. \n\nI hate tourists. Don\u2019t get me started about the golf carts trying to cross in the major highways where  they are not allowed.", "Nta\n\nIt became your business because she was too busy being preoccupied to actually be a parent.", "Seems weird for a 6yr old to wear armbands. Nta but i do imagine the mom felt like the teen was being extra dramatic. Had the woman thanked her, i doubt she would have said a word", "Oh, you 100% should have shouted at her because she was not being a responsible parent at all.  Happy you were there for the little girl. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nHer daughter nearly drowned because she wasn't watching.", "NTA! You are 100% in the right. Hopefully you woke this negligent mother up to reality.", "NTA why isn\u2019t she in the water with her kids who aren\u2019t able to swim?", "NTA you have more feeling of responsability than the mother hat in this situation. May be she was shocked but won't show a stranger her feelings or could not admit doing something wrong. Her acting shows that she would from now on do better (inflating the armbands). Let it go. She'll never thank you for saving her kids life. Because she had then to admit, she had done something wrong.\nI was years ago in the same Situation. I was the child. I could not swim yet. We were on vacation in south italy. My mother was lying on her towel sleeping at the beach. Me and my syster were playing at the water. We had armbands. But I get in deeper water and get pulled away to the open sea. A man saw me paddling and going under water because of high waves. He brought me back to the beach. My mother never realized what happend. She was even making jokes in the evening. That I could have swam to Sarde. I was shocked and I realized I have to look up for my self. And I thank god to send me an angel in this moment. Just like you. Let me thank you instead. I never had the chance to thank my life savoiur.", "NTA of course. Don't leave kids unsupervised even with floaties. Even with lifejackets. Kids slip and fall into pools and kids slip out of floaties etc. People get so complacent when floaties are involved and it leads to dead kids.", "> Then, an hour later, he was back in the water, with nobody paying attention again!\n\nMy jaw legitimately just dropped reading this wth. The nerve of some people... \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f he literally just drowned, what's the mum thinking?!", "if the mum just reassured me that she would watch her more diligently and hadn\u2019t denied not watching her child i wouldn\u2019t have yelled. i am in no way confrontational but that little girls life was at risk and there was no way i was going to stand there and let this woman put the life of her child in danger", "No it shouldn't ESH, the woman should have been watching her kid and like OP said if they weren't there to help her, the kid would have drowned since it was obvious the mom wasn't even aware of what happened. Op is not the asshole, the mother thu is since she hardly cared that her daughter almost drowned", "My moms biggest regret is letting me have armbands as a kid. 22 now and can swim just enough that I\u2019d be safe if I were to fall but I\u2019m extremely anxious about the water. My siblings (10,4) aren\u2019t allowed them because of this", "Greek coastguard? Or are you assuming that all rules and regulations around the world are the same as in the USA?\n\nArmbands like this are very common in Europe, and even schools use them to start teaching kids how to swim (not all countries:  BE, IE, and RO from experience).", "And they fall off easily.", "First of, NTA\n\nI have been a \"lifeguard\" for 17 years. Its with the \"\" since I started training when i was 8. I am 35 now. This is in Holland.\n\nI have been first aid since 16.\n\nI have taught children sailing for 17 years recently quit.\n\n\nThe amount of mothers that dont pay attention anywhere is insane. Todlers next to heavy metal band speakers, children without any supervision, telling people off while not caring a shyte and on the phone all the time.\n\nI am a very direct person and sometimes I have these moods where I am a bit to direct.\n\nI have made tons of moms cry, yes I was definitely the asshole. Not for telling them they should be more carefully with their kids but I made them cry cus I told them they were bad parents, should give their child up for adoption if they didnt care, told them they should have had an abortion when there was still time (btw never when the kids were around).\n\nMost of the times the moms wouldnt bring the kids anymore but it was dad showing up and while I was rude, I had dads tell me I was right.\n\nSo the way you handled it was just very polite and the harsh truth.", "Tell the hotel owners about it. The last thing they would want is being in the news because a child drowned in their pool. It is likely already an unspoken rule that you keep an eye on your children at the pool. They might insist that they follow it and threaten them to otherwise forbid the use of the pool for them. Maybe it will help. Worth a try.", "If you feel comfortable you should alert the place that manages the pool that a woman has been leaving her young children unaccompanied. \n\nI can guarantee no hotel wants their name in a headline about drowned children and they'll make sure she either acts like a parent or her kids don't swim.", "Wow, maybe it's just where I'm from, but multiple 10 year old kids who can't swim? And using arm bands? My (just this weekend turned)  5yo son is practicing his endurance swimming without any help and he's late. My daughter was free swimming and passed the swim test to swim without an adult at his age. I'm used to 3-5 fully capable swimmers but you keep eyes on regardless of that due to how quickly they can get tired from it though. Not to mention, if you tried to put arm bands on a 10yo they'd flip out embarrassed as they're associated with babies in kiddie pool (like, 6 inches deep kinda thing) ! That's wild! \n\nI promise I'm not judging at all, actually impressed with being so young and so responsible and level headed about it! Just such a massive difference! \n\nNTA, you did great!", "Right? When it happened,  the moms (there were 2 families together, like 6-8 kids) were off floating, and the dads were playing frisbee. I paid more attention to that boy than they did", "At least they are an improvement over letting your child which can't swim in the water with nothing to keep them from drowning. You should have of course still an eye on them and be there at once when they need help.", "A lot of places offer adult swim lessons! I would look into it if you can.", "all three were different ages! the youngest looked to be around 6 and the oldest maybe 9/10? and thank you! i am a young carer to my 10 year old brother due to him being disabled, so even when im out without him im always looking out for other kids (just instinct, maybe? not sure)", "They're not, though, because they give everybody, from the adults to the children, a false sense of security.", "We don't breath from the armpit. Lol. But seriously they seem like a good enough idea but a child could easily drown while wearing them because they don't keep the head out of the water. If the child has been told absolutely nothing about how to swim or if they have been hit in the head or get too tired there can be an accident. A vest is Designed to not only keep you up out of the water it should have the floatation device on the front so your face and chest out if you aren't conscious", "I'm from The Netherlands and we almost exclusecily use armbands. They never break (I'm 28 and have never seen one deflate or slip off for that matter) and make sure the floatation is level. Floaties are dangerous for some young children as most floatation is on one side; all it takes is for them to tip over without supervision. Again, Netherlands. There isn't a child over 7 that isn't safe in water.", "That's why one stays within arms reach of their child, always and attentive. A vest makes it so the child can barely do anything as they can barely move. Again, I'm from The Netherlands so no child under seven doesn't know how to swim. If there is a parent who leaves their child in the pool while they're informed of them not being able to swim, they deserve to be prosecuted. Which they are here.", "Good on your mom! Not going to make excuses for the lifeguards, I\u2019m just glad the woman in charge trained us borderline military style. I spent an hour because I was a millisecond slow doing practice breathing for an infant, and she had me practice till I was doing it perfect. But not all pools are the same. \n\nWhen people are at risk for drowning their only thought is to survive, which can be dangerous for those around them. I\u2019m glad both of you were okay!", "Makes sense. I never had floaties because my parents taught us to actually swim/swam with us/had us in classes. Every time we were in the water we talked about safety.", "I don't think they use them in professional swim lessons. I had lessons 30 years ago, and you were either being supported by the instructor or holding on to the wall while waiting your turn. (Class was about 8 children.)", "Even the life vests aren't really 100% with really young kids.\n\nSource, had a 2 year old in an approved pfd in the pool yesterday and he rolled over face first because he doesn't have any idea how to steady himself in the water.   In that way the floaties with armband are a little better because there is no floatation in the back.  \n\nThe pool floaties I think are about getting a few extra seconds to get to them not about making them 100% safe", "I've def seen it", "You just gotta buy newer better life jackets.  The ones made for babies these days are pretty solid.  Have a big floatation ring around the neck too.", "Yeah, in general most safety devices are \"danger-resistant\" not \"100% danger-free\". Arm floaties and/or life jackets aren't a complete guarantee of safety but if used correctly they do help avoid a toddler simply wandering over the edge of a pool and quietly sinking like a rock. Which I have seen happen more than once, even with adults very close, because tots can be insanely quick when they're getting into mischief!", "Must be shitty lessons haha. We used kickboards only for flotation.", "Oh it's brand new and has the neck flotation ring and a crotch strap to keep it from riding up.  My child is just talented I guess", "Yeah it's the difference between having a hand on them at all times and letting them explore independently just out of reach.  \n\nI know it's important for him to develop confidence and be ok when not surgically attached to me or his dad but we still have to make sure he's safe.", "Don't know anyone who drowned so doesn't seem too shitty to me"]}
