Use them!", "NTA - but as an educational note for other people - armbands are usually not recommended. Kids can get over confident and wind up in deeper water than they\u2019re able to swim in.

At that age I was fully capable of swimming in the deep end without arm bands or anything, even if I fell a bit wrong or so, but my parents would still always keep an eye on me and would certainly react immediately if something happened.

Some parents are so fucking oblivious it\u2019s genuinely baffling. I spent many years working at a ski resort in the terrain park. If you\u2019re unaware think of it like a skate park, but built of snow on a downhill graded slope and with much much bigger jumps and rails and whatever else. Parents would frequently bring their kids in there and allow them to be in very dangerous situations like hanging out in the landings of jumps where they are completely blind for anywhere above them and therefore unseen by riders hitting the jumps. I had many parents try and argue with me when I would point out how unsafe these actions were, 99% told me to fuck off and not tell them how to parent and I always ended those interactions by saying, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to look out for your child\u2019s safety, since it appears to be something you do not care about.\u201d", "NTA lazy parenting sucks and the truth hurts.", "NTA\n\nThe situation clearly required a more aggressive approach.

That's literally my worst fear, I would have been absolutely panicked.", "Children who cannot swim need an adult in arms reach at all times near the pool.

It is not just the parent\u2019s problem if a child drowns, now is it? As a parent you always have to have your eyes on your children. And if they cannot swim you have to be a helicopter above them and also have them wear life jackets or something else that could safe their life. \n\nChildren mostly drown without any noises. You will probably notice it when it is too late. When I was swimming In my local public pool  around 15-20 years ago the life guard jumped in the pool and I thought what\u2019s happening?

There are rip currents on that beach--I know, because I got caught in one once as a teen--and a kid could grabbed by the current and in thirty seconds be fifty or sixty feet away. Usually they tell me to mind my own business, but often I see them grab the kids when I turn back to look.\n\nDon't even get me started on people who let their kids dig giant holes or tunnels in the beach.

I basically flipped upside and freaked out and almost drowned so I'm very inclined to agree.", "My inner 5 year old who had sooooo many arguments with my mother over armbands making it harder to swim thanks you sincerely and offers you some of her post-swim nougat bar :)", "They aren't great for learning to swim, and my kids were actually using something called Schloris instead, but arm bands are absolutely standard here in Germany. Every child uses them. Swimming vests etc are unusual in pools.", "They also give kids a false sense of confidence in their swimming ability and it\u2019s easy for them to forget when they\u2019re not wearing them. On the parenting subreddits there are heaps of stories of near miss drownings where the parent was busy packing away things, the kid decides to get back in the water one last time after the floaties come off and it\u2019s almost a tragedy.", "But they are fixed to the arm just below the arm pit. That's not actually possible, because even with raised arms the arm bands are lower than the ears. Unless we have different arm bands to you?", "It's normal to use them in Germany. Virtually every young child has them and we also have life guards. Maybe the German design is different?", "My kids learned swimming with something called Schloris, a German invention that is both simple and effective.\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/RSF4f9MeokCna4xB8", ">. Also it's very, very frowned upon to leave a child wearing armbands without supervision, so much so that both parent and child will get kicked out of a public pool or beach and sometimes even get prosecuted.\n\nThis is the key part.

I taught swimming and the kids who learned to swim the fastest were the ones who never used puddle jumpers or life jackets. The ones used to puddle jumpers had such a hard time learning to float on their back, as well as learning to use their arms for different strokes.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating that so many parents think their kids will be fine since they have some kind of floaty and there\u2019s lifeguards to watch them. I don\u2019t have kids, but if I did I would be doing the same thing as you.", "Find the approved device that has the floaty armbands connected to a floaty strap that goes across the chest bit doesn't have as much floaty in the back. Basically looks like a lifeguard can (the strap floaties you see beach lifeguards using) and it connects in the back. These have minimal floatation on the back to help prevent rolling onto the face. They aren't perfect; if the person was unconscious and had their head drooped over into the water it wouldn't help.

The only response, as a mother, I can see me having is to cry and hug my child and thank you profusely. Even if she had responded that way and you were snippy, I think it would have been natural.\n\nMama may not remember but I promise the little girl will. We had a bad canoe accident when I was 7 (long story but we had life jackets on and still everything thing that could go wrong did). As we hurtled toward tragedy this big group of drunk college kids was just around the corner and saw us.  They stopped what they were doing and helped us. My mom had to just let me go and let me float down to them. A young guy grabbed me up out of the water and put me on the bank. We\u2019ve never seen them again but I remember his face and blonde hair 30 odd years later. They helped my parents out too and saved our lives without question.

If the kid can't be safe in the water, then the kid doesn't go in the water.", "NTA but as a lifeguard in my youth arm bands are bad. They do not prevent drowning and give people a false sense of security. If your kid can't swim well they need a lifejacket not arm bands. The arm bands do not keep your face out of the water.", "Why is this so low? OP can\u2019t be the asshole, she saved this child\u2019s life. Sorry not sorry for yelling in a situation that warranted it. How come there were no lifeguards posted?", "Armband floaties are definitely not replacements for parental supervision. It has been a long time since I've seen them, but I imagine that it says on the packing and floaties that adult supervision is required.", "better than nothing in the shallow end tho", "I was forced to wear a life jacket in water above my head until I was a teenager, despite being strong enough to swim across a lake. I hated the thing because it always slipped up to my neck and choked me. One beautiful summer day I was playing on a big donut-shaped floaty. You climb in via the hole in the center, then sit on the seats or jump off. Since we were jumping, it was anchored in water above our heads. My mother insisted I wear a life vest, and the adults had fun talking and sunbathing while us kids (I was the oldest at 11) jumped off. \n\nNow, the floaty kept moving as kids jumped off, and I was having trouble finding the center hole while under the water. I asked the other kids to not jump for a minute so I could get up, and I was ignored as usual. So I swam under the floaty with a life vest on. It kept moving and moving. I couldn\u2019t find the hole. I also couldn\u2019t swim under the water because the life vest pinned me to the floaty. I remember I had started inhaling water and saw black spots and then suddenly a light as the floaty moved again. I popped up into the air, choked for a while and laid on my back until I regained the strength to swim to the dock and bawl that I had almost drowned. \n\nParents, keep your eyes on your kids around water. Life vests and a giant floaty nearly took my life before I entered middle school (I remember thinking \u201cI\u2019ll never see sixth grade!\u201d). They\u2019re great if you are watching like a hawk and can immediately pull your kid up if there\u2019s an issue, but they can also cause you to get stuck and drown silently.", "We have one. He just refuses to let us put them on but is ok with the vest", "Maybe depends on the make? You must inflate them on the arm though and get good quality ones, in Germany they would have a T\u00dcV sign, which are our government safety people.", "They are recommended as an option to learn to swim, yes. All of these options, including simple vests, are not for unattended use. \n\nThe random image was just to show you what a T\u00fcv approved arm band looks like, T\u00dcV are the government people responsible for safety, they do your car MOT and other safety things as well. \n\nFor boating one would use life vests, these are for swimming pools. Are you telling my that in the US kids wear those big life vests in pools and the parents don't watch them? You can't swim in them properly, how would they learn?", "NTA.  Exact thing happened here and the kid drowned because mom wasn\u2019t paying attention to her 3 year old and now she\u2019s suing the city saying it was the lifeguards fault.\n \nMeanwhile she posted lots of TikTok\u2019s at the pool nowhere near her son.", "YTA - but the exact perfect A we need.

I think that\u2019s great.

I carried the hysterical child back to his clueless mother who proceeded to yell at me for touching her child.  I didn't even say anything to her.  I just walked away shaking my head.
