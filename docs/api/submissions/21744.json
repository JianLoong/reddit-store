I am also typing on my phone so apologies for formatting or misspelling.\n\nI (18F) am currently on a 2 week holiday in Greece with my dad and his gf. We aren\u2019t at a resort but a family owned hotel which is pretty private, but it has a bar, and a pool. I\u2019m coming up to the end of my stay here which sucks but it\u2019s such a lovely place and i recommend to visit if you ever can.\n\nAnyway, this family arrived yesterday. It\u2019s two mums and 3 young girls which i assume are between the ages of 6-10. One of girls belongs to one woman and the other two to another. So, I was in the pool while these little girls were playing around and having fun in the shallow end, there\u2019s a small ramp in the middle of the pool leading to the deep end and one of the girls was playing on it, slipped, and almost drowned. Luckily, i was nearby and helped this girl up because she was splashing around and struggling to get herself up. I lifted her out and made sure she was alright before following her over to where her mother was sat.\n\nHer mother was oblivious as to what had happened. She was on her phone when her daughter ran over crying because she was scared. I approached her and explained what had happened to which she didn\u2019t seem to care or thank me for helping her daughter, I asked her to keep a closer eye on her kids to which she responded by saying she was watching them. I pointed out that she was too focused on her phone to see her daughter slip and potentially drown as she didn\u2019t even have armbands. This woman then proceeded to tell me i was meddling in someone else\u2019s business and how she watches her kids isn\u2019t my concern and i shouldn\u2019t be lecturing her on watching children when i don\u2019t have any. \n\nThis is where i might be the AH because i blew up on her. I told her that her negligence could\u2019ve cost her daughter her life and that she shouldn\u2019t leave her kids unsupervised in a pool with no armbands on, i asked her what she would have done if i wasn\u2019t there to help her daughter because if she had drowned it would\u2019ve been on her for not watching her child. She called me an asshole and aggressively went through her bag to blow up some armbands which was crazy to me because if she had them then why weren\u2019t they already on her kids?\n\nMy dad and his gf are on my side at least but i feel like i shouldn\u2019t have shouted at her.

Big time!!! Thank you for helping the little girl and you did good for yelling at the mom.", "NTA, hope the woman got the message clearly.", "NTA. You did the right thing.

That \"parent\" needs a wake-up call.  However, based on how it went, it sounds like she doesn't really want that kid / doesn't care if she drowns.\n\nI've been yelled at for talking to kids to try to get them out of dangerous situations.  The last time though was when I told a kid to stop scaling a wrapped pallet of cans of food that was tipping over because it was on it.  His \"mother\" came running from another aisle just to yell at me.  Since then, I've said I would only intervene with a kid in clear danger (e.g. running out into a busy street), mostly because I'm sure they would sue if they could.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re correct and that mother frankly needed a scare because she is genuinely at risk of really harming her kids due to her negligence.

If anything, this just proves how much more responsible than her you are. She should be grateful that you were there, and you should feel happy that the kid will get a chance to experience the rest of her life due to your quick thinking.", "NTA. You NEVER EVER leave a child unsupervised in a pool. Especially if they can\u2019t swim. AND the mom had armbands?!?!? She is just being negligent at that point. You should have called the authorities to get those kids taken away from her.", "NTA. That kid could have died, and she didn't even see it happen. You weren't meddling in other peoples' business, because it **became** your business when you had to rescue the kid.", "you\u2019re right i\u2019m not really someone who likes shouting, but this was a huge safety risk and i couldn\u2019t hold it in. i have a brother who is a similar age and even when he has armbands i get worried with him around water so how on earth she was so relaxed having her two little girls in that pool with no safety is beyond me. i hope i at least prevented her from letting something like this happen again.", "I was in shock at her attitude towards it. My dad said he had seen her just disappear a few times and leave her two girls at the pool alone, so i just worry something like this may happen again but no one will be around to help them :(", "I was so scared myself, i\u2019m pretty small so my biggest worry is that i wouldn\u2019t get her back up. I have a brother around the same age as them and I get anxious whenever he\u2019s around the pool even with armbands and floats on, i seriously have no idea how a parent can be so oblivious and negligent in this situation"]}
