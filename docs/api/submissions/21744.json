I\u2019m coming up to the end of my stay here which sucks but it\u2019s such a lovely place and i recommend to visit if you ever can.\n\nAnyway, this family arrived yesterday. It\u2019s two mums and 3 young girls which i assume are between the ages of 6-10. One of girls belongs to one woman and the other two to another. So, I was in the pool while these little girls were playing around and having fun in the shallow end, there\u2019s a small ramp in the middle of the pool leading to the deep end and one of the girls was playing on it, slipped, and almost drowned. Luckily, i was nearby and helped this girl up because she was splashing around and struggling to get herself up. I lifted her out and made sure she was alright before following her over to where her mother was sat.\n\nHer mother was oblivious as to what had happened. She was on her phone when her daughter ran over crying because she was scared. I approached her and explained what had happened to which she didn\u2019t seem to care or thank me for helping her daughter, I asked her to keep a closer eye on her kids to which she responded by saying she was watching them. I pointed out that she was too focused on her phone to see her daughter slip and potentially drown as she didn\u2019t even have armbands. This woman then proceeded to tell me i was meddling in someone else\u2019s business and how she watches her kids isn\u2019t my concern and i shouldn\u2019t be lecturing her on watching children when i don\u2019t have any. \n\nThis is where i might be the AH because i blew up on her.

She called me an asshole and aggressively went through her bag to blow up some armbands which was crazy to me because if she had them then why weren\u2019t they already on her kids?\n\nMy dad and his gf are on my side at least but i feel like i shouldn\u2019t have shouted at her.

If anything, this just proves how much more responsible than her you are. She should be grateful that you were there, and you should feel happy that the kid will get a chance to experience the rest of her life due to your quick thinking.", "NTA. You NEVER EVER leave a child unsupervised in a pool. Especially if they can\u2019t swim. AND the mom had armbands?!?!? She is just being negligent at that point. You should have called the authorities to get those kids taken away from her.", "NTA. That kid could have died, and she didn't even see it happen. You weren't meddling in other peoples' business, because it **became** your business when you had to rescue the kid.", "you\u2019re right i\u2019m not really someone who likes shouting, but this was a huge safety risk and i couldn\u2019t hold it in. i have a brother who is a similar age and even when he has armbands i get worried with him around water so how on earth she was so relaxed having her two little girls in that pool with no safety is beyond me. i hope i at least prevented her from letting something like this happen again.", "I was in shock at her attitude towards it. My dad said he had seen her just disappear a few times and leave her two girls at the pool alone, so i just worry something like this may happen again but no one will be around to help them :(", "I was so scared myself, i\u2019m pretty small so my biggest worry is that i wouldn\u2019t get her back up. I have a brother around the same age as them and I get anxious whenever he\u2019s around the pool even with armbands and floats on, i seriously have no idea how a parent can be so oblivious and negligent in this situation", "NTA. I honestly applaud you for standing up to her. I can only imagine what else mom neglects!  I hope this was the wake up call she needed to actually care for her children", "NTA at all, you are a hero who saved a little kids life. You should be extremely proud of yourself. If anything you probably didn\u2019t go far enough chewing her out. People like her should have their kids taken away.", "Nta. That's awful! If you have armbands. Use them!", "NTA - but as an educational note for other people - armbands are usually not recommended. Kids can get over confident and wind up in deeper water than they\u2019re able to swim in. Plus as this woman demonstrated, many adults view them as a substitute for adult supervision and they\u2019re simply not.", "NTA. I generally say you shouldn\u2019t comment on people\u2019s parenting. However, when it comes to water safety, shame away! If it saves a kid\u2019s life I would have no regrets.", "NTA, good for you for telling as it is, the mother should have kept an eye on her child.", "NTA. Drowning is quick and silent. That mum is an absolute idiot and you did the right thing.  Hopefully the mum will watch more closely going forward even if it's just because she is worried about being judged by strangers!", "Definitely NOT the AH, the only AH here is the mom. The way you did a better job than the mom says it all.", "NTA, because a kids safety was on the line.", "This is so bizarre to me, she didn't even care when you explained what happened? Wow. At that age I was fully capable of swimming in the deep end without arm bands or anything, even if I fell a bit wrong or so, but my parents would still always keep an eye on me and would certainly react immediately if something happened. This chill attitude is just baffling. How fortunate that you saved that kid! NTA", "NTA She is a bad parent.  \n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Some parents are so fucking oblivious it\u2019s genuinely baffling. I spent many years working at a ski resort in the terrain park. If you\u2019re unaware think of it like a skate park, but built of snow on a downhill graded slope and with much much bigger jumps and rails and whatever else. Parents would frequently bring their kids in there and allow them to be in very dangerous situations like hanging out in the landings of jumps where they are completely blind for anywhere above them and therefore unseen by riders hitting the jumps. I had many parents try and argue with me when I would point out how unsafe these actions were, 99% told me to fuck off and not tell them how to parent and I always ended those interactions by saying, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to look out for your child\u2019s safety, since it appears to be something you do not care about.\u201d", "NTA lazy parenting sucks and the truth hurts.", "NTA\n\nThe situation clearly required a more aggressive approach. She didn't start to inflate those armbands until you shouted. This type of people only respond to being loudly shamed.", "OP, you're a hero in more ways than one! Saving a child's life *and* publicly shaming dangerous parenting :) awesome", "NTA easily could\u2019ve drowned, nobody thinks it could happen to their kids yet every year kids are drowning. You did the right thing", "NTA! That lady just mad because you called her out on her shit and instead of owning up, she decided to excuse it by telling you to mind your business. \n\nOn the flip side what if you had minded your business? Then she would\u2019ve blamed you for not \u201chelping\u201d or \u201crescuing\u201d the child. People like that always have a problem to the solution because they don\u2019t know how to own up to their BS.", "NTA - I would have yelled at the mom also, so many people are so forced on their phone when they should be paying attention to their kids.", "NTA better a scolding than a funeral", "NTA. Some people really need that shake in the head lecture. I couldn\u2019t swim when I was that age and when I went to any pool or lake I had to have an adult with me. It\u2019s common practice. I can\u2019t imagine how the poor girl felt. Thank you for standing up for her. That girl deserves much better protection.", "NTA. You have to be super vigilant when you mix kids and water. That's literally my worst fear, I would have been absolutely panicked.", "Children who cannot swim need an adult in arms reach at all times near the pool. You\u2019re not the adult that was supposed to be supervising but because of a negligent mom, you had to save a child\u2019s life. Water safety is paramount! \n\nNTA and I\u2019d go to the front desk and let them know too, for liability purposes.", "NTA. You\u2019re right that if the kid drowned it would\u2019ve been on her. But you can be sure she\u2019d have tried to blame you. She absolutely needed a shouting at.", "Yikes, that's a bit extreme. But yeah, mom should've been more watchful. ESH.", "Absolutely NTA.", "I'm an ex-lifeguard this would have been on the mom. She is responsible to watch the kid in water or anything else that can be dangerous. I just want to point armband floaties are not as safe as people think. They aren't coast guard approved floatation devices. They make kids overconfident and have gotten themselves into trouble.", "NTA . People don't realise drowning is silent. Not shouting ,no screams, just water entering your nose and mouth cutting off all chances of making any sound.", "That mum is an absolute idiot and you did the right thing.", "And I Would Have Gotten Away With It\" SUPERCUT!", "Exactly. It is not just the parent\u2019s problem if a child drowns, now is it? As a parent you always have to have your eyes on your children. And if they cannot swim you have to be a helicopter above them and also have them wear life jackets or something else that could safe their life. \n\nChildren mostly drown without any noises. You will probably notice it when it is too late. When I was swimming In my local public pool  around 15-20 years ago the life guard jumped in the pool and I thought what\u2019s happening? Turned out a small child went from the shallow end to the deeper part. Luckily the life guard was there within literally 10 seconds because he saw it happen. But nobody else around the child noticed before he jumped in the pool.", " Her kid could have drowned if you weren't there.", " She has to wake up before it's too late, cause next time it's possible for her to lose her kid.", "[removed]", "NTA. !!!\nDrowning is often silent. The big \"splashing around production, trying to scream\" is Hollywood, not real. \nBecause it is often silent, parents should keep an eye on their children in a pool and avoid any distractions.", "#NTA. \n\n\nGet off the damn phone and interact with you kids \ud83d\ude44", "#NTA I can only imagine what else mom neglects! I hope this was the wake up call she needed to actually care for her children", "Those arm floaters are not approved floatation devices in the US and can slip off a wet kid in an instant, but I guess they are better than nothing.", "I don\u2019t understand using floats and bands as a way to justify not watching your kids. i\u2019ve mentioned this in a few comments but my younger brother is 10 and even with floats, bands, and me in the pool with him i still get extremely anxious that i may look away for a few seconds and something could go wrong. this woman is so negligent and i just hope that this was a big wake up for her. I understand that she may want to enjoy her holiday too but if you bring your kids with you then you aren\u2019t suddenly exempt from your responsibilities as a parent just because you\u2019re on a holiday!", "Thank you! peoples arguments about armband floaties drive me bonkers, they\u2019re not safe!", "NTA! go you! you probably feel guilty because you", "Ex lifeguard too, and right when I read \u2018arm bands\u2019 I felt that same annoyance come up from every time I had to tell a parent they could not use them, those parents always were argumentative. Arm bands are extremely unsafe. If your kid can\u2019t swim you should A: stay within arms reach of them at all times, or B: get them a proper life vest and still watch them.", "Stollen comment from u/reddirtgirl57", "NTA OP.  I don\u2019t know what the laws are in Greece, but back here, that mom could have possibly been hit with a negligent homicide charge for failing to provide adequate supervision for her child.", "She got angry because a younger woman was criticizing her. It's an age issue.\n\nAlso. Nta.", "Sincerely, I salute you for resisting her. I'm not sure what else mum misses! I hope this served as the wake-up call she needed to start taking proper care of her kids."]}
