He wanted to adopt me and change my name, he wanted me to write my name so he could get it tattooed on his body, he wanted me to dedicate Father's Day for him, he wanted to be *my* dad, something he has pointed out a lot. He has begged me before to call him dad and I always say, we can be close, but he will never be called dad by me, that the title is special for my dad. He said he wants to be that special to me. That I am his only kid and he thinks he is a good enough guy to be my only dad.\n\nMy mom always sides with him and asks why I can't let him be dad too. Like it's something I should want or do just because he wants it.\n\nHe came home the other day and announced he had signed us up for the dance.

I lost it and yelled at him saying he can't make me go and he can go fuck himself and his father/daughter dance and get it through his head that he will never be my father. My mom yelled at me for yelling at him. He yelled at me for yelling at him. They said it was not my place and they don't care how mad I am, yelling is not the answer. I told them speaking calmly and clearly doesn't help so what else am I supposed to do. He said I am supposed to love him and accept him.

Don\u2019t go to that dance and enable his behaviour OP.", "NTA! OP has established clear boundaries. She does not view him as her dad. She understands that he will never replace her dad but still doesn't want to give hime the title. And her mom is only egging Stepdad on. She doesn't want to go to the dance. Stepdad went over her head and signed them up. How is she supposed to react when they will not respect her wishes. Everything stepdad is doing is textbook of what not to do. \n\nAll the responses from people saying she is to blame are probably step parents who probably feel slighted that their step children didn't accept them instead of allowing the relationship to build on its own.", "NTA at all. I have a very similar life situation.. but I didn\u2019t say no. I did let him adopt me and change my name. I did call him dad. And it\u2019s probably one of my biggest regrets. I plan on changing my name back as soon as I can afford it. The fact that he\u2019s not listening to you and forcing himself onto you like this is a major red flag. I\u2019m sorry you have to go through this, and I\u2019m sorry your mother is condoning it.", "NTA. Tell him no decent male role model teaches a girl that she HAS to love a man or accept that man as having a right to the relationship HE has unilaterally decided he wants with her, just because he behaves like a \"nice guy\". Tell him that by saying, \"I get to be your dad because I want it and I've been good,\" he is no better than the incels who insist \"You HAVE to give me a chance to be your boyfriend because I am a Nice Guy, and if you don't, I get to whine and stalk you and throw tantrums and set you up on forced dates until you do.\"\n\nMaybe that'll get through to him, or at least your mom.", "NTA.

A good stepfather who cares about his stepdaughter would not pressure you like this. A good dad would respect your boundaries and accept that your father will never be replaceable and that it\u2019s not his job to replace your dad. \nIt almost seems like he\u2019s trying to put on a show for other people and like he only cares about his own feelings. If he really cared about you as much as he says he does then he\u2019d respect your wishes and try to actually create a bond with you. \nI feel like he\u2019s trying to tell the world, \u201clook at me! I\u2019m such a great guy for playing daddy to this poor girl who lost a father! Wow, I\u2019m such a great person!\u201d \nSorry you\u2019re going through this, OP. I hope your stepfather finally gets it through his thick skull that he\u2019s never going to be able to replace your father.", "NTA.

I'm sorry you're going through this.\n\nIs there an adult third party who can intervene for you? Aunt, uncle guidance councilor?

She's only been married to my dad for a couple of years. Jenny (name change) is wonderful. She's supportive and kind and loving. She's never once asked me or expected me to call her mom. My mom passed away, and my mom was in my life and my best friend for 26 years. Jenny knows this and respects this. Her own kids don't call my dad, \"dad,\" because they are in the same boat I am. It's about respect for you and your dad. This guy will never be your dad. He can be a father like figure, but he will never be dad to you. He needs to accept this. Your mom and step dad need to stop pushing this on you, i don't condone you yelling at them. However, one person can only take so much pushing.", "NTA\n\nUgh, how creepy.  He's chronically overbearing, intrusive, and now is trying to insist on prolonged physical contact.  \"Love and accept\" him?  No, stand your ground.", "NTA, he ignored your wishes.", "OP, you're NTA, this guy doesn't take no as an answer and your mom doesn't defend you.", "NTA. Love and accept him? Like his unhealthy fixation on you and Complete lack of acceptance of Your wants and feelings? \n\nI get loving a kid not biologically yours and wanting to be loved back. But he passed that ages ago. He honestly sounds like a creep.", "Good God.\n\nMy mother married a really creepy guy who was very inappropriate towards me to put it mildly and I could never call him anything father - he is just my mom's creepy 2nd (ex) husband whom she finally left when he tried to seriously harm her.\n\nSo I find this shit super triggering and have no sympathy for \"step\" parents that try to force themselves onto the kid.\n\nYou are NTA and this guy sounds really strange and creepy wanting your handwritten name tattooed on his body.   I have such a creepy feeling from the things you mentioned here and how he is trying to force himself into your life.    yucky.\n\nNTA at all.   He is a creepy AH.   I am glad you told him to fuck himself!   Let him know where he stands with you.   I know you are grounded but he needs to know there is no hope in hell that he can get so close to you.\n\nYou have my sympathy.", "NTA. Your step-dad can *want* to be your dad. That's understandable, normal even. What he can't do is force you against your will to see him as your dad no matter how you feel about it. It's frankly kinda fucked up that he can't take no for an answer and shows a lot of disrespect towards you as an individual with your own feelings.\n\nYou're not \"supposed to\" love him and accept him. You can love him if you love him, you can accept him if you want to. He seems to have some pretty fucked up ideas, and I'm not sure if they're fucked up ideas about women or fucked up ideas about children or both, but rest assured your step-dad's behavior is weird as fuck and disrespectful towards you, even if he and your mother refuse to see that.", "NTA. Your stepfather and mother are, though.\n\nYour stepfather started pushing you into a relationship that you weren't ready for right from the beginning. Instead of respecting your need for space, he's been pushing harder and harder. Then your mother jumped into the situation.\n\nYou were still grieving your father, and still are. You were not ready for any other father figure at 8 years old, and after years of cajoling and badgering by your stepfather (and mother), by now, even if you were ready to accept another father figure, it would probably be anyone *but* him. \n\nYour stepfather should accept your boundaries. He's only driving a bigger wedge between the two of you by trying to force a relationship that does not exist. Your mother needs to back off from that, too.", "YTA \n\nI get that he's not your real dad and that your dad has died. But going to a father daughelter dance doesn't ruin your memory of your dad doing things with your step dad that should be for dads only doesn't ruin how important his role in your life has been, despite him dying when you were so young. \n\nAnd yeah, yelling at him and telling him to fk off for a dance is really too much. \n\nYeah, he seems like he's pushing you too much but he's not deleting tour father from your life, no one wants that from you, he just wants a place in your life and you're no giving him any chance.", "Everything you describe sounds like a guy that has genuinely wanted to be an important figure to you and you pushing him away because of labels.\n\nYTA, gently cuz you seem young.\n\nEdit: I realize I might get down voted for this, and I'm even on the precipice on this, but here's the thing - being a step parent can be hard and if he's been a positive person in her life for this long the avoidance of including him in *some* capacity is unwarranted.\n\nI'm not saying anyone has to call him dad, but I do feel like there's an avoidance to even try here. Imagine how hurtful it would be to help raise a child for years and get pushed away at every turn of affection? To care deeply about them and they're not even willing to go to a dance (or even suggest another activity, instead resorting to yelling).", "ESH. Him for signing up when you didn't want to and trying to push a relationship you aren't ready for, and you for the way you blew up at him. \n\nI'm a dad myself, and in my 40s, so I think I can understand how he feels. But he's way off base and emotionally blind to try and force father-daughter relationship on you. He may well love you as a daughter, but you don't have to return that feeling. I think some sort of family counseling might help, though I don't know if your parents would agree to that. \n\nHe needs to accept that you don't feel what he feels, even if that hurts. Maybe you guys will be friends when you're in your 20s, or if you have kids one day he'll be a great grandpa to them or something. But if he keeps pushing you will feel more resistance.", "ESH.    \n\n\nLong monologue ahead:   \n\n\nHe loves you dearly and is proud to be  in your life as a male, father-like (but NOT father) figure.  You absolutely don't have to call him dad.  My stepdad is Dave (name changed for anonymity).  Dave is Dave.  That being said, I still love Dave and am thankful for him - he's not my dad.  But he's \"My Dave\" or Otosan (I met Dave while I was still involved with karate and Otosan is \"dad\" in Japanese...  \n\n\nDave respects that he's not my actual dad.  But having a cute name for him shows that I value him.  \n\n\nAll that aside, he sucks for not respecting your boundaries about calling him \"dad.\"  But I hate to say it, without knowing more details about your relationship with him... it sounds like you suck just a little for completely shutting him out as your mom's husband, not someone who is significant to you.  I would say he sucks 80% but you suck 20%.  This is just sucky all around.  \n\n\nWith all that said, as strangers, we don't know if you are super cold to him or open to him.  And we don't know if he truly cares for you or if he just wants the vanity title of \"dad\" because it makes him feel fancy.  That's why ESH today.", "YTA, you have the right to not want him to be your father figure and be clear about it but he has clearly tried to be there for you since the beginning and was just trying to have a nice bonding moment with you. It was unnecessary to cuss him out when you could have just calmly explained that you would rather spend time together in some other way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There was no reason for him to sign up for something like that without consulting her first.  \n\nWas she wrong for yelling, yes. However, I understand the frustration she must feel after telling him for 8 years that he can\u2019t replace her father and him ignoring her feelings.", "Are there any relatives you can confide in about what\u2019s going on?", "I feel like you misthought his actions, and he pushed you too much. \n\nOfc other males wouldn't ask you that, it's something a dad or step-dad do, because that's what their presence in your life means. \n\nHe clearly went overboard in the years trying to get you to show some love to him, but you are being way too hard on him.", "But they have a relationship. You all are acting as if he randomly showed up throughout the years, just asking to be called dad and delete completely her real father figure. Have you ever thought that he did things for her, and she has been a prick to hi  just because he wasn't her real dad ? The world is not black and white, as you all are trying to make it be. \n\nNo one deserves anything. He just wants a chance that op has never given him. As she said, she has never shown any appreciation to him despite living together, suppprting her in various ways that op cant even understand (because yes, when youre a kid you also have a closed view and cant understand everything around you), loving her and not being shitty like most step parents are, who usually just want the children from previous marriages to disappear. And op has never given him anything despite him trying his best to be I  her life.\n\nAt some point in life, she'll understand she was a fool not to try forming some type of bond with him, because despite him asking to be called dad, he's not there only for that, but for the whole package. \n\nWith this, I'm finished, I'm tired of this post. I won't reply anymore.", "No I don\u2019t that\u2019s just literally what you said.", "Tell me what you've done to make him feel like a valued figure in your life aside from the dad issue. I'm not saying this all falls on you, but the fact that you are blowing up over him wanting to be a part of your life in the only way that makes ANY sense (he's screwing your mom, can't be an uncle).\n\nHe's not your father, but whether or not you like it is the patriarch if your family and seems to care a lot about you.\n\nI'm willing to go N A H if family counseling seemed a priority.", "Buy?\n\nBeing a step parent is quite often more work than writing a check.", "To try to be open to accepting someone even though it might be awkward because of a personal fear of replacing someone else?", "OK but people with dads that are alive still are capable of celebrating their step-fathers on fathers day. Or even their grandfathers!", "no she isnt, he is being incredibly entitled, a stepdad should strive to be called dad but they are never entitled to that title", "No she's really not. She told him her boundaries and he constantly pushes them.", "It amazes me how you miraculously jumped in my head and knew my context. I literally explained the context. But go off.", "I don't do anything to make him feel valued by me. He's not really. I don't love him. I don't like him (anymore, but I used to). He's not important to me. I don't really want to try and make this work when he has pushed so much over all these years. I am tired of him pushing. I am tired of him forcing himself into a role that is not available.", "And that's the stepparents problem.  Not the kids to accept them.", "Buy doesn't have to mean cash; any investment of time or money from an adult is a donation, not transactional.", "That such a obligation exists.", "She never chose to have him be part of her life! She was subject to her mother\u2019s choice. And she\u2019s been clear from the start! Step dad needs to back off. OP does not need to have any relationship with him she doesn\u2019t want to have. And a father-daughter dance?  Aside from being a repugnant concept, it is absolutely gross overstepping.", "Sure, some do. Not everyone does. Some keep Father's Day for dad's and granddad's or just dad's depending. All of my friends who have stepparents just celebrate their bio mom and dad on Mother's/Father's Day. None consider their stepparent on that day. Some do a Stepfamily day thing. That's the normal in my direct experience.", "Or of ignoring any of them unworthy of the attention.  No one is entitled to it.", "I don't feel like he's acting like he's entitled. To me, he's trying (with the wrong ways) to be that person to her. He loves her and over the year has pushed too much, but I wouldn't call him an entitled. \n\nWe clearly have different views on this, so I'll agree to disagree.", "Okay you dunce but your context is still saying that lmao. Just cause there\u2019s no abuse/craziness doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019d be a good step dad. Not to mention, him doing all this stuff IS a form of abuse. So your comprehension is super lacking.", "Don't listen to that Iso.   No man (or woman) should be forcing themselves on you, ever.  Neither emotionally or otherwise.   \n\nIt was your mother who invited him to step parent you.   If he wants to feel valued and loved he can get that from her.    \n\nNobody gets to do things for you that you didn't ask them to do, then demand things from you because of it.   \n\nHad he not been trying to force closeness on you, you may have warmed up to him.   This demand that he be your one and only dad is really sick.", "Well, that's your prerogative.\n\nBut unless you have something bigger to reveal about the dynamic, I feel like that kind of makes you an AH.", "Does wanting to be considered a parent by a step child warrant unworthiness?", "he is trying to be a good father yes, but he thinks he deserves being called dad regardless of her feelings on the subject, so yes he is incredibly entitled", "An AH for not reciprocating someone's feelings?  Your world would be a stalker's paradise.", "If he tries forcing the relationship, of course.  It must happen organically, i.e. the kid has to acknowledge it voluntarily.  Trying to force a relationship only breeds resistance, resentment,and eventually hate.", "No,but forcing it down the kids' throat and punishing them for not complying does.", "Does wanting a relationship with someone who does not want that relationship with you, and pouting, sulking, throwing tantrums, and attempting to force that relationship on them when they say no, all because you're a \"nice person\" and \"only want to love them\" (in a way they do not wish to be loved), strike you as acceptable behavior?", "Please don't badly misconstrue my words, it's silly and unnecessary.\n\nI accept I have the outlying opinion, because I think if a step parents worse thing going for them is a desire to be involved and included, a very human quality, than they're probably a pretty good step parent", "Again, that's not the kids problem to deal with. That's on the stepparent not knowing their place.", "\u201cPlease don\u2019t badly misconstrue my words\u201d bro your words are the entire problem. You think that this man trying to force a child to give him love and affection is 1. Okay and 2. A quality of a good step parent. \n\nSo my one question is, who didn\u2019t respect your boundaries and taught you that behavior like this is okay? Because you should really figure that out and work on it before telling this person that they need fucking therapy because her overbearing stepfather makes her uncomfortable.", "It's one thing to want that status; it's entirely another to force it on an unwilling minor.  The former is laudable; the second contemptible.  No one is EVER entitled to having his/her feelings reciprocated.", "\n\nOP has better insight than their mom and stepparent. The adults could do well to take a page out of the OP\u2019s handbook of how to conduct themselves. OP blew up at step father because his actions were the final straw. No amount of taking was going to get it through his cranium that his boundary stomping was not appreciated. Step father FAFO\u2019d."]}
