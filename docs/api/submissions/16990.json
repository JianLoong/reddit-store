It's being run through my music club. I even told my music teacher that I didn't want to be on the list to get mail about it. She understood. But then my stepdad heard about it from a friend of his whose young daughter is in the same music school. He decided he would ignore what I wanted and sign us both up for it. He's been in my life since I was 8 and has wanted to be given a \"dad\" thing ever since. Even though I was old enough when my dad died to know who he was and to have made sure dad was only for him and is a special title to me that nobody else can hold. Even though I have rejected all his attempts to \"really become my dad\" like he wanted. He wanted to adopt me and change my name, he wanted me to write my name so he could get it tattooed on his body, he wanted me to dedicate Father's Day for him, he wanted to be *my* dad, something he has pointed out a lot. He has begged me before to call him dad and I always say, we can be close, but he will never be called dad by me, that the title is special for my dad. He said he wants to be that special to me. That I am his only kid and he thinks he is a good enough guy to be my only dad.\n\nMy mom always sides with him and asks why I can't let him be dad too. Like it's something I should want or do just because he wants it.\n\nHe came home the other day and announced he had signed us up for the dance. He said there was no way he was going to let this opportunity pass and how I could do this one thing for him even if I don't want to, because it will be fun. I lost it and yelled at him saying he can't make me go and he can go fuck himself and his father/daughter dance and get it through his head that he will never be my father. My mom yelled at me for yelling at him. He yelled at me for yelling at him. They said it was not my place and they don't care how mad I am, yelling is not the answer. I told them speaking calmly and clearly doesn't help so what else am I supposed to do. He said I am supposed to love him and accept him. I now get to miss a bunch of stuff for yelling and only got to keep laptop and internet access because of school.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683829097, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13evc91/aita_for_yelling_at_my_stepdad_for_signing_us_up/", "score": 990, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t go to that dance and enable his behaviour OP.", "NTA! OP has established clear boundaries. She does not view him as her dad. She understands that he will never replace her dad but still doesn't want to give hime the title. And her mom is only egging Stepdad on. She doesn't want to go to the dance. Stepdad went over her head and signed them up. How is she supposed to react when they will not respect her wishes. Everything stepdad is doing is textbook of what not to do. \n\nAll the responses from people saying she is to blame are probably step parents who probably feel slighted that their step children didn't accept them instead of allowing the relationship to build on its own.", "NTA at all. I have a very similar life situation.. but I didn\u2019t say no. I did let him adopt me and change my name. I did call him dad. And it\u2019s probably one of my biggest regrets. I plan on changing my name back as soon as I can afford it. The fact that he\u2019s not listening to you and forcing himself onto you like this is a major red flag. I\u2019m sorry you have to go through this, and I\u2019m sorry your mother is condoning it.", "NTA. Tell him no decent male role model teaches a girl that she HAS to love a man or accept that man as having a right to the relationship HE has unilaterally decided he wants with her, just because he behaves like a \"nice guy\". Tell him that by saying, \"I get to be your dad because I want it and I've been good,\" he is no better than the incels who insist \"You HAVE to give me a chance to be your boyfriend because I am a Nice Guy, and if you don't, I get to whine and stalk you and throw tantrums and set you up on forced dates until you do.\"\n\nMaybe that'll get through to him, or at least your mom.", "NTA.

A good stepfather who cares about his stepdaughter would not pressure you like this. A good dad would respect your boundaries and accept that your father will never be replaceable and that it\u2019s not his job to replace your dad. \nIt almost seems like he\u2019s trying to put on a show for other people and like he only cares about his own feelings. If he really cared about you as much as he says he does then he\u2019d respect your wishes and try to actually create a bond with you. \nI feel like he\u2019s trying to tell the world, \u201clook at me! I\u2019m such a great guy for playing daddy to this poor girl who lost a father! Wow, I\u2019m such a great person!\u201d \nSorry you\u2019re going through this, OP. I hope your stepfather finally gets it through his thick skull that he\u2019s never going to be able to replace your father.", "NTA. I can appreciate that he wants to bond with you and have a good relationship, but it sounds like he's trying to force it and that's just going to drive a wedge.", "NTA. I'm sorry you're going through this.\n\nIs there an adult third party who can intervene for you? Aunt, uncle guidance councilor?

She's only been married to my dad for a couple of years. Jenny (name change) is wonderful. She's supportive and kind and loving. She's never once asked me or expected me to call her mom. My mom passed away, and my mom was in my life and my best friend for 26 years. Jenny knows this and respects this. Her own kids don't call my dad, \"dad,\" because they are in the same boat I am. It's about respect for you and your dad. This guy will never be your dad. He can be a father like figure, but he will never be dad to you. He needs to accept this. Your mom and step dad need to stop pushing this on you, i don't condone you yelling at them. However, one person can only take so much pushing.", "NTA\n\nUgh, how creepy.  He's chronically overbearing, intrusive, and now is trying to insist on prolonged physical contact.  \"Love and accept\" him?  No, stand your ground.", "NTA, he ignored your wishes.", "OP, you're NTA, this guy doesn't take no as an answer and your mom doesn't defend you.", "NTA. Love and accept him?

He honestly sounds like a creep.", "Good God.\n\nMy mother married a really creepy guy who was very inappropriate towards me to put it mildly and I could never call him anything father - he is just my mom's creepy 2nd (ex) husband whom she finally left when he tried to seriously harm her.\n\nSo I find this shit super triggering and have no sympathy for \"step\" parents that try to force themselves onto the kid.\n\nYou are NTA and this guy sounds really strange and creepy wanting your handwritten name tattooed on his body.   I have such a creepy feeling from the things you mentioned here and how he is trying to force himself into your life.    yucky.\n\nNTA at all.   He is a creepy AH.   I am glad you told him to fuck himself!   Let him know where he stands with you.   I know you are grounded but he needs to know there is no hope in hell that he can get so close to you.\n\nYou have my sympathy.", "NTA. Your step-dad can *want* to be your dad. That's understandable, normal even. What he can't do is force you against your will to see him as your dad no matter how you feel about it. It's frankly kinda fucked up that he can't take no for an answer and shows a lot of disrespect towards you as an individual with your own feelings.\n\nYou're not \"supposed to\" love him and accept him. You can love him if you love him, you can accept him if you want to. He seems to have some pretty fucked up ideas, and I'm not sure if they're fucked up ideas about women or fucked up ideas about children or both, but rest assured your step-dad's behavior is weird as fuck and disrespectful towards you, even if he and your mother refuse to see that.\n\nEdit: and just since others touched on it, no, even after blowing up at him, still NTA. If he and your mother did one thing right raising you it was teaching you to be a girl who stands up for herself when a man is pushing her to do something she doesn't want to do and won't take no for an answer no matter what she says.", "NTA. Your stepfather and mother are, though.\n\nYour stepfather started pushing you into a relationship that you weren't ready for right from the beginning. Instead of respecting your need for space, he's been pushing harder and harder. Then your mother jumped into the situation.\n\nYou were still grieving your father, and still are. You were not ready for any other father figure at 8 years old, and after years of cajoling and badgering by your stepfather (and mother), by now, even if you were ready to accept another father figure, it would probably be anyone *but* him. \n\nYour stepfather should accept your boundaries. He's only driving a bigger wedge between the two of you by trying to force a relationship that does not exist. Your mother needs to back off from that, too.", "YTA \n\nI get that he's not your real dad and that your dad has died. But going to a father daughelter dance doesn't ruin your memory of your dad doing things with your step dad that should be for dads only doesn't ruin how important his role in your life has been, despite him dying when you were so young. \n\nAnd yeah, yelling at him and telling him to fk off for a dance is really too much. \n\nYeah, he seems like he's pushing you too much but he's not deleting tour father from your life, no one wants that from you, he just wants a place in your life and you're no giving him any chance.", "Everything you describe sounds like a guy that has genuinely wanted to be an important figure to you and you pushing him away because of labels.\n\nYTA, gently cuz you seem young.\n\nEdit: I realize I might get down voted for this, and I'm even on the precipice on this, but here's the thing - being a step parent can be hard and if he's been a positive person in her life for this long the avoidance of including him in *some* capacity is unwarranted.\n\nI'm not saying anyone has to call him dad, but I do feel like there's an avoidance to even try here. Imagine how hurtful it would be to help raise a child for years and get pushed away at every turn of affection? To care deeply about them and they're not even willing to go to a dance (or even suggest another activity, instead resorting to yelling).", "ESH. Him for signing up when you didn't want to and trying to push a relationship you aren't ready for, and you for the way you blew up at him. \n\nI'm a dad myself, and in my 40s, so I think I can understand how he feels. But he's way off base and emotionally blind to try and force father-daughter relationship on you. He may well love you as a daughter, but you don't have to return that feeling. I think some sort of family counseling might help, though I don't know if your parents would agree to that. \n\nHe needs to accept that you don't feel what he feels, even if that hurts. Maybe you guys will be friends when you're in your 20s, or if you have kids one day he'll be a great grandpa to them or something. But if he keeps pushing you will feel more resistance.", "ESH.    \n\n\nLong monologue ahead:   \n\n\nHe loves you dearly and is proud to be  in your life as a male, father-like (but NOT father) figure.  You absolutely don't have to call him dad.  My stepdad is Dave (name changed for anonymity).  Dave is Dave.  That being said, I still love Dave and am thankful for him - he's not my dad.  But he's \"My Dave\" or Otosan (I met Dave while I was still involved with karate and Otosan is \"dad\" in Japanese...  \n\n\nDave respects that he's not my actual dad.  But having a cute name for him shows that I value him.  \n\n\nAll that aside, he sucks for not respecting your boundaries about calling him \"dad.\"  But I hate to say it, without knowing more details about your relationship with him... it sounds like you suck just a little for completely shutting him out as your mom's husband, not someone who is significant to you.  I would say he sucks 80% but you suck 20%.  This is just sucky all around.  \n\n\nWith all that said, as strangers, we don't know if you are super cold to him or open to him.  And we don't know if he truly cares for you or if he just wants the vanity title of \"dad\" because it makes him feel fancy.  That's why ESH today.", "YTA, you have the right to not want him to be your father figure and be clear about it but he has clearly tried to be there for you since the beginning and was just trying to have a nice bonding moment with you. It was unnecessary to cuss him out when you could have just calmly explained that you would rather spend time together in some other way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
