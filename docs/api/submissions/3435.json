Problem solved, you won't have to hear it anymore. OR you can continue going to therapy. Clearly your sister needs it. I think your sister was really too young to understand the way you did when your dad remarried. \n\nHere is an example....when my brother passed away my son was 1. My parents basically replaced their son with mine and I think that might be what your sister did too. Does she remember much about your mom? She needed the love and comfort of a mom. You do too if you'd let her be one. \n\nBeing adopted doesn't mean you forget your mom. You will never forget her. She lives in you and everything you do.

Your dad's wife knows she isn't replacing your mom, she is just trying to love you like her own. Something I wish I had growing up....

You can have a decent relationship with your stepmother without her being a parental figure.

His kids are my sisters to me though and my sister and I are to them. They don't consider my mom their mom, but they like her and enjoy being with her. \n\nBoth her and your sister need to accept that your relationship is different but both of them trying to force things is making it very hard for you to enjoy the relationship you have formed and get along. It is your choice, I hope they can accept it before you give up on them.", "\"Dad, this is no longer my issue. I have wants and needs of my own that you are ignoring.

You didn't want that, and legally she is not your mom, but your stepmom. \n\nI would remind her of this when she tries to correct you. That for you, your mom is gone, but for her, she has a living mom, and that neither of you are wrong in how you feel. \n\nI'd also ask her how she would feel if you constantly \"corrected\" her by saying, \"she's not your mom. Your mom passed away\". It would hurt...a lot.

The constant harassment is designed to wear you down until you conform to her ideas about how you should relate to your stepmom and she'll probably keep escalating since your father and stepmother are enabling it. Unfortunately your father is enabling it at this point probably because he probably buys into your sister's fantasy. It's also possible this is a GC/scapegoat dynamic.  \n\n\nBoth he and your sister seem to identify the problem as being your behavior and NOT hers.

You were 9 and had more memories of your mom and were understandably more resistant to the idea of someone \u201creplacing\u201d her. As someone who became a stepmother when the child was 9, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect a child that age to just full on accept you as their new mommy and run with this new family. It\u2019s much healthier for the child if the stepparent is introduced as New Adult in Your Life, and you are allowed to let that relationship develop in a way that feels natural for you; forcing the issues of calling a stepparent Mom and adoption are always a recipe for disaster. \n\nThat said\u2026 allowing your stepmom to legally adopt you will give both her and you legal benefits that you are probably not even thinking about at 17.

That they\u2019re continuing to tolerate (if not encourage) sister\u2019s actions virtually ensures that this will be an issue forever no matter how many therapists they wind up seeing.\n\nI feel badly for OP since this dynamic is very unlikely to change.", "That's because the only progress they'll accept is you giving in. And seriously do not", "NTA", "NTA, but it sounds like you and your dad might need some sessions with the therapist together.

Obviously this will work only if they're one-on-one sessions, not together with your sister - who from the sounds of it has a bunch of other issues she needs to deal with. Maybe  since your dad insists on therapy, you can agree on condition that you have private sessions, and then use those sessions in the way that benefits you most. You may even find that as you start to focus your attention on other stuff, outside of the complicated family dynamic, you start feeling less stressed and are more able to just let your sister's nagging roll over you.", "NTA. Therapy isn't mind control and your dad is being an AH for using it like that. I'm happy your therapist was on your side in this because your agency as a person is important.

I know too many people that get pushed away from wanting therapy in general because of situations like this.", "Maybe your therapist should talk to your sister specifically about her feeling of security and how it depends or doesn\u2019t depend on you. How she feels is about her own internal state. She has the very valid need to feel secure and safe, but she needs to realize your actions will not guarantee her feelings of insecurity will disappear. There are probably other things your parents (dad and step mom) or you can do for her and with her. Your sister needs to be open to trying other things, and not be fixated only on that one option that she can think of right now.", "Sadly, this is a good example of the difference between \"please help heal my family, whatever form that takes\" versus \"make my son see why he's wrong and how he's destroying the family.\" I can only imagine how frustrating it would be to hear the second reason as a professional.", "I will tell you why you are not making progress with the therapist. Because you are treating the wrong issue.\n\nI am pretty sure this isn't about your step mom, or you not loving your step mom. This is about your sister feeling like a trator to your mom. Like she is doing something wrong because she wanted a new mom and you didn't, you are holding the fort and she is the one that ran away and betrayed your mom.\n\nReality is your mom would have wanted for both of you to be happy, she wouldn't feel bad If either of you adopted your step mom as their second mom. You both are dealing with this in a too black and white way. But the real reason she feels bad, is not because of your step moms feelings.\n\nYou want to make progress? I think you need to shift the focus. Focus hard on the fact that she is not a trator or anything else bad for accepting your step mom. When you say \"I never wanted another mom\". It just make it sound like wanting another mom is wrong. To be honest even if you say you are ok with your sister wanting another mom, I don't truly think you are ok with it. You don't like she replaced your mom, she feels like a trator because she replaced your mom, but you didn't.\n\nStop making it black and white. Your mom is your mom and will always be your mom, for both of you. Your step mom, is a second mom, it is not a replacement. No one can replace another person, they can help fill a void, but they can't replace another person. I think your step mom is wrong on keep pressing the issue of you accepting her as a mom. You should talk to your father and her, you can't accept her, maybe you won't ever, but you certainly don't feel free to do it because they want to force you and it is causing a wedge.\n\nThen in your therapy try to address this, why do you feel this is a black and white thing. Wasn't this woman good to you? Wasnt this woman there when you were scared? When you were sick? What did she do for making you dislike her? I mean it sounds like she was too eager to be your mom. It doesn't mean she wanted to replace your mom, she just wanted to be there for you. Some people think that a way to help is to make you forget, she made you dislike her by doing that. If that is the reason, try to forgive her, if really that is the only thing she did, she made a mistake. Yes she is the adult, she should know better, guess what? Adults mess up too. If that is really the only bad thing, I think you should be able to forgive her. It will be good for you.\n\nNow, forgiving her doesn't mean calling her mom, it just means letting go of the anger. You don't need to go into fighting matches with your sister when she calls her your mom (for both of you) everyone knows she really is not your mom, and they dont know you can clarify it later. For all intent an purposes she is under the mom umbrella, it serves no purpose to fight over it, other than strand you from your sister.\n\nWhen you guys go to the therapist, you need to help your sister realize that you have 2 moms, and she likes to call her step mom, mom, and that's ok, and you prefer to call her step mom. Ask her, if step mom died now, and father married again, would she like calling the new step mom, mom right away? It is the same, you were older, you remember more your mom and calling her that, matter of fact it may be the second reason why she resents you, she doesn't remember your mom.\n\nIn any case, this just a guess, but you are NTA. You are trying the best you can, you are still young. I would advise against giving up on your family. I would also use therapy to discuss your feelings about your dad and step mom, I sense you are angry, I mean it makes sense if they have been pushing you for so long, but anger is not healthy."]}
