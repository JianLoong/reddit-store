We were close when she was little and then our mom died and our dad remarried. My sister adores dad's wife and called her mom from almost the beginning and then she later adopted her. Dad's wife wanted to adopt me too but I didn't want to be adopted and I was never in the mindset that she was now my mom. I was 9 when she and dad married and my sister was 6.\n\nMy sister has always been bothered by my not calling dad's wife mom and by turning down the adoption. She corrects me when I say stepmother or dad's wife and I correct her if she says our mom (I don't correct her when she says my mom when talking about their relationship). It has caused many problems. My dad put me into therapy and tried to find some reason for me to say no to the adoption, saying it was a good thing to have happen. He also wanted me to drop the step occasionally where I never considered her my mom and I was go as far as saying I don't count her in terms of my parents. My dad's wife has made it clear she would love to adopt me still and wants me to consider it.\n\nMy relationship with my sister has gone to hell. We argue a lot. She's hurt I reject our stepmother as my mom. I hate the way she expects me to call stepmom *mom* and allow her to adopt me. I started to avoid her because of the arguing. She started telling everyone who would listen that I was wrong. Dad got us therapy together when I declared in the middle of her correcting me and saying how wrong I am that I could not wait to move out because I won't have to deal with this shit.\n\nWe're on our second therapist but therapy doesn't help. My sister has talked about how much more secure she would feel if I called our stepmother *mom* and how much it hurts her that I don't love the woman to embraced us and how she feels like we're less siblings because of it. The therapists both tried to help explain it to her to no avail and she's on me worse than before because she has heard my feelings from me. \n\nI said I was done with therapy. I told my dad our relationship might just be a lost cause until she can let it go. He told me I can't stop therapy and I would be an asshole to stop when it's important for our family.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669641974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6wjkw/aita_for_saying_i_wont_go_to_therapy_anymore/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also you don't need to an emotional open book to people who disrespect your boundaries.", "NTA talk to the therapist and ask if a session with the whole family will help them understand it\u2019s okay for you stand your ground.

Try to get better. Save money. Move out.", "NTA.  Relationships go both ways, you have to respect each others feelings & opinions.  Your sister just wants things her way, or no way at all.  So, it's no way at all... period.  You can't be forced to therapy IF she's not willing to listen.  She does not validate your feelings, sounds to me like she needs the therapy more than you do, BUT it's just not helping her.  Yeah, she's a lost cause & I do not blame you one bit for wanting to move out of there as soon as you possibly can.  A sister who is not willing to meet you somewhere in the middle, a dad who is forcing you to go to therapy, & a stepmom whom you obviously don't see as your mom cannot make for a happy home life.  So sorry you're going through all this!  Wish you the best in your life & your future away from that house.", "NTA. If I were you, I would ask for a few private sessions to sort out a healthy way to deal with your sister's behavior though. As an adopted child who married an adopted child and has a lot of friends who were adopted children, I understand a whole gamut of responses to adoptions. The obsession your sister has about you referring to your stepmom as your stepmom isn't uncommon. Lots of adopted kids are insecure about their relationships and wind up with serious relationship problems because of it. Your sister needs private sessions to deal with her emotional baggage.\n\nI would also during the private sessions ask your therapist to explain to your dad that group sessions are creating resentment that is counterproductive to your mental health.", "NTA. Your sister needs therapy for sure though. She's projecting her own hurt about losing her mamma onto you. If you accept a new mom, then she can ignore the old one. Request a solo therapist or ask the therapist to meet with you separately from your sister. \n\nDad, however?? He needs to back off or he will lose you. He's already really close, I'll bet.", "NTA.

It sounds like your dad and sister are pushing, but is she taking a back seat? Is there any chance you could recruit her as an ally to try to drive home that both of you are happy with this relationship as is? It seems like they're worried you're rejecting her.", "NTA. The fact that a therapist is trying to tell your sister to respect your feelings and she just cant or wont is silly. Your family is trying to use therapy to force you to change your feelings instead of using it so everyone understands everyones feelings and respects them. Pretty sure thats not how therapy works lol. Im sorry your family wont respect you but like you said youll be 18 soon and can move out if you want/can.", "Nta. You could go to therapy and talk about your loss and the people around you not giving you time to grieve, before shoving a replacement down your throat. \n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA Stick to your guns. I wonder if it's because your sister feels guilty for betraying your mom and she's being forceful because of it. She sees you loyal to your birth mother and maybe that's why it's such a sore spot for her. She's hell bent on covering up the guilt.", "NTA. A good therapist in my book would tell your dad at 17. If you say I'm done drop it. You're not looking at self-harm and don't want a mom replacement.", "NTA your dad and step mom need to also be reinforcing to her that you not choosing to be adopted by your step mom is 100% valid, and your choice.", "NTA - It sounds like sister and dad need to take a step back and try to be more understanding. You deserve respect for your decision. I'm so sorry that you're dealing with this. Has dad perhaps attended one of these sessions and made it a family session? It sounds like he could also benefit from actually hearing from the therapist rather than just assuming he knows best.", "NTA\n\nThere's no sides here. No wrong or right. You and your sister feel entitled to your feelings and neither of you wants to budge. Therapy only works when the patients feel the need to change, feel there's something to heal from; in your case, it's a waste of time and money.", "NTA \n\nTell your dad that therapy is not a hammer to brainwash you into doing what he and your sister want. \n\nHe is also TA for pushing this and not protecting you like a good parent should.", "NTA. Your family needs therapy until everyone realizes and accepts that both of your feelings are valid. Neither one of you needs to correct the other when addressing your stepmother. She can call her mom, and you can call her step mom. Both are appropriate. Your dad and step mom need to drop the adoption discussion with you. If they drop it, your sister might drop it if she feels like her stepmom is okay with it.", "NAH. You are at peace with your decision to NOT threat your stepmom as your new mom. It's your decision. And it's a valid one.\n\nI hope your sister continues therapy tho. It seems like all her behaviours roots from insecurities after the traumatic event of losing her birth mom. I don't blame her for not being able to process her trauma as good as you do...", "NTA it's a shame you don't consider her your mom but that's your feelings and choice to make. Nobody else should be telling you how to feel and make you feel wrong because of it.", "No A-holes Here.\n\nIf you don't want therapy you should never be told you have to do it no matter what the extenuating circumstances are. Therapy will never work if you're dragged along to it, and outside of court mandated therapy it is unethical to insist someone complete a series of sessions.\n\nYour family want you to continue because it brings them peace of mind, but at the same time you're allowed to have your reservations. If your sister wants to sort out how she feels still she can talk it through without you having to do group therapy - she can reflect on how all this sits with her with one-on-one sessions and work towards coping with the fact you don't want to examine this issue further as it currently sits.\n\nJust keep an open mind that just because therapy isn't for you right now, that doesn't mean you'll never need to talk through this tricky issue again. In fact, your family should also try to understand that your feelings now don't define the rest of your life on this particular topic. You are allowed to revisit how you feel about all this later.\n\nHope things resolve enough for the time being, good luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Problem solved, you won't have to hear it anymore. OR you can continue going to therapy. Clearly your sister needs it. I think your sister was really too young to understand the way you did when your dad remarried. \n\nHere is an example....when my brother passed away my son was 1. My parents basically replaced their son with mine and I think that might be what your sister did too. Does she remember much about your mom? She needed the love and comfort of a mom. You do too if you'd let her be one. \n\nBeing adopted doesn't mean you forget your mom. You will never forget her. She lives in you and everything you do. Maybe try a solo session or two with the therapist. It might just help you too, if you give it a chance. You deserve to feel the same love your sister does from her and it seems like that is what she wants to give to you, you are the typical pigheaded teen and dealing with those emotions are hard. \n\nIs there something you could ALL do as a family to remember your mom? Your dad's wife knows she isn't replacing your mom, she is just trying to love you like her own. Something I wish I had growing up....

You can have a decent relationship with your stepmother without her being a parental figure.

His kids are my sisters to me though and my sister and I are to them. They don't consider my mom their mom, but they like her and enjoy being with her. \n\nBoth her and your sister need to accept that your relationship is different but both of them trying to force things is making it very hard for you to enjoy the relationship you have formed and get along. It is your choice, I hope they can accept it before you give up on them.", "\"Dad, this is no longer my issue. I have wants and needs of my own that you are ignoring.

The age difference won't be huge when she's 26 and you're 29, but right now it is. She's just barely a teenager and you're almost a legal adult. \n\nYour stepmom adopted her and is therefore legally her mom. You didn't want that, and legally she is not your mom, but your stepmom. \n\nI would remind her of this when she tries to correct you. That for you, your mom is gone, but for her, she has a living mom, and that neither of you are wrong in how you feel. \n\nI'd also ask her how she would feel if you constantly \"corrected\" her by saying, \"she's not your mom. Your mom passed away\". It would hurt...a lot. So if she realises that from you would hurt her, she should realise how what she says affects you.", "Dad is trying to therapy OP into compliance and prob getting annoyed at OP not complying, not realizing it's the rest of them that are the issue for not recognizing OP's autonomy and the value of OP's own feelings."]}
