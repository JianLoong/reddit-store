The constant harassment is designed to wear you down until you conform to her ideas about how you should relate to your stepmom and she'll probably keep escalating since your father and stepmother are enabling it. Unfortunately your father is enabling it at this point probably because he probably buys into your sister's fantasy. It's also possible this is a GC/scapegoat dynamic.  \n\n\nBoth he and your sister seem to identify the problem as being your behavior and NOT hers.

Because you are treating the wrong issue.\n\nI am pretty sure this isn't about your step mom, or you not loving your step mom. This is about your sister feeling like a trator to your mom. Like she is doing something wrong because she wanted a new mom and you didn't, you are holding the fort and she is the one that ran away and betrayed your mom.\n\nReality is your mom would have wanted for both of you to be happy, she wouldn't feel bad If either of you adopted your step mom as their second mom. You both are dealing with this in a too black and white way. But the real reason she feels bad, is not because of your step moms feelings.\n\nYou want to make progress? I think you need to shift the focus. Focus hard on the fact that she is not a trator or anything else bad for accepting your step mom. When you say \"I never wanted another mom\". It just make it sound like wanting another mom is wrong. To be honest even if you say you are ok with your sister wanting another mom, I don't truly think you are ok with it. You don't like she replaced your mom, she feels like a trator because she replaced your mom, but you didn't.\n\nStop making it black and white. Your mom is your mom and will always be your mom, for both of you. Your step mom, is a second mom, it is not a replacement. No one can replace another person, they can help fill a void, but they can't replace another person. I think your step mom is wrong on keep pressing the issue of you accepting her as a mom. You should talk to your father and her, you can't accept her, maybe you won't ever, but you certainly don't feel free to do it because they want to force you and it is causing a wedge.\n\nThen in your therapy try to address this, why do you feel this is a black and white thing. Wasn't this woman good to you? Wasnt this woman there when you were scared? When you were sick? What did she do for making you dislike her? I mean it sounds like she was too eager to be your mom. It doesn't mean she wanted to replace your mom, she just wanted to be there for you. Some people think that a way to help is to make you forget, she made you dislike her by doing that. If that is the reason, try to forgive her, if really that is the only thing she did, she made a mistake. Yes she is the adult, she should know better, guess what? Adults mess up too. If that is really the only bad thing, I think you should be able to forgive her. It will be good for you.\n\nNow, forgiving her doesn't mean calling her mom, it just means letting go of the anger. You don't need to go into fighting matches with your sister when she calls her your mom (for both of you) everyone knows she really is not your mom, and they dont know you can clarify it later. For all intent an purposes she is under the mom umbrella, it serves no purpose to fight over it, other than strand you from your sister.\n\nWhen you guys go to the therapist, you need to help your sister realize that you have 2 moms, and she likes to call her step mom, mom, and that's ok, and you prefer to call her step mom. Ask her, if step mom died now, and father married again, would she like calling the new step mom, mom right away? It is the same, you were older, you remember more your mom and calling her that, matter of fact it may be the second reason why she resents you, she doesn't remember your mom.\n\nIn any case, this just a guess, but you are NTA. You are trying the best you can, you are still young. I would advise against giving up on your family.

If you can get her in your corner\u2026she would have a lot of moral influence over your dad & sister.", "NTA", "OP not sure if this helps you but my bio mom has been out of my life since I was 15.  Pretty much lived with my grandparents.   In my residency, met a women whom I called Ms_______.  Told me she was old enough to be my mom.  I started calling her mom.  She was more of a mom to me than my bio mom.  Comforted me when I was down, reprimanded me when I was wrong.  She will never replace your bio mom but she sounds like a loving and caring person. Give her a chance", "I'm waffling between N T A and E S H because of you correcting your sister when she says \"our mom.\" If she wants to have that bond with your father's wife she has every right to it; I can see why it bothers you, but in the long run it's probably better to give your sister that one thing.\n\nBut that said, you deserve the same respect she wants. Neither of you should have the other's desires forced on you. You knew your bio-mom longer than your sister and have more of a bond with her. That is not wrong, nor should it be discarded because she died. They clearly expect the therapy to help them force their will upon you which is not what therapy is for.\n\nIn the end I think my scales tilt to NTA. Give your sister the one concession by no longer correcting her saying \"our mom,\" and save up so you can move out and no longer have to deal with this.", "I agree op should do separate therapy from the sister. Use the time to focus on himself. She\u2019ll never understand or change with the parents reinforcing her ideals at home and ignoring the therapist. She\u2019ll never understand how the adults in her life are manipulating and using her to harm her own brother.", "Notice how OP says they're on their 2nd therapist. How much do you want to bet that the 1st one was siding with OP and the parents decided to take them to a new therapist.", "I'd lay even money odds on that.", "There will never be progress if their definition of progress is that she stays the same and you start complying. \n\nMaybe suggesting individual therapy for both of you (perhaps with the current therapist) could be a good compromise. You could surely use the support and the therapist might reach your sister better one on one. To convince your parents, you can make it sound temporary, such as suggesting 3-4 individual sessions each before coming back to joint appointments. Run it by the therapist first.", "Tell her you will cut her off when you turn 18 if she doesn't respect your feelings towards the issue.", "I read it as a way to help her sister empathize. A lot is in the delivery which can get lost in text.  The sister can be told all day that OP's viewpoint is valid but there is a difference between knowing and realizing/sympathizing.", ">I said I was done with therapy. I told my dad our relationship might just be a lost cause until she can let it go. He told me I can't stop therapy and I would be an asshole to stop when it's important for our family.\n\nNTA because this is a ridiculous take. It's only \"important\" to your family, because they think at some point hamming on enough therapists will lead to you breaking and letting yourself be adopted. They have to know that they're just gonna drive you away, that their family is going to be forever broken the moment you turn 18 and can simply elect to not go to therapy.", "NTA your dad needs to go to therapy too. This is a very toxic situation. How you feel is completely normal. What\u2019s abnormal is the fact that they are attempting to force what would be an artificial family bond with the stepmother. They are achieving the exact opposite of what they want with their behavior and causing you a lot of mental and emotional trauma.", "NTA. Kinda ironic that your stepmom seems to respect you the most here as while she wants you to consider adoption she isnt pushing as hard as your dad/sister. If that\u2019s true have you considered asking her to get your dad to drop this?", "NTA\n\nNext appointment tell the therapist exactly what you told your father.  And further point out how you feel about the entire situation.", "No. Your sister has issues and should be doing therapy by herself. Imagine her out in the world demanding other people do whatever she feels.", "Nta", "Not making progress or not making the progress they want? In this case 2 very different things", "NTA. Therapy doesn't work because your family is misusing it. They want to use it to \"fix\" you by forcing you to their will. They SHOULD be using it to accept that they can't control other people's feelings or actions, and to learn productive ways to deal with the emotions caused when people don't react the way they want. YOU are not the problem. The problem exists because they are CREATING it. What's important for your family is them getting over it and letting you have your own feelings and boundaries.", "100% NTA, and I\u2019m so sorry your family won\u2019t validate your completely acceptable feelings, especially your father. It sounds like maybe moving on to a \u201cnew mom\u201d helps your sister avoid the pain of acknowledging the loss of her biological mom. You don\u2019t want to ignore your loss, and I commend you for that. Hopefully as you two get older, you can start to understand each other and forgive each other for handling a terrible tragedy in very different ways", "NTA.  Therapy isn\u2019t going to help.  Tell him when he has lost you completely maybe then he will get your sister in therapy to deal with her issues by herself.  You are not responsible for her problems.  Your dad and his wife are responsible for pushing it on you and encouraging her to push you when you had said no.  No means no.  It should have been the end of the matter.", "Your family needs *individual* therapy, and you deserved to be respected. \n\nAre there like legal/financial reasons they want that? \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSeems like your Dad wants you to go to therapy until you give in to what everyone wants.\n\nYou need to have therapy with your Dad and step mother and they need to be on your side.\n\nStop interacting with your sister.", "OP, are any of your mom's family in your life? Anyone you could talk to, that could maybe back you up?\n\nHave you tried saying to your sister/dad/dad's wife that as long as they are harassing you the adoption will never happen. That if they want there to be even a small iota of a chance then they need to silence your sister and stop her harassment and bullying of you. I'm not saying this is true, but it could help you buy time until you're out of the house.\n\nAlso, if I knew a teen in my life was going through this I would gladly offer them a safe place. To visit or to live. I don't know if you know any adults you trust, but there are people who might help if they knew (a friend's parent, a family member, a god parent, your mom's best friends,etc). The trick is finding them. \n\nNTA", "Seriously? No. OP is NTA. You are being one though. I met my stepmother younger than even OP\u2019s sibling and never called her anything but her name or my stepmother. If it was a school thing, I might say \u201cmy parents\u201d because it was easier but she was always just her name. Never Mom. I wasn\u2019t a \u201cpig headed teen\u201d which is fucking rude, I simply didn\u2019t have that relationship with her and I lived with her until I was 18.", "I wonder if therapy with stepmom would help. I doubt it would if it was with dad (could just make him more upset). But if a therapist could help op explain his feelings to stepmom maybe she could get the others off his back. He might even be able to have a somewhat ok relationship with her. Probably better than the relationship he now has with sister and dad.", " No there was progress. It's just they refuse progress", "Nta, I was 8 when my parents separated and my father got his current girlfriend, I don\u2019t even call her my step mom. Nor do I call my adoptive parent my step dad or father. not sure why your father and sister is so set on you calling your step mom your mother, it\u2019s entirely up to you if that\u2019s what you want to call her. Nta. Nothing is wrong with calling her your step mom, that\u2019s what she is. Your sister has known her for much longer in her life which is probably why she\u2019s so set on her being called \u201cmom\u201d. It\u2019s completely understandable you don\u2019t want to call her \u201cmom\u201d and there is absolutely nothing wrong with you not wanting to. Your family is making a big drama out of nothing and frankly it\u2019s quite silly. Your sister can call her mom if she likes, you do not have to, period.", "NTA OP  i know its probably hard to feel sane when the whole world is telling you youre crazy but please know that it is 100% okay to not feel like she is your mother your feelings are valid so are your sister but her actions arent you are not crazy and it is normal and okay to feel that way", "Maybe your sister needs individual therapy.", "NTA and send your dad the link to your post so he can see the comments. Most important to note here is that you remember your mom, your sister does not. They are trying to fix the wrong person. You are good. They are not. They need therapy to learn to deal and move on. I wouldn't be surprised if your step-mom isn't confiding in your sister how hurt she is that you don't call her mom or see her as \"mom. If they don't stop this nonsense, they will eventually lose you completely.", "NTA. Btw, if you tell the therapist \"I do not consent to this treatment,\" they cannot ethically continue.", "Feel very uncomfortable giving ratings related to teenager behaviour about such a complex family dynamic. OP- your sister is still 14 years old, you are 17. Did no one bring it up in therapy that both y\u2019all are too young and can have wildly different opinions about the whole situation once you introspect when you guys are older? That it was too premature for both of you to be forming such strong opinions about this right now to the point that it affects your relationship? You aren\u2019t the AH here. But you\u2019re the older one and closer to adulthood- so at least I can suggest to you this - You may or may not decide to open up to the possibility of seeing your stepmom as a mom figure down the line, you never know what life will bring you. We know you don\u2019t see it right now, and that\u2019s okay. But it is just bad if your relationship with your sister is getting affected like this, and this can just fester resentment unnecessarily. Therapists dont solve everything, and your dad and stepmom need to recognize the gravity of the situation. Maybe its time to approach dad and the stepmom, especially the stepmom and ask them to talk to your sister and explain to her that every child is unique and can make different decisions about parents in their lives- no one is evil here. Your stepmom, if she really cares for the family, should recognize that your sister may listen to her say its perfectly okay for you to not see her as your mom, and still be part of the same family, with respect for everyone. Definitions are not as important as respect, ever. And if you are constantly judged by your sister for something so deeply personal, its actually her disrespecting your feelings, as unintended it may be. Not fair to you. If nothing works, would suggest to ask your dad to protect you from these discussions till you are much older so that your mental health isn\u2019t affected, and set some boundaries in the house.", "Therapist here \ud83d\udc4b I totally agree. Therapy is not about manipulating people\u2019s feelings to be more like someone else\u2019s. You (OP) have every right to feel the way you do about your dad\u2019s wife\u2026just as much as your sister has every right to feel the way she does. It sounds like there is something deeper going on with your sister that she should explore in individual therapy.\nETA: Before discontinuing, I would suggest having a session with you, sis, and your dad so the therapist can explain to him that it\u2019s not an appropriate use of therapy to force you to go unless/until you change your mind.  That is *not* what therapy is for.", "I have not because she does keep bringing it up and reminding me that she wants me to consider it. She's not as bad but I don't need to keep having it brought up when I have never considered it and never would.", "There are financial and legal reasons too. Like the security of it all and some of the benefits from her job. But those are not things I am willing to get by being adopted.", "My mom's family are in my life. They know what's been happening. But there's nothing they can really do.", "I don't want another mom. I never wanted that. My mom was too good of a one for me to want a new one. Or another one or whatever.", "My dad would never protect me because he agrees with my sister. He wants our relationship to be better but I don't think he wants to give up the idea that I will see his wife as my mom either. It doesn't matter how many times I say I don't want it and will never want it. I know you said that could change but I have never wavered on that. Doesn't matter who my dad married after mom. I have a mom who I love and miss and she was too good in my view to have another mom. She was enough. Even dead, she's enough. I have other women in my life who are people I love and care about but nobody will ever be mom or close to what my mom was to me. I can't see a time where I would turn to my dad's wife over them, or even my friends honestly.", "I feel for you. You are entitled to make your decision about it now and in the future, and if its the same, its the same. Just saying you should know that it is not good for sibling relationships to get damaged this early over something none of us have an idea about how it will play out in the future. You need to be clear with your dad and your stepmom- its time for them to change tactics.  1. They need to go to therapy too. Wild that the therapist didn\u2019t ask them to come in separately and make them see that they have a bigger role to play here than keep on hoping and insisting you change your mind- they are the adults and need to get some grip on reality. \n2. 100% you need therapy alone. Ask for it point blank- say you need to talk through the communication part of it to break a stalemate. You should tell your therapist too.\n3. In your private therapy, ask for tools to draw a boundary and expressing the need to break a vicious chain of back and forth. Adults can be really hopeful kids will see the light if prodded enough, so to get out of that trap, you need help to explain in rational terms how your mental health as well as that of your young sister is actually more important, the constant pressure is only making matters worse, and a respite is needed. Things need to flow naturally, and most importantly as teenagers both y\u2019all need to get the hell out of these discussions quickly, because you don\u2019t want your relationship with your sister damaged to the point of no repair. TLDR - you need a break. Your sister does too. And the time out will have to be as long as you want. Dad needs to see it, your stepmom needs to talk to your sister to make her see it, and your therapist needs to help you explain this to dad and stepmom to realize it.", "That has been brought up but it goes nowhere really.

Your evaluation of this being your sisters issue is correct. Her feelings of security are her job to work on, not your responsibility. Honoring your decision needs to be modeled by your father and stepmother because as long as they attempt to sway you towards adoption, your little sister will believe she has the right to ask it of you. Talk to your dad and stepmother about the need for them to support and honor your choice, and finally put it to rest. If they model acceptance, it will help your sister and you. It's their job to do the right thing.", "NTA but sounds like a session with you and your dad may help, then sister who actually has the issues can continue going to understand why she\u2019s in the wrong.", "14 is young enough I suspect the younger sister, especially if she's the favorite in other ways, is being her parents' flying monkey on this."]}
