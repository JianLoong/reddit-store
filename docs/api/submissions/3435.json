We were close when she was little and then our mom died and our dad remarried. My sister adores dad's wife and called her mom from almost the beginning and then she later adopted her. Dad's wife wanted to adopt me too but I didn't want to be adopted and I was never in the mindset that she was now my mom. I was 9 when she and dad married and my sister was 6.\n\nMy sister has always been bothered by my not calling dad's wife mom and by turning down the adoption. She corrects me when I say stepmother or dad's wife and I correct her if she says our mom (I don't correct her when she says my mom when talking about their relationship). It has caused many problems. My dad put me into therapy and tried to find some reason for me to say no to the adoption, saying it was a good thing to have happen. He also wanted me to drop the step occasionally where I never considered her my mom and I was go as far as saying I don't count her in terms of my parents. My dad's wife has made it clear she would love to adopt me still and wants me to consider it.\n\nMy relationship with my sister has gone to hell. We argue a lot. She's hurt I reject our stepmother as my mom. I hate the way she expects me to call stepmom *mom* and allow her to adopt me. I started to avoid her because of the arguing. She started telling everyone who would listen that I was wrong. Dad got us therapy together when I declared in the middle of her correcting me and saying how wrong I am that I could not wait to move out because I won't have to deal with this shit.\n\nWe're on our second therapist but therapy doesn't help. My sister has talked about how much more secure she would feel if I called our stepmother *mom* and how much it hurts her that I don't love the woman to embraced us and how she feels like we're less siblings because of it. The therapists both tried to help explain it to her to no avail and she's on me worse than before because she has heard my feelings from me. \n\nI said I was done with therapy. I told my dad our relationship might just be a lost cause until she can let it go. He told me I can't stop therapy and I would be an asshole to stop when it's important for our family.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669641974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6wjkw/aita_for_saying_i_wont_go_to_therapy_anymore/", "score": 564, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She does not validate your feelings, sounds to me like she needs the therapy more than you do, BUT it's just not helping her.  Yeah, she's a lost cause & I do not blame you one bit for wanting to move out of there as soon as you possibly can.  A sister who is not willing to meet you somewhere in the middle, a dad who is forcing you to go to therapy, & a stepmom whom you obviously don't see as your mom cannot make for a happy home life.

If I were you, I would ask for a few private sessions to sort out a healthy way to deal with your sister's behavior though. As an adopted child who married an adopted child and has a lot of friends who were adopted children, I understand a whole gamut of responses to adoptions. The obsession your sister has about you referring to your stepmom as your stepmom isn't uncommon. Lots of adopted kids are insecure about their relationships and wind up with serious relationship problems because of it. Your sister needs private sessions to deal with her emotional baggage.\n\nI would also during the private sessions ask your therapist to explain to your dad that group sessions are creating resentment that is counterproductive to your mental health.", "NTA. Your sister needs therapy for sure though. She's projecting her own hurt about losing her mamma onto you. If you accept a new mom, then she can ignore the old one.

Your family needs therapy until everyone realizes and accepts that both of your feelings are valid. Neither one of you needs to correct the other when addressing your stepmother.

If they drop it, your sister might drop it if she feels like her stepmom is okay with it.", "NAH. You are at peace with your decision to NOT threat your stepmom as your new mom. It's your decision. And it's a valid one.\n\nI hope your sister continues therapy tho. It seems like all her behaviours roots from insecurities after the traumatic event of losing her birth mom.

Therapy will never work if you're dragged along to it, and outside of court mandated therapy it is unethical to insist someone complete a series of sessions.\n\nYour family want you to continue because it brings them peace of mind, but at the same time you're allowed to have your reservations. If your sister wants to sort out how she feels still she can talk it through without you having to do group therapy - she can reflect on how all this sits with her with one-on-one sessions and work towards coping with the fact you don't want to examine this issue further as it currently sits.\n\nJust keep an open mind that just because therapy isn't for you right now, that doesn't mean you'll never need to talk through this tricky issue again. In fact, your family should also try to understand that your feelings now don't define the rest of your life on this particular topic.

You can't be someone else. When she realizes that, you can be siblings again, but until then her sibling is someone who is not you. Your parents don't get a say in this. You're not an asshole for being you, or for recognizing this therapy is not healing your bond.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to have your own feelings and views on your stepmother. This problem is your sister\u2019s problem and it\u2019s her that needs therapy not you. You\u2019ll be 18 soon and can stop therapy at that point.", "NTA. The only established use case for therapy is to enable assholes to feel better about themselves. It's not for coercing new patterns of behaviour.", "I do wonder if this is the reason they changed therapists already. If the dad is going in with the agenda that therapy is about getting OP to change his mind, but the therapists see that it needs to be about getting everyone comfortable with the reality that it is ok that OP and his sister want different things from the relationship with the stepmom/mom.\n\nNTA", "I would say both are entitled to their own feelings, but sister is wrong to try to make OP bend to her wishes. OP is not trying to get sister to stop calling stepmom mom.", "It sounds like the sister is trying to build this fantasy that she didn\u2019t lose her mom and step mom is her only mom and it\u2019s one big happy family where nothing bad happened. \nAnd every time OP calls her \u201cstep mom\u201d or correct sister, it puts a crack in sister\u2019s facade. INO, sis needs the therapy.", ">  how much it hurts her that I don't love the woman to embraced us \n\nI don't think it's that at all. The way I read it, OP's sister loves that this woman has embraced them and wants to make certain choices to recognize that. To OP's sister, it's an insult to the relationship to not want to make certain choices and it seems like a rejection when OP doesn't want that.\n\nTo OP, it feels like making those choices would be an insult to their late mother's memory, though seems to be ok with his sister making those choices for herself.", "He\u2019s not a \u201cpigheaded teen\u201d because he doesn\u2019t want \u201canother mom,\u201d and you wishing you had what he has doesn\u2019t mean he has to want it. What you wish you had is not his responsibility. This is a terrible take, and the entire reason he\u2019s making this post to begin with - his family is upset that he doesn\u2019t want what they want.", "Because their idea of progress is that you suddenly embrace step-mom. Has your therapist discussed with him what outcomes he should actually be expecting? That using therapy as a tool to manipulate you is not ok or even ethical?", "NTA at all. You and your sister were in very different places when your dad re-married. Your sister was 6 and felt like she needed a mommy and probably had very limited memories or your real mom. You were 9 and had more memories of your mom and were understandably more resistant to the idea of someone \u201creplacing\u201d her. As someone who became a stepmother when the child was 9, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect a child that age to just full on accept you as their new mommy and run with this new family. It\u2019s much healthier for the child if the stepparent is introduced as New Adult in Your Life, and you are allowed to let that relationship develop in a way that feels natural for you; forcing the issues of calling a stepparent Mom and adoption are always a recipe for disaster. \n\nThat said\u2026 allowing your stepmom to legally adopt you will give both her and you legal benefits that you are probably not even thinking about at 17. You\u2019re not a kid anymore, so it might be time to have an adult conversation with your family about WHY adoption is so important to them. If it\u2019s for legal protection, you may want to consider it. If it\u2019s just so that everyone can pretend to be One Big Happy Family, feel free to stand your ground.", "I'm sorry but no. She's had 2 therapist explain to her that her demands about how OP relates to stepmom are not ok. She knows this, she just doesn't care. Her behavior is not rooted in ignorance and 14 is more than old enough to know that you don't get to browbeat someone into changing their behavior to suit you.  \n\n\nIt seems like there are a lot of deep seated issues here by the family has decided to make OP the scapegoat instead of addressing those problems. Until they are willing to reflect on their own issues, grey rock is going to be her best friend.", "\\*chalk not chock\n\n>I'd also ask her how she would feel if you constantly \"corrected\" her by saying, \"she's not your mom. Your mom passed away\". It would hurt...a lot. So if she realises that from you would hurt her, she should realise how what she says affects you.\n\n\\^ this is terrible to say to OP. OP has to deal with both the loss of his mother, then his family members trying to push a replacement into his life, and you try to make HIM feel guilty about how his stepmother feels?", "He is 17. His dad remarried when he was 10. The loss of his mother, though he'll carry it the rest of his life, is in no way a new or fresh loss. \n\nI lost my dad when I was 10 and my brother was 6. I remember my dad, my brother does not. \n\nI respectfully disagree. My comment came from a place of empathy. If the sister had empathy for how it would feel if her brother spoke that way to her, she would not be so quick to speak that way to Op.", "Nta. She is trying to erase your own mother from your life. She doesn't get to do that. \nIt's fine she has accepted your step mum. But she can't force that on you", "NTA\n\nTherapy isn't a cure all for every dispute or issue. I hate that it's the go-to solution for every emotional problem/issue these days. \"Go to a therapist.\" There's no reason for you to go to a therapist.  You don't consider your step-mom your mom. That's okay. There's nothing wrong with you.\n\nYour sister see her as her mom. That's okay too. There's nothing wrong with that either. \n\nYou both argue about it because you disagree and your disagreement comes from a place of deep emotion. You two will are not going to see eye to eye. Frankly, I think the therapist made the situation worse.  Your parents should have let it be.", "NTA, your family is trying to force bonding rather than respecting that she IS your stepmom. You don\u2019t have to give her that title just because she wants it", "NTA. I say this as a therapist. It sounds like they're not listening to you. You have every right to determine how you refer to them. I understand she wants you to call her mom, but being pushy about it. Trying to continually push the adoption by her, from your sister and dad, is creating a hostile home environment for you. I've seen similar before and it always ended badly. Get your therapist to schedule a family session and they need make it clear it's to HEAR you", "NTA if Dad and stepmom respected you enough to accept your choice them sister would get better as she won\u2019t feel the need to fix the family so dad and stepmom should go therapy as it\u2019s important for the family and it\u2019s their problem to fix not the kids problem\u2026 Good luck with moving out and going LC until they do this", "NTA but I think you should continue to go to therapy. It can be hard but you need to talk to someone about these feelings.", "NTA but continue therapy. I know it seems like a lost cause but maybe the therapist will help them understand.", "It\u2019s possible OP that you will have to save money and make plans to leave them when you turn 18.", "NTA. \n\nSince your therapist is reasonable, go to therapy\u2026 but take a book or something else to do. Let sister talk or yell all she wants, you have already said your piece. Maybe the therapist can help her accept that she can\u2019t forcibly change someone else\u2019s feelings, but until then, hey, if they want to pay to send you to a therapist to read or work on homework or whatever, fine. \n\nYou might ask the therapist or your sister why she feels her bond with her new mother is so fragile that your not calling her \u201cmom\u201d too makes her so anxious. That\u2019s on her, not on you. You can accept her bond with your stepmother but she refuses to accept yours.\n\nOr why she thinks trying to squeeze, guilt, and force someone else will do anything other than drive them away. Why does she think beating you over the head will somehow make you happy and grateful?", "NTA.  This is a tough one and I am afraid that besides dad's best intentions here, all they are doing is driving the older daughter out of their lives.  It's commendable that dad tried therapy but as others have stated, I think it needs to be individual therapy.  You can't force a child to move on from her deceased mother and take in the step-mother as her mother's replacement.  Even if the younger one has fully accepted step-mom - you can't expect both kids to have the same response here.  Trying to force it on the older daughter is wrong and is only hurting things - not helping.", "NTA. Therapy is only beneficial if both sides are hearing each other. She's not willing to hear you at all.", "NTA. Group therapy isn't always great, which is what this sounds like. Individual therapy, if you would like to do it, might be helpful with navigating this situation.", "NTA. Your stepmom can still be regarded as family regardless of what title you give her.", "NAH both points of view are valid and sometimes that leads to conflict like this. Unfortunately there probably isn't a solution.", "I completely agree you are NTA but since you have a therapist who understands and supports you I\u2019d keep going even just to have a safe place to vent your frustration. Also I\u2019d talk to the therapist about talking to your dad and explaining that your sister needs to respect your feelings and let this go. It sounds like you\u2019re respectful of her feelings and don\u2019t criticize her for embracing  your step mother as her mother, she\u2019s old enough to give you the same respect.", "how is it a shame? she is not his mom. there's nothing wrong with how OP feels.", ">Nobody else should be telling you how to feel and make you feel wrong because of it.\n\nYet you did this:\n\n>it's a shame you don't consider her your mom\n\nThere is no shame. She isn't his mother. End of discussion.", "You say \"you should never be told you have to do\" therapy, but that's what OP's Dad did. It's not a \"I'd like you to continue\" but a \"you aren't allowed to stop\". Can you expand why that doesn't make him TA?", "The problem with this strategy is that the parents agree with the sister whether or not the therapist does. They originally put OP in therapy to find out why he would say no to adoption. They added the sister to the therapy because OP said he couldn't wait to be free of her insisting that their stepmom is his mom. The therapy is \"important to their family\" because the dad is still hoping OP will change his mind and he has less than a year left to exert his control over OP and insist on therapy so he's not going to waste it.", "How incredibly condescending to call him a pigheaded teen. He's not being pigheaded at all.", "The dad won't let OP stop therapy despite the fact that there is no progress to be made at this point with their continued joint therapy. OP should not be forced to constantly justify his feelings and that's what is happening. That's why the Dad is TA.", "she lost her mom when she was only 6, yes, but she is 14 now. she can understand now, she just chooses not to.", "What kind of progress is your dad hoping for? Is he hoping that therapy will change your mind, or is he hoping that therapy will help you and your sister respect each other\u2019s choices and re-establish a relationship? Because if his view of \u201cmaking progress\u201d is you being okay with calling your stepmother mom, that\u2019s not going to happen and he\u2019s not being realistic."]}
