A little over a month ago, our other dog (beagle) passed away and we have been struggling with his loss. My gf had him since she was 9 years old and he was the center of our world. Our lives have really been turned upside down.\n\nEarlier this spring, we signed a new lease for an apartment that we picked solely for our dogs; more space, green neighborhood, cozier feel. We get the keys on August 1, and are now dreading the move since our beloved beagle will not be there to experience it, and we will be leaving the last place he was alive and where we made so many memories. \n\nMy gf and I are both emotional at the thought of our upcoming move and expect it to be a tough time. This weekend we texted our families saying we don\u2019t want them coming from out of town to help us move, as we\u2019ve already hired movers and feel like we will have a tough time emotionally with the move. \n\nOur parents are understanding and seemingly accepted our wish for no visitors or help at this time. \n\nMy sister (28f) and her bf (28m) are wanting to visit our city to attend a baseball game. She\u2019s been texting me about possible games and weekends to visit. They prefer to come to a game that is the first weekend we will be in our new apartment (and only 2 days after we officially move in). \n\nIf they were to stay with us, we\u2019d have to set up a space for them to sleep among everything else we will be juggling with the move. We also have to drop off our keys and do a final walkthrough of our current apartment on the same day of the game they want to attend. Our current dog can be anxious in new environments and we don\u2019t want to leave him at the new place alone right away. Plus, while we unpack everything, we don\u2019t want more things in the way or the pressure of having to entertain guests.\n\nI\u2019ve told my sister that I don\u2019t think its a good time to visit and sent other weekend game options for late Aug/Sept once my gf and I are more settled in the new place. My sister is adamant that they want to attend the game on Aug 5.\n\nShe\u2019s said they can stay in a hotel, but I worry she might be mad if I agree in the suggestion that they stay in a hotel rather than the free stay at our place. \n\n\nAITA for not inviting them to stay with us?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Regardless of that, you are well within your rights to say no simply on the grounds that you don't want guests. As others seem to think you should bend this for family, I'd add that it's not least bit unreasonable to not be ready for company 2 days after a move. Add in the anxious dog, list of moving related things to do that aren't unpack all your stuff, and the grieving of your other dog, man is sister being a pushy AH. You offered later dates that they would be welcome to stay. If they turn that down, it is not your problem. NTA", "She said they can stay in a hotel, go with that and make it clear that you are busy.  NAH", "NAH.  Sounds like they're cool with the hotel.  We visit my wife's sister a couple times a year and get a hotel - it's way lower stress for everyone.  You are under no obligation to offer them a place to stay - and as the traveler I would never even remotely expect it from someone living in an apartment.  Not to mention one where you're in the midst of the move-in process.\n\n(In our case, the trips are to a city where it's easy to get a weekend hotel room at a reasonable price for medium-quality hotels.  I understand certain cities or popular summer travel destinations may make this harder.)", "You will have moved into the place 2 days earlier.\n\nYou will have boxes and still be in the midst of unpacking.\n\nI would not want anyone to come into the space until it was fully unpacked.  \n\nIf the game sis and bf want to see is that weekend, the MUST stay in a hotel.\n\nToo bad if they are mad.  They are insisting on a very inconvenient weekend to visit you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Let her be mad.\u2018don\u2019t let her in.", "NTA.\n\nWell, I might be biased. I strongly dislike having people at home, it makes me uncomfortable. In addition to that, most times, people don't want to stay with you in order to spend time with you or your partner, but to save money. Well, then, I'd rather you spent your money and I was confortable.\n\nI compromised a lot in this with my first bf and his family, who were awful freeloaders, and I'm never doing that again. When I visit my or my partner's family, we go to a hotel, which caused great scandal the first time, but they now appreciate as we are very low-maintenance.\n\nSo... you do you, it's your home, nobody is entitled to your home but you.", "NAH.\n\nYou\u2019re busy and you don\u2019t have any time to host your sister and her boyfriend. Your sister isn\u2019t TA for asking a question, and she\u2019s already said that they can stay at a hotel. Of course if she\u2019s upset about it then you should stand your ground, but it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much of a conflict."]}
