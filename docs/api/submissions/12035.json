It's not really a party, just the family going out for dinner at a restaurant. \n\nThe company I work for recently rebranded, and I just got a company t-shirt yesterday. It's just a blank t-shirt with the company name and logo on the top left. When I got the shirt, I folded it and put it on my dresser and went about my day like normal.\n\nToday, I did some chores and basically kept myself busy until it was time to go. When it was time to get dressed, I walked into my room and saw the folded shirt on my dresser. I put it on, made myself look presentable, and then left to go to the restaurant. During dinner, my dad noticed my shirt and asked about it. That sparked a 10-minute conversation between my dad, my grandparents, and I about my company. \n\nAfter dinner, in the parking lot, my stepbrother (20m) pulled me aside and told me that it was rude to wear my company shirt because I was flaunting my company and trying to make my stepsisters day about me. I tried to tell him that I wasn't trying to flaunt my company or make anything about me, but he wasn't listening. The only reason I wore this shirt is because I saw it first, so I put it on. And, aside from the conversation with my dad and grandparents, nothing else was said about me or my company. \n\nThe rest of the people there heard, and now everyone's arguing.

Your dad really knows how to pick someone. Congrats on the promotion!", "NTA, honestly, would they have said this if you went straight from work in a work uniform?  People seriously look very hard to find something to obscess, argue, get offended about.  Sounds like your \"step-family\" likes to engage in that sort of behavior.  Let it roll off your back.", "Even Freud himself once observed that a cigar is sometimes just a cigar. Your stepbrother has issues.

As long as you didn't have this discussion during the birthday song you are fine. \n\nStepbrother is definitely making mountain out of a molehill.", "NTA.\n\nHer side of the family didn't need to be bothered by this.

Tell your step brother to grow up and if he can't get used to life.

Your stepbrother, who doesn't join the conversation, takes offense at getting excluded and uses the excuse that it's your stepsister's birthday to voice his displeasure.\n\nIt's a dead giveaway that this is not about hijacking your stepsister's birthday dinner when the birthday gal herself is not concerned. Unless you 4 deliberately shut everyone else out, and it doesn't sound like you did, you are not the ones to blame if other people didn't join.

Good God people need to get it through their heads that they are not the protagonist of everyone's story. Your sister should be way more upset that her 21st bday was lame as hell. I fear she is going to have a very hard time in life if this is the kind of thing that bothers her.", "NTA. As you said you only talked about it for 10 minutes and then the subject of the conversation changed.

They should be happy it was a clean one.", "NTA; not absolutely every single conversation at a dinner birthday party needs to centre around the birthday person and the fact that it's their birthday.

And a rebranding event, is usually a crap ton over the year. \n\nSo we have coolers, backbacks, messenger bags, a north face coat, LOTS of drawstring bags,and let's not get started about the water bottles, and  yeti tumblers. And OMG the shirts, from t-shirts, to golf shirts. \n\nI mean, I would tell my kid to take a different water bottle to practice & not the NRA branded one that we got as a participation prize for some clay shoot event. Where we currently live, though, they probably wouldn't notice or care.  Same with the pfizer backpack(that we got from a community event at a hospital), just to avoid \"feedback\" from people & turning it into some sort of statement.\n\nMostly, this sounds like a them problem. Calling you rude & making it into a big fucking deal for wearing clothing that has nothing to do with them, makes them an asshole.

Would your stepbrother have complained if you wore a t-shirt with a fast food logo on it, and it sparked a conversation at dinner about fast food? Is there something about the company you work for that is somehow inherently competitive vs your stepsister? Like did she apply for a job and get rejected or something?

This isn't even an issue. What it boils down to is they're mad because you wore a shirt that caused a few people to speak to you for about 10 minutes.

They need to get tf over themselves.", "NTA, but you're on personal time. why would you wear something company branded? separation between work and real life is best.", "NAH. You weren't intentionally trying to make your stepsister's birthday about you, and it seems like most of the family recognizes that.

Do they do something inhumane?", "NTA, but it\u2019s kinda weird to wear it as a going out shirt, and it\u2019s a little weird not to notice it the girl having a birthday isn\u2019t having the family talk and interact with her that much.\n\nSo NTA, but it\u2019s going to be obvious to people, including step brother, that your behavior is a bit unusual", "YTA\n\nBut for a completely different reason.\n\nIf you are going out for a celebratory dinner, part of that includes dressing appropriately.
