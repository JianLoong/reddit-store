It's not really a party, just the family going out for dinner at a restaurant. \n\nThe company I work for recently rebranded, and I just got a company t-shirt yesterday. It's just a blank t-shirt with the company name and logo on the top left. When I got the shirt, I folded it and put it on my dresser and went about my day like normal.\n\nToday, I did some chores and basically kept myself busy until it was time to go. When it was time to get dressed, I walked into my room and saw the folded shirt on my dresser. I put it on, made myself look presentable, and then left to go to the restaurant. During dinner, my dad noticed my shirt and asked about it. That sparked a 10-minute conversation between my dad, my grandparents, and I about my company. \n\nAfter dinner, in the parking lot, my stepbrother (20m) pulled me aside and told me that it was rude to wear my company shirt because I was flaunting my company and trying to make my stepsisters day about me. I tried to tell him that I wasn't trying to flaunt my company or make anything about me, but he wasn't listening. The only reason I wore this shirt is because I saw it first, so I put it on. And, aside from the conversation with my dad and grandparents, nothing else was said about me or my company. \n\nThe rest of the people there heard, and now everyone's arguing. My dad, grandparents, and stepsister believe me when I say I wasn't trying to make anything about me, but my stepmom and younger stepsister are with my stepbrother and think I was trying to make her day all about me. \n\nI need an outside opinion. \nAITA for wearing my company T-shirt to my stepsisters birthday dinner?", "created_utc": 1678551893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11oo8yk/aita_for_wearing_my_company_tshirt_to_my/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see that causing a stir \ud83e\udd23", "NtA. \n\nYour stepbrother made it an issue, otherwise it would have stayed a 10 minute catch up between you and your dad.", "NTA. Your dad really knows how to pick someone. Congrats on the promotion!", "NTA, honestly, would they have said this if you went straight from work in a work uniform?  People seriously look very hard to find something to obscess, argue, get offended about.  Sounds like your \"step-family\" likes to engage in that sort of behavior.  Let it roll off your back.", "Even Freud himself once observed that a cigar is sometimes just a cigar. Your stepbrother has issues. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou had a conversation with relatives at a birthday party. As long as you didn't have this discussion during the birthday song you are fine. \n\nStepbrother is definitely making mountain out of a molehill.", "NTA.\n\nHer side of the family didn't need to be bothered by this. The only opinion that matters is hers, and she clearly didn't care.", "NTA.\n\nYour step-fam is fucking nuts bro. Obviously just a short story/ snapshot, but it screams narcissism.", "NTA. At 19 , clean shirt's a clean shirt !!", "NTA, your family needs to learn to listen better.", "NTA and its no big deal. What if you worked for Nike and wore a Tshirt that says Nike? Tell your step brother to grow up and if he can't get used to life. Some people make issues out of silly things.", "So to sum up, your adult sister had a birthday, your family had a get-together at a restaurant in celebration, and your shirt sparked a 10-minute conversation between only 4 of the group. Your stepbrother, who doesn't join the conversation, takes offense at getting excluded and uses the excuse that it's your stepsister's birthday to voice his displeasure.\n\nIt's a dead giveaway that this is not about hijacking your stepsister's birthday dinner when the birthday gal herself is not concerned. Unless you 4 deliberately shut everyone else out, and it doesn't sound like you did, you are not the ones to blame if other people didn't join. And didn't they have news to catch up on among themselves?\n\nJust NTA. Everyone else felt excluded, whether rightly or wrongly. It might help to smooth things over to apologize for accidentally excluding them, but that might just be my allergy to conflict speaking.", "NTA it\u2019s really not at all that serious. And you said your step sister is on your side, so why are they fighting this pointless battle for her? If she cared she would have spoken up.", "NTA Wow. Your company must be cool & your angry stepfamily members must be incredibly jealous of you, your achievements, and your job. I\u2019m glad the birthday celebrant wasn\u2019t bothered, and everyone else needs to get over themselves.", "Dear God\u2026 what is wrong with people? NTA. Can no one else have a conversation because it\u2019s one person\u2019s birthday? Was everyone supposed to stare raptly at the birthday person all evening??? Grown ass adults wanting to be treated like Louis XIV at Versailles because it\u2019s their birthday need to do what the turning of the calendar is showing them and grow the hell up already.", "NTA. Good God people need to get it through their heads that they are not the protagonist of everyone's story. Your sister should be way more upset that her 21st bday was lame as hell. I fear she is going to have a very hard time in life if this is the kind of thing that bothers her.", "NTA. As you said you only talked about it for 10 minutes and then the subject of the conversation changed. Sure you talked about many other things during the celebration so why are they obsessed with these 10 minutes? Some jealousy here maybe?", "NTA. A clean shirt that was presentable to wear in public and not against any city ordinances or restaurant dress codes? No issue.", "NTA.  It's just a damn shirt.  They should be happy it was a clean one.", "NTA; not absolutely every single conversation at a dinner birthday party needs to centre around the birthday person and the fact that it's their birthday. Topics to discuss between 6+ people would run out quite quickly in that scenario.\n\nOn top of that, if I've read this correctly, the birthday girl didn't have any problems with this.", "NTA\n\nIts a shirt, not a statement.  \n\nA good chunk of our everyday useful items in our house is spiff.  Like A LOT.  We're old, and the companies and clients we've worked with for give out shit for weird things.  And a rebranding event, is usually a crap ton over the year. \n\nSo we have coolers, backbacks, messenger bags, a north face coat, LOTS of drawstring bags,and let's not get started about the water bottles, and  yeti tumblers. And OMG the shirts, from t-shirts, to golf shirts. \n\nI mean, I would tell my kid to take a different water bottle to practice & not the NRA branded one that we got as a participation prize for some clay shoot event. Where we currently live, though, they probably wouldn't notice or care.  Same with the pfizer backpack(that we got from a community event at a hospital), just to avoid \"feedback\" from people & turning it into some sort of statement.\n\nMostly, this sounds like a them problem. Calling you rude & making it into a big fucking deal for wearing clothing that has nothing to do with them, makes them an asshole. Like, if they hadn't make a stink about it, a short convo wouldn't even made it into a core memory.  Jeezus.", "What a bizarre complaint. Would your stepbrother have complained if you wore a t-shirt with a fast food logo on it, and it sparked a conversation at dinner about fast food? Is there something about the company you work for that is somehow inherently competitive vs your stepsister? Like did she apply for a job and get rejected or something? Or (ugh) is any conversation that is not explicitly about your stepsister simply not allowed on her birthday? Raging narcissistic vibes here. NTA.", "NTA- I can\u2019t believe how many of these posts involve people whining that people plotted to steal attention on their big day. Who thinks like that - literally almost no one. You are totally good - and everyone knows most 19M don\u2019t think much about their wardrobe choices and most often just grab something. This wasn\u2019t a wedding - and I assume you were appropriately dressed for the type of restaurant. Don\u2019t give it another thought. They are just jealous.", "NTA...please explain how wearing a shirt with a logo on it makes an event \"all about you\"? I really don't get it.\n\nThere are logos on many items of clothing...what's the big deal?\n\nDoes stepbrother dislike you and was trying to get back at you? Sounds like most of the step relations, don't care about your side of the family.\n\nA ridiculous situation to be angry about. Maybe this gives you an out to avoid dealing with these strange and bizarre people in the future.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nGood grief", "INFO : How  (well?) dressed were the others ?", "NTA --- Whats the difference between you wearing your company t-shirt or somebody that has a nike/Adidas/puma/old navy/abercrombie&fitch or whatever symbol emblazed across the front/back top left or right?.", "NTA. This isn't even an issue. What it boils down to is they're mad because you wore a shirt that caused a few people to speak to you for about 10 minutes. If that causes drama with these people I'd hate to see what happens when there's a real issue. They need to get tf over themselves.", "NTA, but you're on personal time. why would you wear something company branded? separation between work and real life is best.", "NAH. You weren't intentionally trying to make your stepsister's birthday about you, and it seems like most of the family recognizes that. It's understandable that your stepbrother may have interpreted it that way, but it's also important to listen to your explanation and understand that it wasn't your intention. It's a minor issue that should be able to be resolved with some communication and understanding.", "Info - Is it a highly controversial company? Do they do something inhumane?", "NTA, but it\u2019s kinda weird to wear it as a going out shirt, and it\u2019s a little weird not to notice it the girl having a birthday isn\u2019t having the family talk and interact with her that much.\n\nSo NTA, but it\u2019s going to be obvious to people, including step brother, that your behavior is a bit unusual", "YTA\n\nBut for a completely different reason.\n\nIf you are going out for a celebratory dinner, part of that includes dressing appropriately. Turning up in a company branded shirt implies you don't really care about the event, and are just turning up straight from work - you don't even care enough to put on a non-work shirt first.\n\nOf course there is a range - if you are going to a Michelin starred restaurant you had better be dressed appropriately, if you are going to Denny's straight from work there is more leeway...", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
