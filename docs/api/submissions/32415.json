{"id": 32415, "submission_id": "18bkzya", "title": "AITA for refusing to get dressed so MIL could come over?", "selftext": "I'm 7 weeks PP. So, MIL started being really invasive in my last month of pregnancy. Started coming over constantly, uninvited. And it was always the most inconvenient of times as well. Everytime I was trying to catch up on sleep and the second that I would start dozing off, she would be at my door. Never failed. I stopped answering the door for her- just to have my husband blow up my phone and say to open the door because his mom was there. Then I went in to false labor and she showed up at the hospital expecting me to let her in the delivery room? Never asked us or anything. She literally showed up during a cervical check and sat down with my husband and put her hand on his leg and said \"I'm just here to hold my baby up\". The nurses were frazzled because she literally just walked in like she owned the place (it was 3am so they were short staffed and didn't see her walk in to the ward). \n\nAnyways, I've had a bad taste in my mouth since then. She was told several times that she was being overbearing and she would stop for a bit and start back up again when it was \"forgotten\". But after I had the baby, she was showing up easily 3x a week. I didn't say anything originally because my husband was super anxious and the added support was nice for him- despite being inconvenient and irritating to me. Especially given that she has no interest in the baby- but has invited people over here to see the baby without asking (she showed up here with my SIL and my SILs 2 kids when I was a week PP and didn't ask or anything). It's irritating and 2 weeks ago I finally snapped. I said she needs to stay away for the foreseeable future because I'm tired of her inviting herself in to my home and taking up space. She's held the baby twice in the 30+ times she's been here. She doesn't help us with anything. My husband told her to stay away for awhile because I needed space. But last night around 6pm she randomly shows up at our door. I had just gotten out of the shower and was hanging out nude in my living room, nursing the baby. My husband asked me to get dressed so he could just let her in for a minute and I said absolutely not. I didn't invite her here. He could go outdoors if he wanted but I'm not getting dressed so she can come in after showing up uninvited. (She said she spoke to my husband and he told me she had but he didn't give her a \"yes\" on coming over. He told her he would talk to me about it and she just showed up 2 hours later.) He says I'm pushing away his mom for no good reason. I argue that I was forced in to this by overbearing and disrespectful behavior. I say since she doesn't respect me or the baby, she doesn't need to be here right now. He's saying \"it's my kid too, I should have a say in who's here\".\n\nETA: I did post in a comment, as it was asked. But no, husband is 100% spineless when it comes to his mother because she inflicted strong abandonment issues in to him and now he's just happy to have her back in his life. She gave custody of him to her oldest daughter (who was 22 at the time) when he was 6 because she wanted to go live with her new BF, who was kid free. From the time he was 6 until he was 17, she only saw him on Thanksgiving and Christmas because she moved to Canada with this BF. Her and her BF split up when he was 18 and she moved back to New Hampshire and was actively apart of his life again. He was still living with his sister when I met him, at age 21 and we moved in together. We have been together for 6 years. She was only coming over to see us maybe 3 times a year prior to the last month of my pregnancy, when she felt it was necessary to be at our place every other day or every 2 days.", "created_utc": 1701806936, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bkzya/aita_for_refusing_to_get_dressed_so_mil_could/", "score": 431, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then I went in to false labor and she showed up at the hospital expecting me to let her in the delivery room? Never asked us or anything. She literally showed up during a cervical check and sat down with my husband and put her hand on his leg and said \"I'm just here to hold my baby up\". The nurses were frazzled because she literally just walked in like she owned the place (it was 3am so they were short staffed and didn't see her walk in to the ward). \n\nAnyways, I've had a bad taste in my mouth since then. She was told several times that she was being overbearing and she would stop for a bit and start back up again when it was \"forgotten\". But after I had the baby, she was showing up easily 3x a week. I didn't say anything originally because this is my husband was super anxious and the added support was nice for him- despite being inconvenient and irritating to me. Especially given that she has no interest in the baby- but has invited people over here to see the baby without asking (she showed up here with my SIL and my SILs 2 kids when I was a week PP and didn't ask or anything). It's irritating and 2 weeks ago I finally snapped. I said she needs to stay away for the foreseeable future because I'm tired of her inviting herself in to my home and taking up space. She's held the baby twice in the 30+ times she's been here. She doesn't help us with anything. My husband told her to stay away for awhile because I needed space. But last night around 6pm she randomly shows up at our door. I had just gotten out of the shower and was hanging out nude in my living room, nursing the baby. My husband asked me to get dressed so he could just let her in for a minute and I said absolutely not. I didn't invite her here. He could go outdoors if he wanted but I'm not getting dressed so she can come in after showing up uninvited. (She said she spoke to my husband and he told me she had but he didn't give her a \"yes\" on coming over. He told her he would talk to me about it and she just showed up 2 hours later.) He says I'm pushing away his mom for no good reason. I argue that I was forced in to this by overbearing and disrespectful behavior. I say since she doesn't respect me or the baby, she doesn't need to be here right now. He's saying \"it's my kid too, I should have a say in who's here\".\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not her showing up for a child she basically threw away only to reenact her past with another child which is know they are there but pretend and act like they don't exist.
