The favoritism is very obvious. A few examples: MIL and FIL are currently six figures in debt for SIL\u2019s college education because they paid for all of her living expenses and the majority of her tuition while DH paid his own way through school. For graduation, SIL was gifted a month-long trip abroad and a $25k car while DH got no trip and a $8k car. After college, DH lived in a closet at a friend\u2019s house for months in a rough area because it was all he could afford while PIL rented a downtown luxury apartment for SIL. When DH and I bought our first home, we worked hard and saved every penny. We were never offered help from PIL, but we didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time because we didn\u2019t need it. Later, when SIL decided she wanted to buy a house, PIL offered to pay for the entire down payment and closing costs because she\u2019s not good at saving money. And every Christmas, we all wait around to watch her open literally twice as many gifts as DH gets. You get the picture. DH never says anything because he\u2019s just grateful for everything he has and he thinks it\u2019s even better to work for it, which I agree with.\n\nDH adores his parents and his sister. He goes above and beyond to help them around their house with anything they ask for at a moment\u2019s notice. We spend nearly every weekend with them. We even allowed SIL to live with us rent-free for almost a year after her ex kicked her out of his house until she bought her own. It kinda makes me sad to see how much he goes out of his way to do everything for them. \n\nIt really isn\u2019t my business or my family, so I didn\u2019t think too much of it at first. What really affects me, though, is how everything revolves around SIL. Every family event needs to be planned around SIL\u2019s schedule.

SIL is not married and does not have any children. Normally, she would dictate the schedule on Christmas. And she expects to do the same this year. Since it is hosted in our house, however, and we\u2019re trying to keep up with our baby\u2019s nap and feeding schedule, I think I should be able to schedule things how I want. The problem is looking like an AH if I try to insist on anything that SIL doesn\u2019t want to do. She likes to sleep in late. I want to just tell her to come over whenever she wants, but that we\u2019re starting whenever baby wakes up and everyone else is ready. But I also don\u2019t want to seem like one of those parents who thinks the world should stop for her child. I\u2019m just tired of Christmas revolving around SIL, and I\u2019m ready for a change.

If you've been asked to host Christmas, you are the one in control of the schedule and planning.\n\nHowever, I'd expect to meet a bunch of resistance from both SIL and your in-laws (who at face value of this post are AHs for the treatment of their son). You might find yourself having to make compromises to keep the peace -- at the end of the day, you'll either have to take a stand and have strained relationships with your in-laws or you'll have to suck it up (unfortunately).\n\nPerhaps the grandbaby will trump their daughter in a Christmas miracle.

You're the host, saying when things start is perfect. And her parents might try to show up late too, which means they'll miss out. Oh well. I wouldn't go above and beyond to have a confrontation about it, though. Your feelings here are right, but don't ruin the holiday for everyone by bringing up drama. Be extra apologetic and nice when they complain \"Oh, I'm so *sorry*, the baby can't control when they need to sleep! I thought all the adults knew around what time we intended to start and could work their schedules around it. We did save SIL breakfast and coffee!\" Make sure your parents are there on time, though, because if you're saying 7am and nobody can make it, then you'll def look like the AH. As much as I dislike the sister from your description, I also want to offer that since the baby will need naps, you could always wait to do gifts after a naptime (it's what I did because grandma was still getting breakfast and a ham ready before the nap). EDIT: I guess just really think about if right after waking is best for baby or if you're just using baby as a weapon against the golden child.", "NTA, but you're about to have a massive uphill climb.", "YWNBTA.

When my son was a baby, we did a lazy Christmas morning in our pjs and opened his presents.  Then the family came in then afternoon for appetizers and dinner.  There were some years where they came for a noon or 1pm dinner.\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t invite my parents or siblings over in the morning because I want to relax in my pjs, have my coffee with some donuts so I don\u2019t have to cook breakfast.   But that\u2019s me.  I don\u2019t want to have to be showered and dressed and ready to entertain for brunch on Christmas.  Neither my in-laws or my family moved very fast in the morning, so a morning thing was never in the cards for either family.  Mornings in both families were relaxed, kids opening the presents\u2026\n\nWhile you get to set the schedule in your house, if you set a schedule that works for you but doesn\u2019t work for someone else, that someone else may not come, and you have to be ok with that or come up with a different schedule that works for both of you.\n\nI would suggest that you map out the day and what your baby\u2019s schedule would be, what is you and your husband\u2019s schedule for meals, and when can you expect the family to reasonably attend.  If your sister doesn\u2019t like the schedule and chooses not to attend, what will your parents do, and are you and your husband ok with that?\n\nI personally had holidays where I accommodated everyone\u2019s needs, only to find out they didn\u2019t give a hoot about my needs.  So I started going with the solution of this is my house, my schedule, and if it doesn\u2019t work for you, then you are free to do something else, no harm no foul.  I was ok with people opting out.  \n\nLastly, I am guessing that they want you to host because then it\u2019s you doing the work, but they will want you to keep to their desired schedule.  You and your husband need to discuss this and what you are both in agreement on if they kick up a fuss about the schedule.  If you cave, it will always be their way, until they aren\u2019t around anymore.\n\nFYI - have you and your husband discussed what happens when they run out of money and lose their house and sister has no money??  They will come looking for you guys to bail them out or live with you\u2026 you need eed to be prepared with what your answers will be\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
