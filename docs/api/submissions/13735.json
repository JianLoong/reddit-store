The fact you don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue says a lot about your own lack of insight into this. Being smart or stupid has nothing to do with it. It\u2019s about lack of transparency on this.

I\u2019m not saying your brother isn\u2019t trying to fleece people, but honestly, he really might not be. Before raking him over the coals in front of everyone, did it ever occur to you to have a conversation about it?
