He should put this energy into becoming a 'real' what his heart desires. Pharmacists worked their ass off to gain this title which comes with responsibility; something he does not understand. He's the one that screwed up misleading his GF.", "NTA. He is purposely being deceptive because he got upset when called out on the truth. If it wasn't a big deal then it wouldn't have been a thing when you corrected it.", "NTA\n\nI work in healthcare. In my dept, a technician posing as someone who does my job would have me fuming. This is not some harmless ego issue. \n\nHe\u2019s letting people assume, including patients, that he is a pharmacist. People will assume he has expertise in something he knows nothing about.\n\nAnd he lied to his gf. That\u2019s not good at all. He didn\u2019t ask you to lie for him. Maybe she was confused! A gf should know what her own boyfriend does for a living.", "NTA, he's lying by omission and misleading people. Hopefully his gf believes you and finds an honest partner.", "NTA - the girlfriend has a right to know. If I were her, I would immediately break up with him\u2026 not because of his occupation but because of his lie. If he lied about that, what else has he lied about or what will he lie about in the future? It\u2019s good that you corrected him and made it clear for her.", "Nta He is lying.", "NTA.

As a pharmacist I find this hilarious though because I too tell people \"I work in pharmacy\" but that is because I don't necessarily want them to know I am a pharmacist. \nStrong work u/BlankIndexCard!", "NTA but this his hilarious deception nonetheless. Why not go to pharmaceutical school? Does he not have the grades or something?", "I briefly dated a guy who led me to believe he was studying to be a radiologist (he said he was studying radiology) but he was really just going to be a radiology tech. That was just one thing of many where he said things that were technically true but misleading. The last one for me was when his family asked if he had cleaned his house when we were going to go out there the next day and he told them it was hygienic but there might be a little clutter... he was well on his way to being a hoarder. \n\nIn general, I have found that people who are very careful to stay technically true but misleading in one area will do the same in other areas of their lives. It's deceitful even if it's not outright lies.", "Ok, let's put this in other terms. I work in a library and when I tell people most assume I'm a librarian which I'm not because that requires a Masters degree that I don't have and I nearly always correct people because the job deserves respect. This is about as low stakes as it gets because me not being a librarian doesn't materially change the service I can provide. Contrast that to the fact that he's misleading people deliberately into thinking he has a pharmacy DOCTORATE because that's what a pharmacist is; a doctor in a highly specialized capacity, and what he's doing isn't just assholishly dishonest, it's potentially dangerous.\n\nHonestly, I don't know why he would ever risk doing something so stupid considering if he ever accidentally gave information that could be misconstrued as medical he could be held legally liable. If he wants to be a pharmacist so badly then he needs to get the fucking degree and have some respect for the profession.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It doesn\u2019t actually sound like he\u2019s being shady, it sounds like you are obsessed with making sure everyone knows he\u2019s not a pharmacist. \u2018I work in a pharmacy\u2019 does not actually make it sound like he\u2019s a pharmacist, and saying \u2018let\u2019s find out\u2019 is a totally reasonable response to a question. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be happy unless he got a tattoo on his face that said \u2018I\u2019m not a pharmacist\u2019.\n\nSo the real question is, what\u2019s going on in your own life that makes you obsessively need to denigrate your brother?", "YTA. You sound more interested in putting down your brothers career than anything else. You clearly don't respect what he does for work. Him saying \"I work in pharmacy\" isn't the same thing as saying he's a pharmacist. \n\nFor all you know he carries his pharmacy on his back throughout his shift. Being a retail tech was one of the most stressful/overworked jobs I ever had. And I was an infantryman \ud83d\ude02.", "ESH. I mostly see your point. I work in education and if an assistant teacher said they were a teacher when asked I might bat an eye at it because it's a very different job with different levels of required experience and education. But in a group of people who don't work in education, I don't think anyone would care too much about the distinction. Regardless, it's definitely not your buisness or your problem.", "YTA it doesn't sound like he's intentionally misleading anyone. It sounds like he's tired of explaining the difference to every single person who assumes everyone in a pharmacy is a pharmacist. Just leave him alone and mind your own business.", "Really why do you care what he says? This seems Petty YTA.", "YTA. Petty much?", "ESH.", "So, he's not doing anything illegal in his work.\n\nIsn't saying that he IS a pharmacist.\n\nNot ideal to mislead by omission but not actually his doing....\n\nYou knew this was an issue, so purposely tried to knock him off his leg in front of his girlfriend. Knowing that would cause ructions. It an AH move to do to your brother in that setting.\n\nWith family like you, who needs enemies....", "NTA. I'd have a conversation with him to find out if he needs support becoming a pharmacist.", "Because it\u2019s deceptive to lead people to think you have a career that takes 6 years of education versus a tech that requires just getting the job and being under direct supervision of someone with the degree. It\u2019s equivalent to a nurse aid being dodgy about being a nurse.", "It is shady. \"Let's find out\" should be, 'Let me get the Pharmacist.\" \n\nThe public relies on people representing their credentials correctly.  Look up Pharmacy Technician; training that can be completed in 8 months vs. 6 years for a Pharmacist.", "As a former pharmacy tech, the legal answer to a patients question about a medication is \"Let me get the pharmacist.\" We don't have the degree and license to answer these questions even if Google is right in front of us or we've heard the pharmacist answer the same question a hundred times. You can get fired for this shit.", "So you afraid he\u2019s ego will eventually cause someone damage? From what you said he doesn\u2019t act outside of his expertise( like recommendation of medicine) so is he hurting someone?\n\nI don\u2019t see this more than a white lie", "Huh? He doesn\u2019t attempt to answer the questions, he goes to get the pharmacist. Why would he get fired for not using the words, \u2018the person who will answer your question is the pharmacist?\u2019", "What about a paralegal claiming to be a lawyer? It that also just a harmless white lie?"]}
