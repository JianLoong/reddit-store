However, from my point of view, it feels like youre bullying me and purposfully disrespecting my identity because you dont like it. Why is it that when you dont like something you get a free pass around it, but when i dislike something it feels like i have to fight a war to feel seen? The lesson youre teaching me right now is that I dont deserve to have my boundaries respected, by you or anyone in my life including future partners. Do you want to see me compliant to the point where I'm walked on by everyone like a welcome mat, or would you prefer that I'm able to stand up for myself? Me changing my name legally wasn't this cute fun little quirky thing I did to get under your skin, and you continuing to call me Emily isn't some innocent act schooling me against my small rebellion. I'm hurting, this hurts, and I'm begging you to be kind. In my eyes, you have not been kind to me. You may think it's not a big deal to you, but this is a serious issue to me and I really need you to understand that you're making the situation worse; it feels like you don't care about how awful it makes me feel and Im hoping we can find a compromise.\" \n\n\nReally make sure to focus on \"I\" statements and how you feel.
