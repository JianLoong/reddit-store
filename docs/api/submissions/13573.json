However, from my point of view, it feels like youre bullying me and purposfully disrespecting my identity because you dont like it. Why is it that when you dont like something you get a free pass around it, but when i dislike something it feels like i have to fight a war to feel seen? The lesson youre teaching me right now is that I dont deserve to have my boundaries respected, by you or anyone in my life including future partners. Do you want to see me compliant to the point where I'm walked on by everyone like a welcome mat, or would you prefer that I'm able to stand up for myself? Me changing my name legally wasn't this cute fun little quirky thing I did to get under your skin, and you continuing to call me Emily isn't some innocent act schooling me against my small rebellion. I'm hurting, this hurts, and I'm begging you to be kind. In my eyes, you have not been kind to me. You may think it's not a big deal to you, but this is a serious issue to me and I really need you to understand that you're making the situation worse; it feels like you don't care about how awful it makes me feel and Im hoping we can find a compromise.\" \n\n\nReally make sure to focus on \"I\" statements and how you feel.

She'll bat away everything you say with stupid BS.\n\nYou can break her stubborn will, but it will take commitment, and you probably want to save your energy for projects of your own. But you can tell her that the next time she fails to call you Lake, you'll cut her off for a year.\n\nAnd she will test you, and you cut her off.\n\nShe'll HATE that. But you just keep doing it till she gives up. She will try \"accidentally\" calling you Emily--and you cut her off immediately. Always a year (or more, if the heart so desires).\n\nNo exceptions for weddings or funerals. It's all or nothing.", "\"people make allowances for parents usually\"\n\nYeah, 'cause they had first shot at abusing you, it's conditioning.\n\nNTA", "100% YTA they can call you whatever they like.", "NTA it's telling you went the legal route. Most people using their middle name just use their middle names.", "Nicely put!", "If I were in OP's situation I'd consider not responding to Emily.", "Yeah, how dare she expect her mom to be respectful", "And call your mom by a different name", "OP should start calling her Emily since she loves the name so much", "Parents aren't perfect, theres a lot of generational abuse that we have to acknowledge and work through. My mom didn't understand at the time what she was doing as she was just following her parents example. Without taking steps to communicate, we further enable our parents abusive behavior. This doesn't mean they don't love us, it just means they're bad at being parents.\n\nEdit to say: my father is a shitty human being, and I felt gaslit by everyone when they told me he loves me but just doesn't know how to show it. Come to find out as I'm damn near 30 y/o that he has autism and learned how to behave from the military \u2014 he didn't have a father and went into the navy at 17. A school and basic training is bad now, it was infinitely worse in the 90s. He was an abusive POS, but I understand what my family was trying to tell me all this time. He just doesn't understand exactly, but he's trying to now. However, he didn't start trying until I start communicating to him. Before communicating, he voted for trump, and after communicating he voted Biden because he wanted to make sure his daughter had a better chance for reproductive rights. My dad isn't dumb, he was just taken advantage of as a young adult and doesn't even know that he's perpetuating abuse.", "I would just start calling her by her first name. Since that is her actual given name so probably just stick to the name the mom was given as a child.", "Nope, the mother is the only one who needs to grow up.  Family isn't owed anything they don't earn.  It doesn't matter **why** I call you anything, if you ask me to call you something else and I don't, I'm an asshole.", "Ah so your whole argument fell apart you just still want to be an ass.\n\nNoone is entitled to be a disrespectful little asshole, not even MuMmY dEaReSt"]}
