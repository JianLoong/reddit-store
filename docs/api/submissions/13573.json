That's such a privileged and immature thing to do. You and your boundaries deserve to be respected, but so does the woman that gave birth to you and raised you with unconditional love. I think that your pride and your ego are forcing you to be unconventionally radical when it comes to this, and maybe you should take some time to reflect on if this really is the hill you want to die on. Mom's can be over bearing and maybe you're retaliating in this way due to feeling stifled, but when you pull away this aggressively then she will be sure to match your energy. She doesn't want to lose you, she doesn't want you to not need her, so she's clearly clinging on to the last thing she has of you. If I were in your shoes, I would go a week MAX with LC and then sit her down some early morning for a talk. \n\n\nMaybe start with \"I need you to listen to what I have to say completely before you say something, can you give me some space to be honest with you?\" And then follow up with something like, \"I dont understand your attachment to the name in the same way you dont understand why I hate it. However, from my point of view, it feels like youre bullying me and purposfully disrespecting my identity because you dont like it. Why is it that when you dont like something you get a free pass around it, but when i dislike something it feels like i have to fight a war to feel seen? The lesson youre teaching me right now is that I dont deserve to have my boundaries respected, by you or anyone in my life including future partners. Do you want to see me compliant to the point where I'm walked on by everyone like a welcome mat, or would you prefer that I'm able to stand up for myself? Me changing my name legally wasn't this cute fun little quirky thing I did to get under your skin, and you continuing to call me Emily isn't some innocent act schooling me against my small rebellion. I'm hurting, this hurts, and I'm begging you to be kind. In my eyes, you have not been kind to me. You may think it's not a big deal to you, but this is a serious issue to me and I really need you to understand that you're making the situation worse; it feels like you don't care about how awful it makes me feel and Im hoping we can find a compromise.\" \n\n\nReally make sure to focus on \"I\" statements and how you feel. Don't be accusatory, and don't angry. Every time she says something that sparks anger in you, take a deep breath and try to communicate your understanding of the situation.
