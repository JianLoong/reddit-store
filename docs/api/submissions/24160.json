I argued back and told him he needed to get a job, which he quickly shut down with something about abolishing the government, and living freely.

I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d feel guilty. You\u2019re doing him a favor. He\u2019s had two years to get his act together. Why would you think that he\u2019ll start now? Infantilizing him until he\u2019s 40 hurts him. Let him find his way in this world. Don\u2019t let him back into your house until he\u2019s kept a job for 6 months.", "NTA- your son needs a wake up call, kicking him out put him on the path to find it.  Once his needs are not being met by someone else and he can no longer coast through life he will realise that he has to work and what an opportunity he has wasted\u2026", "NTA. Not only are you helping yourself but you're also teaching your son not to become a self assertive leech.", "Everyone here is gonna call you an asshole. But, I think everyone needs to live on their own anyway to understand what the world is like. You're there to help him when he fails, not support him for not wanting to better himself in life. I chose to move out early and I'm glad I did as I look at the people my age (mid 30s) and still living with their parents acting like children. \"let me ask my mom first\" should not be something a person that's cresting onto 40 should say on a regular basis.", "Damn the Man, Damn the Government!!\n\nIf he wants to live the hippie lifestyle, and meditate on crystals and patchouli, then he can sleep in his car and beg for coins on Haight - Ashbury like the rest of the hippies did in the sixties.\n\nHes gonna find out reall quick that lifestyle is only great once you have money and a home to live it.\n\nI pretty much live the peace and love life.  My home is my paradise, i can meditate in my garden and be at peace with nature.  But im not gonna sleep in the dirt and roll around in mud at a music festival.  Most people i know now from the sixties have beautiful homes,  and possessions, drive nice cars and worked for what they have.\n\nhe can pitch a tent in the back yad and worship his rocks by the tin can fire place until he realizes what it takes to be a full on adult.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA  NTA", "Entitlement is ugly.

Be grateful he's gone.", "NTA- It's like those clips where you see young adults stating they didn't ask to be born and shouldn't be expected to pay to live. Your son can want to live however he wants but shouldn't expect other to keep paying his way in life. You're not going to live forever and should be able to save for retirement and not have a full grown adult living life free in your house. Nobody asked to be born but non the less here we are working to pay bills, food and to get by.", "Your son is spending too much time online absorbing all the batshit crazy crap....don't feel guilty NTA", "NTA;\n\nbut you have to stick to your guns. Don\u2019t expect him,to come back, and to be fair, it is better if he doesn\u2019t. Families have dynamics that are hard to break. Look at me, a 40something woman with a strong career, extremely independant and shit bit as soon at I go back to my mother\u2019s place, I become her child once again and she does the whole helicopter parent thing all over again. It\u2019s terrible for both of us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyour son needs to become an adult, but he needs to do it for himself and not only to appease you. Let him be responsible of his own live-ing, happiness and hygiene. He will learn.", "NTA,\n\nThat said, I am wondering how much of this \"hippie\" is geniune belief and how much is depression being masked by something political/cultural. \n\nHe sounds like needs help and he is using jargon and idealism to cover for himself or hide whats actually going on.", "No matter what you do, he's going to make his own shitty choices.", "NTA. If he wants to live that free life without the government, that's fine. Except while he was living in your house that isn't what he was doing. What he was doing was *freeloading* and having you interact with the \"government\" and \"negative energy\" on his behalf.\n\nA massive part of the communal and off grid lifestyle is cooperation. Everyone has to do their part or everyone fails. Your son couldn't even do *basic chores* without acting like you were oppressing him. He's not going to function if he has to do actual labour to be able to feed himself. And he won't learn while you're allowing him to be sheltered from reality.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA - Your son was planning on mooching off of you and you taking it.\n\nGood for you, he has no ambition and he'll find out soon enough when his friends get tired of him mooching off of them and kick him out.", "NTA. However, you probably will not hear from him for awhile.", "NTA. Sometimes doing the right thing, it doesn't make us feel good. Well done for being strong enough to do good, to do right. He's just a boy - he'll come around eventually.", "NTA - you're not refusing to care for him at all, you just have reasonable conditions for it.  He has agency here. If he wants to do things on his own terms thats fine but he can do it on his own and it will be good for him.", "NTA. Gotta love those abolish the government types who only want it for themselves, while you still have to work to support his lifestyle.", "Something needed to be done, I agree, but I don't agree that the something should have been kicking him out without a notice. To do things fairly, you should have given him 30 or 60 days of notice to vacate if this is permanent and not just a temporary arrangement to allow feelings to cool down. Kicking him out without a warning places him in a bad, vulnerable position. \n\nI also question how recovered from his depression he actually is if he feels the need to spend most days meditating, but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nSo all in all I think YTA for doing it this way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
