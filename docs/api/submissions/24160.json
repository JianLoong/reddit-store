Everyone has to do their part or everyone fails. Your son couldn't even do *basic chores* without acting like you were oppressing him.

Things are a lot different for young people these days. Full time jobs don\u2019t pay the bills anymore. College puts us in massive debt and doesn\u2019t guarantee a good job anymore.

Sitting in your room at 20 and doing \"crystal healing\" and \"meditation\" is not the real world. There is a time and place for that and the time and place is not ALL DAY while neglecting your adult responsibilities. It's a hard does of what the real world is because his friends will not tolerate it either. Do NOT feel guilty (easier said than done).

That's entirely fair.\n\nHe may not come back though. If those are his priorities then living in his car or a commune, bartering for what he needs or finding seasonal work, may be better for him. \n\nThere is no one correct lifestyle, and maybe 20 years ago you could argue that it's possible for everybody to find a job they at least don't hate, but modern employment practices are not far off from slavery with extra steps for the young... I can't honestly say he *should* be working. Only that he should pay for what he receives.", "If this was a sudden change in behavior, are you sure there isn't some mental illness going on?", "NTA. It sounds like your son wanted to go from school to retirement. Unfortunately life does not work that way. Hang tough. Be prepared for him to couch surf for quite a while. It is his job to find a job. To learn to live in society. Or go find a commune somewhere and live with like-minded people.", "Where did he get this remarkable attitude? NTA.", "You\u2019re doing the right thing.\n\nHere is the problem for your son: his lifestyle works because of you. He doesn\u2019t need to work because you pay for his food and shelter. However, and I say this with all due respect: you won\u2019t be around forever. You can\u2019t take care of him his whole life. And when you\u2019re gone, *what is he going to do?*\n\nWhat if you let him stay with you and then, when he\u2019s 50, you pass away. Now what does he do? He will be a 50 year old man with no college degree and that hasn\u2019t worked since he was 18. Plus he won\u2019t know *how* to work. He will literally have to figure out how to be an adult at the age of 50.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for you because you love him. But the sad reality is if you keep enabling him, you\u2019re doing him no favors. You\u2019re setting him up for failure.\n\nThink of it this way. You\u2019re the papa bird and he\u2019s the baby bird and you\u2019re in a nest. This is a nest on a tree that is constantly growing. If you push him out now, he may not fly, but and you can still catch him. And worst case, he will survive the fall. But the longer you wait to push him, the further the fall, and the harder it will be for you to catch him if he fails to fly. Plus the further the fall, the less likely he is to survive if you can\u2019t catch him. And if you wait *too long* and you die, the nest will fall apart and he\u2019ll fall anyway, from a height he is guaranteed to not survive, and with no one there to save him.", "NTA.

However your son isn\u2019t turning out to be a hippy. He is turning out to be a bum. He is an adult. If that is what he wants to do, you can\u2019t stop him. But you should not enable him either. \n\nYou tried to teach and guide him but he wouldn\u2019t listen. So let the outside world do it.", "I know quite a few people who were like OPs son when they were teens/early 20s. They skated by with youth, good looks, college vocabulary and everyone being willing to give them a chance because they seemed so sincere. \n\nNow they are in their 30s and 40s and it's a totally different story. Many of them are still in this lifestyle but have become incredibly bitter that it didn't pay off. I guess they were expecting to get rich while working gig jobs. Many of the dudes are nasty misogynists who are furious that being a \"nice hippie\" isn't enough to get them laid anymore. Apparently the women who want a man who showers and has a job are all whores /s. In general they pretend to live this carefree lifestyle (living in their van, camping instead of renting etc) and are morally superior to corporate shills like me, but none of them are actually financially self-sufficient. They ALL rely on family, friends and SOs to pay their way. They make vague promises about how they just need to get this one certificate, or they just need to take one more class, or they just need a new van to live out of and then they'll be capable of paying their own way. And someone that loves them gives them money, eventually the class/cert/van doesn't work out and the \"poor me\" cycle of begging and promises begins again.\n\nIf you can't tell I can't stand it. Live however you want, but you better be able to afford it. Can't stand mooches.", "I'm sure he'd love to live free of the government but still collect UBI if it were available.", "Damn I was wrong about this one. Everyone agrees. Is this a split dimension?! This can't be Reddit =P\n\nOk I changed my mind.... YTA. CUZ ....", "NTA and stop feeling guilty. He wanted to live freely and now he is.  Sometimes tough love is what is required.", "\"with the excuse that there was \"a lot of negative energy there.\"\"\n\n\"something about abolishing the government, and living freely\"\n\n\"some kind of meditation and crystal healing\" And ya'll keeo saying tiktok is not what causes stuff like this.\n\nNTA, your kid just wants to be a freeloader", "NTA but also he could have very real mental health issues that aren\u2019t understood.  Anxiety and depression are crippling things that can exist for reasons you don\u2019t control - and I\u2019m not taking about the anxiety we get from normal stress, I\u2019m talking about the inability to work with others because your brain is constantly telling you to run away and that everyone hates you.  Sounds like he knows something is off but doesn\u2019t know how to get help \u2014 there\u2019s no shame in counseling, therapy, and meds if they help.  \nThere\u2019s a whole category of people that suffer this stuff and don\u2019t understand it. Often family and friends don\u2019t either \u2014 unless they have been through it with loved ones or personally battled it.", "YTA for kicking him out but only doing it to control him! When you kick somebody out the idea is that they leave. But not you, no.... You kicked him out so you can control his behavior. So it sounds like you want him to live with you you just want him to behave the way you want him to when he lives with you. That's ridiculous! No it's not ridiculous that he do chores, or contribute monetarily to the budget but he refuses. So in that case he needs to find somewhere else to live. That's 100% fair! In fact it's really smart because he apparently doesn't understand that in order for him to live freely somebody else has to be chained to a job and bills! So he has a lot of life lessons to learn and the best thing you can do for him is kick him out.\n\nBut you're doing that thing my mom did. She kicked me out at 18 because I started working at a perfume company she didn't approve of. Her whole intention, she admitted later, was that I quit the perfume company and stay living with her. But I heard \"you're kicked out\" so I went about figuring out where to live. We have never recovered from that because her manipulation disgusts me! \n\nHe's a grown man. He'll call to when he's ready. Leave him alone!", "NTA\n\n>told me he would start job searching after a music festival planned a few weeks ahead.\n\nFor real? Why not before?\n\nHe was leeching off his mother, and if you hadn't kicked him out, he would have continued to do so.

He is an adult and making his own decisions about his life.  Let him realize the consequences of his actions.  Don't enable him to continue to think he can live for \"free\", ANYWHERE in this world.  He is delusional if he really believes that.", "NTA\n\nIf your son does get into trouble (jail, drugs, pregnant girlfriend)  \n IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT.  Do not bail him out.\n\nYou gave him 2 years. All you asked was for him to do chores.\n\nHe has a car and a friend to go stay with. \n\nYou did the right thing. If your kid has the wrong ideas and friends, that would be a bad influence on your younger kids still at home. \n\nContact a social worker he can hook up with for services. If he's broke, let him use the public defender (supported by your tax money)\n\nThere is a chance your kid may be using hippie ideology to mask depression but many depressed people try their hardest to be self supporting. He wont get out of his hole unless he can tell the truth to a social worker.

He is old enough to at least starting figuring something out.", "job for 6 months.\n\nThis is a perfect solution. I agree.", "2 years is more than 30 or 60 days.\n\nBetter to force him to grow up at 20 than 30."]}
