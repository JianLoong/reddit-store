{"id": 14108, "submission_id": "12d06je", "title": "AITA for threatening to trespass my neighbor and her kids?", "selftext": "So I (29F) currently live with my parents after separating from my husband. They have a really big, fenced in backyard and I have a small dog. When I get home from picking my daughter up from school, I usually open the back door and let the dog out to use the restroom and play in the yard. I leave the back door open so he can come back in when he\u2019s ready. I opened the back door and let the dog out and left the door open as usual and stayed in the kitchen (the kitchen is where the back door is) to listen for him.\n\nWhile I\u2019m at the sink, I hear voices yelling and screaming. I\u2019m thinking at first that it was my daughter but then I remembered that she was in her room. So I peeped my head outside and I see that there are four little kids standing right at the fence yelling at my dog and throwing toys and rocks at him and he runs inside the house quickly. I walked outside and picked up the toys and tossed them back over the fence and told the kids not to yell and throw things at my dog and to stay off of the fence. I said I would not be giving them their toys back next time and that their parents would have to come and pick them up from me if it happened again. \n\nThe kids go home tell their mom. Later, she stormed up to the front door and beat on it. I answered it and she asked me \u201cAre you the b&@$ who threatened my kids?\u201d Confused, I said that I spoke to some kids earlier who were throwing rocks and toys at my dog while standing at the fence around the backyard but nobody threatened them. She said her kids came home upset that I told them that I wouldn\u2019t give them their toys back and that she would call the cops on me for theft if they lost their stuff in my yard and I refused to give it back. \n\nSo at this point I\u2019m thinking that she\u2019s just gotten the story wrong. I try to explain to her that I never threatened to keep the toys, only that I had told the kids that if they threw stuff over my fence then their parents would have to come and get them. I tried to explain that they were literally aiming at my dog and yelling at him. She gets in my face and says that she didn\u2019t give a you-know-what about my \u201cstupid dog,\u201d that I better not even speak to her kids ever again and that she was giving me my first and only warning. I told her that she had three seconds to get off my front porch before I called the cops and had her trespassed from the property and told her that her kids better not come back to the property either and she needs to be watching her kids instead of letting them roam around the neighborhood unsupervised and terrorizing people\u2019s pets. She backed away and stormed off, calling me every name in the book and flipped the middle finger to me as she was backing away. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680733697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12d06je/aita_for_threatening_to_trespass_my_neighbor_and/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So they\u2019ve been here for around 20 years. I honestly just don\u2019t want to be bothered with the new neighbors and I wasn\u2019t trying to be nasty to anyone even though I was peeved that they were throwing stuff at my dog who was just in the backyard playing and running around and the yard is fenced off. The neighborhood is usually very quiet and everyone has historically gotten along very well.", "There are already a bunch of cameras around the house and yard and the other buildings in the backyard.

Those stupid kids were throwing stuff at the dog, who does that?", "It\u2019s funny that you say that I\u2019m temporary when my parents have lived in this house for over 20 years and my neighbors all know me and my siblings and our kids and the high conflict neighbor literally just moved into the neighborhood.", "Oh no. They were being violent to her dog, and the only response was to return their toys and say the kids would lose them the next time?\nYour perspective is all off here. Definitely NTA.

The OP made a very sensible statement; do that again, and your parents will have to come over to reclaim the toys. \n\nShe wasn't \"parenting other people's kids.\" She was telling the neighborhood brats to not be cruel to her dog for fuck's sake.\n\nAnd her parents weren't there, so they couldn't make any decisions about an incident that was happening right then. \n\nAnd she made no threats against the kids.

You do have a nuclear option ;) if you want to see if they bought the house that is easy enough.   Just Google recent real estate sales and your zip code ;)  \n\nI'm super neighborly and love being helpful.   Touch my animals tho and it's on.", "That's good.  Keep all of the footage in case you need to go to the police.", "Not at all the same thing\u2026. Grow up.", "[removed]", "Yes the stupid kids shouldn't throw things at the dog and the OP's overreaching reaction escalated that to a lasting problem between the OPs parents and their neighbors.", "How do you know what the little kids were doing with the dog? You assume cruelty. That\u2019s on you.", "You told the children you would keep their toys. I get you were trying to establish a rule, but young kids don\u2019t understand 2-3 step instructions.\n\nIn their mind, you threatened them. Your intent is not relevant here.", "1. That is no reason the threaten a child or make them feel threatened. \n\n2. You speak to their adult. Not your kids, not yours to discipline.\n\n3. Don\u2019t leave dog alone in an unfamiliar location.", "Or keep the footage in case you need it later. \n\nReporting as animal abuse would escalate the situation a lot.", "You keep saying \u201cgrow up\u201d but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re understanding what that phrase actually means. \n\nAnyway, I was agreeing with you.", "[removed]", "The post says the kids were throwing toys and rocks at the dog.

No children were threatened\n2. When you see children misbehaving, you stop them. You don't let the misbehavior continue until you can find a parent\n3.

You need to open that.

Just do it.", "Saying you're not going to return the toys is not \"threatening the children.\" \n\nAnd if it made them feel threatened \u2014 good! If they're old enough to torture animals, they're old enough to understand that actions have consequences.", "What am I denying? I never said that I would keep anything. I said that their parents would have to come and pick up the toys from me if it happened again. That\u2019s not keeping anything. It\u2019s literally returning them.", "Are you stupid? You obviously don\u2019t know how to read or just lacking reading comprehension skills. So if you saw kids throwing rocks and toys at your dog you wouldn\u2019t say anything? Ever head of animal abuse?", "These kids are close to and older than my eight year old daughter.", "No, I don't agree. The OP is most definitely not an AH.", "So instead of admitting you didn't read it all, you decide to come up with this comment? Fantastic and kind of sad for you.", "Good to know that you are pro making kids feel threatened.\n\nKnowing that, I don\u2019t care about anything else you say.", "You deny that you threatened.\n\nYou threatened to keep their toys and their only recourse is to get their parents. Kids only understand the first half and your condition for return does nothing to assuage. You are threatening to keep their toys as they here you.", "So maybe younger than too.", "Do you understand children and their ability to understand multi step instructions?\n\nDo you understand children can feel threatened regardless of your intent?\n\nThis is pretty basic stuff.", "Considering the reaction your posts are getting, I'd say no one else cares about anything you say either.", "Okay, if you say so. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd", "It wasn't a threat. She said if they threw them again they would be kept until their parents came to collect them.

End of story.", "Wouldn't bother tbh, they wouldn't see facts if it slapped them on the face.", "That was a good dodge attempt.", "Really, I owe you nothing. You\u2019re over here going totally off the rails just to be contrary and I honestly am too tired, too pregnant, and am in far too much pain to argue with a contrary troll hell bent on trying to push me out of character. Argue with yourself. I gave you all of the information, now you can continue to let your imagination run wild or whatever it is that floats your boat, but I\u2019m not entertaining this conversation anymore. I\u2019ll be off taking my nap. Have a good one."]}
