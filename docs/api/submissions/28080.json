We each had a daughter prior to getting together. My daughter is Amanda (17F) and hers is Daniella (17F). When my wife and I first moved in together, we both decided that each of us would only discipline our respective daughters.\n\nFor the past 5 years, Daniella has been eating a crazy amount of food. She's put on so much weight (200lbs+) that she's borderline obese if not already. I had concerns that she had an eating disorder and suggested to my wife that she put her in therapy because this isn't healthy. However, my wife dismissed my concerns and told me she's a \"growing girl\" who needs to eat. The problem is she was also taking food that didn't belong to her. For example, I once bought a box of protein bars for myself only to find out later they were all gone before I had a chance to eat even one bar. Amanda's best friend gave her a piece of cake to bring home for her birthday and that also disappeared. We later found out that Daniella had eaten them. The girls had so many fights because Daniella was taking food without asking. It got so bad that I had to get Amanda a mini fridge so that she could keep food for herself in her room.\n\nFor the past couple of years, Amanda has been getting interest from boys. Daniella hasn't been getting as much. It's not because she's ugly. She has a pretty face but combined with how unhealthy she is, it's not a surprise she doesn't get asked out often. \n\nDaniella doesn't take it too kindly. She's made a lot of passive aggressive remarks about the boys in her class like how they have \"shit taste in women\" and \"all men are losers\". She's made many comments like that. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to encroach on my wife's boundary but I should have.\n\nAnyway, Amanda has had a crush on a boy for a while now and he recently asked her out. I was in the kitchen making a sandwich when she excitedly told me about it and where they were planning to go. I was obviously delighted for her. Daniella was in the living room watching tv. She overhead us and passed a comment \"boys will go after any chick who opens their legs\". I told her that's not a nice thing to say and asked her to apologize. She replied \"I'm not apologizing to this slut\". I saw Amanda had tears running down her face. I just got so angry. I yelled at Daniella and said it's none of her business who Amanda dates and the only reason she isn't getting dates is because she's fucking fat.\n\nDaniella burst into tears and went to complain to her mom. That started a big argument and I told her she needs to parent her daughter and tell her to keep her nasty remarks to herself. They ended up going to my MIL's house to spend the night. When I talked to my sister, she said I should have handled the situation more delicately since Daniella is still a child and clearly having self-esteem issues. However, I only said what I did to defend my daughter.

What Daniella said was awful and she should be disciplined. More importantly, she should have been getting counseling regarding healthy eating as well as, I suspect, other issues for years.   \n\n\nHer mom is the AH for that. But so are you. Whatever agreement you made to only discipline your own daughters, you have been this child\u2019s stepfather since she was eight years old. You have lived in the same house with her and her disordered eating all that time and all you did was buy Amanda a mini fridge and suggest Daniella get counseling? You owed it to her to step up more in defense of an obviously unhappy child.", "based on this story, everyone is the TA except Amanda (potentially due to bias writing in her favour, but who knows!)\n\nYou body shamed a child, you didn\u2019t defend your daughter.

Your stepdaughter is a seriously unhappy person and needs mental health care. She needs therapy and possibly meds. Obviously you were upset because she said something truly vile to your daughter, but calling her fucking fat was not the way to handle it. \n\nYour wife needs to wake up. If she doesn't, it would be a good idea to separate.", "I'm sorry this is not the way to handle a child. Nasty remarks in reply to nasty remarks is just going to get you into an ugly back and forth. You are an adult, not five years old. Handle the problem like an adult. It's pretty clear your stepdaughter has an ED, potentially binge-eating disorder and needs help. She's being a huge asshole to your daughter, which is unacceptable. Do you know the root of this issue/why the girls would be at odds with each other like this? I doubt this was a random off handed remark. \n\nYou should have talked to her like a kid and tried to get her to understand the hurt her comments caused, rather than lowering yourself to a catty high school level. \n\nYour wife and you also obviously need to learn how to work together as a team. \n\nESH.", "ESH apart from Amanda.\nTo be Frank, the main cause is the fact that you and your wife decided to try and bring your daughters up separately in the same house - this stops you forming a family. I assume you thought this was best for your girls but if you look back it was so you and your wife didn't have to compromise / build a joint family as its really hard work, it's coming back to bite you both now.\nI know you will have thought this best at the time and I can understand this thinking but it just doesn't work. I hope you sort this out with your wife and girls and come to an agreement on how to live together as a family, your daughters relationships will only get worse as they age if you don't! \nGood luck", "ESH\n\nDaniella needs to check herself, but bullying her about her weight was not the right way to go about it, even if she is being abusive to your daughter.\n\nI would have told her that her attitude might be what is holding her back in the romance department, but it sounds like she has some major issues.", "ESH.\n\n>That started a big argument and I told her she needs to parent her daughter and tell her to keep her nasty remarks to herself.

When I talked to my sister, she said I should have handled the situation more delicately since Daniella is still a child and clearly having self-esteem issues. However, I only said what I did to defend my daughter.\n\nYou guys have been together for 9 years and its still \"your daughter\" and \"my daughter\" bullshit.\n\nYou could have defended your daughter without attacking your other daughter.\n\nAt this point the only person who doesn't suck is Amanda, and I'm a little worried it only looks that way because you're the one telling the story.\n\nGod this sounds more like you're FWB who force your kids to live together to make hooking up easier on you both. Wtf kind of family dynamic is this?", "I'm going to have to say ESH here. \n\nDaniella was absolutely out of line. No question about that. \n\n But please don't try to suggest that you needed to insult Daniella in order to defend Amanda.  You did not. You could have kept a cool head and firmly told Daniella why her words were inappropriate and left it at that.", "ESH but first, you're an adult. If your daughters get into name calling arguments, it's not your job to escalate, it's your job to correct it. Calling your stepdaughter, or any woman fat is wrong. Your wife sucks because obviously your stepdaughter is having issues and using food as a crutch, she needs to be going to therapy. No person can gain 200 pounds and still be healthy, and I'm a fat man who could lose 200 lbs and still be overweight. Your step daughter is going through things but even so attacking other  people is not the right action, but she's still a kid and has been coddled so of course she acts like that. \n\nAltogether your household sounds toxic as hell, and as you're a dude, I'm sure you're blind to the many microaggressions that make it unbearable.", "ESH. You are the adult, but you turned into a 17 year old and started name calling. That\u2019s nothing to be proud of. \n\nYour stepdaughter certainly is no angel- lots of hurt which can be carried into adulthood can come from throwing out horrid insults like she did, but this is on your wife for not trying to figure out why her child is turning to food/stealing food for comfort. \n\nEveryone here holds blame (aside from Amanda) and you and your wife\u2019s parenting game needs a whole lot of work.", "Ok so your step daughter is awful, and I cannot imagine someone trying to slut shame my daughter like that. However you are an adult, who has been in her life for more than the half of it. You and your wife's rule might work up to a certain degree, but not like this. You guys let a girl become toxic + you didn't protect your child from this. I do think this is above reddit's paygrade and I withhold my judgement", "ESH your wife is an enabler, D is a mean teenager who needs to be disciplined and educated instead of insulted but man you're an asshole i can tell that you've been waiting to tear her down on her weight based on the way you narrated this whole post", "ESH \nWhy are you still living with the woman who enables a misandrist brat? For staying with this situation and not doing anything to proactively change, TA\n\nDaniella is plenty old enough to not react with jealousy at her sister\u2019s happy news. Also TA.\n\nWife\u2019s not doing anything about this literally growing problem either. Also TA. \n\nYou were ok to tell off the stepdaughter, she gave an insult and got one. But ESH. You might also think about why the stepdaughter feels men are easy to fool when getting laid\u2026. because other than that why is that pair in your life at all?", "ESH - she shouldn\u2019t be saying those comments at all, her attitude is what needs work. YTA for implying it\u2019s because she\u2019s fat and not because of her attitude. Fat girl here and I\u2019ve never had any issues finding boys/men to like me, my dad said the same thing you did and it messed me up good. Like seriously, our relationship is so damaged from how he treated me over my weight to the point I didn\u2019t speak to him for 3 years. \n\nIf you want her to change, you and her mum should have implemented things earlier and showed through actions what a healthy life style is. She\u2019s 17 now and it\u2019s a little too late for that. You and your wife don\u2019t seem to be on the same page, you probably should try and fix that in therapy.", "ESH. She was out of line but you\u2019re an adult and you sure as hell aren\u2019t acting like one.", "ESH, at least,  the adults. Her mother is in denial and you were mean. I hope it serves as a wake-up call but you know it was harsh. And she owes Amanda a huge apology.", "ESH what Daniella said was awful, but you're the adult here. What you said is going to have long reaching consequences for your entire family. I can't believe you retaliated against a teenage girl as a grown man of 44 years. What she said would have infuriated me too, but this was not the answer. If my wife talked to my daughter that way, I'd leave her.", "ESH. Do you think yelling at her, calling her fat, upsetting her, and telling her boys won't like her because she's fat, is going to fix the problem? You should have simply told her to not make such nasty remarks, and left it at that, then went to console your daughter. Your stepdaughter is an AH for saying such rude/nasty remarks, and being a blatant misandrist, and her mom is an AH for allowing her daughter to behave the way she does, and enabling her eating disorder/psychological issues/rude remarks. The only Non AH is your daughter, I feel bad for her, tbh, but the rest of ya'll need some therapy...", "> However, I only said what I did to defend my daughter. \n\nHow is insulting Daniella doing anything to defend Amanda? All you're doing is establishing that you think that this is a normal and correct way to talk to people.\n\nESH, you and your stepdaughter both - but mostly you, because you're the adult in this situation.", "ESH - mostly Daniella, because who tf talks like that, but you for insulting her back - you\u2019re the adult. I would have a serious talk with your wife, though. Does she discipline her when she speaks to your daughter like that? That sort of talk can have long-term psychological effects and is super harmful.", "ESH apart from your daughter. \n\nYou for your lack of tact and diplomacy. You are the adult in the room. \n\nDaniella's mom for not seeing or not accepting that something wasn't right.\n\nDaniella herself for making these insults but not be able to take the heat. Though I can't help but wonder if there isn't some kind of deeper reason for all these issues. Isn't she is suffering under some kind of depression which gives her this huge hunger and lack of self-confidence and therefor these weight gains? Many times, if someone is depressed, they compensate with food. And then the weight gains come in and ruin their self-esteem which worsens the problem. Talk to your wife again and again and bring her to a doctor because my guts tell me there is something fishy below all that.", "ESH\n\nYour wife needs to parent her daughter. You though being the adult should have handled it a little more delicately. I commend you for standing up for your daughter, but you could have sent her to her room and let your wife know. (Well maybe you thought she wouldn\u2019t have done anything since she let her daughter get this way )", "It sounds like how you all talk in general is the problem. Going after her weight was not the appropriate response. Your wife is going to have to step up. And you both will have to rethink the only disciplining the one daughter thing, although it might be a bit too late if they\u2019re already both 17.", "ESH People don't suddenly start eating so much that they gain a massive amount of weight for no reason. Something happened. Possibly something big, possibly something terrible. You and her mother failed Daniella by not even trying to help her. You could have been her friend without being her disciplinarian parent but I doubt you even tried to do that. \n\nInstead, when Daniella made a slut-shaming accusation (not good) to your daughter, you chose to skip the teachable moment and sink to the level of a teenage girl. \n\nYou may not be her parent but you're still an adult. Act like one. \n\nHave you ever sat down with Daniella and asked her WHY she eats the way she does? WHY she thinks all guys are losers? Asked if she wants help with anything, like her diet/nutrition/eating habits (NOT \"go on a diet\" suggestions) or her size? Asked her what that help might look like?  \n\nBoth of your girls need that.\n\nEdited to correct the fact that my brain was on break when I read the daughters' names. I reversed them.

I\u2019d think after 9 years you would both be parenting your daughters together", "ESH - however you're running your household isnt working.\n\nDo you know why most kids suddenly gain weight...sexual assault.\n\nDo you know why most female teens hit the \"all men are losers/I hate all men\" phase? sexual assault.\n\nDid anyone ever check in with this child, instead of being disgusted?

It's a vicious circle that may make it difficult for her to get into a relationship and maybe end up in an abusive relationship because she has self-esteem issues. \n\nSo yes, your wife sucks too here and she SHOULD start parenting her daughter; her first action should be to take her to a psychologist, an endocrinologist and a dietician and get her a complete round health check-up to identify the reason she's so big and what damage it's done to her health.

There is probably so much more going on with this family.", "Hits to the core of why she\u2019s bitter towards men and the underlying issues she\u2019s causing with her step family, stealing food etc? Kinda obvious from how it\u2019s explained.", "Jesus Christ \u2014 that\u2019s a lot for anyone, especially a child!, to deal with. I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t have a supportive & loving parent.", "All children benefit from co-parents but not all people are good parents.", "Ok? I was in COLLEGE at 17!", "Or boot camp.", "You can do the right thing or the wrong thing.     \n     \nWhich ever you choose you can still do it the wrong or right way.     \n     \nOP did the right thing, sticking up for his daughter.

But Reddit seems to judge things in an all-or-nothing style only.", "A 17 year old can sign their life away and join the military. That's adult enough.", "When judging AITA, an asshole action trumps multiple good actions. So even if they do 9/10 things great, 1 asshole move makes them suck.
