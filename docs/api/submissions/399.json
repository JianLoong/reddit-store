The 4 different excuses, the fact that this has happened 5 times\u2026 etc. I\u2019m not sure why you can\u2019t read course material at a library or by yourself, but only you are responsible for your education at the college level.

That\u2019s out of control. Maybe look up an actual tutor to help you? When someone is getting paid they tend to show up on time.", "NTA.\n\nWhat's a \"reading meet\" and how does having another person there help you read?", "NTA. You did them a favour bringing the food, they did not notify you that they would be missing the meeting, and your text was not, to me, complaining. To me, it showed that you were telling them how you expect to be treated, and this text was worded in a way that seems fine to me. Maybe pull back a little if this person isn't showing you the same dedication (like you bringing them food).\n\nIf you need academic help and this person is not reliable, though, don't punish yourself by continuing to seek out meetings with them. See if you can meet with your professor or someone employed by your university (my previous unis have had homework / essay help, and I'm sure they would be helpful for reading) - those people get paid to help you, so they will not flake on you. Best of luck with your exams.", "I gusss. The main reason im behind is because we just resumed from an 8 month strike randomly, while I was working two jobs, and finals are in 4 weeks. The other 4 times were not invites from me, but from others that I happened to be with....I guess she doesn\u2019t feeo comfortable around me, and I can understsnd that much.\n\n>and maybe do some reflection on why this person is making you less of a priority.\n\nI'm not worth much as an individual I guess.", "Im a little behind on material I admit....its kinda why I needed the help.", "They aren't a volunteer and I'm kinda...behind on.my reading, needed them to help me explain a few points for an upcoming test.", "We communicated over text and they said they were hungry after the rain. I offered to buy food for them and they accepted. We set a time and I arrived then.", "I need help covering material", "You need to work on your sense of self worth. It seems that you are martyring yourself here - most people can take the hint of five different excuses and no-showing for hours. A reasonable reaction to someone being an hour late is to go home. You chose to sit in the hot sun for six hours. Do you not appreciate yourself enough to say enough is enough - I'm worth more than this? Or do you enjoy martyring yourself for six hours just so that you can complain about it? Some do enjoy that, you know. Either way, you need to work on yourself and setting boundaries.", "Then ESH", "Texting doesn't seem to be an issue, can you not read on your own and ask any questions you may have via text?\n\nNTA obviously but you have got to find a workaround here.", "So are they an employee? Like you need to put more information in your post and explain the situation better.", "OK, fair enough. I wondered if you (unintentionally) freaked them out, but they knew you were coming over. NTA. They don't respect your time.", "I...I don't get the ESH reasoning here, even though I think its ESH too. I would ve inclined to agree but being behind on material is hardly a reason to be a bad person. And this is the first time I've asked for her help academically, and the 5th time ive asked for her aid in anything in 4 years.", "They reply to my texts every two hours if I'm lucky, and 2 days if I'm not.....", "They are a friend I asked for help. There is no contract going on", "Because you have probably bound your shortcomings on one person. They're arseholey as they agreed and flaked, but if someone routinely flakes, it's time to try something else or find someone/a group that is helpful. Friendships are rarely completely equal, so if you're experiencing bad trades then you need to reign in your offerings if it is causing you pain/distress. It's easy to fall into the fallacy that just because you did something for someone, they will return the favour. From a moral standpoint they *should* but you can't make the world fair by 'morally should'. \n\nFor other study methods, have you tried background noise/music? Pomodoros? Doing some drawing/writing as you read to make it more engaging? \n\nFor me, I can't study for long periods, so frequent short bursts are best for me. If what you're reading is a textbook rather than a story, there's also the option of taking the main headings and seeing if there is a more engaging way to learn the concept. I bore easily so having music does help a lot with doing tasks.", "Okay, well it may be time to consider whether or not this is a fair thing to ask them to do. It sounds like they were trying to do you a favor, and they got sick. So one time you can say that you would like them to communicate a little bit better, but I wouldn't get really mad at them for this or harp on it either. They are already being pretty generous with you.", "Fair enough, Ill try to read up. Why am I being downvoted though lol", "Im not really mad. More just let down. I guess I shouldn't be?", "Ain't me doing the downvoting, but you do partly come off as the 'needy' friend and not accepting that things are what they are. It might be worth reading the geek social fallacies and see if you fall into those. Also possibly some questioning judgement. \n\nIf you're behind to where it will affect your grades, you should talk to your tutor/professors/teachers. They may have resources to help you catch up (I was given a mentor for some of my time at uni) or can signpost you to services if you are having difficulties. If you seem to be struggling more than your peers, you may want to see what mental health services are available to you (how I found out I was on the autistic spectrum, woo, though there were others that were found to have ADHD and dyscalculia).", "I\u2019m down voting you for not taking responsibility for your own schooling. The idea of you sitting at a coffee shop for hours waiting for someone to sit next to you while you read instead of just READING BY YOURSELF is a serious issue. I went to college with people like this and it was overwhelmingly AHs. Can\u2019t stand this behavior. Get a tutor and leave your friends out of it.", "You need to get help from faculty or a professional tutor and not rely on a friend for your ability to perform academically", "I mean it's okay to be bummed out that it happened one time, but you should also probably let it go. Like you would be an asshole if you continued to be upset about this after they apologized.", "I did read by myself though. And I rarely ask for help. Its one of the reasons Im in such a dire situation. Im afraid that anybody I ask will see me as incompetent, and try and cover stuff by myself, only to fail. So I asked a friend for help before it happened again.\n\nNow I'm just thinking it'll happen again. And tutors aren't cheap. Im working two jobs and you think I can just afford one...", "I give. Maybe dropping out isn't such a bad idea.", "I'm not upset really. Just needed to confirm if what I did was wrong.", "Fine, talk to your faculty then? You\u2019re acting like you\u2019re the only person on the planet who has ever worked while attending college. For someone working two jobs HOW did you have time to waste 6 hours waiting for someone?", "I don't think what you did was super wrong, as long as you continue to thank them for their help and treat them with gratitude. Don't take it for granted, and move on, and you should be fine.", "I scheduled the day for reading. And I didnt waste them, I covered some material on my own, justnot as much as I'd have liked.\n\nIm already in academic councelling and I assure you, it's done nothing so far. Now I jist have someone asking me werkly if I've read, I say I have, that's that. The tutor they asigned to me doesn't care, and I honestly don't trust them to rectify the situation.\n\nI'm making excuses at this point us what it seems like, but this is the first time I've asked fo their help reading. I'm not even saying she should drop everything, I'm more just in panic that my last resort didn't show. Still, screw it I guess.", "I will clarify this is yhe first tome in 2 years Ive asked for their help \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04. Just really needed it this time."]}
