{"id": 757, "submission_id": "yjltm7", "title": "AITA for sending other girls these messages while in a relationship", "selftext": "\nMy gf and I have been together since October 8, 2020.\n\nOn November 9th 2020 via snapchat I exchanged the following messages with an ex-friend who was a girl:\n\nEdit 2: I need to note that this girl had a crush on me and had asked me indirectly on a date at this point.\n\n{ MASSIVE CRINGE WARNING }\n\nCONVERSATION 1:\n\nGirl: \\[ Posted on her story: \" I stg if I get one more snap of a guy asking me for pics I'm just gonna simply pass away (star emoji) or be a stripper, IDK yet. they make bank so I mean....... Idk about you but a tit pic a day keeps the doctor away.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: Bro the \"(star emoji) or be a stripper\" had me weak (crying emoji). Sorry about that shit though mad guys are horny asf\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGirl: HAHAHA (3x crying emoji) and it's good, I thought that was funny myself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nme: the star emoji lmao\n\n&#x200B;\n\nher: yesss I needed to put that in there\n\n&#x200B;\n\nme: had me weak\n\n&#x200B;\n\nher: hehehehe\n\n\\-end-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am aware that this exchange is highly inappropriate and to be completely honest I don't know why I sent them or what my motivation was. Girl & and I at this point have been friends for 4+ years so it makes sense that we were able to comfortably have a conversation like this over text. I should also note this was the last time I ever contacted her, the next morning I regretted doing this and just didn't know what to do. I decided it would be for the best if I brushed it under the carpet and never do something like this ever again. I love my girlfriend and I even told her that myself on November 4th, 2020. I didn't want to ruin my new and first-ever relationship because I decided to make an inappropriate message to a friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2 years have almost passed by and I have never contacted \"Girl\" since and don't plan on ever contacting her again. Last night while at the movies with my girlfriend and one of my friends (male) we walked out of the movie and my gf went to call her mom but had to use my phone because hers was dead. She noticed I had 2 cellphone numbers under her mom's name so she called the one she didn't recognize. according to my gf: a girl answered and she sounded around our age and she claimed to not know who you were. I genuinely have no clue how this number got into her contact. however it was discovered by me today that this number was a cellphone number previously used by another one of my friends, I thought maybe when getting my new phone there was some sort of problem when it transferred over my data for the contacts. y girlfriend was rightfully concerned after this happened so I gladly surrendered my phone to her and she proceeded to look through all the messages I have ever sent via message and Snapchat. Now you'd think this is where our story ties in but not yet. the first thing my gf noticed was a message I had sent to a girl who I don't even know. The conversation goes as follows:\n\nCONVERSATION 2: (8/10/2022)\n\nGirl 2: \\[Posted a picture of a car accident she got in on her story\\]\n\nMe: Are you ok?\n\nGirl 2: I'll be okay thanks for checking up\n\n\\-end-\n\nThis was the message that got us into an argument last night. My girlfriend claims this was an inappropriate message to send to a girl I didn't know because I am in a relationship. I responded by defending myself saying it was just because it was a car accident and I just felt like for some reason I should've asked idk why I did. I apologized and she got over it that same night and everything seemed okay.\n\nThis morning, my girlfriend and I hung out and everything seemed to be back to normal and fine until I got out of my class. I leave class after she texted me \"Can you come over after class I want to look through your phone again\"I was slightly confused but agreed. I gave up my phone and she began to search through my messages again and found the messages I displayed at the start of this post.", "created_utc": 1667337813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjltm7/aita_for_sending_other_girls_these_messages_while/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
