Sarcasm is no reason to have a breakdown like that. _At the same time,_ she didn't know you had lost a pet, nor that you had been diagnosed with clinical depression. In today's society, the words \"depressed/depression\" are used so commonly and interchangeably with other words like \"upset\" or \"sad\" and things like that. They aren't used according to their clinical meanings. It's unfortunate, but that's how it is. You can't take that out on her.

Hopefully the classmate understands that OP doesn't like her and stops trying to engage!!", "I mean she's 24, not 14. She should know that being depressed isn't the same thing as being upset or sad and it's not OPs fault she didn't seem to understand that. Especially after the panic attack thing, you'd think she wouldn't just blurt out random things. She should've had more thought over what she was saying.

She's a 24 year old acting like a 14 year old and I feel justified in judging her maturity as I am a couple years younger than her.

You're tense and your heart beat increases. It can be extremely unpleasant but most of the time it's something you can power through. Panic attack makes you feel like you're dying.

Anxiety is a symptom of panic attacks?? What the what\u2026. \n\nSigh. If you have a symptom then that means you have a condition, right? Her symptom is panic attacks. \n\nWhere in the DSM-5 does it list \u201canxiety\u201d as a symptom of \u201cpanic attacks\u201d Answer: nowhere, because \u201cpanic attacks\u201d isn\u2019t the name of a mental disorder.

Anxiety as a symptom of panic attacks? Yeah, no shit that isn't in the DSM. Because it's random word salad you vomited trying to sound smart.", "Awwwwww, this is so pitiful.
