If it was her goal to set her off, it worked. I've worked hard to be more than my depression and anxiety. I'm not letting another person make me look like I can't handle my life without losing my temper. \nYou can let people set you off just like op did if you want, but I refuse to give that power to anyone.", "I mean it\u2019s like when people get the AITA scenarios where they come out the handicap parking and someone comes up and clearly tells them they don\u2019t have a handicap cause they look young. People in return are rude back and it makes the other person cry or be mad. Some people just don\u2019t learn and you have to be rude to make them understand.", "No, you don't have to be rude back. But i get it. I really do. I refuse to become what people think is the stereo type. I've had so many things stolen from me, I refuse to give them the power to make me angry.", "you might want to get ahead of this with the school administration  because she may decide to report you for bullying i have met so many of these types of people in my life so just be ready to expect it", "op=nta\n\nshe had her feefees hurt by being told truths?  Shouldn't she be able to handle them since she's so aware of how mental health works?", "NTA you\u2019re awesome", "NTA", "NTA.\nAnd you didn\u2019t \u201cmake her cry\u201d, she chose to cry, and could as easily have snapped out of it as you can cheer up out of your depression.\n\nI hope you have a better, and easier, rest of time on your program\uff0e", "So this girl is ignorant about mental health, but making a good faith effort to sympathize and connect with you.\n\nBut you're just... mean. Nothing you describe her doing merits your casual cruelty. \n\nHaving depression doesn't excuse being willfully unkind to people. \n\nSo as much as I hate the phrase, \"you need to cheer up,\" her heart was in the right place.

You let out your frustration on her unnecessarily blowing more than a little out of proportion", "YTA. Just because you\u2019re going through something doesn\u2019t give you any right to treat people in the manner you treated her. Yeah the second comment may have came across as a bit snide, but your response was completely unwarranted. And the first comment sounds like you got rude and defensive against someone who genuinely sounds like they didn\u2019t understand the difference between an anxiety attack and a panic attack. You\u2019ve got more than a depression issue in my opinion.", "Why is it her business to comment upon OPs feelings?", "Thank you! I am horrified by how many people who think that poor girl deserved to be publicly humiliated for making an effort to sympathize. It was a faux pas, not a hate crime.", "Oh no!

I don\u2019t see PROOF of malice from her. Maybe she\u2019s just socially tone deaf. Sounds like you\u2019ve been very willing to go off on her on more than one occasion. (\u201cI went off about how anxiety is not the same as panic attacks\u2026\u201d) I mean, damn. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I saw her heartbroken and confused side of the story in one of my autism subreddits. If you\u2019re feeling offended, invalidated or unsupported by someone who is \u201cvery ignorant about mental health,\u201d there are lots of constructive ways to respond to them that don\u2019t include going off on them. Maybe she\u2019s an AH. Maybe not.  Regardless, your behavior has guaranteed that there\u2019s at least one asshole in this situation. It\u2019s you.

There was definitely a stage where it shifted into something I couldn't manage, but if I hadn't experienced that, I wouldn't know.\n\nShe was being annoying and inappropriate but she wasn't being mean. You were mean.\n\nESH", "Telling someone that they look depressed and should cheer up has no good intentions in it. Telling someone who was suffering from panic attacks that you get anxious but still manage to show up is malicious. Both times this girl chose to speak, it was pure ignorance. NTA", "I\u2019m not gonna drag you but I disagree that OP being nasty wasn\u2019t needed. 2 times she\u2019s had some mental health issues this particular person made 2 very ignorant comments. Claiming that she still manages to make it to class even tho she is anxious is nowhere near the same as having a panic attack. Then she proceeds to tell someone, in front of an entire classroom, that they look depressed and should cheer up. That isn\u2019t how depression works, you don\u2019t just \u201ccheer up\u201d because if that were the case, nobody on this earth would be depressed. When it comes to someone\u2019s mental health, and you clearly know absolutely nothing, keep your mouth shut.", "I trust OP to know whether she had a panic attack or not, and how anxious she was at the time.\n\nI\u2019ve had a memorable one while feeling perfectly calm and safe. My body just went into overdrive. No anxiety involved. It was most inconvenient. \n\nWhatever happened then in private, telling strangers to cheer up is rude. OP was rude back, but the other girl\u2019s reaction was not proportional. She could have said \u2018sorry\u2019 and moved on."]}
