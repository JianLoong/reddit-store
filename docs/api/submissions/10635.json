I guess not based on what you\u2019ve written. And did the psychologist you met with not explain that *panic attacks are a symptom of anxiety?* \n\nYTA just for being so clueless about mental health. Pretty funny you had the nerve to write that your classmate is very ignorant about it. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTAH - she kept publicly making comments about your private medical issues in a demeaning way.  You had already privately asked her to stop it and she choose to continue doing it.  There is a reason the rest of the class was giving her looks - she was out of line.  She earned this. You did nothing wrong.  Maybe she will learn from this and stop doing it.  Though I doubt it because she still does not seem to understand that she is in the wrong.", "Yta. Weaponised narcissism.", "I'm prepared to get dragged, but yeah. YTA. You were needlessly nasty.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nYes, she's 24 and should have more control her emotions. Sarcasm is no reason to have a breakdown like that. _At the same time,_ she didn't know you had lost a pet, nor that you had been diagnosed with clinical depression. In today's society, the words \"depressed/depression\" are used so commonly and interchangeably with other words like \"upset\" or \"sad\" and things like that. They aren't used according to their clinical meanings. It's unfortunate, but that's how it is. You can't take that out on her. Especially when, yes, she could have worded it better, or not said anything it all, but _was not trying to be malicious._ Se overreacted imo, but you were rude.\n\nI am sorry for the loss of your dog, OP.", "Oh wow! Just because she told you to chear up?\nYTA. Depression is not your only problem, entitlement, rage and lack of empathy are probably just some of them.", "Yum yum.  Karma on the *spoon*!   :)", "I'm on the fence about this one, but agree that OP was needlessly nasty!\n\nI don't think the girl is malicious: OP hasn't given any indication of that. However, OP's classmate put her in an awkward situation by commenting about her demeanor in front of everyone else.\n\nI think OP was justified in standing up for herself, but I do think her scathing retort was an overreaction.\n\nESH. Hopefully the classmate understands that OP doesn't like her and stops trying to engage!!", "I mean she's 24, not 14. She should know that being depressed isn't the same thing as being upset or sad and it's not OPs fault she didn't seem to understand that. Especially after the panic attack thing, you'd think she wouldn't just blurt out random things. She should've had more thought over what she was saying. And you're right, she had no reason to start crying like that, it almost seems as if she was trying to play the victim.

So for OP to go off on the classmate for something she knows nothing about (including OP's diagnosis and loss of the foster pet) seems like an AH move to me. Then again, this is just my opinion, which is what this sub is for.", "She's 24, she should know to not speak of things she doesn't know a lot about. And that's common knowledge, it's called depression for a reason. Her lack of understanding doesn't make OP the AH.", "NTA", "NTA. She's a 24 year old acting like a 14 year old and I feel justified in judging her maturity as I am a couple years younger than her. Any mature adult knows not to give out advice on stuff they know little to nothing about. Any mature adult can handle someone being upset with them without storming off crying. I honestly don't care if she was \"just trying to be nice\", her words were still harmful, and if she hadn't learned the harm those words have in 24 years, it was about time someone went off on her to teach her that lesson.", "Yta..... so everyone is supposed to read your mind and know what's happening in your life?   It's not ok to act like an AH just bc you're going thru a rough time. It's not ok to embarrass others just bc you think others should know by looking at you, what you're going thru. News flash.... ppl can't read minds.  Maybe that was your classmates' way of noticing you were sad, not knowing why and trying to help..... but you were an AH.  And nobody cares what your Dx is.... it's not a badge of honor to use to whip at ppl as you plz to gain extra sympathy and excuse crass behavior such as you displayed.", "Ok while I understand you're going through a lot how are others supposed to know that and why would you get mad at someone for being clueless about something they aren't familiar with? She doesn't sound like she was being malicious and you went into full attack mode. ESH.", " Yta", "YTA\n\nYou went nuclear on her for no reason. She wasn\u2019t being malicious and you could\u2019ve gently explained that her comment is really not helpful and that you\u2019re going through a lot right now instead of making a scene and embarrassing her in front of her peers", "I'm going to have to steal this phrase", "I thought the same. It's one of those situations in which OP is not *quite* the AH here but is certainly an AH in general.\n\nShe's 29 but responds like a snotty teenager to a clumsy though not ill-intended gesture. Even OP's writing style betrays self-centeredness and immaturity.", "Frankly, 24-year-olds shouldn't need the basic rudiments of mental health explained to them. Anyone who still doesn't get what depression is at this point is willfully, deliberately ignorant. It's basically like still not understanding what the flu is.", "They *aren't* the same thing. One can be a symptom of the other, but they aren't the same thing. \n\nGod knows why you have any upvotes on this.", "Anxiety is being extremely nervous/anxious. You're tense and your heart beat increases. It can be extremely unpleasant but most of the time it's something you can power through. Panic attack makes you feel like you're dying. You're dissociating, it's hard to breathe, you can experience chest pain and other symptoms that make it seem like a heart attack. Comparing panic attacks to anxiety is like comparing a migraine to a normal headache.", "It sounds like OP just doesn\u2019t like this girl so anything she says will be taken as a slight. She could literally just be trying to get OP to cheer up because from what OP described this isn\u2019t mean at all??", "As a 21 (soon-to-be 22) yr old, I can't think of anyone my age that I've met after high school who would tell a depressed person to \"cheer up\". Every decent person I know would ask (in private) \"Hey, you seem upset, do you want to talk?\". A 24 year old has no business being that ignorant.", "Oh, honey. Anxiety is a symptom of panic attacks?? What the what\u2026. \n\nSigh. If you have a symptom then that means you have a condition, right? Her symptom is panic attacks. \n\nWhere in the DSM-5 does it list \u201canxiety\u201d as a symptom of \u201cpanic attacks\u201d Answer: nowhere, because \u201cpanic attacks\u201d isn\u2019t the name of a mental disorder. In other words, you couldn\u2019t diagnose someone with Panic Attacks\u2026. Therefore anxiety can\u2019t be a symptom of them. \n\nNow, there is a diagnosis called Panic Disorder\u2026 which is classified as a type of *anxiety disorder*. Its diagnostic criteria don\u2019t include anxiety. They do include panic attacks. Meaning panic attacks are a symptom of an anxiety disorder. \n\nLike, mah dude\u2026 depression is not a symptom of suicidal ideation, for example. \n\nJesus. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Exactly. I grew up in the 90s and I know damn well that this shit isn't obscure knowledge to young people anymore. It's utterly basic.", "Are you really too stupid to understand that panic attacks can occur as a result of an anxiety disorder, but that having an anxiety disorder does not always manifest as panic attacks?\n\nI mean, you said a lot of shit up there, but it all seems to be failing to understand some really basic stuff. Anxiety as a symptom of panic attacks? Yeah, no shit that isn't in the DSM. Because it's random word salad you vomited trying to sound smart.", "Awwwwww, this is so pitiful. I feel genuinely bad for you. But it\u2019s also pretty freaking hilarious. You\u2019re the one that claimed that anxiety can be a symptom of panic attacks, but I\u2019m the one vomiting word salad!!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd57\ud83e\udd57\ud83e\udd57\ud83e\udd57\ud83e\udd57\n\nBut hey, whatever gets ya through your day!", "Based on these multiple needlessly insulting responses, name checks out.", "\"They aren't the same thing. One can be a symptom of the other, but they aren't the same thing.\"\n\nNo, chief, you *decided* that was what I meant. Based on nothing but your own confusion about a basic idea. \n\n\"[Panic attacks] can be a symptom of [anxiety], but they aren't the same thing.\"\n\nDoes that help you? Can you follow basic ideas yet?", "Can you not see the sheer condescension in the posts I'm replying to? I typically don't stay polite when I'm insulted.
