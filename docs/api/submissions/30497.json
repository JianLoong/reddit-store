His relationship with his ex wife was apparently over and he was contemplating separation when my friend and him started seeing each other. Now while my friend and him were dating, he got his wife pregnant! Again, he being the victim, said that his wife seduced him when he brought up divorce and he had a moment of weakness. \nThe wife refused to abort and he made her leave after learning about the pregnancy and had no involvement throughout the pregnancy. He was not even there for the birth of his child. His family attempted to see the child months after she was born but his ex wife refused. \nMy friend has struggled with the news of the pregnancy but at the same time chose to stay by him. One day she told me that she has categorically instructed him to pay off the ex wife and child in a one time settlement in the divorce and not have any contact with the child  in future. Now it is pertinent to mention here that I am a single mother myself going through a horrific divorce and custody battle. It is perhaps due to my personal experience, I advised my best friend to keep an open mind about her boy friend\u2019s child\u2026because he may have a change of heart and want to get to know his child or the child may want to know her father or even need him at some point (our country especially isn\u2019t exactly rosy for single mothers and even in this day and age, father\u2019s name/ signatures are asked for almost everywhere). I don\u2019t expect my friend to step into the role of a super mom, I JUST asked her to not shut herself out to the idea of this child being in her life at some point. \nThis proved to be such a turning point in our friendship that she has now come to the conclusion that she can no longer be friends with me because I am unsupportive and I made her feel judged and guilty. \nI have always given this boyfriend the benefit of doubt and even though I had my reservations about this guy, I have always been supportive of her relationship because she seems happy and in love with him.

She's mad because she knows her actions are horrible.", "NTA. \n\nYour friend is a selfish person who can\u2019t tolerate an objective, dissenting opinion. If someone makes you feel guilty, it\u2019s worth examining that feeling to see if they have a point.\n\nHer boyfriend is weak, lacking in integrity and responsibility. His soon to be ex-wife might be a manipulative seductress or she might not be, but that sounds an easy if unflattering and simplistically blamey excuse for a bad decision they both made amongst the complex emotions of an unravelling marriage.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing you did wrong was not being the one to end the friendship with this awful person first.", "NTA What your friend is proposing is very wrong (and in many countries it\u2019s not possible to give up legal parenthood unless the kid is adopted). She has been showing very selfish and questionable behavior. I\u2019d sure hope my friends would tell me if I did something like that.", "NTA\n\nIt's always fun when you see the single dad side compared with the single mom side. On one, you're usually demanded to pay everything off and get rid of whatever may be annoying. On the other, you're usually demanded to embrace her 15 children or you're not a real man. \n\nNTA absolutely. Moreover, this will always be a possible occurrence **when you date a married person**.", "NTA. What are friends for if not to tell us some hard truths when it is needed? I also don't accept the line that this is none of your business, you two are best friends of 25 years standing, and clearly had a very deep and strong relationship.\n\nYour friend lashed out at you because she knows what she is doing/proposing to do is wrong, and since she can't deal with the guilt, she has transformed it into rage at you for having pointed this out to her.", "NTA. Friendships aren\u2019t about agreeing with the other person all the time. That would be toxic AF. Your point is extremely valid and something that should be considered. The boyfriend and your friend sound pretty terrible.", "I\u2019m sorry but why do you want this woman in your life? She sounds awful.", "NTA. Yeah, I couldn't be friends with this person anymore either. That's awful.", "Your friend or should I say former friend was the mistress.

The whole situation is fucked, I'm leaning toward NTA, but you may have overstepped here. I also feel for the child, who is innocent in all of this, and your friend did get into a relationship with a married man, which means she really can't be the \"good guy\" in this situation, but I feel like telling a person to strip any relationship with their child is way over the top, especially coming from the \"home wrecker\"", "Based on the info given, NTA. You might still be TA but I'd need to hear your friends side. But if it is as you say she's monstrous to expect someone to \"pay off\" his ex and newborn child.", "NTA, but still there is some issues with this like what the others said, you\u2019re best friend is trying to separate his child, but you\u2019re also slightly the asshole because you\u2019re trying to get in her business and supporting the relationship", "ESH. YTA for supporting this dumpster fire of a relationship in the first place, instead of pointing your friend toward therapy. They're perfect for each other, and it's not going to end well.", "ESH. A few factors here:\n\nIt\u2019s not really your business, so YTA. \n \n\u201cFriend\u201d is trying to manipulate her partner into NC with his own child. It\u2019s not about her. She\u2019s the biggest A. \n\nthe partner should have kicked her to the curb for even suggesting it. Also TA.", "Soft TA. It was not your concern what they choose to do. I get your point and yes, it sounds like an awfull idea. But it also sounds like the mother doesn't want the father in the picture (or wants to manipulate him, if the seduction story is true). It can be soul crushing for a father to know there is a child who they are never allowed to see, because of the mother. So cutting the child out can be in some situations be the right choice for everyone. \n\nI agree with you, he should maybe leave some for of possible for the child to know him - like a sperm donor does. So the child could contact him, when it is 14, 16 or 18 years old. But just as 'meeting the person, who is related to me' and not as 'having a father'\n\nBut it is not your place to judge the situation based on your own. You would be allowed to give suggestions, but try to convince them to do other or to force them to do, what you think is right", "Esh\n\nI'd rather have a lump sum than deal with a cheating ex", "Both - kinda NTA for just mentioning it but YTA because it\u2019s none of your business.", "YTA\n\nThis is none of your business.\n\nYou should have kept out of it, because now you have lost a friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're right, she behaved very badly.", "Your friend is already in the wrong for dating a married man. Not sure of the laws in your country, but hopefully his wife (not ex, since the divorce isn't finalized) rejects a one-time payment unless it's enough to live in luxury the rest of her and her child's life. Your friend should be judged for her actions,  and you shouldn't support her in having an affair with a married man and convincing him to abandon his child.  I'm not sure why you want to stay friends with her if this is what she thinks is okay,  but you're NTA.", "NTA, the rest in this story have a special level of AHry", "I can literally quote what I said word by word because this hit me hard. I told her that I feel she needs to at least give this a thought with an open mind because there will always be a possibility (no matter how little) that this child may be part of her life at some point. I told her that if she stands in the way then, it might cause a lot of resentment on his part, let alone the child.

We\u2019ve grown up together and I\u2019ve always looked to her for advice, no matter how harsh it maybe.

Or can even say lost?", "Does not sound bad to me, I would give your friend a little space. I'd guess you touched a nerve of guilt when she was hoping to hear that she was doing the right thing. I kind of feel you may be better off not involved in this situation anyway.", "I think you need to take a hard look at the person you\u2019ve been relying on for advice all these years.\n\nI also think you need to ask yourself how equal this friendship was. It kind of sounds like the trust you describe only flowed in one direction.", "Have backed off\u2026that\u2019s all I can do. But this is eating me up. Part of me also refuses to believe this is her and it kills me that I can\u2019t be there for her", "It sounds like she\u2019s making life choices that anyone with a shred of integrity simply cannot support. And she\u2019s not interested in anything short of full-throated support right now, because *any* amount of skepticism is a harsh reminder that she\u2019s doing something wrong."]}
