Two things could happen here, he will eventually blame her for making him cut contact or he will eventually leave her, move on to the next one and never have a relationship with his child. Either way, your friend is incredibly selfish and you are a good person for calling her out. \nIn my country you need the fathers signature with everything. I'm a single mother.

That's what's wrong with kids in today's time.

If she can't handle the truth, then maybe she doesn't deserve your friendship. You are completely in the right!", "NTA. Your friend has shown that she is not the person you thought she was, and that you don\u2019t like who she is.

It's your friend that is living in an alternate reality.", "NTA. Your friend is a homewrecker and won't look at the situation from your point of view.

If she does not want to be friends with you because of differing opinions on this situation, by all means, leave the homewrecking byatch alone.", "NTA. If he does cut contact, that won't stop that kid from seeking him out in 20ish years. When they find out that she was responsible for them not having a father, they are gonna be pissed, and resentful towards both of them. She is doing this to a CHILD. She needs to grow up. That's the risk you take when dating a married man.", "NTA! Friends, especially best friends are usually the people in your life to be the most upfront and honest with you. It\u2019s something that you felt needed to be said; to expect him to cut a child out of his life is messed up even if he/she was conceived in a not so savory way. How about she look at the view from the point of that child? It would not be right for that child to grow up without a father, children thrive on both parents being present. Honestly, she should cut ties with this guy cause I believe he probably isn\u2019t over his wife yet; takes a lot of healing after a divorce to properly move on. But honestly, if she wants to cut you out of her life over a man and your honesty, let her go. She will regret it and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be the last time you hear from her", "NTA. \nYour \"friend\" is in serious denial if she thinks BF and his wife were separated before they started dating. \n\n>she can no longer be friends with me because I am unsupportive and I made her feel judged and guilty.\n\nChances are she knows that BF and his wife weren't separated, and she feels judged and guilty because she has something to feel guilty for. You refuse to let her lie to you and to herself to make her feel better. It probably sucks to rewrite reality in her brain and then have you call her out. It's hard to live in Oz when your best friend keeps reminding you that you're in Kansas, so to speak. \n\nYour friend is not a respectable person. Seems like she did you a favor by bailing.", "NTA! You dodge a big one in the friendship department. She\u2019ll more than likely end up in the ex-wife\u2019s shoes and his new woman will tell him the same! She\u2019ll get her Karma!", "And this is the way of the world these days.  People share their problems, you give advice that different to what they want to hear and then you are the bad one.  When was the turning point for humanity becoming so f'ing soft that it can't handle a difference of opinion. FML", "Okay, I may be biased, but this is very similar to what happened with my mom and birth father. True, they were never married, but they were engaged, and he was always cheating on my mom. He even got another woman pregnant while he was with my mom. His (now ex) wife was actually a side chick he\u2019d had when he first moved down to Florida. He then cheated on her and now they\u2019re divorced and he has a new partner. But he literally dropped Mom and I like a sack of potatoes when she called him out on his bullsh*t and broke up with him. He literally *did not try* to contact me from the time I was 5 y/o to two days before my 18th birthday. I do have a wonderful relationship with his parents, his sisters, his BILs, and his nieces and nephew. The only one on his side of the family that I have a sh*t relationship with is him.\n\nSo no, you are NTA. I wish someone had said something to my father when he decided to ditch me.

Your friend is just grappling with the idea that this man, who was so over his wife he wanted a separation but also claims to be the victim of her seduction, isn't who she thought he was.", "his wife \"seduced\" him while they were not yet divorced? he was a \"victim\"? i smell bs. YNTA but I think your friend doesn't know what she's getting herself into and wants to have some control over the whole situation.", "Your friend actually was a mistress and broke a marriage up. She is foolish to think he will stay faithful. If they do it with you, they will do it to you. You do not need a friend like that. Let her go.", "NTA - He\u2019s a cheating deadbeat and that seems to be what your friend likes the most about him.", "Well, at least it sounds like they are well on their way toward a miserable life together. NTA.", "NTA. No reasonable person should expect their significant other to cut their child out of their life. But if she cuts you out of hers over this, you get the benefit of not having to listen to her whine when what's happening to the wife happens to her.", "NTA but your friend sure is, you should consider whether you really want to be HER friend...", "Your friend will come running back to you when he cheats on her (again)", "NTA.  If I were you, I would reconsider my friendship with this person.  She is willing to alienate an innocent child, deprive the child of its father, and encourage him to be a deadbeat dad.  There is nothing redeeming about this woman.  Why are you still her friend?", "NTA... for your advice about the child \n\nHOWEVER you have a poor choice in friends. She sleeps with married men - and then gives them ultimatums to abandon their children. They are both ugly and deserve each other.", "NTA she feels guilty and like a shitty person because she\u2019s actually both of those things. It\u2019s nothing to do with you.

But YTA for supporting her in being a mistress to a married man. Should have waited until a divorce was finalized. The only exception really is if they were truly poly or swingers and there was no expectation of monogamy from any of those involved (but clearly there was).", "NTA She knows she's wrong, she just doesn't like you calling her out on it.\n\nWhen you take into account everything that could have been pointed to her about this situation, what you said was pretty tame, even kind.\n\nRather than blaming you for wanting her to be prepared, she should work on the guilt she feels for staying with her boyfriend.

Cool beans.\n\nESH", "NTA. The dude has a kid. The circumstances of the child\u2019s birth don\u2019t matter.  He should make every reasonable effort to be a father.", "NTA she doesn't need to have any involvement with the child but demanding that he has no involvement with his child is unreasonable, and not to mention cruel to the child. That poor child is innocent in all of this and deserves to have a father. Especially if the boyfriend does want some involvement. I'm curious if he had had no contact because he truly doesn't want any or if he's letting the friend manipulate/Control him. He may feel guilty about getting his ex pregnant and is worried about his gf leaving if he admits to wanting to see the child. Of course I have no idea. But demanding that a father has  no contact with his child is wrong", "NTA. And you are right. But I would go further and suggest she should cut herself off from this man. Utter nonsense about his ex seducing him as if she put him in a trance and couldn\u2019t say no. Then he goes on to cut her out and his own child. When he gets bored of her and can\u2019t keep it in his pants, she may be ditched for a newer model. She should run away from all of it.
