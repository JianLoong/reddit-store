I\u2019ve contracted yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis in the past due to not insisting that partners wash their hands, and it\u2019s really unpleasant. It\u2019s totally normal and happens all the time, but proper hygiene is how to avoid it. Now anyone touching me must wash their hands first, and no one has ever disagreed. Our hands are covered in bacteria, and often contain small cuts or abrasions. This is why many people wear gloves to protect their partners. Anyone who\u2019s going to be using their bare hands for pleasuring someone with a vulva (this probably goes for anal penetration too) should thoroughly wash their hands with hot soapy water for 20 seconds. This is also why keeping your fingernails trimmed short and smooth and using a nail brush to clean underneath them is very helpful.

Good hygiene, in general, is good health. But the brushing of teeth and scrubbing of skin causes microabrasions, which I've read when done right before engaging in sex can lead to increased risk of infection. Do what works best for you. But if her hygiene is good in general, then you might not need the pre-sex routine\n\nDoes your gf practice good hygiene?", "YTA because it sounds like you're waiting until your getting it on then being surprised that in the moment she hasnt washed her hands and brushed her teeth. It is also saying hey we can never have spontaneous sex.\n\nInstead why not talk about how you can both mansge your routines. Maybe suggest that when you get home from work you both freshen up if that is when you tend to get sexy? Or start jumping in the shower together pre sex.\n\nAlso, do you pee after sex? Have you had an std test? Have you tried different lube? Have you made sure you're not eating sweets before oral? It seems like you might have jumped to a solution before ruling everything out.\n\nIf I know I'm likely to have sex I'll shower and do my teeth etc (obvs I also do that routinely but I mean I'll do it as an extra). But I would hate for some impromptu horniness to be met by a nag on have you washed your hands and brushed your teeth... That's just super unsexy. Of course if I'd bbeen doing something dirty like cooking or gardening etc since I last washed my hands I'd be like give me a sec I need to freshen up. But if I've just been hanging out there really is no need.", "YTA. I literally can't imagine how humiliated and gross I would feel if I'm in the middle of initiating sex with my partner and they ask me if my teeth are brushed like I'm a child.

Do you wash yourself immediately after sex? That's more likely to make a difference. She may have a slight subclinical yeast infection, you guys might have incompatible skin flora, you might have a sensitivity to a lube that you are using. \n\nThe brushing teeth thing is weird to me, I can't see how it would make a difference. Both of you should be washing hands before and after. I would drop the request for tooth brushing, and focus on cleaning off your skin afterwards.", "NAH- however this kind if stuff works both ways. Sometimes you will need to let this go so that her need to be spontaneous will be fulfilled. If you can\u2019t do that then you guys seem incompatible sexually.

Maybe dab some perfume while you're at the sink if you two like fragrances, something to make it more than just hygiene.\n\nBefore that though, you need to have a conversation outside of the bedroom about why this is important to you - nothing will stick if she doesn't understand your needs.

Just end it already", "Well, your gf seems like she wants spontaneous sex rather than planned assignations, which is a perfectly reasonable preference. She wants sleepy morning \"we just woke up and I want you now\" sex, or \"I can't keep my hands off you over a romantic dinner or a movie on the couch, and now we're tumbling in to bed sex\". That's understandable.\n\nYou have a health concern. You think your feeling after sex is connected to her giving you a little extra gift with her hands or mouth. It seems perfectly reasonable to me to propose an elimination test to her. Have her agree that for the next 2-3 weeks, you will both go and wash up and brush teeth immediately before getting it on. Yeah, this won't be great sex for her: it will feel planned and clinical, and that's not what she likes. But you're doing this as a test to see whether it's an issue. \n\nDoes your feeling persist? If so, it's not the fact that she didn't wash up first.\n\nNAH", "Being clean before intimacy is not a buzzkill. It\u2019s just basic consideration for your partner.

My partner and I ALWAYS brush our teeth and wash hands before sexy time to prevent any possibility of infection. We're hypersexual, so we have sex a LOT. For us, the ritual of grooming has become part of foreplay, to such an extent that I get turned on by the smell of toothpaste. My point is that it shouldn't be an issue, and there's nothing wrong with trying to keep you both healthy.\n\nMaybe sit with your GF and explain to her why this is so important to you, and ask her to help you make it a fun ritual. And maybe try saying, \"Let's go brush our teeth,\" instead of asking her if she has. She might feel sensitive and embarrassed if she forgot.", "NTA. it\u2019s not sexy to have a dirty mouth or to feel itchy.", "NTA.\n\nAlthough it may seem to ruin the spontaneity, sexual hygiene is important. Washing each other's hands can be very sensual, especially knowing what's to come. And certainly you can continue the foreplay while she brushes her teeth. It might help her know that you're still attracted to her, and that you don't think she's an unclean person.", "NTA. Could even be a hand lotion or something that partner uses that\u2019s bothering you. Or it could be unrelated, but you\u2019re totally allowed to ask her to wash her hands, and to ask about it.

NTA at all to have preferences about the health of your body and preferences during intimacy. You and your partner may just not me compatible though. If she\u2019s refusing to wash her hands, even after knowing it\u2019s important to you, and she\u2019s just been touching germ-laden cell phone and car keys etc, then it\u2019s gonna be an issue for you guys for sure.

You should have communicated why you were always asking that because she probably felt like you were treating her like a kid in monitoring her hygiene lol. And I can see why that would ruin the moment. Perhaps just ask her (when you\u2019re not about to have sex) to please try to wash her hands and brush her teeth before sex and then trust her to respect your wishes so you don\u2019t have to ask all the time and ruin the moment. I know my husband and I have had similar frustrations that really just come down the miscommunication.", "NTA, your health is more important than her wanting to be spontaneous. If you are having reoccurring issues after you two have sex than it is important to try to find out why. If washing her hands and brushing her teeth help than idk why she wouldn't want to do that. If you are asking your partner to do something that will make sex better and give you peace of mind and they won't maybe re-evaluate the relationship.", "It\u2019s BV. Very common with lesbians. Get a probiotic suppository OP. I do ask my girlfriend to wash up as well as we are at a lot higher risk of BV. But sometimes like your partner said, spontaneity is key. Hence the probiotic. :)\n\nEdited to add: BV is basically an overhaul of the bad bacteria in the vagina.", "Ugh why would you have to have sex with someone who hadn\u2019t brushed their teeth and washed their hands? That\u2019s disgusting", "Does she wear lip balm or gloss? You can get those that \"plump\" the lip and it can make your lips tingle...just thought I'd check in to rule that one out.", "Maybe you guys could build a routine of freshening up right before bed which could then transition into activities (or not). If you're waiting until things are getting hot and then pausing to do that I could see how it could kill the mood and be hard to recover from.", "I was a sex worker and vaginas and vulvas often don\u2019t like overwashing. Not just soap but lots of water (two showers in max an hour) after hands, toys, tongue, mouth and the mixing of microbiomes is often a reason for unexplained itching around the genitals. Also toothpaste and mouthwash straight away can be a bad idea. High alcohol in mouthwash. Many toothpastes use sugar alcohols to help taste. Also both can have tingling effects.\n\nI\u2019m a woman who has sex with women and men. I also used to be a make up artist and genitals can be quite like faces: the wrong kind of cleansing can cause issues. You are on some days showering your vulva and vagina three times? You are removing a lot of the natural bacteria and moisture barrier of it which leads to a dry itchiness similar to overwashing hands so they itch. \n\nThen you are putting the toothpaste/mouthwash on dry mucous membranes. This is similar to how some communities thought a woman being too wet was actually what helped semen and disease \u2018slide\u2019 inside. So it became tradition to wash first using vinegar, alcohol, herbs that worked similarly to dry things out for safer sex. These communities in parts of Southern Africa had the highest rates of HIV even with condoms. It was when attitudes were changed about women\u2019s lubrication, microtears reduced, BV reduced which increases risk for other infection and there was less condom tearing and HIV transmission.\n\nNow some of that doesn\u2019t apply here but simply and bluntly if you wash a lot of your natural balance out before and after and don\u2019t use lube, it\u2019s very likely things itch because your GF\u2019s finger(s) are rubbing an unprepared surface to irritation and then you shower the irritation washing any protection further away.\n\nSex workers and many people have methods of keeping clean but not to the point of essentially vaginal contact dermatitis. And we do ask clients to clean up. But this the advice I check through with newer workers after years of experience. Men get it too esp if circumcised. Also I check how they are cleaning vulva. Vaginas are self cleaning, vulvas should be gently cleaned inside with just skin temp water and the outside with a gentle cleanser of your choice. Oatmeal based like Aveeno might help. The skin gets dehydrated. \n\nHonestly as your skin is the largest organ you have to handle each area of it differently but generally skin does not enjoy overwashing. Personally there\u2019s a lot of toothpastes and mouth washes I would want nowhere near it. Especially those with artificial sweeteners.\n\nEDIT: DO NOT USE HAND SANITISER AS SOMEONE SUGGESTED. It is 95% alcohol. You should not touch mucous membranes after using it unless you glove up. I did not know so many people did not know genitals and alcohol do not mix externally either. Heavy drinking can impact microbiome. Topical ends up a bit too near taxidermy.", "Again, I'm not saying you should, I'm saying the wrong time to tell them is when they're almost inside you", "Two AFAB people might still use lube for toys, or latex (condoms on toys for easy cleanup, or dental dams for oral)!", "Yep that\u2019s valid", "Fair point!", "Or is it possible to do the routine together. Like showering before and making it into a \"fun\" thing?"]}
