We have attended church together since we started dating and now we are married with 4 kids. I came from a different Christian background but have attended his church with him. His mother helped found the church we attend and several of his friends are pastors in churches in the denomination around the country. \n\nProblem: our daughter came out as pansexual and has had multiple hospitalizations to deal with depression resulting from this and bullying she has had to deal with. Last year, my husband and I were called in to our church by two elders. I was asked point blank how I felt about homosexuality. I told them I didn\u2019t thing God made mistakes and that all were beautiful and God\u2019s creation. I was told I should follow my husband\u2019s lead and tell my daughter she was wrong. I said I had no intention of telling an already traumatized teenager any of that and that I supported her. I also told them that I had research I could share with them about this from my\nMasters in Social Work program - from a Christian university, that says that I\u2019m correct. They refused to look at any of it and just said I was wrong. I left the church and haven\u2019t been back. \n\nQuestion: My husband continues to attend this church without me. This has gone on for a year and every time he goes, it feels like a betrayal. I\u2019ve told him I don\u2019t think our marriage can survive if he continues to attend a church that made me feel so unwelcome and attacked our daughter the way they did. I also told him that his beliefs about gay people were a problem and I was worried about the message he is sending our daughter. \n\nAITA for telling him that we need to choose another church to attend together, and that our marriage can\u2019t survive if he continues to attend the one that denounced our child?\n\nUPDATE: I didn\u2019t clarify this earlier. Sorry about that. I know this is MUCH bigger than church. I did start divorce proceedings after this happened. I paused it because my daughter said she felt like she was the reason for the divorce and I couldn\u2019t convince her otherwise. She needed to be hospitalized again so I have put a pause on this for now.

Parents like him have been known to ship their kids of to conversation therapy camp where the kids are tortured, abused and sometimes will resort to suicide.", "NTA. As someone whose parents chose God countless times over my wellbeing I can say  you've done the right thing for your kid. When religion is ONE of many ingredients that make up a healthy functioning family, that's great. When a Parent turns on a child because of a belief, that's not right. The problem is with the husband & he needs to get a perspective on what's more important. To me it's a healthy happy unconditionally loved child.", "NTA for insisting that he start attending a different church. \n\nBut, seriously, you need to get your child away from him, especially if the trauma is causing your daughter to be hospitalized for depression. Your edit says you\u2019ve paused divorce proceedings because your daughter believes it\u2019s because of her. That adds a huge wrench to the issue. I hope her mental health care team, which hopefully specializes in supporting the LGBTQIA+ community, can help guide you on how to roll this out in a way that allows her to deal with it in a healthy way.", "NTA. This is so serious because you've mentioned hospitalisations. Does your husband not realize that your child could lose her life? She deserves a supportive father but it sounds like that won't happen. Do what you have to to protect your child, no matter the cost.", "If you actually loved your daughter you would have left him years ago", "Why in this dystopia future we live in do people even bother to care what a bigot in a outdated belief system thinks about anything?\n\nNTA, I cannot fathom someone choosing a church over a family member. But it's clear this marriage has deep problems.\n\nBlessing of RA be upon you.", "Technically, NTA. But you have GOT to divorce that man. Get him away from your poor child. Do you think for a *minute* he\u2019s not part of the bullying? She needs nothing but support.", "You sound like a terrific mother.  I applaud you.  I'm so sorry you lost your church, and I very much hope you've found another much more tolerant and loving church family.   There are many churches out there that embrace all, love all, and accept all.  Please get yourself and your kids to one of those.\n\nAs for your husband, he is sending your child a terrible, possibly life-threatening message.  That's shameful behavior for a parent.  You're doing the right thing here in making your marriage turn on his willingness to find a church that will embrace your whole family.\n\nNTA", "ESH- \"I don't think God makes mistakes\". I don't understand how people can see suffering and say shit like this.  You and your husband's beliefs are harming your daughter.", "That church is a big part of the problem with the husband.", "His attitude is consistent with the church he attends. The issue is precisely that he continues to attend.

He\u2019s not changing.", "There's no way she didn't know husbands/churches views on  this before getting married right? Like most religious people, sounds like she was totally cool with it before and only cares now because it's affecting her.", "His attending that church is a sign that he doesn't prioritize his child's needs over that of his community. The church is a HUGE part of the problem too. He probably is a bigot because his religion tells him to be.", "Op is the asshole for procreating 4 damn times with such a bad person.", "TY! Jeez", "Churches like that are a problem though. They create people like the husband. If the church wasn't bigoted, I bet the husband wouldn't be either.", "OP put an important edit about this, which makes the story even sadder for their daughter.", "Your first point was EXACTLY my first thought. OP must have known and accepted the church's views until it affected her family. Am I glad she's supporting her child? Absolutely!

At first, I hoped he would change. The church thing, which really defined the depth of his bigotry only happened a year ago. I started divorce proceedings, but paused them because my daughter had another attempt on her life. She has therapists, psychiatrists, and we attend family therapy together. She has been explicit that she wants us to stay together. It is for her well-being that I put the divorce on hold because she hasn\u2019t been stable enough.", "I agree.

Or does he desire power because that\u2019s what this church told him he\u2019s entitled to?", "His mother was one of the founders of the church. It doesn't say how old he was when it was founded but it would not be unreasonable to conclude that he was raised in this exact church with these exact beliefs.\n\nThat would mean that the church is the chicken and he is the egg and I believe he gravitated to it because it was how he was raised.\n\nThat said, not all churches are like this.
