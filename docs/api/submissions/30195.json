We have attended church together since we started dating and now we are married with 4 kids. I came from a different Christian background but have attended his church with him. His mother helped found the church we attend and several of his friends are pastors in churches in the denomination around the country. \n\nProblem: our daughter came out as pansexual and has had multiple hospitalizations to deal with depression resulting from this and bullying she has had to deal with. Last year, my husband and I were called in to our church by two elders. I was asked point blank how I felt about homosexuality. I told them I didn\u2019t thing God made mistakes and that all were beautiful and God\u2019s creation. I was told I should follow my husband\u2019s lead and tell my daughter she was wrong. I said I had no intention of telling an already traumatized teenager any of that and that I supported her. I also told them that I had research I could share with them about this from my\nMasters in Social Work program - from a Christian university, that says that I\u2019m correct. They refused to look at any of it and just said I was wrong. I left the church and haven\u2019t been back. \n\nQuestion: My husband continues to attend this church without me. This has gone on for a year and every time he goes, it feels like a betrayal. I\u2019ve told him I don\u2019t think our marriage can survive if he continues to attend a church that made me feel so unwelcome and attacked our daughter the way they did. I also told him that his beliefs about gay people were a problem and I was worried about the message he is sending our daughter. \n\nAITA for telling him that we need to choose another church to attend together, and that our marriage can\u2019t survive if he continues to attend the one that denounced our child?\n\nUPDATE: I didn\u2019t clarify this earlier. Sorry about that. I know this is MUCH bigger than church. I did start divorce proceedings after this happened. I paused it because my daughter said she felt like she was the reason for the divorce and I couldn\u2019t convince her otherwise. She needed to be hospitalized again so I have put a pause on this for now.
