My grandpa has many health issues that are self inflicted due to him not taking care of himself either. I really emphasized that I was concerned about potential health issues if she didn't take care of herself, I repeated about a dozen or so times that it's about her health and nothing more.

This is going to take time to get better but to me it feels like I blew up 10 years by telling her the truth. I don't feel sorry for being honest. I don't feel guilty for her getting upset.

Huuuuuuge. You didn't approach this as health. You straight out and told her to lose weight tried to then go sideways and point to your family's hereditary issues and dismissed her points about hers.  You did Not  approach her tactfully or respectfully with lets get healthy or let's work out together or I want us to eat healthier. You flat-out attacked it as her weight issue without any consideration for her actual health or her history etc. Then you doubled down and showed no empathy for her emotions and hurt and are blaming her for having feelings and not \"getting over it\" You are a jerk.", "I think you two need couples therapy to learn how to communicate with each other more effectively. Bottling things up and not feeling like you can talk to your wife is a big issue. It isn\u2019t healthy. You two are partners, which means you need to be effective in your communication to maintain a healthy partnership.", "Good christ I need to stop visiting this subreddit, it\u2019s making me hate men. So many of you are so obtuse it genuinely boggles me?? durrrrr hey guys without her asking for my opinion I told my wife I think she\u2019s fat, and I don\u2019t care that I hurt her feelings! I was honest! In fact I\u2019m mad that she\u2019s acting upset. Honest opinions are unable to upset someone, didn\u2019t you know that? YTA if it wasn\u2019t clear", "Maybe she has seen your posting history on Reddit and is eating out of sadness.", "If she weighs less than 160, YTA. Really she should be absolutely enormous before you go there. Like 200+ for her height.\n\nAll you did was hurt her self-esteem and make her self conscious.", "I\u2019m torn. I can understand wanting her to be healthy, because my family also has diabetic issues and I\u2019ve also lost loved ones due to issues with that. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for wanting a loved one healthy and potentially live longer. I can also see how it could hurt someone by saying such things. Hope you two work it out soon.", "NTA. Ppl in the comments are wild. Your approach sucked but if she is 200+ at 5'4 that isn't going to be ok as she continues to get older. It's fact. That's it. You have two kids. Her healthy is important. Because your right being heavier can cause all sorts of issues in the future and obviously you want her healthy for the kids and herself. People love to scream body positivity and it's ok to be fat because I'm healthy...ya healthy now. But your body can only handle so much. IDC what you look like. You do you. Be you . But when you have kids involved you need to think about them.", "NTA . This is far mo complicated than it seems on the surface.  You've tried getting her to do activities together, you try balancing diet together and nothing sticks with her.  So you flat out say it. Was there a better way to say it?  Probably, but sometimes the shock factor of \"wow this is really an issue\" can shock them into change. Ultimately, and unfortunately, she has to WANT to lose weight. could you may e bring a 3rd party into this?  A trusted friend, relative, couple's therapist? Good luck.", "YTA, but ONLY because of how you approached it.\n\nIt's a health thing, you framed it like a weight thing. Your concerns are very legitimate, diabetes is a terrible thing and *not* something you want to mess with. (Honestly that's one of the things that's kept me exercising so much.. I don't ever want to end up where my dad is...)\n\nCould you have framed it better? Yes, absolutely. But your concern is real too.", "NTA - After 10 years, you should be able to have open an honest conversations.\n\nLooking at your other responses, I\u2019ve seen you\u2019ve tried tending tactful to no avail, so naturally you were direct.", "YTA, mostly because how you approached her and talks to and about her. You should have opened with your fear of her getting diabetes because it runs in your family and NOT her weight. Also, you complain about her loosing interest in a week or so when you try hiking and stuff. But have you really found out what kind of excercise SHE enjoys? Keep trying new things until you find the right fit. And make a proper meal plan together, for example that you eat healthy during the weeks but allow yourselves something extra on friday or saturday. You DID attack her weight and now you need to fix it. Just because you've been a couple for ten years doesn't mean you can insult her like that.", "YTA You gave her an ultimatum? That's not love or concern. I wouldn't be surprised if she changes her status from fiancee to ex. \n\nShe's also had two children which can be tough to shed the weight. Grow up.", "NTA. you're his partner in life, if you're worried, you should be able to tell her so. Doing a medical check up doesn't hurt too. Even if diabetes is a problem in your family and it does not impact her blood line, it doesn't mean she'll never suffer from it.\nUnless you were completely touch less when communicating I don't see why it must be offensive at all, that being said it's understandable she might feel hurt, possibly because she knows you're right but doesn't admit that to herself", "Wait, so because something is hereditary in your bloodline, your partner should change her lifestyle?\nSounds weird, does't it?\n\nHow about simply getting an activity that you both enjoy and be more active in or together changing theeals a bit or what is snacked Et cetera? \n\nSounds like yta", "NTA. I think it\u2019s important to have conversations like this. That said, now she knows how you feel about her weight and you needn\u2019t bring it up again.", "YTA. You basically fat shamed the mother of your children and made her feel unattractive. Woman put on some wait after having children. Maybe next time you can push a bowling ball out of your ****. Try suggesting activities you BOTH enjoy that can help her become more active.", "Yes, YTA for your approach, but not the sentiment/motivation to the conversation. Conversations about weight need to be approached really carefully, especially because society attaches so much value to a woman\u2019s weight. Being bombarded with media messages and person-to-person messages of \u201clow weight = attractive\u201d and \u201clow weight = valuable as a human being and worthy of being seen\u201d for years really fucks us women up. Having a conversation about reducing weight is always fraught. \n \nIt would\u2019ve been kinder/safer if you\u2019d opened with, \u201choney, I\u2019m worried about your health.\u201d  \u201cI want to make it clear to you that I\u2019m 100% just as attracted to you today as I was on the day we met.  I love you every part of you and every inch of your body.\u201d  \u201cI just want us both to make healthier choices about food.\u201d  \u201cI feel like you\u2019re getting less opportunity to be physically active than you used to.  How can I help with that?\u201d \u201cI am worried because I want to celebrate our 60th anniversary together one day. So I want us both to do what we can to improve our health.\u201d  There is a non-asshole way to have this conversation, but unfortunately that wasn\u2019t successful on the first go-around. \n \nYou mention having 2 kids.  I suspect that may translate to your fianc\u00e9e not having much time for self-care, or exercise, or going to the gym, or whatever, especially if most of the childcare falls on her. From her perspective, if you\u2019re going to try to put an obligation ON to her (like losing weight or daily exercise), then you should also probably try to take an obligation OFF her plate (like honey, if you want to sign up for a yoga class or something I\u2019m happy to handle childcare and get little Timmy to soccer on Thursdays.  Or whatever).  Giving her more to do without acknowledging and appreciating what she already does and facilitating some help to get shit done is an asshole move. \n \nAt this point, I think your best move is reiterating and demonstrating DAILY your level of continued attraction. She needs that. And talking about some healthy lifestyle choices you want to make TOGETHER. Shared goal-setting. You\u2019re not going to be exempt due to your physical job\u2014and what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.", "NTA", "NTA comon guysss let's not sugarcoat here whatever he is saying is right and he genuinely love her because there is no way someone will spend 10 fucking year together without being married he have every right to say whatever is bothering him being fat put u in danger of many type of disease specially if u are into your 30s and wanting your partner to look fit and good is nothing wrong either", "YTA\n\n\n>She's 5'4 and weighs more than I do.\n\nPeople have different body types.\n\n>I really emphasized that I was concerned about potential health issues if she didn't take care of herself, I repeated about a dozen or so times that it's about her health and nothing more.\n\nIf this is truly the case then don't bring her weight or body image into it at all\n\n>She told me that her family doesn't have those health issues,\n\nBelieve her and trust her. Did y'all have \"in sickness or in health\" as part of your ceremony? If she develops health issues then y'all can cross that bridge when you get there, until then is it really worth the state of your marriage or risking an eating disorder for her to lose a few pounds?\n\n>I still have difficulty telling her things that bother me. Sometimes I just don't want to cause a fight or I feel like I can just get over it so I don't say things much.\n\nYou need to work on communication skills more than anything else.

YTA", "YTA.\n\nMy goodness, isn\u2019t she lucky to have you! Without you she would never know that being overweight can be a risk factor for certain health issues. Doctors never mention it. It gets zero attention in the media. Where would she be if she didn\u2019t have you to tell stuff she doesn\u2019t know?\n\nMaybe tomorrow you can try mansplaining her job to her.", "Soft YTA.\n\nFirst of all, I want to say that I think you had good intentions, but the completely wrong approach. Your fianc\u00e9e carried two children and likely is already dealing with the fact that her body feels different; as her partner, she doesn\u2019t need criticism from you about something she is likely already struggling with - and you just doubled down.\n\nThe best way to help a partner struggling with weight is to change your lifestyle along side them. A better approach would have been: \u201cI love you and our kids so much; I want to change how we eat and our activities so that we can have this life as long as possible. Let\u2019s build menus that are more focused on foods that help our bodies and what do you think about starting to hike/talk more walks together?\u201d\n\nMy partner and I were really focused on helping our kids build a good relationship with food - because 90s diet culture screwed with us both. We refer to food in two categories: always foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, lean proteins, etc.) and sometimes foods (cake, candy, chips, donuts, etc.). Help your wife by building menus and making always foods the focus for your family.", "NTA \n\nBecause you did explain to her it\u2019s not about sexual attraction and you are attracted to her. But you\u2019re worried. \n\nLeave it for now. \n\nMaybe find some activities you both enjoy like getting both the kids out and seeing some nature", "NTA but i think your communication could have been done better. Overweight people are conscious and insecure about this whereby you vomiting your thoughts out got you in this situation. A lot of tact and slow buildup to confrontation would have helped tremendously. Ask her whether she would join you for being fit and plan for activities.", "YTA she didn't ask for your opinion or advice. You can express concern about her health but saying outright \"you're fat, you need to lose weight\" is hurtful. She gave birth to your kids which didn't help with weight gain. Does she have the time or energy to be more active? Do you allow her time to herself to look after herself?", "YTA you could have gone about that in many ways that could have been better. You could have focused on making healthier meals at home as a family, cooking together and learning new recipes can be romantic and fun. Also starting going on family walks together a few times a week instead of telling her that she needs to lose weight. Make it a family thing and not all about her and so what health problems run in YOUR family. That does not mean she will have those same problems. Also \"skinny\" people can also have diabetes and become diabetic so that logic isn't great. If I were you I would think about it and give her a real apology and let her know that you are just scared of losing her and that you went about the previous conversation the wrong way.", "YTA. And youre shitty for masking it behind health issues. Shes right, youre the one with the hereditary problems, not her. Basis you told her to lose some weight, its a dick move and she has the right to be hurt", "So you have a lovely wife who you\u2019re attracted to but worried she\u2019ll have health issues? \n\nThere are personal trainers who live a holistic life who end up with cancer, and people who live vicariously who have great health. \n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed yta", "Nta", "NTA - you've been together 10 years in what sounds like a healthy and stable relationship. If you made it clear you were concerned for her then I didn't see a problem\n\n*from a wife who is in your shoes and has a husband who responded by saying \"OK, I'll see what changes I can make\"", "NTA - There's several unwritten obligations of a marriage.  You're not married yet, instead engaged and been together 10 years with kids, so close enough for discussion.   \n\nOne of those obligations is to take reasonable care to stay healthy and attractive for your partner.   If she's just letting her body go into obesity, that as you pointed out greatly increases the chances of health issues, or even early death.   You're well within your right to tell her this is a problem.   This isn't you attacking her, this is her letting the family down and you trying to fix the problem.   \n\nHer getting defensive and not speaking to you for days tells me she has absolutely no intention of doing anything about her obesity.   \n\nYou mentioned she doesn't have sex either.   Well of course that isn't some kind of requirement, but the reason cheating with another person is considered so bad is because sex with your wife on some kind of reasonable basis is expected.   It is unreasonable for a wife to just not want sex with her husband in any kind of healthy marriage.   \n\nI'm sure she does a lot of good important things for your household, including the kids.  But she's letting you down on some of the basics of a healthy marriage.   Unfortunately she will only change if she  wants to, if she sees it's important for herself.   People never change for other people.   So you can keep trying to get her to come around, but I'd suggest that you proceed under the assumption that she will change nothing.   \n\nAsk yourself if the right thing for you is to enter into a sexless marriage with an obese woman.   She doesn't \"have\" to change, but you don't have to stay either.   Good luck", "YTA I lived this. No matter if your wife loses the weight she will never unhear what you've said. I was overweight for a long time. Over 200lbs at 5'1\". I had a very hard time losing weight, even doing everything I could. I had no actual health problems. \n\nMy husband commented more than once about my weight, tried to tell me it was for my health but it wasn't. Not to me. \n\nTurns out I ended up sick. I lost 80lbs as a result. Now all I can think is that he values me because I lost weight. The damage you have done to your wife psychologically is far worse than the weight she has on her body.", "YTA", "YTA", "Don't tell a woman to lose weight without taking her shopping for your mayday parachute.\n\n>I repeated about a dozen or so times\n\nDEFINITELY don't tell a woman to lose weight a dozen or so times in the same conversation. And yes, that is what trying to justify yourself with \"I repeated about a dozen or so times that it's about her health and nothing more\" sounds like. If ever you're going to be this daring, get in, get the light touch part of the conversation in, get OUT, and parachute to the couch.\n\n>I slept in our guest room for 5 days after this before she said she was fine with me sleeping in our bed together again\n\nYep. YTA, 5 days sounds about right. Not for telling her to lose weight, I agree with you that couples have to be willing to have tough conversations. But for telling her a dozen or so times in the same conversation. I think you owe her a good eleven apologies. There is no need to give up your stubbornness, she won't be that mad for withholding the twelfth.", "Have you ever actually tried encouraging a healthier lifestyle? And no I'm not talking about you telling her things she should do. But actually asking her to do activities together like going on family walks or meal prepping together.\n\nTelling her to lose weight is just not helpful at all. Almost every woman I have known has body/self image issues. You really crushed her.\n\nAlso I don't know how long ago she had her last child but that info matters too. Your body doesn't just go back to how it was.\n\nYou're all concerned about her physical health but you really are lacking in care for her mental health.\n\nYTA.", "YTA for making it about her weight and not her health. You can tell someone you want them to be healthier, for all the reasons you stated, without telling them you want them to lose weight. Weight does not directly correlate to health for everyone- bodies are different, especially after having children and while being on meds", "YTA. You didn't address your concern as actual health - like moving more, better eating habits - you explicitly framed it as \"you need to lose weight\". You can lose weight and still be unhealthy! You can be fat and healthy! It's not 1-1. Your hereditary health risks aren't hers.", "I think unless ASKED, or a real health concern pops up, or she is 500+lb and can't walk anymore it wasn't your place to say it. Especially the lack of tact and remorse for her feelings. Like yes, you should be able to have a rational conversation with your partner but feelings aren't always rational. She probably feels ugly and alone. You probably destroyed her confidence if not her love for you as well. I know if someone told me this, I would never want to be naked in front of them again.
