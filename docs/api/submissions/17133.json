He then turned around and scolded me , saying \"I asked you if they were vegan!\" I responded with \"You absolutely did not!\" He said that by asking if they were something he could have he was obviously asking if they were made with animal products. I told him that I answered the question as he asked it and it never occurred to me that he wanted to know about the ingredients. He acted like I was being deliberately obtuse and so I told him that his diet is not my responsibility and that he needs to directly ask and not assume that people will guess.

He needs to be responsible for his own diet - and his own poor choice of words in this scenario.", "NTA, I would maybe get it if he was a strict vegan, but if he cheats and fluctuates, then I don't get why he's throwing such a fit.

That's weird and confusing, even to my friends who are more familiar with my restrictions. It is not their responsibility to keep track of my dietary needs, and while they often cook things i can eat because theyre nice, i would never assume that of them.

If he was so concerned about the ingredients he should have directly asked.\n\n I have a small allergy to peppers. I can eat bell peppers sometimes with only a small reaction, but jalapenos are much worse for me. Haven't tried other peppers cause I'm too scared the reaction might be bigger than I expect (especially now that I'm pregnant again) so if I eat with family and there's something that might have peppers in it I ask who made/brought it what's in it. Because that's what adults do.", "Not police, inform. It's pretty obvious what he was asking.", "Yeah, that's a poor choice of wording for sure. I ask \"Is this gluten-free?\" (and then \"what are the ingredients?\" because gluten hides in a lot of things people don't think it does), and I would never use what this friend did because it's not a clear question at all.", "With people I don't know, I'm very specific in my questions.\n\nWith family, friends and co-workers who know my restriction? Not so much. Consider her co-worker who made the cookies was shocked by it I think it's probably well known in the office what he does or does not eat.", "No, it's not. But in this case OP *did* know.", "In the UK pigs in blankets are unusually sausages wrapped in bacon, normally mini sausages", "Not at all obvious. He saw some cookies on a coworker's desk and asked if he could have one, which is a polite thing to do, rather than just grabbing something off someone's desk. OP was not obliged to ask if he was considering himself to be vegan on that particular day.", "OP knows that this coworker is not vegan, because he eats animal products even though he chooses to label himself a vegan for some reason. OP is not obliged to know whether on this particular day, this particular dude was feeling like being vegan.", "It doesn\u2019t matter whether you know someone\u2019s dietary requirements or not. It is always that person\u2019s responsibility to check whether they can eat something clearly and directly. \u201cAllowed\u201d is asking if a person can have one, not if it is safe for them to eat. Expecting people to keep track of what everyone else eats and when, whether or not they know, is unreasonable, as is expecting people to interpret the use of a word incorrectly.\n\nIn this particular instance, OP also knew that the guy in question sometimes breaks his vegan diet. And the guy asked if he was allowed to have one *after* being told they were being passed out for lunch, which supports the understanding of allowed as being about having one then. But in any case, why should OP have to figure all this out for the guy? He should have just asked the question.", "Op also knows he eats milk chocolate"]}
