Since then she has had a second child as well. \n\nI recently inherited the property as well as a relatively large inheritance. You might be wondering why this was given to me instead of my sister. Growing up, I always had a closer relationship with my grandpa than my sister, I made the effort to travel out into the country to visit him, we had more in common etc, whereas he and my sister only really spoke at family gatherings and she only contacted him when she needed something e.g a place to live. She was always prioritised by our parents and her poor life choices were always excused (lots of alcoholism, stealing, and she was racist sometimes). She has always acted entitled towards my things and now this is another example. \n\nI want to Air B&B my new property for extra income, and can\u2019t do that with her living there. I am also childfree.

It's not like you just threw her out.   \n\n\nBut I have to wonder what makes you so adamant about making it into a Air B&B instead of charging her the full rent or something, when you mentioned you got a significant sum of money as well?

Is it because she's not really respecting the property or causing some kind of issue with the property/tenancy?", "YTA - I mean OP, you would be N T A if it wasn't for the dripping hatred you have for your sister.

I hope you are ready to loose contact with your family over this.", "NTA Your sister's past behavior has shown her to be a poor candidate as a tenant and honestly, the longer she stays the more she will entrench herself and the more family will think she somehow deserves to stay forever (as if it is her home rather than yours) and so the more they will see you as \"evil\" for kicking her out. Better to do it now and get it out of the way. It will only get harder to get her out of there.\n\nYou don't need to subsidize her life. She needs to start making better choices and building a better life for herself. She can pay the standard amount of rent somewhere else; your parents can always help her to do that.

You're well within your legal rights, but displacing a family to turn the house into just another airbnb when you're not exactly in dire financial straits is pretty scummy. You're contributing to the housing crisis just to try and make even more money. You're already a landlord and an heir. Isn't that enough?", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s a reason you inherited it.

You could carry that on, but you have no real obligation to. He probably went along with it because he knew his time was short and he could help her in this way.

He left you the house because you're responsible. He let her live there for the time being because she's irresponsible.\n\nYour parents came to you with a decent solution but it is best to get her out of there.

I'm going to guess no...", "ESH/YTA, can't decide. \n\nYou haven't given us any good reason why you're throwing your family onto the streets, other than you want to air bnb it. \n\nAside from the obvious, \"you're an Airbnb asshole\" who is taking good homes off the market because you're too lazy to sell or rent, it doesn't really seem you're in need of any money and you have a perfectly viable tenant already moved in.\n\nNow had you said:\n\"Now that I own the home and I have to pay to run it, I'm going to start charging her rent.\" I'd say that's completely fair. and if you also said, \"she refuses to pay rent and wants to live in my house for free.\" I'd say that you have every right to evict her.\n\nIn either case, I do believe your sister and her kids should have every opportunity to stay, so long as it's a fair deal. I think you're simply being out of line because clearly you're just looking for an excuse to kick them out into the real world where they will probably fail and resent you for it.", "NTA - As mentioned by other people, renting it to her could be a big mistake. If she does start having the problems that other people mentioned (not paying for things, breaking things, etc etc.) and you need to evict her, LEGALLY, which is time consuming and expensive and all round would just be a nightmare. Once she starts paying you for rent and there is a contract, she has rights. If this is in the UK, then as it stands currently she doesn't have the same rights as a renter, you can kick her out with reasonable notice (you've given her 3 months which is plenty)", "So ignoring the fact you chose to become not only a parasite landlord but one that hoards perfectly good family homes for airbnbs on top of it which already makes you a giant ass.\n\nNo where in there did you suggest compromising you don't even bring up the fact of whether or not she was paying rent but instead bring up a list of justifications to try to make yourself sound less bad.\n\nYou just wanted to make as much money on the house as possible at the expense of your family.

Instead his crap dragged on for a little over a year.", "As another devils advocate.\n\n\"4 years rent free\" is being compared to \"didn't get anything\" and not the value of the property.\n\nThe inheritances of \"4 years rent free\" vs \"property\" is based on closer relationship.", "Housing's so bad in my general area, that one city implemented an empty house tax because certain rich people were buying properties that would sit vacant for months at a time.  Like, rent for a two bedroom basement suite has doubled or more in the last decade, and single bedroom suites cost almost as much. Hell, people are partitioning off parts of their living rooms in apartments and charging ridiculous amounts of money for it.  \n\nOP's not wrong for wanting \"easy\" income, but if there's a housing shortage, people are going to be unhappy that a family home is an AirBnB.", "Unfortunately I live in a tourist area.", "To be fair, landlords supply housing to people that can't afford to buy a property.\n\nthere is a vast difference between owning a couple rental units, and being a corporation sitting on thousands of homes.", "Plenty of AH landlords but just as many AH tenant/renters-goes both ways", "Even landlords provide more of a service - as a tenant, you don't have to put a massive amount of money up front, you're more able to pick up and move if and when you want to, maintenance is someone else's problem, etc., etc.\n\nAirbnbs are just a monument to late stage capitalism, where property is doing absolutely nothing useful for anyone but some tool whose only virtue is having money. They're not cheaper than hotels anymore and it's fast moved away from just renting out your home when you go on holiday.\n\nPeople being homeless or unable to find housing in an area where homes sit empty for 80% of the year is just disgusting.", "It may be an illegal one depending on where they live. Many, many municipalities are creating legislature around STRs (especially ones that are not shared with owners or LTTs) and the eviction of long term tenants to create STRs and a lot of people don\u2019t even realize that it\u2019s been created. The town that I just moved down had a crackdown on them and many many people ended up with tickets and extraordinary fines because of it.", "Tbh the people who need help/ support to get their life back on track often aren\u2019t the easiest people to help. If sister was a responsible, upstanding citizen, then odds are she wouldn\u2019t need family help right now. \n\nAgain, OP isn\u2019t legally obligated, and idk exactly what I would do their situation/ how much sister has hurt them in the past. But at the very least they have nieces/ nephews who are about to be in the system if they evict them. It\u2019s setting those kids up for a life of trauma, higher possibility of physical and sexual abuse, trauma related mental illness, higher likelihood to settle into relationships with domestic abuse. Idk I might be sensitive to it bc my partner was raised in the system but I can\u2019t imagine wanting to do that to anyone, let alone my own nieces/nephews, let alone for some passive income that I don\u2019t even need\u2026 \n\nIf they were homeless already OP wouldn\u2019t be obligated to buy them a house but at this point OP didn\u2019t work for the house at all, for all we know they\u2019ve put $0 and 0 sweat into this house. The sister, who has been living there, might have been putting in money and labor to maintain the place. Maybe she hasn\u2019t and has trashed the place, we don\u2019t know. So in this case, since it would cost them nothing out of pocket to keep their nieces/nephews housed\u2026 idk doesn\u2019t it give you a slimy feeling? Like thinking about doing it makes you feel a little gross? To me, that feeling is my moral indicator and in this case it goes bad bad bad, but I do understand that we may not have full context here/ people have different moral indicators. \n\nI also don\u2019t think 3 months is a long time tbh. If she has been living rent free and now needs other accommodations, that might take a while to get in place, might have to apply for gov assistance which can take years etc. most people have minimal ability to truly change their income/ expense equation in 3 months, and finding affordable housing can also take time. \n\nI think OP came here for a community to rally and say you don\u2019t owe anyone else anything and then feel guilt free doing this. I just won\u2019t buy in/ support that narrative.", "I didn\u2019t say it was a problem, it\u2019s more of a \u201cgood luck with that\u201d her Airbnb could thrive but it could fail and she still kicked her sister for some shit that was a bad idea to begin with", "maybe he knew OP was the more \"responsible adult\" out of the two sisters and expected her to  take care of her sister and his kids. by the way OP describes her family, I think it's fair to assume her grandpa probably thought the same way as the other relatives.", "[removed]", "If all the landlords disappeared tomorrow, the houses would still be there, so how do they supply housing?", "Fully agree, there are asshole landlords but being a landlord doesn\u2019t make someone an asshole \u2014 like you said, we need them.\n\nThere is also a vast difference, though, between a landlord supplying housing and someone like OP who only wants to host guests.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
