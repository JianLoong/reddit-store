She's comfortable in revealing clothes which I'm not all that comfortable with but it's not my business so I try not to say anything. \n\nSo I (29M) invited my girlfriend to come with me to my brother's wedding in my home town. I don't live there anymore and live in a place where it doesn't get really cold which is great because it can get to be really freezing this time of year in my hometown. \n\nMy girlfriend agreed and while we were packing I told her multiple times she should buy something to cover herself up because it will be really cold and she wouldn't be able to wear her usual clothes. She said ok and said she's add the clothes. I had to fly out early since I was in the wedding party so I asked her if it was fine and she said it was and she'd fly out by herself.\n\nWell I fly home and have a good time with my family. My girlfriend texts me she's coming the next day and I get ready to pick her up. I go to the airport and I see her wearing a crop top with shorts freezing her ass off. I asked her why she wasn't wearing something warmer and she told me she thought I was 'joking'. I wasn't\n\nSo we go to the hotel I'm staying at and while she's warming up I decide to do something nice and unpack her suitcase. And what I find is that there isn't a single thing in her suitcase that is appropriate in the weather. Everything was really short, and wouldn't keep her warm at all. \n\nThe next day I go to my mother's house to introduce her and everything is well and good until she asks to use my jacket. Remember that I only have one. I don't want her to be cold so I give it to her and while she's warm I'm freezing but don't say anything. This happens over and over. I ask her if she would just buy a jacket or ask someone else but she said its a waste seeing as she won't use the jacket and she doesn't know any one. I'm angry and we get into an argument where finally she agreed to buy a jacket. \n\nOnto the conflict: It's the day before the wedding and it's really freezing. I'm having a good time while she's chatting with my sisters and then she comes up to me and asks to use my jacket. I'm fed up of being cold all the time so I tell her no and it isn't my fault she's cold when I told her to get warm clothes. She's angry and tries to convince me otherwise but when it doesn't work she flies home. I stay and celebrate my brother and his wife before returning home. It's been a week since and she won't respond to my texts.

She can check the weather app.", "Nope NTA. If it was a one time thing like just at the airport arriving okay sure let her borrow your jacket once.

The whole giving someone your jacket thing is only cute if it\u2019s every once in awhile. This scenario is mind boggling levels of ill preparedness and/or stubbornness; was this some sort of weird test? What happened with the jacket she had bought? I hate being cold so it\u2019s hard for me to imagine not doing everything in my power to make sure I\u2019m warm.", "NTA, I'm sure, as most people do, she was capable of googling the weather of your destination.   Let her go out and but a coat.", "NTA", "NTA, but usually if someone from a warmer climate goes to a winter climate without a jacket someone inevitably asks if they want to borrow one.  Or being her bf you could have asked someone rather than make it all about her not buying one.  Are you sure she had the money to buy a jacket?", "Sounds like this relationship isn't going to last long mate.  \ud83d\ude15", "NTA. She's not very survival-minded, and she likes the feeling of control and safety (for her)  that her pretend helplessness creates. Her idea was that she got to show ownership of her bf by wearing his pre-warmed jacket, and that she got to look cute and helpless.\n\nTo be fair, a lot of women like that will assume that men don't get cold. Or hungry. Or tired. And because some men are willing to put on a facade of impervious strength, and thus to play the \"protector of the helpless gf\" game, this might work out well if the two sorts of people get together.\n\nBut it's not a game that works well for very long, or under any kind of difficult situation. An adult woman has to take some kind of responsibility in a relationship with an adult man; it can't be all one-way.\n\nYou told her that you didn't want to play her game, and she didn't wise up and do something different, so that both of you could have fun. So sad for her.", "[deleted]", "NAH. It just sounds like a problematic match. \n\nYou clearly harbor opinions about how she dresses. You are entitled to feel that way, but it may not be a good match if you don\u2019t like how she likes to look. \n\nLots of women like the interaction that is wearing sexy things with their husband/boyfriend\u2019s big fluffy coat on top. She\u2019s not immature for liking that. Some guys like being the one with their jacket on a sexy girl. You just don\u2019t sound like you like that. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you - I hate being cold. \nThis reminds me of the scene in Clueless where  Christian put the pillow on Cher\u2019s feet to keep them warm.", "No, not the AITA\n\nshe flew back before an event that's important and she agreed to and that's a big red flag imho and then she ghosts on you\n\nyou sure you want a relationship with someone doing that to you? I'd be pissed off personally but you are def not the ah", "NTA She *did* make plans for warm clothing -- your jacket. This is obvious. She never planned on buying anything because in her mind you would always hand over your jacket when she needed it and so she didn't have to go through the inconvenience of carrying around clothing that she didn't want to wear at the time. Her convenience outweighs your comfort.\n\nThe fact that she didn't care that you would then be cold is a mark against her character, especially as she refused to get the point and was offended when you finally made her face the consequences of her own actions by refusing to play along and be cold instead of her yet again.\n\nIn her mind her making you be cold on a regular basis is nothing and something she refuses to even acknowledge, while you letting her be cold even once is worthy of anger and hurt to the point of her going home early.", "NTA\n \nWell damn Jackie I can\u2019t control the weather", "NTA.

How is that \u201ccontext\u201d relevant? \n\nI can understand her not wanting to spend money for something she had no use for. Especially if she had already stretched her budget buying a plane ticket or even just taking time off work or whatever. Usually folks in cold weather places have more than one coat. In my family, someone would have lent her one. We\u2019ve actually faced a similar scenario with an out of town guest before, and he had his choice of coats to borrow.
