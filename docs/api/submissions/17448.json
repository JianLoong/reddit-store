Having age restrictions/age filters for young kids when accessing the internet largely unsupervised is super important (imo not sure if allowing young children to access the internet at all without supervision is wise).

That would never make you the asshole, and you sound like you talk to your sister in a very constructive way.\n\nI also don't understand why your mother was upset. You helped your sister use an account that would be more appropriate for her, your sister didn't seem to care, and your mom wouldn't have to worry about her accessing any mature content. Your mom made this into a big deal when she could have just \"oh okay\" and moved on. Your mother is the asshole for making this such a big deal, and for giving you the cold shoulder.

Kids just end up watching bad stuff on youtube--I did it, and I'm sure the majority of the younger folks on this website have had a similar experience.
