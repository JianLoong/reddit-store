Having age restrictions/age filters for young kids when accessing the internet largely unsupervised is super important (imo not sure if allowing young children to access the internet at all without supervision is wise). Even just on an app like YouTube there\u2019s a ton of content that isn\u2019t suitable for children, and some of it is downright creepy.", "NTA.\n\nThe father could use that against your mom. It could actually be a very easy custody-win for him as more than likely she is neglecting the little sister in other areas as well. Sad really...", "NTA and lol at your mom for getting out-parented, out-logic'd, and pissy at a teenager.\n\nAs for you... good work. Keep an eye on your sister.  Your mom's not going to.", "NTA. Your mum just can't handle that you have more parental sense than her.", "NTA, your mom feels threatened by your maturity level and that's exactly why she reacted that way. You are 100% right", "NTA- Highest of fives, big sister! You explained everything in a way little sis could understand and respect. You got her into an age appropriate account. You\u2019re rocking the big sister role. Keep that energy up.", "Ooof. OP you're definitely NTA.\n\nYou are correct that it's important to make sure kids are consuming media appropriate for their age. And good for you for explaining why to your sister and coming up with a solution yourself.\n\nJust as it's not your sister's fault that your mom is not a good parent, it's also not your fault. You are still a child, but more mature and responsible than her. Good for you for doing right by your sister. Keep reminding her that you guys are on the same team and you care about her.\n\nI also don't think an 8 year old should have unlimited access to a phone!", "Your mom is right, you were parenting your sister. But you're still NTA. You're parenting her because your mother isn't. It always makes me sad when I hear or see kids having to parent their siblings, but you're just trying to do what's best for her. That would never make you the asshole, and you sound like you talk to your sister in a very constructive way.\n\nI also don't understand why your mother was upset. You helped your sister use an account that would be more appropriate for her, your sister didn't seem to care, and your mom wouldn't have to worry about her accessing any mature content. Your mom made this into a big deal when she could have just \"oh okay\" and moved on. Your mother is the asshole for making this such a big deal, and for giving you the cold shoulder. Also, for not explaining things to your sister. Your sister should've been told by her mother that it's not her fault, not just you.", "Your Mom is correct that you shouldn't be parenting your sister ... Because you shouldn't have to. Good thing you are looking out for your sister, she's going to need you it seems, maybe remind your mom of her duties to be a responsible adult towards your sister. NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s also bad parent to you, so there\u2019s that", "NTA- Sounds like your mom\u2019s embarrassed. A simple \u201cthanks for looking out for your sister\u201d would\u2019ve sufficed. You saw something inappropriate and steered your sibling in the right direction, nothing wrong with that at all", "NTA but wtf is your mother trying to do??? she is angered because you won't let your little 8 years old sister watch extremely inappropriate videos on the internet???", "NTA.
