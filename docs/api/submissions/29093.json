{"id": 29093, "submission_id": "179v0ro", "title": "AITA for purposefully \"ruining\" my gf's date night?", "selftext": "I (28M) have been going out with this girl (26F) since St. Patrick's Day in March. It's the best relationship I've ever been in and it's starting to get serious, so I've been considering everything about this girl for the future. She's kind, family oriented, thoughtful, funny and, of course, beautiful.\n\nThe only thing about her is that she can't handle things going bad/not as planned. \nI bump my arm against a countertop? Hyperventilating.\nI tell her I have a bad day? Crying.\nMy food isn't as good as I hoped? She offers her food \u00d7100 times and is quiet as a mouse\nGrocery bill is high? Panic attack.\n\nTwo recent events have got me wondering if I can deal with this for the rest of my life.\nWe took a trip and missed our train and she starts crying in the middle of the station....only to find out it was behind us and were facing the wrong direction.\n\nAnd this event in question.\nI wanted to treat her to a day all about her. I cooked her breakfast in bed, took her on her favorite walkway after Starbucks, signed us up for a cooking class, then lunch, shopping for a new bracelet, dinner and at the end of the night, a movie.\n\nThat's when I got an idea.\n\nWhen I bought the tickets, I accidentally bought the wrong day. I called them up and they credited my account for 2 free tickets and I booked another for today....which I keep to myself. (I DID NOT plan this date specifically to \"test\" her, if I booked the right day originally, this never would have happened)\n\nWe finish everything and head to the movies and that's when I realize I accidentally bought the wrong day and show her the receipt for this day, so we can't see the movie, she thinks.\n\nShe responded like I thought she would. Says that's fine, holding back tears and clenching her jaw, won't talk to me, won't even remotely consider that we can go to the desk or see another movie. Nothing. Just immediate giving up. Everything is ruined.\n\nAt that point, I had enough and asked her what she wanted to do and she said let's just go home. I know she didn't mean it, but I did it anyway, so we drove home in silence, like the whole day meant nothing.\n\nShe finally asks me if I'm mad. I say yes and break the news that I had two tickets and planned this to see how she'd react because I don't know if I can deal with this level of panic that she has over the smallest irregularity.\n\nThat was last Saturday and all my male friends agree with me and most of my female coworkers and friends agree too, but also seeing her side.\nAITA for ruining my gf's date night?\n\nEdit: Multiple comments bringing this up. Of course I have brought up how she handles things not going well/according to plan before. We've had this talk multiple times and I'm in therapy for depression and anxiety, so I would never judge her for going, but that's up to her.\n\nEDIT 2: Seems like you people can't read, because I'm still getting this comment over and over and over and over, so let's try again:\nI.

How did she react when you told her you had lied to her and set her up?", "If you don't like your relationship, you can exit it without tests.  If you are uncertain, you can weigh things without tests.  Tests are immature and cruel.", "Info: You put \"ruining\" in quotation marks, but you don't say at what point she said the night was ruined. \n\n>She responded like I thought she would. Says that's fine, holding back tears and clenching her jaw, won't talk to me, won't even remotely consider that we can go to the desk or see another movie. Nothing. Just immediate giving up. Everything is ruined.\n\nIs this when she said the whole night was ruined? The only thing you quote her saying is \"that's fine\". When you say she wouldn't talk to you, or consider those options, were you suggesting those options? What were you saying that she wasn't responding to? Or were you both just standing in silence?\n\n>At that point, I had enough and asked her what she wanted to do and she said let's just go home.\n\nThe way you tell the story it seems like this is your first actual interaction since telling her the tickets were wrong and you couldn't see the movie.

I say yes and break the news that I had two tickets and planned this to see how she'd react because I don't know if I can deal with this level of panic that she has over the smallest irregularity.\n\nIf there was silence after the decision to go home, and then this conversation, it really doesn't sound like she ever called the day ruined.\n\nAt least, not before this point, where you told her you were testing her. That could well have ruined the whole day.", "So you set your girlfriend up, by tricking and lying to her, and then decided the date was \u201cruined\u201d because she reacted exactly the way your trick was meant to provoke her?\n\nThere are two problems as I see it: firstly whether or not you could cope with what you clearly think are your girlfriend\u2019s flaws. Secondly that, while complaining about her lack of maturity, you thought that lying, deceiving and deliberately triggering her anxiety was the mature, rational and acceptable way to deal with it. \n\nThe first is understandable, and you\u2019re using that to justify the second. You\u2019re conflating two things to absolve your own cruel, immature and unkind actions. You might have \u201cproven\u201d that she doesn\u2019t handle the unexpected well, but you\u2019ve also proven that you aren\u2019t a trustworthy partner. I suspect that your girlfriend knows how you think about her and that\u2019s why she hasn\u2019t accepted any \u201chelp\u201d from you. Can\u2019t say I blame her. \n\nYTA. She deserves better.", "YTA. You're a grown man, just fucking talk to her about the issue and how the two of you could resolve it. It very much sounds like she has some kind of anxiety issue or lacks coping mechanisms or something and probably needs some therapy to address it. Playing games to set it off is cruel. If you want a relationship without this kind of drama, don't deliberately add to it. You're an adult. Act like one.", "YTA. it wasnt a \"test\". you already knew how she would react, so you were basically just screwing with her. not nice.\n\nsounds like she is too neurotic to function and needs professional help", "YTA. You knew what the outcome was going to be. YOU ruined the day not her. She reacts emotionally to things going wrong and you decided to plan a wonderful day then cause a negative emotional reaction on purpose.\n\nI used to panic when things went wrong and frantically try to fix/solve them. It's because I grew up in an abusive home where every small inconvenience caused my dad to fly off the handle. I'm a lot better now but it took me a long time to work through the panic I felt. \n\nHave you had an actual conversation with her about why small things make it so hard for her? How are you reacting when something happens? If you can't handle it then that's fine but don't make it harder for her.", "Why do people date people they hate?", "YTA, you're her partner not her parent. You shouldn't be testing her. If you don't like how she acts, communicate and if things don't change, break up.", "YTA for testing her when you knew this would be the outcome. This event will likely only contribute to her panicking more in the future. If you didn\u2019t test her and were just reconsidering the relationship, you would be N T A. Dealing with constant panic/overreaction is not healthy for you in the relationship either. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s likely your girlfriend has had some kind of trauma/may be the victim of abuse if she reacts this strongly to things going wrong. I was like this because of the way I was treated in a previous relationship - I panicked to everything that went wrong because I was worried my current boyfriend was going to punish me the way my ex did. I used to feel horrible that my boyfriend had to deal with it and that made the panicking worse. BUT I went to therapy and it rarely ever happens anymore and I\u2019m super grateful that my boyfriend gave me a chance in our first year (though it would be perfectly reasonable if he had not, my trauma was not his fault, and did not have to put up with it). She is not responsible for what may have happened to her but she is responsible for how she allows that to impact her interpersonal relationships, but you shouldn\u2019t have intentionally led her to another situation where she did this and likely feels more ashamed. \n\nIf you really like this girl, see if you can talk to her about how you feel and discuss the benefits of therapy. You\u2019re both pretty young and she can absolutely come out of this if she works at it. If you feel like it\u2019s too much and it outweighs the benefits of you dating, that\u2019s fine too. Just don\u2019t intentionally do things that you know will make her panic because then things will never work out between the too. Best of luck to you both!", "YTA\n\nShe clearly has issues, and rather than try to talk to her about them or get her help you decided to prod at her to 'test' her limits?\n\nThis could be any number of things, trauma, anxiety, autism, a phobia\n\nI'm autistic and 99% of people have zero idea because it only present in a couple of specific, severe ways. Until a couple of years ago if anything changed, any tiny plan, even something small like having to drive somewhere instead of get the bus or order a different meal at a restaurant, I would feel like a train ran through my chest and I would break down. It's embarrassing, and shameful, and scary to feel your body betray you. If someone had done to me what you did I would not forgive them. Therapy has helped lots, though even now sometimes I will need to go hide in the bathroom and do deep breathing to make the feeling pass\n\nShe needs support, imagine this was a debilitatingly bad spider phobia, instead of finding a therapist you decided to throw a spider at her.", "YTA\n\n> She finally asks me if I'm mad. I say yes and break the news that I had two tickets and planned this to see how she'd react because I don't know if I can deal with this level of panic\n\nThere is no need to test her, you know she over reacts in these situations. You should have talked to her and asked her if there is anything you can do to help calm her nerves in these situations, or suggest she talk to a professional, etc. \n\nIt's fine to not know if you can handle this or not, but testing people isn't a good idea. Just be honest with her and talk to her, she's going to feel like you are messing with her if you test her.", "YTA. You say this is a relationship you see yourself long term in, but you also say your girlfriend's approach to dealing with problems isn't something you can handle. Your own problem solving abilities need examining if you decide you need to test your girlfriend, as nothing seems to be changing beyond the fact she now knows you can test her.", "YTA. YOU LITERALLY SET HER UP TO FAIL!!  You test a pc, a car, a food dish.  You don't test a person, you are literal definition of FAFO.  This could of ended badly.  People can react differently dependant on mood, hormones, chemical, conditioning ect.  Your literally playing stupid games with a person whom you like hopefully love.  This is just so wrong on so many levels.  How is she supposed to trust you in future, how is she supposed to know another situation in the future isn't a test?    Its not big or clever doing what you did!  I am just going to say it men don't test their partners, boys do, grow the hell up\n\nEdit for spelling.", "YTA. \nShe clearly has some issues that require therapy. You knew this. You knew exactly how she would respond, and you went ahead and deliberately triggered her anxiety. You ruined a lovely day. \nNow, I can\u2019t say I\u2019d stick around in the relationship, because I\u2019d always be walking on eggshells to not bother her. But that\u2019s your choice. You can date her, and encourage her to get help, and tolerate her anxiety, or you can leave.", "Personally I would never be with anyone like that, I just couldn't deal with walking on eggshells all the time, and my partner needs to be someone who is going to melt down when things do inevitably go wrong.\nBut testing her like that was truly awful so YTA, most definitely.", "YTA- DON'T TEST YOUR PARTNERS! You say that you and your girlfriend have had multiple talks about these situations and that you yourself are in therapy for anxiety,  but you don't recognize these behaviors that she is exhibiting as anxious behaviors? Some kind of trauma responses? I'm not telling you you have to be her keeper, but why do you think she was just acting this way, a lack of attention? As much as you don't like her acting this way, I guarantee she hates it a hundred times more. \n\nThat all being said, if her behavior was too much for you, or if you didn't feel like she was searching for a way to get better in a time frame that you were comfortable with, you should have just left her. Instead, what you did was awful. You told her you were doing a \"Day Just for Her\" but ended up combining all of her worst fears together and then made her feel like shit all the way home for acting EXACTLY the way you knew she was gonna act. You had no reason to assume she had gotten any better. This just felt like a long drawn out way for you to punish her, because honestly, who does something like this to someone they like?", "YTA. Sounds like she has CPTSD and trauma. She needs therapy and you \u201ctesting\u201d her isn\u2019t helping. Either be supportive and help her through this or break up with her. I also went through a period like your girlfriend where I couldn\u2019t handle anything. I was having panic attacks and PTSD flashbacks all the time and could barely function. Thank god my husband supported me and helped me through it or I\u2019d probably have killed myself. She needs help, not a lesson.", "YTA\n\nIt frankly doesn\u2019t matter if her reactions are reasonable or normal. You know how she is, you deliberately set up a situation that would cause her distress, this is an asshole thing to do. That\u2019s what you did. You did something you *knew* would deeply upset her, on purpose. Doing things on purpose to upset people is cruel and asshole behavior.", "YTA. You could, I don't know, have had an adult talk with her about how this is your hill to die on and either ended it amicably or she would have.\n\nAs a person who has CPTSD from an abusive ex, I had similar reactions because whenever things would go wrong, they would take it out on me. Have you ever talked to her about WHY she has such strong reactions?", "Oh god don\u2019t you hate when someone come here to ask AITA and get angry when people actually think they are\u2026. If you are just looking to validate yourself just don\u2019t post here honestly.", "YTA. 'Testing' someone's response with a manufactured situation is just dishonest and pathetic.  Clearly your gf has a problem: whether it's a Nature or a Nurture thing, it can probably be corrected with some therapy or at a minimum  - some deep-dive conversations about 'why' she handles things the way she does, and what her better options are. Not everyone has the same Life-Experience and has learned the same lessons on how to handle every situation. She has some more personal development to do. Torturing her is not the way to get her there. Shame on you, you can be better.", "YTA\n\nI can't think of any time a contrived relationship 'test' was a good idea.\n\nYou lied and manipulated a situation you knew would upset your partner.\n\nThere's no need to construct situations.  Just address it directly when it happens naturally.\n\nYou're TA because you purposely planned to upset your partner.  She would be TA if it happened organically and she flipped out at you after a full day of planned activities going well.", "You tested her for something you already knew the answer to. Way to go AH.", "YTA\n\nLook, I get that you probably wanted to see where this was going to go, but I think you already knew. You gave plenty of examples before the \u201ctest\u201d scenario. \n\nI think you need to realise that this is actually her, it\u2019s also a significant part of where she is at and how she manages the world. Having a situation manipulated by you to specifically highlight her personal weakness and \u201ctest\u201d her reaction is pretty unpleasant, some might even consider it somewhat cruel. Most people would object to someone they care about manipulating a situation to specifically bring out an unpleasant emotional reaction, surely you can see that. \n\nYou know how she manages disappointment, you have witnessed quite a few times. It would have been much kinder to simply let her know you are not compatible in an area that is important to you and end the relationship wishing her all the best as she does have some lovely qualities. \n\nPerhaps you next girlfriend can manipulate a scenario to test your level of empathy, compassion or \u201ccruelty towards others\u201d or perhaps your level of maturity in how you simply relate to others?", "NTA for knowing you don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with someone who gets so disregulated over inconveniences and irregularities (0% chance I could handle that either) \n\nYTA for triggering her knowing it would happen. You need to cut your losses and breakup with her if she\u2019s not going to therapy.", "She's anxious. She sounds like she may have been bullied or victimised.\n\nAnd you decided to make a fuck up of yours into a \"test\" for this anxious person who you claim to care about.\n\nYou already know the answer.\n\nYTA.", "bro you KNEW this would be triggering for your girl, YTA", "You have played with her and you are asking if you are asshole? YTA.\n\nAsk yourself if you want to live like that and ask her if she wants to change that part of her. But be adult about that, maybe use this situation as example \"things can go differently than planned and that's not the end of the world\" BUT BE ADULT.", "YTA for this test... It was cruel and unnecessary. You already knew how it would go. If you wanted to help her, way better way would be to show her how to deal with the problem. You could have proposed going and buying tickets to something else, going somewhere else, or somehow trying to save the evening, then she would see that a small mistake doesn't have to ruin everything.\n\nIf you struggle with her problem and despite talking she refuses to do something about it then you need to break up with her, not play games with her mind. Or maybe try one last time and tell her she'll either start working on it by attending therapy or you will break up and follow through with it. Doing \"tests\" like you did is cruel.", "YTA you did mean to test her and you're an AH for it. It doesn't sound like she's enjoying the fact that she's fully expectation driven. Crying? Panic attack? Hyperventilating? I feel bad for her and I wonder why you don't and instead feel like you have to \"deal\" with it. It doesn't seem like she's taking any of her emotions out on you at all just having a strong reaction to her own disappointment when plans go awry. Talking to her about getting therapy to build healthy coping mechanisms when things go wrong is the mature response and talking to her like she's a human being about the fact that you feel she deserves to have good quality of life and the possible disappointment you may feel that you have to end the night early is appropriate. Treating her like some petulant child and testing her is not. Being a human is tough, I've definitely cried when I've missed trains before and then got myself back together 5 minutes later. \n\nYou aren't required to \"deal\" with anything but if you loved her I don't see why your first reaction would be to test her and not to help her.", "YTA for sure, but man she sounds exhausting.", "Looks like you\u2019re not the right person who can be there for her unconditionally.

And you want us to believe your pikachu-shocked-face when she reacted exactly the way you knew she would? It\u2019s almost crueler that you planned out a nice, easygoing day, only to deliberately throw a wrench into it right at the end just to upset her.

It's the best relationship I've ever been in and it's starting to get serious, so I've been considering everything about this girl for the future. She's kind, family oriented, thoughtful, funny and, of course, beautiful.\n\nThe only thing about her is that she can't handle things going bad/not as planned. \nI bump my arm against a countertop? Hyperventilating.\nI tell her I have a bad day? Crying.\nMy food isn't as good as I hoped? She offers her food \u00d7100 times and is quiet as a mouse\nGrocery bill is high? Panic attack.\n\nTwo recent events have got me wondering if I can deal with this for the rest of my life.\nWe took a trip and missed our train and she starts crying in the middle of the station....only to find out it was behind us and were facing the wrong direction.\n\nAnd this event in question.\nI wanted to treat her to a day all about her. I cooked her breakfast in bed, took her on her favorite walkway after Starbucks, signed us up for a cooking class, then lunch, shopping for a new bracelet, dinner and at the end of the night, a movie.\n\nThat's when I got an idea.\n\nWhen I bought the tickets, I accidentally bought the wrong day. I called them up and they credited my account for 2 free tickets and I booked another for today....which I keep to myself. (I DID NOT plan this date specifically to \"test\" her, if I booked the right day originally, this never would have happened)\n\nWe finish everything and head to the movies and that's when I realize I accidentally bought the wrong day and show her the receipt for this day, so we can't see the movie, she thinks.\n\nShe responded like I thought she would. Says that's fine, holding back tears and clenching her jaw, won't talk to me, won't even remotely consider that we can go to the desk or see another movie. Nothing. Just immediate giving up. Everything is ruined.\n\nAt that point, I had enough and asked her what she wanted to do and she said let's just go home. I know she didn't mean it, but I did it anyway, so we drove home in silence, like the whole day meant nothing.\n\nShe finally asks me if I'm mad. I say yes and break the news that I had two tickets and planned this to see how she'd react because I don't know if I can deal with this level of panic that she has over the smallest irregularity.\n\nThat was last Saturday and all my male friends agree with me and most of my female coworkers and friends agree too, but also seeing her side.\nAITA for ruining my gf's date night?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You just managed to make her even more anxious for any future dates. By like a lot.", "You know she is bad in those situations and you NEVER offered to exchange tickets, buy new ones or anything at all. I get VERY stressed when I have to travel. My husband knows it so we work TOGETHER to mitigate that and even if I lash out he knows why and he HELPS. YTA and next level AH.", "\u201cit\u2019s movie tickets, bro\u201d.

You\u2019re a dick. lol.", "Why did you even post here if you aren\u2019t going to actually take in any criticisms?", "You did something shitty. You may not have known the extent of what her reaction would be, but you knew the situation would upset her and you created that situation on purpose. That was a shitty thing to do. That\u2019s what people are trying to tell you. That\u2019s why YTA. If you\u2019re incapable of accepting a response you weren\u2019t expecting, you shouldn\u2019t have posted at all. And if you react this defensively when she gets upset, your behavior is a problem too.", "You don\u2019t know her trauma or how deep it goes, but you are aware of her triggers, and you unleashed her triggers. You\u2019re supposed to be her safe space. You\u2019re not compatible so let her go.", "The fact that NOBODY is saying otherwise than YTA says enough... it's rare to have a unanymous verdict and you've just got one so put down your defense mechanism, actually READ and try to understand what everyone is typing out so you can see the situation from a different point of view and be mature about it. You're arguing with literally everyone like we are attacking you personally instead of making a verdict objectively. Let that sink in.", "It's Reddit, people will judge you. I understand what you're saying, but whining on Reddit that your gf is weird is not the answer. \n\nEvery person has two sides, it's your job decide whatever she worths the trouble or not. \n\nAsking random Reddit weirdos who don't know you nor your girl is like me asking the local crackhead wether crypto is good or not. \n\nBe a man, figure it out your self.", "This doesn't prove anything because it actually makes way more sense for a large group of people to be right than just 1 individual. This comment didn't make you sound any more intelligent in the process. All this shows is that you can count to 4.", "It is not for you to decide if it is a big deal for her or not.\n\nWould it be a big deal for me if my husband got the wrong day ticket? Absolutely not. But if he knowingly put me in a situation where I feel anxious or bad and let me deal with it just to test me I would absolutely be mad at him.\n\nYes her reaction to this event is extreme, but it does not change the fact that what you did was not a nice move. If you decide that her reactions are too much for you and you don\u2019t want to be a relationship with her because of it then fine that\u2019s your choice. But if you love her and want to get serious with her you will have to work together not against each other.", "Why even ask AITA if you\u2019ve already made up your mind that you\u2019re not and will fight anyone who says otherwise? It sounds likely to me that your friends have only agreed with you because you\u2019ve bullied your point across and refuse to hear anyone disagreeing with you on this. \n\nAsking if you\u2019re a TA is a matter of opinion, not fact, so saying \u201cif the whole internet says 2+2=5 they\u2019re wrong\u201d doesn\u2019t actually apply here.\n\nLike people have said before, you knew this situation would stress your girlfriend out and instead of giving her a perfect day like she wanted, you decided to \u201ctest her\u201d for something you know she hasn\u2019t been working on (so what even was the point in your test???) \n\nIn case you were wondering, in my opinion, YTA.", "No one is saying it's a reasonable reaction. As someone with an anxiety disorder I can tell you that irrational feelings can't be stopped just by realizing they're irrational. Her feelings are real whether they're warranted or not. And purposely upsetting your partner is a dick move.

Obviously", "That's not what addressing mental health means. It is not **possible** for **you** to address **her** mental health. \n\nThere is a reason the commenter said \"her for not addressing her mental health\"", "Honey I am 40. Don't call me kiddo. Just live with the fact that YTA", "We finish everything and head to the movies and that's when I realize I accidentally bought the wrong day and show her the receipt for this day, so we can't see the movie, she thinks.\n\nShe responded like I thought she would. Says that's fine, holding back tears and clenching her jaw, won't talk to me, won't even remotely consider that we can go to the desk or see another movie. Nothing. Just immediate giving up. Everything is ruined.\n\nI get your point.. but look at it the way it happened. The mess up happened. But he had overall done so much for her to have a great day.. which she completely forgot about... when he informed her of the mess up she dint ask, tell.. nothing.. assumed she wasn't getting the movie and got teary eyed and stopped talking to him. he hid the truth from her after her reaction. That's probably when he realized it's just not gonna work out and took her home and told her the truth before finishing things up.", "Oh, then just copy and paste the explanation.", "This, 100%", "Yeah that\u2019s why it\u2019s ESH.

Period.\n\nSeeing her reaction to see if she can handle things going wrong when she had so many things going right is very logical. If she can't handle that it's a red flag and needs to be thought out in a relationship.", "No, I didn't. It was an amazing day with a minor inconvenience at the end. She can deal with it.", "I've been doing that the entire time, you people just want an argument", "how so?", "Yea I\u2019d absolutely break up with her. I can\u2019t deal with that anxiety and drama in my life. But giving a \u201ctest\u201d you know she\u2019s gonna fail is unnecessary.", "exactly, it was an example of a different situation where 'but 99% of people would be fine' doesn't stop something from being an AH move", "I agree that it\u2019s not necessary but she terrorizes him so much that she deserves a little comeuppance and a taste of her own medicine. I would have done her way dirtier and break up with her then and there, but i\u2019m also petty", "Because I'm waiting for criticism in a calm, logical manor, not pretending she received life altering news after our tickets are wrong....seem like a low bar, but here you all are...going WAAAAY under it", "She didn't forget about the efforts he made- she clearly has something complicated going on. A healthy person wouldn't respond to their plans being changed like she does and he's fully aware of that. \n\nAnd I'm not saying he doesn't have a right to be annoyed by the situation but what was he expecting by hiding the truth? And why didn't he break things off way sooner if this bothers him so much and he can't deal with it?", "Fucking read the thread! You're the one that made it! Jesus christ, I would be a bundle of nerves if I had to be around you all the time too. Are you generally this helpless? Like a small child?

Good ones too.", "You definitely the asshole.", "I hope so too though I fear her mental health issues will make her believe she doesn't deserve better", "all of your replies show how immature you are. 28? more like a 12yo with too much time", "yeah, you got everything right, except for the part where you \\*don't\\* test her", "Movie tickets gone wrong ARE difficult inconveniences to deal with if she is autistic, for example. You're just not ready to accommodate her issues and/or needs. You only see your own side in this, not hers. And your confrontational demeanor in this comment sections shows how you handle the responsibility being placed on you.", "You already seemed to know she can\u2019t handle even minor things going wrong. So what was the test for? \n\nHer extreme reactions could stem from some sort of trauma in her past. She needs help, not someone who she cares about deliberately trying to set her off.

It's really that simple. You chose to put someone you claim to care about in that situation. That isn't how you treat anyone , much less a partner.\nYou honestly come across as a horrid person who doesn't really care and it's completely obvious you aren't here for a verdict, so WHY are you here?", "Whoo boy you\u2019re getting dumped. I\u2019d put money on next St. Patrick\u2019s day as the latest expiration date of this relationship. I need to figure out how to do a remind me.\n\nAlso TYPING. LIKE. THIS. MAKES. YOU. LOOK.

But your yourself set up a situation you might not like and then get mad about it being like you assumed it would be? How is that logical?\n\n\nAlso- her telling you it is ok and not wanting to spend money double is not that bad of a reaction. She didn't get angry at you. She literally didn't stop talking to you or how fid she say it is ok and answered you when she asked? \n\n\n\nThe crime your gf commited was literally not looking as happy as you wanted her to. You did completly overreact.", "Exactly! Like what was he even testing? He says she reacted like he expected her to, and he got mad about it even though he orchestrated the situation", "Yeah you sound petty. Glad you are so self aware!", "What the fuck", "Yikes dude. Yuck. Your attitude is garbage. Your girlfriend deserves better than you.", "He got annoyed and took her home. Told her the truth when she asked if he was annoyed and let her know that her recations are not something he is able to deal with. Why dint he break up with her sooner? It's a 8 month old relationship not 8 years.. he tried.", "Yeah I think they are both emotionally immature to the same degree. Except he also has the added quirk of thinking he is better than her.", "Why did you bother typing this comment, which clearly took more time than copy and pasting? oh, because it was never given and you are deflecting \ud83d\udc4d", "If he wasn\u2019t from the post he definitely is based on the comments.

With the way he's replying to comments it doesn't sound like he even liked her at all.", "You're an asshole and hate it so you're taking it out on the people who are telling you what an asshole you are", "It did not take more time than copy and pasting. I\u2019m a quick lil typer. 8-12 seconds max including fixing typos :)\n\nGood try though. Very cute.

That\u2019s literally exactly what you asked for: am \u2014I\u2014 the asshole.\n\nI hate when people misuse this sub and then get mad that they\u2019re getting exactly what they asked for instead of their secret inner wishes or whatever.\n\nYou\u2019re just pissed and deflecting at this point, like pretty much every YTA poster who gets their underwear in a little knot because they had to hear they were wrong and don\u2019t have the maturity or good character to accept it.", "People spend a lot more then 8 months getting to know thier partners before making a decision for future. Also I read through his replies after you mentioned. Looks like he himself is in therapy for depression. And had brought this up with her multiple times  before. I don't think he doesn't like her. I think he isn't dealing with any of it as he should. It's best for this relationship to end. Both are not fit for eachother. Both need help."]}
