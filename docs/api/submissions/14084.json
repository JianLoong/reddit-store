We're having a small, immediate family only ceremony, no fuss, on a weekday, spending a few days in the area, and then on the Saturday having a big party back home with all of our family and friends. By immediate family, I mean literally my parents and sisters and my partner's parents, sister and her fiance (so 4 people per family). However, my older sister has now invited her boyfriend.\n\nThey've been dating officially since November but have known each other for about a year at this point. They're in a long distance relationship and I have never met this man. Not in person, not online, nothing. My side of the family are getting accommodation/ an airbnb around the week of the wedding (since its a rural wedding a bit far away from where they live and we want to make a holiday of it) and now there's talk of him coming and staying in this air bnb. Not to the ceremony, but to this mini holiday. Neither me nor my partner have been asked or consulted, its just talking like this is decided and happening. Neither my sister or her boyfriend are planning on taking annual leave for this, and are planning on remote working during this holiday. \n\nI called my mum to ask her to talk to my sister about it. Both my partner and I are uncomfortable with someone we've never met being around on our wedding day, even if he doesn't come to the ceremony. We invited just family for a reason, and if we were expanding the guest list out there are some friends we'd have rather invited (this is why we're having a big party on another day - so we can invite everyone!). My sister already invited him to the party, and we're happy for him to come - feels like a more appropriate situation to meet him for the first time. My mum said not to get worked up over it, my sister wants to celebrate her relationship too but she'll talk to her about it. I feel dismissed and am wondering if I'm being mean.\n\nI can't control this guy if he does want to come to the same area and have a bit of a holiday before the party (he and my sister live abroad). But I feel like her needs and wants are being placed over mine.
