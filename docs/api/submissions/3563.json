My daughter is 13 and is the single greatest thing to ever happen to me. About a week ago she said that this boy in her class wanted to know if she would be up to grab pizza on that Saturday. We don't really do anything for Thanksgiving so, logistically it worked out. She agreed to it. \n\nWhen she told me about this, I said that I wanted to meet this guy. She immediately got annoyed and asked why. I said that if a guy is asking my daughter out, I just want to be able to put a face to a name. I promised her it was not going to be some goofy \" dad interrogates boyfriend and acts all scary\" schtick. I told her to tell him I wanted to meet him and just say \" Hi\". She tells me she's told him.\n\nSaturday comes and I see her heading towards the door. I tell her to hold up and ask where her date is. She says he's outside and that they're going to bike ride to the pizza place. I ask why he's not coming to the door. She first tells me he's nervous and doesn't know what he'd say to me. I told her that, \" Nice to meet you\" is a good start. Her story changes and she tells me he just \" doesn't see why\" I have to meet him. I reiterate my \"why\" to her and ask her to go get him.\n\nShe breaks down and tells me that she lied to me. She never told him I wanted to meet him because she thought it was \" stupid\" that I wanted to meet him.\n\nI told her to text him that the date was off. She said I wasn't allowed to do that. I asked her again to tell him. She started getting teary eyed, texted him, told me I was mean and that she hated me and went to her room.\n\nWhen I told my sister what'd happened, she thought I was in the wrong and said I should've let my daughter go on the date.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669782944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8hdzk/aita_for_making_my_daughter_cancel_her_date/", "score": 615, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm only 30 and when I was growing up, I wasn't allowed to go anywhere with someone my parents hadn't met. How are you supposed to protect your kids if you don't know who they're spending time with?

I usually don't like parents controlling their children but you made a reasonable choice. I understand that as a parent, your role is to protect them from harm. A lot of creeps are roaming, so she should understand why you wanted to meet the guy first. Unfortunately, young people tend to overlook such scenario.", "NTA. While I understand that kids are afraid of parents embarrassing them etc. I'm wondering why your kid was trying so hard to keep you from meeting the boy? Like is he out of her age bracket or something else she thinks is sketchy? You could have just walked out to meet the kid after your daughter told you she lied to you and skipped the \"tell him to come say hi\" arguing.

At the point she asked you if she could go out with a boy, you should have sat her down and talked about your expectations for her going out with boys.

Talking to her about healthy relationships and what that looks like, for example you wanting to meet the boy and possibly his parents. Curfews or time limits for the date.", "Nah, NTA. At the risk of sounding old, kids these days are just disrespectful. I am not the most socially gift man, I've screwed up parent meets a few times, and I was always an anxious mess when tgat time xame, but I was always respectful enough to do it.\n\nIt sounds like you mostly did everything right. Hindsight being 20/20, but maybe a better approach would have been to tell your daughter she couldn't go until the boy did the proper thing and picked her up to escort her to the pizza joint instead of just telling her she couldn't go.", "NAH\n\nYou have every right to know who you\u2019re daughter is spending time with. He\u2019s only 13, I assume, so it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal to meet him. Then again, she may have lied and he could be 16-17, which would be a whole other set of issues.\n\nYou were clear about your expectations and she chose to go around them. Welcome to having a teen. Next time be upfront about the consequences so there is no confusion.", "NTA. for all you know this guy is 20 years old. No parent in their right mind would let their 13 year old daughter go out on a date with somebody especially after lying about it. I\u2019ve always told my kids (oldest now is 12 and all girls) that they start with the benefit of my trust and I\u2019ll give them a TON of space and room to do what they want and make their own way as long as they\u2019re open about it.

And thanks for being a caring dad.", "NTA, but you could have gone outside to meet him", "NTA but they way you went about it wasnt cool.\n\nShe shouldn't have lied but it's her first date and she's probably scared and nervous and thought this would make her less cool to him.\n\nYou could've went outside to meet him or taken her to the pizza place and met him there. Thats what my parents would've done and not relied on the brains of fresh teens to make smart decisions.\n\nAlso the people who keep talking about his daughter like she had malicious intent?!? Shes 13, heck no shes not gonna make good decisions especially when its comes to things she perceives as embarrassing. But shes not trying to dodge the boy meeting her dad so they can go sell drugs together shes just nervous as heck", "It could be either parent but you don't just let your child disappear with someone you dont know. I think it was a couple of years ago two older boys sent a kid younger to go to a girls house to lure her to the the park. Where two older boys met her and took her to an empty house raped and murdered her. So yeah you meet them", "NTA\n\nshe's 13, she shouldn't be leaving the house with ANYONE that you haven't met, no matter what gender they are. you gave her multiple options and opportunities to introduce this guy to you, and she turned down every one.", "NTA. You were being a good dad by wanting to meet the guy. She is a teen so she is going to keep pushing to see where the line is and what you will do.

She lied to you and then tried to sneak out and the attitude that you're \"not allowed\" to tell her no at 13 makes me think she doesn't understand how rules work and the two of you need to have a talk about boundaries before this happens again.\n\nMy daughter is a little younger, but when she's 13 I think I would do the same thing if she got caught lying to me like this.", "NTA for wanting to meet a kid taking your daughter out, but could you not have just walked outside and met the kid yourself?

For a similar story, a guy I briefly dated in high school who went to a separate school asked me to his school\u2019s prom, I was about 17 or 18 at the time. My parents flipped and said no because they didn\u2019t know who he was and had never met him and weren\u2019t comfortable letting me go. I had to cancel the prom date and I was FURIOUS with my parents, fueled with angsty teen rage. Now as a 26 year old I see it their way, they were just protecting me the way you\u2019re protecting your kid. I think you were perfectly reasonable and responsible in wanting to meet him or at least say hello first. \n\nBut I do feel for your daughter; navigating dating is super hard and confusing, especially as an early teen! Parents are embarrassing and wet blankets. Emotions are out of control, and boys are suddenly the most interesting thing in the world and nobody understands you, especially not your parents, because they don\u2019t get it and never will. (You absolutely could not pay me enough to go back to being 13 if I had the chance \ud83d\ude02). I assume your daughter is bucking up against you \u201ctreating her like a child\u201d (which she is) and trying to figure out what freedom she can have now as a teen, and probably wanting to rush straight ahead into it. (At least, that\u2019s how I felt as a teen when my parents said no to things like this). Also probably disappointment since being asked on a date can be huge for teens her age. But hang in there!!

It sounds like this boy may be.. perhaps older in a predatory manner, and she's afraid because she knows you'll put a stop to it. These are very, very large red flags. \n\nI would level with your daughter, say that there are very scary men out there and that you won't punish her, you just want to feel safe (if you make it about YOU and not her, she's less likely to get defensive). If there's one thing I remember about being 13, it's that further restriction will only distance her. If you're upfront with her and tactful in framing your feelings/perspective, you may reach her. Perhaps also do this while treating her to her favorite dinner as an apology. \n\nShe's not a spoiled brat, but she is potentially involved in something a bit sinister.

She agreed to have the kid come meet her dad so he agreed to the date you have to hold up your end. Not everything with a child should be negotiated especially when there was already an agreement.
