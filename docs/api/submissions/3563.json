My daughter is 13 and is the single greatest thing to ever happen to me. About a week ago she said that this boy in her class wanted to know if she would be up to grab pizza on that Saturday. We don't really do anything for Thanksgiving so, logistically it worked out. She agreed to it. \n\nWhen she told me about this, I said that I wanted to meet this guy. She immediately got annoyed and asked why. I said that if a guy is asking my daughter out, I just want to be able to put a face to a name. I promised her it was not going to be some goofy \" dad interrogates boyfriend and acts all scary\" schtick. I told her to tell him I wanted to meet him and just say \" Hi\". She tells me she's told him.\n\nSaturday comes and I see her heading towards the door. I tell her to hold up and ask where her date is. She says he's outside and that they're going to bike ride to the pizza place. I ask why he's not coming to the door. She first tells me he's nervous and doesn't know what he'd say to me. I told her that, \" Nice to meet you\" is a good start. Her story changes and she tells me he just \" doesn't see why\" I have to meet him. I reiterate my \"why\" to her and ask her to go get him.\n\nShe breaks down and tells me that she lied to me. She never told him I wanted to meet him because she thought it was \" stupid\" that I wanted to meet him.\n\nI told her to text him that the date was off. She said I wasn't allowed to do that. I asked her again to tell him. She started getting teary eyed, texted him, told me I was mean and that she hated me and went to her room.\n\nWhen I told my sister what'd happened, she thought I was in the wrong and said I should've let my daughter go on the date.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669782944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8hdzk/aita_for_making_my_daughter_cancel_her_date/", "score": 9505, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I usually don't like parents controlling their children but you made a reasonable choice. I understand that as a parent, your role is to protect them from harm. A lot of creeps are roaming, so she should understand why you wanted to meet the guy first. Unfortunately, young people tend to overlook such scenario.", "NTA. While I understand that kids are afraid of parents embarrassing them etc. I'm wondering why your kid was trying so hard to keep you from meeting the boy? Like is he out of her age bracket or something else she thinks is sketchy? You could have just walked out to meet the kid after your daughter told you she lied to you and skipped the \"tell him to come say hi\" arguing.

At the point she asked you if she could go out with a boy, you should have sat her down and talked about your expectations for her going out with boys.

Talking to her about healthy relationships and what that looks like, for example you wanting to meet the boy and possibly his parents. Curfews or time limits for the date.", "Nah, NTA. At the risk of sounding old, kids these days are just disrespectful. I am not the most socially gift man, I've screwed up parent meets a few times, and I was always an anxious mess when tgat time xame, but I was always respectful enough to do it.\n\nIt sounds like you mostly did everything right. Hindsight being 20/20, but maybe a better approach would have been to tell your daughter she couldn't go until the boy did the proper thing and picked her up to escort her to the pizza joint instead of just telling her she couldn't go.", "NAH\n\nYou have every right to know who you\u2019re daughter is spending time with. He\u2019s only 13, I assume, so it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal to meet him. Then again, she may have lied and he could be 16-17, which would be a whole other set of issues.\n\nYou were clear about your expectations and she chose to go around them. Welcome to having a teen. Next time be upfront about the consequences so there is no confusion.", "NTA. for all you know this guy is 20 years old. No parent in their right mind would let their 13 year old daughter go out on a date with somebody especially after lying about it. I\u2019ve always told my kids (oldest now is 12 and all girls) that they start with the benefit of my trust and I\u2019ll give them a TON of space and room to do what they want and make their own way as long as they\u2019re open about it.

And thanks for being a caring dad.", "NTA, but you could have gone outside to meet him", "NTA but they way you went about it wasnt cool.\n\nShe shouldn't have lied but it's her first date and she's probably scared and nervous and thought this would make her less cool to him.\n\nYou could've went outside to meet him or taken her to the pizza place and met him there. Thats what my parents would've done and not relied on the brains of fresh teens to make smart decisions.\n\nAlso the people who keep talking about his daughter like she had malicious intent?!? Shes 13, heck no shes not gonna make good decisions especially when its comes to things she perceives as embarrassing. But shes not trying to dodge the boy meeting her dad so they can go sell drugs together shes just nervous as heck", "It could be either parent but you don't just let your child disappear with someone you dont know. I think it was a couple of years ago two older boys sent a kid younger to go to a girls house to lure her to the the park. Where two older boys met her and took her to an empty house raped and murdered her. So yeah you meet them", "NTA\n\nshe's 13, she shouldn't be leaving the house with ANYONE that you haven't met, no matter what gender they are. you gave her multiple options and opportunities to introduce this guy to you, and she turned down every one.", "NTA. You were being a good dad by wanting to meet the guy. She is a teen so she is going to keep pushing to see where the line is and what you will do.

She lied to you and then tried to sneak out and the attitude that you're \"not allowed\" to tell her no at 13 makes me think she doesn't understand how rules work and the two of you need to have a talk about boundaries before this happens again.\n\nMy daughter is a little younger, but when she's 13 I think I would do the same thing if she got caught lying to me like this.", "NTA for wanting to meet a kid taking your daughter out, but could you not have just walked outside and met the kid yourself?

Or did your daughter specifically not want that either?  \n\nIMO it's kind of a weird, threatening power play to make a boy introduce themselves to you to take your daughter out on a date rather than walking out and meeting him.

Actually you might not realise it but you could have saved your child from something not good even if you are making sure she is safe so NTA.

Tell her that you have every right to make sure she is safe and you want to be sure the guy is a good person.

You're allowed to be concerned about you daughter and to want to know who she's hanging out with. You simply wanted to say hi and see the guy, which isn't unreasonable at all.

I was really young, so I don\u2019t know exactly what was happening to the old one, but I know that it wasn\u2019t going to be lived in anymore. If I had to guess, it got torn down and disposed of. So one day towards the end of the moving out process all the \u201ckids\u201d and their significant others, grandkids, friends, were all there helping to get everything done. \n\nMy uncle was around 22 at the time, and he had a bunch of his buddies there to help. I remember them randomly leaving without telling anyone where they were going, and coming back a little while later\u2014all of them sporting brand new, giant super soakers. The old trailer was pretty much cleaned out at that point, and they started the biggest water gun fight that to this day I\u2019ve ever participated in, inside the house. As a little kid I thought that was literally the coolest thing I had ever witnessed and it was SO much fun! Don\u2019t ask me why, cause the answer is probably \u201cbecause I was 5\u201d, but at one point I remember making my weapon of choice sugar cubes? I just remember all these 22 year old men with super soakers, and 5-year old me throwing sugar cubes at them lol. \n\nI had completely forgotten about that until this thread. I\u2019m gonna have to ask other people who were adults at the time if they have any memory of that because it really seems like the kind of thing I\u2019ve made up in my head but I am 99% sure that at least part of that is accurate lol", "But she's not 30, she's 13, a literal dumb child, who can coerced into almost anything by a stranger who she refuses to introduce, probably because she knows the dad will say no", "When my older sister was 14, she glared at my dad and told him to stop making the noise he was making. The noise he was making was breathing.\n\nAt 15, she threw herself up the stairs cause our parents wouldn't let her hang out on the Vegas strip unsupervised overnight.\n\nI've never been as (outwardly) dramatic as that, which I don't mind in the slightest.", "Do you mean the social media where people intentionally mislead people with how perfect their lives are? There is no way I would I would trust social media or random text messages to get an impression of a person I didn't know. Even speaking on the phone without seeing them in person doesn't allow you to get a full picture of what they're like.", "I agree he could have handled the whole situation better. He also could have simply looked outside and seen that he was who she said he was. But after the daughter lied to him, it's understandable why he made her cancel the date.", "She actually did tell him she was uncomfortable, but he still held this weird condition over her head. If it were about \u201csafety\u201d and avoiding predators, there are 100 other ways he could have checked this kid out.

Of course she could lie about that, but reddit jumping immediately on the grooming train is weird as well. I mean, if the guy was standing outside anyway, he could've just snatched a view on him from the window.", "She asked why and that is it. No \u2018but I feel uncomfortable\u2019 or \u2018can we do something else?\u2019 Or even pleading\u2026 so she tried nothing and directly lied.

That's like one of the unspoken rules, since everything is anonymous. The only thing people have to go off of is limited facts and personal experience.

We all are.", "True.", "NTA and also a little bit YTA\n\nCompletely agree that you should be meeting this guy, clearly your daughter doesn't though so perhaps it would be useful to talk her through what is motivating your actions so she sees you more as back up rather than intrusive.\n\nWhat I *really* don't get though is why OP didn't just open the door and go and meet the guy? He was waiting outside right? Your daughter may have been embarrassed but at least you could have shown her that you tried your hardest to create a circumstance that would make you confortable with her going on this date.\n\nI'm not trying to be too alarmist and I don't think it's quite this deep but please think really carefully about how to engage with your daughter around dating. There's so much to trip up on and you really don't want to end up reinforcing society's bullshit messaging about how women should be afraid and that the men in their lives will control them. Equip her with agency and allow her to trust her gut, with you being someone she feels comfortable coming to check her instincts were correct and for further advice.", "I know other people don't agree but I think you're making way too big a deal out of meeting this guy.  They are 13.  At that age kids are embarrassed by their parents.  Also, it makes them feel as if you are treating them like toddlers.  I think you overreacted over a couple of kids going for pizza.  It's not as if she's going to marry the guy.", "YTA\nI mean\u2026..  He was outside?  Outside your house?  Why didn\u2019t you just step outside and meet him??\n\nThis could have gone two ways.  The way it went so now she won\u2019t tell you next time a guy asks her for pizza or you could have stopped and said:\n\nDaughter, I get this is embarrassing.   But I love you and want to meet the people involved in your life.  This will be quick then go outside and meet him.  \n\nThen when she gets home discuss it.  Discuss how she should handle her feelings!!    That you let it slide this time because she was probably overwhelmed with embarrassment, excitement and trying to be independent.  But being independent doesn\u2019t mean not keeping the people who love you unaware of whats going on with who in their life.  \n\nIt\u2019s a push and pull with kids.   You pulled when she was looking for a push.  Instead of making it work you alienated her and made it less likely for her to communicate honestly with you.", "YTA for not letting her go in the end.\n\nThe boy didn\u2019t do anything wrong here so if your concern was only about your daughters safety then you could have still let her go.\n\nSeems like you\u2019re just mad at her for not telling the boy to come meet you and instead of talking it out with her when she confessed, you just cancelled her date because you were annoyed at her and that\u2019s pretty shitty. It wasn\u2019t about her safety anymore was it.. it was just about you being annoyed with her. \n\nEspecially because she is young so it was probably one of her first dates, great memory to give her.", "YTA. Honestly, that\u2019s embarrassing for a young girl. At 13 there is no need to do that. Maybe if your daughter is 16 and there is a bigger chance of doing things.", "Exactly. Sis is **way off base*& if she thinks it's appropriate to let a 13 year old just leave the house, to go on a date, with someone who she refuses to let meet her dad. That would be foolish and dangerous. OP has no idea if this is even a little boy. This could be a much older teen or even an adult. Anything could happen to his kid and he wouldn't even know who she was with.\n\n13 is very young to be dating, so if I were OP, I wouldn't have only met this kid, I would have confirmed this was OK with his parents, and dropped them off + picked them up. Letting a 13 year old kid just come and go as she pleases, with anyone, is a recipe for disaster and danger.", "I hope OP sees this. My friend started seeing a 25 year old man when we were 14/15 years old. She thought it was cool that he was interested in her. We didn't think much of it at the time. I am horrified to think back to it and am happy nothing happened between them more than a simple kiss. This man was a predator and had a baby with a 18 year old less than a year later. \n\nPlease always meet every person that your daughter is going out with and impress upon her that it is not cool when an older man is interested in her. (not that this date was definitely an old man but it does happen)", "A lot of redditors are teenagers and it is especially noticeable in the comments on such kinds of posts", "I would assume that, best case scenario, those people are teenagers themselves and very indignant about their maturity and autonomy. Darker assumption is that they are adults with ... other reasons to want a 13yo child away from her dad.", "Nah the only thing that matters is the age. If it's the same age or a year difference, you shouldn't gatekeep people from their freedoms.", "I think at that age, calling the parents to make sure they are also OK with their kid going on a date and dropping both kids off/picking them up should probably be standard, too. \n\nThis kid is 13, and like most kids her age, she sounds very young and naive. This could very well be an adult she is meeting, and doesn't know the danger she is getting herself into. And, let's be real.... Even if this was another 13 year old kid, two unsupervised barely teens with no boindaries can get into a lot of adult activities that can have lifelong consequences.", "She's 13! He's already giving her more freedom than a lot of dads would give their daughters at that age. And he only had one requirement, which was an incredibly reasonable one. Her lie says one of two things - she's too unfair to date if she wouldn't even give the guy a choice to meet this requirement,or she knows he's someone that would not agree to that requirement, meaning he's not a good person to date in the first place. OP as a former 13yo girl I can tell you she'll hate you for a little while (while still living you with all her heart) but she'll get over it. Try sitting down and talking to her about your reasons for having this rule once things are calmer. Maybe even get her to listen to a few true crime podcasts! And then tell her about the time I had lived out of home for more than 10 years, had a child, married, divorced, a 5 year relationship after that and my mum still was furious I hadn't told her I was going to stay the night at a new guy's place without telling her because \"he could be an axe murderer!\" (I was in my late 30s!). Parents only put these rules in place because they love you and want to keep you safe, especially at 13. OP, you're a good dad NTA", "Agreed 100%. When I was 13 I was being groomed by some older guys (18/19) and absolutely would not have brought them to the door.

The daughter communicating to her date a boundary or expectation without fear is a sign of maturity. Her being honest about the why and what is a sign of being trustworthy.\n\nShe has failed to demonstrate that.", "It wasn\u2019t all about meeting him. That was part of it, but the bigger issue is that she lied to him and tried to go off on her own with someone who is a stranger to him. She is still a child and completely too immature if she made something like this an issue and lied to him about it. If he was going to do the shotgun dad routine then that could have been an issue, but he wasn\u2019t going to. You don\u2019t reward bad behavior anymore than you should punish them doing something you want. He laid out the requirements for a child to go out, she refused to comply and resorted to deception. Not everything can be a negotiation.", "That's what I don't get. I would say YTA because then the \"punishment\" would have been embarassing the daughter infront of her date & saying \"Hi, I'm the dad. I just wanted to meet you\" blah blah blah.

She\u2019s not getting in trouble for him not meeting the boy, but her, as a child, lying to his face and showing herself as too immature if she made something so simple a problem. You can\u2019t just go and do something blatantly wrong and not expect to get into trouble.", "Using your logic, no child should ever be punished for anything they do wrong because they will just go behind your back. The issue is the lying part. She\u2019s still allowed to go out but it\u2019s reasonable for her, a child, to not be allowed to disappear with what is essentially a stranger.

She also really liked and encouraged me to stay with the first guy I dated in college who ended up being clingy to the point that it took getting student services involved to break up because he threatened to kill himself any time I tried to break up. Then my current bf who is an amazing sweet guy that would never hurt anyone (we've been together for 4 and a half years at this point, living together for almost 3 of those), she keeps trying to convince me is secretly gay and is going to leave me for a guy, and first time she met him straight up told me not to get too attached because of that (my entire family adores him as a human though).", "I mean if the daughter ran away and disappeared, then punish that when she gets back.

I will tell you that kids these days are not the same as we were when we were kids. The things you have to worry about with them are actually quite a bit different. This social anxiety about going up to the door and ringing the doorbell is a real thing and a bunch of kids struggle with it. A lot less kids go out and drink compared to when we were kids. Less of them do drugs. Less of them have sex. Less of them are athletic, and the ones that are tend to be single sport athletes, where there is a crazy amount of competition. Kids these days are more likely to sit at home and do nothing. They are more likely to have social anxiety. They are more likely to be addicted to their cell phones. They are more likely to have depression and problems with cyber bullying. And one of the biggest ones is I think that they are more likely to live in a highly controlled and regulated environment where they are supervised almost 100% of the time. They are used to parents tracking them on their cell phones, they are used to being on camera and monitored on the hallways in school, and they are used to parents that solve every little problem they have for them and tell them exactly what they are supposed to do and when they are supposed to do it. All of this together is a huge problem, we are making a generation of kids that are going to have emotional problems and difficulty dealing with normal situations in life and are not used to having to make decisions for themselves. Being the type of father your father was was probably a good idea because of the kind of kid you were, but chances are your kid is not you and you need to find a different way to parent your kid. \n\n\n\n\nLet me tell you a story that happened two years ago. One of my children decided to become a vegetarian.  I knew it was silly and wouldn\u2019t last because that\u2019s not who she is. She loves meat too much and I knew there was no way she would stick with it. So I made a joke about it. \n\nThat 5 foot tall pain in the ass proceeded to be a vegetarian for the better part of the year just to spite me.  I knew that\u2019s what she was doing because I heard that if she went out with friends, she would eat hamburger on her pizza, but she wouldn\u2019t dream of doing that in front of me. So she hid her meat eating behind my back. She actually lost like 20 pounds despite growing a couple inches and even now I\u2019m shocked when I look back at the pictures of her from before because she physically looks different. All of this just to prove a point to her father.\n\nThe lesson I\u2019ve learned from this is that when my kids grow up I can create rules and I can send guidelines, but I can\u2019t make them do anything. I do it\u2019s my job to help her keep the car in the lane and out of the ditch, but she\u2019s the one that has to do the driving. But if you\u2019re overly strict and you don\u2019t respect her judgment, she\u2019s going to drive that car without you and you\u2019re going to lose any control you thought you had.  \n\nOne more piece of advice. Don\u2019t tell her what to do, ask her questions. \u201cyou\u2019re going to have this guy come in so we can meet him, right?\u201d it\u2019s a lot less confrontational and you can set expectations with her out taking away their sense of autonomy. \u201c what\u2019s your plan if you\u2019re on the date and this guy turns out to be a loser?\u201d we both know most of the time she won\u2019t have a plan, but you are setting the expectation and making her come up with one and making her think about it in advance, along with reinforcing the idea that some guys just aren\u2019t worth spending time with. \n\nBest of luck to you, sir.", "NTA. What you did is called parenting, and we wish more people developed it as a skill.", "NTA. I understand why you did what you did. Wanting to know whith who your 13 year old is hanging out is super reasonable. HOWEVER, when I was 13-14 and my parents wouldn't let me see someone without an adult being present, which I think is reasonable because it's very young but I the time I thought it sucked, I became super sneaky and a good liar. I would lie about where I was/ who I was  with and it could have been unsafe.\n\nBy the time I was 16-17, I would sneak out of my window at night and go see my boyfriend and tell my parents I was sleeping at a friend's when I was at his place. \n\nI'm 20 now and realize how unsafe it was. \n\nThings you should let her know:\n\n1- that you trust her and love her very much but that trust should go both ways and if she wants more freedom, she should be open about what she is doing.\n2- to let you meet the person she's hanging out with and that you won't judge her taste in whoever she wants to date and won't embarass her (unless it's an older person). \n3- to let you know if she has a boyfriend/girlfriend and if she does, regardless of age, have the \"birds and bees\" talk even if you think she's to young to be having sexual experiences. VERY IMPORTANTLY, tell her all about consent and not do anything if she feels pressured or isn't ready.\nSidenote : if you don't let them have sleepovers, that would be understandable but just know that if they really want to have one, they will find a way to do so.\n\nGood luck and I think you're a great dad!!", "Yeah definitely NTA. I really appreciate that OP is clearly making this about looking out for the best interest of his kid rather than being some creepy and/or misogynistic \"girl dad\"-type. He literally just wanted to know who his kid was going to be around, and he was careful to point out that he wasn't going to be peacocking around as the defensive man-of-the-house. She's a minor, and it's just straight common sense.\n\nAs an aside, even though I'm a 30-year-old man now, I recall when I was about 16 or 17 learning how truly creepy older guys were around teenage girls (and how common it was, unfortunately). I was getting my mandatory high school volunteer hours completed, and that job involved close work with people who were getting community service hours completed for court. I was working with a guy who was probably in his mid-30s, and he asked me if I had a girlfriend, which I didn't at the time. I figured he was just a dude asking a teenage boy about normal teenager stuff. \n\nHowever, the conversation continued and he blurted out some line about how \"some 17 year old girls look better than women his age\". I promptly ended that conversation, but it blew my mind that a guy would just freely talk about that, let alone feel that way. Once I got into college, I noticed a similar pattern amongst seniors and even grad students toward the early-entry freshmen. Maybe the age difference wasn't quite as pronounced, but the same predatory attitude existed.\n\nWhile I can fortunately say I've never had such thoughts myself, now that I'm aware of just how prevalent the thinking is, I think a simple meeting with your minor child's associates is the minimum. You don't need to be prying or invasive at all. Just verifying that they're the same age bracket and not immediately rude is probably fine. It also reinforces for your own kid that you're there for them if they ever get in over their heads.", "This this this is 100% this", "I think this is one of the most reasonable and compassionate responses.

He\u2019s definitely not setting unreasonable expectations\u2014but again, when you\u2019re 13 and just beginning to separate yourself from your family and see yourself as an individual while also still being very young, being reasonable can be tough, and I think parents working with their kids to find a middle ground that they both can be relatively comfortable with is the best choice in the long run.", ">The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show **disrespect for elders** and love chatter in place of exercise.

And between there is a gradient scale based on your kid's maturity level.", "NTA for what you did.\nESH for how it happened. \n\nYou may not have been able to avoid it in the moment, but unfortunately your daughter's deceit forced you into an uncomfortable ultimate: ruin your daughter's date in order to keep her safe, or give your daughter what she wants while potentially risking her safety. It's a lose-lose situation, you did the best you could in the moment. Your next steps will either repair the harm caused or create a wider rift in your relationship with your daughter. \n\nFirst, try to understand her reasoning and motivations. Developmentally, it's totally normal for a teen to feel a sense of dread or impending doom at the idea of their parent meeting their date, especially for younger teens. She is probably projecting her feelings onto her date (also developmentally appropriate for teens to be a bit self-centered) and worrying her date will feel as mortified as her, which may not even be true. She was probably super nervous about the date to begin with, I'm not surprised she broke down after being forced into a high-stress nonpreferred activity immediately before departing for the date (consequences of her own deceit, for sure). In the end, both of your feelings and concerns are valid, and it's important to acknowledge and validate both of them. \n\nTo repair the harm: I would explain your reasoning to her. Legally, as her parent, you are responsible for her, which includes protecting her from potential threats. I think wanting to meet the person who is interested in getting to know her romantically is a perfectly reasonable request. For all you know they could be a 40 year old man, it's your responsibility to find out. In terms of the interpersonal aspect, it's a sign of respect for a prospective romantic partner to formally introduce themselves to the parent/guardian/caregiver of the person they want to date,. especially if that person is legally a minor. This is an important life lesson for her. \n\nHer behavior makes me worry about her own sense of self-esteem and whether or not she is ready to date. Deep down, I wonder if she even feels like she is deserving of having a date walk to her front door to shake her father's hand. More importantly, if she doesn't feel comfortable assertively using her voice to make simple requests of her date, I doubt she will be comfortable enough to consent/not consent to physically intimate/romantic adult activities. Knowing that worldwide, 1 in 3 teens experience dating violence and many more experience coercion, I would take this situation as an important sign and adjust accordingly. Make sure your daughter knows how to communicate her wants/needs in specific situations, like \"I don't want to\", \"I don't like that\", \"I'm not ready\", \"no thank you\", \"no\", etc. before she enters adult situations. It sounds like she wasn't able to communicate her wants/needs to either her father or her date in this situation. How will she be able to communicate her wants/needs in higher-stress situations? \n\nI definitely wasn't able to assert myself by the time I started dating in my early teens, I wish my parents had ensured I was ready before allowing me to date. Hell, I didn't learn until I took a self-defense class in my mid-20's. By that time I had experienced countless incidences of sexual harassment and coercion, and had been raped twice. 1 in 3 people experience intimate partner violence and dating violence. My story is probably the norm, not the exception. I don't mean to shock you, just to offer the reality she will be facing. \n\nYou got this, dad. Parent your daughter lovingly and clearly, explain your reasoning in a way she can understand and ensure that she fully understands before moving forward. \nThen, teach your daughter how to navigate the dangers of the world so she will be ready to step into it confidently.

If you\u2019re letting your kid go anywhere unsupervised, you\u2019re accepting that they can just as easily lie to you about where they\u2019re going and with whom, so being strict about it doesn\u2019t necessarily keep them safer, it just makes them sneakier if they don\u2019t think you will approve. Unless you\u2019re literally supervising them 24/7, which is unreasonable for a teenager, you do have to sometimes trust their judgement.\n\nBut, if my parents had ever asked to meet any of my friends, I would have happily introduced them, because I knew my friends and my parents were reasonable, polite people and it wouldn\u2019t be an issue.

I would personally be more concerned with the lie, as a parent.

It's such an easy fix and everyone is going crazy.", "Well, no.  And she received a consequence, right?  The person I was replying to seemed to be saying that since she'd already lied to him once, communicating with her further was fruitless.  That's why I said that it's not one strike and we're done.  Nowhere did I say a parent should let a kid mess up continuously, without consequences.\n\nHe also very much needs NOT to just expect that, after this experience she will \"know better\" next time. That is setting her up to fail.  Too many kids learn \"I need to be sneakier next time\" (or in her case, \"I need not to confess that I lied\" next time).  \n\nHer choosing to lie to him in this situation is not the same thing as touching a hot stove, where the immediate negative consequence teaches you not to do it again.  People are more complicated than that, and the factors that went into her choice to lie are more complicated than that. (Nor do we truly know what those factors are; OP is the only one who can figure that out.)\n\nNot only does he need her NOT to lie to him -- he also needs her not to fear his reaction, so that she will trust him enough to tell him if she really experiences a problem, or something bad happens to her. \n\nShe's 13, and this entire experience was likely \\*mortifying\\* for her -- from feeling the need to lie about asking the boy to meet her dad, to confessing it to her dad, to being punished in a way that immediately let the boy know that her dad was mad at her about something, likely in connection with the date.  To a 13 year old, all of that can feel like the end of the world; or at least, like something that will make her look uncool, which might get out and impact her reputation, and also something that will either scare off the boy from asking her out again OR make him think she's not \\*worth\\* asking out again.\n\nTeens are terrible at risk-assessment (generally), and their reputation and how they are seen by others is incredibly important (usually too important, really, but that doesn't negate the reality that they can attach way too much importance to it and do stupid things to maintain it).\n\nSo you're not going to get a teen to just stop lying by hoping that she wants to avoid the negative consequence again.  \n\nHe's gotta communicate to her.  This time around, he did try (sounded like it! and good for him), but it didn't work.  So he's got to try something different.  Maybe he needs to convince her that he does understand some of those motivations that drive a teen to do stupid things in the name of anxiety about reputation. Maybe he needs to be more explicit with her about the kinds of dangers he wants to be prepared for.  Maybe he can help her understand that, in this case that just happened, if \\*she\\* treated getting the boy to just come and say hi as no big deal, then it wouldn't really be taken as a big deal.\n\nOr maybe he can get through to her by just outright telling her that what he wants the most is for her to feel she can talk to him, or bring a problem to him, or ask for his help, without fearing his reaction or his judgement.\n\nThis time, it sounds like it was probably a benign situation.  Someday, perhaps, it won't be.  And the difference between her feeling she can call him for help, or being afraid to, may be the difference between her surviving, and not.", "Clearer than that, apparently.\n\nHe told his daughter he wanted to meet this guy.\n\nBut he clearly did not \\*communicate\\* why that was important to him, \\*in a way that she was able to understand\\*.  \n\nPeople, let alone kids, aren't just beings of pure reason, where if you are just \"clear\" enough, there will be no miscommunications, or misinterpretations.\n\nCommunication isn't just \"I tell you this thing, and you understand this thing the way that I understand it\".  Communication is figuring out whether the person you're talking to \\*actually does\\* understand it.  Whether you have made your case to the other person in a way that makes them accept the importance of what you're talking about, in the same way that you see it.  Communication is about realizing that your perspective (or OP's, an adult man and a single father) is not the same perspective being experienced by the other person (a 13 year old girl being raised by a single father).   The other person isn't going to automatically see things from your perspective.  They have their own perspective, and you're failing at communication if you don't take that into account.\n\nSo OP \\*SAID\\* \"I want to meet this guy, and see his face\".  That is not what his daughter HEARD.  Maybe the reason his daughter didn't hear that is because there's a lot of other noise in her head (competing viewpoints, worries, anxieties) that keep her from easily understanding what her father really wants, and further, causing her to load it up with a lot of baggage that comes from the social context she is trying to navigate as a middle-school girl.\n\nSo, back to square one.

They're not quite old enough to go out on supervised yet I don't think, but the fact that I've actually met the kid (and played fortnite with him a couple of times) I'm more likely to trust him with my daughter than not.\n\nYour daughter might not agree with you, but consider this a parenting win. She needs to have enough love and respect for you for you to be able to trust her in situations like this.", "YTA\n\nYou were right all the way up to cancelling the date.  She's 13, she's got no tools/skills to navigate relationships.  It's also natural that she would find her parents embarassing.\n\nPlatitudes like \"She's not mature enough to have a date if she can't do this\" are garbage.  How do you think she becomes mature?  By being embarrassed by her father to the point of tears\n\nOf course, we are all thinking \"Well, she'll just explain what an a-hole you are and little billy will be cool and understand\".  BUT SHE DOEN'T KNOW THAT, BECAUSE SHE'S THIRTEEN.\n\nInstead of being understanding and realizing how fucking hard it is for kids to navigate this shit and then being supportive, you blew it all up and demanded that she be a full logical adult instantly.  you could have said \"Look, I'm disappointed you didn't tell me the truth.  I would like to meet him, but that's up to you.  Go on now, and we will talk more about it after you get back.  Have fun.\"\n\nInstead... Nice work.  You think she's gonna tell you the next time she has a date?  Fat chance.\n\nYour one chance to salvage this is to come back and say that you were wrong.  This is new to you, and that you didn't handle it right.    Give her money to pay for pizza.  You can give her some advice for keeping safe, blah blah blah.  Say you trust her, and while you would really like to meet the people she's interested in, you don't need to until she's ready.\n\nOr keep on like this and give her more daddy issues.\n\n(The joke is that a dad's job is to keep his daughter off the pole?  that's misogynist BS.  Your job is to prevent her from thinking to herself \"How you like me now, DADDD?!!\" while she's having sex)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, and I'm the father of two teenage girls who are strong willed, intelligent, and don't feel the need to hide any of this shit from us.  I know every kid is different, but you are guaranteeing that she won't discuss her life with you.", "Hey op u/Downtown_Ant_1320 this is all the confirmation you need to know you did the right thing. If she can\u2019t be honest/speak up with you, she sure as hell can\u2019t do it with when she\u2019s alone with a boy yet", "Easy solution: walk outside.", "There's no guarantee that walking out to meet this kid would have built any trust at all. Seeing that she lied about asking this kid to come in to meet Dad in the first place, the daughter very well would have seen this as an embarrassing move.\n\nHonestly, this might be something that I would have done. But I would have gone out to meet the kid (to make sure that it was actually a kid) and also announced that the date was now canceled because my daughter lied. Yes there would have been resentment with that. Yes I would have been a jerk with that. But that also would have driven home the fact that my daughter should not have lied to me in the first place. There will be other boys. Who knows there may still be a chance with that boy. But either way I know my daughter is safe. PERIOD!", "My dad asked my mom out for a first date and she went to level 9000 right away and made the 'date' dinner with her parents. Talk about hard mode! \n\nHe proposed to her that night. They were married for 50 years.  A boy or man with good intentions has no problem meeting another man, esp the father of the girl he plans to treat well.", "Two cases where? In your city? In your country?\n\nCrime happens. It\u2019s not new. But the chance of it happening to any specific person is very low and it\u2019s been going down for decades. We hear every time something awful happens 100 miles away and our brains aren\u2019t good at probability so it scares us. The only way to keep your kid completely safe is to prevent them from going anywhere in public without you, which brings its own harms if you\u2019re doing that when the kid is 13.\n\nHow many people complain that kids don\u2019t go outside enough? That they\u2019re on their phones too much? But when they try to go out and do things on their own, everyone\u2019s a murderer.\n\nThis causes its own problems. Not being able to try things out in a lower-stakes environment as a kid means she\u2019ll have less experience as an adult and have a harder time finding red flags.\n\nAlso even dividing the number of murders by the number of people in the population (which gives a tiny, tiny, tiny probability of it being her) would give an exaggerated idea of the risk. Most human traffickers aren\u2019t targeting kids in middle class neighbourhoods. They target kids whose parents work 16hours a day because they know it\u2019s easier.", "Here in America, Texas even iirc, we just had a parent arrested for child endangerment because they let their kid walk a few blocks unsupervised.", "From the perspective of a former teenage girl, I understand why she is reluctant. From the perspective of a parent of a teenage girl, oh hell no is she dating a boy I have never met.", "Yeah I know, but physically he's dead and gone. No court proceedings involving him, won't be in the news as much as if he was alive and appealing his sentence. He won't ever be able to get out of prison and have a good life or even reoffend", "We have a co parenting situation and now have a solid \"trust but verify\" policy in place between the adults to make sure we're not being lied to by the 13yo, especially since there's been some dishonesty there in the past", "You\u2019re right. At least she won\u2019t have to look over her shoulder for the rest of her life. I\u2019ve read too many stories of women who have been stalked by men who were jailed, but on release went to hunt their victims down again. Too many times these women reported scary behavior and the police did nothing until it was too late. And considering this guy was a cop I can imagine him getting an easier ride.", "NTA: as I'm reading this I'm thinking of all my female friends who group text a pic of a dude when they go on a first date with a message like \"This is Tim from Bumble. We're going to Starbucks in town.  He drives a white Honda.\" Just so we have the info in case Tim turns out to be a Very Bad Person.  Having someone knowing the face, name and basic information about a man (or boy) you're going off alone with is sadly just common sense as a female in our era.", "It\u2019s one of the important jobs for parents: being the heavy.", "Was 14 over half a decade ago, can confirm.", "Is it because I'm a European that I believe that even minors have a right to some autonomy and privacy? Like friends? What caf\u00e9 they go to? What bus they took to see a friend? \n\nEven when a parent is still responsible for their minor children they never own their kids.", "When I was a teen and would have friends over, my father would point guns at them the second I opened the front door. Needless to say my friends parents weren't happy. I had friends parents refuse to let them visit over this, and rightfully so. Americans can get crazy with guns.", "It would be great if they could include this in the general health/sex ed/family life courses. My high school's approach was pretty open-minded for the 90s, but we didn't talk about anything but the technicalities of reproduction and the terrifying infections you could get from sex until at least 9th grade, and some kids are already active by then.", "UNDERRATED COMMENT", "Exactly. I know it annoys some people but I 100% understand the urge to check and clarify you're doing the right thing with a large group of people in these sorts of situations especially as a parent. It's so easy to doubt yourself when it's you alone making the decisions and the only people in your life are telling you you're wrong.", "OP send this to your sister and daughter. Always meet the boy she goes out with. Everytime.", "This was actually my first thought too and I\u2019m surprised I had to scroll so far to find it. Yes, she could be hiding a hundred different things about the date, including age, but as a lesbian this was where my mind went first! Dad seems kind and understanding based on this post but you can be nervous about coming out even if you have the best parents in the world (I would know, that was my situation!)"]}
