{"id": 14929, "submission_id": "12nwh9q", "title": "AITA for not taking care of my mother", "selftext": "My mother (74) was in a car crash two weeks ago where thankfulky she only suffered a concussion, and a few cracked ribs. She can get around ok, but the concussion is taking some time to recover from, and she has trouble concentrating and remembering things. \n\nI (33f) flew to her city and stayed with her for two weeks just after it happened, took care of her and filled her freezer with two months worth of meals that I planned around her dietary requirements (she has type 2 diabetes). I also organized and payed for a dog walker and groomer, her prescriptions to be delivered, and have set up a meal delivery service for when she runs out of the food I cooked. \n\nShe and I have a strained relationship, and I was low contact for many years, so this was difficult for me. Going into it would take forever, but being around her brings up a lot of painful memories for me, and even though we've worked through a lot in therapy I still find it hard. Especially taking care of her since there were a lot of times when I needed to be taken care of and she didn't. My two brothers who get along with her well both live in her city and did very little to help. \n\nShe absolutely refuses to follow concussion guidelines, and when I tried to speak to her about the importance of avoiding screens she would resort to turning on the TV and using her phone whenever I left the room or after I went to bed. I did convince her to cut down on activities, but I suspect she went back to them after I left. \n\nThis week she ended up back in hospital after she collapsed. She got a lecture from the doctors about cognitive overload, but was back on her phone as soon as she got home.\n\nAnyway, she and my brothers are trying to guilt trip me into flying down again, saying I'm the best one to take care of her. Their reasoning is that one brother works full time, and the other is vision impaired. But I study full time, and although I could do it long distance it would be very stressful. They've even suggested I put off study for a semester, but I'm on a scholarship and I  don't know if I could get a deferral. Plus, I understand she's in pain and likely scared but honestly her injuries are not that serious. She can get around fine. She also lives in a retirement village and could have a nurse come but says she wants me to do it instead. \n\nI feel like I've already done a lot to look after her, and it's frustrating to try to take care of someone who won't take care of themselves. She's someone who really enjoys being in control, so the whole time I'm down there she would be ordering me around and demanding I wait on her hand and foot, so there's no way I would get any study done. \n\nI've also found out one of my brothers has been eating the meals I made for her, so she's running out of them faster than I expected. It really feels like I'm being taken advantage of.", "created_utc": 1681622256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nwh9q/aita_for_not_taking_care_of_my_mother/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A behavioural optometrist might be able prescribe some glasses that would help with screen time and cognitive exhaustion.  The vision testing a behavioural optometrist does is ***not the same as normal eyesight tests regardless of how extensive and detailed they might be***.  A concussion can seriously affect the connection between what the eyes see (normal eyesight tests) and how the brain interprets the vision it sees (behavioural testing).  A simple adjustment to a lens prescription can help a lot to alleviate the effects.  It could improve her quality of life and general functioning immensely.

I was deeply neglected by my mother growing up; she's got mental issues she has never wanted to take care of. Now she has health issues, too (degenerative ones). I'm her only child. While she is more or less able to take care of herself, objectively she would need somebody living next to her. Now, I do what I can when I can, since I don'tlive in her same city and have 0 intentions of moving back (well, that's mostly because she lives there). I've realized that I cannot go NC with her, cos I still love her and I do want to help her out. But the extent to which I am willing to do it depends on me and me only. This changes according to my obligations and, above all, my mental health. And, as I said, I am an only child. Your brothers are misogynistic assholes. They do not need to take care of her, but shouldn't guilt trip you into doing it. And your mom wants you there because she wants to controll you (which is also human, albeit wrong, and that's her problem). So, keep as far away as you want and need. Maybe, since you've had therapy together in the past, explain to her, calmly, your reasoning. But keep in mind: You have all the rights in the world to advocate for yourself. Generally, people tend to act \"holier than  thou\" telling us it's our moral obligation to take care of our parents. It's not. good luck", "You are welcome!

You put in your time.  Stop letting them guilt you.\n\nCute(brother eating her meals).  NO  NO AND NO.  stay where you are and STOP STOP STOP giving into their \"but family\".  \n\nYour mother wasn't/isn't listening to you--what do you think will improve if you go back?  She needs to take responsibility for herself(or the doctors should put her in nursing home temporarily until she can take care of herself).", "NTA, drop the rope. This isn\u2019t your responsibility or problem. You don\u2019t owe her a damn thing. Drop contact again if it\u2019ll be better for your mental health. You don\u2019t have to keep in touch with your abuser just because faaaamily. Sounds like the brothers want you as their maid too."]}
