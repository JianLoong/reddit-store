My parents split when I was 10 because he cheated with my stepmother. My mom took my brother and I back to her home state and my dad only kept in contact with my brother and refused to acknowledge I existed for reasons he still refuses to explain. He went on to adopt his stepdaughter who is also 25 and have three more daughters with his wife that he absolutely adores but he still refused to even call me on my birthdays. Yes, I'm still extremely bitter. \n\nWhen I was 20, my dad had a change of heart after he had a cardiac arrest and decided that he did want to know me. I went to visit him and we began working on our relationship. During my trip there to visit him, I met one of his friend's sons and we started a long distance relationship. I ended up moving to his state after I graduated college to be with my boyfriend and we got married. After my dad's cardiac arrest, he was fitted with a pace maker and monitor.\n\nI'll spare you the details. My husband and my dad's stepdaughter were having an affair. From before we were even married. I was devastated. I couldn't even get out of bed for day and I got hospitalized at a psych ward. At the time, my dad's stepdaughter still lived with him. My dad showed NO signs of disapproval at what she did. He was obviously very angry with my husband, but he didn't even try to do anything about his stepdaughter. He didn't even tell her off. At the very least, I expected him to kick her out. When I asked him why, his reasoning was that she was his daughter so he wasn't going to tell her off and I needed to get over it. I absolutely lost it and blew up at him about our relationship after my parents split and how he refused to even speak to me on my birthdays, attend my graduation or anything for no reason at all. His pathetic excuse at that point was that I looked and sounded like my mother and it hurt to speak to me *but he's the one that cheated on my mother*. After that, I just stood up and told him that he was dead to me and I never wanted to speak to him again. I left and went home.\n\nWhen I got home I was bombarded with phone calls and texts from family members calling me evil for 'wishing death' on my dad. When I tried to explain that I didn't mean that I wanted him to die but that I would never speak to him again, they berated me for 'stressing' out someone with a pacemaker. They're all demanding I apologize and I feel terrible now. AITA?

Not you.\n\nHis stepdaughter is like his own child to him, so he keeps supporting her. From his perspective that's understanding. But he doesn't acknowledge your anger and pain at all. Get over it? What a petty thing to say.\n\nThe thing is, there is a lot of understandable pain and grief from your side. I'd suggest for you to work through these feelings properly with a therapist (because your father's half-assed explanation isn't really doing much - I mean wtf is that even? Is that supposed to explain the way he acted towards you!?)\n\nYou have a right to have your boundaries. And his medical condition is no reason for him to get a free pass at everything. \n\nI don't know who the family is who tries to pressure you now but where were they when he cut you - a child - from his life after the divorce? When he even refused to talk to you? When he didn't acknowledge you while keeping a relationship to your brother?\n\nIf you want to continue having a relationship, it's supposed to be your decision. If you want to cut him from your life, that's your decision too. No one would blame you for it.\n\nI personally think you should choose yourself and your own health.

Every single person. NTA.", "NTA.  I\u2019m sure he and his wife think, well, we can\u2019t exactly call out our daughter for doing WHAT WE DID BEFORE ALSO.  The fact that she did this TO YOU seems to matter to them\u2026.not.one.bit.   I\u2019m so sorry", "NTA he\u2019s not your dad. Go no contact with him and who ever defends him. You\u2019re better than this.", "Nta, you may not be wishing death on him but I am.", "NTA\n\nYour dad sounds like a total jerk, not worth your time. He clearly doesn't care about you, which is demonstrated by his prior and current behavior towards you. That excuse of his was poor at best, but just goes to show he doesn't know how to take responsibility for his actions. Also shows he disregards your feelings. \n\nConsidering your Dad is a cheater, it makes sense he isn't saying anything to his stepdaughter, because she's simply doing the same thing his current wife did in the past. Apple really doesn't fall far from the tree, in terms of your stepmother and her daughter. Sounds like they really enjoy homewrecking.", "NTA, he brought this on himself, do not apologize", "NTA - dad is toxic AF.", "Nta. Don't talk to your dad again", "NTA good God I am so sorry you've been through all of that, and I hope you're able to find some peace and healing away from that insanity", "NTA, do yourself a favor and cut out / block all family members who are mad at you for feeling how you do, they're not family truly", "NTA and tell them where they can put their apology.

I suggest, unless he offers a sincere apology, that you write him off as lost to you.", "Other relatives have no say, didn't walk in your shoes, and you owe their opinions no consideration. Block them if you need to to gain peace \n\nYou are well within your rights to set a hard and fast boundary and write your dad off. Considering the living arrangements, it seems unlikely that your father wasn't aware of the affair, and did nothing. He has never giving you the status of a beloved daughter. You owe him nothing, pacemaker or not. \n\nNTA.", "Watch the father get another medical emergency then want to clear his conscious. OP please don\u2019t let anyone invalidate your feelings bc you are NTA whatsoever.", "NTA. She's his daughter and he wasn't going to tell her off? *You're his daughter too* and he seems perfectly happy not only telling you off but setting the family on you too.\n\nTurns out your father and his wife raised a daughter that didn't fall far from the tree. And were friends with people who also think about relationships the way they do. *Every single one of these people completely betrayed and failed you* and anyone who takes their side isn't any better. My guess is they probably all knew and never said anything because you remind your father of your mother and he resents you for the reminder of all the bad things he did. You don't need these people in your life. They *should* be dead to you and if they take offence to that it's too bad, because they're dead to you and you don't need to care about them anymore.\n\nI wish you luck and happier opportunities with new people in the future.", "WOW\n\nNo your judgement is not clouded .\n\nHe is not a dad and only cause pain in your life .

His stepdaughter destroyed your married and he treates her like a golden child who can't do anything wrong and you have to get over the fact that your future with the man you thought would be with you for the rest of your life was destroyed because his stepdaughter couldn't control herself and you shall get over it.", "NTA.

How many years and why? Why marry you if he wanted the side piece? How is the divorce process going? Any major assets? I hope not for your sake. I hope you can leave and cut all of them off.
