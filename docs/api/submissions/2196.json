My mom took my brother and I back to her home state and my dad only kept in contact with my brother and refused to acknowledge I existed for reasons he still refuses to explain. He went on to adopt his stepdaughter who is also 25 and have three more daughters with his wife that he absolutely adores but he still refused to even call me on my birthdays. Yes, I'm still extremely bitter. \n\nWhen I was 20, my dad had a change of heart after he had a cardiac arrest and decided that he did want to know me. I went to visit him and we began working on our relationship. During my trip there to visit him, I met one of his friend's sons and we started a long distance relationship. I ended up moving to his state after I graduated college to be with my boyfriend and we got married. After my dad's cardiac arrest, he was fitted with a pace maker and monitor.\n\nI'll spare you the details. My husband and my dad's stepdaughter were having an affair. From before we were even married. I was devastated. I couldn't even get out of bed for day and I got hospitalized at a psych ward. At the time, my dad's stepdaughter still lived with him. My dad showed NO signs of disapproval at what she did. He was obviously very angry with my husband, but he didn't even try to do anything about his stepdaughter. He didn't even tell her off. At the very least, I expected him to kick her out. When I asked him why, his reasoning was that she was his daughter so he wasn't going to tell her off and I needed to get over it. I absolutely lost it and blew up at him about our relationship after my parents split and how he refused to even speak to me on my birthdays, attend my graduation or anything for no reason at all. His pathetic excuse at that point was that I looked and sounded like my mother and it hurt to speak to me *but he's the one that cheated on my mother*. After that, I just stood up and told him that he was dead to me and I never wanted to speak to him again. I left and went home.\n\nWhen I got home I was bombarded with phone calls and texts from family members calling me evil for 'wishing death' on my dad. When I tried to explain that I didn't mean that I wanted him to die but that I would never speak to him again, they berated me for 'stressing' out someone with a pacemaker.

Your word choice was poor, but I wager that your Dad who seems unable to shoulder any type of personal responsibility for his past and present actions, twisted your words further to make you the villain.\n\nAt this point, I think you need to only think about your responses to the following questions to understand what, if anything, you should do.\n\n1. Do you want a relationship with your father now?\n2. Would you want a relationship with your father if it turns out he knew of the affair while it was happening?\n3. Would you feel guilty if your father passed away before reconciling?\n\nIf you answer \"Yes\" to the first 2 or 3, then do not end communication, but do set boundaries for how you and your dad can repair your relationship and communicate that to him in a clear way that cannot be misinterpreted or overshadowed by tone and delivery.  Consider a letter or email and let a person who is not too overly invested proof-read to make sure that your words and tone cannot be misinterpreted.\n\nIf you answer \"No\" to all questions, then do what you need to do for your own well-being.  If that is moving back to your home state, cutting off all ties, changing contact info, etc., then do it.\n\nIf you answer \"Yes\" to number 3 only because you feel that the trust is irrevocably broken to continue the relationship, explain in a letter or email (again with the suggestions of the previous paragraph) how you feel about your dad's response to the affair, but leave out that you don't want a relationship.  He does not need to know that, and I guess he would only use that against you with all these meddling relatives.  Do, however apologize BUT only for your poor choice of words that were misinterpreted . . .  nothing else.  That will give him the apology that his so fragile ego needs, placate the meddling relatives, but allow you to begin disconnecting in a way that will not introduce guilt later should he pass away.  Please make sure that when you write this letter, you explain the hurt you felt that he supported your ste-sister in destroying your marriage by not condemning her actions, solely because she was his daughter.  You could add that *\"condemning someone's actions is wholly different than condemning them as a person.\"* And, one more thing, if you are a skilled writer or have a skilled editor, if you want to provide some fertilizer to instigate some personal reflection on his part you might add that you wished you had received the same treatment as your stepsister . . . that he could have remembered you were his daughter even though you looked like your mother.  You will have to say this in a way in which it does not come across too harsh, though which will take some skilled writing.  \n\n***Then,*** put geographical space between you and your dad so that the relationship just naturally starts to become distant, but not because you told him that would happen.", "Your father and his second family are not good people.
