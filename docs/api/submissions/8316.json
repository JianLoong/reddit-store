{"id": 8316, "submission_id": "10lqx20", "title": "AITA for wanting to postpone my wedding till my fiance gets rid of his braces ?", "selftext": "My fiance (25M) has braces. He refused to get them when he was a child/teen cause he feared people would make fun of him, but he finally accepted to get them after the dentists told him clearly that it wouldn't be recommended to replace his extracted teeth till he fixes his crooked ones. The issue is that our wedding was supposed to be coming up soon, but now I plan to postpone till my fiance gets rid f his braces. I have nothing against him wearing braces. I even encouraged him to get them to finally fix his bad teeth, but did you ever saw of a groom wearing braces at his wedding photos ? I don't think so.\n\nI thought my fiance would be understanding, but instead he got mad at me and accused me of being ashamed with him. That's obviously no true, I just want our wedding photos to be as esthetically pleasing as possible and that's why I want to postpone our wedding till his braces come off. I also told him he could've avoided all this if he got invisible braces, but he said these were much more expensive and wanted to save money specifically for our wedding and honey moon and didn't think his fiancee would be so shallow to care about it. He ended up saying that if I postpone the wedding now I might as well just call it off altogether, which I think is incredibly unfair of him to do, but maybe I should've insisted on this issue either.\n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1674736922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lqx20/aita_for_wanting_to_postpone_my_wedding_till_my/", "score": 564, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was not expecting him to get them off so soon, so I asked him if he wanted to delay the wedding by a week so he wouldn\u2019t have them in the photos. It doesn\u2019t matter to me either way, but I thought he might be more comfortable without them.

She wanted him to get invisible braces. So it doesn't sound like she was doing it for him; she was asking for herself.

You could look at it that the braces are temporary so the photo would not be a true reflection of what he really looks like, and as much as they shouldn't be a problem they will definitely draw the eye of anyone looking at the picture.", "Also a photographer and if someone asked me this they would be paying double no doubt. I\u2019ll remove an officiant out of one photo and it takes me just as if not even longer than my actual edits.

The problem in this situation is that there will be pictures taken that last a lifetime so she just wants them to be as good as they can. She doesn\u2019t care if he has braces 364 days a year, but for wedding photos it\u2019s normal to want everything to be as pretty as possible on that day.

If it\u2019s that important she can pick her favorite portrait of the two of them she wants to hang somewhere and with her fianc\u00e9s permission have the braces photoshopped off. Otherwise who cares. My fianc\u00e9 broke his leg in half an month before our wedding and instead of postponing like a maniac we just picked out some cool looking canes and he used those. A lot of my pictures were less traditional but it was my wedding day, all you should really care about is capturing all of your friends and family together. And I\u2019m saying this as someone who spent $8000 on photography. Good photos were clearly important to me.
