{"id": 8316, "submission_id": "10lqx20", "title": "AITA for wanting to postpone my wedding till my fiance gets rid of his braces ?", "selftext": "My fiance (25M) has braces. He refused to get them when he was a child/teen cause he feared people would make fun of him, but he finally accepted to get them after the dentists told him clearly that it wouldn't be recommended to replace his extracted teeth till he fixes his crooked ones. The issue is that our wedding was supposed to be coming up soon, but now I plan to postpone till my fiance gets rid f his braces. I have nothing against him wearing braces. I even encouraged him to get them to finally fix his bad teeth, but did you ever saw of a groom wearing braces at his wedding photos ? I don't think so.\n\nI thought my fiance would be understanding, but instead he got mad at me and accused me of being ashamed with him. That's obviously no true, I just want our wedding photos to be as esthetically pleasing as possible and that's why I want to postpone our wedding till his braces come off. I also told him he could've avoided all this if he got invisible braces, but he said these were much more expensive and wanted to save money specifically for our wedding and honey moon and didn't think his fiancee would be so shallow to care about it. He ended up saying that if I postpone the wedding now I might as well just call it off altogether, which I think is incredibly unfair of him to do, but maybe I should've insisted on this issue either.\n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1674736922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lqx20/aita_for_wanting_to_postpone_my_wedding_till_my/", "score": 6146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If HIS feelings about braces were why she suggested it, rather than her own feelings about the aesthetics, it would be a reasonable consideration.

I was in Invisalign for nearly two years and only then could they begin the dental implants, all of which took years. The only reason I was able to get this all done to begin with was because a very generous friend was covering the cost for me. If the groom doesn't have a lot of money, and wedding costs he'll need to cover, its likely he'll have to delay tons of work. Insurance doesn't always cover it and even if it does, its not much. \n\nIt's also hard to get into dentists' offices because they're packed with people getting care they were forced to put off during the pandemic and needing more intensive procedures. The implants might also have issues. I've had to have mine repositioned, I've had the crowns come off, and I had my most recent implant removed because it turned out there wasn't enough bone there. The bone graft and growth process can be six months to a year before the implant can be put back in.

If it's one photo do it for free assuming you're not just getting paid 800 bucks to start with.  Any more charge per image.
