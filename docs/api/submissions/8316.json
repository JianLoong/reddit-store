{"id": 8316, "submission_id": "10lqx20", "title": "AITA for wanting to postpone my wedding till my fiance gets rid of his braces ?", "selftext": "My fiance (25M) has braces. He refused to get them when he was a child/teen cause he feared people would make fun of him, but he finally accepted to get them after the dentists told him clearly that it wouldn't be recommended to replace his extracted teeth till he fixes his crooked ones. The issue is that our wedding was supposed to be coming up soon, but now I plan to postpone till my fiance gets rid f his braces. I have nothing against him wearing braces. I even encouraged him to get them to finally fix his bad teeth, but did you ever saw of a groom wearing braces at his wedding photos ? I don't think so.\n\nI thought my fiance would be understanding, but instead he got mad at me and accused me of being ashamed with him. That's obviously no true, I just want our wedding photos to be as esthetically pleasing as possible and that's why I want to postpone our wedding till his braces come off. I also told him he could've avoided all this if he got invisible braces, but he said these were much more expensive and wanted to save money specifically for our wedding and honey moon and didn't think his fiancee would be so shallow to care about it. He ended up saying that if I postpone the wedding now I might as well just call it off altogether, which I think is incredibly unfair of him to do, but maybe I should've insisted on this issue either.\n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1674736922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lqx20/aita_for_wanting_to_postpone_my_wedding_till_my/", "score": 2408, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I didn\u2019t care the rest of the time but for some events it\u2019s okay to care about how the pictures will turn out.", "Agreed, my braces totally changed the shape of my mouth/face too. I look super weird in all pictures from that time. \n\nIf it were me I would want to wait, but I think it depends on how long they would have to wait, have they booked anything yet, is there any benefit to getting married earlier rather than later, etc. Like there isn't much difference between being engaged vs being married, so what's the big deal with waiting a couple months or a year?\n\nIf it were interrupting some other life plans, like they wanted to start having kids soon but not while unmarried, then yeah it's not worth it to wait. Like many things in life, it depends.", "Agreed. People pay thousands for these photos and they\u2019re of what\u2019s one of the most important days of your life. It\u2019s not like these are permanent fixtures in his mouth, a deformity, or something else that would otherwise be permanent, nor is it easily hidden. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s being a bridezilla for wanting to look back at pictures of her wedding and not see her fianc\u00e9\u2019s braces. The monetary investment alone is enough to want everything to be just right.", "Agreed. It's a relatively minor request but I'm not sure it's enough to postpone a wedding after they've already planned it all out.

Make believe world.", "That is very time consuming and costly, and there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll even like the result. If I were a photographer I\u2019d charge a lot more to do that. \n\nAs a dentist, I would recommend asking the orthodontist to simply remove the wires and brackets temporarily and polish the teeth. Do your wedding, then have them placed back on. They would charge for the service, but it would be a lot cheaper than having a photographer edit each picture.", "Photographer here.. Not true\u2026", "Yup. Imagine a dude wanting to postpone the wedding because she needs to lose weight or something.

How would she feel then?", "\u201cTrue colors\u201d\u2014I have a real question-I genuinely want to know, do weddings really *really* drive people bonkers where they loose all sense of rationality and start to act entitled, rude and pretty much like major jerks under the premise that it is \u201ctheir day\u201d (in preparation for and just for that day)? Or is this some behavior that has been/is \u201clatent\u201d and unlocks itself under the pressure of the situation/big life-changing event? *In other words, can nice people be infected with \u201cbridezilla-ism\u201d as well?*", "Exactly.

People here are being incredibly dramatic and comparing braces to facial disfigurement. Which in my humble opinion, are not similar in the slightest.", "My parents went to one of those tiny Vegas churches that are seen as a joke. They've been married 40 years", "I was going to say this. It's easy to smile without showing teeth.", "Or, he could have photos showing him happy, in love and depicting just how he looked/felt on his wedding day....", "Not everyone is able to do that.

Pictures can still be perfect without worrying about such a meaningless thing", "She did encourage him to \u201cfix his bad teeth\u201d\n\nCrooked teeth are not bad teeth anymore than having a crooked nose means having a bad nose.

You can\u2019t make a life with someone who is not ready to accept imperfections as part of it.", "People put a lot of emphasis on Wedding Photos. They're expensive and I understand that. But they're supposed to be about the emotion of the day. To convey the happiness you were feeling and to remind you who you were at the time. If that involves braces, a burn, a pregnancy, grey hairs, whatever... Then that should be there. It's part of the story. Part of the emotions of the time. People seem to forget why we memorialize things. It shouldn't be \"Look how pretty I was.\" That route just runs people into the ground as they age and change.", "Photos that no one cares about. Literally no one. In the history of ever, cares about your wedding photos. People don\u2019t want to look at them. They don\u2019t care.", "They can remove entire people out of photos. You think they can't fix some braces pictures if it's that big of a deal?", "No, I am sorry this is not a reach. OP\u2019s attitude about this is concerning because she is still insisting on it after knowing that he was insecure for so many years. It also goes against the \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d concept, ya know? \n\nThis is also controlling behavior. Pictures represent the time they were taken, and what is more beautiful than to go about it naturally? What is aesthetically so unpleasing about braces? She can photoshop them out, or she can just, accept the fact that he is at that stage of his life while getting married and love him for all he is. Little things like this really show someone\u2019s love and also their emotional maturity. Its doing small, seemingly inconsequential shit like this that grows to toxic behavior.", "I'd rather have a strong marriage that can last a lifetime instead of chipping away at my fiance's insecurities for the sake of some pictures that I may look at once every couple of years....", "She cares more about looks than she does the person. I\u2019m so sick of brides thinking people, ESPECIALLY the groom, are props for a photo.

My cousin got married shortly after coming home from Afghanistan and had some new scars that her makeup couldn\u2019t fully cover. Heck I was also at a wedding where the groom and all the groomsmen had shaved their heads in solidarity with one of them who was battling cancer. If anything, all of these imperfections are what make the photos unique and a true capture of important moments in history.

We've seen how op feels in that situation", "You're as shallow as this bride is.", "I agree it depends on how long the braces are gonna be on if it\u2019s less then a year then it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal to postpone over a year it\u2019s a problem already\u2026.", "She'd be hurt, confused, angry.

Some people (aka me) look like they're painfully grimacing when smiling without showing teeth.", "Literally, even in a more complex use of procreate or adobe it would take 10-30 min to edit one persons braces out of a wedding shoot. Hell you could give them the straightest teeth on earth if you wanted to.", "As a photographer that has shot a lot of weddings your just wrong.  Editing braces out of ONE photo is a chore, doing it from many photos can be days of work depending on the amount. I would charge a significant extra fee anytime someone asked me to edit something out that shows up in every photo.", "Dude. That was my thought. Pushing a wedding back must cost $$$$. \n\nPlus, if fiance's teeth are really bad, braces could take several years.

Then his fiancee does ***this***.", "Yeah, I'm currently planning a wedding and we managed to find a photographer that would do just a few hours  for like $150/hr. \n\nThis was opposed to the other photographers that ONLY offered wedding packages for like $2000. \n\nBoth me and my fiancee did not give a shit if we had pictures of the reception or anything like that.  We need like 1 or 2 good pictures from the ceremony and a few of the immediately family and wedding party afterwards and that's it.   PHones are good enough now that there will be enough pictures of everything that happens after.", "Yeah, I feel like this should have just been a conversation where she asked him how HE felt about the pictures with braces and if he would prefer to wait or not and go with his decision.   \n\n\nIf the marriage lasted in 20 -30 years when looking at the photo's no one is going to be embarrassed or upset.  If anything it will be one of those memories that they could laugh about together.   \n\n\nBut now, he has a memory that his fianc\u00e9 was ashamed of him.", "As are most of the wedding centric posts on AITA.....\n\nThere are many people who are willing to nuke lifelong friendships, cut off family, and damage their relationships for the sake of a pretty wedding.", "I was heavier than I wanted to be, had not maintained my hair due to depression and stress, and a good portion of our reception invites got lost in the mail. We still had a blast, and while I don't love every photo I have plenty to choose from that I do like to look back on.", "It is absolutely that easy. Like I get it, but it\u2019s not serious. Your love is serious. She would be rip shit if she, say, had a hair coloring mishap and burned her hair and had to get it cut short and he wanted to put off the wedding.", "Tbh, she'd be the asshole is she went that way too.", "This was my immediate thought. I don't even think it would be particularly tough? I'm sure she can just ask the photographer before they hire them to make sure they are capable lol", "This is my thought exactly. Plus - last time I checked - it's totally possible for the groom to smile WITHOUT showing teeth.", "But why should they be? Marriage is about sharing your lives, about loving and accepting your partner as they are, not about hiding stuff you dislike in each other for a perfect show. Many people don't seem to understand that the wedding is NOT about the pictures nor about your guests dresses. If she cares more about the pictures she shouldn't get married at all as she's missing the whole point of marriage.", "Or just smile with mouth slightly open.  No teeth.

But even if it didn\u2019t, the primary \u201cbig deal\u201d is that there\u2019s no actual *reason* to postpone, except that the bride is shallow.", "That's fair. I would only suggest that for a few photos, not the entire thing. At the end of the day, it's not a big deal to have braces in pictures. It's a day of remembrance ONLY and it would include \"hey that's when you got your teeth fixed too, that was a crazy year\" and move on with your lives.", "Right but I don't know anyone who has ALL their wedding photos up in frames/canvas photos, etc and those are the ones which will be viewed by most people.\n\nYou let them pick out a certain number and just say you'll only be editing those photos. It's not really 'very difficult'.", "I'm a wedding photographer and absolutely do hand edit all of the photos to perfection.   Why would you charge someone thousands of dollars and then return photos that could have been done with a good cell phone and an aunt that knows how to pose people?", "But would it cost more than postponing an entire wedding, which would entail lost deposits and having to put down new deposits or paying updated fees?", "but you probably would for one or two that the couple wanted to print and frame", "Uhhuh, good point. YTA OP.", "This should be a higher rated comment because this is why the post is here in the first place.

Most wedding photographers charge 2-3k for over a  week plus of full time work plus all the equipment and insurance and all the consults on top of that, there's no time to edit braces out of 200 photos on that pay.  For 8k then of course but your already paying for a premium service and that photographer will likely have an assistant to edit for them.", "Exactly! I was so lucky to never experience the stress a lot of brides do when planning a wedding, ESPECIALLY a big one (for context we had a nearly 300 person wedding that ended up costing like $67k when all was said and done) because I went into knowing something would go wrong no matter how much I planned. I just did my best and then the day of I had the best day of my life even though somethings did go wrong because I just looked at is as funny stories to tell people when they\u2019re planning a wedding or funny stories to tell our future children and family about. It was so fun and my husbands cane was a hit with the groomsmen I think at one point if the night they staged a photo shoot in the drawing room with cigars where they each posed with a cane leaning up against the poker table with books all around.

I have no idea where the pictures went. With my current husband, we got married with the justice of the peace. Two witnesses, no pictures, no big deal, had our lunch later at the Olive Garden of all places. We were just happy to be married. We chose to use the money we saved together for a house, not a party.", "I'm trying so hard to have this attitude about my upcoming wedding (18 weeks away), but it's a struggle as I have control issues and mild OCD stuff.
