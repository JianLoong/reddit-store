Not that it really matters because:\n\n**YTA - part two (the major one) - gun safety:** holy shit you need to leave this person until they understand that you do NOT point a gun at someone, EVER.

They make great bedside quick release safes just for that!!!!). That said I see another comment say this might not be a Christmas thing but should be separate and I agree that's probably the better course.

A very key part of gun safety is that the bullets and guns should be stored separately (ideally in separate safes). I knew where a lot of my parents' guns were as a child, but I ***never*** knew where the bullets were.", "NTA and you should stand your ground.\n\nif you do this, he's going to resent it a little bit at the very least. what you could do is offer to get BOTH of you a gun safety course. give him the opportunity to feel like big responsible protector, show interest in what he's doing, ask him to come with you and take it seriously because you don't want to go alone.\n\none, he'll feel you're more approving of his hobbies and feelings without feeling like he's being attacked or being called stupid(which he is, but it can be counterproductive to call him that to his face)\n\nhe's being an idiot, so far, but maybe you could give him a chance to be NOT an idiot. he'll probably respect the trainers a lot more as authorities on firearms, and you'll both learn more about guns and gun safety practices. so it's a chance for him to learn something and change his behavior.\n\nbut, clearly, he did wave a gun around you with a round in the chamber. i would only give him this ONE chance. if you ask him to go to gun safety class with you, and he turns down this opportunity, you need to reconsider the relationship due to concerns for your own safety.", "\"He freaked out back to me about how I didn't know what I was talking about.\"\n\nLong time gun owner and user.

That would be a passive aggressive move.  You're buying him something he doesn't want but you think he needs. Either present it as a gift for both of you or remove Christmas from the equation and just buy it because it's something you'd like to do with him.\n\nBTW, the situation you describe (minimal training, multiple unsecured weapons lying around, overconfidence in inability) is the classic setup for death by accidental shooting. Refusal to take safety training and to secure the weapons in a safe would be a relationship deal-breaker for me.", "NTA and this is why those classes exist.\n\nYou can say much like with anything practice makes perfect and that everyone needs refreshers.  I have co workers that I trust with my life and go retake gun safety classes periodically to keep their skills right.  When it's literally life & death, there is no such thing as \"too safe\".  If they refuse an \"poo-poo\" the gift then you can make them decide is having a weapon necessary.", "NTA.\n\nHe could have accidentally shot himself as much as he could have accidentally shot you.

He could get pissed and not do it.\n\nWhy not try to approach that as a partner event? You both go there together to the safety training and shooting afterwards. You can always frame that as: You have no experience and want to learn about safety and he can just tag along.", "Not imposing judgement either way, but maybe try buying a class for you both as a date sort of thing?

I just want to remind you OP that women are more likely to be killed by someone they know than a stranger, and that having guns in the home actually make people more likely to be shot.

A gun safety course, even a refresher course, is never a bad thing. Ans also, as a responsible gun owner, he would/should be respectful of those around him and their nervousness towards guns. As to hap-hazardlay pointing it, many years ago, when I was showing my then fiance' my Ruger 22, after I removed the trigger lock, popped the magazine and checked the chamber before handing to her, when I did, she did the typical stupid childish action of pointing it at me and saying BANG. I grabbed it from her hand and proceeded to tear her a new asshole, even though I knew the gun was empty.  She was damn near in tears. But I was mad as hell, because as I had explained before I showed her the gun, it is not a toy, it is a deadly weapon and she be treated with respect. With a gun, you never take chances. Period.", "NTA\n\nBut I fear for your safety\n\nYou freaked out at having a loaded gun pointed at you and his response was to freak out harder! \n\nHe minimised your fears and concerns... All whilst holding a loaded weapon in his hands.\n\nHowever, from his reaction to that incident I can't see  him being happy and appreciative when he receives a voucher for gun training.\n\nOnly you know your husband. Do you think he'll respond well to receiving it?\n\nYou're NTA for wanting him to learn gun safety and responsible ownership practices. However, he doesn't seem receptive so far. Will you be opening a world of pain for yourself?", "NTA, at all!  In fact, I think it's an excellent idea!  You did not grow up around guns (I did not, either) and you are absolutely correct that his skills in proper handling of weapons are lax.  Those are the mishaps that so often end in tragedy.  Let him know that the guns make you feel uneasy, but you also understand why he worries about protection.  You thought this would be a perfect compromise so that you can BOTH feel as comfortable and safe as possible.  You might even benefit from signing up for safety lessons, as well.  I have friends who take the safety lessons and instructions, together, as a couple.  That way, you can both become well schooled in safety and use of these weapons.  Good luck!", "NTA.   \n\n\nI would consider myself a heavy 2A person. However, that being said there is rules to owning a gun. Top one is like you said never point a gun at someone or anything unless you intend to kill it.   \n\n\nFurthermore, I would implore you to get him a training class. You can find them at the local gun ranges or even a more advanced class to make it seem more exciting to him. ( i can go into detail about this if you'd like but trying not to bore you.) \n\nAlso, i would suggest in getting a small gun safe. They are a way to protect you guns incase of a break in and allows no guests to accident stumble upon it in a drawer.   \n\n\nSpeculating here - Its really dumb to keep a loaded gun in a drawer without a holster that how people have accidental discharges.", "NTA! And if he has a problem maybe that's a big ol red flag", "NTA.  If it were me, I'd sign him up not for a safety course but a concealed pistol course or what your state calls their conceal pistol permit.  Usually ranges will offer these courses and it'll be several hours of verbal instruction and two hours of handling competency on the range.  They will take him through all the safety requirements and encourage him to regularly practice and gain that competence. In my experience they have the same fear of intruders so your partner might take it better from experts that have a similar starting point.  \n\nIf he doesn't listen, that bullet will eventually fire and who knows where you'll be relative to the barrel.  His house would not be a safe space.", "YWBTA if you told him that it was a Christmas gift, just for him. \n\nThat said, if you can\u2019t be upfront and honest with him about your fears and concerns, ask that he take a gun safety course at your expense, and have respond calmly, then it\u2019s time to get out. Make sure you have an exit plan if this conversation doesn\u2019t go well.", "NAH.\n\nBoundaries are important, especially gun boundaries. But this is a passive aggressive approach to a very real concern. Just say \"hey I'm not comfortable with your gun safety, lets go learn together I'll pay.\" No need to gift them.", "NTA - You\u2019re completely in the right to freak out. You, only under malicious circumstances, NEVER point a gun at somebody EVER. He absolutely needs to know gun safety if he\u2019s going to mess around with it like that.", " I think YWBTA if you make a point of it. Buying him a safety course as a holiday gift, especially if that's the only holiday gift he's getting from you, would be seen as passive aggressive. \n\nIs there a package that would let you spend time at a shooting range together that has a safety course for both of you as a part of the experience? That might be a better option.", "NTA\n\nHis guns make you uncomfortable. He may find that your suggestion that he 'needs training' makes him uncomfortable, but you're already mitigating that by joining him on the lessons and pairing it with range time.\n\nThis is a fantastic compromise.

I don\u2019t believe in having a loaded gun in a house if you have never practiced shooting that very gun. \n\nI stole a gun at my parents house. My mom said she hated me and would call the police. I just said okay and still have the gun. It belonged to my stepfathers father. He said I could have it. He passed away and mom is in a nursing home where she cannot even feed herself hence the reason I took their gun. I have never had a chance to shoot it. It\u2019s very old fashioned and not really what I would want. So it\u2019s unloaded for now. \n\nMy father once showed a gun to my husband and I. He pointed at us while he showed it.

All I've ever learned about guns is the very basics of safety and the fact that even if the magazine is out ,a round in the chamber could still fire or misfire during a cleaning and kill people", "100% agree, possessing a firearm with lack of training could be dangerous or even deadly.", "Thank you. When I hear the *click click click* and I know he's in our bedroom fucking around with the slide and mag clip (I don't know why he does this maybe to see that it's still working correctly), I corral myself and our dogs downstairs to hang out because I just don't feel comfortable. I'm truly mostly anxious about a misfire that could end up harming myself or one of our dogs.", "Agree, I've decided it will be a couple thing and not just him. I need to get over my anxiety about guns and learn how to properly use one.", "I like this distinction. Safety course for 2 = a gift as a way to spend time together. Safety course just for them = A VERY GOOD IDEA that would seem passive aggressive. NTA.", "He's only ever owned one at a time and the one he currently has does have a case. I prefer it be in a lock box but that's something he'll have to afford because I can't. The gun and the ammo are separate as far as I know. But I believe it is loaded, safety on, and stored in the case in our bedroom. No idea if that's a good safety practice but another great reason why we both should be going to a safety course together. Definitely won't be doing it for Christmas or just for him, those will be bad moves.", "Tell me you're jealous of the USA without telling me you're jealous of the USA.", "I'm going to wait until after the holiday because his birthday falls close to Christmas as well. Sometime in the new year I'll suggest that we do a safety course together.", "I have a list of things Im going to get him (prior to thinking of this gun safety thing). I'd be a total dick just got him one thing that is more for me than for him lol", "I think that's what I'm going to do. I really don't want to upset him and I think part of my anxiety about this comes from the fact that I don't like guns. Mainly because I've never used one and holding one feels a bit like holding a hand grenade. I get horribly intrusive thoughts about it misfiring. I think the best course of action would be for us to go together and take safety lessons", "THIS RIGHT HERE. I think this is a hill worth dying on because you may actually die due to his incompetent gun handling.", "I agree!! Plus if OP will continue to live in a home with guns, they need to learn how to safely handle them.", "Ugh reading that last part made my stomach turn. That's literally what my intrusive thoughts are made of. I can't stand people who treat guns like toys. \nI have horrible intrusive thoughts about them, I imagine him handing me his gun unloaded and absolutely safe and my intrusive thought says that a bullet magically and suddenly discharge and hit my dog.\nI think some of that intrusive stuff comes from my anxiety being around guns and my inexperience with them. I would never ever take a gun from someone and then point it at them I can't even imagine that", "Thank you! I'll look into courses that are specific to that", "ALL OF THE UPVOTES", "I'm going to look into packages for the both of us. I just had this thought recently about buying him range time and then I figured that at a range they would have safety courses too. I do think it's something we both should do together. I'm agreeing with the commenters here who are saying it should be a couple's activity. I think that would be a great idea.\nIt certainly isn't the only gift I would get him and I might scrap it as a gift idea and just buy us a package sometime next year.", "Confirmed. This isn't a gift, it's a necessity.", "Thank you, You're 100% right. I'll definitely be looking at this as a couple course after the holidays. His birthday falls right around Christmas so I have to wait until after the holiday so it doesn't look like a gift because it's not a gift and he might take it as a gift. But definitely going to be doing a course together because I need to be comfortable with guns as well if there has to be one in our home per his safety requirements.", "Comment stolen from: /u/blueavole \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z75baa/wibta_for_buying_my_partner_30m_gun_safety/iy4sfvf/\n\nBot Reported.", "Well your boyfriend is wrong. Just because the magazine is out doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t fire. He doesn\u2019t even have a basic understanding of his own weapon. God I\u2019m so worried for you OP.", "> I think (and I could be wrong) that his explanation for why I was wrong was that it wouldn't fire if the magazine wasn't in to engage the shooting mechanisms.\n\nWhen I took hunter safety, it was drilled into our heads that safeties, like the one your describing, are mechanical devices that can and do fail.  They do not fail often, but relying solely on a mechanism that can fail to prevent death or serious injury is a no go.", "There are models that have a magazine disconnect. I'd guess the majority of handguns don't use them, but he could have one that does. I believe California recently made it mandatory that new handguns sold there have them though.\n\nNevertheless, most gun owners would agree that it's a terrible idea to rely solely on that feature. You should always make sure the weapon is unloaded before handling it the way he was. But, even when unloaded and cleared, he shouldn't be flagging other people with it.", "You need to be much more concerned about this than you are. Honey, he pointed a LOADED GUN AT YOU and then freaked out on you for being upset about this\u2026 if your friend told you she huddled downstairs with her dogs when she heard her boyfriend playing with the guns because she was afraid of him, his irresponsibility, and the fact that he is generally unsafe, would your suggestion be \u201cyeah girl, just get him some lessons next year some time!\u201d \n\nGuns are dangerous and your boyfriend treats them like toys. No one who is actually serious about firearms is that lackadaisical about them. You should be much more concerned. \n\nI don\u2019t like firearms, but we have them in my home and I have my concealed carry permit because I refuse to be around dangerous items that I don\u2019t fully understand. God, I can get over that he pointed a damn loaded firearm at you. \n\nNTA.", "You might consider getting him sort of gun safe for Christmas.  And the lessons for both is good. If he's resistant to either,  I'd personally have a hard time with it. Guns are not toys.", "No, your anxiety is completely valid.\n\nThe biggest danger to your life right now is your irresponsible and paranoid partner, by an incredible margin.", "Exactly what I was going to recommend.", "That's smart.", "Did that include,  shooting ( to wound) anyone who pulls a gun on you in your own home?", "Thanks for the clarification. I've never owned a gun and have never taken a safety course but my gut tells me that's not a good safety practice.", "Oh hun I have never been and have no desire to visit. But apart from that and ur incorrect assumption ' u OK?", "LMAO. Dude come on. I'm from the USA and no-one is jealous of our gun laws (or lack thereof). Actually, to be honest many people aren't jealous of the US due to much of anything anymore given the state of our country.", "Tell me you can\u2019t come up with your own phrase and live on TikTok without telling me.", "Why do you think that there is any jealousy here? Most of us in the western world have laws and cultures where people only have a gun if they need it for hunting or sometimes sport like clay pigeon shooting. The idea that one keeps or carries one for self defence is pretty alien to us.\n\nWhy do you think we're jealous of such a culture. I'd hate to live in so much fear that I felt the need to have an easy way of killing someone on hand.", "Sounds like a good plan. I don\u2019t care for guns personally. I prefer archery as there\u2019s a significantly lower chance of accidental discharge. Of course that\u2019s never a 0, as anything that\u2019s designed to launch a thing into another thing Carries some risk, but my hindbrain says bows are safer, so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "OP, he's pointing guns at you and you're worried about upsetting him??? Girl, you need to be getting mad. He's being flippant and ignorant about endangering your life and you're more worried about his feelings. Just take a moment and think about how messed up that is and where each of your priorities lie. And do not have children with this man", "I understand your anxiety and I have issues with a number of gun owners and their attitudes, but I don't want to set off a whole argument here. I have been a gun owner for a long time, have long been into target shooting, but am by no means a gun worshiper. The only thing I can suggest for you is to take a gun safety course yourself, get acclimated to guns, try to be a bit more comfortable around them. I'm not saying you have to like them, but maybe you need to be the one to make up for his lax attitude towards gun safety. And honestly, as a longtime target shooter, going to the range one every couple of months can be a cathartic experience, great at relieving stress. But that's your decision.", "Okay thanks for informing me of that. It actually makes a lot of sense to think of it that way and I will make sure to bring that point up if ever it becomes a point of conversation between us", "Your reply reminds me of the advice people give others about, \"Would you speak the way to a friend as you do to yourself?\" \nYou're absolutely right that if a friend of mine said the same things to me that I'm saying to the internet I'd be upset. \nIt's clear that he and I both need a safety course so that I could feel comfortable", "Budget is a little tight this year and I was planning on getting him some other things that he likes... at less cost. I will suggest that he does eventually buy a secure safe for it because after all it is his gun and he should be storing it properly.", "I'd like to learn how to properly handle a weapon without a lump of fear and anxiety stuck in my throat. On the very minimal chance that someone were to break into our home, very minimal, and I were the only one home I prefer to have a line of defense because I have a feeling my dogs would be hurt by some crazy fucker who also would have a gun. America \ud83e\udd74", "It\u2019s not best practice by a long shot, but many people argue that keeping a gun unloaded with ammo separate makes it useless for quick home defense. Best practice is to have the UNLOADED gun and ammunition in separate locked containers.", "Seriously. I've been to the US many, many times (have actually traveled there more than I've traveled within my own country), and the longer I live, and the laxer the gun laws there get (and I say this as a person who is not anti-gun per se, who has many friends in the military including the US military, and who has handled firearms myself), the less I want to go back. Their gun culture is ridiculous, and the absolute idolatry and stupidity around firearms there is some of the dumbest shit I've ever seen in my life.\n\nIt's the only country in the world where, as a culture, people genuinely refuse to see guns as plain old dangerous tools like chainsaws, and instead insist on treating them like some sort of weird beloved toys.", "In the moment I was very much angry and yelling and made my point very clear. I just don't like rocking the boat so I tend to bottle things up instead of communicating like an adult. Good communication has always been a very poor skill of mine. Edit: no interest in kids, personally so no worry there.", "You might mention that guns are popular to steal so its another good reason."]}
