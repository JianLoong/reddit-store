Not that it really matters because:\n\n**YTA - part two (the major one) - gun safety:** holy shit you need to leave this person until they understand that you do NOT point a gun at someone, EVER.

They make great bedside quick release safes just for that!!!!).

Either present it as a gift for both of you or remove Christmas from the equation and just buy it because it's something you'd like to do with him.\n\nBTW, the situation you describe (minimal training, multiple unsecured weapons lying around, overconfidence in inability) is the classic setup for death by accidental shooting. Refusal to take safety training and to secure the weapons in a safe would be a relationship deal-breaker for me.", "NTA and this is why those classes exist.\n\nYou can say much like with anything practice makes perfect and that everyone needs refreshers.  I have co workers that I trust with my life and go retake gun safety classes periodically to keep their skills right.  When it's literally life & death, there is no such thing as \"too safe\".

He could get pissed and not do it.\n\nWhy not try to approach that as a partner event? You both go there together to the safety training and shooting afterwards. You can always frame that as: You have no experience and want to learn about safety and he can just tag along.", "Not imposing judgement either way, but maybe try buying a class for you both as a date sort of thing?

A gun safety course, even a refresher course, is never a bad thing. Ans also, as a responsible gun owner, he would/should be respectful of those around him and their nervousness towards guns. As to hap-hazardlay pointing it, many years ago, when I was showing my then fiance' my Ruger 22, after I removed the trigger lock, popped the magazine and checked the chamber before handing to her, when I did, she did the typical stupid childish action of pointing it at me and saying BANG. I grabbed it from her hand and proceeded to tear her a new asshole, even though I knew the gun was empty.  She was damn near in tears. But I was mad as hell, because as I had explained before I showed her the gun, it is not a toy, it is a deadly weapon and she be treated with respect. With a gun, you never take chances. Period.", "NTA\n\nBut I fear for your safety\n\nYou freaked out at having a loaded gun pointed at you and his response was to freak out harder! \n\nHe minimised your fears and concerns... All whilst holding a loaded weapon in his hands.\n\nHowever, from his reaction to that incident I can't see  him being happy and appreciative when he receives a voucher for gun training.\n\nOnly you know your husband. Do you think he'll respond well to receiving it?\n\nYou're NTA for wanting him to learn gun safety and responsible ownership practices. However, he doesn't seem receptive so far. Will you be opening a world of pain for yourself?", "NTA, at all!  In fact, I think it's an excellent idea!  You did not grow up around guns (I did not, either) and you are absolutely correct that his skills in proper handling of weapons are lax.  Those are the mishaps that so often end in tragedy.  Let him know that the guns make you feel uneasy, but you also understand why he worries about protection.  You thought this would be a perfect compromise so that you can BOTH feel as comfortable and safe as possible.  You might even benefit from signing up for safety lessons, as well.  I have friends who take the safety lessons and instructions, together, as a couple.  That way, you can both become well schooled in safety and use of these weapons.  Good luck!", "NTA.   \n\n\nI would consider myself a heavy 2A person. However, that being said there is rules to owning a gun. Top one is like you said never point a gun at someone or anything unless you intend to kill it.   \n\n\nFurthermore, I would implore you to get him a training class. You can find them at the local gun ranges or even a more advanced class to make it seem more exciting to him. ( i can go into detail about this if you'd like but trying not to bore you.) \n\nAlso, i would suggest in getting a small gun safe. They are a way to protect you guns incase of a break in and allows no guests to accident stumble upon it in a drawer.   \n\n\nSpeculating here - Its really dumb to keep a loaded gun in a drawer without a holster that how people have accidental discharges.", "NTA! And if he has a problem maybe that's a big ol red flag", "NTA.  If it were me, I'd sign him up not for a safety course but a concealed pistol course or what your state calls their conceal pistol permit.  Usually ranges will offer these courses and it'll be several hours of verbal instruction and two hours of handling competency on the range.  They will take him through all the safety requirements and encourage him to regularly practice and gain that competence. In my experience they have the same fear of intruders so your partner might take it better from experts that have a similar starting point.  \n\nIf he doesn't listen, that bullet will eventually fire and who knows where you'll be relative to the barrel.

You, only under malicious circumstances, NEVER point a gun at somebody EVER.

Buying him a safety course as a holiday gift, especially if that's the only holiday gift he's getting from you, would be seen as passive aggressive. \n\nIs there a package that would let you spend time at a shooting range together that has a safety course for both of you as a part of the experience? That might be a better option.", "NTA\n\nHis guns make you uncomfortable. He may find that your suggestion that he 'needs training' makes him uncomfortable, but you're already mitigating that by joining him on the lessons and pairing it with range time.\n\nThis is a fantastic compromise.

I just said okay and still have the gun. It belonged to my stepfathers father. He said I could have it. He passed away and mom is in a nursing home where she cannot even feed herself hence the reason I took their gun. I have never had a chance to shoot it. It\u2019s very old fashioned and not really what I would want. So it\u2019s unloaded for now. \n\nMy father once showed a gun to my husband and I. He pointed at us while he showed it.

However, this should not stop you. Gun safety is nothing to be frivolous around or about. My suggestion, get the course for both of you, so that you both take the same course together. You can stretch the truth and say that you want him there with you bc it makes you feel better because you didn't grow up around guns, don't have much experience with them and at least there's one person in the course with you that you know.

To me, it's just one of those things that I can easily see causing a fight but that can be avoided with the right wording (we both are taking the course/I want you there bc it'll make me feel better) and planning (both taking instead of just him). \n\nIn all honesty, that kind of mindlessness would be enough for me to break up with someone. I haven't grown up with guns either. I never held one until I was with my husband and the only one I have ever fired was his dad's 38 special (the one we had was just to big and heavy for me to confidently handle). My hubby has taught me safety though, and thankfully he is a stickler for it. You are right that the # 1 rule is never point a gun (loaded or unloaded) at something you don't intend to shoot, and if you intend to shoot be prepared to kill. So the fact that he pointed a gun at you bc he wasn't paying attention is pretty much worse then if he was purposely doing so. If it was me there would be 3 options. Take the safety course, get rid of the guns or leave. \n\nSo get him the courses his feelings on it don't matter, everyone can benefit from a refresher no matter how skilled and comfortable they are around guns. Just attempt to avoid the argument by signing both of you up (many places even have couples classes that cheaper then for 2 individual people, I have also seen specials where the couples class is cheaper than the price for an individual).

There are ways to be not as in danger from the guns in your home, but your husband is not doing those things. And worse, he is blas\u00e9 about safety.\n\nYou need to deal with this ASAP", "NTA. If this individual doesn\u2019t know how to properly handle a firearm, he should not have said firearm. I think it\u2019s a wonderful gift that you gave him, but it needs the ultimatum that if you don\u2019t go to the class, you will return the gun, or I will leave.", "YWBTA in his mind unless you handle this just right. What about a gun safety/shooting experience weekend for the two of you to do together, where you also learn how to handle a weapon? Maybe something like a dude ranch or hunting cabin or nature resort to make it more fun?", "I won\u2019t judge this, this is a massive safety issue. Gun safety shouldn\u2019t be a gift, it should be a basic requirement.\n\nHe is not a safe partner - he is reckless and the odds of him discharging the weapon or even shooting someone out of negiligence is high.\n\nAnd if you ever plan to have children, he will not be a safe parent.\n\nIf he isn\u2019t willing to take proper precautions and handle a weapon safely, you need to leave. Don\u2019t try and soften this by presenting it as a gift.\n\n(You taking those courses is a good idea regardless.)", "NTA\n\n>all while hap hazardly pointing it in my direction multiple times while I stood in the room.  \n>  \n>And...the kicker was there was a bullet the chamber while this happened.\n\nNOPE. That is a situation where you throw down the ultimatum. He gets gun training with his own money and NEVER points a gun at you again even if he thinks it's not loaded.\n\nOtherwise you're out the door regardless if the rest of the relationship is perfect or not.\n\nYou could have died. You rightly freaked out and he proceeded to freak out AT you, saying that you didn't know what you were talking about? Did he at least have the decency to apologise when you found out there was actually a bullet in the chamber?", "OP, my ex-bf was a SF Marine, multiple deployments, expert in many firearms. He grew up around firearms (his dad was a cop) and went multiple times to the range. We were visiting his dad for the holidays, his dad left a revolver which he had just gotten out. My bf determined it wasn\u2019t loaded, did not do a visual check, pointed in my direction and said \u201cdon\u2019t worry it\u2019s not loaded.\u201d I freaked out, moved, my bf pulled the trigger and guess what?! There was a round in there.  He did a shocked Pikachu face, and brushed it off. \n\nOP, your safety is the most important thing, make this guy an ex. He obviously doesn\u2019t care or value your life. YTA to yourself if you stay.  Please be careful", "You want it to go over well then get it as a \"couples\" gift and go with him. He is likely going to resent you giving him this as a gift as it calls his competency into question ( but judging by what you had said about there still being a round in the chamber that doesn't look good anyway) but if you frame it as you want to learn too and thought it would be nice to go together then he is way more likely to me open to it.", "First off, you don't know the cardinal rule.  It's not \"don't point unless you intend to shoot\", it's \"don't point unless you are PREPARED\" to shoot, and yes, there's a difference.  Just like how there was a cartridge or a \"round\" in the chamber and not a bullet.  The bullet is what comes out of the carteidge.\n\nNow, getting him the lessons for the holidays would be a jerk move.\n\nWhat I suggest you do is AFTER the holidays get him and YOU lessons and range time (as you pointed out).\n\nFirst, it never hurts to show interest in something your partner enjoys, even if you don't.    \n\nSecond, if you are going to have guns in the house, even if you don't shoot and will never touch one, you should know safety just as much as he does.\n\nThird, if you take lessons and shoot a bit with him, you'll have the moral stance to point out when he's doing something unsafe.   You would also have the position to buy something like a trigger lock or a safe or whatever.\n\nYou getting him safety classes is like him getting you cooking or decorating classes.", "This is beyond just being an asshole, this is about your partner being a gigantic irresponsible gun owner and fatal accident waiting to happen.\n\nThat said YWBTA given his reaction to pointing a loaded gun at you, giving his the \"gift\" isn't going to end well and you really need to reevaluate your relationship and if you want to be a statistic.", "NTA But you will be if you stay with someone who points a loaded gun at you. He will not appreciate the \"gift\" and the safety training should not be a gift, it should be a requirement for you staying in the relationship.", "YWBTA - If you didn't buy him the training course.", "NTA but you should buy yourself a new place to live instead. He's showing he doesn't care about your safety.\n\nWhere I live, a woman shot her husband to death by accident on Thanksgiving. Imagine him having to live with that. \n\nI'm not a fan of guns but respect people's right to own them. Unless you're irresponsible like he is.", "NTA. Your partner is incompetent with a gun.", "My husband was a Marine.  He took a gun safety course years after he left the Marine Corps and got a concealed carry permit when he got paranoid about break ins.  He said he learned SO MUCH from these courses.  He was very good at target shooting at the firing range, but he learned a lot about how to store guns safely.  I hope you get this gift for your husband and he takes the classes seriously.", "10000% I've only gone shooting with my partner a few times and I've been told \"you never point a gun at someone unless you intend to kill them\" at least 10 times before we go each time.  I even make sure I go over the guns with them each time to make sure Im handling it safely.", "Also where is the gun safe in this house???? Stuffed in a drawer are you fucking kidding me?? Mr. Paranoid is going to have a nasty lesson to learn if someone *does* break in and, while rifling through the drawers, finds a nice little murder weapon all laid out for him.", ">holy shit you need to leave this person until they understand that you do NOT point a gun at someone, EVER. It's always loaded. It's not a toy. Holy shit you should have left the moment he did it the first time.\n\nWhile I say NTA for wanting to gift it to him, YTA for not realizing that the gift issue is *NOT THE PROBLEM HERE!*", "Right....  Because ultimatums have such a wonderful history of working so well.", "Not necessarily - I had a friend who had to kick out a flatmate a few years back because he was storing a few guns in unsecured cardboard boxes in their flat's unlocked garage, and we live in NZ!", "Because shooting is enjoyable?   That's why so many do it.", "The only downside with that is that the careless guy now has a CCW", "I grew up with a lot of firearms in the home and NONE were ever \u201cstuffed in a drawer or in a case.\u201d  They were kept unloaded in a secure location.  \n\nThe rule of never pointing a gun at someone unless you intend to use it is non-negotiable.  So much so that one day when my father came home to find me playing with a squirt gun he immediately took it away from me and crushed it underfoot.  He didn\u2019t want us even pointing a play gun at another.", "I can\u2019t stand the trend of voting an OP who is not the asshole TA on the technicality of \u201cYTA fOr NoT dOiNg YoUrSeLf A fAvOr AnD-\u201c just stop. It\u2019s ridiculous and annoying.", "Slightly confused, would you mind clarifying. Does the case that he keeps the gun in lock? Or do you mean that he keeps an unsecured loaded gun in the home?", "When you get intrusive thoughts, especially if you\u2019re in the presence of a firearm that might give you anxiety, practice methods to ground yourself and be hyper aware of the present. \n\nOne of the things I do, and I need to keep trying to do that quickly, is assess my body. If I\u2019m super anxious but my kid might be in danger (something falling on him etc) I never want to let my anxiety have me second-guess acting immediately", "Honestly if you're going to continue to live in a household with firearms you'll need to learn how to manage that anxiety.", "Don't take him to a concealed carry class unless you want him to carry concealed.", "Most leftists that I know are pro-gun and are gun owners. It's a well established \"joke\" that if you go far enough left, you get your guns back. ;-)", "We are all probably more centrist but have been forced into these \"labels\"; guns mean right, abortion means left, blah blah blah.

That was the original reason for them....   If someone grabbed their gun, and they were losing, all the LEO had to do was drop the clip and the gun wouldn't fire the one in the pipe.  They are actually quite common these days", "Thank you. I am terrified of guns and every single time gun enthusiasts are always like \u201cif you just learned\u2026\u201d\n\nNo. Stop that. I am at the bottom of the list of people you want to have a gun, somewhere above OP\u2019s husband.", "Man when I was learning firearms safety in intermediate we had a solid month or two studying theory and had to pass a safety test before we were even allowed to touch a gun", "Lol, I know right? There are so many mass shootings that we can't even keep track of them....I'm laughing at the insanity of it all, but its such a tragedy that our country is this way...SMH", "It doesn't have to be, which makes it even worse. The US has so much money. We could have free healthcare, 12 months paid parental leave, cheaper higher ed, less guns/violence, free childcare, etc, we just choose to keep our citizens in poverty and struggling for racist reasons.", "That works too!", "It's there a way to frame it like OP wants to learn and asks him to go with her? It might be an easier pill to swallow if he's going for her, but the end result will be they both take the course.", "I get the idea but don\u2019t see it working. It sounds like he\u2019s just straight up careless and sees no issue with it. It would probably end up being a waste of money when he refuses to go. \n\nThis is a really concerning issue and you are better off being direct and telling him that you are afraid for both your safety and his. He needs to understand that a gun is a deadly weapon and shouldn\u2019t be handled in such a laidback way. He could have killed himself or you waving around a loaded gun like that.", "I am a gun owner (trained user) and rule 1 (through infinity) is the gun is always ALWAYS loaded.
