Not that it really matters because:\n\n**YTA - part two (the major one) - gun safety:** holy shit you need to leave this person until they understand that you do NOT point a gun at someone, EVER.

They make great bedside quick release safes just for that!!!!).

Either present it as a gift for both of you or remove Christmas from the equation and just buy it because it's something you'd like to do with him.\n\nBTW, the situation you describe (minimal training, multiple unsecured weapons lying around, overconfidence in inability) is the classic setup for death by accidental shooting. Refusal to take safety training and to secure the weapons in a safe would be a relationship deal-breaker for me.", "NTA and this is why those classes exist.\n\nYou can say much like with anything practice makes perfect and that everyone needs refreshers.  I have co workers that I trust with my life and go retake gun safety classes periodically to keep their skills right.  When it's literally life & death, there is no such thing as \"too safe\".

He could get pissed and not do it.\n\nWhy not try to approach that as a partner event? You both go there together to the safety training and shooting afterwards. You can always frame that as: You have no experience and want to learn about safety and he can just tag along.", "Not imposing judgement either way, but maybe try buying a class for you both as a date sort of thing?

A gun safety course, even a refresher course, is never a bad thing. Ans also, as a responsible gun owner, he would/should be respectful of those around him and their nervousness towards guns. As to hap-hazardlay pointing it, many years ago, when I was showing my then fiance' my Ruger 22, after I removed the trigger lock, popped the magazine and checked the chamber before handing to her, when I did, she did the typical stupid childish action of pointing it at me and saying BANG. I grabbed it from her hand and proceeded to tear her a new asshole, even though I knew the gun was empty.  She was damn near in tears. But I was mad as hell, because as I had explained before I showed her the gun, it is not a toy, it is a deadly weapon and she be treated with respect. With a gun, you never take chances. Period.", "NTA\n\nBut I fear for your safety\n\nYou freaked out at having a loaded gun pointed at you and his response was to freak out harder! \n\nHe minimised your fears and concerns... All whilst holding a loaded weapon in his hands.\n\nHowever, from his reaction to that incident I can't see  him being happy and appreciative when he receives a voucher for gun training.\n\nOnly you know your husband. Do you think he'll respond well to receiving it?\n\nYou're NTA for wanting him to learn gun safety and responsible ownership practices. However, he doesn't seem receptive so far. Will you be opening a world of pain for yourself?", "NTA, at all!  In fact, I think it's an excellent idea!  You did not grow up around guns (I did not, either) and you are absolutely correct that his skills in proper handling of weapons are lax.  Those are the mishaps that so often end in tragedy.  Let him know that the guns make you feel uneasy, but you also understand why he worries about protection.  You thought this would be a perfect compromise so that you can BOTH feel as comfortable and safe as possible.  You might even benefit from signing up for safety lessons, as well.  I have friends who take the safety lessons and instructions, together, as a couple.  That way, you can both become well schooled in safety and use of these weapons.  Good luck!", "NTA.   \n\n\nI would consider myself a heavy 2A person. However, that being said there is rules to owning a gun. Top one is like you said never point a gun at someone or anything unless you intend to kill it.   \n\n\nFurthermore, I would implore you to get him a training class. You can find them at the local gun ranges or even a more advanced class to make it seem more exciting to him. ( i can go into detail about this if you'd like but trying not to bore you.) \n\nAlso, i would suggest in getting a small gun safe. They are a way to protect you guns incase of a break in and allows no guests to accident stumble upon it in a drawer.   \n\n\nSpeculating here - Its really dumb to keep a loaded gun in a drawer without a holster that how people have accidental discharges.", "NTA! And if he has a problem maybe that's a big ol red flag", "NTA.  If it were me, I'd sign him up not for a safety course but a concealed pistol course or what your state calls their conceal pistol permit.  Usually ranges will offer these courses and it'll be several hours of verbal instruction and two hours of handling competency on the range.  They will take him through all the safety requirements and encourage him to regularly practice and gain that competence. In my experience they have the same fear of intruders so your partner might take it better from experts that have a similar starting point.  \n\nIf he doesn't listen, that bullet will eventually fire and who knows where you'll be relative to the barrel.

You, only under malicious circumstances, NEVER point a gun at somebody EVER.

Buying him a safety course as a holiday gift, especially if that's the only holiday gift he's getting from you, would be seen as passive aggressive. \n\nIs there a package that would let you spend time at a shooting range together that has a safety course for both of you as a part of the experience? That might be a better option.", "NTA\n\nHis guns make you uncomfortable. He may find that your suggestion that he 'needs training' makes him uncomfortable, but you're already mitigating that by joining him on the lessons and pairing it with range time.\n\nThis is a fantastic compromise.

I just said okay and still have the gun. It belonged to my stepfathers father. He said I could have it. He passed away and mom is in a nursing home where she cannot even feed herself hence the reason I took their gun. I have never had a chance to shoot it. It\u2019s very old fashioned and not really what I would want. So it\u2019s unloaded for now. \n\nMy father once showed a gun to my husband and I. He pointed at us while he showed it.

However, this should not stop you. Gun safety is nothing to be frivolous around or about. My suggestion, get the course for both of you, so that you both take the same course together. You can stretch the truth and say that you want him there with you bc it makes you feel better because you didn't grow up around guns, don't have much experience with them and at least there's one person in the course with you that you know. So it may make him feel like he's doing it for you, so that you feel safer around guns and people you don't know.

To me, it's just one of those things that I can easily see causing a fight but that can be avoided with the right wording (we both are taking the course/I want you there bc it'll make me feel better) and planning (both taking instead of just him). \n\nIn all honesty, that kind of mindlessness would be enough for me to break up with someone. I haven't grown up with guns either. I never held one until I was with my husband and the only one I have ever fired was his dad's 38 special (the one we had was just to big and heavy for me to confidently handle). My hubby has taught me safety though, and thankfully he is a stickler for it. You are right that the # 1 rule is never point a gun (loaded or unloaded) at something you don't intend to shoot, and if you intend to shoot be prepared to kill. So the fact that he pointed a gun at you bc he wasn't paying attention is pretty much worse then if he was purposely doing so. If it was me there would be 3 options. Take the safety course, get rid of the guns or leave. \n\nSo get him the courses his feelings on it don't matter, everyone can benefit from a refresher no matter how skilled and comfortable they are around guns. Just attempt to avoid the argument by signing both of you up (many places even have couples classes that cheaper then for 2 individual people, I have also seen specials where the couples class is cheaper than the price for an individual).

After they took him away because it\u2019s a FELONY to threaten a life in the middle of domestic violence altercation.
