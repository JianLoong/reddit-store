Not that it really matters because:\n\n**YTA - part two (the major one) - gun safety:** holy shit you need to leave this person until they understand that you do NOT point a gun at someone, EVER.

They make great bedside quick release safes just for that!!!!).

Either present it as a gift for both of you or remove Christmas from the equation and just buy it because it's something you'd like to do with him.\n\nBTW, the situation you describe (minimal training, multiple unsecured weapons lying around, overconfidence in inability) is the classic setup for death by accidental shooting. Refusal to take safety training and to secure the weapons in a safe would be a relationship deal-breaker for me.", "NTA and this is why those classes exist.\n\nYou can say much like with anything practice makes perfect and that everyone needs refreshers.  I have co workers that I trust with my life and go retake gun safety classes periodically to keep their skills right.  When it's literally life & death, there is no such thing as \"too safe\".

He could get pissed and not do it.\n\nWhy not try to approach that as a partner event? You both go there together to the safety training and shooting afterwards. You can always frame that as: You have no experience and want to learn about safety and he can just tag along.", "Not imposing judgement either way, but maybe try buying a class for you both as a date sort of thing?

A gun safety course, even a refresher course, is never a bad thing. Ans also, as a responsible gun owner, he would/should be respectful of those around him and their nervousness towards guns. As to hap-hazardlay pointing it, many years ago, when I was showing my then fiance' my Ruger 22, after I removed the trigger lock, popped the magazine and checked the chamber before handing to her, when I did, she did the typical stupid childish action of pointing it at me and saying BANG. I grabbed it from her hand and proceeded to tear her a new asshole, even though I knew the gun was empty.  She was damn near in tears. But I was mad as hell, because as I had explained before I showed her the gun, it is not a toy, it is a deadly weapon and she be treated with respect. With a gun, you never take chances. Period.", "NTA\n\nBut I fear for your safety\n\nYou freaked out at having a loaded gun pointed at you and his response was to freak out harder! \n\nHe minimised your fears and concerns... All whilst holding a loaded weapon in his hands.\n\nHowever, from his reaction to that incident I can't see  him being happy and appreciative when he receives a voucher for gun training.\n\nOnly you know your husband. Do you think he'll respond well to receiving it?\n\nYou're NTA for wanting him to learn gun safety and responsible ownership practices. However, he doesn't seem receptive so far. Will you be opening a world of pain for yourself?", "NTA, at all!  In fact, I think it's an excellent idea!  You did not grow up around guns (I did not, either) and you are absolutely correct that his skills in proper handling of weapons are lax.  Those are the mishaps that so often end in tragedy.  Let him know that the guns make you feel uneasy, but you also understand why he worries about protection.  You thought this would be a perfect compromise so that you can BOTH feel as comfortable and safe as possible.  You might even benefit from signing up for safety lessons, as well.  I have friends who take the safety lessons and instructions, together, as a couple.  That way, you can both become well schooled in safety and use of these weapons.  Good luck!", "NTA.   \n\n\nI would consider myself a heavy 2A person. However, that being said there is rules to owning a gun. Top one is like you said never point a gun at someone or anything unless you intend to kill it.   \n\n\nFurthermore, I would implore you to get him a training class. You can find them at the local gun ranges or even a more advanced class to make it seem more exciting to him. ( i can go into detail about this if you'd like but trying not to bore you.) \n\nAlso, i would suggest in getting a small gun safe. They are a way to protect you guns incase of a break in and allows no guests to accident stumble upon it in a drawer.   \n\n\nSpeculating here - Its really dumb to keep a loaded gun in a drawer without a holster that how people have accidental discharges.", "NTA! And if he has a problem maybe that's a big ol red flag", "NTA.  If it were me, I'd sign him up not for a safety course but a concealed pistol course or what your state calls their conceal pistol permit.  Usually ranges will offer these courses and it'll be several hours of verbal instruction and two hours of handling competency on the range.  They will take him through all the safety requirements and encourage him to regularly practice and gain that competence. In my experience they have the same fear of intruders so your partner might take it better from experts that have a similar starting point.  \n\nIf he doesn't listen, that bullet will eventually fire and who knows where you'll be relative to the barrel.

You, only under malicious circumstances, NEVER point a gun at somebody EVER.

Buying him a safety course as a holiday gift, especially if that's the only holiday gift he's getting from you, would be seen as passive aggressive. \n\nIs there a package that would let you spend time at a shooting range together that has a safety course for both of you as a part of the experience? That might be a better option.", "NTA\n\nHis guns make you uncomfortable. He may find that your suggestion that he 'needs training' makes him uncomfortable, but you're already mitigating that by joining him on the lessons and pairing it with range time.\n\nThis is a fantastic compromise.

I just said okay and still have the gun. It belonged to my stepfathers father. He said I could have it. He passed away and mom is in a nursing home where she cannot even feed herself hence the reason I took their gun. I have never had a chance to shoot it. It\u2019s very old fashioned and not really what I would want. So it\u2019s unloaded for now. \n\nMy father once showed a gun to my husband and I. He pointed at us while he showed it.

However, this should not stop you. Gun safety is nothing to be frivolous around or about. My suggestion, get the course for both of you, so that you both take the same course together. You can stretch the truth and say that you want him there with you bc it makes you feel better because you didn't grow up around guns, don't have much experience with them and at least there's one person in the course with you that you know.

To me, it's just one of those things that I can easily see causing a fight but that can be avoided with the right wording (we both are taking the course/I want you there bc it'll make me feel better) and planning (both taking instead of just him). \n\nIn all honesty, that kind of mindlessness would be enough for me to break up with someone. I haven't grown up with guns either. I never held one until I was with my husband and the only one I have ever fired was his dad's 38 special (the one we had was just to big and heavy for me to confidently handle). My hubby has taught me safety though, and thankfully he is a stickler for it. You are right that the # 1 rule is never point a gun (loaded or unloaded) at something you don't intend to shoot, and if you intend to shoot be prepared to kill. So the fact that he pointed a gun at you bc he wasn't paying attention is pretty much worse then if he was purposely doing so. If it was me there would be 3 options. Take the safety course, get rid of the guns or leave. \n\nSo get him the courses his feelings on it don't matter, everyone can benefit from a refresher no matter how skilled and comfortable they are around guns. Just attempt to avoid the argument by signing both of you up (many places even have couples classes that cheaper then for 2 individual people, I have also seen specials where the couples class is cheaper than the price for an individual).

The bullet is what comes out of the carteidge.\n\nNow, getting him the lessons for the holidays would be a jerk move.\n\nWhat I suggest you do is AFTER the holidays get him and YOU lessons and range time (as you pointed out).\n\nFirst, it never hurts to show interest in something your partner enjoys, even if you don't.    \n\nSecond, if you are going to have guns in the house, even if you don't shoot and will never touch one, you should know safety just as much as he does.\n\nThird, if you take lessons and shoot a bit with him, you'll have the moral stance to point out when he's doing something unsafe.   You would also have the position to buy something like a trigger lock or a safe or whatever.\n\nYou getting him safety classes is like him getting you cooking or decorating classes.", "This is beyond just being an asshole, this is about your partner being a gigantic irresponsible gun owner and fatal accident waiting to happen.\n\nThat said YWBTA given his reaction to pointing a loaded gun at you, giving his the \"gift\" isn't going to end well and you really need to reevaluate your relationship and if you want to be a statistic.", "NTA But you will be if you stay with someone who points a loaded gun at you.

This should not be a request or gift from you though, it should be the last straw or your leaving for your safety.\n\nAbsolutely NOT THE ASSHOLE\nSource: Own 20+ Firearms that have never harmed a soul", "NTA he needs the classes but not as a gift. Plan an adventure and enroll the both of you.", "NTA\n\nI likely have more experience than 99% of people with weapons, so I will give you my take.\n\nIn my state, you have to pass a safety class if you are to use a firearm under a certain age. I took the test before I could read properly because I was so young. An old gentleman read me the test. He also wrote for me because I was still learning how to write. I passed the course, with my older brother just barely beating my score (he's 7 years older than I), but I watched a 35yo man fail because he was so cocky about it he slept. I will never forget the instructor yelling at him saying \"THAT LITTLE KID KNOWS MORE ABOUT GUNS & SAFETY THAN YOU. YOUR PATHETIC\". I only knew more, because I paid attention to everything. The moral of this is, a little kid can learn this stuff yet an adult that doesn't take it seriously can fail miserably. \n\nNow I can read and write lol. I went to college for wildlife biology. My job is to remove invasive mammals. So I spend 60 hours a week basically hunting (I do entomological stuff on the side as well). My guns are on me at all times when I'm working. They get used at least 5 times a day. \n\nHere's what I'll tell you, I am ANAL about gun safety. You are 100% right. YOU NEVER POINT A GUN AT ANYONE. It does not matter if it's unloaded. It does not matter if the clip is removed or the barrel is split. It does not matter if the safety is on. It does not matter if it's partially disassembled. You never point it at anyone. When I was young, if I accidentally flashed my barrel past someone I was backhanded hard by my grandfather. Now, some may see that as bad, but I learned just how serious that was because he would never do that to me for anything else. \n\nThe best technique is to always have the gun, if being held, pointed at the ground. Not a foot or leg, but the ground. This is the second rule for me. A gun pointed in the air is still dangerous. An accidental shot can led to a bullet coming down on someone. \n\nWhen I was 8, I was trying to unload my shotgun when all I heard was \"NOT LIKE THAT!!!\". Then BOOM it went off with my grandfather standing right next to me. I had it aimed parallel to the ground. Had anyone been in front of me they would have been dead. This gun had a very sensitive mechanism that could trigger just from unloading. Guns are not perfect so don't trust them like they are. Point them at the ground. \n\nThe third most important rule to me is you never load a gun until it's ready to be used. At the range, that means no bullets in till you step up to shoot. In life that means unless you're hunting no bullet in the chamber. If you are really proficient with your weapon you can walk with it unloaded and load it fast enough to still make the kill. Everyday I'm out working, I walk with my weapon unloaded. I am fast enough I can stumble on my target, get loaded, and kill it before it can move far. I didn't need years of field work to do that, just practice. If you cannot load a gun fast and smooth and then hit a target simultaneously you're probably not as proficient as you think you are. \n\nFourth, never ever leave guns laying around. My best friend almost shot his best friend with the father's gun when they were 7. They found it and thought it was cool. My friend cocked it and pointed it at his friend. He then pointed it away and pulled the trigger. BOOMMMMM, it went off three feet to the left of his friend's head and blew through the glass door. Locking up guns isn't just for kids. Drunk adults should never ever handle a gun. You shouldn't drink at all when weapons are present. They are easy to grab if not locked up. Further, if someone steals that weapon and kills someone with it you can be charged. If you're really unlucky they can trace it back to you and assume you killed them. I lock my guns up, and I lock them up separately from my ammunition. \n\nWith all this said, I would not give that as a gift. That seems a little passive aggressive. Just be straight with him instead if you want to go that route. Say I want to do this and I want you to come with me. Be firm.\n\nAlthough, there is a better way. I have friends who have accidentally pointed guns at me. This has led to me yelling at them in a very serious manner. They do not try and tell me they know better because they know my experience trumps all their combine. So here's what I would do. Go to a local gun shop, and find a worker older than your husband (we have a harder time listening to younger men tell us how to do something) and tell them you want to practice at the range with your husband (you can rent guns at the counter usually). Tell them though, you have a husband that doesn't take gun safety seriously and that he has pointed a gun at you and told you it wasn't a big deal. Right away you will know if they are a good gun shop because they will be appalled. Ask this gentleman when he will be there and plan to go in when he's there. Ask him to watch like a hawk when you are there and get on your husbands case about safety. If your husband is dismissive about something you think is unsafe walk out of the range and talk to the older gentleman. He will likely come in and say something. There is nothing else like getting lectured by an expert when the person thinks they know it all. He will back down and change most likely. If not, ask the gentleman to recommend a gun course while you are both standing there. Then sign up on the spot. This will be much more likely to get him to change than the way you are thinking of going about it. Trust me on this. \n\n\nLastly, he needs a small safe. It can be bolted to the floor. Some are made for quick access and he can have a speed loader for his gun. He can be locked and loaded plenty quick if need be. This would be much safer setup, no drawers. Further, it sounds like you have been together a while. I would not leave him over this like many people say. Unless he becomes really unsafe which then you need to get out. However, I think you can both still grow and learn. I have taught people older than him. They didn't receive it well at first, but it eventually stuck. It's harder to learn something when we think we knew all about it our whole lives, but that doesn't mean change isn't possible.", "YWBTA if you didn't reflect seriously on your relationship.
