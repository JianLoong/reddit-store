Rent doesn't get you on the title.", "I assume that her income and credit were not used in the mortgage qualification process and that she is therefore not a borrower on the mortgage.

She's paying far less than market value and can use that windfall to build wealth. She's not entitled to a portion of your equity and certainly has no claim to your grandparent's gift. You are solely responsible for taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. She is an adult, adults pay rent unless **THEY** purchase a home. Personally, I would consider a prenup as it relates to the house if you do marry. Assuming that your home is nicer than your previous rental, she should be paying somewhat more than she was paying there. The amount of a landlord's mortgage is of no concern to a tenant. You aren't charging her more than half the cost of the mortgage, which would be patently unfair. My GF bought a house, I paid half of the mortgage cost which was significantly less than I would have paid renting anywhere else.", "NTA.  She\u2019s getting a good deal on her *rent* at your house (depending on how y\u2019all define \u2018mortgage payment\u2019).  Just don\u2019t expect her to chip in for the new roof or replacement appliances or anything else that is the responsibility of the landlord. She isn\u2019t getting any of the perks of ownership so she doesn\u2019t have the responsibilities.", "Info: do you plan on proposing soon?", "NAH\n\n\nJust tell her what you're open to now is having her be your tenant, nothing else. She can decide what she wants to do with that.", "NTA. The inheritance is yours and you are paying up front costs, then your agreement seems reasonable. There are a few topics worth discussing ahead of time though. \n1. When it comes to repairs and renovations, how much are you expecting her pay for. If she does end up investing a large amount of money in the renovations, it might be reasonable to have an agreement in place that she gets that money back if your relationship changes. This doesn't include decorations or furniture that she could take with her or sell.\n2.  Who would you want to inherit the house if you were to pass away? If you want it to be her, get a will done so she can feel safe in the idea that she won't lose her house along with her partner. This is probably where my concern would lie, I have seen it happen before.\n3.  It might be worth looking into the laws regarding common law spouses where you are. There may be other issues like the above worth discussing to help with her discomfort. \n\nGood luck and congrats on the house!", "NAH.\n\nMy girlfriend & I were in almost exactly the same situation. Her friends expressed concern that she'd also be putting sweat equity into a house I own that she might never benefit from.\n\nSo I paid 100% of the mortgage, which was my choice, and to mitigate some of her understandable concerns.  (Your gf paying 25% sounds pretty reasonable)\n\nIn the end, there's going to be some trust involved, but given the size and value of a house, we both agreed to her staying for free (my risk) and she put in a lot of work to fix up the house (her risk).\n\nWe got married a year later so she legally owns half now. It all turned out ok.", "NTA. It\u2019s reasonable not to put her on the deed until you\u2019re married. Definitely get her to sign a lease to protect yourself. \n\nAfter marriage though, I wouldn\u2019t want to continue living in that home and starting a family I had no ownership of. Tell her when you reach that point, you can have the discussion again.", "NTA if you two aren\u2019t ready to legally commit to each other, you\u2019re not ready to own a house together. \n\nI get where she\u2019s coming from but it would make more sense to either 1. let her live there for free because it\u2019s your house and she\u2019s your girlfriend or 2. Make her a legal tenant and draw up a lease.", "NAH. What you\u2019ve proposed is FAIR. 25% of the mortgage payment is likely less than half of the monthly interest amount, so she would not be paying into the principle. \n\nAt the same time I wouldn\u2019t feel great about paying rent to my partner of 5 years. You certainly don\u2019t owe her a house, but after this amount of time, you should be making decisions about where you will live as a joint decision and now you\u2019re purchasing this house on your own.\n\nThat makes things more complicated, but when you are committed to someone things do become more complicated. \n\nIn other words, whether or not you are married I would expect you to act with a degree of commitment anyway. If you expect to be engaged eventually, sharing your home rent-free for a year or so makes a lot of sense as a measure of good faith for where this is going. In the grand scheme of things and when buying a ~$500k home, it is a sensible decision.", "NTA.  She wants 50% equity while investing less than 25%.  Which is a GREAT deal...for her.", "NAH I think 25% is fair in exchange for not being on the deed but after 5 years together this might be a deal breaker for her and that's understandable too. Out of curiosity do you guys have a timeline for getting engaged and married in the future?", "Info: where do you see your relationship going, and when (if) do you see getting married? \n\nShe is NOT entitled to your inheritance, but I wouldn\u2019t have been okay with such a clear statement of \u201cyou\u2019re only a (for now) girlfriend\u201d after 5 years of dating.

Similar to graduating - are we breaking up or getting engaged?", "She's not contributing to the down-payment and is getting a greatly reduced rent price in addition? I struggle to understand where she feels she has a leg to stand on. Are there other shared assets you haven't mentioned? Nta based on everything you've said.", "NAH as long as everyone has clear expectations.\n\nI hope you're not expecting her to clean the entire house.", "NTA. I'm guessing you both are renting now. So I'm not sure how from her going from renting where she lives now to renting from you (at a much cheaper rate if I'm understanding right) she can \"get screwed\" out of this arrangement. If you break up, she continues to pay rent to someone. If you get married she gets added to the title.", "NTA. I bought my first house using inheritance as a down payment. I met my husband after owning it and he lived there with me for like 8 years. I never put his name on the deed. If we broke up for some reason, I didn't want him to take the house from me or have to buy him out considering he never paid into equity, maintenance, taxes, etc. \n\nShe's taking no risks and not paying into the ownership of the house so she should not be asking for her name on the deed. Especially considering you're not married or even engaged.", "NTA. \n\nIt would be different if the two of you had paid for the house together, but you've bought it yourself and she's essentially paying rent. \n\nI'd wonder a little about why she thinks you would somehow take advantage of this. If this was a concern she probably shouldn't have agreed to move in together in the first place, since she previously agreed to this solution. Maybe sit down and talk to her about it again, find out why she's gotten this concern between when you last talked it over and now.", "NTA and do not put her name on the deed.", "NTA, protect yourself just in case, think of it as life insurance you buy it just in case, do not put her on deed", "Info: are you gonna ask her to pay for any upkeep or repairs of the house?", "NTA.  I might consider another financial arrangement though, where she's not contributing to the mortgage of the home you own.  Like, half of the property taxes and utilities, etc. Just a thought.", "NTA. Basic fairness: if she's got no liability from the mortgage, she doesn't get to benefit from the asset. \n\nMy bf wanted to be on the deed the house when I bought it, but the bank refused to put him on the mortgage so I declined to put him on the deed. Best way I've ever ended a relationship. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. If you two get married, you should revisit this. However, at this point I think you\u2019re being very reasonable.", "NTA - She's not paying for it, it's not hers. I would also make her sign a lease. She seems entitled.", "Uh no you are not. You've got to cover yourself. Just make sure she isn't helping with the down or payments and she'll have no claim to it legally (25 percent is what she could be entitled to if she's regularly paying it, depends on where you are), which is correct when you aren't married.", "After 5 years no. I spent 15 years with ex he bought a house and I had no legal rights to it and his will left it to his sister. So after 15 years of being his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d I left him.

She can just not move in if she feels she is getting screwed.", "[deleted]", "NTA -- you would be making her a 50K gift.   But be aware in most states, without a prenup, even if she is not on the title, the property may be marital property (as you are paying the mortgage out of earnings while married).", "NTA - you are doing the correct and mature thing.", "NTA! Do NOT put her on the deed until after marriage. I can*not* stress this enough.\n\nStandard disclaimers: I am an attorney, I am not YOUR attorney, I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m licensed for where you are. This is general legal common sense, and if you feel you need true legal advice, speak to a licensed attorney in your area. \n\nOkay, now that that\u2019s out of the way.\n\nDo you have any idea how many clients I\u2019ve had that were completely screwed over thanks to deciding to put their not-married partner on the title of a major financial purchase? People who at the time swore they were in it for the long haul and that their 5-year relationship was as good as being married?\n\nOr how much of a pain in the ass it is to untangle the lives of the ones who aren\u2019t totally screwed over? That \u201clong term\u201d relationship ends, and suddenly this person has just as much right to possess your property as you do I.e. *you can\u2019t evict them*.
