Beth recently did some incredibly out of line hurtful things to Amy and I'm trying to make sense of how to work through it all.\n\nIt started when Amy's niece, Callie (16f) confided in my wife that she had recently lost her virginity to her boyfriend (17m). Amy had a serious discussion with her about safety, protection, consent, and how to tell her parents (Amy's sister, Debra (44f)). Amy warned Callie if she doesn't find a way to talk to her parents herself, they're going to find out some other (worse) way, and that she would respect Callie's trust in her and not tell Debra unless she felt Callie was doing anything unsafe (no protection, abuse, etc).\n\nAmy told Beth about the conversation with her niece, and Beth was immediately against Amy's decision. She felt that Debra needed to be told right away, that this child's safety was worth way more than the trust and relationship between Amy and Callie. She cited concerns about grooming, defiance of faith (Beth and Callie/Debra live in Christian households, and a younger Beth experienced \"fatherless behavior\" and its consequences), and how unsafe it was to keep this secret from the child's parents.\n\nTwo weeks passed after Amy told Beth, and Amy gets a call from Callie. Callie's parents had found out from a woman who called Debra crying, distraught about the concern she had for Callie and the danger she felt she was in. Callie's parents were hurt, disappointed, and Callie was basically super grounded. Amy immediately tried reaching out to Beth to ask if she was the one who called Debra. At first Beth would not respond to texts or calls, but later that evening Beth responded through text that yes, it had been her, and if it causes them to part ways she understands. Amy is immediately hurt at this betrayal and \"break up\", and tries to understand why Beth did it, and how Beth could simply suggest \"if you can't forgive me, then this is where we go separate ways.\" Beth went on to say that she felt Amy was an unsafe adult, that she didn't want her (or me) around her family, and that she felt Amy was a horrible person. You know, the very sort of thing you never hope to hear from the person you entrusted with your deepest vulnerabilities and insecurities.\n\nOnce Beth had felt she gave enough reasoning she (and her husband) went on to block/delete Amy (and me) on all platforms, as well as all mutual friends. Amy's world is shattered, of course. Beth was her Maid of Honor in our wedding (which we haven't even gotten photos back on yet, so that's salt in the wound looming on the horizon), and we had already shared with Beth that we planned to name one of our children in her honor.\n\nSo AITA for telling my wife her best friend was a deceiving, misguided woman, whose selfishness caused harm to Amy's family because she couldn't keep her morals and \"guilt\" to herself?", "created_utc": 1695747843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16stk1u/aita_for_encouraging_my_wife_to_let_go_fo_her/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Beth is a nasty piece of trash and your wife needs to see this. And yea, rethink that naming your children bit.", "No. You were completely on point.\n\nYou wife did absolutely nothing wrong. She did everything is exactly the right way that a good and caring person should do when she's been given the confidence of another.\n\nHer friend however, for what her reason, broke not only your wife's confidence but also the confidence of Callie.\n\nRight now, your wife is hurt, but she needs to know that despite their history, her friend has shown her that she is not to be trusted and, from her ongoing behaviour, that she's not the kind of person your wife needs to be associated with.\n\nYour wife needs to flip this. Right now, sh'e being smeared as the bad one. It's not true.\n\nReassure her. Tell her over and over that sh's not to blame. In time, she will see exactly what has happened but right now she's in shock. \n\nOf COURSE your wife needs to let her go. She doesn't deserve the friendship of your wife. Right now she's trying to manipulate the whole situation and blame your wife. It's nonsense.\n\nYour wife did nothing wrong.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Her actions were completely out of line and toxic, she deserves to be let go. If she doesn't even feel remorse for ruining your wife's relationship with her niece, how would your wife forgive that? It was none of her business, literally. Also, calling Callie's parents CRYING is so cringy I can't even. \n\nAnd to be honest, what she did actually invites more trouble. Up until this point Callie at least had an adult she felt safe confiding in, so if something bad was going on, your wife would probably learn it firsthand. Now she will trust no one, but still find ways do her thing, as all teenagers do.", "NTA, however your wife should not have disclosed anything Callie told her to anyone else. She broke Callie\u2019s trust by sharing that information with Beth - who completely destroyed everything in return. For what Callie shared there is no one that Amy should have discussed that with at all other than Callie. I know she felt safe to tell Beth, but if Callie had felt safe to tell anyone else that would be hers to tell. While Beth has done extensive damage - things may never be the same between Amy and Callie.  \n\nBeth needs to be dropped and Amy needs to tell Beth herself !! And why. I\u2019m sure Beth will find a way ti rationalize or justify herself to herself - it may not be punishment to Beth but it will be healthier for Amy to get rid of such a person from her life.", "NTA\n\nParents like Beth create children who lie and dont trust their parents.", "You're not the asshole for expressing your concerns about Beth's actions to your wife. You were supporting your wife and providing your perspective on a difficult situation. However, it's essential to remember that the main issue here is the conflict between Amy and Beth, not your involvement in the situation.  \nBeth's actions and betrayal deeply hurt your wife, and your wife has every right to feel the way she does. It's natural for you to want to console and support your spouse during this challenging time.", "NTA\n\n Beth was in your life too, I mean you were going to name your child after her. You are allowed to express your opinion about how YOU don't want this person in your life, you don't want her knowing your business, acting as if she is the morality police and betraying your trust. \n\n Honestly I am baffled why your wife would want this woman still in her life. Does the title of \"best friend\" wipe out Beth's betrayal? Your wife will need to mourn the loss of the friendship but this friend sounds like a nightmare and it's good to be rid of her.", "NTA. Sadly I think you guys were friends with a religious wacko based on the language she used to justify this.", "Absolutely NTA.  In fact, the best thing Amy can do is leave her friendship with Beth in the past.  Amy respected Cassie's confidence, which was the right thing to do.  Beth betrayed Amy's confidence in favor of righteous superiority, which is completely ego driven.  Beth is a huge AH.  I hope Cassie knows she can still rely on her aunt Amy for support and guidance.", "NTA and honestly your wife should be upset yes, but not sad. That women is a piece of work and good riddance.", "NTA. Beth sounds a little psycho.", "Beth sounds like a nutter. NTA and your wife cannot be friends with someone who is so judgmental of her and also cannot be trusted. There's no relationship to be had without trust and acceptance.  FWIW as the mother of a teenager, Amy's advice was sound and Beth is not a good person.", "NTA. We should always encourage our partners to be and do better, and if in your case that involves talking her down from horrible friends then it's pretty much your duty to do so.", "ESH but your wife's friend is far worse, by doing what she did- obviously, and your wife will hopefully come to terms with the idea that Beth is judging her far too harshly and that not having a person like that in your life is AOK, though she may need to mourn that friendship and the loss of a potential friendship future with her.\n\nBut- your wife should not have told anyone Callie's business, and THAT ended up being harmful to Callie. Your wife was the trusted adult who did everything right, until she didn't keep that secret. She also knew her friend's history and faith if they've been friends this long and it was naive of her to think that wouldn't be a risk. \n\nBeth sucks, for sure. But your wife needs to learn a lesson about keeping family business private if she wants to be seen as someone trustworthy.", "ESH (except you and Cassie). \n\nAmy made a huge mistake in telling Beth about Cassie. It betrayed her niece's privacy. Beth was totally out of line for telling Cassie's parents. And if Any knew Beth was a Holy Roller who sees premarital sex as a sin, why on earth did she tell her about Cassie?", "honestly,though,your wife shouldnt have told her 'friend'her nieces private information..", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
