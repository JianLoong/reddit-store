You just weren't going to pay for him (especially given the last-minute pricing). That's totally fair. It's unfair for your wife to just simply outright refuse to go to her DAUGTHER'S BIRTHDAY because her bf won't pay for his ticket to go with her.   \n\n\nAlso, if she wants your daughter to go visit for a few weeks in the summer instead, maybe that should be a conversation for the three of you all together. And it's not the worst case scenario separate from this situation.

I don't even know a word for it. Disgusting, maybe? This is the kind of thing I'd expect from a college girl getting help from her parents, or at least a young adult who's single, childless and sufficiently independent.

Also your wife is extra TA for blowing off her daughter\u2019s birthday for that reason.", "NTA, but time to move on. My mom went back to work when I was twelve but somehow didn't feel the need to leave my dad and us. Your wife is selfish.", "Omg NTA get a divorce already. Go find an attorney. Stop sending her money. Why tf would you pay for her boyfriend. Does your daughter know what's going on? She should be paying child support to you. This situation is odd. Please find an attorney and file for full custody and child support. Do NOT send her a dime. This is ridiculous.", "Are your balls comfortable in her purse?   \n\n\nMy friend, you need therapy and you need a good divorce lawyer. She's got you by the throat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "Dude, as someone who was pressured into an open marriage and was aggressively fine about it and cool and supportive and positive to all our friends\u2026. It\u2019s not fine. And you don\u2019t have to be okay with it to be modern and enlightened. You\u2019ve put up with a lot and now you\u2019re drawing a beyond reasonable boundary and being told you\u2019re not supportive enough. I hope this is the limit for your and you get out. Mine was when I was told that the fact that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with my spouse and their gf having sex in our bed while she was visiting was me being \u201ctoo controlling\u201d.", "Call me old fashioned but I draw my line in the sand when my wife has a boyfriend.", "Tell your daughter that her mom *has a ticket*. Her mom has a ticket and if she chooses to not use it to see daughter on her birthday then you can\u2019t *make* her use it. Tell your daughter you are sorry if that is what happens. \n\nDude. Your marriage is over, you and your daughter have been abandoned and are worthless, (except for the money you are giving your living-her-best-life-with-her-BF-on-a-different-continent-ex-in-everything-but-name).\n\nI am so sorry. Get a lawyer. Get a therapist. NTA, except to yourself.", "I wish I could upvote this more than once", "OP I really do hope you see that comment. While I agree with others that I'm not sure that's the best way to approach your daughter the fact people are divided on how to really shows that you need professional level assistance here. I might say therapist then a lawyer. The therapist is long past due and your daughter could use one too. Your wife's handling of this situation shows it is time for a lawyer. You have been doormat level of accommodating and I can sort of understand why but if you aren't ready for a lawyer you still very much need a professional to help you and your daughter navigate this.", "No, he should not tell his daughter that. She\u2019s a kid and doesn\u2019t need to be involved in the breakdown of her parents\u2019 marriage. She needs to be protected from the stress and any vitriol. We don\u2019t encourage shit-talking parents to kids even when they\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s not a good look.\n\nOP please get a book or two on parenting a kid during a breakup. It will teach you great ways to engage with them such as the art of deflection that directly fosters conversation. You can help your daughter advocate for herself and learn to establish and maintain boundaries. She\u2019s gonna need to know and it\u2019s on you as the full-time parent to set her up for success.", "This.", "Might not be too confusing as she probably thinks that her parents are fully separated but her dad just haven't moved on yet. Since I'm fairly certain the wife doesn't want to be with him until she's ready to retire.", "OP needs to see this. You are becoming too naive who tolerates everything making you an asshole. You should talk to your daughter, she's not that young who can't understand the situation. She's starting to be an ass and I fear that she might follow her mother's footsteps.\n\nESH.", "Yep, this right here - ESH. We know the \u201cwife\u201d sucks, but OP is just as bad for refusing to acknowledge the writing on the wall in a way that\u2019s impacting his relationship with his child in a potentially dangerous way.\n\nI think OP needs to realize that people who actually love each other want to grow together, not separately. If your \u201cwife\u201d actually loved you, she wouldn\u2019t be on the other side of the world, in a relationship with another man, trying to find herself; she\u2019d be here, figuring out the next phase of her life with you. \n\nI would also caution OP not to be so naive re his daughter. Not only is OP allowing the \u201cwife\u201d to alienate him from the daughter, he\u2019s agreeing to send his daughter abroad to see the mom with no real way of actually getting her back. It sounds to me like she\u2019s probably planning on a parental kidnapping to keep the kid with her and continue to use OP as leverage for money.", "You're 100 percent  correct. It's sad that he doesn't even see it.", "I don't understand this cuckold mentality of his.", "Right?!  The minute he said that I was like \u201cdude? You blind?\u201d", "Daughter is a 13 year old teenager and she's not too young to understand that her mother is the one who abandoned them. There's nothing wrong with him telling her that her mother has a ticket that she's refusing to use. Your answer is bullshit. He needs to divorce the mother and get the kid a therapist.", "That only works for parents that are on the same page. My relationship with my daughter is ruined because I took the high road and tried to follow \"the books\",  and my shit-talking ex-spouse didn't, and poisoned my relationship with my daughter because of them lying to her for years.", "Red flag\ud83d\udea9#1 Wife just up and left to travel wherever, whenever with no thought to the responsibilities of home. She has a child ffs. \nRed flag \ud83d\udea9 #2 SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND?!  And you\u2019re okay with this?  I mean that\u2019s fine if that works for you. But the audacity that you should pay for her boyfriend to come see your daughter?\n\nYou and your daughter have been abandoned by your wife. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re refusing to see it or not, but that\u2019s what this is. \n\nYour daughter is 13. Everything is your fault to her. It\u2019s easy and convenient to blame the parent right in front of her and not her mother, who is easy to ignore because there\u2019s no emotional connection. \n\nRemind your daughter that you bought her mother a ticket but she\u2019s choosing not to come. While I wouldn\u2019t say this to your daughter - the reality is your wife has chosen her *boyfriend* over her daughter. \n\nGet a therapist, get a lawyer, divorce her and stop funding her permanent vacation", "Totally agree with you. This happened to me. Tried to protect kids lied to them to cover for their father. Little did I know he did everything he could to put me down and destroyed my relationship. My eldest son now 25 has told me some awful things he thought were true cos his dad had told him", "Completely untrue and if he ends up in court it will be immediately used against him. Family court cares very much about parents not shit-talking each other and it\u2019s one of the fastest ways to lose custodial time.\n\nAgain, there are ways to approach it gently and safely with children, I assure you. This smacks of projection due to your own history. Being child-centered means you stay carefully neutral, stay supportive of the child, never gaslight them or discount their feelings but instead redirect their questions in ways that help them reason out the truth themselves. You can acknowledge problems without being nasty about a parent they likely love even when they shouldn\u2019t.\n\nSource: me, a child of emotional abuse and divorce. Also me, trying to divorce an abusive man for 3.5 years and having been through the wringer with family court and had a NCO against my ex.  \n\nOP - trust me when I tell you not to sling mud or put down her mom no matter how tempted you may be.", "I'm not saying to not approach it gently. I'm just saying that it is important even for a thirteen year old to know the facts, such as they are. I never said to \"sling mud\". I just said that if one party is doing that, it's not necessarily going to work out in favor of the parent who isn't. \n\nYou can take the high road, do everything right, and still come off as the bad guy because a lying manipulator is going to keep doing what they are doing.\n\nMy ex was a manipulator. They decided, unilaterally, to have an open relationship. My situation was fairly close to OPs, and I took the high road, deflected, let the kids reason it out themselves. My ex didn't. We got divorced, and I ended up with custody. My daughter listened to every poisoned barb my ex spewed out about me when they were together, and I still haven't been able to repair my relationship with my daughter 15 years later. I haven't met my own grandchild.\n\nThe courts in my state don't really care about shit-talking. I wish they did. I'd be in a much better spot now with my daughter.\n\nAnyhow, all this to say that I don't disagree with you in theory, but just understand that it takes both parents to actually care about the kids in a situation like that, and I don't see that here."]}
