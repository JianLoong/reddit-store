He has been with her current greek boyfriend for six months.\n\nThe issue is that she was meant to come home for a few days so she could be at our daughter's thirteenth birthday. I had already buy her a ticket but then she decided she wanted her boyfriend to come to. I have no problem with him coming but I didn't think I should be the one paying for his ticket. Specially so late becuase it would be more expensive. As soon as I complained, she just said she is not coming anymore because she doesn't think I could be mature enough to handle the situation and she prefers for me to send our daughter to visit her for a few weeks during summer.\n\nI tried to negotiate with her but she was not fully set in her new idea and didn't care about anything I had to say. Now my daughter is angry at me because she was really looking forward to seeing her mom and because of me she will have to wait for months. I don't think it is fair to blame me and I feel it is cruel that my daughter is now being so cold with me. I also miss my wife and I am sad she is not coming but me daughter thinks this is something I did on purpose because I am jealous of her new boyfriend.

You just weren't going to pay for him (especially given the last-minute pricing). That's totally fair. It's unfair for your wife to just simply outright refuse to go to her DAUGTHER'S BIRTHDAY because her bf won't pay for his ticket to go with her.   \n\n\nAlso, if she wants your daughter to go visit for a few weeks in the summer instead, maybe that should be a conversation for the three of you all together. And it's not the worst case scenario separate from this situation.

I don't even know a word for it. Disgusting, maybe? This is the kind of thing I'd expect from a college girl getting help from her parents, or at least a young adult who's single, childless and sufficiently independent.

But now his daughter is suffering from her two parents either being selfish or incredibly naive and foolish. \n\nDon't wanna be that guy but yeah it's time to pull the plug and file for divorce. \n\nOP's \"wife\" is perfectly content with getting railed by other guys around the world instead of being with her daughter and husband for YEARS so OP is gonna have to get his head outta his ass and divorce her for the sake of his daughter's wellbeing and his own.\n\nI've been on AITA too much lately and maybe this post isn't even real but if the \"wife\" wanted her boy toy to come so bad maybe she's pregnant. Based off this post OP would be foolish enough to \"step up\" and help with the child, smh.", "lol. I love the ESH you and the replies on your comment have put forth. It reeks of man hating. Were the situation reversed, nobody would be calling a naive woman an asshole along with the cheating partner. But since it\u2019s a naive man, sure, let\u2019s call him an asshole also.", "He is 100% delusional if he honestly believes that \"things will go back to what they were before\". They NEVER will! She only says that so OP keeps giving her his money, while she fucks who she wants wherever she wants. She doesn't give two shits about her \"marriage\". The second she is back (if she ever comes back) she will divorce him.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Being abandoned by a manipulative parent and the other parent just going along with it\u2026\n\nOP, how would you feel if your daughter\u2019s future spouse did this to her?", "[removed]", "Let\u2019s just address the obvious. The kid is 13. She knows her mom had a ticket. She knows the holdup is the bf\u2019s ticket. She knows her mom chose her bf over her. REMINDING her isn\u2019t going to help. \n\nShe\u2019s a barely teen who has been abandoned by her mom for 2 years. She is fully aware her mom is a fuckup. But that still hurts to say. It still hurts to acknowledge that your mom chose volunteering in Europe over you, for two years and counting. Dad is getting beat up because dad is the only parent she knows won\u2019t ALSO leave her if she doesn\u2019t act perfect. It is, actually, sort of awesome that she knows she can be angry or hurt or even hurtful to her dad, and he\u2019s going to stay. Because she knows, all to well, not all parents are like that. \n\nSometimes when you are a parent, you take the hurt so your kid won\u2019t. Much better to have her (temporarily and irrationally) mad at you than drill down to just how few shits her mom gives about her. I know it hurts OP, but that anger is just because she does feel safe expressing that her mom. She\u2019ll either go to Greece in the summer and be reminded first hand how worthless her mom is, or more likely, that won\u2019t work out either. Especially when you know she\u2019s about to be hurt *again* in 6 more months, you really gotta take it on the chin now to save her. The anger will dissipate in a day or two, the trauma of knowing your mom doesn\u2019t care is going to last a lifetime, so let her have her anger.", "Upvoted for you a second time.\n\nShe has left everything but the money behind, including the daughter. This whole dynamic is not at all healthy for the daughter to be dealing with as well. \n\nHis wife is not \u201cgoing to come back to normal eventually once she feel she is ready to move on from this new stage of her life.\u201d This is her new normal, and there is no way she is going to come back from touring all of Europe and experiencing all the men therein. \n\nOP may be older, but he is way more naive.", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/Primary-Criticism929 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106iifr/aita_for_not_buying_a_plane_ticket_so_my_wife/j3goopd/\n\nBot Reported.", "There is a difference between trash talking a parent and refusing to lie to the child by accepting blame for the other parent\u2019s bad behavior *when it affects the child*. This is absolutely the latter.", "You cannot protect a child from a manipulative parent by hiding the truth. It only hurts them in the long run. They need the child appropriate amount of truth to help them navigate the manipulations and disappointments", "That ship has sailed when the 13 yo somehow is aware mom\u2019s got a boyfriend and is blaming her father for jealousy.", "BS. OP shouldn't be treated like crap just to protect mommy's feelings and 13 is old enough to understand what is going on.", "Still, her daughter\u2019s birthday seems like a totally inappropriate time to introduce her to her new boyfriend.", "Yep. ESH. \n\nOP u/WeakBattle2I: You're also risking your daughter's safety by allowing strange men around your daughter. There is a high risk of assault here. Statistics say it's almost always someone the girl knows but isn't related or that close to her. \n\nDo NOT let your wife bring strange men around your daughter. She might be a fool, but you better grow a backbone for the sake of your daughter.", "I can't speak for others but I sure as hell can tell you that if the husband was the one Who abandoned hus child, or if we were talking about a same sex relationship, both partners would be assholes in my opinion.", "Honestly I don't think she ever will divorce him. I mean think about it, she has absolutely nothing to do with him anyway, but gets money from him, willingly. Who would give that up? Their marriage is just a piece of paper.", "Or the daughter could buy the ticket if it so okay for her that mom has a new bf and dad needs to pay for him", "Comment stolen from: /u/FuzzyThantos87 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106iifr/aita_for_not_buying_a_plane_ticket_so_my_wife/j3goej4/\n\nBot Reported.", "Actually, she probably will.

It\u2019s so manipulative and ironic", "She can be helped to understand that without anger and shit-talking. She sounds like the type to take him to court and the child is old enough to be heard in said court so dad needs to protect her and himself from his shitty wife. The court doesn\u2019t give a shit how bad the parent is. The second she claims PA and the court finds out he has trashed mom in ANY way it will not go well. This is about protecting her *from* shit custody.\n\nMy answer is not bullshit. He needs to get the daughter a therapist and divorce the mom - total agreement. Nobody will tell him to trash her mom. They will help her discover the path for herself in a way that does not make her feel torn between anyone.\n\nEdit: typo \n\nETA: \u201cI\u2019d hoped your mom would be able to come as well, sweetheart. Unfortunately that won\u2019t be possible so let\u2019s make sure we make it the best day possible for you.\u201d  Easy. No trashing the other parent.", "Yes, but when (if) she comes back, she would have to fullfill the \"promise\" she made of going back to normal. She wouldn't have any more excuses to stay away, so she would either have to go back, or to divorce him. And when she would get allimony, because she's not making any money. But honestly? She's not coming back anyway.", "Safety nets and other fall protection devices must be replaced periodically. If they are not, they may fail when needed. Hopefully OP\u2019s safety net will be removed for replacement very soon.", "Assuming they\u2019re poly. Well, I guess they are - like it or not", "The chill poly people aren't in \"the community\" for exactly that reason lol. Been poly for years and years, never had an issue. Not a big deal, we rarely have time to date anymore.", "Telling the truth isn\u2019t trashing them. Saying that the mom has a ticket but isn\u2019t coming is a truth.\nAdding commentary to it would be talking shit. It\u2019s impacting his relationship with his daughter and she is old enough to understand. It can be done without dragging her into their problems.", "Lying to the kid to pretend the mother cares about her isn't doing her any favors.", "But that's not the truth. It IS possible. The mom is choosing not to come.   \n\n\nBy lying and saying that she is not able to come, the OP is laying himself open to accusations of a lying at a later point and manipulation on the part of the wife.", "Dude is huffing copium.", "They know deep inside. Maybe she's mad that dad still pretending all is good. I was pretending, for my son's sake. He was only five. Till he told me, when we were petting and feeding a feral cat  - my dad is like this cat, he comes to see us to get pet and play dad, Then go back to his stuff and give no news for six months.
