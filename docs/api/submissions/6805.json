We are not getting a divorce and she says everything is going to come back to normal eventually once she feels she is ready to move on from this new stage of her life.\n\nShe now lives travelling across Europe doing different ways of charity work and environmental activism. She has had many small jobs during her travels, mainly as a waitress, but I also still help her a lot. Our marriage is now open sexually and romantically. I haven't been with any other women yet but I may do it if I find the right one. At first she was just with random men but she eventually started having more stable relationships. She has been with her current greek boyfriend for six months.\n\nThe issue is that she was meant to come home for a few days so she could be at our daughter's thirteenth birthday. I had already buy her a ticket but then she decided she wanted her boyfriend to come too. I have no problem with him coming but I didn't think I should be the one paying for his ticket. Specially so late because it would be more expensive. As soon as I complained, she just said she is not coming anymore because she doesn't think I could be mature enough to handle the situation and she prefers for me to send our daughter to visit her for a few weeks during summer.\n\nI tried to negotiate with her but she was not fully set in her new idea and didn't care about anything I had to say. Now my daughter is angry at me because she was really looking forward to seeing her mom and because of me she will have to wait for months. I don't think it is fair to blame me and I feel it is cruel that my daughter is now being so cold with me. I also miss my wife and I am sad she is not coming but me daughter thinks this is something I did on purpose because I am jealous of her new boyfriend.

You just weren't going to pay for him (especially given the last-minute pricing). That's totally fair. It's unfair for your wife to just simply outright refuse to go to her DAUGTHER'S BIRTHDAY because her bf won't pay for his ticket to go with her.   \n\n\nAlso, if she wants your daughter to go visit for a few weeks in the summer instead, maybe that should be a conversation for the three of you all together. And it's not the worst case scenario separate from this situation.

I don't even know a word for it. Disgusting, maybe? This is the kind of thing I'd expect from a college girl getting help from her parents, or at least a young adult who's single, childless and sufficiently independent.

But now his daughter is suffering from her two parents either being selfish or incredibly naive and foolish. \n\nDon't wanna be that guy but yeah it's time to pull the plug and file for divorce. \n\nOP's \"wife\" is perfectly content with getting railed by other guys around the world instead of being with her daughter and husband for YEARS so OP is gonna have to get his head outta his ass and divorce her for the sake of his daughter's wellbeing and his own.\n\nI've been on AITA too much lately and maybe this post isn't even real but if the \"wife\" wanted her boy toy to come so bad maybe she's pregnant.

Sometimes us parents have to be a lightning rod and absorb our child's anger even if it's not our fault.  We do it because we love our kids and know one day they'll understand.   Quit with all the guilty feelings you're nothing to feel guilty about except treating yourself like crap and let your wife do this to you and the daughter.   If you can't do that for yourself at least do that for your daughter she deserves better than what she's getting from both of you.  Be the one parent that she can count on that will have her back and her safety in mind even if it makes her mad.   If you have any reservations about her mom really wanting to see her.... her mom already had a plane ticket PAID FOR and could not even jump on a plane because her boy for 6 MONTHS couldn't come!!!  Have you ever thought of maybe the boy toy is so broke he can't afford his own plane ticket and your financing the couple banging for 6 months so she tells the boy toy that you'll pay for it or maybe she's just thinking you're just pathetic she's thinking about how far she can go and push you for money before you break?  Why would you want to spend your life miserable like that why would you want to show your daughter being miserable like that is normal????? \n\nDude you need to get mad really really mad.  You need to stand up dust yourself off start making some arrangements to protect you and your daughter you don't deserve any of the treatment you're getting but you are an asshole to yourself for letting it go on this long.

It seems to me you're the only one working while your paying her for the privilege of being treated horribly and continuously drained of money.  It's almost like you're going through the grieving process I think deep down you know your marriage is over you just don't want to come to terms with it.  You need to act dude there's never going to be a right time to start standing up for yourself it starts now and it starts with you.

Daughter might be equally angry at father because she sees him, rightly, as a doormat. He has clearly failed to advocate for himself, it's not a stretch to think he's failed to advocate for daughter.\n\nI think the one thing we can agree upon is father is an invertebrate. No spine at all.", "Dad is definitely the safety net here and I'm grateful the daughter has the security in her situation to be angry. No, it's not fair, but it's temporary. Her mom isn't exactly home for her to express her anger where it's actually aimed because she abandoned her child.\n\nWhat a selfish horrible women. Get a lawyer. You and your daughter deserve so much better.", "This is so well stated.", "This comment is accurate, beautiful, and needs to be higher.", "God, OPs daughter is going to end up with such a messed up idea of what relationships are supposed to be lie.  She knows her mom has the boyfriend, she knows her mom could come, she's mad that her dad won't pay for the boyfriend because \"he's jealous\".  That girl is 13 and her mom has already taught her that it is totally reasonable to just run off and abandon your family so you can sleep with random people and that if your family isn't on board with it, it is their fault. Like, what are the daughter's relationships going to be like when she gets older?  What would she be like if she becomes a mom.  Her mother has just set the most messed up standards of wife and mother for this kid and she's already falling for it.  OP definitely should have called it quits when his wife decided she needed to go find herself with other men instead of agreeing to stay in a dead marriage.", "This is defo one of those \"open\" relationships where one spouse forced it on the other who accepted it b/c they knew spouse was going to cheat regardless, and is trying to put a brave face on it.\n\nOP should check out [Chumplady.com](https://Chumplady.com), a site for betrayed spouses. It's got plenty of this type of stories, he'll feel right at home--and supported.", "Pretty sure I spelled that out quite clearly in all of my comments.", "Sounds like mother has been texting daughter to till the soil and plant that seed, rather than mom 'fessing up to abandoning daughter.", "really it sounds like this BF wants a free trip to the States (or where ever OP lives) and/or  OP's Ex doesn't trust this BF enough to be away from him for a week. Who knows how she explained her situation to this dude but if she was truthful he thinks it's fine to be steady with a woman who is still married and abandoned her child.", "I would be very hesitant to let my daughter go there for the summer too. I would be afraid that my wife would file for divorce once the daughter (and accompanying child support) are there.", "Exactly this too. OP has no information on what his wife\u2019s life is actually like over there, outside of what little she shares to seemingly break his spirit. As a parent, I would be incredibly hard pressed to let an unaccompanied 13 year old travel to a different country to stay with a parent who abandoned her and a boyfriend I\u2019ve never engaged with. It\u2019s a huge safety issue for multiple reasons.", "Likewise. And right now, it's not because he's naive that's why he's an AH. It's because he's modelling to his daughter that this is what a healthy relationship looks like.", "I disagree with the judgement that she railroaded him, if only because I don't think there's enough information to draw that conclusion. At least in the post itself, please feel free to correct me if he's elaborated in comments.", "Just the fact that you spent the time to comment is enough of an award. Thank you buddy!", "It\u2019s easier to blame OP since  making him feel bad works because he cares, unlike mom who has checked out.", "OP seems more worried about his marriage, his potential future girlfriend and his finances than his daughter and the impact this is having on her.", "I\u2019m making the assumption as a former teen girl with many teen girl (and now adult) friends. She may ALSO be angry with her dad for being a doormat, but that\u2019s a different question and issue. The poster above is saying to explain that her mom is a deadbeat and didn\u2019t choose to come home, and I am saying, she already knows that. That\u2019s why she\u2019s angry. And dad has to suck it up because that\u2019s parenting, especially when you allow this nebulous situation to continue and don\u2019t give your kid the stability they need and crave.  \n\nHe isn\u2019t THE asshole, but he\u2019s part of an overall situation full of AH, and thus, he has the stink of AH on him. But it is time for him to realize that this isn\u2019t temporary; he isn\u2019t in an open marriage, or even a marriage; he just has a ring. I think he\u2019s getting there.", "ESH. But I suspect that once he involves therapy and a lawyer, she will be jolted back into coming back to him and everyone will be miserable especially OP and his daughter.  Its best that she stays in Greece with her adonis before he switches her up with a younger model.   Good luck as you're going to need it.", "It's not PA if it's true...similar to libel / slander.\n\nTruth of accusation is a complete defense.", "he hasn't commented at all, it just doesn't sound like he's thrilled about his wife jetting off to backpack round Europe for two years instead of being a mum. the fact that he hasn't attempted to date, while she has had multiple partners, also suggests to me that he doesn't really want to", "OP as safety net SHOULD be rotted to the point of instant failure upon deployment.", "Pretty sure I spelled that out on all of my comments including with an example.", "Here\u2019s hoping, if for nobody else\u2019s sake but his daughter.", "**\\^\\^\\^stealing this**"]}
