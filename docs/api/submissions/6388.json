I have to say he doesn't get out of his way to be mean unless his feelings are hurt. He suffers from inability to handle stressful situations.\n\n\nHe and My 12 yrs old aren't close because of that and other reasons. I tried to talk to my husband about having unrealistic expectations of my son like wanting him to call him dad.\n\n\nThis christmas, my son gifted me a family phot of me, him, and his dad. I thought that was really nice but as soon as my husband saw it. He started throwing a fit about being excluded and how my son doesn't consider him family. I told him it's a gift and he shouldn't push it but he proceeded to rip that photo (it had flower decoratiobs and some art work was done on it) into tiny pieces. I was shaken up from this. I yelled at him and called him insane to do that and ruin my son's gift for me. He defended himself saying my son mae a mistake to exclude him and that I shouldn't have encouraged it let alone call HIM insane for being hurt. I told him I couldn't imagine how hurt my son would feel if he saw what was done but he replied with \"he can and will get over it, just like I was told to get over being exluded\".\n\n\nThe argument got bigger and his family sided with him saying his behavior was justified because what was he supposed to do when me and my son treated him like 2nd class citizen. They said I was wrong to call him insane and make light of his mental health.\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672767502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102e43w/aita_for_calling_my_husband_insane_after_he/", "score": 932, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was your property, not his. He has zero right to do anything to your personal property. He stole it and he destroyed it.\n2. It was a gift from a child. It is not replaceable. It came from the heart. It had that child and his two parents. That's natural. Even if you had a bad relationship and bad breakup with the father, you would still accept the gift and the thought behind it if you were a good parent, difficult as that might be. That gift actually has nothing to do with him, so he shouldn't be weighing on in it, let alone destroying it.\n3. He doesn't suffer from an inability to handle stressful situations. He has an anger management problem and lashes out violently, destructively, and abusively. He needs anger management classes and counseling stat. This is not an immutable personality trait. It is fixable. But if he can't change, you need to change your marital status. Don't expose your son to this again.\n4. What was he supposed to do? Behave like an adult. Control his emotions.

It was entirely inappropriate. He had Big Feelings, and I'll even go so far as to say his Big Feelings are valid, at least to the extent that he sincerely felt them and they likely came from a real place of deep-seated trauma (in my case, my BPD was a product of extended childhood neglect), but the way he chose to ACT was inappropriate. It was so far beyond the pale.
