It would have been wise to plan out *with your wife* **beforehand** and agree on what metrics must be met for a child to receive a car as a gift, and at what age. Being able to explain those requirements to all the kids would reassure them this isn\u2019t just the blatant favoritism it could be seen as.\n\nIn the end I want to believe both your hearts are in the right place and that you\u2019re prepared to contribute an equitable sum to the purchase of each additional child\u2019s car should they also reach the metrics. \n\n(And if you aren\u2019t contributing to Jenna\u2019s at all then you\u2019re sewing major seeds of resentment.

Your wife and Jenna's father provide for Jenna.\n\nBut step parents shouldn't be callous, and you *should* try to work together with your spouse to provide similar opportunities to all the kids and step-kids, as appropriate to their ages and needs. You're a blended family and live under the same roof -- Dawn and Jenna have lived side-by-side since they were little -- and your wife is absolutely correct that it creates the appearance of favoritism for one kid to get a hugely expensive gift while the other kid gets jack squat. \n\nYes, your wife is a BIT of an asshole for not simply ringing up Jenna's father to discuss a car for her, and for blaming you for the alcohol thing. But you blindsided her. Could you not have discussed this with her first, and tried to make reasonable arrangements to see that all the kids were treated fairly?", "YTA, and your wife told you why. You failed to consult with her on the decision. Had you done so, the two of you could have worked as a team to decide what course of action was best for the family.

I knew I was an alcoholic deep down but I was in denial about it for a while before I got into recovery. Now, my sobriety is extremely important to me.", "Everyone is different. I was very heavily drinking too the point of having a drink of whiskey every morning when I woke up at my worst.\n\nI don't know if I was an alcoholic, but if been drinking like that for six or seven years. One morning I was looking in the mirror and just didn't like the person looking back at me.\n\nI stopped drinking and smoking that day and didn't drink for nearly four years.\n\nThat said, I didn't get cravings for having a cig, or for having a drink. I felt horrible for about a week but I just holed up in bed a lot of the time. The big thing that helped was a change in lifestyle. I changed my job to a different industry, managed to get out of what was \u00e0n abusive relationship, and started working on some issues with my mental health.\n\nI do occasionally have a beer with my dinner, but it's rare, maybe once a month at most. I don't drink spirits at all. I'll have a couple while out with work, but having to travel home gives me a reason to leave the party early. I never have a beer if I'm feeling stressed or annoyed because I know that one beer won't be enough, no amount of beer will change my mood.\n\nThe simple answer is if you are having problems with alcohol then you'll need to stop drinking and change your lifestyle so that you don't feel you need to depend on something to exist. This is the hardest part about dealing with addiction.", "I am not an alcoholic, but I have relatives who are. It's an addiction, and it never goes away, you can only have it under control by not partaking. It's pretty much the same as drugs or any other addiction. It takes a lot of effort to bring it under control, and takes one slip to fall back deep.", "It's an addiction, it's an all or nothing thing. People who are addicted literally cannot just have own or two cause it leads back down that dark path eventually", "I haven\u2019t had a drink in 9 years.  After 30 years of progressively heavier drinking.  While I likely (easily) met the clinical criteria to have been defined \u201calcoholic,\u201d I don\u2019t like the label:  I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s one size fits all, as it is currently used.  I heavily abused alcohol, but I\u2019m not certain it was through addiction or habit.  \n\nI quit without treatment or therapy.  I had tried to moderate over the years, that never worked for long.  I could quit cold turkey for varying periods, but never felt the \u201creward\u201d for doing so outweighed the comfort from drinking, so would start again after however many days, weeks, or months I took off.\n\nAn \u201calcoholic\u201d will likely be quick to say there is no such thing as \u201crecoverED,\u201d it\u2019s always \u201crecoverING.\u201d  One of the reasons I don\u2019t like the label, it just isn\u2019t something I would always want to define me.  But I do agree that there is likely NO amount of alcohol that would be \u201csafe\u201d for me to return to (regularly) drinking.  The thought of a drink just isn\u2019t tempting anymore, though:  I now know the \u201creward\u201d of sobriety far outweighs the false comfort provided by drinking.", "Check out [r/Alcoholism_Medication](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alcoholism_Medication/). Some people do full abstinence, some people use medicine to help, some do both. Good luck!", "My uncle led AA meetings for 20+ years after he became sober, and he also told me, no amount of a drink is safe.", "Thanks for the reply!  Sometimes I worry about my alcohol intake\u2026 and I think that\u2019s interesting you recognize that you absolutely cannot take a risk with a sip or a couple drinks.  I will say I\u2019m still trying to drink less overall but I have cut back considerably.  I will have 1 drink occasionally while watching sports or to unwind and keep it at that 1 drink.  I feel like in social settings I forget I don\u2019t have the tolerance I once had because I\u2019ve cut back so much and it leads me to getting drunker then I\u2019d like to be on occasion and that\u2019s when the idea of being an alcoholic gets to me as in maybe I don\u2019t have as much will power or control over it as I believe\u2026\n\nHope the best for you though and wish you a happy life!", "You\u2019ve just told my story as well. Two and a half years sober. \nThanks for putting this out there.", "I am in a very similar situation. Thank you for articulating this perfectly, and so wish you the best of luck and health.", "Thanks for the response, very insightful and gives some additional information.  I don\u2019t have to drink everyday, I don\u2019t drink in the morning unless I\u2019m on vacation, but I do believe that I still probably intake more alcohol weekly then I should.  As of late the stress of work has made me drink a little heavier on the weekends.  The fact I used to party a lot and had a higher tolerance also confuses me so sometimes I go out and try to keep up with my old self and next thing you know I\u2019m drunker than originally planned.  I think I still need to work on myself more but overall I think looking at others stories I can see I\u2019ve already gotten to a better point then I had before and ultimately steer away from falling into alcoholism.\n\nThank you for the response and I wish you the best in your choices and adjustments!"]}
