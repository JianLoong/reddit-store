It would have been wise to plan out *with your wife* **beforehand** and agree on what metrics must be met for a child to receive a car as a gift, and at what age. Being able to explain those requirements to all the kids would reassure them this isn\u2019t just the blatant favoritism it could be seen as.\n\nIn the end I want to believe both your hearts are in the right place and that you\u2019re prepared to contribute an equitable sum to the purchase of each additional child\u2019s car should they also reach the metrics. \n\n(And if you aren\u2019t contributing to Jenna\u2019s at all then you\u2019re sewing major seeds of resentment.

Your wife and Jenna's father provide for Jenna.\n\nBut step parents shouldn't be callous, and you *should* try to work together with your spouse to provide similar opportunities to all the kids and step-kids, as appropriate to their ages and needs. You're a blended family and live under the same roof -- Dawn and Jenna have lived side-by-side since they were little -- and your wife is absolutely correct that it creates the appearance of favoritism for one kid to get a hugely expensive gift while the other kid gets jack squat. \n\nYes, your wife is a BIT of an asshole for not simply ringing up Jenna's father to discuss a car for her, and for blaming you for the alcohol thing. But you blindsided her. Could you not have discussed this with her first, and tried to make reasonable arrangements to see that all the kids were treated fairly?", "YTA, and your wife told you why. You failed to consult with her on the decision. Had you done so, the two of you could have worked as a team to decide what course of action was best for the family.

As someone who used to drink a lot, I remember making sure I never blamed anyone but myself. Meeting my wife I almost felt bad drinking around her because she didn\u2019t drink that much and I didn\u2019t want to be a bad influence on her so it actually helped me tone down my drinking.", "\"You made me do this\" is common for all abusers.", "Yep, I didn't want to say it, but they all say it when it's become a problem.", "Stepmom didn\u2019t chip in for Dawn.", "He\u2019s not required to buy step daughter a car. His own daughter got a used car at 18 because she earned it with hard work throughout her preteens and teens in school and at jobs. Keep being a good dad to your daughter.\n\nWhere is stepdaughters father? Does he pay support for his child.", "She\u2019s not legally adopted. OP have no financial responsibility to SD. This kind of mindset made me suspect some people remarry to share financial burden to the stepparents. Wife didn\u2019t share to the car. She should ask the biodad.", "I\u2019m a recovering alcoholic, and even at my absolute worst, never blamed anyone but myself. Yes, there were people in my life that regularly upset me to a degree that I felt vodka was the only way to cope, but it was always still on me and my inability to handle the way they were making me feel in a healthy way. No one forces that bottle into your hand. Wife is beyond manipulative and toxic.", "Yup, same here! Been sober over 5 years and people still upset me to the point that I'm tempted to drink, except I don't - because I, and only I, have control over my sobriety. Which is actually one of the best things about it, tbh.", "Hope you\u2019re doing well! Do you mind if I ask you some questions or do you not speak about your recovery that much? Totally understandable if you don\u2019t just curious about a couple things.", "My aunt has been fighting alcoholism for most of my life. For the first time i feel she's actually doing it for herself now and not just for the courts/  being forced to. I really hope she's successful this time.  However, she has an alcoholic boyfriend who is firmly that a person can't have fun unless they've had several drinks in them. \n\nThe first  year together she stayed strong and refused all alcohol. Often holding an unopened can to make him shut up. Then he started pushing her more and more and more.... until the dam broke and her alcoholism took over again.  Shes had more alcohol related incidents with him in 3 years than she did with 20 years with my late uncle.  He wont change and doesnt see he has an issue. I truly hope she leaves him this year when she realizes he's going to try to drag her back to his level again.", "Also in recovery\u2026ask away (:", "When did you know you were an alcoholic?  Also, do you think it\u2019s possible for recovered alcoholics to have a drink or two or is a 100% cut it out off your life forever deal?"]}
