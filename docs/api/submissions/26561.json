As hard as it is to hear, she is growing up and ready to make her own mistakes.\n\nBut here is where the Vote comes to play\n\nWhile you are reasonable in wanting Will to get tested, that should not be a requirement for her to get on protection for any other scenarios. She will still have sex, you are just ensuring that it will be less safe by refusing to get her the pill UNLESS he tests. Getting her the pill is not enabling her having sex, it's giving her a safety net should she actually go through with exploring her sexuality.

You\u2019re worried about her choices which isn\u2019t the problem but you can\u2019t let those worries lead you to project and or be nasty to her. You also gotta do a much better job at explaining sex ed to your kid. Could\u2019ve hit her with most STIs show no symptoms. Could\u2019ve had a meaningful conversation about BC and their effectiveness and how to pick one for her lifestyle.", ">a player and a womanizer?\n\nYou mean sex-positive and sexually-liberated. Just like you'd say to a woman, sexist\n\nYTA", "Did i read that right \" i thought i was clean when i wasn't\"? Maybe that's why she called you a slut.", "Nta your daughter a dumb ass", "NTA but witholding birthcontrol is not helpful as it will not stop them from having sex, it will just stop them from doing it safely.", "ESH with emphases on you being TA. \n\nYour daughter absolutely shouldn\u2019t have called you a slut. Shaming you for your sexual history wasn\u2019t the move. It also sounded like your daughter was also clearly angry because you\u2019re assuming she will make the exact same mistakes as you have, which will immediately make her defensive. You didn\u2019t say what those mistakes were, but if you were absolutely wild as a kid and you had her and you consider that a mistake, I\u2019d probably want to lash out too? So more context is needed. \n\nNot to mention the very clear biphobia and harsh judgment of her boyfriend\u2019s sex life - which is none of your business beyond educating your daughter (PROPERLY) about safe sex. You said it multiple times in this post so I can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t said it to your daughter, too. \n\nIf you really wanted her to listen, you\u2019d take a second and swallow your own nervousness and prejudice, and truly explain WHY it\u2019s so important. This discussion also should\u2019ve happened YEARS ago, before she felt societal pressure to have sex. You made your own mistakes, so learning from them should\u2019ve been approaching your daughter forever ago properly to avoid them. \n\nDon\u2019t withhold birth control from your daughter. STIs and STDs are devastating enough without adding a child into the mix. I would get her on birth control ASAP and have her apologize for speaking to you that way, and apologize for not handling the situation as a mother properly. Re explain and explain the horrors of stuff like HIV and other things that don\u2019t always show at all. \n\nI do wish you luck. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re trying to do the wrong thing here, and sometimes teens say some wild out of pocket stuff that needs to be handled. You wouldn\u2019t have been wrong for needing to step away from a moment, or expressing how badly that hurt and leaving her to think about that for a moment. \n\nAt the end of the day they\u2019re largely just kids who are running rampant with hormones and pressure. You\u2019re the adult so unfortunately you gotta really be the adult in this case, even though she was an AH for saying that.", "Oh, she's already having sex with him I'm sure. This is about being able to safely drop the condom.", "Yeah in fact they probably already had sex,the request is most likely because Will is tired of buying condoms.", "Oh so she should accept that the boyfriend doesn't get tested as long as her daughter still comes to her once she has her first STD that might make her infertile for life? That's a joke, no? She can't do anything except telling it how it is with these things, there is no coddling and ignoring the risk to be \"kind\" when guys want to get into girls' pants without protection. Kindness doesn't mean giving kids whatever they want because they will do it anyway behind your back if you don't. Kindness can also mean not allowing something or, in this case, allowing the daughter to go on BC \\*if\\* the guy gets tested. Because that would protect the daughter, whether she wants to accept that right now or not.", "She insinuated that the daughter was going to end up pregnant like her, she basically just called her daughter a mistake and wishing she didn\u2019t have her. Seems she\u2019s just as mature as her child, there are better ways of handling this than telling her she needs to have her boyfriend tested as the ultimatum. They are autonomous people that she isn\u2019t around to separate with a stick whenever they get close.", "It's not about INSULTING the boyfriend, it's about being realistic, and realistically, he might give the daughter a couple of STDs. Why can a mother not call a bad choice of a boyfriend a bad choice of a boyfriend? Is THAT going to protect her daughter?", "Pssh my mother had a similar convo with me at that age. I didn\u2019t call her a slut because I understood the mechanics of sex. \nThis kid sounds like she needs to be educated.\nESH", "Who the heck lashed out by calling their mother a slut? I have never done this, it's not normal.", "Yeah, it's expected teenagers will be a bit AHish when discussing sensitive subjects. At least she brought it up. Parents need to be the adults, and becoming judgmental in return does not work so OP YTA.", "My now wife had a rule of no sex before I get a clean STI test. I too thought I was clean cause \u201cI would know\u201d\u2026. I had asymptomatic chlamydia. STIs are SUPER common, and you only need to have sex with one person to get them. Yeah, OP is clearly not a fan of daughters bf, but she has a legitimate concern. STI tests need to be normalized when you change partners, it\u2019s just the decent thing to do. Especially when STIs can have long term effects if untreated/undiagnosed", "You are delusional if you believe STI rates between heterosexual men and bisexual/homosexual men are the same. There have been multiple scientific studies done and the STI rates for men who sleep with other men are multiple times higher.", "You aren\u2019t seriously suggesting him being bi is completely irrelevant to the risk of STDs are you?", "THIS! Idk why OP brought it up in the first place. It seemed out of place considering the topic is about her daughter asking for BC. ESH for sure", "My mom was on the PTA, ran two recall elections of the board of education and became a teacher in a different district. \n\nMy mom knew about all the kids and all the teachers. And the woman had the caginess of a CIA agent in deep cover. So she things I don\u2019t know how she knew. \n\nI\u2019d expect that mom knows more than her kid does.", "Well let\u2019s hope you don\u2019t have a kid because teenagers are pretty fuckin ruthless. I was one of them.", "Come on that's harsh. The kid came to her, she was honest and she perceived her mom's response as shaming Will's sexual history (and honestly I think there's some truth to that). Being a teen she reacted poorly. If OP phrased her concerns better they wouldn't be in this situation, something along the lines of \"I am glad you came to me first, of course I will get you on BC. Beside that it is important to protect your sexual health, would you like to buy condoms or should I drive you and Will for a STDs screening?\"", "Yeah idk what I\u2019d do if my child called me a slut like what do I do? Am I supposed to hit them? I\u2019d have to walk away and decompress before I say anything or do anything else. So rude. Children these days are mean.", "Grounding a 17 year old? Good luck with that lmao", "Well I think the adult thing to do was to de-escalate *in* the moment, telling her calmly how rude, hurtful and misogynistic that remark is. However, OP unfortunately met her on a 17yo level and exchanged basic insults with her daughter.  It's a shame emotions got the best of this conversation bc it *should have been* a teaching/learning moment. ESA but mom, unfortunately (and as usual) has to take the majority of the AH blame here. She was supposed to be the adult.", "She's... projecting her feelings of what her boyfriend did onto her mother, the old, it takes one to know one thing.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with suggesting STI tests, which is why I didn\u2019t criticise that part in my comment?", "\"Children these days are mean\"\n\nAnd whose fault is that? It's your job as a parent to deal with that. Mimimi, my child is mean, so what? OP was mean, OP's parents were mean, everyone is mean when they have their first bf/gf and their parents forbid you from having sex.\n\nAs a parent you should have your emotions under control when dealing with you child, without hitting them or needing time to decompress. Even when they are mean.\n\nAlso OP getting a child at age 20 (so: college) and telling their child that she has to live with mistakes she made in college? Yeah, getting pregnant was probably one of them and now she wants the hr same for her daughter by dening her at least the most basic form of protection she can get for her.", "Girls absolutely NEED to demand their partners get tested, especially at such a young age and when the girl is inexperienced and the boy is not. This is what all mums should teach their daughters. No test, no sex. What about this is complicated or inappropriate or unrealistic? In my country, we are actually told this at school and by our gynos and it's a general idea that's out there, so that mothers don't have to be the \"lone bad ones\" for trying to talk sense into their teenage girls. This whole discussion is in fact ridiculous.", "Teenage pregnancies are MUCH more likely to happen when the teen's parents refuse contraception. The daughter was out of line, but Mom's a moron if she thinks withholding the pill will solve anything. She's putting her daughter on track to be a mom as early as she was.", "Um, why can\u2019t they use both pills and condoms? Or prevent pregnancy doubly and STD\u2019s?", "My mistake then. I clearly your read your comment incorrectly. Apologies!", "I have no control over other peoples children. \n\nAnd just because you have a child doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t respect your own feelings when they\u2019ve been hurt. You\u2019re allowed to feel your feelings and decompress from negative emotions. Pushing it aside does nothing and is not constructive. \n\nMy child called me a slut. I have a right to be mad. I have a right to walk away and take a breather before coming back to deal with the situation in a manner not shrouded in negativity. \n\nAlso she\u2019s not denying her child anything. She simply said she won\u2019t enable her ability to have sex. The daughter can get on BC whenever she wants because she\u2019s over 16 and doesn\u2019t need her parents permission. \n\nShe simply said, I\u2019ve made mistakes in my life and I do not want to see this happen to you so please use protection and make sure he gets tested due to his sexual history.", "Yes, I agree with you in that I'm being naive. It's already clear that the daughter is very immature - her mother is trying to have a serious conversation with her and she calls her a slut. Her BF is no doubt in her ear telling her he can't get hard wearing a condom, I've heard it all before.\n\nIt's a pity that there's such little attitude change when it comes to the male partner's responsibility when it comes to unwanted pregnancy, it's 100% the female partner's responsibility eh?", "The daughter seems to be aware though that BC is how you actually prevent pregnancies, not \"pulling out\", otherwise they would have just done it already without her asking. She can still make bad decisions, but it's not like a mother HAS TO enable one (in this case her daughter getting herself some STDs) because otherwise the kid will make another one (risking a pregnancy) and blame her for it. That's how you raise children who don't take any responsibility for their actions. And yes, the kids will do whatever they do eventually, so what is wrong with a mother not enabling what she feels is her job not to enable..?", "You're right in that teenagers are stupid, good thing all teenage girls are so clever and organised that they never forget to take their daily pill or have gastro and accidentally vomit it up. That's how my brother was conceived BTW.", "If anything, the daughter even coming to the mother about having sex says a lot about their relationship and OP and daughter should take a step back and realise the amount of trust they have for eachother and know yeah my words weren\u2019t right, but the intent to be there for you was there.", "but then the 1000000 daily posts about \"why does my family hate me\" dont stop", "\u201cYou can still die in a car crash if you wear a seatbelt, so why wear seatbelts?\u201d"]}
