Jess has been dating Will (18M) for about 3 months, and she is over the moon about it. The thing about Will is before he was in a relationship with my daughter, he had dozens of sexual relationships with both boys and girls from their school and other places.  From what my daughter has told me, he did not take a lot, if any precautions with most of these people. Recently, Jess sat me down and asked if she could go on birth control. Obviously I asked what had changed, and she was open and told me that her and Will had been thinking about taking their relationship to the next level. This made me nervous because I made mistakes when I was in high school and college, and I had to live with the consequences of my actions. I told my daughter if she wanted to go on birth control and have sex, she had to make Will get tested. She was immediately offended, saying that Will was clean, and had no signs of anything from his previous relationships. I said she needed to be safe, and that I thought I thought I as clean when I wasn\u2019t. My daughter said I was just a slut and I didn\u2019t need to worry about her. I found this really hurtful, and I snapped back that it wasn\u2019t my fault that her boyfriend is a player and a womanizer, and just wants to get in her pants. After that, I said I will not enable her having sex if she doesn\u2019t make him get tested. She stormed off and left in her car, and won\u2019t pick up her phone.

Your daughter is the AH but you\u2019re fueling the teenage rebellion fire.\n\nThe fact is: she\u2019s going to have sex with her boyfriend regardless of if you like it or not. Maybe now she will do it to get back at you. \n\nAt least get her on BC. Urge them to get tested again but do it from a lens of kindness and make sure she knows its about respecting herself and him respecting the relationship. \n\nYou want to make sure she still feels comfortable coming to you about these things, especially if she does it anyways and something goes wrong.", "You told her she should get her bf tested and she called you a slut? She is definitely an AH. And definitely not mature enough for the card keys. Though your comments weren't really helpful.\n\n ESH", "NTA, but for sure, I would get her on the pill just so that she can begin to be safe. I would 100% say that slutshaming you is never okay or doing that to anyone, and there should be some repercussions for that. I would also explain to her that sex on birth control isn't safe sex unless a condom is also used. If they do anything with a condom she is unsafe and exposing herself to risk. I would reiterate the fact that some STIs could last a lifetime, so there is no sense to risk it. If he wishes not to use a condom she should make sure he is STI free before agreeing to that, considering he has been with other people. If he doesn't like it, then he doesn't care about her safety.", "NTA. You told it like it is. It's a reasonable request that he gets tested before starting a sexual relationship with someone new, your daughter needs to learn this otherwise she'll end up with an STD.", "ESH because you both said things insulting each other for no reason. Your daughter is going to be intimate with her boyfriend whether you like it not, the most you can do is help her get on birth control and convince her of the important of using condoms regardless. This is the time for a safe sex conversation, not a chance to insult her boyfriends past sex life.", "NTA. Truth hurts.", "YTA because you're supposed to be the adult. She insulted you, but let's be real: no kid likes to think about their parent's sex lives, and lashing out when being confronted with it is pretty normal. You retaliated by bringing up Will's past instead of simply explaining that getting tested should be standard practice for any sexually active person.\n\nThe thing you *could* have said is that if he doesn't want to use condoms with her, he probably has had sex without a condom in the past, and also just say that not all STD's show obvious symptoms, including the worst which is obviously HIV. But instead you decided to slut-shame her boyfriend, which obviously would put her on the defensive.", "YTA\n\nShe came to you to ask about getting on the pill because she wants to know she is safe going to you. It doesn't matter the why so much, what matters is she is trying to be responsible. Even if she wasn't with Will, you should consider taking her to get the pill. She is at the age now that she is going to start exploring her body and relationships. As hard as it is to hear, she is growing up and ready to make her own mistakes.\n\nBut here is where the Vote comes to play\n\nWhile you are reasonable in wanting Will to get tested, that should not be a requirement for her to get on protection for any other scenarios. She will still have sex, you are just ensuring that it will be less safe by refusing to get her the pill UNLESS he tests. Getting her the pill is not enabling her having sex, it's giving her a safety net should she actually go through with exploring her sexuality. Putting it behind an ultimatum is setting her up to fail.\n\nOverall, she is trying to be at least responsible in not getting pregnant, mom. Please please please get her the tools she needs for her to be safe. You cannot control what Will does, or what she does, but you can at least help her get protections to prevent as much as possible. Please get her on Birth Control. Don't lock her protections behind an ultimatum like that.", "What?\n\nThis is just another paragraphless bit of fiction. How in the shit would your main character have the omniscience required to know all of this about their fictional daughter's boyfriend?", "NTA- you are just looking out for her in the way someone should've been looking out for you.  I would not let her get away with such blatant disrespect otherwise you might find it continuing", "NTA, this is a reasonable request and people who are mature enough to be in these types of relationships should be willing to ask these things of their potential partners. But just remember that they will do what they want whether you get her on birth control or not.", "ESH. There was no reason for your daughter to call you a slut.\n\nBut, you\u2019re excessively judgemental of her boyfriend and his past, and don\u2019t think no one picked up on your blatant homophobia given your need to include the fact that her boyfriend is bi despite it having no relevance to the risk of STDs beyond bigoted stereotypes.\n\nAlso you should have gotten her on the pill already if that was ever an option to you. She\u2019s 17, you should have been preparing for this years ago.\n\nYou\u2019re also projecting your own mistakes onto your kid and that\u2019s really not healthy for either of you.\n\nYour daughter shouldn\u2019t have lashed out, but you need grow up and re-examine your biases.", "So you would rather she have unprotected sex\u2026.?", "YTA. It is not your decision if she has sex. If you want her to have a child at 17 you're playing this perfectly.", "NTA. you\u2019re looking out for your daughters safety and she\u2019ll just regret not listening.", "ESH.\nThis is exceedingly fictional, but also, please stop using \u201cclean\u201d to mean STI negative.

You don\u2019t want your daughter to make mistakes or get God knows what diseases he may have. But at the same time, he was a kid. He was experiencing. There was no need to take it as far to insult Will. Now your daughter didn\u2019t have to call you a slut either but still. You are the parent. Take control of your actions and talk to her more nicely.", "Get her on birth control. They are already doing it.", "NTA - You are trying to protect your daughter from ruining her life. Sometimes that means saying no and being the bad guy for a hot minute. That is the thankless job of a parent. The sign of a good parent is knowing when to use tough love. How she acted would warrent car privilages also being revoked in my house but that is up to you. Lots of folks here will give her a free pass. Some will insist you treat her like a child and sugar coat serious conversations. Those folks never had to raise a child. Best of luck to you.", "YTA\n\nYou are the adult in this situation. Your daughter was a dick, but you went about this completely wrong. All you are doing by preventing her from going on birth control is upping the odds that you'll be a grandparent soon.", "YTA, she's even less safe without birth control.", "You made mistakes? You're gonna end up with a big mistake of a grandchild of you withhold contraception or shame her about this guy\n\nYTA", "Yeah this is the one. Teenagers will do everything and anything to have sex, *especially* if their parents strictly forbid it. Think back to when you were in high school and ask yourself how you would've wanted your parent to react to hearing about you becoming sexually active. \n\nHonestly if my child talked to me like that they wouldn't have car keys to use to go anywhere. Phone privileges would disappear immediately too. Actions have consequences and the sooner she learns that the less STIs she'll get.", "I don\u2019t think withholding contraception is going to help the situation", "Op said they were having a safe sex conversation before the daughter called her a slut?

I graduated highschool over 10 years ago and she still has updates on people that I do not even remember existing.", "I dont understand what's so unrealistic about this", "Nothing she can do about the sex or disrespect by that age.  She needs to watch her mouth just as much as her daughter. ESH", "Sex on birth control is unprotected sex...", "OP probably rathers her daughter not call her a slut.", "Or will it? If she's not on the pill then the BF will have to wear a condom and her daughter will be better protected from STDs.", "I think I interpreted it differently. Her daughter came to her asking for help getting on birth control because she and her boyfriend want to become intimate, and OP said she immediately got nervous because of her own mistakes when she was younger and said that she\u2019ll only help her if her boyfriend gets tested first. Now.. I understand wanting a sexual partner to get tested, but you cannot control what other people do. Her daughter being at such a young age is not going to demand her partner get tested, so what she could do instead is help her get on birth control and have a \u201csafe sex\u201d conversation about using condoms regardless.", "Mother is also insulting the daughters boyfriend\u2019s sex life.

Thinking that he'll magically decide to wear a condom if she doesn't have access to contraception is like praying as the only form of protection/contraception. Hopefully, he will wear one. However, he may gamble & ghost if she does  get pregnant. There's no guarantee that *he* will use protection. If she's on BC, then at least she's got *some* protection. Although condoms would be ideal due to the risk of STDs/STIs alone.", ">have to wear a condom\n\nAs if teenagers have never said \u201cI can pull out in time.\u201d Are you fucking serious?", "Yeah because teen pregnancies never happen and teens never do stupid things when they're horny", "I mean yea  that's what I said in my judgement too. I said esh for the same reason. I just don't know how to expect the mother to have a safe sex conversation with the daughter if this is how she reacts.\n\nI agree with your assessment or your judgement.

She isn't 18 lmao", "I suppose i knew more about my children than they thought I did. They informed on each other - it was hilarious. I think it truly depends on how interested the parent is. You meet their friends and bf/gf's. Also talk to friend's parents. You don't want to control them, just know they will be okay. Every parent / child relationship is different, and of course they will only tell you about 1/3 of what is happening.", "Buddy have u ever considered that her daughter told her about him?
