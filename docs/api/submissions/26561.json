She is at the age now that she is going to start exploring her body and relationships. As hard as it is to hear, she is growing up and ready to make her own mistakes.\n\nBut here is where the Vote comes to play\n\nWhile you are reasonable in wanting Will to get tested, that should not be a requirement for her to get on protection for any other scenarios. She will still have sex, you are just ensuring that it will be less safe by refusing to get her the pill UNLESS he tests. Getting her the pill is not enabling her having sex, it's giving her a safety net should she actually go through with exploring her sexuality.

That's typical for young people and yes they usually do what they want anyway but I haven't seen any proof that ENABLING their bad choices makes things better.

They are not entitled to every adult phrasing that conversation in exactly the way it suits their feelings, and their parents not having the best pedagogic approach doesn't absolve them from not being stupid.

Personally, I know that my parents were very informative and helpful to myself and my brother growing up, and we were comfortable talking to them and asking for help with birth control etc. and we have never had any problems. If they didn\u2019t like my partner that was okay but they wouldn\u2019t forbid me from seeing someone and let me make my own decisions. I know a lot of friends when I was younger that had super strict parents that WOULD forbid them from seeing certain people, and they would find a way to see them anyway behind their parents backs.

Her daughter knows how things work and she has no problem talking to her mum about it, and they seem very open. She is just being a 17-year-old who thinks she knows better, and that's not going to be helped by her mum not putting her foot down re STD tests. There is no indication she ever forbid or plans to forbid her daughter from dating this guy or having sex. She is JUST telling her STD tests should come BEFORE sex. I really don't know why I'm having to defend this position so much.", "The daughter asked for help getting on birth control, which is great. But the mother immediately has said she will only help her get on birth control if she forces her boyfriend to get tested first. We\u2019ll have to agree to disagree.", "No you are making things up now to serve your narrative - the mother did not \"immediately\" say she needs to \"force\" her bf to do anything - at least that's not what she posted here. She says she told her daughter STD tests need to come first and used her own past mistakes as a reason why and as a reason why you can't necessarily know that you are \"clean\". If that is not an open, honest mother-daughter discussion then I don't know what is. The daughter is the one who was offended (why? that's not necessary) and insisted she knows better than her mum who birthed and raised her (that's also really weird for someone who never had or only just started having sex) - and she is the one who insulted her mum for not just giving her what she wanted. That sounds extremely entitled and intentionally irresponsible to me - the girl is 17, not 14, and it seems she did have sex education and has a mum who talks about stuff.  Completely bizarre to me, coming from a country where teenagers having sex is quite normal and accepted - but they are told (how) not to be stupid about it."]}
