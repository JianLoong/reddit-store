He sounds either selfish or has OCD or similar.", "NTA. If he can't remember where he's moving your stuff to, he obviously isn't putting it in the correct spot. I don't know if this is an OCD/other mental health issue, or if he's just being controlling, but he's very much in the wrong here. You aren't leaving things strewn about the house, you've clearly and intentionally put these items away. And he keeps losing them for you. It's very disrespectful on his part.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like your husband needs to seek help or he\u2019s controlling. Not only should he replace the missing items, please tell him this isn\u2019t normal behavior and needs to be addressed. \n\nWhy? Because he\u2019s not King of your house and he doesn\u2019t get to just move stuff you have due to him not liking it. It\u2019s ridiculous that a grown man is acting like this (unless in the case he needs behavioral help.)", "NTA Your husband's habit of moving things and not telling you he's moved them is annoyingly infuriating and downright obnoxious. Don't presume to know why someone left something somewhere and move it. It's not that hard.", "I'd stick a note on these kinds of items telling him not to touch. That's what he's asking for, right?  Your house will be full of notes that say \"I meant to do this\".  Then, the notes will make him crazy.", "NTA. Therapy would seem to be a great idea, but for your husband.  His behavior is not respectful or considerate, and borders on obsessive.", "WTF NTA... why would you need to go to therapy when he has this weird compulsive need to control where everything goes?   \n\n\nI live with my partner and she has her own space and she can put things wherever she likes in that space and I've got my own space and when it comes to shared spaces we discuss... cause we respect each other.   \n\n\nI was gonna say that its just a miscommunication between you guys but that comment about you needing therapy defiantly pushes this into your husband is TA space for me.", "NTA.\n\nSeriously, if he says there's a place for something but can't remember where he put it, he is way out of line.

I'm a 55 year old woman and have been married for 27 years. My husband knows not to move stuff. I told him early on that if it is there, then I put it there for a reason and don't move it. He should ask me first.\n\nThe fact that he moves your stuff (or throws it away without asking), then can't remember where he moved it is troubling. He is young and should remember where he moved it.\n\nI may get downvoted for this, but you need to get this young man trained properly. If not, this will continue to drive you crazy.\n\nMen need guidance and training sometimes. Downvote me all you want people. I don't care.\n\nEdit: Geez! I don't mean training like a dog. For god's sake! I just meant that early on, I told my husband to always ask before he moved something or threw it away. And I do the same with him.

This sounds to me like micro aggression.", "NTA. Yes everything has its place but you are two people in the home and he doesn't unilaterally get to decide where everything goes, especially when it's your personal belongings or things you have bought.\n\nIt sounds like he's the one who needs to go to therapy if he feels he needs to have such control over the household that you can't even place your own things where you want them.", "NTA\n\nWho died and made him king?", "NTA\n\nI am the organizer of my relationship (probably slightly OCD) and can empathize with his wanting some order to where things go. I cannot, however, understand how he'd have the nerve to be angry over you exercising your right to keep stuff where you'd like as well. A few simple conversations on his part explaining what some of his plans are and you two coming to a compromise TOGETHER is what people in healthy relationships do. Sounds like he's prioritizing what he wants and disregarding your feelings about the same matter.", "ESH. Go see a relationship counselor that teaches you how to communicate. \n\nHow can your husband just move something, not tell you, and forget where he puts it? That makes literally no sense. \n\nWhy do you not tell him when you're putting stuff somewhere? \"Hey babe I'm gonna put the bathroom hardware in the linen closet\" then you have a discussion about it. \n\nLearn how to communicate.", "NTA, he shouldn't be moving things without your permission, he should replace the missing belongings. Bad behavior coming from your husband.", "NTA I mean him moving stuff around is normal but not telling you or not knowing where it is, is just messed up", "You're NTA. It isn't as though he is putting away clutter that you're leaving all over the place. He needs to take a step back and realize no one appointed him the Emperor of Organization.", "NTA.
