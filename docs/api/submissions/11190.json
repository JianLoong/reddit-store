Even if Baby wasn't a service dog, you still have the right to determine who pets her. Your co-worker has no right to tell people to pet your dog. In fact, her doing so is reckless. It sounds like leaving that job was the best thing for you. Give Baby some extra ear scratches from me!", "NTA but think you should have reported Francis to HR the first time she yelled at yo7 and followed up each time her behavior was inappropriate.", "No, you did not do the wrong thing. Francis did, repeatedly. And she is doing people who have intellectual and cognitive disabilities a disservice but treating them this way. You are NTA, from someone who has PTSD and is also Autistic.", "NTA - I can't form sentences about how very much NTA you are. A service dog is not a pet.", "NTA, but go bring this issue to your manager and ask them to shut Francis down for you.", "NTA. Report Francis to HR. Tell them about how your dog is a service animal and needs to be focused to do it's job. Let them know Francis is encouraging people to ignore your boundaries around it and potentially putting you in danger.", "NTA, you did nothing wrong, you only tried to enforce your boundaries which Francis seemed hell-bent on breaching. Some people have no respect at all.\n\nGood for you for getting out of there. Hopefully you've found something much better.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like Frances is a real problem. I think you need to put in a formal complaint about her, because she seriously overstepped a boundary. You asked that your service animal not be disturbed unless you gave prior permission, and Frances decided to ignore you. You don't have to allow anyone to pet the dog, whether they're disabled or not. If Frances could say \"it's okay to pet the dog\", she could easily have said \"it's not okay to oet the dog\".\n\nFrances sounds like she's on this job because she has trouble relating to other adults who aren't disabled. Perhaps she's made this job her own personal fiefdom and so thinks she has the right to ride roughshod over the other support workers. This isn't the case. Her behaviour is highly unprofessional. She should've been reprimanded by the boss the first time, and then let go the second time.\n\nI would recommend writing a letter to HR stating what happened and how Frances did not respect your right as a vulnerable person to be safe at work. That her attitude towards you was hostile and uncalled for, and she did not display professionalism, courtesy or respect to you. \n\nThat she has been hostile towards you in the past, so much so that your boss's intervention was required, and the previous episode affected your mental health to the extent that you were hospitalised. That she was so hostile towards you this time that you felt you had no choice but to resign.\n\nA formal complaint like that would be more likely to go on Frances's employment record, and maybe she would have to undergo mandatory retraining and/or be put on probation.", "A service dog is considered a medical device, just as a prosthetic leg is or a wheelchair.\n\nPeople taking liberties with someone's prosthetic leg are definitely TA. Same with a Service dog.", "NTA. Baby is a service dog not a therapy dog and you handled it perfectly \n\nYour coworker needs to be fired- I seriously doubt HR would support their actions if they had accurate information on the situation and people who have developmental disabilities are still people and deserve to be treated as people not infantilised (like the coworker did) - that\u2019s degrading", "NTA Francis a trouble maker. She should have been disciplined or let go of.", "NTA.  You reacted perfectly.  Francis is a huge AH.  She has no respect for your boundaries.", "NTA. There are very few scenarios in which it\u2019s ok to touch someone without consent, and randomly at work \u201cbecause I want to\u201d definitely isn\u2019t one of them. Same with touching the dog. Nobody should touch anyone\u2019s animals without consent of the owner, even more so when it\u2019s a service dog.", "NTA. Francis seems to think other people's desire to touch/pet means more than your reasonable desire to manage your own space and service animal.", "NTA\n\nI have a disability and I was always taught to never distract a service dog because they're working. I was also taught to not touch anyone who didn't want to be touched.", "NTA but i have a similar background and i would suggest not allowing anyone to pet Baby at work. Because it might be hard for others to understand if/when it\u2019s ok to pet, especially when they have disabilities too. You can even get a \u2018do not pet\u2019 patch and put it on a vest or leash.", "NTA, standard rule is no one should be petting a service dog when they are working.", "YTA to yourself. You should have reported her to HR and got her fired. \n\nIf they hadn't fired her, you could have had a lawsuit.", "What if Baby was spooked and bit/scratched the person petting her? Is Francis going to be responsible? There\u2019s a liability that comes with having a support animal with you. You don\u2019t need an outsider to get involved with the interactions with your dog!", "NTA.\n\nBut you really should not have quit or at least reported Francis for creating a hostile work environment. You were minding your own business and that person just kept on encouraging other people to stomp on your boundaries. They should be replirmanded and/or fired.", "NTA. As a person with a Service Dog - I also allow people to pet him if they ask. He has a certain command to greet them and knows the return to work command as well. Francis needs to be corrected and reported for interfering with you and your medically required service dog. Now, slight correction - even if you were helping a disabled person, Baby should not have been left unattended or away from your side. This is by ADA standards of a Service Dog.", "NTA. Dogs are NOT public property and all the other people should have been taught to NOT bother the service dog. That is your personal medical device and was not her place to give anyone permission to pet your dog. Susan should have never touched your pup at all, and should have been instructed to ignore her. The other employee should have been written up for her unprofessional and disrespectful behavior toward you.\n\nYou had tht right to let no one pet your dog. She's yours and is working. Everyone is taught not to touch service dogs. They where completely in the wrong. You literally have excellent grounds for a harassment suit against her.", "NTA\n\n>One day, one of the individuals reached over to poke me. I just stepped out of arms reach, a reaction my therapist would have been proud of. However, my coworker, Francis, got really mad at me. \"He just wanted to hold your hand! You probably hurt his feelings!\"\n\nThat's cute.  My right to bodily autonomy (which include the right to not be touched without permission) is more important than anyone's \"hurt feelings\", developmental disability or not.  I guess according to Francis, if the person wanted to sleep with me, I have to let them because saying no would \"hurt their feelings\"?\n\nFrancis is wildly unprofessional and actively harming her fellow employees by insisting they tolerate behaviors they find intolerable.  She also lied about you to HR, and maligned your reputation.  She absolutely needs to be fired.  I understand that you've left your job, but I wonder if you could report her after the fact.  The woman is dangerous.", "YTA for not reporting Francis to HR for her behavior/actions.  She not only put you and your dog at risk, but she also put other people with disabilities at risk. What happens when those people that she's been working with go out into the real world and don't know how to read situations properly. She works with people with disabilities. She should know better than to sit there and say it's OK for somebody to pet a service dog.\n\nYou had every right to not be touched. Whether you have PTSD or not, if you don't want somebody touching you, you don't want somebody touching you. That is your boundary, and that is your right. It is also your right not to have somebody pet your service dog. Of course, it is your right even if Baby was not a service dog, to tell people not to pet them.\n\n I am sorry that you had to leave a job because somebody could not respect rules and boundaries. I really truly hope that Francis got fired.\n\nEdit: Sorry, it was Francis, not Susan, that is the AH", "INFO: Is your dog a certified service dog? Does he wear a service dog vest?
